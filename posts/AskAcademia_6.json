I am the interviewer and the data analyst and the author--I'm all of it because it's for a term project. I am also LGBT--can I share that with participants or is that unethical or coercive?\n\n I was just thinking that maybe if I share personal information to help them feel more at ease (that is: I want them to know I'm not a cisgender heterosexual person here to observe them like lab rats, I'm trying to create information that can help my/their community). But if I'm sharing personal information to \"lull\" them into security--is that coercive or manipulative?\n\nIf so-- could I simply share that I am also LGBT and just not get specific? Like that way I'm verifying that I'm not an outsider, but also not being so personal that they may feel unduly obligated to share more than they would otherwise?\n\nI wouldn't share this immediately before asking personal questions. It would more or less be an \"about me\" section before I did anything else in the survey including asking for consent (or I guess maybe it would come better *after* consent if I'm worried about coercion?)\n\nThanks in advance for advice.",

        "text": "I am an enthusiastic amateur in the field of literary studies, with an intriguing theory regarding some author(s), involving a very niche but somewhat ignored perspective at their work.\n\nI haven’t come across anything that specifically looks at it, despite extensive reading. I think there are specific, identifiable reason for this neglect. \n\nOver a year ago I decided to try and research my idea, to see if it was credible. I thought I would be able to show it was  possible but not provable so my first goal was to gather circumstantial evidence.\nMy research has gone better than I hoped so far and I think I can make a strong case for it being actually correct (not just circumstantially).\n\nI am not quite sure what to do next. I would love it to be peer reviewed as I know that what I lack most is a critical look at it, as well as all the potential guidance one can get in academia. I am not looking for free labour and obviously there would be aspects to address with a potential reviewer regarding their involvement but at this stage I am trying to figure out how and when to make any contact.\n\nI have come across the email address of several scholars in the field I am looking at, either in some of their publications or because they are faculty somewhere.\nI could try emailing a couple, but I worry that this would come across as rude or waste their time.\n\nEven if was reassured that it wouldn’t be perceived that way, I don’t know what stage that contact would be best at. I have a draft text of around 30k words now so I have something to show, but not sure if I should get the text to be almost publication ready (assuming that I can achieve this on my own).\n\nMy goal would of course be publication. With the right guidance (and assuming validation by scholars in the field), my material could be potentially developed in a small book by fleshing out some of the points, or by carrying on with the research. \n\nAlternatively it could be summarised to be published as a shorter essay, either in a general literary journal, or in a specialist journal about the author(s) in question.\n(There is indeed a well know journal about this author and their website says they accept manuscripts).\n\nWhatever I do, I really want to give my theory the best shot. I am conscious that as a non academic, any willingness to engage I get from any scholar would be potentially limited- I don’t want to jump in too early and waste any potential relationship, but I am not sure how far I can take this working on my own. Does anyone have any recommendations?\n\nFor info: the most likely country of publication would be France as this is where the authors are from, although there are some excellent scholars researching them in anglophone countries. My theory is currently written in French but it wouldn’t be impossible to translate it.",

The copied section is so obvious because it's in a different font and size to the rest of the letter. This section takes up 67 of the 170 words used in the reference, and lists the full names of the course, department, and school. It also says that I am currently working on my dissertation, which is incorrect because I graduated four months ago. \n\nThe other half of the reference is positive, yet a bit generic. He wrote things like \"user is a great student\", but nothing specific about our time working together or his experience of my research ability (relevant as he supervised my research for over a year and I am applying for research-heavy positions) ....\n\nI dont know, the more i re-read it the more I doubt myself. I am very thankful that he wrote this letter, and I see that the latter half is objectively positive, albeit brief. But I fear the copied and pasted beginning makes the rest of the letter appear so impersonal that it will hurt my application. \n\nI would greatly appreciate some advice on how to respond. I've never read a letter of recommendation before - is a short n sweet letter like this normal? I definitely need him to fix the factual inaccuracies with my graduation date, but is it too pushy to ask for things like the copied-and-pasted fonts to be changed? or to ask for him to include some details about our time working together?",

I have been in college since 2015, doing   my Bachelor’s and Master’s, taking more time that I was supposed to due   to first, physical health (shoulder surgery) and then mental health. I   had family problems that kind of triggered my mental health decline  like  4 years ago. Grandma had cancer, tried to commit suicide. Then my  mom  had a psychotic break, tried to commit suicide, multiple psych   hospitalizations over the course of 2 years. My productivity, grades,   life overall just went down to shit when that happened.\n\nSince   then, I have been to 3 therapists (on the 3rd one right now) and my   college performance has been a rollercoaster (either doing 0 courses a   semester or max 2-3 with low grades). My family problems have been   STABLE for the last 1.5-2 years but I still am all fucked up.\n\nI   haven’t done any courses since Fev 2022, and started my thesis 3  months  ago with a professor that I always loved to work with, but this   probably was a bigger step that I should have taken right now. I have   missed multiple meetings with my advisor, just keep rescheduling them,   doing barely any work. Recently my subject changed because the first one   (which was awesome) was more difficult, requiring more work. I don’t   feel as interested in this new subject as in the first one. I need to   revisit and re-study multiple subjects and study them again because for   the last 3-4 years there have been huge time gaps where I barely did  any  studying. But the problem is that I can't do the work, I can't  study.\n\nI  am obese(120kg), have  liver problems, and stomach problems. I can’t  focus, study for exams,  or read research papers to work on my thesis.  Most days I oversleep  until 12-1pm, I eat like shit (pizzas, burgers  etc), feel lost, feel  unmotivated. I binge watch shows, movies, yt  videos like crazy because I  don’t feel stupid or dumb while watching  them. They’re my escape but  feel bad afterwards. Sleep schedule is  non-existent, don’t do any  exercise. I feel like I am wasting my life,  wasting a good opportunity  regarding my thesis and advisor. Feel angry,  frustrated, unmotivated to  do anything, depressed, uninterested,  irritated all the time and can't  concentrate. Regularly there are  periods of time where I don’t shower,  go out, or clean my bedroom. I  feel I am on a breaking point and don’t  know what to do.\n\nI  have tried to  change some things over the years but these changes never  stick, I  quickly return to the same “comfortable, safe, whatever ”  shitty  place.These last years I have just been plowing through all this  to get  some courses done to get my degree. However, I feel like giving  up. I  am thinking of: explaining the situation to my advisor and  quitting my  thesis for some time, maybe 1-2 years.\n\nRight   now I would focus on my mental health, going full throttle on therapy,   improve my physical health and then finish those courses. Getting a  job  in like 6 months or so, work for a while and when I am ready  then   return to the university and see if I can still work with the same   professor and do my thesis. I really want to do my thesis and get my   degree, I just feel that I CAN’T do it right now.\n\nIs   this a good decision? Taking some time off? I really don’t see a way  to  keep going with my courses and thesis work when I don’t and am not  able  to work. If I just wait to see what happens I think that my  advisor  will cancel my thesis because he can’t wait forever. Thesis is  6m- 1  year top and it is already a bit delayed.\n\nHowever,   I feel that stopping, quitting my thesis is a huge failure. I kept   going for a long time and now right at the end of the fucking degree I   quit? In my head quitting is either the worst or the best thing that I   could do. What if I quit and don’t fix anything and everything stays the   same? I feel I am wasting opportunities, delaying the degree even more   without a fucking idea of what the fuck I should do.\n\nSorry for the long text but I really don’t know what to do.\n\nThanks.",

Would it be ok if the seminar content is not 100% about the area in my research statement? I’ve been working on a certain direction when I started my current position. That certain direction is not in my proposed directions. But I got some good publications and the topic interested students in another university (not interview) in the past. Can I still spend ~30% of time talking about that direction? \n\n2. I have an ongoing project for 1.5 yr. There are some interesting, unpublished results but not yet organized well to the extent of a full presentation. Do I have to bring up these results in the seminar just because this is my latest work? Or I can reserve those to one-to-one conversation? \n\n3. What might be some good advices on handling questions about a highly collaborative project? Some of my projects are 50% experiments 50% theory. The story will be more full with both components and I can handle the basic theory parts. But I do not want to pretend I know theory if anyone asked me theory questions. Can I directly say that I’m not the best person to answer these questions? \n\n4. What slide template would you use? My current institute does not know about the interview so I was debating about using the current institute theme or shall I use past institute’s theme when I talk about past work…?",

He moved with me to the city my institute is located in when I started my PhD. We are at the point in the relationship where getting engaged is in the foreseeable future, and are currently just waiting on some logistics to fall into place. \n\nThe issue is that we would like to have multiple children at some point. I'm wondering when a suitable time to do so would be if I pursue an academic career. Taking my partner and I's age gap into account, I would like to be able to do so before I am 30 so that we both get to enjoy as much time as possible with our children. I'm thinking that it would most likely have to happen during the later years of my PhD or during a postdoc, but am unsure of what kind of impact this would have professionally.\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who has had children during grad school/early on in their research career.  I'm more than willing to make the necessary career sacrifices in order to have a family, but I would like to know what this can look like realistically. I should also add that I am on some psychiatric medication that I would have to stop when pregnant. Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "I just started the alternate route program at my school district, and am currently debating whether I should get my Master's, since I want to teach English/the humanities at the high school level as a stepping stone to being a college professor. My mentor, a former teacher of mine, and other people I've talked to have advised me to get my certification in Education and then the subject area Master's as soon as possible, since I will accumulate benefits and pay over the long run and thank my younger self. \n\nThe issue is that I have heard some very negative things about humanities graduate school programs, obviously because of the awful job market right now and how many people get into debt by borrowing insane amounts in student loans. I already have debt from my undergrad degree, and what really angers me is that grad schools in my situation don't offer any fellowships I can apply to so I can cover the cost of my education, leaving me with two options: hunting for scholarships, and/or paying for grad school out of pocket. I'm not taking out another penny in loans, and that is a promise I made to myself. \n\nThe other thing that bothers me is how poorly paid so many adjunct professors seem to be, and how becoming tenured is essentially a crapshoot unless you really distinguish yourself or get lucky. The professors from my own alma mater recently went on strike because the university wasn't paying them enough to cover their living expenses, and didn't give them any health insurance. The university caved in eventually and gave the professors and union reps a massive raise + benefits, but this highlights a huge problem in academia that is only getting worse these days: that is, the adjunctification, or gigification, or McDonaldization of the academic sphere, as more and more colleges turn into for-profit corporate mills designed to exploit students, teachers, and everyone for the benefit of a few bankrolling college elites (Provosts, Presidents, etc). \n\nThere's also the issue of the humanities becoming less and less viable as a career path because of job scarcity, combined with the high cost of living, and the looming threat of AI. STEM/Business seems to be the future and the data demonstrates this worrying trend. Already many colleges have started to cut non-useful academic programs in the arts because the corporate elites running education to the ground have decided the liberal arts are meaningless since they don't produce immediate profits or economic value for society, and are therefore wasteful under capitalism. It's all part of the push to see college increasingly as a ROI, students as customers or clients, etc, and it's sickening to see. \n\nI'm not exactly sure what to do at this point, as an art school grad turned teacher who was initially motivated by passion rather than money regarding careers, but am starting to more rationally think that I should cut my losses and aim for the $$$ for the sake of financial stability. Education is facing a crisis of unprecedented proportions and I'm scared for how the future may turn out.",

I took a DATASCI course (Intro to Machine learning) as one of my technical electives thinking that things would be okay. I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG... It is a very hard course with the students being a combination of undergrads and graduate students. It also was the first time this course was ever taught at my institution and the first time the prof has ever taught the course.\n\nLong story short, the prof was completely terrible. The course was structured as follows, 9 assignments, a midterm and final. To pass the course, midterm + final &gt;= 50%. When I say this professor was horrible, he is absolutely the worse. Assignments were returned back to students with barely any feedback and graded strictly by the TA's. The midterm was a complete disaster and the professor himself acknowledged this, curving everyones mark to accommodate the failing average. Technically speaking, I failed the course with a 55% taking in the assignments midterm and final. However, because of the exam component requirement, I failed the course with a 49%....\n\nNot only this, but back in October we had received news from relatives back back home relating to my dads side. His mom was in a serious medical condition so we immediately booked a flight for once my final exams were over (December 22nd). This news obviously affected me a negative way as I was really close to her. My father was also really mad at me that I couldn't fly out sooner than December because of school, but that's not really my fault and so the depression I felt was even worse. The constant arguments I'd get into with my dad, his constant yelling became so bad I didn't know what to do at one point.\n\nAnyways, I still tried my best to carry through with the rest of the semester, still completing all my labs and assignments on time, and ended up eventually passing my other 5 courses. It's just this one course that I ended up failing. Mind you this is my last year of university, so my parents are also expecting me to graduate within this academic school year. Imaging telling my dad that might not be a possibility...\n\nDo you guy's think I have grounds for an academic appeal of my final grade? I am going to write an official letter but don't know which direction I should head in. Thanks in advanced!",

I know it is still early days (kind of), but I just feel like such an idiot all the time. I present what I've been working on which is 100% independent (- I feel like I'm doing a PhD again in that I have several supervisors but no peers on the project) to my team and leave feeling like I haven't done anything of value. The feedback I've had since I've started has been positive but I just can't get it out of my head that they're being kind because in some capacity they can sense I'm anxious/in my head about these things. I haven't been the best employee if I am honest with myself -- I can be avoidant because I feel like I haven't achieved enough, and I had a downward spiral a few months ago and was definitely not doing my full working week for at least a month. Knowing this it's also crazy to me that they are saying they are happy with my progress!\n\nAnyway - a lot of this comes from \"imposter syndrome\" -- yeah technically I am qualified, but I certainly don't feel it. Sometimes I read papers explaining things I should know like the back of my hand and I feel like I'm reading a foreign language. I'm surrounded by the smartest people I've ever met - and I'm yet to meet someone who I've thought \"man this person doesn't know what they're on about\" which I absolutely have felt in the past. I think I've reached my limit! I'm not smart enough for this, I'm not career driven enough to succeed in academia. I actually think I am too much of the navel-gazing variety to succeed in anything, and that's kind of stupid in itself because success to me is being happy, and I certainly don't feel that. I love the area I'm working on, it's super interesting and challenging but I just can't seem to separate my emotions.\n\nHave you felt this? Was there a point when things clicked into place and you felt comfortable in this position where it feels like your intellect is completely exposed with nowhere to hide? What has helped? I have had smallish conversations around this with one of my supervisors but this guy is a downright genius, and I'm just... lost.

I just have a question on the role of co-advisor/co-supervisor. \n\nI have a co-advisor who's a young academic (who I didn't pick but was added to my supervision) and who I have the \"honour\" of being her first phd student. I find her role to be extremely passive ie. editing typos in my draft, participating in meetings with my supervisor but not contributing much technical information. \n\nThere has been a couple of instances where she took her place when I felt like she shouldn't have and shown that she's been difficult to work with. For example, she was insistent that she was right about paperwork procedures to get a visa for another country (for which I would go on a visit), refusing my explanations when the hosting institution told me the right way to get a visa. That cost me few weeks extra of my time, delays etc which she never once apologized for. \n\nHer attitude towards my supervision has been to do the very bare minimum (correct typos) and I am not benefitting much from her from knowledge point of view. \n\nI am thinking if most co-supervisors or does it differ from institution to institution? I have been wanting to remove her but want to do so as most delicately as possible. But first, I'd like to know if I am unreasonable in my expectations towards a co-supervisor. If it is, any suggestions on how to bring this up delicately to my supervisor would be appreciated as well. \n\nThank you!",

        "text": "Not 100% sure if this is the right place to ask, but I thought it'd be best to get an academic perspective on this.\n\nI'm currently a senior undergrad in the US attempting to pick between domestic PhD programs. My past research was in atomic quantum information, and I'm lucky enough to have two amazing offers in my hand (one from the electrical engineering department of a T3 school, and another from the physics department of another T3 school). However, I'm a little worried; from what I've heard (at least on here), getting into academia is an uphill climb to say the least. In addition, if I want to continue with my current research focus on atomic physics and quantum control, I worry that I won't be able to find a decently well-paying job in case academia doesn't work out, as I don't know of any atomic physics careers outside of a handful of national labs.\n\nAs such, I'm faced with a dilemma. If I accept the second offer and do my PhD in physics, I could see myself being the most fulfilled with the work I'm doing, as I'd be continuing with my interests in atomic physics and quantum control. On the flip side, I'm really worried about backup job prospects if I do accept the physics offer. However, if I work at the other institution's electrical engineering department, I'd be working in an almost entirely new field that I have very little experience in (either superconducting quantum engineering or solid-state photonics), but I can almost guarantee that I'd be able to find a backup career in case academia doesn't work out.\n\nI'm not sure what I need to think about when I make this decision. I want to make sure I have a somewhat stable career after my PhD, but at the same time, I feel like I'd have to re-learn so much if I switch from atomic physics. I'd really appreciate some insight into this, as I'm genuinely not sure about what I should do.",

My major is engineering physics, currently first year with an apprenticeship in robotics/automation and a 4.0. My first degree was in environmental biology, with 1 year statistical research and a 3.2. I also have some years of work experience in chemical/medical manufacturing from after the first degree. \n\nMy primary interest and motivation for returning to school is plasma physics. After that, I am interested in electrical engineering, especially communications/signals. I have some minimal interest in biomaterials and biophysics. \n\n\nI'm not worried about getting into a PhD in either specialty. Or, well, I *am* but less than how worried I am about what I will do *after* the PhD-- by earliest estimates, I'll graduate at 41. \n\n\nFear of age discrimination in faculty hiring makes me very hesitant to pursue grad school in physics, since it's already so competitive. \n\n\nElectrical engineering seems a much safer bet, especially because I can more easily switch to industry and it seems more friendly to nontrad students, but if age discrimination is very prevalent, I wonder if I should pick a third option... \n\n\nI have been accepted to a biology master's at a top Italian university, with a focus on biophysics and quantitative studies. This could let me become a sort-of-almost-physicist, especially if I supplement with some extra undergrad coursework. I'd still get my PhD around 38, so very late, but I'd still technically be in my 30s and my CV would read as far more cohesive. \n\n\nIm just really having trouble deciding if those advantages make it worth it to study something I'm not that interested in. Like, it wouldn't be *hell*, and I could probably make it my own if I tried.  I don't want to turn down a very good opportunity all because of silly pipe dreams. But I also don't want to give up on my actual dream before I've even tried just because of unfounded anxieties. \n\n\nWhat would you do in my position? Is age discrimination common enough I'd face serious barriers after leaving a PhD? Is it best to just do my best with what I have, rather than trying to start over? \n\n\n**Please let me know your country** or at least if you're American or not. I think age discrimination is less common in the US than the EU, and I want to get a realistic idea of the risks and challenges over there.",

I am currently getting my master's in public administration. My undergrad school is ranked much better than my master's, but my master's is affordable and I am walking away debt free. When deciding to do the MPA i thought it would be a terminal degree for me, but now that i am back in school and learning amazing things I have really been considering getting a PhD in political science. A couple of my professors have really encouraged me to do so as well as. A lot of my course work is more closely aligned with a political science degree. I am currently waiting to hear back if one of my abstract's has been accepted at APSA. My research interests revolve around political economy and social capital. I was feeling really optimistic about pursuing a PhD, but am so unsure now. Keep in my mind, although I would love to get into a top PhD program it is not the end of the world if I don't. My main dream with a PhD would be teaching like most people. That being said, I would be so content teaching at a CSU or just state school. Like I am not really interested in brand names and \"top universities\" for teaching, coming from a rural area I would love to give back to those communities and avoid the snobbery of top places (no offense lol). So my questions are...\n\n1. Do i have a better chance of landing a professor job if my goals aren't working for a top university?\n2. What the actual f\\*ck can you even do with a political science PhD if you don't go into academia?\n3. If you have an MPA, what are jobs you found in the field that aren't miserable desk jobs?\n\nThank you so much for reading this and helping me! I am not looking for hopeful answers, just realistic. No one in my life or family has gotten a PhD so I am extremely new to this entire process and would love some help.",

My responsibilities include grading papers with other RAs and conducting office hours to help students with assignments.\n\nMy colleague, who had already done this work in the previous semester, was supposed to guide me and give me pointers and advice. One day, they messaged me and said that students are complaining that I'm unable to help them during my office hours. My colleague is known for giving out answers and violating academic integrity, and a lot of students show up to their office hours for this reason. In contrast, I prefer to give hints and help students understand the concepts on their own.\n\nMy colleague suggested that it's only a matter of time before the students complain to the professor, and they offered to take over my office hours. In exchange, I would take on some of their harder responsibilities, which were evenly split among us. However, I'm confident that I'm helping the students well during my office hours. Students have expressed their gratitude for my patience and the time I spend in helping them understand the concepts.\n\nI refused to switch responsibilities, and instead suggested that students can shoot me an email or speak to the professor directly if they have concerns. I believe that my colleague is shirking their responsibilities and trying to load them on me. I'm not sure if I should talk to the professor about this, as I have a weird feeling that my colleague might defend their claims.\nCan you please help me with some advice on how to handle this situation?\n\nTL;DR : My colleague, who's supposed to guide me as a Research Assistant, says students are complaining that I'm not helpful during office hours.

Something I’ve noticed is that a lot of these positions (entry-level research coordinator / assistant jobs) expect SO much. Years of research experience, coding experience, honors thesis, etc. Aren’t these positions meant to be stepping stones for preparation for graduate school in a way? So many people recommend the best way to make yourself a competitive applicant for PhD programs is to work in these research positions. But how is that fair if the bar is set so high for them? I can’t help but empathize for people who didn’t go to research universities or had external factors preventing them from obtaining undergrad research.",

I realize though since that the pre-registered study will be available to public, what is preventing other, bigger research labs from taking the idea and design, finishing the study quicker, and publishing it? Maybe I'm overlooking some steps in this process, but curious about what others think.",
