Then, on a whim, I decided to put on one of those long ambient noise compilations on YouTube. It was the sound of a fireplace crackling and rain thudding outside. It didn‚Äôt work; it was more distracting than helpful. So I decided as a last resort to just put on some random classical music. At first, the music was distracting as well, but then I found that I couldn‚Äôt read without it! I try to pick slow and simple arrangements and turn them down a bit. The music becomes so immersive for the story! So many books go well with classical music, and even when a book doesn‚Äôt fit the aesthetic of classical music, the sounds still help me concentrate tremendously! Reading books like The Count of Monte Cristo with classical tidings in your ear is a whole new experience‚Ä¶\n\nSo, I‚Äôve made this post to recommend you to at least try reading with classical music playing! It‚Äôs immersive and wonderful!",

Fadell is widely recognized as the \"Father of the iPod,\" and his experiences in creating game-changing products such as the iPod and the Nest Thermostat serve as the backdrop for this book.\n\nThe central theme of the book is the importance of designing products with a human-centered approach. Fadell emphasizes the need to focus on solving real problems for real people and to avoid being distracted by technology for technology's sake. He argues that this approach is essential for creating products that are both successful and meaningful.\n\nOne of the key strengths of the book is its accessibility. Fadell's writing style is engaging and easy to understand, making complex concepts accessible to readers with varying levels of expertise. The book is also filled with anecdotes and real-life examples that illustrate Fadell's points, which makes the reading experience more enjoyable and memorable.\n\nAnother strength of the book is the practical advice it offers. Fadell provides a clear framework for product development, outlining the key steps that are required to create successful products. He also shares insights into the importance of prototyping, testing, and iteration, and how these processes can help to refine a product and make it more effective.\n\nOverall, \"Build\" is an excellent book that offers valuable insights into the world of product development and innovation. Whether you are an entrepreneur, a product manager, or simply someone who is interested in the creative process, this book is well worth reading. Fadell's unorthodox approach to product development is refreshing and thought-provoking, and his practical advice is actionable and valuable. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about what it takes to create products that are worth making.",

Can't remember). I think her life wasn't that great there. She then meets a friend who's a boy (I think?) and they stowed away on a boat (this is my strongest memory of the book). While there, she stole some hot chips from the chef.\n\nThe book also described either where she was from, or where she ended up in, as bucolic. This word stuck with me as it isn't the most common world used in YA fiction.\n\nRecently got very curious to find out the book's title.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Raise your hand if you‚Äôre a first born üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è \nThe strength it takes to be the oldest is a special strength.  Regardless if you grew up rich or poor, good or bad, with one parent, two parents, or even no parents. Being the oldest is a superpower and a curse all at the same time. I‚Äôm the oldest. Have always been and always will be. While I‚Äôm a mom, a daughter, a worker, even as my own person, being the oldest has defined me. It‚Äôs made me be a leader my whole life. I don‚Äôt know how else to be besides in charge. I grew in between the one parent/two parent category. Believe me when I say I didn‚Äôt have the worst life. Within all the bad, there was so much good. And given the terms of the bad, that good was so, SO good. I‚Äôll always give my parents that credit. My dad worked. A lot. He was typically gone from home, especially as we got older and more of us came. Bills increased and my mom started doing less and less. He was angry most of the time. Understandably. I personally don‚Äôt know how he wasn‚Äôt angrier. Of course I didn‚Äôt realize any of this at the time and I thought he was just this terrible man. I thought I understood why my mom did what she did. She wasn‚Äôt even my mom. More like a best friend. It might not sound bad. But if you had a best friend rather than a mom, you probably know exactly what I mean. It wasn‚Äôt always that way though. It was like the weirdest transition. From the jump she was overprotective. Didn‚Äôt let me paint my nails or have any type of make up, no revealing clothing. I was in middle school and still couldn‚Äôt go to the movies with my friends and no parents. She worked in the beginning. Or kind of worked I guess. My dad always worked but he was home more at this time. We had a big 7 bedroom house. Three living rooms, a gigantic kitchen. But while my mom was working, she was cheating. All the time. She didn‚Äôt even go to work most of the time. When she did, she would get paid and buy us new clothes, hiding it from everyone else. At the time, it was nice. But it was just to cover up the fact that we didn‚Äôt have a bath most of the time or brush our teeth, get our hair cut or even brush it. Or the fact that we didn‚Äôt go to school faithfully and when we did we weren‚Äôt really there. I was young, just starting out in school. A mess. A literal mess. You know the kid who has the dirty hair and old clothes? Quiet but not bullied. That was me. I didn‚Äôt do my homework or read books, absolutely no extra activities. When it got serious and I started getting in trouble, instead of my mom helping me, she just did my homework and I wrote over it in my own handwriting. I picked and chose when I wanted to go to school. She‚Äôd wake up in the morning and realize I was still there and be cool with it. We‚Äôd enjoy our day somehow. Little did I know, this was only going to set me up for failure.  And that‚Äôs exactly what I did.  Failed my way through school. Eventually my mom stopped working and was a stay at home ‚Äúmom‚Äù. But she didn‚Äôt do the stuff that most moms do. I didn‚Äôt hate her at this point. Probably because I loved her so much that I didn‚Äôt realize she was the root of all our problems. It was like we had no structure. We didn‚Äôt have our mom telling or showing us the normal things parents do.  We lived an absolute crazy life and somehow managed to hide it all from my dad. He paid the bills while we lived without him. We were trained to answer his questions carefully and always had a story in the bag incase we needed it. It was like a group rehearsal every time he came home. ‚ÄúWhen dad asks who was here, what do we say?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat about where this came from?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd one more time, who exactly is Daniel and how do we know him?‚Äù We thought we understood. She didn‚Äôt tuck us in at night or paint our nails. We never ate home cooked meals or bake cookies, not because of her at least. We didn‚Äôt go on trips or celebrate our birthdays. At times we weren‚Äôt even eating and I was stealing food and clothes. But we loved her. We were still somehow happy.  I was getting molested my entire life and still somehow didn‚Äôt want to die. Not always at least. There was times when I was so ready. Especially when my mom let it happen. Or when I was realizing how fucked up our life actually was. I ended up hating everyone and everything. There wasn‚Äôt any light at the end of the tunnel or some super hero that was going to come save my day. I spiraled and was just an ‚Äúevil child‚Äù as my mom would call me. She‚Äôd always ask why I was so angry and how I could have that much hate in me, and what she ever did that made everything so bad. I feel like I got better with her always saying that. Just the constant reminder that my mom truly didn‚Äôt see what was wrong made me less hateful. It was like there was no reason in being so angry because she never saw the wrong in what she did, therefore it would never change.  And why in the world would I want to live like that? Angry and hateful.  Do you know how exhausting it is to truly be that angry? Exhausting. Take it from me and don‚Äôt do it. I learned how to push it all to the side and smile again. I just took my mom for who she was. &amp;I say push to the side because that‚Äôs what I did. Never worked through it or addressed anything. Just simply pretended it didn‚Äôt happen. There are always things to be grateful for. The fact that we were sleeping in a house, had water and electricity. Eachother. I held onto that. My mom never left us. I always joked that if she got a job that she just wouldn‚Äôt come home one day, but it was an actual fear. I didn‚Äôt want her to leave us and she didn‚Äôt. But, that means she brought us along. The things I seen, the situations I‚Äôve been in. We‚Äôre all kinda fucked up, but I have a different story, because I‚Äôm the oldest. \n\n.. more coming soon! Let me know when you‚Äôre ready for it!",

This manga would make John Carpenter nod in approval!\n\nWithin these chapters chronicles the horrific story of the title character, Tomie. Incredibly beautiful with long black hair and just under her left eye a beauty mark. But she is a femme fatale, able to seduce any man quite easily, and she is also immortal.\n\nThe men that she seduces not only become so enamored with her, and would do anything for her, some become frightened of her. And eventually they are driven to murder, with the victim often being Tomie herself. But regardless of how many times she is killed, she always comes back, and the world is never truly rid of her.\n\nThis is a really good piece of manga horror. And also of body horror too, with elements reminiscent of \"The Thing\". Interestingly enough one of the chapters titled \"Painter\" is featured in the Junji Ito collection \"Shiver\". Either way, as a whole or (excuse the pun) in pieces, \"Tomie\" is a great work of horror manga.",

Recently my local library has been the center of controversy, continuing a troubling trend of persons who previously had no interest suddenly becoming vehemently offended that the PUBLIC library had a wide selection of genres. Their current strategy is to label or segregate LGBTQ books. This is a goal that is, to their credit, attainable. The group claims to not to be in favor of discrimination, but their work and words suggest otherwise. Does anyone in this group have any experience in fending off these groups?",

Never mind that it‚Äôs not even medically accurate. It‚Äôs precisely this kind of BS that circumscribed women ‚Äî forever, generally, and in the 19th century particularly. The literary (and actual) punishment of women for showing even the slightest initiative and desire is execrable. \nI had heard forever about Daisy Miller being a great novella with very well drawn characters. I was glad to finally have a chance to sit down and read the thing straight through. I was bitterly disappointed by this sexist BS.",
