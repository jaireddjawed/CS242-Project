        "text": "Hello everyone! I'm an electrician and instrumentation guy by day and electronics engineering hobbyist and student by night (eventually will get my PhD). I have been researching a few projects to keep me busy (and help me to solidify the theory I learn) in my spare time and I stumbled across the Marx Generator after watching a DefCon talk about injecting pulses into digital devices.  \n  \nSo I've been researching Marx Generators and I've hit a few snags, so here is what I need to know.  \n  \n* First, capacitor cost. Since these things cost so much money and I will need a decent number of them, what is a reliable source for some ceramic high voltage caps? I've been looking at 40kV ceramic doorknobs, am I barking up the right tree?  \n  \n* Calculating how much x-rays a 1MV arc will give off. How can I calculate this? I want to know if I should invest in lead glass or not.  \n  \n* Electrodes. I have an idea of using copper carriage bolts (sized correctly) as electrodes but I feel there should be far better options for what I need. Any good sources for proper electrodes?  \n  \n* Sulfur hexaflouride vs a dielectric oil. Which is better for what I want to do.  \n  \nAny tips would be helpful! I plan on designing this thing 50 times before I invest one cent into its construction.",

Connect the bulb and the speaker to a micro-controller.\n2. Connect the phone to the micro-controller via usb. \n3. Write an app to communicate the data from the phone to the micro-controller and depending upon the action taken within the app the microcontroller would either light up the bulb or play the music.\n4. The micro-controller should be able to provide power to the phone\n\nTo get the above thing working, I saw that microcontroller that I am using should be build around the Android open accessory protocol to be able to communicate with the phone and vice versa. There are few options in the market which are buiild with the Android open accessory protocol such as Arduino Mega 2560 ADK, sparkfun IOIO and few other. but the problem is these microcontrollers are bit costly and I am thinking of building around 100-400 of such for a student group and may be more later.

I need to make a decision soon on which offer to accept and would greatly appreciate any advice regarding work-life balance, company culture, team experience to learn from, job security, project exposure, and living considerations (Portland vs. San Jose vs. San Diego). For people who already work at these companies, how was your experiences so far and what you think is the best choice for a new grad? \n\nHere are some of my concerns that I have heard by word of mouth which may or not be accurate:\n\n1.\tI was warned that the work culture at AAPL is much more aggressive and secretive compared to QCOM and INTC which leads to lots of people burning out after several years and ultimately changing companies. This includes the much longer work hours and pressure to out compete other groups. On the other hand QCOM and INTC seems to treat their engineers quite well resulting in people happily staying there for their entire careers (until they get laid off).\n\n2.\tQCOM seems to be the most experienced out of the three in my specific area so I would assume I can learn the most from them and be employable at other places afterwards. Intel also seems to have a solid team but somehow still underperforms QCOM. AAPL seems to have only entered this area several years ago making them the least experienced but has attracted senior talent from other companies (Ex Broadcom, Mediatek etc.).\n\n3.\tWhich is safer in terms of job stability in the future? It seems even these large companies can go under fast even if they are so well established (ex. Broadcom). Both INTC and QCOM had a round of layoffs last year. This is concerning especially when considering the current QCOM vs. APPL lawsuits.\n\n4.\tIn terms of salary, AAPL &gt; QCOM &gt; INTC. However cost of living is the other way around. /shrug\n\n5.\tI have not lived in either Portland, San Jose or San Diego and have no clue which is better assuming there is even time to enjoy it. My friends that do live in San Diego and Portland both love it, while my friends in San Jose just complain about the housing prices. However, I have been advised that Silicon Valley is the place to be just to be in centre of things with many more opportunities.\n\nThanks!",

Band-pass filter was calculated with AADE Filter Design, which is provided below.\n\nA quick overview:\n\n-The system is a one way transmitter-receiver pair (data can only go in one direction)\n\n-Operates in the CB band of 27 MHz\n\n-OOK modulation is used to encode the carrier with data\n\n-Data transfer rate was tested up to 9600 baud (most likely can run up to 256000 baud, band-pass filter has BW of 5 MHz)\n\n-Modulated power complies with FCC, such that you do not need a licensed to operate\n\n-A boost converter allows for system mobility, needing only +5V 1A supply. (USB 3.0)\n\n-TRF design (yes I know regenerative would have been better)\n\n-Range tested up to 100 ft. \n\n\nA mistake exist on the paper in the transmitter/receiver schematic where no EMI caps are shown. This is not the case, standard power supply filtering was applied with 5 capacitors increasing in magnitude. A mistake on the final receiver design also exist, an AC grounding cap between every amplification stage should be present. Luckily it did not cause me problems. \nI'm fairly confident other errors exist that escape me right now.\n\nIf you require the microcontroller code just ask. If you use material from my paper for whatever reason, please cite me (I would really appreciate it). I will be blacking out my name in the uploaded document, for citation purposes I'll give it to you.\n\nEnjoy:\nhttps://ufile.io/lws9i\n\nAADE Filter Design:\nhttp://www.dxzone.com/dx17873/aade-filter-design.html\n",

I figured my best bet is being effective at delivering well-specified chips on time, turns out that's what I do.\n\nI am trying to build out my skills on the mixed-signal side of things since that's a weak area for me. So I've also been focusing on the digital verification side of the equation a little bit just to have a better understanding.\n\nat my work we are kind of small so there has been good opportunity to learn a little bit about all of the aspects of chip design. So I have familiarity and design experience with a lot of the more esoteric aspects including ESD design, high voltage applications, quality / lifetime testing, device modeling, weird stuff like latch-up, static EM design, even package design to some extent.

As I see it, the average armature voltage and current are all that really matter from the perspective of the motor...\n\nWe can achieve the same average armature voltages and currents with this \"coast\" mode as with the more popular \"brake\" mode (Q4 -&gt; Q2 conduct during the off time). The major differences that I see are:\n\n1. Coasting during PWM OFF time gives a less linear relation between duty cycle and average current.\n\n2. For most devices, coasting during PWM OFF time will result in higher power dissipation in the H-bridge, since the body diode forward voltage will usually be larger than the voltage drop due to transistor ON resistance (Vf * I &gt; I^2 * Rds).\n\nSo, would you ever use this mode? Why?",

I'm using an Atmel ICE to burn the bootloader (arduino zero bootloader) then was hoping to program using the USB.\nThe ICE burns the bootloader perfectly, everything recognized, no errors or anything, but when I try to plug in using the USB port it doesn't recognize it in any way like nothing was plugged in. But the strange thing is if the ICE is plugged into the PCB without power as well as the USB plugged into the PCB and computer, the computer will display a 'device not recognized'/'port malfunctioned' message, so it is definitely connected correctly to the SAMD21.\n\nThings I've tried:\n- Different USB cables\n- Power cycling the board\n- Using another SAMD21 chip\n- Using another USB port\n- Re-flowing the chip  , USB connector, crystal and everything else\n- Checking the schematic multiple times\n- Checking the PCB for shorts\n- Sufficient power and correct voltages\n- Burning bootloader with Atmel Studio 7 and Arduino IDE\n- Checked SWD header connections are correct\n\nThings in my mind that could be the problem but im not sure about:\n- SAMD21 fuse bit settings\n- Does it need USB drivers? (couldn't find any if it does)\n- Wrong bootloader/bootloader needs customizing?\n\nIf you need any more info let me know and ill do my best to give whats needed.\n\nThis will be my first custom micro-controller PCB so once I've got my head around this I can continue learning and try make something great!\n\nThank you to anyone who helps :)\n\nKind regards,\nHayden.",

        "text": "Hello, sory for long post.\n\nI'm an electrical engineering student looking for career advice.\nLast year, when I was finishing my bachelor, I wanted to get some experience and I got a trial for a student job at a high-tech control company. \nThe selection proces had two stages. The first one was learning linux and their program. The second one was working on a limited project for a customer. If you passed both, you got the job. Since I was doing this in the middle of the summer and the first stage seemed to be going well(I had just passed the hardest part of the first stage),I decided to take the year off (meaning I did not apply for the Masters) and work. \nSoon after, while I was finishing the first stage, my mentor was asked by superiors if I was ready for a project. He replied that he didn't think I was quite ready (I agree I wasn't, since we didn't have any good programming in school) . His superious asked him why then he hasn't let me go, which he proceeded to do the next day.\n\nThat came as a big blow to me, since it seemed like I was doing well, and when I asked my mentor about this, he said that I didn't go properly in depth into the questions they had and that I made small mistakes in the code. He also said that he should have alerted me to this during the  first stage(he admited that he was new to this). I offered to learn their other program properly, but they declined and said to come back after I get some experience.\n\nSo at the end of the summer I was without a job, too late to apply and with damaged confidence. I proceded to attend different job fair, hone my CV and apply for relevant jobs. \n\nI had 2 interviews that went well but nothing came to fruition. \nThat was in December. When January rolled around I saw an offer for PLC sales support in a respectable automation company with acceptable pay. It wasn't what I was looking for, but I thought I could still learn some technical skills. I was wrong. While the people are nice and the schedule is flexible, the job is boring and consists of making offers and orders for customers. I feel like I didn't learn anything and that I wasted my time.\n\nI did participate in two bigger school project on the side from February till June, but now that they're done I feel anxioust that I'm stagnating and that the whole year was a waste of time.\n\nMy question is whether this will reflect badly on my CV?\nDo you think it's better to work less and do some programming and learning on the side (Udacity, Codecademy,..) or to try anc change the job, though it's a bit late?\nAny career advice in general?\n\nTL,DR: Took a year of on the prospect of a student job, rejected in the end, crashed my self-esteem. Tried to get relevant job, ended up in a boring office job with no challenge. Would it be better to work less and learn programming, to try and change jobs or to hold on till the next semester?",

There are some well-known rules for sinusoids (L &lt; lambda/10 or L &lt; lambda/20, depending on who you ask), but I'm not familiar with anything similar for digital signals where some distortion could be acceptable.\n\nSome things I've tried to get estimates, such as:\n\n(1) Combine {BW = f = 0.35 / trise}, and {lambda = c / f}, and {L &lt; lambda/10} to get {L &lt; 4.3 (cm/ns) * trise} for c = c0/2.\n\n(2) Empirically, you can drive a transmission line with an ideal trapezoidal voltage source with any output resistance and get a clean output waveform as long as (a) the transmission line's round-trip delay is less than the source's rise time, and (b) Z0*Cload &lt;&lt; trise. Plugging in {lambda = c / f} gives {L &lt; 7.5 (cm/ns) * trise}, which is less strict than the analog sine wave criterion.\n\nThe empirical result being less strict than the analysis in (1) makes sense, since the highest frequency components could still suffer from transmission line effects while more dominant low frequency components are less bothered by the delay. However, relying on an empirical result is a little risky unless you've experimented enough with it to know that it's true enough to rely on. For example, this doesn't account for other more complex situations, e.g. a trace that forks.\n\nHas anyone looked at this issue before? What was your conclusion on when a digital signal can be treated as electrically short?",

Ultimately, the project will provide:\n\n* VGA video driver\n* Sprite/tile based graphics driver\n* PWM sound driver\n* Serialized input driver\n* Game engine\n* PCB schematic and CAD files\n\nin such a way that a user has everything they need to implement their own arcade game and have a PCB printed to build it on.\n\nThis is a project that spans several EE, CPE, and CS disciplines such as active and passive component circuit design, PCB development and design, video generation, game theory and design, assembly programming, microcontroller interfacing, FPGA development, verilog design, and many more. \n\nA more detailed description can be found in the [JCAP README](https://github.com/cspang1/JCAP/blob/master/README.md).\n*****\n###How do I follow it?\nThe project is being managed via GitHub, and can be found at:\n\n* https://github.com/cspang1/JCAP\n\nThe progress log can be found at:\n\n* https://github.com/cspang1/JCAP/wiki\n\nThe log itself contains a lot of background information that some might find very interesting as well, such as a brief history of arcade games and an analysis of historical video formats. Here are the first handful of logs to get your feet wet on the project:\n\n* [JCAP: JAMMA Custom Arcade Project](https://github.com/cspang1/JCAP/wiki/Home)\n  * [JCAP Log #1: A Little History](https://github.com/cspang1/JCAP/wiki/JCAP-Log-%231:-A-Little-History)\n  * [JCAP Log #2: JAMMA](https://github.com/cspang1/JCAP/wiki/JCAP-Log-%232:-JAMMA)\n  * [JCAP Log #3: Input](https://github.com/cspang1/JCAP/wiki/JCAP-Log-%233:-Input)\n  * [JCAP Log #4: Video](https://github.com/cspang1/JCAP/wiki/JCAP-Log-%234:-Video)\n\n*****\n###Contributing\nAny help will be gladly accepted, and if anyone is interested in contributing to the project,  please read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cspang1/JCAP/wiki#contribution-guidelines). Currently, I would be glad to get in touch with anyone who has experience with developing graphics drivers, either on the software or hardware sides. The graphics system will be tile and sprite based, and will be very similar to the Nintendo Entertainment System's.",

After seeing the work that was done there, I've decided that this is the kind of work I would eventually like to come back to in the future.  \nHowever, 2 things that stood out were that everyone had a higher degree than bachelor's - masters or PhD, and the majority of the people there worked on areas such as computer vision, machine learning, or control systems. On the other hand, I was in the minority that worked on embedded software and a little bit of electronics design, both of which I really enjoyed.\n\nMy question is, what should I focus on during my masters (and possibly PhD if necessary) to raise my chances of eventually working at a place that works on cutting edge robotics? Would I have to start moving more into control systems, computer vision, machine learning etc.?  \nAlso would attempting to go to a US based school for my masters be a good idea?  \nAnd finally would a PhD be necessary? I see many degree programs that offer funding if you are able to gain entry into the masters+PhD program, but none for degree programs that are just masters only.\n\nThanks in advance",

Is it dirty work or are you in an office environment for the majority of the time? Do you work mostly with PLCs and controls engineering? \n2.) How demanding is the job? Are you on call 24/7? Do you work long hours and/or weekends? Is the job physically or mentally exhausting? \n3.) How is job security in a refinery with fluctuating oil prices? \n\nIn summary: What would you say are the main pros and cons of the job?\n\nPersonal note: I finished grad school with my MSc in EE (power focus) about a year ago. I've been working in power at a utility for 1.5 years now, but have become extremely uninterested with my job and the field as a whole. I'm now considering Instrument Engineer jobs at some local oil refineries (SE Texas). However with zero experience I'm not sure how much of a chance I have at getting in. My grad and undergrad GPAs are 3.76 and 3.52. I also have 3 years internship experience in automotive manufacturing for whatever it's worth. But first thing is first - figuring out if it's something I could see myself doing.\n\nThank you for any feedback!",

        "text": "Well like the title states I'm beginning my engineering career, but I honestly don't know where to go or what to do. I recently moved to the west coast and I'm not going to lie, CA is super expensive compared to where I used to live. I went through a long session of job searching, many of which required 1 or 2+ years of experience in very particular fields. One of the interviews I went to (which I thought was a great interview) took 2 hours of my time only to have the guy completely ignore me afterwards. Anyways I was finally able to get 2 job offers, they both start at 15$ an hour because \"I don't have any experience\" but after the probation period I was told I would get a pay increase. Although I'm practically stumped on where each one leads, or if I'm even in the right field. One of them is titled 'Planning Designer I' for a power utility company and the other one is 'Entry Level Solar Technician' for a solar company.\n\nI don't really know what a 'Planning Designer I' does since initially applied for the autoCAD related 'Designer' gig but was then pushed towards 'Planning designer' due to my lack of experience. So maybe someone can shed some light on that. Also when I looked up how much a planning designer usually makes, I got $60k-75k, and when I asked the employer how much would I make after the probation period was over, I never got a real answer. I got the \"it depends on how much work you take on\" answer and while that's all fine and dandy, I don't think it's much to ask for a REAL number, is it? Because I don't want to be taken advantage of and get paid like a whole 10$ less than what I'm suppose to make. When I spoke to the 'Entry Level Solar Technician' employer he told me their \"entry level technicians start $15 but once I can be on my on I can start from $25-30 and hour, but the sky is the limit from there.\" Which I really appreciate since he gave me numbers to calculate my living expenses in the future. But I don't know where this job can really lead, because I don't think that I want to be a solar maintenance technician for the rest of my life.\n\nWhat kills me is how I finished 4 years of schooling yet everyone wants \"experience\" in a very strict field, yet my nurse friend got her degree in 3 years and starts out at $36/hr with zero experience on her first interview?!!?? With all sorts of benefits I might add! I'm not looking for something easy or an easy ride. I would like to think that I can be a hard worker especially once I get the hang of things. I'm honestly just looking for something that I can have a comfortable future in with good pay. Also I'm hoping to use any experience I gain from whatever job that I take in the future. So if anyone can give out advice or guide me on what I should do, I greatly appreciate it, you're honestly saving my life. Thank you in advance!",

I have parts coming from China and am about to order a soldering station, complete with air as I ultimately want to get into PCBs/SMD.\n\nAs it stands right now, I can't really remember (for example) how to \"debounce\" button-presses, why I'd want to use pull-up/-down resistors, and how to shield electronics (I do remember that four diodes can make a nice bridge-rectifier for power, but that's about it).\n\n**What is the fastest way to go from, \"I knew at one time but have forgotten\" to, \"aha, I could easily rebuild this circuit to be lower-power/safer/more reliable\" with a few months committed effort?** Sadly, my DL coursework didn't have a book to speak of and I've long-since lost the notes. \n\nAlso, software: I used PSpice before and remember being pretty good at that--I liked being able to test ideal circuits prior to breadboarding. I have a few pieces of software I'm playing with now, and know that I'll have to also use a PCB tool (e.g. Eagle, Fritzen, etc.) are there any that stand head and shoulders for the hobbyist? I am especially interested in auto-routing and probing/analyzing connections, as I don't have an O-scope for advanced analysis.\n\nLots of content here, I realize. I've looked at the rules and this isn't homework (I'm looking to ultimately make and sell completed PCBs and enclosures), not tech support, and I only mention PSpice because that's what I used in undergrad and Eagle because it seems ubiquitous. And Fritzen because it's interesting/free.

I did a grade substitution for a class I had failed in Fall, but my advisor said that it won't show up until after this Summer semester is over. Right now I'm taking 9 hours and if I get a 4.0 GPA during this term my GPA will be @ 3.34. So should I wait until my GPA is completely up to date to start applying, or should I just start ASAP?",

Please forgive me if I am using the wrong wording as I am still learning the correct verbage.\n\nI would like to have 6 objects with their own respective RFID tags, when placed on the correct reader (all 6 in the \"correct\" order) it will trigger a new event (trigger a latch, to open a small compartment).\n\nThe best way I can try to explain it is I have object A B C D E F, these objects are to be placed in the correct order, in this example alphabeticaly, and then it will trigger a small latch.\n\nHow would I achieve this?  Multiple RFID readers that will all remain off by default then turn on once the previous RFID has been read?  I am looking to purchase what's necessary to make this happen.  I'm not sure and would GREATLY appreciate your help.  Thank you so much!\n\nEdit: Spelling",

(You can just apply to our HR department if you want, but it will then have to go through the usual HR machinery, whereas I can answer questions, and if I see a promising candidate, I can help fast-track things.)  \nWhile the posted job description is reasonably accurate, I'm going to post my version of the requirements, because you have to read between the lines for these things, \nand that tends to sometimes attract the wrong resumes. Again, take this with a grain of salt because I'm not the one in charge. (edit: and because I'm not a manager and don't work for HR, I will have to refer you to them for certain questions regarding benefits + qualifications.)\n\nMust-haves:\n\n- At least BSEE with 3+ years work experience in engineering\n- Good problem-solving skills and ability to learn quickly\n- Good common sense and decision-making skills\n- Good communication / documentation skills (we frequently work on research reports and software documentation)\n- Ability to take complex details and create a clear and concise summary\n- Experience in C on embedded systems (something more than just creating a flashing LED)\n- Basic understanding of digital signal processing and control theory -- you need to know what a Bode plot is, what a Z-transform is, and why they matter\n- Basic understanding of circuit design -- you should at least be able to read the [MCLV2](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/DS-52080a.pdf) schematic and understand most of it\n- Some knowledge of good programming practices, which is a vague term, but we know it when we see it. You will need to recognize certain \"code smells\" and ensure C code is readable and maintainable,\n  while still executing quickly.\n- Interest in living and working in the Chandler, AZ area -- which is a great place to live and work, although very hot in the summer months.\n\nBonus points: familiarity with any of the following, although honestly the software areas are probably more important\n\n- Some knowledge of motor control theory, including\n  - the PMSM motor model\n  - field-oriented control\n  - flux weakening\n  - sensorless estimators\n- Equipment and techniques for motor control testing (dynamometers, torque sensors, current probes, batteries, data acquisition systems, etc.)\n- Circuit design in areas such as power electronics, embedded systems, and signal processing\n- Tolerance analysis\n- MATLAB and Simulink for simulation of motor control algorithms\n- Python, along the lines of\n  - scientific computing: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, IPython Notebook, pandas, etc.\n  - standard \"glue\" Python: libraries such as `re`, `os`, `subprocess`, `argparse`, `logging`, etc.\n- Embedded processor assembly and an understanding of the compiler's output and how to bend it to your will\n- Fixed-point numerical programming in C\n- Peculiarities of the C language (undefined behavior, type-punning, proper use of const and volatile, etc.)\n\nIf hired, you would be working in a tight-knit team on continued development of a motor control firmware codebase used to support many different motors; \nwe have to think a bit more generally than specific customers working on specific hardware. The ideal candidate is someone who can learn quickly\nfrom senior staff and become a valuable technical contributor, working independently.",
