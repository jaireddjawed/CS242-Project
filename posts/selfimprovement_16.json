        "text": "Long story short I was never like this in my life. Never had any friends. I went trough some heavy stuff with a big smile on my face. I was beaten up on regular basis by my father. He could never break me. I managed to graduate from uni in time with full blown ADHD, unmedicated. I just managed to do it with pure willpower and lots of tears and suffering. ( 3rd world country, get meds if yall can guys )\n\nNow I'm 24 and I can barely function. Everything I do, I always have to do it with friends. Programming stuff, gaming ... Hell I even waste job opportunities, because I can't stand the thought of doing anything alone. \n\nI recently started getting really anxious if they are not around. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I depend on them in any way. If anything they mostly depend on me, since I'm the most stable one financially and academically. I am the one that starts all of the projects, and stuff like that. I am the one that sees their potential and tries to help them in any way I can. I kinda noticed that when I need anything bigger then for example a pick up, they just kinda disappear. And if they need anything , well I'd go to the top of Mt. Everest do get it .  To clarify, example : we all decide to do something together and I end up being the only one trying or doing it at all.  There were the instances too of me **begging** them to help me with something. Showing my most vulnerable side, and the worst part is that these friends would **PROMISE** to help, and disappear when the time for help comes.  But I could write a whole book about their \"being there\" and broken promises. Hell I wanted to start a company with these people !!! Imagine if I went trough with it...\n\nHow do I even break free ? I want to leave them behind in a way. I want to not be so attached that I can barely function. I want to be able to go around alone like I used to. I don't want to be the 24/7 idea and advice generator for people who never were there for me when the **REAL** stuff happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**One more thing : I hope I don't sound bratty and like I expect people to do stuff for me like I would for them. I'm just looking for advice on how to be better me. Me who can go to gym, or to take a walk without \"begging\" anyone to go with me...**",

I’ll always respect your space, but as these months have gone by, it felt like a sad attempt to cut me out without actually saying it. Your words gave no closure. I still love you and your beautiful daughter. Everything I do reminds me of you. \n\nI hate that I love you as much as I do. Your smile, eyes, freckles, hair, body, soul, and energy are what my soul longs for. I miss hearing your laugh. I miss feeling the touch of your hand. The taste of your lips. I miss seeing you be yourself around me, not needing to put up some form of wall. I miss the way my heart would be so full when I saw your name come across my phone. I miss how you made me feel. I felt, for once in my life, good about myself. You make my heart and mind feel full. \n\nI feel betrayed. You looked me in the eyes and told me you loved me, then kissed me. The kiss of Judas. I am full of rage and anger. For letting myself fall again. I remained single for 7 years, and after you, I’m not doing that to myself again. Im only getting older, and as a 27 year old male, it’ll only get harder to find love. Maybe it just isn’t for me. A quote I saw kind of hit home. “I already met the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.. but I had a debt with karma and it came time to pay up.”. I know I wasn’t the best person in my past, but this is just cruel. I think I’m done guys. The love thing isn’t cut out for me. Im too damaged. \n\nSo here’s to letting go:\nLetting go of you. \nLetting go of our memories. \nLetting go of the love I feel for you. \nLetting go of the plans we had. \nLetting go of the pain. \nLetting go of the sadness and fear. \nLetting go of love. \nLetting go of you. \n\nI hope we meet again in another lifetime. I know my soul will find you again. Im sure I have loved you for a million lifetimes. I know I will love you for a million more. “For you, anything”. \n\n\nSince this has all happened, I’ve been desperately trying to change myself for myself and nobody else. To work on my flaws, and I know I have quite a few. Maybe someday, love will come around. For now, that’s not an option. I’ll work on all the other aspects of who I am first and foremost. \n\nThank you for letting me rant.",

I have a great support group at home and even better so at work. \n\nI definitely need to have some time alone to discover myself, regain a sense of identity, figure out what i want out of life and how am i going to get it, \nOr really, just to wake up/ become aware.\n\nHowever I’m met with old demons, I spend a lot of time trying to learn about myself, I take notes, listen to podcasts, do the therapy homework, write everything down when i have time. But i don’t think its good for me to be consumed in self improvement or for it to be my only priority. Im a sharer and often explain things out loud or discuss them to process them, and so people are tired of hearing me talk about this all the time, i need a hobby, or something to focus on that i can be equally interested in so that i don’t burn myself out “spinning my wheels” as they say. I guess im just curious to see what others say.\n\nIf i enjoy workshopping and planning on the future, and always discussing goals and ideas of life planning, am i really wasting my time if i am also not ready to take on these challenges or goals? Im occupying my brain with what i want to accomplish and learning it to the best of my ability. Or Is it all really just mental masturbation? How do i redirect my attention to something that is still growth oriented without losing this sense of personal discovery. Because quite frankly not many things happen at my job and i have a lot of time to just think and entertain myself with whatever excites me. So if others are worried that i could get too wrapped up into this, what do i do instead?",

        "text": " I realized today that I don't handle emergencies or surprise situations well, I start trembling and can't think or speak straight. My nerves will get the better of me. Is this something that can be trained or conditioned out? How does the military or emergency response handle this? I would like to learn how to stay calm, and collected, and not freeze up.\n\n**Example/Storytime:**  \nI was showering at the gym today, minding my own business, when all of a sudden a guy roughly the same height as I ripped open my shower curtain. I was caught by surprise, didn't respond, and just stared at him. I was 100% expecting him to apologize for the mistake but he didn't apologize, instead, he started yelling. This is when I froze up, my heart started pounding, couldn't think or speak clearly, everything was happening so fast. I do remember our dialogue vividly though:\n\n* Guy: \"DO YOU SEE THOSE PANTS ON THE FLOOR!?\" (pointing to a black pile of clothes in the far corner)\n* Me: ...\n* Guy: \"DO YOU SEE THOSE PANTS ON THE FLOOR!?\"\n* Me: ...\n* Guy: \"I SAID DO YOU SEE THOSE PANTS ON THE FLOOR!?\"\n* Me: (croaked) \"...what about them?\"\n* Guy: \"WHAT DID I JUST SAY?! I ASKED YOU 2 TIMES. DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?\"\n* Me: (louder) \"What about them?\"\n* Guy: \"DID YOU THROW THEM ON THE FLOOR?\"\n* Me: \"No.\"\n* Guy: \"DID YOU THROW THEM ON THE FLOOR?\"\n* Me: \"No. I did not.\" (I really didn't, it was already on the floor when I got in the shower.)\n* Guy: (Picks up clothes, storms off angrily)\n* Me: (Closed curtain and continues washing myself like a wet rat.)\n\nI keep thinking about this exchange, feel like a wimp for not punching him in the face or even yelling at him at least. Something. But I did nothing. Just took it. It bothers me. I have a few years of boxing and muay thai training (nothing crazy and it's been a few years) and sparred quite a lot during that time, but it was all useless because I just stood there like a dumbass. I did clean up quickly, talked to the gym manager, and pointed him out in hopes of getting him banned like a Karen. Ugh, so disappointed in myself. How can I improve in this area?",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nThis post will be pretty long so I will divide it in multiple parts so you can take a break whenever.\n\n**1. Friendship problem and the reason for it**\n\nI've destroyed many friendships and relationships. I used to be in a friend group of about 8 people. We were not angels but we would be there for each others. I was always depressed(not diagnosed but I'm guessing that I was) since 2017 due to my first gf cheating on me after 2 years. Instead of opening up or seeking therapy, I decided to continue being the class and friend clown. Used to dress up as an unicorn in high school to make people laugh. This lasted till 2020 and decided to work on myself. I got a gf in summer 2019 but she cheated on me on the same day of my grandpa's funeral. Now, all of this sadness lasted till 2020. So 3-4 years in total. I got myself an amazing gf(now ex) and realized that I had issues, a lot. Covid lockdown was an opportunity for growth and I took. Everything went so well. Until... my parents got divorced, in the end of 2020, because that broke everyone. My dad became angrier and more anxious. My brother got a personality disorder and I got severe OCD. i'm not going to go in details of my OCD, but I let it ruin my life instead of taking actions like a \"man\"(man meaning a mature person. You can be a mature woman or man, it doesn't matter. It's just a \"saying\"). I pushed my friends and expected them to save me not knowing that was immature. So yeah, I recently contacted them to apologize but it's been so long that our connections got lost. They don't know how to feel about our \"friendship\" because I destroyed it. That's fine, because that is called \"Consequences of my actions\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. Relationship problem and the reason for it**\n\nMet my ex in 2019 and started dating her in the same year. We broke up in august 2022 due to my immaturity with ocd. Of course, she wasn't the most supportive and got toxic during the end but I can't blame her. Dealing with someone with problems and no communication(also her) skills can push someone's limit. I started working myself in the begining of covid lockdown and things went really great with her. Like said previously, I got OCD and that completely changed the dynamics of our relationship. I would always come late to dates due to my 1-2 hours ocd compulsions, I would rarely smile, laugh, care, would push her feelings ,etc. I didn't know what I had but I could've asked for help. Shit got really bad... to a point where she didn't want me in her life by saying \"you're not part of our family\". Now, of course, that's toxic but that was towards the end of our relationships. I've done way worse.\n\n**3. Possible outcome/future?**\n\nCurrently studying philosophy to become a teacher. I've always wanted to become a teacher but recently found an interested in philosophy. Also currently doing admissions to study in France( I have dual citizenship). I do have goals in life it just sucks that I've done horrible mistakes and am alone(kinde). I accept them because those are consequences of my actions. I'm currently in recovery for OCD. It's going well in general but I do have downs sometimes. I always reflect and think of myself to try and become better. I did see a few of therapists but it's pretty hard to find a permanent one. Trying tho. In the end of the day, the past is something I no control over and that's fine. I try to go outside quite often, read books, socialize, etc. I do feel lonely but it is what it is, consequences of my actions. Do I feel happy in general? I would say so? I am definitely happier then before. I don't have panic attacks anymore, I don't feel sad often, I do feel happier and in peace more often. I'm able to trust others more often. \n\nI want to be a kind person who will love others no matter what(unless they're toxic with me obviously).",

Like I always try find way to occupy myself like house chores, writing, drawing, social media,video games,watching series. I don’t understand what you’re supposed to do if you have free time. I can’t think of myself just sitting on a couch staring at nothing and not get bored. Surely I go to work, where I also have to find things to occupy myself cause it gets quite boring a lot of the time, I attend my English classes once a week and my therapy group sessions also once a week. Besides that, I meet my friends once a week(they work a lot so I’ll be lucky to even meet once a week). I’m reading that escapism and distracting yourself is bad and that you shouldn’t ignore your anxiety/depression or any other mental illness. I managed to cut down on social media and phone usage and now my main hobbies are tv series and writing my book. What else are you supposed to do?",

        "text": "Let me get started by stating the obvious..... I'm lost.... \nSo I'm 26 turning 27 this year and I don't know what direction I want to go with my life right now. I feel like I have crossroads in front of me and I'm so indecisive that I'm having a nervous breakdown because I can't think clearly enough to come to an answer. \n\nSo last October of 2022 I was on a social app trying to make friends since in September of 21 I moved to FL from PA. so I have literally no friends or close friends down here to hang out with and it goes the same for my wife. I met with this woman who honest to God was extremely interesting, she had her own beauty business, has her own tilapia that she takes care of, she has chickens, has 2 kids that she home schools, has a garden filled with tomatoes and passion fruit etc, and even is going to college because she has aspirations for working at NASA one day, and on top of that she loves learning about the unknown and all the weird shit no one really likes to have conversations about. \n\nSo we were only interacting virtually at first and then it lead to her giving me her snap and eventually her number. Mind you this woman is 39 and I'm 26 so I thought it was just a normal thing that older people do when they like interacting with eachother. So we get to texting and I'm just in awe that this person even exists like she does so much and just her vibe and energy is so amazing. Well eventually with enough texting she told me she wanted to meet me. I was very cautious at first because as much as wanted to meet her I didn't want her thinking the wrong idea about me since I had someone. So we met at this park I would go to and went for a walk in the woods.... and interacting face to face with this woman was different than anyone I've ever come across even my wife.... she was asking me about my life and I was so comfortable with her that I told her deep issues and insecurities I had with myself that I've  never told anyone else not even my wife. Before you say something I just wanted to say I don't feel comfortable talking about interacting or thinking about my family with my wife because she loathes them all except for my mother so I always feel her rage and discontent whenever I mention family I stopped talking to ie my father or sister because she tells me to forget them and that they were replaced with her family like her dad and her brother...\n\nSo just being able to be this open with essentially a complete stranger was like breathing fresh air after being plugged into a respirator thinking I only have limited breaths. Then she landed a kiss on me unexpected and it just filled me with this electric type of energy that I've never felt. Also saying this I've been with only a handful of women in my life sexually but I've made out a lot growing up and having girlfriends and this was totally different than anything I've experienced. But the day passes and we part ways just still friends who kissed at this point.... and I told her the history I've had with my father who I felt like he abandoned me to choose a new life and said I felt just like him in doing so... \n\nI'm at home and just texting her still asking if it was only me that felt that type of energy and she told me she's never felt that way either. She's dating dating because her marriage was rocky and I didn't even know she was married till after she kissed me... but she said she's never experienced what happened between us and then we started talking even more because I told her it's like we were on the same wavelength. We had another interaction at Starbucks and there she tells me she's getting back together with her husband and that we can only be friends. I was hurt a bit that she didn't say this upfront but I didn't care either way since she's still in front of me so I was curious at what her intentions were in regards to us. About 2 weeks later we have another coffee date where she takes me to this bookstore she would go to and there we talked the whole time about conspiracy theories and just our views on the universe that normal people don't really ever talk or think about, then she tells me all of the shit and issues she's gone through in her life.... she beat cancer and almost died both times when giving birth to her kids, and on top of that she had a nasty fall where she hit her head and said she felt like she was having a schizophrenic episode because she didn't feel right.... so her husband had her admitted but didn't go see her, didn't let her kids see her, or her family... so she had to be all alone while trying to repair herself mentally after that... so this woman who I thought was super interesting and cool I find out her spirit is strong af because idk if I'd be able to have her outlook after going through all she has. But then she tells me that her husband's birthday is coming up and she's gonna make a decision on what to do with her marriage in that weekend...\n\nCoincidentally my wife's birthday was a day before her husband's and we were both taking our partners out to see family and friends. Even weirder we find out we're both Gemini me June and her May less than 1 week apart for us... so that was very odd to both of us. Then when I showed her a picture of my wife she looked shocked and told me my wife looks exactly like her husband's first wife.... very weird coincidences indeed. \n\n\nThat weekend passed and she told me she was choosing to be with her husband for a few reasons.... why did I feel so defeated, im married and so is she why was I butthurt about it. She even said we weren't meant to be so why should I feel sadness and not joy for her. \n\nI went off at her because I told her she had me mixed up in my feelings because I liked her a lot and I didn't want to lose her as a friend but I feel like it was too late since we crossed the line with kissing. Then she responds apologizing for getting me mixed up in my feelings and said it's better that she backs off because she never wanted to make me confused like that..... well I let a week go by before I realize I still want her as a friend... so I reached out and apologized and we met for coffee again and she told me not to put expectations on her because that's putting her in a cage and not allowing her to just be herself. So we started having dates during my work hours and lunch hours because we've never interacted with anyone like us, she even told me she's been out there a bit and that I'm an anomaly because I'm different than everyone she's ever been or interacted with so we take a day for about 5 hours and she took me by her home to pick up something she forgot. So here I am being driven around by this woman in her husband's car and she's taking me to her house.... like the amount of trust she had to even take me there just made me scream internally so when we get to this arboretum that's in the area I joked and told her if either of us were serial killers it would've been too easy because only we knew where we were going and hanging out with lol. And much to my surprise she jokes about it back saying oh yeah I'd totally do it here and just leave your body in the thickets..... I love that answer haha because it just resonated with my weirdness. \n\n\nSo we're emotionally having an affair because thinking about it my wife is rigid and rough emotionally and just buries trauma instead of trying to deal with it and I'm the opposite, I feel emotions too much and sometimes the emotions of others making me unsure of myself. But this woman is just like me, she listens to everything I have to say and doesn't give me cold responses or answers. I actually feel understood 😌. \n\nBut things go wrong with her marriage because since she's very spiritual and she said she stopped her journey at some point but decided it was time for her to start it up again. She does tarot reading and has an ancestor altar and even has mentors she goes to. She has visions and says the universe communicates with her and that even though she doesn't get the full picture she gets Fragments and later sees the bigger picture in hindsight. \n\nShe then goes into tell me she believes we're twin flames.... never heard about that at all but fine whatever. All I know is there's no one else like her... to put it plainly it's like our souls just know eachother without needing words. And I'm spiritual but interacting with her pushed me to awaken some blocked energies and even remembering trauma and memories that I've repressed as a little kid. \n\n\nBut since I'm married I only have rented out time to give her. That was an issue, because she's leaving her husband and she told me she wants me in totality.... I was unsure because I'm so young and foolish and I felt wrong and as if I was misleading her. To be honest I didn't feel good enough for a woman that great and she is wanting me to stay at her home with her when her family is out of town now... \n\nBut at the time my grandmother was dying and I caught the flu really badly for a week and a half so she told me I was filled with so much negative energy that she felt we needed to take a break. So we did and I again went off at her telling her not to give me her opinions on anything anymore. \n\n\nThis time 3 weeks went by and not a day went by that I wasn't thinking about her. So I again reached out to say she's speeds up my growth and that being apart from her blocked my energies again, I apologize for going off and say i will try my best to keep it at friends again. \n\nShe told me she felt the same way about the spiritual growth and that she wants me still there and I told her even if it's only as friends I'll be there because I have abandonment issues and if she really is my twin flame it would be like abandoning myself, so I can't leave if I want to fix this trauma\n\n\nThings are going great again with her, but in regards to my marriage I noticed that I was giving away too much of myself in only getting smothered essentially. I couldn't go anywhere by myself, can't do anything by myself without being asked how long I will take, can't even be in another room too long by myself in my home without her asking me when will I come downstairs. She wants all of me and complains how I'm her only friend and that she only ever wants to spend time with me. Don't know if she knew it but she made me feel guilty about wanting to even go get gas or go to the store or even pickup takeout food myself. I even try to push her to do things alone that she wants to do like ulta or Sally's.... shit I would never go to because I don't really want to.... but instead of going alone she puts it off and waits till I'm available or we're already out and about doing other things to do what she wants to do. Idk it just feels like we want different things in life, we think differently... for example I try random new things and places and she sticks to what she knows.... at a restaurant I'm the one trying new things and she's defaulting. Even ordering food to go if I'm in the mood for my craving I can't have it because she didn't agree. She wants to do nothing in regards to exploring with me and has her sights always on Disney stuff because she says it brings her the most happiness being there.... ok yes I loved going with her at first when it was once or twice a year.... but she wants to go monthly..... it's like her life is so drab Disney is all that makes her happy and we're in no way rich.... I live paycheck to paycheck but allowed her to take us to Disney because of her argument we'll never be this young again to experience it..... ok but what about anything else I've ever wanted to do like going to another state, going to a random town and staying there for a day... I can't do these things because of the big expense of going to Disney.... finally since she loves planning I told her.... well I screamed it out of frustration that I don't want anything regarding my birthday to be Disney anything, I'd rather visit her family and spend time with them..... since in moving down here I interact with family less and less and she bad mouths all of them..... I have no one to talk to except for my mother and I'm even scared to tell her my feelings and how I'm depressed with my life at the moment.... \n\n\nThen in regards to this other woman, she invited me to stay a weekend with her but I told her I'd only spend a night.... because even being apart from my wife for one night set her off, when I mention that she has me for 365 days and what's the point of 1 night she went off at me saying its not right..... why like I said I give you everything why can't i have this one day... things didn't go well but I wasn't going to let her guilt me into staying with her and feeling trapped. I'm over at this other woman's house for the night and I'm crying because I told her that I feel so overwhelmed by it all. Seeing how someone's life is without that... like with my wife even if I take a nap she'd wake me up angry that I'm sleeping too much and not spending time with her.... even going to bed she doesn't let me go alone we go together and she complains that she's not tired. We've taken psychedelics when we were in PA to mentally escape the reality in front of us then and we were so connected. Now taking them with my wife it's not the same and when she crashes she wants me to crash with her but I love staying up and pushing the limit of my sleep to see if I can go till the next day.... then I proceed to be yelled at by my wife. Back to the point though!!!! I was in the house of someone who didn't care where I was what I was doing, didn't force me to be next to her and it felt like a dream come true..... but then I broke her heart telling her I had to go back home because she wanted me for a whole weekend.... she goes off at me saying I'm playing with her feelings and that I never should've come over and I'm feeling truly awful.... it's like no matter what im hurting someone even without trying and even though I'm trying to make everyone happy...\n\nA day or two goes by and the woman told me that she's acting up and doesn't want me out of her life. She says she wants me and doesn't want to rush me to a decision since she still has to be with and interact with her husband so expecting me to leave my wife and 4 dogs and the life I had before. But she also said the universal timing is closing and divine timing will go away so I have to make a decision in a month.... \n\n\nFollowing that we had a coffee date where she admitted that she doesn't want to pressure me and that she loves me unconditionally no matter what and that's what keeps her returning because of that and like i said before to her im an anomaly in the matrix so she said she can usual figure someone out but with me she can't. \n\n\nThe other day I asked her to go to the beach with me and take in the scenery and it was there she told me that I dont have the freedom I thought I did. That she doesn't want rented time and that she wants dates with me long dates and nights without me running off somewhere. She said I'm always running off somewhere and it makes her feel as if I'm trying to hide her or lead 2 lives.... she's not wrong I just don't know what to decide...... either way I'm hurting someone and they're both my best friend one with history and tension and trauma but still a friend and the other with tension but because I'm still caging myself and not thinking bigger..\n\n\nShe said that I make myself a martyr to please others and forgo my own happiness and she's not wrong.... I'm tired of being a martyr but I don't want to hurt anyone anymore... I'm getting annoyed that all my spiritual lessons are brought about by pain.\n\n\nAs much as I want to please my wife it's killing me because it's like she's walking on eggshells and I have to limit myself and what I say. It's at the point where the fighting was so often and emotions running wild that I told her im a bad friend and husband if im the only one she interacts with on a daily basis and I still make her cry and feel like she has to limit her Disney talk because it gets me stressed about anything other than Disney.... \n\n\nEither way I lose a dear friend and I was so confused I actuality reached out to my father and asked him how he felt when he left my mom to be with another woman and it was shocking that everything he told me was everything I'm feeling right now... to put it plainly it feels good to make others happy every now and again but it's it worth the cost of your own happiness? And if you did choose your wife and try to work on it would it be a life filled with regret after? \n\n\nThe woman told me yesterday that she's tired of my indecision and that if I take too much longer she won't even be an option.... I hated that answer but I understood, it's not masculine to be this indecisive and I'm tripping over myself because it's like past and future and present are all colliding. I had a conversation with my wife in regards to opening the relationship and she asked me how I'd feel if someone came in and told her they wanted to spend the rest of their life with her. I told her of course anyone would fall in love with her and at the end of the day it's her choice who she chooses to be with and i guess that wasn't what she wanted to hear. She wanted me to say I'd be jealous because that's how she would feel but in all honesty, I've done a lot of thinking in the rare time I get alone and I love my wife unconditionally so no matter what that wouldn't go anywhere even if she did choose another. She told me her condition is I can't ever love someone or give myself to someone because she wants me all to herself..... totally different views on life. To me love is never limited its endless and I love everyone, as much as I love someone I don't want to hoard them or hide them away for myself because that's not love.... thats Stockholm syndrome.\n\n\nAll of this pressure makes me feel anxiety and to be honest I don't know what I want. Do I choose my wife and trying to save this one again because I made a vow to be there for her even though she doesn't treat me how I want to be treated. Do I choose this other woman who's always there for me and pushes me to talk to my family and reconnect with my father and ones I've cut myself off from. \n\nOr do I choose option C and choose to be alone so I can  heal myself and make sure I don't hurt those who try to get close with me\n\n\n\n\nHELP!!!!!!",

I dedicate an an hour a day when I get back home from work or whatever to respond to friends and use these apps to meet more people and focus on the individual self.\n\nI noticed that at the start of all of this, I a have a strong tendency to go on my phone and open up a social media app without even noticing that I am doing that.  Reflecting on that alone, I value the importance of getting all of these social media apps.  I noticed better communication with others, I feel like I have more time to spend when I am not spending 5 hours a day scrolling through my phone, I noticed more confidence, for example I do not compare myself to others anymore, and most of all, I feel like I am recovering from an unconscious addiction.  \n\nMy hopes were that everyone can wish me luck on this journey I am taking for self fulfillment.

        "text": "\nHello, I do not know where to start, but I will try to keep this short and clear. I do not understand why I feel that everyone else is better than me. Ever since I was a child, I was always absolutely convinced that I am inferior to everyone. I have always been looking up to others while looking down on myself as if I am unworthy of being alive. I am not sure where these feelings come from, but I think I hate myself for having a medical condition that I have no control over. I have a strabismus, and it makes me feel ugly and worthless. Of course, my parents tried their best to fix it, but it wasn't enough. I am not saying it's their fault because I know that, at that time, my country's medical system was too underdeveloped to handle cases like me. We managed to fix what we could fix, but the result is not \"perfect\" because the eye turn is still visible to others, which makes me feel uncomfortable. This reminds me of something: my guilt complex. I feel so guilty about the effort my parents put into treating my condition that I feel that my existence is a nuisance to others. Indeed, I always stay away from people because I am convinced that I am a pain in their necks. I just feel so ashamed of having them travel from an isolated Algerian city near the borders of Libya to the capital Algiers multiple times a year to see a doctor. Now I am 25, and because of these feelings, I am stuck. I can neither get a job nor a girlfriend. I have no friends because people think I am weird or arrogant, but I  reality, I am broken from the inside. I haven't even been taking care of my hygiene a lot, and I lost interest in all of my hobbies. I can't make any decisions because I just keep questioning myself all the time. The more I try to silence my brain, the louder it gets, and it just doesn't stop. I feel like giving up on life now.",

My brother spends most of his time hanging out with friends and whenever I ask him to hang out or play with me he says later but that later never comes. 2 months ago I cut off connection with a girl whom I had known for a year. We bonded a lot to the point where we used to call for 6 hrs straight without getting bored. I cut off connection because I was insecure and jealous. And I didn't deserve her. I can't stop thinking about her at all and it hurts. Then I was into gym and weight lifting been going for a year, I was passionate about it but now adays when I am at the gym I don't like working out. I am just deep in thought without realising it even at the gym. So I stopped going. I don't feel motivated at all to do anything and I am just stuck. I can't talk about it to anyone coz I got no one to talk too. Please someone help me improve. What can I do to not regret in future, how can I make my days fun and happy and have some friends. It's like a endless loop I can't get out of. Srry for how I wrote the long paragraph. I just wanted to let it all out😢",

I've sort of fixed my sleeping schedule, focussed on my goals, fixed my nutrition and overall the grind has been great. However, I've recently been feeling quite lonely/empty. I've left my old friendgroup, because all they did was gossip and hanging out with them felt more like a drag at times than a stress relief. I'm not anti social and I've got a few good seperate friends who I can have a laugh with. But although they're great people, they are not quite like minded nor reflect my energy. Also these friends have their own already solidified friendgroups. \n\nI catch myself being sad from time to time not having someone to discuss all of my interests with. Someone to share my deeper thoughs with, rather than casual small talk. Someone who I can laugh with, discuss hobbies, goals, philosophy, and reflects the same energy. Basically, a best friend. I've scouted, trust me, but in my school, at my job and my sportsclub I feel there is nobody who could fill this 'hole'. \n\nWhenever I feel this loneliness, I seek out people. I feel sort of fulfilled after a little while talking and joking with them, but that feeling fades quickly. I've started to long for a deeper platonic connection with someone. Due to this urge I've been feeling quite down lately and I've slipped on back into my old habits.\n\nThat brings me to my question: How do I deal with this loneliness while at the same time keeping up with my selfimprovement journey?\n\nTLDR: Been feeling lonely and started to slip, how do I find like minded people my age in my area?",

Well my \"why\" is being mentally strong and caple of leaving the comfort zone, and therefore grow and evolve all the time as a person\nall in an effort of becoming a sucsessful, happy grown up man.\n\nWould like to hear some thoughts from people who are also on the journey to self improvement.",

I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who is going through the same thing and would like to chat.\n\nI'm not necessarily looking for guidance, although any advice would be appreciated. Mostly, I'm hoping to find someone who can relate to my struggles and share their own experiences. To give you a better sense of who I am, I am a college student from the United States, and I have a passion for coding. It's frustrating to think about how much time I've wasted on my phone, time that could have been spent doing what I love.\n\nIf you're in a similar situation and would like to connect, please reach out.

        "text": "So I used to have an extreme amount of will power and motivation. At age 14, I started to workout and eat insanely healthy and clean and I stuck with everything I did for long periods of time easily. When I say I ate clean, I mean I did not consume a bite of junk food, gluten, or dairy for 5 whole years. During this time I would change up my diet, I was plant-based for 2 years then I was paleo for 2 and then mediterranean/Low inflammatory diet for another year after that. I was so strict I didn’t eat Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner for 5 whole years, I would bring my own food I made myself to stuff like that. I also was extremely dedicated to exercise. I did power yoga or pilates nearly every day. I also went through weight lifting phases where I gained a ton of muscle. I went 6 months where I was running 7 miles a day! I also drank a ton of water just naturally. I had such a superiority complex that I looked down upon and judged anyone who could not motivate themselves to do things that were good for them. I also had career goals and was dedicated to them and passionate about them. I was very active and I did numerous activities from swimming to surfing to wakeboarding to gymnastics etc. I’m not saying all of these behaviors were healthy, I had numerous overuse injuries from not letting my body rest properly and I developed gut issues from eating way too many vegetables and fibrous foods at times and I don’t think not eating thanksgiving dinner was a healthy or balanced mindset, but it was a stark difference from the person I am now. At 19 I herniated a disc in my back doing a deadlift and my life changed forever in a millisecond. I went from being strong and capable to not being able to walk, shower myself, or dress myself, or drive for 3 months. I was in severe pain and I became severely depressed from all the bed rest. With PT, that I still do every day, I was able to get back to a normal life where I don’t experience terrible pain unless I’m having a flare up, but I’m a completely different person than I used to be. I can’t do yoga or pilates or walk too much without experiencing severe pain the next day. I can only do my PT exercises and frankly I’m extremely bored of them but if I don’t do them I experience pain within 2 days. I’m afraid to do everything. I’m afraid to go on trips where there will be a lot of walking each day and I’m afraid to surf/do any of the activities I used to do. I’m severely depressed and I have no motivation to cook, clean, or attempt to slowly build up my exercise tolerance so I end up eating junk or takeout every day. Sometimes I just eat a bag of chips for dinner. I’ve lost 15 pounds from not eating right and losing muscle (I’m a female, I just happened to have a lot of muscle before). I can’t even bring myself to drink enough water everyday. Instead, I go out and drink with my friends and vape and smoke weed. At first, it was kind of exciting having everyone marvel at how different I was. I was suddenly fun and laid back when I used to be a control freak that nobody wanted to go out with because I’d have a million requirements for my meal like no butter in my vegetables etc and never wanted to have more than 2 drinks. I enjoyed my “moderation” for a year, but after that I was sick of it. However, now I’m extremely depressed and I have been for a year (I’m now 21 now) and I have no idea how to get out of it. I’ve been to 3 different therapists with no success. I decide I’m going to change my life and stick to a routine every week and it barely even lasts a day. I feel helpless. I used to be able to say I’m going to do something and just do it. Now everything is so hard. I get so tired and fatigued after doing everything, I can’t even keep up with my 50 year old parents. All my blood tests come back normal so my doctor thinks I have fibromyalgia now, brought on my the trauma. I have no motivation to work towards my goals anymore. I cry every single day sometimes for hours. I feel like I’ve lost my identity and I can’t get it back. I’ve become the person I used to look at and call lazy, someone that’s never going to get anywhere in life because they can’t motivate themselves to change or stick to anything. My family is worried about me. I used to be so organized and clean and now I go days without showering and sometimes can’t even bring myself to brush my teeth. Has anyone ever experienced such a severe personality change from trauma? How did you get past it? I can’t live like this anymore and I don’t understand why I can’t change.",

Maybe because i have an ego problem (which i think runs in my family). \n\nMy social life is decent, i have a good amount of friends and people who care about me, but i feel the need to impress more and more people and try to be the centre of their attention all the time.\n\nI was the youngest in my house and got the most amount of attention and love from everyone, but when i go out and don't feel the same it makes me feel worthless.\n\nThe lack of self confidence and ego work together to make it harder for me to strike a conversation with anyone, once the other person breaks the ice it becomes easy for me but when it comes to the opposite gender it rarely happens because most girls expect boys to start a conversation and i fail to do so.\n\nMaybe thats why i am still single (20 y/o), i have seen other boys talking my crushes over the years and succeed but i couldn't do it, because sometimes i feel the girls needs to ask me out (again ego) and sometimes i feel i am not worthy of her.\n\nSome days feel like they should never end because i am getting all the attention i need and others feel miserable because i didn't receive a reply or validation from a girl.\n\nPlease be honest and brutal with your comments, your any advice is important to me🙏.",

        "text": "So, a bit of context. A few months ago, my company hired a service so that we get to know our behaviour (DISC), our motivators and our emotional intelligence (EQ). A couple of days ago we got our results! The 60-page document explains very well how to interpret things, specially DISC and motivators, but it doesn't really explain how to improve my weaknesses, specially regarding EQ.\n\nSo, in the DISC section, my behaviour aligns very well with the C, with a bit of S. I feel comfortable with this definition of myself and I think it's accurate. What that means is unimportant for this.\n\nRegarding EQ, as per this test, I know myself very well. I know how I'm going to feel in a particular situation. I'm also fairly good at predicting someone else's feeling, as well as knowing how are they feeling in a conversation. The test says I'm moderately good at autorregulating myself, and I have no freaking clue at how influence and adapt to other people's feelings.\n\nMy issue, as you might have guessed, comes with these two last points, specially the very last one. I think throughout the years I have vastly improved in the autorregulation part. Stopping and thinking \"is this worth this reaction?\" has greatly helped me. But I still don't understand how to improve in the more social aspect, how to adapt to other people. All my life I have been told that I should tone down and not show as much emotions as I was doing, just for this test to tell me that most likely people consider me emotionally unavailable and that that's the reason they don't want to approach me or want to be my friends. It's true that I do have problems trying to make friends, but I don't have any issues to mantain relationships.\n\nI'm a huge mess right now. What can I do to improve myself? Could my (diagnosed) anxiety disorder have impacted the results of this tests, or are both independent? I'm very lost right now, I'd appreciate any insight, as my company refuses to do so.

So yeah.\n\nI am currently unemployed.\nI worked as a Waiter in Hospitality in the past. \n\nI had a Job at a Japanese Restaurant called Shoryu Ramen\n\nHonestly, at the risk of sounding Arrogant, I was the Smartest Guy at Shoryu, I deserved to be Manager, as opposed to just Waiter, I know I can prove my competence.\n\nAnd then I had a Job at a French Brasserie called Brasserie Zedel.\n\nBoth in Central London, can Google them, and read the Reviews. \n\nI was living with My Parents but I had some Dumb Argument with My Mum, so they Kicked Me Out.\n\nI have No Friends currently, so Nobody to ask to Crash On A Sofa.\n\nI literally have No Friends rn, it's Crazy.\nEveryone has Their Social Media with tons of conversations and everything, I don't.\nI don't use Instagram and I don't upload anything to it.\nI don't use Tik Tok. \n\nI Am A Talented Pianist to My Credit (Grade 8, DipABRSM)\nSo Potentially I can monetise my skills and teach some people what I know, which enabled me to sit those Exams and get those High Marks. \n\nI have No Money, well as previously explained I'm in Debt.\nI have like £0.60 in My Revolut Account \n\nAlso I have No Clothes, like I own barely any clothes.\nI could definitely do with some more Lol \n\nI don't Exercise.\n\nI live in the UK.\nAcademically I haven't attended a University.\n\nI did GCSE Exams and got 5A*4A2B \nI did A Levels but didn't study.\nI sat the Exams and got CDE.

        "text": "I \\[24M\\] feel extremely pressured and stressed in most social interactions. It has prevented me from entering the job market (I currently work part-time in academia and would attend graduate school in the fall, something I like, but I've had the time to work full-time), ever having a relationship or gf,  and making friends (I only have one friend whom I have a strong connection with, and we meet each other every few months because of distance and so on).\n\nThe odd part is that I am mostly ok with giving presentations and talking in front of an audience, but the day-to-day interactions kill me to the point that when I am walking behind a girl in the street, I worry they might think I am following or going to harass them. This contradiction, I think, hints at the primary reason for my bad feelings; I feel stressed because of power dynamics: there are certain areas where no one can deny my competence, and I am able to talk and even make jokes in those scenarios, but in any other situation that very strong and continual affirmation is not involved (most social situations where you initiate a talk or get to know someone), I feel I am inferior. The presence of any strong and dominant person makes me lower my voice unconsciously (as if signaling I am not going to make problems), being around someone who has a fancy house or car makes me uncomfortable, and a pretty girl around means I would leave the room and so on.\n\nTo give a little bit of context, I think two things mainly contributed to developing this situation for me: 1- I was made fun of throughout middle and high school for being overweight and having big breasts; I was, as a result, mostly alone and had a very bad personal image.\n\n2- My father, whom I respect and admire, has been obsessed with not discomforting people when we are at hotels, restaurants, and so on, especially when it is an expensive one, which makes him feel uncomfortable and not belong. He was born into a very poor family and worked hard starting from zero to make a good living for his family. My problem is the extended version of his.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat can I do to fix this Issue? Please let me know if you need more information on something.",

There are 3 part about procrastination\n   \n   Trigger\n   Routine\n   Reward\n\n  The routine is the thing you'll will do instead of the \n  intended thing you wanna do, procrastination is a form of \n  coping with stress so to combat this, try to put yourself in \n  a room without no distraction and work 5 minutes and pay \n  attention to it then take a break for a few minutes then do \n  it again, you mind and body will automatically wan't to \n  finished it all so the important step to cure it is to just \n  do it \n\n  Your emotion can be affected by your sleep and how you view \n  your situation.\n\n  Lost of sleep can cause you to be more reactive with your \n  emotion, bad thoughts about your failure and life can cause\n  you to act out on it and bum out on the whole day.\n\n  To combat this, if you ever have a bad thoughts.\n  \n  Analyze it why am i feeling like this and acknowledge it's a \n  manifestation on my mind and not true and pratice gratitude \n  that you are given a chance in life to both experience \n  suffering and joy\n  \n  Ask yourself with every thoughts, does this worth my time and \n  value or not\n\n  The thing you can control is your respond to the emotion. \n  Your mind is like a lake and the thoughts is those ripples in \n  it, you can only calm it down by letting it do it things and \n  slowly it'll calm the lake down\n\n  There will be days where you will feel like the routine and \n  everything you do is pointless and too hard for you so just \n  remind yourself why you started the journey and what you're \n  doing it for and think about how good yourself will feel once \n  you finally reach your goals\n\n  Your loved ones and your future self deserve the best version \n  of you so don't give up hope, stay strong my brothers.",

It's been a really hard few months for me and ive had to put up with alot of negative influence around me but ive been able to learn alot about myself. I had a mental breakdown and im working my way back from it trying to restablish a relationship with my brother because things have been really sour between us but im adamant on fixing it. Im considering starting therapy so I can talk to someone about my mental health problems aswell as get an idea of what a psychologist does because I feel drawn to helping people and I have a very psychological view of the world. I want to take the steps needed to pursue getting a psychology degree but I never graduated highschool. Im planning on picking up karate and BJJ in order to discpline myself aswell as get back to being social, I want to put myself in environments where respect and discipline are the norm. Ive started working out and ive quit smoking weed after years of being a pot head but ive started smoking cigarettes again to cope with the stress of everything thats happened. Im trying to turn my life around but im still facing negative aspects about myself in the process. Im hoping to go back to work soon and save up some money in order to pay for schooling in the future. I was wondering if anyone could help with what could I study up on if I plan to apply as a mature student in pursuit of a psychology degree? Any information, any help would be greatly appreciated and any advice on anything Ive talked about in this post is more than welcome. I have battled depression and questioned the meaning of life since I was very little and although I thought I could use my smarts to let me coast by, my over analyzation and overthinking seems to have gotten the best of me and created far to many problems for me. So please support me on my journey to reaching my full potential! Thank you",

I finally have an internship in May and I'm going to make a decent amount, about $20,000. I feel like this should be enough for me to live on my own for a while I also search for a job. Hopefully I'm hired by the place I'm interning at. I'm scared though, I've never lived on my own before. Obviously I would need to worry about bills and stuff, rent. I won't go far from my parents just the next city over that way I can visit when ever. Is this the right decision? What things would I have to worry about while living on my own?",
