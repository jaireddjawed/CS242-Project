I was also taking an SSRI at the time as well. I decided after a few months, it was getting a bit much and I wanted to go back on. I’m feeling symptoms now that I never felt the first time I was on it. Nausea and irritability to name a few. Last time I took it I went from 20 to 40, and now I went straight to 40. Is it possible the jump was a bit for me to take at once? Has anyone felt more side effects the second time taking vyvanse after taking break? \n\nAny insight would be much appreciated.",

Grew up not being able to focus, easily distractible, socially isolated\n2. Didn’t have a ton of friends, and when I made them they didnt stick.\n3. Put on ADHD medication because parents couldnt handle how wild I was and I was struggling in school\n4. Stopped medicine after 2 years because I was losing a ton of weight and caused me to be further withdrawn\n5. Fast forward to my first “big boy job” after high school (couldnt focus so didn’t complete college) at 20 years old. Fired because I fell asleep at my desk several times and couldnt focus enough on tasks or articulate myself enough to upper management\n6. Fired from second big boy job at 24 because I procrastinated way too much and “gamed the system” leading to being canned\n7.  Ended up in another big boy job at 27, making fantastic money, got the girl, the house, yada yada.\n8. Fired from job 3 years in for missing important details and not staying on task.\n9. Went through breakup with ex shortly after, spent next 6 months in a depressive state.\n10. Been at my current job for 9 months, killing it. Acknowledgment from upper management and csuite for being an up and coming talent. Just got fired today because they’ve noticed a major drop off of production the past 3 weeks.\n\nThey are right. Instead of taking my 20-30 leads a day (sales), I’ve been taking 4-5 a day. They told me certain metrics need to be hit and I’ve been doing a 3rd of those metrics even though I was way above and beyond what was asked of me not even 3 months ago. I’m just tired of constant self sabotaging. The worst part? I’ve been on Adderall the last 3 months and it hasn’t done anything the past month for focus and production. I’m just tired.\n\nTl;dr: Life full of being fired, productivity issues and social inadequacies has me tired.",

It’s been several weeks, but still a relatively new thing.\n\nSo, two things: sometimes, I notice that the effect of it isn’t as potent. When it does help, it can help me with negative thinking and staying on track with stuff. Like, my mood seems more stable when I’m on it. But, then, there are times, like today, where I’m just….nervous and insecure on it? And a bit shaky, too. Like, I do feel the effects of it still. I do feel better, in a way, and working still bothers me less. But, I’m a bit distracted by my mood. I feel hypersensitive today. I feel like everyone could be mad at me (even though I know they’re more than likely not), and I feel a little too in my head for comfort. I also have been diagnosed with BPD before, and it’s almost like a couple of BPD symptoms are more on display today. I’m back and forth on if I have both BPD and ADHD, or if all the stuff I’ve been experiencing could stem from ADHD, but that’s a topic for another time. I probably have both, though, lol.\n\nIs there something I could be doing at times that affects how Adderall affects me? What should I watch out for that could make the Adderall not work as well, or backfire on me?",

I couldn't remember ANYTHING. It was as if my life had started around last year and I hadn't experienced anything before then.\n\nHowever, earlier, I was sat down doing the same thing and it's like my memory is pitch perfect. I can remember buildings from my childhood from when I was 4-6 down to very fine details, their placement, what they felt like, memories I had with them, etc. I could remember pretty much anything from those parts of my life and it was amazing to be able to relive those moments after focusing on it.\n\nHowever, just a few hours later and. Nope. It's all gone again. Maybe it's because I'm distracted but it's all in bits and pieces again, very blurry. Other people can just think of it on the spot but I actually have to focus on it to even remember, but when I do, it's really vivid and strong.\n\nDoes anyone else get this?

Due to the shortage and insurance being awful to deal with, I was without medicine for about 2 months and used short acting Ritalin and and Aderall intermittently to get by. Finally, last week my insurance approved Vyvanse. \n\nThe first few days that I took it I felt amazing. I was focused, I didn’t experience any of the emotional numbing I had experienced with Concerta, and best of all I had control of my focus i.e. I was able to consistently sit down, organize my schedule and do my work as opposed to cleaning the whole house. Finally, after 22 years of struggling with ADHD, I found what works for me. \n\nAbout 4 days into taking it, things changed. I felt very hyper focused on things that weren’t important - reading about random subjects on my phone for hours on end. Didn’t feel present when I was out with friends this weekend. Little to know sex drive. In the past 2 days I’ve had a lot of physical symptoms such as nausea, really bad last, having to go to the bathroom constantly, and poor circulation. My first dose was only a week ago, but I don’t understand why I reacted so well at first only for it to change. Could this just be a small bump in the road as my body acclimates to taking the new stimulant. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms early on when taking Vyvanse? If so, did they go away? How long did it take for you to feel acclimated to the new medicine?\n\nI’m probably being a little neurotic as I was so excited by how I felt the first few days. Nonetheless, I would really appreciate hearing any of your insights or experiences after switching to Vyvanse! Thanks everyone!\n\nI",

Update my cv and look for a new job. \n\nI walked into the kitchen and wanted to get a coffee. I noticed my tomato’s going slightly bad. What a waste I thought, let’s make some lasagne, it won’t take long and I can have a fun thing in the oven before doing the not so fun thing..\n\nEnded up making lasagne for 25 persons at least. Spending way too much time on it because of this crazy portion. I realised it and I was like; ‘this was actually a very profound learning process, I know I have to cut the crap and start on my job search’. \n\nThen I looked out the window into my garden and had a near heart attack. Isn’t march thé month to be sowing seeds in order to get your flowers and crops somewhere around summer? I googled and I was right. This was the moment to sow. No Biggy I thought, I’ll be done in no time.\nEnded up cycling to the city centre to buy seeding plugs because hey, I was planning on doing so last year. But I didn’t. So this is the moment to make up for it.\nWhile I cycled past the market I thought maybe look for some cool seeds since it’s flower market today. \n\nFound cool seeds for sure. And I bought 10 packages of different flowers.\n\nWhile I was cycling home I though wait, I only have 3 small greenhouses. I can’t put 10 packages in there. I need to get some more and happen it to be I was right in front of the store I needed to be at to buy those. \nWasn’t I smart and am I not nailing my adhd here? I am on top of it!\n\nBought 6 more little greenhouses. Got home and started to plant all that great wonders that nature has to offer. I finished it, which I thought was a nice achievement for someone with adhd, right?\n\nThen it got to me, I haven’t done a think I was supposed to do for weeks, but I had a promise with myself to not be beating myself up at night because I failed again. \nI was like okay I’m really going to hit that cv and job soliciting now before I do anything else.\n\nMeanwhile the oven beeped. Lasagne was ready. I might as well have a taste at it since it will fuel me and I’m on fire for my real and only task today. \nBut.\nI don’t eat lasagne without a nice crisp salad.. but it won’t be a Biggy I’m having this salad ready in 5 minutes.\n\nUntil I thought some pickled cucumber would be nice to counter the fatty cheese that’s in there.. long story short. It wasn’t short.\n\nAnyway, salad as ready. But now the lasagne was cold. Pre heat the oven. Hop the lasagne in. And now I’m in this void, can’t start working on my computer since I will be beeped out of it when the food is ready, but don’t have anything else of importance to do.\n\nI have a look of my fruit and vegetable table. I remembered I bought a pound of chillies because I’ve seen a video on YouTube where this girl braided all the harvested chillies into one long strip of chillies. When I was at the market I thought I should do that too, they will just dry and not go bad. \nSo I braided my pound of chillies into a nice strip. Very happy with it hanging in my kitchen.\n\nOven beeped, food is ready. I have my food, the first food of the day because I was so pre occupied with the lasagne from the morning on.\n\nAte my lasagne and salad. Got the after dinner dip. Fell asleep on a chair. \n\nJust woke up and thought this is really something to post on Reddit regarding adhd.. the day has past and am telling myself I will do better tomorrow but I already thought of baking a cake tomorrow.\n\nCan you guys relate? It happens to me every time while I’m on medication. It’s crazy to think of all the work I actually do in a day but being unable to do the small tasks that actually have priority. And I would feel supported when hearing I’m not the only one. Also curious to hear your crazy stories so we can have a laugh (and a small tear)",

Ive wanted to cut this person out of my life for a long time. They always have me walking on eggshells, take a weird personal stake in my decision-making and take things Ive opened up about, exaggerate them, and throw them back in my face when they are seemingly bored/hungover/likely manic/who knows. I’ve tried setting really clear boundaries such as “don’t ask me invasive questions over text at random”, I share when I don’t feel comfortable sharing anymore and they lash out. They judge me for things I have done, yet have done those same things to much more extreme extents. Mostly talking partying, drinking etc. I have decided to become sober and can clearly no longer have this person in my life- honestly I was only able to put up with the crazy while impaired. They seemed totally understanding of my wanting space, then the next day just stirred the pot and made things explode by messaging my girlfriend something cryptic implying our relationship conflict was public knowledge. This person also has a bit of “dirt” on me in that exposing some events could lead to a lot of stress in my life so I need to stay really calm. I somewhat trust them not to do this, but also, who knows. They’re actually super erratic. \n\nAnyway. I’ve blocked them on everything. They are seemingly mad at me for whatever reason. This is where my issue comes in. I cannot get the intrusive thoughts about this out of my head. Catastrophizing, paranoia about run-ins. Etc. I think I have RSD and it’s really activated. I did not lash out back at the person in question. They’re behaviour is SO insane it actually calms me down. Does anyone have any coping techniques for this type of this hyper fixation? I feel like I want to run away, but I know and am confident I am in the right here.",

Antidepressants barely helped me. \n\nIn my childhood I was always an extreme daydreamer. Once the kindergarten teacher told my mom, that she should go to the childends doctor because Im daydreaming alot and not paying attention.\n\nWell the doctor told my mom, that she should not worry and it is a great thing when children are in their own head... how different my life migh have been If another doctor would ve diagnosed me. \n\n I barely could pay attention in my classes and most of the time I was just in my own head thinking about different stuff or sometimes just having brain fog. \n\nEmbarrasing stuff happened to me in school because not being able to focus and I always struggled with exams. My grades were always like a C- to a D/E. Especcally under time pressure I was performing extremly bad. I was always a slow worker and a slow learner. I always have the feeling that everything takes so much more time in comparison to other people. I worked as a nurse for a few years after graduation and I have the feeling that I always had to work longer then other people because my mind was not that sharp. A lot of times I had to work longer because I could not get my work down in time. \n\nNow Im at university and It takes always so much time to get my papers done. \n\nI have the feeling in terms of work I am always much more stressed then other people. I think this is due to the fact Im really bad at remembering stuff, so I have to invest much more time then others and then im panicking. \n\nIm visiting a therapist and told her once If I have adhs? But she is not the kind of the person who wants to put labels on people. \n\nBesides I take some Medication which I tried to taper in the last 3 years. (Taperin symptoms are strong). In support with my therapist I managed to taper a lot. From Effexor XR 150 mg to 30 mg. Sertralin 75 mg to 25 mg.\n\nMedication Im taking: \n\nEffexor XR 30,74 mg 1-0-0\n\nSertraline 25 mg 1-0-0\n\nMirtazapin (Remeron) 0-0-15 mg\n\nI have a my quarterly psychiatrist appointment next thursday and I never told any doctor If i might have ADD nor did any psychatrist ever asked me. Sometimes I believe my depression is the cause of ADD because It got me in a position of low self esteem. \n\nI never got diagnosed to this day so Im not sure.. \n\nAny help is welcome!

Can someone explain this to me)  and finally it’s actually working. If you can, I’d go to a pharmacy a bit farther away and get your medication, ESP if you’re in a big city. \n\nFinally my meds are working and it’s so weird I’m having to get used to them again. I’ve taken adhd meds since I was 7 and I’m 28 now. I’m so thankful they are working. I’m going to get them filled an hour away for awhile. It sucks but I can’t risk a month of non functioning.",

We’re starting to think if maybe he is on the spectrum as well, since he’s older it’s more noticeable how tough social ques are for him, but yet to get a diagnosis.\nLast year he switched from a very small charter school which he knew everyone, to a new, much MUCH bigger school. It was a struggle academically and especially socially. This year we got him into the “Big Picture Program” which is smaller, a lot of the kids struggle with the pace of traditional school, also they have work internships. He loves it, though it’s not as structured as I’d like, he has found his tribe and he’s happy. His friends and him are the alternative, dyed haired, pierced LBGTQ+ group, and I love that he found them.\n\nThe problem is, is that they are “low key” assholes to him. I have seen texts and they put him down, tease him tell him he seems autistic (which he might be but I think they are trying to be mean) &amp; seemingly leave him out of things. He is gullible so he believes their lies and sometimes doesn’t get the jokes. Like I know kids are jerks but it seems like he is the only one that gets this treatment. And he doesn’t stick up for himself. I think he’s just happy to have friends he allows it. I told him what I saw and how I feel about it and he makes excuses that they are kidding or they were in a bad mood.\n \nPlot twist and I don’t know if this makes any difference. Two of the friends are FAB with male pronouns, my son didn’t know for about three months, and after he found out I think they have been treating him different. My son is a cute kid, could it be a crush situation? Hormones? Or just jerk kids? I don’t want to keep him from his tribe but he reserves kind supportive friends. Thoughts?",

I had completely vague \"chest pain\" for years and then one day, it just vanished.\n\nIt's now been replaced with a weird feeling in my ankle (that maybe I just made up?) and I focus on it ALL the time. No swelling. No other symptoms. Just a generic discomfort in my ankle. I can't accurately describe it, it's just a \"weird feeling\". My doctors always figured it was just anxiety, but even with Xanax (which helps with everything else) these sensations don't really go away. However, if I find something sufficient enough to distract myself, I will not feel the \"pain\" or realize it's even there until I stop focusing on the other thing, at which point I will notice the \"pain\" and start obsessing over it again.\n\nHave any of you ever experienced something like this?

I tried seeking professional help by myself, but the professionals were so bad that they ended up making me feel worse. One of them said that “I was directionless and scatterbrained, and needed to get my act together or I’d be wasted potential”. This is without any advice to help me get rid of said scattered brain. (This isn’t a way to discourage anyone from seeking help. I’m just relaying my experience, and hope to myself be able to seek proper professional help as well)\n\nPrescription is a big no no in most places. So I just wanted to know, for my own sake, how it works, and how to seek help. If I understood it in medical terms, I might ease into taking the plunge. I’m really tired of living with no help, and it’s severely affecting my life. \n\nI’m from India, so if there are any Indians here who have been able to get help, *please* let me know. \n\nThank you!",

Today I had to have the day off work because I just could not get my brain in gear. It was like I couldn’t form a coherent thought while simultaneously having about 20 thoughts at the same time. I felt so unbelievably exhausted too, like the thought of doing absolutely anything, even just making some toast, felt like a mammoth task. I felt like I’d just woken up from a deep sleep, but all day. I tried to go for a walk to shake it off and it felt like I was wading through sand and all the noise and visual input was so overstimulating. It was like being incredibly depressed. But I wasn’t sad, instead I was absolutely bombarded with severe anxiety. On the inside, everything was firing at 2874738x speed and on the outside I was unable to even get out of bed. \n\nI finally got my meds delivered at mid day and took one. Man, I forgot how good it feels to just be able to… actually think. And comprehend my own thought processes. And separate different thoughts strands to isolate what I need to focus on. \n\nBefore this all happened, I was thinking my medication wasn’t doing anything but this has shown me totally different. I will never take my meds for granted again, this last two weeks have been HELL. Honestly wondering how I survived like that for 23 years.",

When I was younger I was so energetic and no one, not even my teachers, knew how to keep me focused and level headed. When I started kindergarten I began taking medication, I was always underweight due to my eating issues caused my the medication and when I got older I had issues with overeating when I didn’t take the meds. When I began to take my medication less, I enjoyed how I felt off of it. I was on Vyvanse from age 5-18. My friends were always thrilled at school when I forgot to take my meds because I was always so jovial and talkative off of it. I eventually stopped taking it and it’s been about 4 years without it. I appreciated it in school because without it I doubt I would have graduated. Personally, If my kid(s) are diagnose with ADHD, my first response wouldn’t be medication. While I understand that it is necessary in some cases but to me, especially in a very young child, that would be my last resort. I feel as though I was stripped of my personality and social skills growing up because without it my social anxiety has been almost nonexistent and I’m just much happier \n\nI’m curious about the ADHD communities opinions and anecdotes with medication. I’m in no way against medication, I think it’s amazing that medication can people that sense of clarity and make them feel good. I truly wish that were my experience during the about 14 years that I was taking it.",
