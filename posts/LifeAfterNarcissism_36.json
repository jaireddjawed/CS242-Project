I've been going to therapy for the last two years and understanding Ns behavior a lot better and how to speak up/stand up/set boundaries for myself. \n\nI don't have a social life. My last roommates I moved here with ended up scapegoating me on things that went missing so I walked away from that. The few friends I do have are busy with their own lives. I want to use bumble/tinder to meet friends but I feel like I need to be extremely guarded and watch everything the other person does to make sure they're not a N. \n\nI want to meet people but I'm terrified of meeting another N especially since I was a N magnet in the past. Do you folks have anything helpful to add? Similar situations? I do activities by myself so I'm okay with being alone. I just really want a friend to talk to. The only face to face I get is when I see my therapist.",

        "text": "Long time lurker here. It’s been four years since the divorce from my BPD ex was final. We’ve been separated for 5 ½. I’ve been in very infrequent, as-needed contact with her. In that time I’ve achieved long-term sobriety, gone off all psyche meds, relieved my therapist of regular duty, maintained a stable, loving home for my college aged sons, discovered how joyful a loving relationship with a sane person can be, and marked many, other positive milestones, large and small.\n\nThis week is also the date when the house I still own with NX must be sold, by court-order. It’s an updated, mortgage-free place in a prime location in a nice, older neighborhood, and it should fetch a decent price. The market is good right now. \n\nBut, NX could screw up an anvil. For two years she has neglected the yard. It is literally a jungle of weeks, vines, and woody shrubs left to run wild. The outside is trashed, front yard and back. Zero curb appeal. Except for areas that smell of cat pee ( !!! ) and cigarette smoke (seriously, who starts smoking at age 48?) the inside is OK-ish, I think.\n\nThis week she announced that she was putting the house on the market as-is, and thus may compromise literally tens of thousands of dollars of equity. And it’s not her decision to make unilaterally. I said, “No way.”\n\nNX hired a real estate agent, a mutual acquaintance from college days. The poor woman has no idea what she’s getting into. She’s already entertaining NX’s crazy-making ploys, speaking sympathetically about what an emotional time this is for everyone; how we should all just calm down.\n\nI’ve been on the brink of bankruptcy for years now. Waiting to sell the house was based on our younger kid living with the ex until age 19, but he moved in with me two years ago after suffering abuse by NX. I’ll still pay alimony for three more years. I have $100 in my savings account, and $5.64 in checking. My credit has tanked, credit card is maxed, and I live paycheck to paycheck, praying that a $500 surprise repair doesn’t pull us all the way under. That house needs to be on the market NOW. \n\nBut here we are, waiting on our friend the agent to instruct a grown woman on the importance of avoiding the impression that the house is abandoned. Agent-friend isn’t much of a listener, and she’s unaware of what is in store: irrationality, instability, histrionics, and major control issues. (I predict they’ll be bitter enemies before we’re done.) \n\nIt will get done, eventually. Hopefully without more legal action, but that’s an option. (But I still owe my lawyer from my successful custody suit, however.) This is the last major obstacle. But holy crap, getting back on the dance floor with Borderline Betsy is the worst. Selling this house will bring profound relief to my family. This is purgatory. It sucks.\n",

        "text": "My dad's family was pretty normal. They were generally happy people, glad to see you, they had a sense of humor, they didn't do drama and games. The Nm's family was always miserable, critical, nasty and judgmental. I had a step grandfather on the Nm's side that was always nice to me. My grandmother and Nm hated him and complained about him constantly. Apparently he drank. They considered him an alcoholic. If he was I never saw the bad side of it. The grandmother was a bigger narc than the Nm and crazy religious so I don't know if the step grandpa really had a drinking problem or if the problem was that the grandmother just didn't approve of any drinking due to her uber rigid religious mandates. \nHe was the only one on the Nm's side that acted like a genuine human. \n\nAs I try to sort out my past and all the other people who I had contact with growing up I keep finding these people, my dad's family, teachers, friends parents, that were genuinely nice people. They were a positive influence on me and treated me like a person. In among this the Nm wove like a ribbon, stepping in to put me in my place, to tear me down again. But in all of this if I take the Nm out there were people that were decent, that didn't treat me like crap, that showed me cool things and loved life. I feel like I am now trying to cut the memory of the Nm out of all of this like a long stringy tumor on my past. If I can maybe I can put together the good parts and how they shaped me. The Nm did everything she could to try to kill off those good parts. ",

        "text": "So I'm taking a break from therapy for a few months for various practical reasons to do with work and money. I might go back after a few months or I might leave it a bit longer so I can concentrate on settling into a new job and paying off some debts. \n\nI feel more okay about this than I could ever have predicted. My therapist told me that therapy never truly ends because he will always have my back and in a way he will always be with me. I used to hang on every last second of every session but now I feel like therapy is bigger than an hour in a room, if that makes sense.\n\nI've never been someone who likes to take breaks from therapy, and when I searched for threads on this they were more about people taking a break as therapy wasn't helping or they were finding it hard to cope with. I don't feel like I'm done with therapy, but I feel okay about taking time out.\n\nI'm curious, though, because I didn't think I would feel like this unless I had actually properly grieved in therapy. I remember soon after I started going I read a post on another site by someone who said that, in therapy, they needed to honour their pain and there was a lot of it. I don't feel like I've done that. I had this idea that I needed to spend whole sessions crying. That I needed to talk out loud about things more. I didn't think I'd feel like I do now without that. I don't quite understand how I've reached this point (despite doing some training in therapy myself!) as I swear I've spent most of my time in therapy arguing and complaining (which my therapist said was because I needed to protest about how my parents treated me).\n\nI no longer feel the agony of separation that I used to feel in breaks from therapy. I've just had a two week summer break which worked well as a trial run and now I have one more session to go. Other things have got easier too: today I saw an X Factor contestant talk about how close she was to her parents and it didn't trigger the desperate feelings it used to.\n\nThis isn't how I thought healing would go. But here I am. And I'd love to hear from others who've been in therapy long-term about what progress and healing was like for you. ",

        "text": "I can't believe I've fallen into another narcissism trap. So, long story short: my mother has NPD, I've been in a handful of romantic relationships with men with NPD (I should mention, I've also been in and out of psych wards for most of my youth, so, lots and lots of baggage here), and I have been in a very healthy, non-NPD relationship for the last 3 years He is a wonderful man- so caring, kind, smart, genuine, handsome, good provider, and truly understands me and what I've gone through in my life. We are truly happy together. And thennnnnn-\n\nNew guy starts at work. I'll call him NG. He is super cute, but I don't really pay him much attention at first because #1, I have a boyfriend, and #2, he is much younger than me and seems immature. After awhile, he starts paying attention to *me.* He would come up to my desk just to chat. He is VERY charming. He makes me laugh and he's really smart. \n\nThen, my coworkers and I all started going out after work. That's kind of when things started to go bad. I've just got glimpses of memories of things that happened. He bought me a drink- okay, harmless. He called me gorgeous, okay- that's nice. He made me feel *comfortable.* I felt like I could tell him anything. My thoughts started wandering to what it would be like to be with him, to kiss him, etc. Then I started hanging out with him alone. Nothing sexual ever happened, but there was definitely flirtation and eventually I had to tell him that I couldn't hang out with him alone (despite the fact that I could not stop thinking about him and didn't really want to stop hanging out with him). \n\nMy thoughts grew more and more obsessive, despite the fact that we weren't hanging out. Every waking moment was spent thinking about this guy. We'd see each other at work, we'd flirt- he gave me these hugs that were like the BEST hugs I've ever had. He'd pick me up, spin me around, and my heart just melted. And then all of a sudden it just stopped. Out of nowhere. Me and the coworkers went out with him one night and he ignored me the entire time. He would pass by me at work without even looking at me- basically pretending I didn't exist. It hurt me so bad. I cried and cried and wondered what I did wrong. I'd text him to see if he wanted to smoke after work and he'd ALWAYS say no or just not answer at all. It went on like this for a month or so. Although my heart felt broken, I slowlyyyyy started to get over it and move on, and feel happy in my beautiful long-term relationship again. Then, there he was again in my line of vision. He brought me coffee a couple times, walked with me to school after work- again, nothing sexual. \n\nI understand this is a long story. But I need to share. A few days ago, we were working the same shift and he walks in and swoops me up and gives me that amazing hug again. I even say out loud, \"Awww, yessss!\" because it felt like coming home. And he's texting me during work to see what time I go on lunch, and asks me if I want to go to the park after work and hang out. During lunch break, he lays down on the couch I'm sitting on and lays his head in my lap. He touches my knee. I let all of this happen because it feels good. \n\nThat afternoon, we hang out for about two hours and we talk about everything that has happened. He explains that he's busy, he's got a lot going on his life, he's dating someone casually, and somehow he gets me to tell him that I have feelings for him, and that if I didn't have a boyfriend I would want to sleep with him. The whole time, he's touching my knee, my hand, laying his head in my lap, staring deeply into my eyes, and then he says, \"If it wasn't for your boyfriend, I'd have kissed you by now.\" It was what I wanted to hear. It felt good to hear it. We walk to his car, he tries several times to get me to kiss him but I won't, as much as I'd like to. I go home and I am so satisfied with what had happened and I start thinking on whether or not I should just break up with my boyfriend to be with this guy. We are a normal couple: we have fights, we go through hard times. But I DEFINITELY don't want to break up with my boyfriend (under normal circumstances). In fact, we talk about marriage all the time.\n\nI know that NG isn't going to be at work for 6 days. I text him when I get home after hanging out with him that it was good to be with him and that I'm glad we finally talked. No answer. The next day, I send something fucking stupid, \"should've kissed you when I had the chance\" after a particularly shitty fight with boyfriend. He actually comes into work that day to meet up with coworkers for a pool party that I am not invited to. No answer after the kiss text. And then a third time, while I'm drunk walking home from hanging out with a friend. I just say, \"hey.\" No answer.\n\nAfter a grueling six days of not seeing him, obsessing over him, wondering what I did wrong, why he doesn't like me, crying and having panic attacks- he returns to work. And walks right past me without saying a goddamn word. I think, okay maybe he's busy. But it happens again. And again. He walked past me three different times without even looking at me. I go home feeling like the worst piece of shit in the entire world. \n\nI can't tell my boyfriend why I feel so shitty (ps, we live together). I haven't cheated on him but I've allowed someone else to completely take over my entire being. This has happened before. I don't know why I didn't see it immediately but I didn't. I thought I was so over being attracted to narcissists, but I guess I'm just not even close to where I thought I was. I feel like such an asshole. I'm not sure what to do- I find myself looking up how to destroy someone psychologically because I feel emotionally raped and I want to make NG feel just as shitty as I do. But really, all I want is to forget this ever happened and continue moving forward in my relationship. What a stupid idiot I've been.",

        "text": "I'll have reached 3 years NC this November with NMom, and it's been 2 years NC with her golden child. When I found out my golden-child sister was going to have a baby, I found myself experiencing various conflicted emotions. My predominant feeling was sorrow for the baby at the pain he will no doubt suffer with a malevolent, narcissistic mother that is my sister. I seemed to get a handle on how I felt towards my mother, and wrote the following letter that will never be sent to maintain NC:\n\nDear Mom,\n\nYour golden child gave you another grandchild, and I am happy for you that you have another chance to experience being a grandmother. I hope you don't fuck it up. You previously had access to my children, but lost that when you failed to resist your destructive impulse to recruit my wife as a would-be minion. I allowed her to preserve your ties to our kids even after your and my ties were severed, and took no pleasure in completely severing those ties when your personality disorder made any reasonable degree of contact impossible. As with most things, you and your golden child will blame me for the consequences that your respective behaviors have wrought. When she stupidly crowed about her insight to my family's activities in an attempt to make it known that my boundaries were being further disrespected, I reacted by thoroughly restricting Facebook access via mutual friends which included having my mother-in-law remove you and her father restrict you in Facebook. This was the final voyeuristic window either of you had to my family, and your golden child laughingly attempted to make me feel guilty for your consequent sorrow. Your sorrow and her anger stem from the same priority: entitlement to my life, of which I've decided neither of you are allowed to be a part.\n\nI suppose that any narcissistic supply you've been fueling yourself via the corpse of our relationship has mostly dried up. It's going to be three years in November, and our separation has taken on the semblance of a death. As with most deaths, the comfort and sympathy of others may be steady and plentiful in the beginning. But soon, that support shifts to an expectation that you move on with your life and we both know how important to you other people's expectations are. You've undoubtedly dragged my name through the mud for all the sympathy you could garner, and have since attempted to present an image of how brave and strong you are for having selflessly survived such an abusive and cruel son. And now your strength, bravery and benevolence has been rewarded with the birth of a grandchild from your \"good\" kid! Because if we know one thing, it's that this kid's birth is going to be all about you in your mind.\n\nHow validating it is to know you'll continue using what little you have of me (my memory) as an accessory for additional narcissistic supply. All of your love and public displays of affection for your new grandchild and your golden child daughter will continue to carry the self-piteous subtext \"I nearly didn't have this because my son abandoned me\". That's my value to you. As the smallest person I've ever met, your value to me is serving as a useful example of who to avoid becoming in life. When I identify the most selfish aspects of my behavior, it's easily attributable to you and something I'm not conflicted about changing.  That's why you're dead to me, and why I've made myself dead to you. I hope that my departure has sobered you enough to comprehend that you could yet lose what good remains in your life. While your fear of many different things has resulted in the death of our relationship, your fear of losing anybody else will hopefully preserve what you do have. While you continue using me as a scapegoat to bemoan what you don't have, I'm content knowing that I've given you the greatest gift you have left in your life: to be grateful for what you do have. As for me, I'm grateful for who I have and don't have in my life.",

I'm 28F, moved from the east coast of the US to Los Angeles in January both as far from my Nparents as I could get and still be in the continental United States and also just where I wanted to be. It took a few months to really get on my feet, stop self-sabotaging, and get rid of a raging N roommate, but I went NC with my parents in May, I shook off the psycho-N roommate when I moved at the beginning of August, and I *finally* got a job two and a half weeks ago that not only pays well but the people are incredibly nice. It's not what I want to do forever, but I've gotten to a point where I can not judge myself or define myself by whatever job I have. It pays the bills, it's not who I *am* (that was a hard lesson to learn.)\n\nLong story short: life is pretty damn good right now, and I almost don't know how to handle it. I still have severe anxiety attacks, usually one every day or two (this is down from living in a *constant* state of high-alert for basically 27 years.) I'm dealing with those. But no, the thing that's really *really* bothering me is that for the past week and a half every night I've had nightmares about my Nmother finding me, or about being dragged around behind her like a good pet, or about being stuck with her without my voice, or being forced to cater to and pamper her every need, or supremely bizarre dreams where I'm in a happy loving relationship and she shows up and dictates every single thing about my life and steals my significant other. I don't even have an SO. I've *never in my life* had an SO because of my Nmom. I wake up shaking, heart pounding, trying to get my breathing to slow down so I can get back to sleep. And it's not just every night, it's multiple times a night, sometimes five or six of these damn nightmares. It's like my brain is punishing me for being okay, for being independent, for being completely free of her thrall and actually *existing* really fucking well without her influence, \"help,\" or input at all. Will these stupid nightmares go away? Are they like the death throes of the programming in my brain all expelling itself at once like the pus from a pimple? Come on, brain! We're in a good place now! We're doing this thing! Stop waking me up every hour and a half in terror!",

If you guys can give me some tough love, that would help immensely. \n\nBasically he cheated on me repeatedly, we broke up. He is in the process of joining the army, and his text said \"I just spoke with ____ (the girl he cheated on me with lol). She said you were planning on quitting your job and moving with me after I started in the military?\" Blatant lie, I never told that girl anything, never once even hinted at the fact that I wanted to move for him (that's ludicrous we dated less than 6 months). I KNOW his text is crazy and I should ignore but the temptation to defend myself against his stupid lie is so strong. Help!",

        "text": "So I have a Nsister we have been NC for over 5 years. My mom has been NC as well for the same reasons with her. \n\n  My Nfather died and my Nsister just went off the rails and tried to steal my inheritance when told no and my mom backed me up she threw a screaming fit and refused to speak to us till she got what was hers. Thank goodness I was so relieved. \n\n  Prior to my Nfather passing away she abused her POA badly and steps had to be taken to stop the behavior. \n\n  My Nsister also behaved badly at my Nfather's wake to the point that I got up and left. She and Ngrandmother were neck and neck for who was going to out crazy the other for attention. Personally I think my Nsister won with the poster board sign in glitter letters saying ' Don't hug me or I'll cry' around her neck. She was in her late 20's and a mother and people who she worked with were there. Drama always drama. \n \n  So moving on to right now my mom lives with myself and my family has for many years. After everything we dealt with my Nsister my mom doesn't want her around or to even know that she is sick. Because of drama and abuse. She would start shit just to be nasty and get back at me for whatever reason in her mind that I deserve it. \n\n  We live on the other side of the country now and have zero contact with her. Other than briefly earlier this year due to a stunt by another family member and nothing has changed she was just as rude and nasty if not worse and we all decided that we are never doing that again. \n\n  My mom waited 2 years to change her will after going NC. My Nsister came out of nowhere after 2 years and was just really abusive and mom changed her will the following week. Not as a punishment but to stop my Nsister from causing problems later on out of spite. \n\n  So contacting any friends for support unfortunately could get back to my Nsister and which is something none of us want. \n\n  In fact my mom has told me that when she passes away to not say anything till all the paperwork is done. She is not really receiving anything anyway. And she doesn't want me to deal with it. \n\n  I guess I'm just frustrated because I feel like I need to tell the people that are important to my mom and I but can't because of the massive shit storm that would/could happen as a result. \n\n  I fully agree as does my husband with my mom because I don't want to deal with it. I have repeatedly asked my mom if she is sure she doesn't want me to let anyone know and she has said that she wants nothing to do with them at all. I just need support because we moved here recently and have no support system at all. \n\n  It's just hard and I know that my mom is trying to protect me as is my husband from the abuse as well as our younger kids. \n\n  And after what my mom saw when my Nfather died and the way I was treated as well as my kids she just wants nothing to do with either of them anymore. My mom and Nfather were divorced for about 20 years when he died. \n\n  I have always been thankful for my mom because she was my saving grace from becoming like my Nfather's family. So it's my turn to protect her from any abuse from my Nfamily. I guess I just needed to vent and some support. Has anyone been though something like this?",

Because of this, sometimes I feel anxiety about seeing my in-laws, and feel like creating more boundaries will help me feel more secure in those situations. It becomes a vicious cycle of needing to feel in control of myself and like the responsible parent to my child around them, while shooting myself in the foot trying to protect us both.  I hope this makes sense to someone, sorry for the rambling. ",

We went to the boardwalk last night and my MIL gave the kids coins and tickets to play all the games and rides. My toddler was in heaven. Watching his unbridled joy made me burst. We did normal mom and kid stuff. He did normal dad and kid stuff. He played with his cousin, aunt &amp; uncle, and his grandparents. We had pizza and sweets. They won toys. And my heart healed a little bit more. Even though my nephew had some emotional struggles (his parents suck and are emotionally abusive and there isn't much we can do bc his dad-my husbands brother- is a drug addict and won't step up. so we have no legal recourse. So we just love him as much as we can, as healthy as we can) it was still a normal family outing. \n\nNo one got mad over stupid shit. No one's mood ruined the evening. We bought sunglasses for our nephew as a special treat and we let him pick out WHATEVER HE WANTED even if we didn't like them. It made him happy, so we got him what he wanted. No one was made to feel bad for what they wanted to do or not do. \n\nIt was beautiful and I'm so glad my kids &amp; I get to experience this. ",

        "text": "I'm sure that this has already been discussed but I was looking for some advice.  I grew up with an NMom and a borderline NDad.  I always knew that my family was eccentric.....but I never saw all the pathology.  That was until I started seeing a therapist because of romantic problems.\n\nWhen I was in my early twenties I felt this desperate need to be in a relationship.  This lead me into a relationship with a few nice guys but also with a borderline personality who attempted suicide and a raging N who was physically abusive.  I got through these situations, (still with no idea this was a pattern from childhood) and ended up in a 5 year relationship with a really gentle, funny guy.  I was in love for real....probably for the first time.  Things started to sour when I realized this person was perpetually dependent.  I didn't realize at the time but I was actually excited about the fact that he was somewhat 'broken.'  He needed fixing and I needed to fix someone!  (Still clueless that this was a pattern of mine, I still thought I had a great childhood).  \n\nInevitably my discontent with 5 yr guy started to show.  Sure I wanted to fix him, but soon realized people don't really change.  This was a tough lesson because I truly cared about him....but I also resented him. (sound familiar?) We parted ways after 5 years and I was truly crushed.  I thought this was going to be it.  If I had truly been honest about what I wanted and needed it would have ended sooner.  I think there was this part of me that was obsessed with the struggle of it all.\n\nFast forward, spent the next 3 years single.....for the first time honestly.  I was 34 now and felt emotionally ready.  I got involved with someone who was kind and attractive but from the beginning I thought he was kind of dumb.  I just couldn't connect with him intellectually.  Still I thought there must be some way to make this work because I think I associated relationships with personal compromise.  Not the.....\"I'll do the dishes if you cook\" but the kind of compromise where you know you are ignoring something that really bothers you.  I started seeing a therapist at that point and started to unravel a lot of bad patterns from my past.  The relationship ended badly but I was somewhat relieved that I had put on the brakes and stood up for my needs. In a lot of ways I feel programmed not to do that.  It took months with my therapist for me to even be able to confidently say what I wanted.  I am so used to being the negotiator, the compromiser.  I think that's what so many of us had to be to survive the Narcs in our childhood.  I didn't even know how to state my needs and stand up for myself.  No apologies, no explanations, just being ok with saying, \"This is what I want.\"\n\nEarlier this year I met a man who truly swept me off my feet.  I felt good, I had been through months of therapy and really felt confident.  The first 6 weeks of our time together were just amazing.  This person was handsome, smart, quirky, interesting and I quickly found myself falling in love.  The sex was amazing and he wanted to see me all the time.  It was everything I had been looking for.  That is until I told him that I was falling in love with him.....and the N realized he had caught me.  Everything changed and you know the drill.  The love-bombing, the gaslighting, the subtle insults, it was all there right in front of me.  I recognized what he was and went strictly no contact and have been since.  I don't want this person back and I feel no love for him now.  The person I loved was an illusion and that's a tough pill to swallow.  However I was frustrated that, again, I had let a Narcissist into my life. The silver lining was this experience sent me back to my therapist where we started talking about this pattern.  How is it that a smart, attractive 36 year old gets involved with someone so blatantly narcissist......and why does it keep happening?  This lead to a lot of discussion about my childhood and the realization that.......that's what I'm familiar with.\n\nI don't really know what it's like to be in a healthy, loving relationship. I am afraid that I don't even know what that feels like.  I am still dating but I am so cautious now that most of the time I don't go out on second dates.  In a way I think this is a good thing.  I know what I want and have learned to trust my gut. I think, at this point, I could spot an N a mile away so at least I have that comfort.  However......I feel like I wouldn't know what to do with a healthy guy if I had him.  Has anyone else felt this way?  Any tips or advice would be appreciated!",

I don't know if my story is in the right place here, but I figured it's worth a shot.\n\nI lived with my narcissistic grandmother for the first half of my life. It impacts me in adulthood and affects every relationship I have and have had in the past. As a child, I took everything she said to heart and her words were devastating. Illogical criticisms still float around in my head and make me question nearly everything I do while trying to maintain a false image to everyone else around me. As I got older, I began to fight back and understood that her insults and manipulative behaviors were unhealthy and not normal.\n\nI went to college in another state, almost entirely to get away from her. I visited home every few weeks but her attacks were generally only during longer stays, through email, or by controlling things her way like turn my cell phone off when she felt like it. I got used to a world where I could live with her abuse from afar and fighting back, in a way, gave me a strength and false confidence (even if I didn't \"win.\") I know now that I really was just feeding the fire, but I didn't really know any better. Fighting back was better than just taking the abuse.\n\nAnd then over Skype my mom told me that my grandmother had brain and lung cancer. I don't remember much else from the call. My mother lived with this woman before I did, and suffered what I had and possibly more. In another time, it was \"normal,\" and to her it still sort of is. I had to be strong for her, I don't remember showing emotion during that call.\n\nI never saw her alive again. I came down for a holiday to visit and she passed away during my flight. I remember crying after I left the house, but I don't think I was sad. I don't really know what I felt.\n\nI don't feel like I had any closure. One day she was clutching onto every aspect of my life, and the next day she no longer exists. This was years ago, and I still have a very, very hard time trusting people, allowing loved ones to take care of me, and feeling comfortable with myself. I am so self critical and obsess over the same stupid things. I can't imagine a planet where someone loves me and doesn't have something they want after they tell me that.",

He was never diagnosed with NPD, but after reading up on it after our messy breakup, it matched him to a \"T\". He was possessive, manipulative, emotionally abusive and made me feel lower than dirt.. I was mentally very damaged after finally breaking up with him (which took multiple tries..), but have definitely made a huge recovery since then. It's been a while since the breakup and total no-contact with him and I finally healed enough and have found a really sweet guy who I just started dating.\n\nMy ex was the first person I dated so I don't really have a baseline of what a healthy relationship should be like. I don't want to bring any of the bad habits or sh*tty ways of communicating from my ex into the new relationship. Are their any books on this subject or any articles that anyone could recommend to help me get a baseline for healthy behavior in a relationship (or even just personal advice)? I know this is asking a lot, since it's a broad subject, but I anything would be helpful at this point!",

        "text": "I grew up with a narcissistic family and once joined a doomsday cult. (Seriously.) But believe it or not, those people didn't fuck me up half as bad as this guy I met in college who I'll call Dracula (because the name fits). \"Dracula\" was a malignant narcissist who tortured me for years.\n\nI call him an Nex for sake of ease, but to be honest, we officially dated once, and that was only for a month before I couldn't take the lying anymore. Dracula was like Mr. Big on Sex &amp; the City. The whirlwind romance guy who could charm the pants off the devil but never commit to you. \n\nHe breezed in and out of my life for years and left a tornado wreck in his wake. Lying, manipulation, all types of abuse, triangulating me against other women (and there were always other women). He'd woo me to the point where I thought we were getting somewhere, only to drop me and vanish as if he'd been abducted by a government black ops team. If I got sick of his abuse and tried to leave first, he'd scream, stalk and smear me to everyone I knew.\n\nA few highlights of what he did:\n\n* spread revenge porn of an ex-girlfriend who pissed him off (not me, thank God)\n* broke into a hated professor's office to have sex on their desk (also not me)\n* impersonated a police officer\n* [wrote me these emails during a week he decided he hated me](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/2hrgyv/i_didnt_realize_my_ex_was_an_n_until_i_got_these/)\n\nThe full list would be a book, but I'm sure you can imagine the rest. \n\nI really think the guy was a sociopath. At least my family were apologetic for being broken, dysfunctional people. Dracula actually took pleasure in hurting others. People on campus called him \"the prince of darkness\" behind his back, which should have been a clue to 18-year old me that this was a guy to drop like a hot potato.\n\nI went no contact with Dracula five years ago after he stood me up for coffee with another stupid excuse that I knew was a lie (\"My grandma's sick!\"). It sounds like such a silly thing to cut someone off over, but it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I finally realized he never respected me and decided I was done. I moved on.\n\nDracula's abuse had derailed my life. I spent most of my twenties just surviving: waiting tables, bartending, hopping from job to job, couch surfing with friends. I never had more than $50 in the bank, and I had zero self-esteem. I honestly don't know how I didn't kill myself. At one point, a psychologist diagnosed me with the worst PTSD she'd ever seen.\n\nBut as soon as I cut Dracula off, my life instantly became better. I spent the next few years reading every business book I could get my hands on and networking my ass off. I started a few businesses that failed, then finally started one that did well. I learned a ton.\n\nIt paid off. This week I got two amazing job offers. The job I picked reports directly to the CEO, and he is so excited I'm coming to work with him. I feel so respected and valued, and I can now say I'm going to make a lucrative living as a writer.\n\nInterestingly, Dracula was rejected from every PhD program to which he applied. His blog got zero traffic, so he had to shut that down. He's failed to become a successful writer, and his wife had to get him a cubicle job at her company when his fledgling journalism career fell apart. In hindsight, it's obvious that he was a jealous person and that even his criticisms of me were pure projection. He never knew me at all.\n\nAnyway I share all this because I guess I had it in me all along, even when I was homeless and traumatized. Also, the best revenge truly is living well. I don't think about Dracula much nowadays. I've realized the opposite of love isn't hate, it's indifference.",

        "text": "So a little back story. I have/had this friend who I've known for the last 10 years. She's about 6 years younger than me but we've always been pretty close. We've been there for each other's weddings, my pregnancies, new jobs etc.. She and her husband were in our inner circle of friends. \n\nFast forward to a year ago July. That's the last time I saw them socially. My husband and I brought home gifts for them from Europe. We hung out and had a great time. Everything was normal. I found out I was pregnant with my daughter come September. Now it would be normal for us to go long periods of time with out talking outside of fb or seeing each other bc we all work and have crazy lives. That November I was at the mall and saw her and her dad. I said \"omg friend! I haven't seen you in ages. I was just thinking about you!\" I had felt bad for not seeing her but the first trimester kicked my ass. She looked startled and said \"oh hi. Yea I know\". I started to respond and she literally turned her back to me and started talking to her dad about some price of jewelry in the near by store that caught her attention. She completely ignored me as I tried to get her attention. Now me being social awkward sometimes, I figured it was me and walked off. I sent her a fb message asking what was up and she denied that any thing was wrong. She said she was just going through some stuff. \n\nIt was weird bc she normally would tell me since we were close. I didn't sleep for days bc I was so upset. I went over everything as to why the sudden shift. All I could come up with was that I was pregnant. She's wanted a baby as long as I could remember and was finally married with a stable job and she was having trouble conceiving. All I could figure was that my pregnancy was hard for her. WHICH I TOTALLY GET.  And I wish she would have just told me that if it was the case. It would hurt but I'd get and respect it. \n\nSo fast forward. I gave her space but his her from my fb bc it hurt. My baby came in May and I had hoped she would reach out after things settled down. My birthday was in June and she didn't wish me a happy birthday. I let that go. Still nothing and my daughter is 3 mo old. Today is her birthday and I've decided to not wish her a happy one because I would only be doing it to check off the \"I'm a good friend\" box when really I'm just hurt. \n\nSo at this point to I just cut my losses and unfriend her (&amp;amp; her husband and family?)? I check all the time to see if she has unfriended me. She's made it clear that I'm not a priority in her life or even her friend. I really just want an answer. I'm tempted to send a message saying \"I'm really hurt. Idk why you ghosted me but I have to walk away. The door is open if you want to talk about it and try again\".  I'm trying to show compassion but I'm also doing all the work. I don't want to just make blanket decisions. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "My stepmom was my best friend and person I had told everything to for eight years. I thought she was the best person ever. We made Halloween costumes together, she got me a dog, she bought me anything, she was the only adult person I was close to. \n\nThen I grew up. For years I had been sent to therapist after therapist, being told I had adhd or I was depressed or I was just really messed up. I never knew why I was there. I was always told that it was because of my parents' divorce and that's why I was such a terrible child. Each time I went to a new therapist I was told that the last one just \"didn't work out\" or they were \"making me uncomfortable\" (which, I had not said). And each time I went to a new one they tried to get my step mom to go into counseling. Each time she refused, and mysteriously I had a problem with this therapist. \n\nFlip a few years forward, I'm about thirteen and I'm talking to my mom one night (I had been pretty distanced from her because my step mom had told me terrible things about her) and she says something that made me really question my step mom's accuracy when telling me things and intentions. I finally realized that for eight years she had told me all sorts of terrible things about my mom, or my step dad, or my dad's family, and none of it was true. That moment was a very serious and heartbreaking realization for someone who is very trusting and very emotional. \n\nFrom then on I faked it. I went along with whatever she wanted for a while, pretending like nothing was different. Then, after about a year I couldn't do it. I slowly hid in my room more and more, withdrawing from friends and family, not really doing much of anything outside of school. That led to a series of not great things, like depression and losing most of my friends. \nAfter a while, being hidden in my room while the people around me continued to live their lives like normal felt like routine. I didn't have to do much, and I was getting by. \n\nAt about sixteen I decided that I wanted to leave my father's house completely. But, being sixteen, I couldn't just leave peacefully. I tried to voice that I wanted to live with my mom, and that went over about as smooth as anyone would expect. It ended in tears and fighting and me eventually giving in because I didn't know what else to do. My step mom twisted my words and my memories (of even the last five minutes) that I had no choice but to tell her what she wanted to hear. She told me that if I wanted to leave I would have to get a lawyer and go to court. Which I was not prepared to do, and being completely drained by the end of the experience, I just let it go. \n\nSo, a couple years later (this year, around May) I decided that I could not live in an environment where I had to see my father be pushed around, my half siblings do whatever they want to and never get in trouble, and barely be treated like a human (not directly of course, but it was there). \nOne night, I had had enough. I told my father that I would be leaving soon and that I was sorry but I had to. (Of course he immediately went and got my step mom.) I tried to be nice about it and told him it was just too much to split my time half and half with my two \"families\" (which it was, it just wasn't the whole reason). So later on in the evening my step mom comes home and she tucks her little angels into bed and sings to them and yada yada. Then I hear \"plud plud plud\" down the stairs. I knew what was coming. \n\nShe storms into my room. Threw open the door, stared at me (I was doing homework), and just sits in my chair at my desk. I continued to do homework for an hour. She continued to sit and stare at me. I finished my homework and she just goes \"so your father is really upset\". I just stared. \nShe continues with \"we just don't know where this is coming from? This is so sudden!\" (As she always claims because she doesn't pay attention unless it effects her). So her games of \"oh boo hoo me I'm so sad you're breaking my heart blah blah blah cry cry\" go on for two hours. I'm crying  by the end of it, and she thinks it's because she's gotten to me and she's \"won\". I had been practically plotting her death by the point that I finally said. \"I have to go to bed. Leave.\" The look of loosely masked anger while trying to look pathetic was hilarious. I actually laughed as she walked out the door. She knew she had lost, but before she left she calmly added \"we will talk about this tomorrow.\"\n\nBy the time she came home the next day I was gone. \n\n_________________________________\n\nSo that's my story, sorry it's so long. There's so much more to it, but that's the general idea of what happened. Someone referred me to this subreddit and I was so thankful to finally have a word for what she was. And it's heartbreaking but wonderful to know I'm not alone in this experience.\n\nI just wanted to know if anyone had any advice for completely rebuilding yourself and personality because I'm a bit lost?

        "text": "My first two years as an undergrad have been really rough. I actually loved school and functioned super well in highschool / around my Nfamily, but I've had serious trouble adjusting to not being scared all the time and dealing with normal people. I find myself in situations which reveal to me just how bad my Nfamily was. At best, that's a lot of extra shit to think about, which slows me down at random times.\n\nSchool used to be my escape. Puzzles are my favorite thing in the world, and school was a steady source of puzzles. However, I've found that in college, a lot of my homework isn't creative, and my professors don't seem to want to answer any theoretical questions that I ask. For instance, my discrete math class mentioned [Ramsey numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem#Ramsey_numbers) when we were talking about nodes and graphs. I was absolutely thrilled and read up a bunch and came back to class the next week with a question about one of the papers that I'd read. I was the first person in line for office hours, asked my question very politely, and had pre-prepared everything to ask my question as efficiently as possible, but the professor just said, \"That's outside the scope of the course. Next person, please.\" I blanched and then asked again a bit differently, and then tried to ask if there was a better place to ask my question- I don't think that I wasn't being assertive enough here. But in any case, that's a fairly representative scenario which largely sums up my experiences as an undergrad.\n\nDespite all of this, I've managed maintain about a 3.0 in a very respectable computer science program, but I've been both really discouraged by school itself, and had massive anxiety issues. I was prescribed anti-anxiety medication a couple months ago -so I'm hoping that the next semester goes a bit better- but I'm terrified that I've mucked up my chances to get into a halfway-decent grad school or PhD program. My current university isn't Ivy League or anything, but it's still supposed to be a very good program. Of course, I just want to get into the best program that I can for intrinsic reasons, but I'm also scared that if I don't get into a program that's at least as highly-ranked as my current program, then I'll have even more negative experiences with school.\n\nI could probably get some leeway with my personal history / admittedly rather debilitating anxiety issues, but I still feel like I don't have any shot, and that I'd just be desperately grasping for straws by playing the pity card in my applications. I'm no good at manipulating people (the very thought is anathema to me, and I've therefore had very little practice), but I feel like if I were to mention my personal history, I'd have to be very careful and calculating about the impression that I made. Growing up, I made a point of hiding my N-family from teachers, counselors, etc.: If I admitted how bad my N-family to some adult/authority figure, they might not act quickly enough in removing me from my situation and my N-family might have the chance to retaliate. Combined with the fact that I've been highly-independent from a young age, it has never seemed like a good idea to risk my self-provisioned stability.\n\nIn short, I haven't ever told an adult/authority figure about what happened to me growing up, and I have no idea how to do that, or whether it would even help me when applying for higher education, given that my GPA is so low.\n\nI'm not sure if my self-evaluation of my chances of eventually getting a PhD are clouded by N-nastiness, especially considering that my calculations for my undergrad admissions were spot-on. But I nevertheless suspect that raisedbynormal people have some internal sense that they can do things if they have a bit of luck and work really hard. I can't tell if my self-perceptions here are biased towards inaccuracy, due perhaps to a lack of encouragement.\n\nStudying abstract mathematics and computer theory sounds like the most wonderful thing that I could possibly do with my life, and I'd love to do that in a formal setting with other nerds, but I'm not sure if I have access to such a formal setting. I find it terribly distressing that I could have managed to escaped my N-family, only to screw up my shot at doing creative theory work: my fear of poor past performance applies to job applications as well. I'd love to work at google or perhaps an artificial intelligence thinktank, but I just have the overwhelming feeling that I'm not allowed to do any of the above because of how much I've messed up.",

        "text": "It feels as though I've told it over one thousand times since Spring of 2015, but this morning something \"clicked\" in my head (finally) and after feeling as though I was stuck in a plateau for a bit, I can once again feel myself continuing to heal. \n\nI met my ex husband online in 2008. He was very charming, said all the right things, had me swooning on day #1. I was only nineteen years old and I wanted to \"grow up\" so badly. I wanted to get away from my home life and just...be free. But I took the worst escape route possible and fell for a handful of well placed words that were only strung together to convince me that this was a good idea. That he could \"save\" me somehow.\n\nOne month later we were engaged.  \n\nHe brought it up before our wedding...the idea of \"swinging\", something I had been unfamiliar with. I was immediately against it. It wasn't that I thought it was \"bad\", it's just not something someone like me is wired for. Yet no matter how many times I said \"no\", he'd weave a little web of bullshit to try to convince me.\n\nEventually I gave in. I can't remember why. Honestly, I think it was mostly due to no self esteem and an intense fear of being left alone. That coupled with him using my molestation as a reason I was \"afraid\" of swinging...I told him about it because I felt safe. I was only 6-7 when it happened, and it happened repeatedly. I was young and didn't realize it at the time, but someone using past abuse as a reason you should do something you absolutely do not want to do is a fucking horrifying sign. \n\nAs time went on I began to lose whatever fight I had inside of me. He emotionally manipulated me constantly. I grew distant from my friends and family and I gained a lot of weight. After a few years I was convinced that the only reason any male ever wanted to speak to me was because they wanted to fuck me. That even my friends from high school didn't REALLY care about me, they just wanted to get in my pants. \n\nHe would ask me to talk to other men on the internet because it \"turned him on\" and I'd be lying if I said the attention didn't do something for me. Not so much sexually as it did emotionally...just feeling wanted was better than focusing on my reality. My self worth was now based almost solely in sex. Not even sex that I really wanted...sex that I knew would keep him quiet for a few moments. \"Like ripping a band-aid off\". If I just got it over with, maybe we could be a couple for a little while. Just us. \n\nBut there was never any \"just us\". \n\nI stayed with this person for seven years. One year dating, six year married. \n\nI had been interested in someone else for two years, but we never spoke outside of work. No matter what my ex had done to me (cheating, flirting with my sister on facebook, etc. etc.), I knew what would happen if I exchanged numbers with this person and I could not do that to my husband. \n\nLoyal to a fault, I guess.\n\nBut eventually I left that job, and the day I put in my two weeks notice I asked for that persons phone number. \nAnd then I left. \n\nPart of me always knew I'd leave my ex eventually. I think quitting my job for something better made me realize I could do that in all aspects...that as much as I wanted to somehow make things work, it was impossible. I would spend my entire life being made to feel less than human. Being lied to, cheated on, manipulated...he was a sick man and was not going to change for me. \n\nI had left once before with only minor incidences. A few comments on photos of me and my best friend that read \"these two are whores\" or something like that. I went back to him after only a few days.\n\nThis time it was permanent. And the shit storm that followed was far worse than a few childish photo comments. \n\nWhen he found out that I began seeing my former coworker, I think it clicked that I wasn't going to fall for his manipulative bullshit anymore...and he flipped. \n\nHe said people told him that I'd been seeing my coworker for six months even though my ex would pick me up from work every day because we only had one car. He threatened his children and called our workplace to tell the manager we were having sex. He randomly sent me a text with just my coworkers address. I was working near our apartment at the time and one afternoon he sent me a text saying he knew I was with my former coworker because he didn't see my car outside at work (I had parked in back, not that it matters). \n\nThis coming from a man who tried to sleep with my former best friend shortly after our wedding. Who fucked around with my cousin's roommate while me and my cousin were watching a movie downstairs. This coming from a person who, when we got home from our honeymoon, screamed at me because one of us accidentally packed his step dad's keys and he believed I had somehow cheated on him. \"WHO'S KEYS ARE THESE?!?!?\", he yelled. We were in the same state at the same time. We hadn't been apart. It made no sense at all for him to accuse me...and I didn't understand. \n\nThe day I left I went to call my parents and he took my phone. I grabbed for it, yelling \"HELP\", and accidentally scratched him. He swore he would call the cops and tell them I abused him because of that. \n\nIt's been over one year, and I am happier than I've been in decades. I am in a healthy relationship with someone who is very patient and understanding of my anxiety...which skyrocketed when I left my marriage. I am close with my family again and recently met my boyfriends family and they were all wonderful. \n\nI struggle a lot with paranoia and anxiety, but I'm always getting better. Little by little. The experience definitely opened my eyes to \"invisible\" abuse and just how dangerous and damaging a narcissist can be. I was no saint, but I did try, and if anything I'm very grateful that the lessons I learned can be applied to my present relationships. \n\nMy life took a complete 180 the day I walked out that door. \nThere is definitely hope and it's comforting to know that I am not alone in this. \n\nIf you've read this little essay, thank you. I'm a bit afraid because my ex does use reddit (I even made a new username), but if someone who feels trapped reads this and maybe sees that they can leave...that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and people love you and want you to be safe...",

And of course he didn't come get her.). I then hear toddler going \"mommy. Mommy\" and then something else I couldn't make out. I was like \"great he's starting to wake up\". My husband listened and heard nothing after his shower. As soon as my husband walks out the door, I hear my toddler again. I'm thinking \"what's with both kids waiting until daddy leaves/is busy and mommy needs sleep?\"  I tell him, from my room, \"it's way too early, go back to bed.\" But then I hear nothing and i knew his ankle hurt him (he twisted it yesterday playing) so I got up to check on him. \n\nHe was sound asleep in his bed. Didn't even move when I opened the door 😳 i was seriously freaked out and exhausted. Thought I was hearing voices that weren't there. Maybe there was a demon in my house miming the sound of my kid. So I text my husband and try to go back to sleep thinking I'm either crazy or my house is possessed. I then wake up to a rational text from my husband telling me he was probably just talking in his sleep 😳😂😁 mommy needs coffee!!!\n\nI share this here (&amp; I'll probably share this on the mom subs) because the fact that he called out for ME in his sleep- not my husband. That truly is a healing, remarkable thing. At the time I was annoyed bc of my sleep deprivation, but now that I'm up for real and able to think about it, it just warms my heart that he wanted me. That he feels safe and moved enough by me that he wants me. That's a good way to start of my morning! And you know...no demons. Haha!",

I also leveled up in last two weeks (I cry a lot when I level up).\n\nBack in May I planned this summer to stay in four cities, two weeks in each because I do some work while I travel. First two weeks were above average. I felt still quite anxious but I did my best. I got a small tattoo, red pilcrow, because it makes more sense to me to get a tattoo which reminds me that everyday I can write a positive paragraph in my life than getting a semi colon.\n\nIn the third city I got two piercings, first on the second day and second on the last day. The first one triggered a lot of memories and emotions because my mother used to be obsessed with my acne and the piercer was first person to touch my face in couple of years.\n\nGetting it wasn't painless because I am idiot who wants dermal in a quite tight spot so it took couple of tries before she put it in place. During that I felt safe. Partly because I knew that she would stop if I said that I've had enough and partly because I knew that in worst case scenario I could push her away and not fear of being homeless.\n\nYesterday I came to the third city. To be honest I don't like it all. This isn't the cheapest place which I have rented but so far it's my least favorite because it requires me to spend a lot of energy to go to bathroom and kitchen. I knew that bathroom, not kitchen, is in another building but when I rented private room I didn't expect camping infrastructure.\n\nIt reminds me of the second Airbnb place which I visited two years ago where I had problems dealing with my flashbacks from the times when I lived on campus. I feel beginning of a depression. Everything is difficult and there is nothing in particular that I want to see or attend. When I realized this morning that I forgot to take my meds yesterday I looked for a different place elsewhere. Tomorrow I am leaving for a place where I will be alone for a decent price.\n\nAfter six months of travel and sharing spaces with other people being alone will be great for my aspire traits. Now I need to do some work.\n\nI am happy with my progress.",

Most of the work I've done this year is on repairing my own personal boundaries and I keep going back and forth between super strict boundaries or being too lax. Having trouble finding the right place between the two. Hoping for some input on how someone with good interpersonal boundaries would have handled the following situation. \n\nEarlier this summer, a large tree branch fell on the fence between my neighbor's yard and my yard. The fence belongs to neighbor and she told me she planned to fix it soon and would give me a couple days' notice since the people repairing it would need access to my yard. My yard is fenced all around with a gate on one side which cannot be locked, only latched for various reasons. Weeks went by and fence was still not fixed. I found it vaguely annoying, but not enough to say anything about it. The kids from each family (mine and neighbor's) played in our respective yards and didn't bother the holes in the fence, so no real harm. \n\nOne day about a month later, I came home from a walk one morning to someone I didn't know in my backyard. My anxiety went into overdrive, I confronted the man who told me he was just fixing the fence. I checked my phone right away to see if I had missed some a call or text from neighbor, but there was nothing. A few minutes later, I got a phone call from neighbor \"Hey, sorry, hope we didn't scare you. Guys came to fix the fence a day early and I was on the phone, couldn't call you when they got here.\" Here's where I'm afraid I caved on my boundaries - she said she'd give us a couple days' notice, clearly she knew they were coming ahead of time, and yet I had heard nothing from her. Neighbor is assertive to the point of aggressive and I'd like to maintain a civil relationship with her, but I did want her to know that this bothered me - don't let people into my yard without telling me. (Side note: same neighbor let NMom into my yard to \"look in the windows\" while we were in the process of buying the house.) I ended up saying something like \"It's ok, I understand, please let us know in the future.\" Came home later in the afternoon to another repairman in my backyard, no notice from neighbor. \n\nHow can I handle situations like this better in the future?

They are awesome people, but that doesn't stop anxiety from dripping into my mind. Early this morning my fiance's step dad was up doing laundry and being very loud (the laundry room is next to our bedroom). I almost jumped out of my skin when I heard the banging, because when I lived at home my mom would bang dishes and slam the washing machine door repeatedly early in the morning to try to wake us up. When I would get up and ask her why she feels like she needs to be that loud at 7 am she would deny that she was being loud at all. Then that would turn into her yelling about how she does so much housework and that my sister and I never help at all (which is a complete lie). I laid in bed this morning and cried, because I just couldn't shake the feeling that she was in the next room.\n\nI know that she can't get me here, but I can't shake the feeling of panic when episodes like that occur. Usually when they happen I feel anxious all day and I just have to ride the feeling out. They have been happening more lately since we moved. \n\nA few days ago my guy and I were hiking Stone Mountain and I had an anxiety attack halfway up the mountain because my blood glucose was going down (I'm a type one diabetic. Have been since I was 7 and I'm 25 now) . In my mind I was so sure that I was going to die on that mountain side. I was going to die right after I finally got far away from my mother. After it was all over I felt like I was COMPLETELY INSANE. I feel so out of control right now. I moved out seven years ago and the attacks are intensifying.  It's as if the farther I get from my mom the more intense the anxiety attacks. \n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? Any anxiety management techniques you can recommend? ",

Sure I had boyfriends before but I wouldn't consider them serious or long term. His name was Jeremy and he loved me. \n\nShortly before meeting Jeremy I had gone through the summer of hell with the N-mom. I was just out of my freshman year of college (which was also hellish due to N-mom). Now N-mom at the time lived in another country due to stepdads work. She had lorded over my head that she wouldn't continue paying for school if I didn't agree to her demands, which were to only follow her schedule for my summer. She wanted me to get out school and travel the entire summer to visit family in another state and then spend the last month in other country with her. I was not up for this plan. Not only did I not want my summer dictated by her but the thought of spending a month in a foreign country sounded like a terrible idea especially after all she put me through freshman year during school. I went to visit family and continued to have her phone calls haunt me, both while she was sober and not. I must mention here that N-mom is also an alcoholic (not in her mind of course). As the summer went on I felt more and more adamant that going to other country was BAD. I couldn't do it. So I called her and told her I was going back home, I wasn't coming to see her. She wrote me off, refused to pay for school and said good luck on your own without me. \n\nSo now I was back home. Couch-surfing and living out of my car. A friend and I got a place together and I tried to get my life together. Then I met Jeremy. We hit it off immediately and never looked back. Before long we were living together. He was in school and I was working full time. I met his parents, they were amazing. Now at the time I was aware N-mom had her issues, but was unaware of narcissism as a mindset or the many mind fucked spells I was under. Yes her behavior was disgusting but she was my mom. And I wouldn't realize until much later just how much my head was twisted. \n\nNow Jeremy came from a completely different background. His parents were still together. He grew up in a loving and supportive home. He called his parents because he wanted to. Not out of obligation. This was fascinating to me. I loved his parents and they loved me. They remembered things I liked, were interested in my thoughts and ideas and were concerned about my wellbeing. They called me on my birthday. When his dad called and sang me Happy Birthday over the phone I sobbed. They took me out to dinner and bought me a beautiful bracelet from a local artist they knew I loved. When I cried at dinner his dad asked if I was ok. I told him I was surprised he called me and sang and bought me such a thoughtful gift. He said \"We love you like a daughter and that's what parents do.\" I tried not to sob harder and said, \"Not all parents. My mother didn't even contact me.\" The look on his face still brings me to tears when I think about it. \n\nAs my relationship with Jeremy continued I had sporadic contact with N-mom. She had her separate life in another country without me and she seemed fine with that. She never once met Jeremy or his parents, even after it was very clear we were serious. I began to realize that my upbringing was a huge obstacle in my serious relationship. There were times when I would be upset over things and Jeremy just couldn't wrap his head around them. I tried to explain that I felt this way because of certain aspects of my childhood or life with N-mom but he never fully understood. His upbringing was so different that he couldn't understand how someone could be so fucked up by their parents. Sometimes instead of empathy I got frustration from him. It was a contentious part of our relationship. \n\nThat's when I first began to realize that my childhood was a much bigger problem than I could have imagined. It shaped me in a way that left me misunderstood and cut off from so many people. It made my emotions unstable and irrational at times. It left me with a hole inside myself that I didn't know how to reconcile or deal with. \n\nJeremy and I did not end up married despite getting engaged and being together for 4 years. We had other issues than my N-mom mindfucks. The hardest part of breaking up however was losing contact with his parents. That tore me up more than the breakup to be honest. But I am grateful in a way that our relationship ran the course it did. It opened my eyes and began my many year journey to self realization and healing. It would definitely be a hard and fucked up road but the journey needed to start somewhere. Again, one day I will share my full story, there is so much more to tell. For now I just needed to share this story that has been weighing on me. \n\n\n\n",

Maybe one day I'll tell my story but for now I just want to share a realization I had and see if anyone else can relate. \n\nI received a Facebook message from an old friend of mine. We haven't spoken in a couple years, we live far away from each other and just lost contact. Well she said, \"Thought about you the other day! I hope you are well! I know we haven't talked in awhile but I would love to catch up sometime!\" Seems innocent enough but it really threw me for a loop. I was genuinely surprised that she thought of me after years. Then I realized that I think that a lot.  I see people pop up on my Facebook as people I may know. Some are old coworkers or old school friends but I never friend request them because I always assume they won't remember me or won't want to be my friend. I have this feeling constantly that if I'm not around then people don't think about me. Like I don't exist. In my head I'm not memorable or important enough to be thought about when I am not in someone's life constantly. \n\nI really sat down and made myself reflect on this and I feel it comes from the N-mom. She only needed me when she wanted something or needed her N-fix. And if she didn't want something then it was like I wasn't there or didn't matter. \n\nAnyone else relate? It kind of made me sad but I'm hoping to work through it and overcome this obstacle. ",

There are a lot of fundamental differences, but this one is kind of overarching and I was curious if others have noticed it as well.  \n  \nWith my Nex, I never felt like he was fully engaged with other people at any given time. He was there, but not completely. With friends, he would talk and often dominate conversation, but it still felt like he was separate from others. With me, I would talk to him and he would sometimes pay attention, but not always. He never wanted to go places or do things with me unless they specifically interested him. With our child, he'd hold him sometimes while doing other things, but that's about it. Even in the bedroom, it was like he was having sex on me, not with me.  \n  \nBut with my SO, it's like he's always engaged in the situation. Sure, sometimes he's tired and zones out like any person, but most of the time he's actively involved. I feel like I actually share experiences with him. With my child, he makes an effort to do things just with him, and just gives him his full attention sometimes.  \n  \n  \nIf I had to boil it down and explain this, I think it could be asserted that N's are too selfish to ever fully give themselves to any situation, especially at the benefit of others. They're so stuck in their own worlds that they don't step into the world's of others.  \n  \nI wanted to see what others thought about this idea. Thanks for reading and sharing. ",

I don't think I was in there for long but I'm not sure because black holes distort time. \n\nIt's full of the feelings I had when I was a child. Awful feelings about who I am, all the stuff buried inside of me. It's like the depths of hell in there.

It's unimaginably desolate and excruciatingly painful.\n\nMy boyfriend found me and grabbed my hand as I was falling and kept hold of me while I was flailing around in the dark.

Showered and dressed. Went outside for a short walk with my boyfriend. We did some chores to keep the house manageable. I feel sick but ate some fruit and took my meds. Boyfriend has fallen asleep now because he's jetlagged. I feel lonely and pointless.",

People keep telling me I can't have interviewed badly if I got the job, but I know it could have gone much better. \n\nAs a result, I've been ruminating on the interview and am feeling like they made a mistake and will find me out. I know I'm actually capable of doing the job and I'm pleased they think so too, but I have imposter syndrome. And while lots of non-ACONs get that, I think the experience isn't necessarily the same. \n\nOne thing that's helping me is to think well yes I could have done better in the interview but they still wanted me. So it's irrational to have imposter syndrome when I've been hired on the basis of what I think was a bad interview. That makes me less of an imposter. \n\nI'm also thinking about what will help me get confident and excited for day one - getting some nice new clothes for example. And I'm writing a new resume just for me with my new position so I can feel proud of where I'm at. \n\nI'm trying to think of other ways to let myself be happy and excited and not self-sabotage and would hugely appreciate any suggestions or tips. **However, please don't post anything about gratitude, eg gratitude journals, as this is triggering for me.** It's also counter-productive as my problem is feeling overly grateful and undeserving!

But I found myself brooding over the very short moment for nearly two days after the incident.

I tried to act like normal, but that terrible little voice inside kept telling me that I was a terrible girlfriend and I don't deserve him.\n\nOver something that was so trivial, that didn't matter at all.

So logically, I repeated that in my own relationship...\n\nMy soon to be ex-husband and I were together for 13 years, married for 10. Although looking back, none of it was ever healthy, it really got very bad after we had our daughter.\n\nSimple things like making me apologize and beg for a hug in the middle of a panic attack, \"needing\" to go play hockey, even when our daughter was ill or in the hospital. Lying about stupid simple things. Lying to others where I could hear it, and telling me that he only lies to others, never to me... Making me lie for him at times. Almost missing the birth of his daughter (which was an emergency c-section, I was bleeding and had to take a taxi to the hospital alone, around midnight)... \n\nAnyway, I recently met someone and the chemistry was (is) amazing. \n\nExcept; turns out he's in a relationship and has an 11 month old daughter. I'm not monogamous, so that fact alone doesn't bother me, but the fact that he misrepresented the relationship does. He made me believe that they were just together for the child but had an agreement that they could see others. But if that's true, then he wouldn't have to worry about me texting him when he's with them, or her finding out about me etc.\n\nI almost fell for it again. Him saying \"I lie to her, but not to you, I promise...\"\n\nBut I didn't. I told him not to come over tonight, not even as \"just friends\". Cheating is cheating, it doesn't matter if you actually have sex or not.\n\nThe chemistry was amazing. I like him a lot. I'm in love (and lust). And yet, for basically the first time in my life I picked my own morals over what someone else wants to convince me to do.\n\nI picked what is best for me long run.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/4xdg34/an_article_on_boundaries/",
        "text": "Got this in my work email today. Sorry if the formatting is off-I'm on my phone. Wanted to share:\n---\n\nCreating boundaries\n\nBoundaries define things. Personal boundaries are the parameters of self. They include physical, emotional and mental limits that are created over time through life experiences. We all have unique preferences, thoughts, feelings, needs and emotions, making us unique in our boundary “blueprint.”\rBoundaries filter what is acceptable in our life and what is not, thereby protecting us from being manipulated, used, or violated by others. They are an essential piece to managing relationships.\rWe must take responsibility for how we allow others to treat us. Without protective and defining boundaries, there can be a tendency to derive self-worth from others. In order to create safety for oneself, it is important to determine personal limits, communicate the limits, and enforce the limits.\n\rFinding the Leaks:\rIf you find yourself having difficulty saying “no” to others because of guilt or obligation, you may have to do some work on creating boundaries. If you attempt to please others at your own expense, to the point that you are sacrificing on some level (financially, time, energy, health), then you are putting yourself last and are likely not remembering this key concept: Other people’s needs and feelings are not more important than our own! Other questions to ask yourself: Is your helping behavior something that they can do for themselves? Did they ask you to help, or are you crossing their boundaries and just helping because of your need to be needed?\rPoor boundaries can hurt relationships. Over helping does not help anyone in reality. The giver can become resentful, run down and physically ill, and it can lead to a cycle of being taken advantage of. The receiver does not learn to manage his/her own business or solve problems. Even when we think that we are helping this person for the final time, we are usually wrong. This can become a draining pattern that changes the nature of the relationship from genuine and enjoyable to dependence and expectations.\n\rEnter...Yes with Bookends!\rMastering the art of saying no is difficult. However, too many open ended yesses are like a leak that needs a plug. We are responsible for the leak and must find the plug! There is a way to say yes with limits, with what we will call “bookends.” Actual bookends provide structure to a row of books by putting a stop at each end. The same concept can be used in setting limits in relationships. Any time we give or allow of ourselves to others, there should be limits or bookends set. For example, a friend requests to do laundry at your house. This is a perfect place to insert limits or bookends to your availability. The friend can do his/her laundry at your place Wednesday and Friday nights from 7pm-10pm. The friend is now given a chance to problem solve and to respect your limitations. The friend may take you up on your offer or he/she may look for a better fitting solution. You are saying yes, with bookends! The bookends are crucial for safety in the relationship, as they allow the lines of respect to be maintained and neither party is forced to compromise. When you feel guilty, remember that not adding them holds the other person back from growing. Setting limits on how much and how you give is crucial in order to be fully engaged in relationships. The primary focus can be on the positive, emotional connection. Bookends keep our books and our relationships standing!\n\rBookends in Families: Control the Incoming!\rDo certain situations and/or people in your family cause a stress response (anger, frustration, resentment)? This could mean it is time to add some bookends in the relationship or situation. Helping family members can feel like an obligation. Obligations and expectations can lead to conflict. Managing family member needs are opportune places to add bookends and clear communication to maintain healthy family dynamics. For example, you dread seeing your mother’s phone number because she frequently calls throughout the week requesting you take her to the store. To remedy, insert a bookend! Propose the grocery store on Sundays after church, and other errands Tuesdays from 4pm-6pm. This way, everyone knows what to expect, stress decreases, and you gain quality time! Another example might be your adult son lives with you and expects you to babysit. Add the bookends! You can set limits on the amount of advance notice you need and the time period for which you are available. No party should sacrifice and the limits should be clear and easy to enforce.\r\n\nFamilies also come with communication. There are incoming phone calls and texts to manage. Do you respond at any time? Do you answer calls when you are doing important things? To stop the expectation that you are always available, incorporate periods of time where you are not available (phone in car, bag, or off). Other means of managing family communication can include turning off call alerts for select numbers so that you are not “alerted” for certain periods of time. You may also have a time window when you return family calls or a day that you call select family members. Maintaining control over the incoming communication lets you enjoy communicating with people whom you love.\n\rTricks of the Trade:\r1. Emotional reactions mean you may need a bookend.\r2. Add bookends even if they seem unnecessary.\r3. If you are caught off guard, remember, you can answer later!\r4. You do not owe an explanation for saying “no” or adding bookends, so there is no need to defend.\r5. Practice the saying, “That is not going to work for me.”\r6. People may have reactions when you start setting limits. They will adjust.\r7. Doing for someone what they can do for themselves is a lose/lose situation.\r8. Even though you have a phone, it doesn’t mean you are always available.\r9. Counseling can help with boundaries.\r10. Keeping boundaries means keeping enjoyable relationships!\r",

        "text": "Hi it's my first post here. Sorry if it's chaotic. Tried to keep it short. \n\nI've had no contact with my parents for 3 weeks now. Apart from my life getting generally happier (I moved abroad half a year ago and they don't know the address) the levels of guilt are raising in me. \n\nI visited them in June (was attending a friend's wedding) and told my BPD/N mother that my fiancés mom offered to buy my wedding dress, but I would like to buy it with my parents. She replied \"understandable she offered that, she has no daughters of her own\". I repeated I didn't agree to the offer and said I would look for some wedding salons we could go to together. \n\nI visited them with my fiancé in July. At some point she spread gossip that I have decided to buy a wedding dress with my fiancés mother and I \"have picked myself a new family\". My N father stopped talking to me at all and forced us (we're both past 25) to hide in my old room like children until we left to the airport.\n\nOn the day we were leaving, she woke up earlier than us, opened the door to our room without knocking and said \"oh I thought you were leaving Early!\", then as we were leaving, closed the gate so that one person had to go out to open it while she pushed the button.  She forced me to stay saying she \"wants to kiss me goodbye but is embarrassed by doing it in front of my boyfriend\". Then she held me by force and tried to puppy eye me (it's repulsive). I asked why she lied to everyone about the dress. She said \"not everyone, just your dad\". \n\nTriangulation at it's best. (She makes me sick And I'm sorry for her empty life) \n\nNext day I was chatting with my brother a little (he's 23, has lived with them his all life, has many N traits but a little bit of himself left. He's going to study abroad now, I'm secretly hoping he'll change). And she sends me photos of some purses in a style she likes, asking which one I want. I tell my brother about it and he says \"lol she spent all morning trying to convince me that you're jealous of all the stuff I get from them\". \n\nThey buy him brand clothes, expensive watch, they bought him a car and pay the petrol,an expensive computer, laptop, desk, etc. Everyone since I moved out to a different city to study they would give me barely any money to survive on and I would need to beg them for money to get myself copies of study books. But truth is, I feel so so much luckier for having been able to get out of there. I have no interest in money, it has always been a weapon of blackmail, you always had to beg for it, because she loves that, and eventually if you didn't care to any of her needs she would blame you for doing things only for the money. I stopped taking money from them as soon as I got my first, poorly paid job.\n\nI thanked for the purses (it was 23.07) and haven't spoken to them since.  But I know I will have to confront them, soon. 10.09 I and my N father are running a half marathon in Stockholm we signed up for together (at one of my weaker moments). Fiancés mom is running too, she asked if we could all have dinner together before the run. We were supposed to all find a hotel together. Also, my \"parents\" are staying a couple of days longer, to do some sightseeing. My father said my mother wanted that they stay at my place. I really don't want them to. \n\nPlus my wedding is going to be next year. My \"parents\" wanted to give me a large sum of money for it but I don't want it, because it will be used as blackmail later. Though last year when I was going to travel with back then my boyfriend (my \"parents\"  accidentally decided to go to the same place in the world a couple of weeks earlier) I didn't want the currency they had left over and they got super mad and offended. They still bring it up. \n\nI guess I'm just waiting for the first hit to come. I \"know\", I was \"taught\"  that as their child I'm supposed to be the one calling them, while they're busy because they're at work, or they're tired because they came back home from work. Always made me feel like I'm a bad boyfriend of a stereotypical woman. \"know my needs\", \"you should know by yourself \" and such.\n\nI'm feeling a bit trapped to be honest. I dread calling them, and I will feel disgusted with myself if I call them. At the same time, I won't feel so guilty, which is much more difficult to handle than self-disgust. \n\nDo you guys have any advice? Or similar problems? First time reaching out, I hope there is someone who's also fighting.",

        "text": "Hi LAN,\n\nI've had a lifelong battle with chronic back pain. Much of the time it's a manageable pain but I do get flare ups in which I can't stand up straight, it hurts to walk, and sciatic pain runs down my legs. My hips hurt most of the time. \n\nAs I said, this has been a lifelong problem and something that I complained about a lot growing up. My parents never really paid attention. They told me to exercise more, stop being lazy, and that it would be fine/stop being dramatic. I was never taken to a doctor and never had a thorough exam. When I was 20 the flare ups began and I sought out a doctor on my own. Unfortunately, that doctor didn’t really care and informed me that it was normal for a 20 year old to have back pain. She told me to take some Motrin and exercise more. (I’ll note that I was always resistant to exercising because it caused me a lot of pain. I did it anyway a lot of the time.) Which brings me to the present and the idea that the pain isn’t that bad and I just need to deal with it.\n\nHowever, in the last few weeks I had another flare up and decided to try going to a chiropractor for the first time. This particular practitioner did not do a good job, and I’m worried she actually injured me further. She did not ask about my history (obviously I have a trauma history since I’m RBN) and didn’t warn me before snapping my neck and back. It wasn’t a great experience and I won’t be going back. However, she did take some x-rays of my back and what do you know? I actually have a significant, very obvious problem.\n\nNot only do I have a very pronounced curvature in my back (lumbar scoliosis), but I have disc degeneration and the beginning of bone spurs along some of my vertebrae. All of this has been caused by a congenital deformation in my lumbar spine. Basically, I was born with a deformity and my spine has grown crookedly. I now have problems in my legs, hips, lower back, upper back, neck, and shoulders. \n\nI went to the doctor yesterday to get another opinion and it was clear to her, just with a brief manual exam, that my alignment from my hips to my shoulders is way off. She’s prescribed another round of PT for the recent flare up and referred me to a spine specialist to help me develop a plan since this will now require lifelong maintenance. \n\nAt home I did some research on the type of deformity I have and it actually seems quite serious. There are no good cures right now and the personal accounts basically said “Yeah, I live with chronic pain that meds can’t really touch. It’s degenerative and it’s getting worse.” I’m trying to stay hopeful that the spine specialist will be able to give me some other news.\n\nAnd how does this go back to my parents? Well, I complained about back pain from age 12 (at least), I always walked funny, I began to complain about severe knee pain at 16, my butt noticeably stuck out (bad hip alignment) for which they constantly made fun of me, I couldn’t get up from a seated position for nearly 4 months when I was 13 before they finally took me to an accupressurist to “fix” the problem. The list goes on and on. THEY DIDN’T TAKE CARE OF ME!\tThe clues were all there and they never had anyone look at my back. If they had I would likely not have scoliosis, degenerating discs, or massive pain right now because this process would have been caught and dealt with before it became a major problem. I mean, I guess it shouldn’t surprise me anymore that they really did neglect me, but today it still does and I’m so incredibly angry at them.\n\nSorry, this turned into a long rant. I’m still trying to process that I actually have a “valid” reason for being in so much pain and that they could have prevented a lot of it by doing what parents are supposed to do for their children. Fuck you, Nmom and Edad.",

I am stuck in the classic work-romance-gone-bad scenario. I am currently dealing with issues of seeing her constantly flirting with coworkers and feeling anger from seeing her laughing and having a great time (she is a narc afterall, and she likes to put on a show around the office). I get angry seeing these things because of the knowledge of all the bad things she’s done to people (lying, deceptions, etc). I think to myself: how does someone who has done such bad things get to act like that? She has a new boyfriend now, which I was happy about because it stopped her from constantly text-messaging me (classic NPD behavior), but I now see her consistently flirting with other men in the office and the other day I saw her leaving work with a male coworker. I have hours and hours of stories about her doing really bad things to people, and I have  a compulsion to tell these stories to coworkers, warning the men especially. I feel like I know a criminal, and by not saying anything, I’m doing a disservice to the community by not letting them know of the danger that lurks among them. Any advice? ",

        "text": "Hey all. So in January I \"ran away\" from my Nparents' house and moved all the way across the US. (I'm 28F, this was a long time coming.) I *finally* found a job and I start tomorrow afternoon. I'm not entirely clear on what this job entails but I know the company it's for and the kind of work they do so I'm confident it'll be fine. It's a bizarre 11PM-7AM shift but that's doable and I'm in the process of flipping my sleep schedule. It also pays significantly more than I've *ever* made. Intellectually, I'm really excited about it and pleased that I landed it.\n\nThe flip side is that my entire life no matter *what* job I've gotten it's always been \"shit\" and \"completely pointless\" and \"why don't you get a *real* job?!\" to the point where I get like immediate anxiety attacks about any and all jobs I've ever had not being \"good enough.\" Rationally I know this is nonsense. This job has a weird schedule but it's by no means a \"bad\" job.\n\nOn top of *that* the last actual job I had ended the first week of November last year after I had spent a solid week in a mental hospital because I had a complete meltdown over a combination of the shitty way they treated me at work, the prospect of quitting (i.e. \"failing like you always do at everything\") and crawling back to my Nparents' hell house, and the TV show I relied on for emotional balance narratively imploding and leaving me with nothing. That job was terrible, the whole situation was terrible, and it's like my brain still equates \"job\" with \"go shred your soul all day and get shit on for it.\"\n\nSo idk. Idk what I'm trying to say. This morning a friend of mine sent me a link to a local convention where the actress who plays my favorite character on the TV show would be in attendance and I had a full on panic attack at even the thought of going to the con. The day only got weirder from there and I can only conclude it's because I've got a jacked up headspace about starting this job/any job at all. I don't want to self-sabotage before I even start! And I keep telling myself that it doesn't have to be a forever thing. No job is a forever thing. But the programming in my head just like constantly insists that you shouldn't even *take* a job if it's not 2000% ideal. I realize now that that voice in my head was installed there so that I'd always be petrified to leave the Nrents. But, suckahs, I ran as far away as I could get just on the faith that the odds were pretty good I'd find something eventually.\n\nAnd I did.\n\nI'm gonna try to just be calm and open and compassionate to myself for the rest of the evening and then keep that mentality going into tomorrow, but I really need to find something that'll snap my anxiety attacks when they get extreme.",

        "text": "TL;DR because this post got really long: NMom is typical NMom, makes everything about herself including my PhD defense, finally got to say all the things I wanted to say, she makes that all about her feelings too, and now I'm accidentally NC and not sure how I feel about it. \n\nHi, I just found this sub, and I think this is where I need to be now that I'm far away from my NMom and accidentally NC with her. This is mostly a rant but I could use some input, too, from other people that are NC. \n\nIn November, I was offered a job that I really, really wanted... four states away from where I was living at the time. I was about an hour and a half from my mom then, and she was disappointed with the amount I had been visiting (last two years of grad school - did NOT have time to visit every weekend even if I wanted to). She was not particularly excited when I called her to tell her I had gotten the job. \"But have you heard anything from [college that is in the same city I was living in at the time]?\" I was still pretty angry about realizing my mom has NPD at this time. So when she \"casually\" tossed around the idea that she would move out to the midwest with me... well, I never directly told her no, but I certainly didn't tell her yes, and she got the idea. She began dropping comments into our conversations about how she's so alone and no one cares about her. I tried my best to ignore them. \n\nTwo weeks before I defend my PhD thesis, I ask her if she's coming and she says \"I don't know, I don't feel comfortable going where I'm not wanted.\" I told her obviously I wanted her there or I wouldn't be asking. She said she would \"think about it.\" I didn't know for sure she was coming until she showed up, even though I texted her the night before to ask if she was coming. It was like a switch. The most important day of my life so far, and even then she was trying to make it a power play, knowing that I wanted her there and she wasn't going to let me know if she was coming. She showed up for my thesis just as I was starting to speak, and left immediately after I finished, before I could even make it to the back of the room to thank her for coming. She congratulated me later by text. When I talked to her on the phone later that weekend, she made a derogatory comment about the food I had for my defense, knowing that my boyfriend prepared all of the food for it so that I didn't need to worry about it. Note that she was the only one that commented poorly on it - everyone else told me the food was awesome. Also, she left without meeting my boyfriend - who I've been dating for 2.5 years and she hadn't met yet (this was also a point of contention for us, even though she never asked to meet him, never tried to schedule a visit to meet him, and constantly shit on him for \"only being a waiter\"). \n\nPositive note in this sea of negativity: I did successfully defend my thesis. I totally only cried a little bit when my advisor congratulated me. :) \n\nI moved, with my boyfriend, about a month later, so I had a lot of time to think about my mom without having her near me. I was SO ANGRY for a while. I felt guilty for moving so far, guilty for how bad she felt that I didn't want her to move with me, guilty for not actually wanting her to move with me! But I also felt relieved - I was 12 hours away, and I couldn't feel the constant background guilt of being close enough to visit but not actually visiting. \n\nSince then, with lots of thinking and crying and getting mad and getting sad, I finally came to terms with a few things. I'm not totally over my mom not being the person I need her to be - but it doesn't keep me up at night like it used to. I don't feel guilty about not calling or coming home. I don't feel guilty about moving or starting my own life. And I know she'll never apologize for anything, so I don't hope for that any more, and that's freeing too. I spent a lot of time re-examining my childhood through the lens of \"my mom has NPD and cannot behave like a healthy person can\" rather than the lens of \"no matter what I do I'm not good enough\" and it has helped me heal quite a bit. Before I left, my mom had said she wanted to do something about our relationship, and I decided that, to move forward, we would both need to do just that - leave the past behind, no apologies from either of us, and start over, but this time with the attitude of \"I'm not going to take her shit.\" \n\nI attended my graduation, and decided to stay at my mom's for a few days beforehand. We had a good few days without mentioning our relationship, and then the morning of my PhD hooding, she woke me up with \"I need to know if you're going to be there for me.\" The following conversation was the first time I ever knew what I wanted to say to her, and flat out said it. She said our relationship was superficial for the last couple of years and she wasn't OK with that. I told her that our relationship had been superficial since I was old enough to have opinions, that I hid parts of myself from her that I knew she wouldn't approve of, that I'm not even allowed to be happy if I'm happy about something that she doesn't think I should be happy about. I told her that her idea of repairing our relationship is me magically agreeing with everything she says and does and never having a problem with it, and that's never going to happen. Basically, imagine all of the things you wish you could say to the N in your life, and then imagine you said them. \n\nThey had about the effect you would expect. It wasn't nothing - oh no, it was about her. \"So basically our relationship has been a complete lie.\" \"I've never felt as alone in my entire life as I do now.\" I told her that for the few couple of years of grad school I was suicidal and that I had tried to tell her, but she never really heard me - every time I tried to tell her how I felt I always got \"Well you think THAT'S bad, listen to what happened to me...\" She told me that I must have been mistaken because if I had said I was suicidal she would've listened. \"I guess I just can't do anything right.\" Yes, even my suicidal thoughts were about her. Unsurprising, for an N, and I wasn't even angry about it. Nothing changed - but I was relieved! I finally had my answer! I always wondered, you know, what if some of this is on me, what if I just never told her how I felt, how is she supposed to change if she doesn't know what's wrong? But I did, I told her everything - and she reacted the exact same way she always did. It was never me, there was never anything I could do. Realizing that was like a weight lifted off of my shoulders. So I told her what I needed from a relationship with her - to move forward. I told her that I knew she did the best she could (probably true - she thinks she's doing what's best for me, in her fucked up NPD way, and it's not like she *chooses* to be like that, she just *is*) and that there's no point in living in the past, and I just want to move forward. I want to find a new way to go forward. She claimed she did too. I thought this was my chance to start over with my new no shit-taking attitude. \n\nShe came to my PhD hooding with my grandmother, and left before she met my boyfriend AGAIN. She did not go to my full graduation even though my boyfriend's dad (who worked at the place where I was graduating) got her a private room with air conditioning (part of her disability is heat sensitivity and being prone to dehydration). She told me the morning of that she wasn't coming. Honestly, at that point, I didn't care - my boyfriend's family came, and they are wonderful people who treat me as part of their family. My trip was very pleasant after I left her house, saw my friends, did the whole ceremony thing, drank excessively. It was wonderful. \n\nSince I've been back from my trip, our relationship hasn't... exactly moved forward. She's still herself, and there's nothing I can do about that. I haven't called her, but tried to text her regularly. This worked for me. However, the culmination of all of this, and what I'm really writing about (long windup, I know), happened a few weeks ago. I had asked how she was doing, she mentioned she was outside for too long and had heat exhaustion. Wasn't feeling well. I didn't ask how she was doing - a little rude on my part, but this is not the first time this has happened and she always ends up being fine. I texted her about something else a day later. And then something else, a few days after that. Finally a week later, I said \"I haven't heard from you in a while. Is everything OK?\" and she responded \"I had mentioned I had heat exhaustion. I've been sick for about a week.\" I responded with \"I'm sorry I didn't check in sooner. Are you feeling better now?\" and I've gotten no response since. This was about three weeks ago. Last week, I noticed she posted on her facebook that she was having some kind of reaction to a medicine her doctor gave her. I thought about texting her about it, and decided against it - if she wanted to talk to me, she could talk to me like an adult and not communicate through facebook statuses. As I thought, she was using them as a test - I didn't text her about them, she restricted my ability to see her profile, and the last thing I can see on her profile is one of those stupid pictures with text on them that says \"If someone acts like they don't care about you, believe them.\" Absolutely aimed at me. \n\nSo it seems that I've accidentally gone NC, half because she seems to have decided if I don't want to have the relationship she wants to have then she's going to cut me out entirely (one of the traits of people with NPD is an all-or-nothing attitude and I have noticed this from her all of my life, even before I knew what NPD was), but half because I have also decided that I am not going to continue to exert energy trying to figure out her tests. \n\nMy only \"problem\" with being NC with her is that I constantly feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. Earlier in life, if I ever went this long without texting her, it would be a real shitshow when we started talking again - and we always did, because there was the expectation of going to her house for holidays or whatever. Honestly, I don't know how I feel about being NC. Part of me is relieved, for sure, but part of me is still a little on edge, like I can't just start texting her again like nothing's happened, so do I text her and be like \"what's with this not talking stuff\" or do I just... assume that if she wanted to talk, she would, and continue to not text her? I don't know. I need to figure out what the right course of action is for me. But I'm not there yet, and I feel a bit like I'm in limbo. \n\nThis ended up being quite long. Thanks for reading :) If you've got any \"oops I accidentally went NC\" stories, feel free to share them! ",

Lastly, and I guess I didn't realize how much it bothered me until I felt I had to include it here, is the fact that I'll mention people in my life and he won't remember who I'm talking about. Now, there's really only a double handful of folks in my life, so it always struck me as odd, but I'd always shrugged it off. Now I'm not so sure. On the other hand, he did a hail mary suggestion and was able to get me on an anti-depressant that actually works, but it's so far outside the box that most people wouldn't have thought to try it.\n\nIn the meantime, I found a different therapist, one who DOES take my current insurance, and this guy is pretty great. I've gotten to see him every week for the last three weeks, and he's been pretty good about helping me through a difficult time. He's also come up with a treatment plan and has a pretty good idea of where he wants to take therapy. The problem I have with him is A) he's younger than me by about a decade, and B) sometimes he seems unprepared for dealing with the level of abuse I've had. However, he seems willing to try, whereas the old therapist just seemingly did't know where to start. \n\nIn a month, my insurance is changing again, and I'll have the option of seeing whichever I choose. I always thought I'd go back to the old therapist, but now I'm kind of torn. Any thoughts?",

These memories do not involve any time I spent with my Nparents. \n\nMy Nparents have all the photos of my childhood. Whilst I don't want to look at the photos of me as a child I do regret that they have all the photos of me at school, and my pets. They have stolen my childhood and now I feel that they have my good memories hostage. \n\nI have no intention of communicating with them. My NC is too important. And I feel that if they knew I wanted them they would destroy them, just because I want them. I am not in contact with anyone I went to school with so I can't get the photos from another source.\n\nHow do I come to terms with this? ",

        "text": "I've been NC with my family-of-origin for 1 year (after 2 years of VLC). I love being NC. I am *thriving* now.\n\nLast week, Undiagnosed-Borderline-Mom sent an email: She's moving out of her house. She has two boxes of \"my things\" sitting in her garage, and she's wondering what to do with them.\n\nThe first box contains drawings, art, and little sculptures. I packed this box myself, right before leaving their nightmarish household, and starting a new life for myself in college. I'm *curious* to see what's in this box. I'm also *terrified*, because I know it's full of triggers. I drew pictures of monsters, and dismembered people, because my family was effectively torturing me, and I had no other outlet, and didn't understand why this was happening to me.\n\n*...In my mind's eye, I open the box, and peer inside...*\n\nHere's a hasty sketch of a horned demon, squatting in a pool of blood, held down by chains! Here's a creepy page of alien eyeballs, and alchemical symbols! Here's a drawing of my crappy hometown engulfed in flames. Here's a schematic for a \"mind control device\", which 8-year-old-me planned to attach to my mother's head, to fix her frequent outbursts and rages.\n\nIt's awful, and embarrassing. I hate it. I've been teetering on the edge of an emotional flashback since reading her email. My body is cringing inside, waiting for the screaming to start.\n\nAnd!... There's a *second* box, which was curated *by her*. It contains her impression of me: baby photos (because she needs me helpless, and dependent on her), and lots of *school work* (because my purpose is to be a success object, and achieve perfect grades, no matter how much it hurts. No matter how much they scream and beat their children.)\n\nShe emphasized that she's a wonderful person, a veritable *saint*, for taking the time to assemble this second box, and how *hard* it was for her to do this over the span of several years, and the first box is heavier, so she would rather just send the second one.\n\nI have no baby photos of myself, or mementos of my pre-college life. What I have, right now, is a chance to completely sever the link between child-me and adult-me. I should tell her to throw those boxes in the dumpster.\n\nThe only reason I'm hesitating is because there *might* be a nugget of wisdom buried in those boxes; a drawing that triggers a forgotten memory? More evidence of their abuse? An opportunity for closure/integration?\n\nIf my mother wasn't involved, I would probably ship those boxes to my house, then end up shredding 99% of whatever's inside.\n\nI don't know what to do. Has anyone else gone through this, and received a bunch of stuff from childhood? Was the experience helpful, or harmful? Thanks.",

And im mainly focusing on myself and my husband (and in turn my personal fleas). An example: before my mother finally quit contacting me she said \"you cant be the victim forever, you cant blame your parents forever\" i struggle so deeply with this. Often times i practically mentally stab myself when i make a mistake, including at work. I call myself stupid, retard, etc. (In turn blaming myself for everything.) These are things im working on. Its hard. How do you guys deal with it?",

        "text": "My parents visited today. They said they would leave at 10 to be at my house by 12. At 10.30 my mum phoned, she was on the verge of tears and her voice was weak and shaky. What terrible tragedy had befallen them, I hear you ask? ...A traffic jam. They were stuck in a traffic jam. So I had to reassure and comfort my mum - don't worry mum, there's always lots of traffic there, it'll clear up after the bridge. Which makes me really angry because of the ZERO reassurance and comfort that she showed me when I was growing up. It's hard to think of a less comforting figure than my mother.\n\nAnyway I continue my cleaning and tidying. I realised I felt quite bad and in the past I wouldn't have been able to understand that fully, I just would have felt bad. Now though, I was able to realise that I felt guilty in some way, because it was my fault that my mum was upset. I should have suggested a different day for them to visit, or a different time. There's no way I can predict the traffic, especially closer to their house than mine, but still I felt like it was all my fault and therefore I am a bad person who does bad things. My brain has been doing that little routine my entire life and this is the first time I've understood it.\n\nSome time later, phone rings again and my mum sounds even worse. \"Someone's driven into us!\" That does actually sound bad, are they okay, what happened? She's hard to get any sense out of but turns out they were stationary and the car behind was stationary, then the latter was knocked into by a lorry which shunted her forward and she bumped into my parents. No visible damage to any of the three vehicles.\n\nMy dad is out of the car talking to the other people, my mum's going \"I don't know what he's doing!\" I say \"he'll be exchanging insurance details\". \"Oh I don't know Penny, I don't know what they're doing!\" \"I just said mum, they'll be exchanging insurance details, it's what you have to do.\" \"I don't know Penny, I just don't know!\"\n\nI know it would have been a shock, but seriously, it's the smallest car accident anyone could have. Not moving, no damage, no injuries. No need to be sobbing and incoherent. I'm kind of speechless so I just tell her to sit in the car and let dad deal with it. By the time my chores are done and I'm waiting for them to arrive I'm physically shaking with bitterness and dread.\n\nThey eventually get to my house at 1pm and we have tea and biscuits. I try to say to my mum that her reaction was over the top (probably could have worded that better) and she's instantly defensive, NO IT WASN'T PENNY. Okay, whatever. My dad tries saying that it was stressful but not that bad and my mum comes out with this gem: \"It was trauma!\" She actually believes that sitting in a traffic jam and someone bumps your car is trauma. Not just stressful, annoying, a bit of a shock. Trauma.\n\nWhat fucking planet is she on, oh yeah, the same one she's been living on for decades now. Planet Pennysmum where the laws of nature have been replaced by the laws of Pennysmum's feelings (do remember that the laws are flexible and subject to change, always check you have the latest version). The same planet I grew up on in fact. On Planet Pennysmum, you get 24 years of feeling unsafe, unloved, alone, powerless, and in fear of the unpredictable. THAT'S FUCKING TRAUMA MUM. THEY'VE EVEN GOT A SPECIAL NAME FOR IT.\n\nIf anyone can recommend a good traffic jam therapist, do let me know.",
