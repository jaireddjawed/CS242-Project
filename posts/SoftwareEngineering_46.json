In [this small ebook](http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0391/) you will find 42 recommendations about coding in C++ that can help a programmer avoid a lot of errors, save time and effort. The author is Andrey Karpov - technical director of \"Program Verification Systems\", a team of developers, working on PVS-Studio static code analyzer. Having checked a large number of open source projects, we have seen a large variety of ways to shoot yourself in the foot; there is definitely much to share with the readers. Every recommendation is given with a practical example, which proves the currentness of this question. These tips are intended for C/C++ programmers, but usually they are universal, and may be of interest for developers using other languages.",

        "text": "I work for a very technically oriented company.  While software is not its focus, software is an large part of the product.  I am one of two \"application integration architects\" (AIA) tasked with making the process seamless and efficient.  While I do design, I am also expected to code, debug, and perform the full stack of implementation.  I have over 30 years of experience doing just that.  I work for a former software developer, now the project manager (PM).  The other AIA is younger than I, about 15 years of experience.  We have a group of developers, QA, and admins.\n\nWe are tackling a new project with several purchased and in-house software products.  I have been giving presentations to the team with the design ideas that I believe that will achieve the goals of the project.  It's pretty basic stuff: data flows, design patterns, and high level construct choices.\n\nWhat I am having a hard time with is the silence.  No feedback is offered during the presentation, and none afterward.  I'm new to this group, but not the company, and have not experienced the complete lack of comment.  It is like they are just going through the motions.\n\nMy fellow AIA, one on one, is the same.  Best I could get out of him was, \"Ok, looks good.\"  He was hired from the outside, so he shouldn't be part of a culture of apathy, which is what this feels like.\n\nSo, what can I do?  I need them to engage.  Please, advise.",

        "text": "I'm looking for feedback from anyone who has moved from being a software engineer to a security software engineer. I know these can be broad terms, so I'll list what I do now and then what I would be doing afterwards.\n\nNow:\n\n* Primarily backend development using Flask (Python), Mongo, ElasticSearch. Some (10%) frontend internal Admin Dashboard type stuff using Angular 1.5.\n\n* A lot of researching bugs and fixing said bugs.\n\n* Backend \"rules\" processing.. This is converting backend machine rules (x12) into human readable JSON payloads, and vice-versa.\n\n* Code reviews, meetings, troubleshooting, etc....\n\n\nAfterwards: \n\n* The same stuff, with the exception of...\n* About 30% going over audit logs each day. Examples given to me were reading over Nessus scans after our dev environment deploys. Another example would be going over the server access logs to verify no unauthorized access has been gained. Searching through our internal error reporting system to verify nothing fishy is happening there. \n* My other time would be spent doing the stuff I mentioned above, but from a more security driven standpoint.\n* I would not be on the infrastructure team, but would be required to learn a lot more about our infrastructure. (Good thing).\n* I imagine I would spend a decent amount of time reading / learning.\n\nI'm interested in security. I would like to one day work in pen testing or something similar. I told my boss that my only reservation about taking the job is that I don't want to give up coding. He reassured me by saying that he didn't want me to stop doing that either. I would still be writing code, but just sometimes different code and maybe not as much of it as I have been. \n\nAbout me. Less than five years experience. CS degree from 4 year university. Currently working at a round B startup in Healthcare. Would like to stay here for another year or two and then possibly move. \n\nI am leaning heavily towards accepting the position, but would like to get feedback from anyone who has made a transition like this before. \n\nThanks!",
