        "text": "Execs that don't care for technology are just the best aren't they? I work for a manufacturing company where I stand as their only form of IT support. I am the IT department for multiple sites.\n\nToday I had to deal with a couple execs, lets call them $exec1 and $exec2.\n\nI get a call at 9:00am this morning about a label printer not working at a different site to me. Fair enough, I start to pack my things to go over straight away (no label printer means orders can't go out on time). As I'm packing my stuff, $exec1 approaches and tells me that I need to come and help him set up his laptop in the boardroom *right now*. I tell him there are instructions in the room on how to do it and to call me if he gets stuck, as I have to go and deal with something at a different site. He straight up refuses and basically orders me to do it. I agree as I know it will only take a few seconds to plug in a cable and I can be on my way with little to no fuss.\n\nFast forward a few hours later, both execs now in the meeting. I am on the phone to an MSP about fixing another printer that has stopped working. #ILovePrinters. Suddenly $exec2 storms into my office. \"Slackmastergeneral97, i need your help, come quickly\" I tell the MSP I'll have to call them back, drop everything and follow him into the kitchen. \"We need to lay this food out in the boardroom for the visitors.\" Are you f$$$ing kidding me?! It wasn't even a lot of food, he could have easily done it himself. What a joke. I now have to go and call MSP again and sit through another 10 minutes of hold music because he couldn't be bothered to carry one extra tray of food.\n\nFast forward another 20 minutes later, I am now on the phone with a user at the other end of the site, trying to walk them through a fix, when this time $exec1 storms into the office and says \"One of the visitors can't connect their laptop to our screen, I've tried and it's not working, come and help now\", again I drop everything, tell the user I'll call them back and go and see what I can do. $exec1 goes to the toilet on the way to the boardroom so I go in alone. There were two key things that I noticed were wrong with the set-up. First of all, the TV in the boardroom wasn't even switched on, how on earth they didn't figure that out before I don't know. Second of all, it looked like the $exec1 had been trying to plug the mini displayport cable into the usb port on the laptop, surely you should be able to match up the cable end with the socket right? Clearly not. I plugged it in and away they went.\n\nThe meeting started at 10:30am and isn't scheduled to finish until 4pm. It's still only 1:30pm. Lovely.\n\nOf course, all of these issues are part and parcel of being an IT Technician, but it's really sucky that people won't try these things themselves or will abuse their power to get everyone to do simple things for them. It's just annoying that they crap themselves during meetings because they haven't prepared, and then blame you for their lack of preparedness.",

        "text": "This week started off really nice. Yesterday, after being in the office for less than 5 minutes my colleague informs me about a certain test we were running, which was just plain hilariouss. Hence why i'm sharing.\n\n*****\n\n**Preface**\n\nSo, this one is about a test we're doing. As some of you might remember, i work as a network engineer in an automotive company. What we're doing at the location i work at is the development of driver assistance systems. This includes optical systems. Now, said test that is going on is basically the preparation for the new generation of these optical systems. We're doing hardware-in-the-loop simulation with them, which requires shoving video data into these things via ethernet. Now, the first and current generations were fine with 1Gbit eth. The next one, gen3, has enough resolution and framerate to require 10G, which in turn requires different switches than those we are currently using.\n\nSo, we've bought a few switches to test, i dropped a quick config on them and sent them to the \"customer\". He wired everything up - Server&lt;&gt;Switch&lt;&gt;Camera - and started testing.\n\nThe people involved need no introduction. \"$Phrew\" and \"$Co\"lleague.\n\n*****\n\nIt was too early to be awake on a monday. 7AM is way too early on a monday. But alas, nothing could be done, $Phrew needed to be in office at 8, which he barely managed due to the traffic being slightly more arduous than usual. Barely through the door into the IT-Space, he gets waved over by $Co. Expecting the worst - bein having to deal with issues before having had a coffee - $Phrew sauntered over.\n\n&gt; $Phrew: Mornin'. 'Sup?\n\n&gt; $Co: Hey. You look like you need a coffee. Either way...remember that switch we sent over to $Location? With the server that kept disconnecting from it every now and then?\n\n&gt; $Phrew: *after remembering having talked about it on friday* Yeah...did they check the NIC? Was it fried?\n\n&gt; $Co: Naw, even better. Now...you do remember what they're using that thing for, right? The cams?\n\n&gt; $Phrew: Uhuh.\n\n&gt; $Co: Well, it turns out that the hardware is fine. We have the same machines over here, so i grabbed one of those switches and wired it up to see what happens. And the connection was working fine.\n\n&gt; $Phrew: And why are they having issues? It's not the cable, not the switch, not the NIC?\n\n&gt; $Co: Yup. I talked to them about it and they said they've disabled one of the two CPUs via the device manager, because they're using it for some realtime stuff. They even have their own driver for that.\n\n&gt; $Phrew: WAT?\n\n&gt; $Co: Exactly. Anyways, i've tested that and had the same symptoms with our machine, as soon as you disable the CPU, the NIC goes bonkers and starts disconnecting every 10 seconds.\n\n&gt; $Phrew: *laughing* Well...there is your problem.\n\n&gt; $Co: I told them that, yes. You know what they said? \"The NIC is used to access your storage systems, so you better fix it\"\n\n&gt; $Phrew: *[while making this face](https://gph.is/14o3USk)* How does it even matter what the NIC is used for?\n\n&gt; $Co: It doesn't. And it's not even used to access the storage, it's for connecting the cameras to the server.\n\n&gt; $Phrew: So...even if we'd go by their logic, it'd still be their problem?\n\n&gt; $Co: Correct. Oh, and they do the same crap with the NIC, except that they just sideload their fancy driver when they're about to use the NIC. The rest of the time it runs with the regular one.\n\n&gt; $Phrew: professionals...Coffee?\n\n&gt; $Co: Coffee.\n\n**TL;DR:** The NIC that was into threesomes with CPUs.\n\n*****\n\nPrevious Stories:\n\n* [Don't do the thing - Oops, i did the thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4eqzlr/guys_dont_do_the_thing_it_breaks_stuff_oh_i_did/)\n\n* [Snowflake Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7hy00f/netnotworking_snowflake_servers/)\n\n* [Personality issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ie176/netnotworking_personality_issues/)\n\n* [Internet of Sh...](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7juazk/netnotworking_internet_of_sh/)\n\n* [Wait for it...](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7oyi52/netnotworking_wait_for_it/)\n\n* [Hello Darkness my old Friend](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ui7e1/netnotworking_hello_darkness_my_old_friend/)\n\n* [Here is your shovel](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/85jotu/netnotworking_here_is_your_shovel/)\n\n* [Cables.

I've been using tech for years now but I'm very new to professional tech support. About 3 months into an IT apprenticeship. We are a fairly small support company that support local businesses (ones that aren't big enough to have their own IT). Right, onto the story.\n\nSitting in the office on my own and pretty much 9'o'clock on the dot the phone starts ringing.\n\nThe user, who works for a decently sized manufacturing company, is having an issue logging in.\n\nGo through the usual; unblock account, check username is correct, reset password. However even after resetting the password he still can't get in.\n\nI make sure 100 times over he is typing it in correctly. So I asked him to slowly spell it out. \n\n\"Caps lock on, x, caps lock off, y, z, 1, 2, 3, exclamation mark.\"\n\nAnd then I remembered all the posts from this very subreddit. So many people using caps lock for symbols. I ask him how he types an exclamation mark and there it is.\n\n\"Caps lock on, 1, caps lock off.\"\n\nSo I explained how to correctly use symbols on the keyboard and sent him on his merry way.\n\nThank you TFTS.\n\nTL;DR Caps lock is for capital letters only.",

Internet and phones both which was kind of odd that it was both since they still had their phones running on analog.\n\nI get to the store and the show me where their equipment was. They was a switch and 66 block. Switch was powered on but I was getting no internet even with the correct static and none of the lines work on the block. \n\nSo a follow the cables to the other side of the warehouse where I find another switch and 66 block but same issue again so I continue following the cables back to the middle of the warehouse where the ran down the wall and into a hole in the floor. \n\nAll the employees are busy (only 3 employees were there) so I start opening doors until I find stairs to the basement. I flip the switch that I assume is the light switch but nothing happens so I use my phone as a flashlight, go half way down the stairs, and see the equipment I need but it was sitting in about 3 feet of crap water.\n\nApparently the toilets backed up and flooded the basement but no one knew because they never go down there.\n\nI called the company who sent me and informed of the problem. They wanted me to figure out a way to get the site temporarily up until they could permanently fix them but I told them no. Besides the fact the it was highly unlikely any of the equipment was salvageable there was absolutely no way I was going into that water.",

        "text": "I sat down to day with myself (the sysadmin), my director, project manager, another sysadmin and the Helpdesk manager to discuss a major issue. We have an old ticketing system that has been mothballed for over 2yrs now. We no longer own the license for the software, server OS, or virtual OS the server is running on and the hardware it is currently on is out of warranty. It would seem to be a no brainer that this system be shutdown.\n\nNot so fast! We have one user (the manager of site services) that still uses the application to reference old tickets. For two years now we have been trying to get him to move those tickets to the new system to no avail. He has in excess of 70,000 tickets in the system and his argument is that he may need to reference one of them to duplicate a solution. Our compromise to him was to export the tickets into CSV format and he keep a local file.  \n\n\nThe helpdesk manager has been attempting to do this and each time he tries to get the csv to export, he gets a 505 error from the website. After months of trying he called a meeting to discuss what other options we could employ to get these tickets out the system. Needless to say the customer is not going to budge on his need for all **SEVENTY THOUSAND TICKETS!**\n\nThe first idea that was brought up was to increase the server resources. Since the hardware array is all but empty both us system admins agreed that was an option. The other option was to access the database directly and bypass the web gui and extract the tickets manually. That was also an option although the individual that would be tasked to do this balked at the idea since it entailed significant work.  \n\n\nThat is when I asked the following question \"What range of tickets have you tried to export?\" The helpdesk manager looked at me like I was speaking Greek. I said \"Have you tried a week?\" He said \"I am not going to go week by week for 9yrs until I pull all his records!\" I said \"No. I am not expecting you to do that\" I am asked to see if it is even possible to pull the records at all. You start with a week, expand to a month, then a year, then two and see where the process times out.\"  He said he had not thought of that.  \n\n\n10mins later we determined that you could indeed extract tickets a year at a time (9 extracts) without fail. The glares I got as I exited the room were enough to make me look over my shoulder as I walked to my car this evening.",

As a 1st-level-Helpdesk admin I was exicted about getting my first little deployment project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this is a Story about $me, a  colleague  $bro, our client $client and the support for a MDM branded by a big ISP in my country $support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$bro: \"Hey $me, the boss from $client got in touch with us. He wants a Server for the MDM Cloud deployed. I don't have the time. Would you like to do it. If needed you can get help from $support. $Client booked 3 hours support, so go for it\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$me: \"of course, thanks for the opportunity.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I install the server, try to follow the most shitty manual I ever readed.  Now I had the problem to connect the server with the Cloud for the MDM.\n\nSo I dial up the $support. And ask them for the ports so I can fix this in the firewall.  Everything fine. \n\nThan after 2 days of getting around the system I dial them up on getting the roles right and how to roll out the Apps for the Android devices. Also everything fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now the problems started. I ran into the issue that I can't connect to the mail server anymore. So I dial them up:\n\n\"Hi this is $me. I am calling again because I can't responds from the Mail server. I did as you said but still refused connection.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$support: \"Ah you forget to set up the certificate. please issue it from the Cloud via the menu.\"\n\n$me: \"You sure about it a need a pkcs7 cert, but don't get the PK for it.\"\n\n$Support: \"totally sure.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nokay I do and ran, as expected the issue. Calling them up again. They \"Fix\" something in the cloud. Now **every** cert functions. Calling them up, they first deny it, after showing they just send me a \"correct\" cert. Still not working. I escalate my issue to higher support who still can't fix this issue, even their 3rd Level doesn't know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I brainstorm with my $bro. We try some ideas and after making a correct cert via openSSL and booking the right cert in a well known SSL store. We finally getting the thing up and running and the $client happy (we needed more than a month).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThan things went horrible for me. $Client asked us what the problems were and we delivered the mails  and information on the problems we had with $Support especally on  the fact. That we asked them 3 times if they respond is correct and they claimed that it was correct (but wasn't).   \n\n\n$Support accused me on lying and stuff like that. Even billed us for calling them (twice the amount of time I called with them and ignoring the booked support by $client).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy bosses weren't happy, becaused our company had a tough time and we wasted even more time on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end the CEO of $Support apologized to us and tried to get me into his firm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I had my first small project on deployment. Bad manuals and shitty support made me figure it out all by myself. After fixing some shit was thrown at me.",

For the longest time \"the box\" was her nemesis. She hated the box and the box hated her. About 4 years ago she snuck the box into the pile of stuff for a garage sale and sold it. The entire box gone in seconds. After the garage sale is done and I am back from helping a friend set up some furniture in their new apartment she hands me $10 and says the box of cords sold.\n\nI was very confused and then run to my room to find my box missing. Needless to say I was annoyed. Little did we know the box would have its revenge. About a week later she comes to me asking if I had a USB to micro USB cable for her phone. I reply very calmly with a smile, \"let me check my box\". She then frowns and says oh. The next day she asks if I had a power cable for her monitor that she decided she wanted to use after letting it sit for 4 months. I reply again with \"let me check my box\", this struck home my point I guess because she has been an avid defender of the new box ever since.\n\nThis brings us to last week.\n\nMy grandmother finds one of my boxes (yes I have multiple now) in her garage and sets it with garage sale stuff. (My family lived with my grandparents and my mother still does as they arent as spry as they used to be). I was outside moving stuff into position for the sale when I hear my grandma and mother arguing quite loudly. I wander in and find the two standing over a box yelling at eachother.\n\nMother: DONT YOU DARE SELL THAT BOX IT IS IMPORTANT\nGrandma: ITS A BOX FULL OF CABLES AND ITS TAKING UP SPACE\nTreedon: I could just take the box over to my place \nGrandma: FINE\n\nGrandma then stormed out of the room and I stuck the box over in a corner by the stuff I was taking. A few days later my grandma calls asking if I had a power cable for her laptop since hers broke. Lo and behold there was one in the box.\n\nTL:DR\nDont mess with \"The Box\" it will get revenge",

No, my son has this in his wallet, he is a new student here from next semester on.\n\n&gt; oweh: Then he needs to be either present in person or I need a letter of attorney from him allowing you to do business in his name.\n\n&gt; RHM: Why has this be this complicated? I am his mother, I have rights.\n\n(No, mother, your son is of age, you don't have any more rights than I do.)\n\n&gt; oweh: Sorry, but I have my instructions and I can't break the law just for you.\n\n&gt; RHM: Hmpf, ok, I'll get him from the car.\n\n(What? Why not bring him with you to begin with?)\n\n10 Minutes pass and RHM and her Very Shy Son enter.\n\n&gt; RHM: OK, VSS, give the man your student ID and goverment ID so we can get this over with.\n\nVSS sheepishly hands me the documents, I verify he is he (and I see they are from half the Republik away and I wonder if his mother is going to live with him here) and the state the account is in. It is still inactive and there haven't been any attempts to activate it.\n\n&gt; oweh: (talking directly to VSS) So, please describe the problem you are having.\n\n&gt; RHM: We went to this website, entered the information and it always says \"Account unknown\" and after 3 attempts it blocks us.\n\n&gt; oweh: (talking directly to VSS) I see, but my systems shows no attempts at activating your account.\n\n&gt; RHM: This is impossible, I tried to do this for the last 2 weeks, since we received the documents!\n\n&gt; oweh: (gesturing to VSS) In that case, please follow me to our self-service kiosk here, and try to activate the account with me observing so I can see first hand what is wrong.\n\nVSS tries to stand up, his mother motions him down again and gets up herself.\n\n(Oh boy, this should be a grown-up man, starting to study at a university.)\n\nWe go to the kiosk system and I watch her opening the activation website and putting in a different username than the one on the letter.\n\n&gt; oweh: Sorry Ma'am, you can't just input any username, you have to use the one from the letter.\n\n&gt; RHM: Why? I can't accept that! I want my son to use the usernames I selected for him! Make this work!\n\n&gt; oweh: I am very sorry, but the IT systems here don't work that way. You have to use the username we provide and there is no other way. Also, because by activating the account, your son is entering a binding contract between him and the university, so it really should be him doing the activation and not you.\n\n&gt; VSS: (starting to rise from his chair) Mother ...\n\n&gt; RHM: VSS, you don't talk, I am talking to the clerk here. (Raising here voice) Sit down!\n\n&gt; oweh: Ma'am, if you start shouting I have to ask you to leave.\n\n&gt; RHM: Don't tell me how to talk to my son! Now: are you going to create this account thing the way I want or not?\n\n&gt; oweh: Sorry Ma'am, I cannot do this.\n\n&gt; RHM: Hmpf! Come VSS. We. Are. Leaving! We have to think about you studying here if everyone is such an incompetent moron.\n\n&gt; oweh: Ma'am, I must ask you to leave now.\n\nRHM gestures her son to get up and get on, does a 180 and huffs out of the building.\n\nVSS does a standing sprint start out of the chair and leaves trailing his mother, but not before flashing me a pained and forced smile and a shrug.\n\noweh needs to sit down and take a deeeeep sip of his now luke-warm coffee.",

Admin will be $person1.\n\nI provision the VM from a template and send a mail back to $HoDept and $person1:\n\n&gt; oweh: ok, here is your VM, instructions on how to use it are at $url and $person1 has been given all necessary permissions. Have fun!\n\n**February 2009:**\n\n&gt; $person1: Hey oweh, I have this VM here and I need instructions on how to access and use it.\n\n(Looking at the VM, is was never booted and is still in its initial state.)\n\n&gt; oweh: Sure, instructtions are at $url. But since Windows Server 2003 r2 is quite old, would you like a newer Windows Server 2008 VM?\n\n&gt; $person1: That would be nice.\n\n&gt; oweh: OK, I deleted to old one and provisioned a new one with Windows Server 2008 for you. Have fun!\n\n**Oktober 2010:**\n\n&gt; $HoDept: Did you already provide a Windows VM for $project in $dept?\n\n(This time I needed to jog my memory by looking at the ticket system what this was all about. The 2nd VM was also never booted and is also still in its initial state.)\n\n&gt; oweh: Yes, twice, $person1 has access.\n\n&gt; $HoDept: oh, $person1 does no longer work in $dept. Please get in contact with $person2 for this VM.\n\n(Oh boy ... I remove $person1 and add $person2 to the permissions.)\n\n&gt; oweh: Hello $person2, you got access to a Windows VM for your project. Instructions are at $url. But since Windows 2008r2 is the current release and new project should normally use a newer version than the VM currently has, would you mind if I provision a new 2008r2 VM for you?\n\n&gt; $person2: No problem, the vendor even recommends using Windows 2008r2.\n\n&gt; oweh: Here you go, have fun!\n\n**April 2012:**\n\n&gt; $New-HoDept: We have some problems with the Server for $poject and $person2 is on vacation. Can you look at it?\n\n&gt; oweh: Sure, please give me a moment to  ~~aquiece~~ acquaint myself with the situation.\n\n(You guessed it, the VM was never even powered on and is still in its initial state. Was zur Hölle?)\n\n&gt; oweh: Yeah, the VM is totally unconfigured. I don't know what you have been using up until now, but it sure wasn't this specific server.\n\n&gt; $New-HoDept: Interesting. Please add myself as Administrator for this server and remove $person2.\n\n&gt; oweh: You got it! Instructions are at $url, have fun!\n\n(It was later discovered that $person2 ran a mockup of the project on their laptop which had died during their vacation. But nobody could have ever used the software for anything serious because it was more shell than anything usable. So everyone must have just logged in, seen the mockup dashboard and called it a day, without realizing there wasn't anything else there.)\n\n**June 2015:**\n\n&gt; $person3: Hi, I am the new admin for the project VM, can you give me access?\n\n&gt; oweh: Of course, let me run that by $New-HoDept. (Cc'd)\n\n&gt; $New-HoDept: Yes, $person3 is the new person for the project, please give her access\n\n&gt; oweh: No problem, $person3, you have access and the instructions are at $url. But since the systems is still on Windows 2008r2, hasn't been used ever and Windows 2012 is the current release, would you like a new VM with the most recent Windows Version?\n\n&gt; $person3: No, the vendor doesn't support 2012 at the moment.\n\n&gt; oweh: Right, have fun!\n\n**March 2018:**\n\nIn the light of Spectre, Meltdown and whatnot, we do a security analysis of all VMs, mailing all admins which may have vulnerable systems on their hand.\n\nThe VM for the project of $dept lights up like a Christmas tree. At least it seems to have been booted, has a correctly configured IP and is online. \n\n&gt; oweh: Hey $person3, your VM seems really unpatched and vulnerable. Please report back to us on how to remedy this or we will be forced to take your system offline in 2 weeks.\n\n&gt; $person3: (Automated response): \"Hi, I am currently on maternity leave and don't know when I well be back at work. Please direct all inquiries to $New-HoDept.\"\n\n(I sigh heavily internally.)\n\n&gt; oweh: Hey $New-HoDept, what is the story about $person3, the project and the VM for it? \n\n&gt; $New-HoDept: Oh, the project has been cancelled, the VM is no longer needed, please just delete it.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If your homepage is still listed in the Google Search results, you need to talk to Google to get this removed.\n\nMail from student:\n\n&gt; NO! You provided the homepage, you need to remove it, I demand it or I will sue $uni!\n\nAnswer:\n\n&gt; Dear Sir/Ma'am, I am going to refer this ticket to our legal adviser, you will hear from her in the next week about your options in this case.\n\nI move the ticket to the queue of our legal department and hope to be finally done with this.

But let's be real 4 weeks ago I didn't know the difference between a switch and a server. \n\nI've been using an old laptop that was kicking around for a while when I started as mine was caught up on the list of things to be ordered/shipped. As happens when you're in a small business people wear lots of hats. \n\nEveryone is aware that I'm an idiot for this stuff but a polite idiot who makes cookies for bribery as needed and will unashamedly bribe a tech with said cookies if it politely will get me my fix. \n\n(Tip for all people everywhere ever, bribe your IT people with food and be nice and they will fix almost anything you can fuck up if they have time.) \n\nYey new laptop arrives our T1 tech deploys it for me, at the end of my work day. Pops it on my desk ready to go for me. Perfectly ready to go yey. Idiot me is very, very happy to abandon my dinosaur back to the storage room. \n\nOnly thing left to do is swap my dual monitors, wireless keyboard/mouse and power supply from old dock to new dock. This should literally just be plug and play good to go. \n\nI'm being a good little non IT person, put them right next to each other and match up the little pictures, swap one cable at a time. Make sure everything is on and plugged in. Press magic power button and wtf? Not working. My mountain of data entry to do means I'm going to want to be spoiled and want those dual monitors. \n\nCue smiles and waiting for a different tech to be off the phone. Hey T2 tech, I swapped this over myself. It's not working assume I screwed it up somehow. When you get a second can you get it back up for me? \n\nYep no problem, checks all the cables are in properly power bar on. Installs something, let me know when that's done if it's still not working. \n\nAnd no love still won't work, by this time T1 is in and is like that machine was ready. Here I'll come do it quick before I head out on a call. Super quick, Checks cables again, asks me who set it up again, he knows he didn't told him I did. He checks the install thing and is confused. No reason it shouldn't be working. Has to go on site to a client, tells me to use my normal cable no duals for me and to suck it up until this afternoon. No problem I'll rearrange my day and leave data entry until later. \n\nCue T3, very confused this shouldn't be an issue, also really really likes cookies and will fix anything for me if it will get him any form of baked goods. Asks me who set up the dock? Told him me and what I did. He asks did the others know that? Yep. And while it's off proceeds to unplug everything from the dock. Plugs it all in the right spots, which was almost identical except for one plug, the power kind of important. Magic it all works. \n\nT3 proceeds to tell me, \"it's you, why would they think you did it right? You make good cookies, not this, now don't touch this again please.\" \n\n75 minutes later, functioning everything and despite forewarning of the Id10T error being most likely sweet naive techs didn't believe this was possibly something I could fuck up. And yes I'm now making cookies this weekend for Monday. Just believe me next time I tell you I fucked it up odds are I did. ",

        "text": "[You can read part 1 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9h7544/hotel_wifi_shenanigans/).\n\nThe fifth owner didn't want to pay for any maintenance or monitoring so we did our best to train the front desk manager on how to use all the equipment.  Since it was a simple unifi/edgerouter setup we did the best we could and left them to it.  I had recommended that the new owner show up to the training but he refused.  \n\nAbout two months after the install the front desk of the hotel called us asking for help.  It was a new employee as the old front desk manager had quit due to disagreements with the new owner.  The internet was out and they had been getting multiple DMCA notices.  After the last interactions I had with the owner I was surprised they were calling us at all.  I asked the new front desk person if they had gotten permissions from the new owner before calling us and they said \"the owner just said to f***ing take care of it and I found your card pinned to the wall\".\n\nI almost turned them down but the guy sounded desperate and said the owner was out of town and I wouldn't have to deal with him.  We had already blocked P2P traffic in the edgerouter during setup so figured it should be fairly simple to figure out.\n\nI arrive on site and have them fill out and sign a work order before I touch anything.  I get the signature and notice first off that the Edgerouter equipment was unplugged and that an old Netgear router was in its place.  The local network is still functioning, everything can print and get valid internal addresses. Internet is really down for the entire building, cable modem will not work even directly plugged into my laptop.   Since the cable TV is also out I let them know it has to be an issue on the ISP end of things.\n\nOf course no one on site is authorized to talk to the ISP support so the new guy calls the owner, owner is still out of town and is boiling mad when he finds out that they called me to fix this issue.  I can hear him yelling at his employee and eventually the employee hands me the phone.\n\nNew owner starts yelling at me and I cut him off and tell him I'll happily leave and won't charge for the call out even with the authorized signature but his entire internet is down and none of his employees or customers can get on the internet.  He keeps yelling and I hang up.\n\nI let the employee know that they should call someone else and that the new owner and I clearly will never get along and to please not call my company in the future.  Guy looks defeated but is totally understanding.  I feel bad for the guy because I remember what its like having a nightmare boss and explain a little bit of how the network works and that he should plug back in the edgerouter to stop the DMCA notices and show him where the passwords and stuff are. I start packing up my tools and get ready to leave.\n\nOwner calls the front desk right before I leave and asks me to take care of this issue and apologies for yelling at me.  He tells me the bills and account numbers passcodes are on his office computer and he gives me the password.   I sit down and call the ISP but the very first thing I notice without going into detail (because of posting rules) is that he is probably the source of all the DMCA notices.\n\nThe ISP gets on the line and I start asking about the DMCA notices when they inform me that the internet is down due to non payment.  The account is 4 months behind and internet and cable TV can be restored as soon as payment is made.\n\nFront desk guy is completely floored and asks me to tell the owner.  I get on the phone and let him know that his problems are because he didn't pay his bills and that the DMCA notices may be from guests but are also most partly his issues and I ask him why he removed the router.  He starts getting embarrassed and pissed and lets me know he removed our \"crappy equipment\" because it was blocking some of his internet usage.\n\nI try to explain why its in place and tried to educate him, but before I can finish he starts yelling at me that he won't pay us for just checking on the bill and that I'm just trying to get more money out of him.   I inform him that no one from my company will ever come back and that in the almost 20 years we have been open he is only the fourth person to be blacklisted (this means fired as a customer).  I hang up again and tell the front desk guy that I'm done and wish him well.\n\nI haven't heard from them for about 5 days, but two night ago I happened to be in the neighborhood and none of the access points are broadcasting around the hotel.  \n\nWish this one had a more satisfying ending but figured people would want to hear part 2.\n\nEdit - tl;dr\n\nHotel owner causes his own issues and doesn't pay his internet/cable bill.  Gets fired as a customer for being abusive on the phone, loses only employee that knows how to manage equipment and the site Wi-Fi appears to be completely dead.\n\n[And now there is a part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9iu9l8/hotel_wifi_shenanigans_part_3/\n).",

I've worked with pretty much every type of technology for a business environment imaginable. \n\nAlas it was not my day today. I've worked extensively with MFP's from Xerox, Canon and Ricoh etc. Someone set up a new Canon unit in our office a few weeks ago. Today I needed to scan some documents so that I could Email them. I head over with a stack of pages and insert them in the document feeder then press the directory button to find my Email address. I then set it to duplex and save as PDF. (The interface is pretty intuitive considering I'd never used this type of MFP) so I find it to be not difficult at all. I then press the big green Copy/Send button... Nothing happens. I try resetting the paper, the email address and settings, Nothing... I'm at it for like 5 minutes straight retrying everything that I can think of. Arrrgh...\n\nSomeone else sent a print job to it while I was standing there so the printer wasn't frozen or anything.\n\nSo the new guy who was able to escape 1st level support and join our team has worked with this new printer type before. We go through all the steps, nothing... again...\n\nHe then just nonchalantly turns it off and then back on... Of course it works now... first time. Now why didn't I think of that?\n\nI thanked him and kindly suggested that he not have me taken out behind the building and have me shot. :)\n\n\n\n \n  ",

        "text": "LTL, FTP\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MYSELF:** Started programming basic code in BASIC on a commodore 64 when I was six, My own first personal computer was given to me by my grandma when I was 17 (e machines 333 Celeron, 32 MB of smoking hot 66Mhz SDRAM, 4.3 GB HDD) which I immediately started saving and bought a ATI Radeon 7000. If you haven't guess by now I'm a hardware enthusiast, currently 36, working in IT\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WORKPLACE:** I work for what could best be explained as a school division, that only has a 3 person team to support 7 schools and a main office. The other two gentlemen that I work with are good people at heart, but are woefully lacking in hardware knowledge. The first has been there 9 years, it feels like he is coasting a bit, and is best suited to be a PR guy. In this case this is a good thing as there is some public speaking needed when our group has to address 300+ people when we have certain events. The second is really gifted with software, amazing musician, and knows Office 365 much better than I hope I ever have too. The main issue that allowed this story to happens is in the beginning of the year our IT manager was let go (not a bad thing, he was pretty clueless) and we three took over in a group management position while still being just the IT guys. And there are other stories I can share, but here is one example of being outvoted (ignored). Also of mention is I'm self taught, they have university degrees\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... for some reason gentleman number 2 is trying to setup a 4k video editing rig and decided to use an old server, dual processor board with a single XEON  E7540 (2.0 GHz 6/12, based on first gen \"core\" architecture) for some reason. It only had 8 GB of ram, and he asked me if we could upgrade the ram, I told him not a problem there is plenty of slots open and we have a a handful of old servers, same model he could steal ram from. Fast forward a couple of days and he tells me it doesn't work, at the time I was busy and could not see what the problem was. When I did get around to it I saw that he installed the ram in slots that ran off the second CPU, which if you have been reading, know is empty. Shaking my head a little I sent him a picture message showing on boot 48GB of ram about 10 minutes later after I moved the ram he installed over and some more to populate all 12 slots available to CPU 1. When he arrived to see that it was working I said to him jokingly \"yeah it has 48 gigabytes of ram now but the CPU is still a dog, you should throw a \\**$1000 GPU\\** into this, it will help you encode a bit faster with the right software and I can game on it at lunch\" and carry on with my day not thinking a second though about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... a couple of days later I get a group call from gentleman number 1 &amp; 2 letting me know me know *\\*$1000 GPU\\** is on it's way, enter panic mode. I try to explain it was a joke, the server, while having two 460W PSUs, the second is redundant, not adding up to provide 820W, the card they ordered recommends a 600W PSU based of having a i7, not a XEON with 12 sticks of ram and a raid consisting of 8 HDD. On top of that this is a server board that used a slot based PSU, there are connectors on the motherboard for powering additional parts, but I could not confirm for them at this time they were standard layouts. I arrived onsite and looked at the machine and did some research, from what I could tell there were some connectors that should be usable but I did not have my multi-meter on me to confirm pin outs but two of the connectors matched the 8 pin GPU power connector and the original cables should have came with the machine, which are now long gone. I tried to explain to them that I did not feel comfortable with that they were trying to do without being able to confirm the pin out of the connector and even if it matched the only thing I could think of off hand to order was a spare modular PSU cable for a 8 pin GPU cable, and even then I would need to confirm the cable didn't switch over cables between the ends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... a few days later as I'm on my way to a meeting that is 4 hours away I get a picture of a 2 8 pin GPU cables from a modular PSU and *\\*$1000 GPU\\** and let me know 2 760W PSUs (that thankfully are the right ones for this server) are on it's way. Defeated, I just reiterate that I would prefer to confirm the pin out is correct before they go forward, on the way back from the meeting I get a text that the machine wouldn't even start. I couldn't even bring myself to message anything back and ignored the message to the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... the next day I arrived on site a little early to arrive before the gentlemen so I could inspect what they had done. The card was still in the sever, installed on a PCI-e lane that belonged to CPU 2 and no GPU power cables attached to it, though they had been installed on the server board. I removed the GPU, gave it a quick sniff and thank goodness it didn't smell like the magic blue smoke escaped. Powered up the server and threw my multi-meter on the ends of the GPU power cables. A normal 8 pin GPU power cable has 12v on pins 1, 2 &amp; 3 the rest are grounds, on this connector I was getting 12v on pins 4, 5, 6 &amp; 7. I haven't found out for sure if they plugged the 8 pin cables in or if the card still works as this was today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll update as I know more if anyone is interested, but for now I'm trying to find the bottom of a bottle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: If you don\"t know the first thing about computer hardware, don't order it and for goodness sake don't attempt to install it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

On an average day we would receive about a hundred calls (company has around 15,000  employees) spread out among our 20 techs who show up throughout the day, and our average wait times during busy hours is an hour if it's really bad. Due to the change occurring we started receiving nearly a thousand calls in the span of a couple days with our wait times reaching upwards of 3 hours (thanks corporate). Well I received one call, that was at 2 hours and 50 minutes waiting and it was with an employee that is notorious for having odd or dumb calls, that really sticks with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nme: Hi you've reached the helpdesk, this is me, how can I help you today.\n\nclient: I tried to do the change you guys are doing and it isn't working.\n\nme: what is the error that you are receiving?\n\nclient: there is no error, there's nothing.\n\nme: That's odd, do you mind if we share screens? \n\nclient: sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe start sharing screens and I immediately notice that there is a window that is highlighted orange on the taskbar with the exact name of the thing that is supposed to pop up. So I clicked it and hit \"continue\" and the change started to occur. She goes off saying thanks and that's all she wrote. The thing that really strikes me is that she didn't do any work in that near 3 hours of waiting, and I was truly dumbfounded by it.",

I told him \"that's what happens when you reset it\" and I asked why he did a reset. Turns out for the past week or 2 (my guess) is Windows was trying to update and he was forcing it off saying \"it was taking too long to turn off\", and the other day I guess it finally got to the point where Windows got corrupted and needed to be reset but I guess he didn't read the 3 screens that say \"everything will be deleted\".\n\nNow for the best part, he is an independent real estate agent and he was working on some images for a home that needed to be submitted within 6 hours, he didn't keep his key for Photoshop, he didn't keep his key for Office, and he doesn't know his email password, and he didn't have any backups of his computer. \n\nSo I was just sitting there saying there was really nothing I can do without any passwords and keys. In the end we got trial version of Office and Adobe and we set up a temporary email so he could submit his files, also though this whole thing he just never fully understood that a reset would delete all his programs because he kept saying \"oh wait I'm also missing 'this' or 'that'\".

A little back story in this user,  he tends to exaggerate issues like his printer is totally out of ink and printing super light. I go check and it’s 50% full and 1% lighter than usual.

Maybe it's a software/OS problem... like some jerk switched the machine to a DVORAK keyboard ( we had a user that would do that on any machine he touched ). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe the user is just trying to log into a system that he/she doesn't actually have an account for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then there are things like the following conversation I just had...

It's Computer Aided Dispatching. Each officer logs into CAD so that they can be assigned calls.

The officer contacts dispatch when he goes on shift to tell them that he is 10-8, meaning that he is \"in service\".",

He will be `$ft`.\n\n*phone rings*\n&gt; $ft: Good morning, tech support speaking.  \n&gt; $caller: Hello, this is $caller, I think there's something wrong with my keyboard. When I type some keys, others show up, was it incorrectly programmed or something?  \n&gt; $ft: Incorrectly programmed? No, I don't think so. May I connect to your screen and see the problem?  \n&gt;  $caller: Of course!\n\n$ft connects and types a few letters, without any issue. This means that yes, this is probably a keyboard issue, although probably not related to \"programming\".\n\n&gt; $ft: I can type normally, can you show me what happens when you type?  \n&gt; $caller: Yes, look, right now I'm pressing \"a\".  \n\nWhat shows up is random letters, definitely not \"a\".\n\n&gt; $ft: Ok, I'll be right over.\n\n$ft then grabs a spare keyboard and heads over to where $caller is located.\n\nUpon arrival, $ft heads towards the computer and, without paying much attention to the keyboard, presses a few keys, noting that when he pressed CTRL, the letter \"O\" showed up, when he pressed space, it appeared the arrow keys were pressed.  \nAs he disconnects the keyboard and lifts is to replace it, he notices the weight is off... Upon closer inspection, he notes that under the key caps, the keyboard is absolutely SOAKED, some liquid still shifting inside and changing the weight balance.\n\n&gt; $ft: $caller, did you happen to spill anything on this keyboard?  \n&gt; $caller: Yes, I spilled some tea on it the other day, but I cleaned it up! Do you think it may have something to do with it?  \n&gt; $ft: Yes... It probably does...\n\n$ft swaps the keyboard, noticing that it probably wasn't \"some tea\" and probably a jarful, warns the user about being more careful with their drinks, and heads back to IT.\n\n$ft then tells this tale to me and our many coworkers. Many laughs were had. We got back to work, this was low level for our users anyway.  \n^^^^Maybe ^^^^some ^^^^day ^^^^I'll ^^^^tell ^^^^the ^^^^story ^^^^about ^^^^the ^^^^\"computers ^^^^that ^^^^disconnected ^^^^from ^^^^the ^^^^network\"",

A user got a phishing email saying that there is a PDF fax ready for them on SharePoint and gives them a link to office 265 to login to get it. \n\nNow on to how I heard about this and almost had a heart attack. The users that I work to support are all old farts that work with the Government and Military, meaning that they are wickedly book smart but NOT TECH SMART. \n\nA ticket came in from offending user asking if the email they got is a phishing attack. What sets the cheery on top is that the user included in the notes that they had the email in their inbox FOR A FEW DAYS AND CLICKED ON THE LINK. ONLY JUST NOW LETTING US KNOW THAT THEY \"MIGHT\" HAVE A PHISHING EMAIL AND TRIED TO LOGIN TO IT.\n\nThat immediately set off \"holy shit\" alarms in my head, knowing that a user accidentally gave a potential attacker a way in to our network. What's worse was that it was done DAYS ago so who knows if the attacker even got far. Thankfully we have MFA enforced at login. So at this point I changed his PW and sent an email to his supervisor regarding the incident. \n\nSometimes I stare at my 2 liter bottle of Jack Daniels and ask myself if I want to come into work the next day XD. \n\nSo to sum it up folks, use protection when it comes to logins. You don't want nasty baddies getting into your systems.",

        "text": "I was (and still am) royally confused. Let's set the playing field:\n\n&gt;$FC - Financial Controller  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$IM - Infrastructure Manager  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$TPC - Third Party Cabler  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DS - Me, Desktop Support\n\nSo in the midst of the office being literally torn down, to try and save on cost to run fiber to link 4 unique locations, our company trialed a Ubiquiti solution (we'd used it before, but never for this scale of approx 80 users, 200+ endpoints).\n\n**Note**: Fantastic news, the business was seemingly quite nice about all this so props to them!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;$FC: Yes hello $DS, the WiFi in this location is terrible, we need it fixed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DS: Hi $FC, unfortunately to cut costs we're running a WiFi bridge between the two buildings. It could be that the unit employed isn't handling the throughput too well, I'll log in and have a look .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI log into the bridge and oddly enough note that the traffic/bandwidth is rather flat-lined on 10Mb - almost like...they're not on GB ports. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;$DS: Yo, $IM I've got $FC complaining of this issue. I've had a look at the Ubiquiti and can see the traffic seemingly at capacity. What should we do here?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$IM: Let's re-route some network traffic and see what we can achieve. They're on 1GB port on the switch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I go about, turn off security cameras that go across the bridge (controller was back on the ESXi host we had to physical move to another VLAN) and thought, yeah that should reduce jitter. Few days pass, and another call from $FC about the same issue. \n\nI have a look and yeah, it's like it had capped at 10Mb. I do a little investigation and perform an iPerf on both ends, and cap the link (and actually lose connection). So, the fun begins!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;$DS: Hey $IM, I've jumped onto the switch and can see we've got both ends of the ubiquiti on GB ports (the model of this switch was wrong - this was not a full GB switch...), but I'm not confident they're getting throughput. I did an iPerf and that supports my theory.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;$IM: We will just need to get $TPC out there and run some private fiber, get it organized as soon as you can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFew days pass, and I'm doing some other work(s) involved in the area and I sever an old copper connection from 2 switches as it was no longer an issue. I get a call from the business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;$FC: Hey thanks for the work you did, we're all running at great speeds and we're super happy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$DS: No worries, glad the fiber helped. Did $TPC patch it through, do you know?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$FC: He hasn't been out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeird I thought, so let's have a look at this and see what happened. \n\nInitial findings:\n\n1. Fiber had not been run, as advised;\n2. Ubiquiti had greater throughput than before;\n\nSo I jump onto the switch(es) and do some work. Lo-and-behold I find some goodies:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Severing the copper reduced a spanning tree issue happening every 10-20 seconds\n2. An snmp community for printers was \"restored\" (somehow it seemed the SP was messing it up)\n3. By proxy of moving the copper, I was able to move the backup NAS to another location\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;$DS: Does this make much sense to you $IM, do you think this was a cause for over-burdening the switch/ubiquiti? Moving the NAS to another network to not require traversing the Ubiquiti and reducing STP have such an effect?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$IM: No, $TPC just plugged the Ubiquiti into 10M on the switch, it's not the full GB one you deployed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAhhhhhh dear. If I had taken another 10 minutes to do more investigation this would have been solved. Note this is over the course of a week or more, and my role doesn't cover networking (thus the limited testing and effort I put into it).",

I was one of the few guys that dealt fairly heavily with them and as such was asked to go and integrate a new business they had just taken over which happened to be a few hours away in a coastal town. There was 3 offices in the general area, 2 of which were linked via P2P wireless, the smaller of the 2 was actually a tiny house/cottage that was used by 2 or 3 of staff members on and off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I was in their main office, I got a call from the IT manager asking if we'd broken the connectivity out to the cottage, knowing well that everything was still fine on our end, I headed out to the house to check it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get there and see just how badly the place had been cabled, rough holes in the wall where there was 2 or 3 ethernet cables coming in to the \"comms rack\" which was basically a consumer router sitting on a filing cabinet. I plugged into the router and everything seemed OK. As I walked around the house though, I noticed quiet a few data points, but nowhere they ran back to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, it probably took me too long to realize, but the previous \"IT Guy\" had the place cabled had terminated all of the cables in the roof and connected them to a random unmanaged switch. I genuinely have no idea how long it had been sitting up there, likely 5+ years. Without a ladder I was kind of stumped about how I'd actually get into the roof to restart it when it hit me.\n\nReboot the house!\n\nGot the staff to shut their PC's down, flipped the breaker off/on and within a few minutes, everyone was working away happily again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say, I got a cabler out that afternoon (small town, everyone knows someone!) and dragged the cables down into a little comms rack, all neatly labeled and patched into their new Meraki kit.",

No big deal, right? It turns out that $CEO's big plan was to cut a vent in the outer wall of the server room, shut down the AC unit in the colder months, and save all kinds of money by not having to run the AC for that room year round! I immediately called $CEO about the matter and made it very clear about how bad of an idea this would be. Not only for keeping the temperature constant, but also humidity.  I also explained that the slight cost in not running this less than 10 year old, high efficiency AC unit would be greatly outdone by having to replace this equipment. Nothing like some condensation building up on your nice expensive VMWare server hardware, modular PoE switches, nice router, etc. Thankfully $CEO saw reason and I never heard about it again.",

        "text": "$User from a remote office was at our HQ today and lets me know that they'll be back next Wednesday with their new work phone so they don't have to use their personal one for work stuff anymore. Sounds like a logical person. Having an on-call cellphone *should* be covered by the company. IT doesn't handle cell phone accounts or anything related to the accounts. $User has access to company cards/accounts, can interact with the cell companies, all the required stuff.\n\n&gt;**$user**: I'll be back next Wednesday and I need you to get my new phone set up.\n\n&gt;**$me**: Ok. So, your company email, contacts, and calendar. Do you want the time sheet app too?\n\n&gt;**$user**: No. Like, set it up.\n\n&gt;**$me**: ...huh?\n\n&gt;**$user**: You know, get it working.\n\n&gt;**$me**: I think you need to go back to Verizon and have them get the phone setup with an account and activated.\n\n&gt;**$user**: Well I bought it online because I didn't want to have to go to the store. It should be ready for you to get it working.\n\n&gt;**$me**: No. You bought a phone. You skipped some steps that need to be done *before* involving me.\n\nI didn't want to give her a microsecond to suggest I help with other part of this process\n\n&gt;**$user**: Right. K. Well, I'll be back Wednesday so we'll see how things are then.\n\n*kill me now*\n\n&gt;**$user**: Also, sometimes I might share this phone with someone else when she is on-call for the weekend. So can you like... you know? Password protect my email? Like when she opens the email app it asks for my password before she sees anything. It doesn't matter if I see her's so don't worry about the other way around.\n\nThis on-call work is related to employee travel needs. Tickets, hotel/auto reservations, some of it international. If an issue comes up it needs to get dealt with ASAP\n\n&gt;**$me**: How about I make a specific mail account just for this and you start using it for all travel work. That way your employee email won't be on the phone and it's a non-issue.\n\n&gt;**$user**: Ummm... sometimes that might not be best for what we need. You know what I mean?\n\n*Yes. I know exactly what you mean when you describe it by saying absolutely nothing of worth.*\n\n&gt;**$me**: ...uh...sure... Submit a help desk ticket.\n\nUpdate: So she brought me the phone with an ~~activated~~ SIM card. Card wasn't inserted, but simple enough with a paperclip. No ticket, but forced her to get that done before I would set it up. Overall not too bad all things given. No problems doing the actual setup since it was a fresh account and nothing to transfer :D\n\nUpdate2: Well testing it more the SIM card isn't actually activated. It was talking to Verizon ok for some stuff, but when I tested calls it didn't work. She's in a meeting and it's not my job to do accounts. So this thing will just sit in a box until she takes care of the rest of it and hopefully it works at that point because it's not my problem anymore.",

        "text": "Hey TFTS!  LTL, FTP, on mobile, the whole schpeil.\n\nI've been tinkering with computers for most of my life, but only recently got a contractor job doing remote  software support at several facilities scattered across the U.S.  I've only been working for a few months, so not really any stories yet.  However, I recently had my 1st memorable user experience.\n\nRecently one of the sites experienced a power outage, causing anything not hooked into a UPS to go down.  While the servers were all safe (thankfully), the users all experienced an unexpected shutdown.  After the power came back up, I was busy checking up on the servers when I got a call.  **M** will be me, **U** will be the user.\n\n**M**: *answers call* \"Hello, this is CommodoreFiftyF-\"\n\n**U**: \"It didn't turn on on.\"\n\n**M**: \"...Padron me, what's not on?\"\n\n**U**: \"My computer, it didn't turn on!\"\n\nAh.  A user.  While I do talk to users, I'm technically not supposed to handle a \"computer not on\" issue.  But considering the power had come back only a few minutes ago, I was confident that pushing the power button would resolve her issue.  Easy enough.\n\n**M** \"Okay, ma'am.  I understand that your workplace lost power recently, but the power is now back on.  Unfortunately, computers can't turn on by themselves.  Could you do me a favor and push the power button to turn on your computer?\"\n\n**U**: \"**No.**\"\n\n*What*\n\n**M**: \"I'm sorry ma'am, did you say you won't turn on your computer?\"\n\n**U**: \"It's not my job to fix computers, its yours.  You're IT, not me!\"\n\n**M**: \"Ma'am, you're aware that you called remote support, right?\" (we have different numbers)\n\n**U**: \"Yes.  Why does that matter?  You're IT, come fix my computer!\"\n\n*More what*\n\nI take another glance at the name of the facility she's at.  It's actually the closest one to me, but still not exactly down the road.\n\n**M**: \"Ma'am, please understand.  I am in &lt;*state*&gt;.  You are in &lt;*other state*&gt;.  You are asking me to get in my car and drive six hours to a facility that, by the way, *I do not have authorization to enter*, in order to push a button on your computer.  Do you see my concern?\"\n\n**U**: \"***Well that's your job, isn't it??***\"\n\n*All of my what*\n\nI needed to get this woman off of my line.\n\n**M**: \"No ma'am, it is not my job.  My job contract says that I'm supposed to fix software issues.  Your problem is a hardware issue.  I'll notify on-site support that they need to come turn on your computer for you.  Have a good day.\" &lt;*click*&gt;",

        "text": "This is my first story on this subreddit, I'm sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language.\n\nA couple of years ago I was working as a backend developer for an European bank. I wasn't in support per se, but the development teams often helped the support people if there was a problem with one of our \"babies\". My team's responsibility was the online banking system.\n\nOne day our manager came by with one of the execs, and they both clearly weren't happy. We knew that if the latter guy ever graced us with his presence, there was an urgent problem. Most of the time, it was a lot of fuss over nothing, but there was a slight probability that something could really be wrong, and then heads were likely to roll, so no pressure there.\n\nThey told us to check a ticket, freshly forwarded to us by support. I opened it, and it curiously contained a scan of a handwritten letter by an obviously angry customer. It went something like this:\n\n&gt; Dear banking people,  \n&gt; I have just closed all my accounts in your bank and I am already working with my lawyer to sue you. I tried using your awful online banking system and, after logging in, I was presented with someone else's account! I could se everything - the balances, the transaction amounts, everything, and they were not mine. The accounts all belonged to a *Xxxx Yyyy*, not me.  \n&gt; If I could see another person's data, it is definitely possible that someone could access mine. This is unacceptable, so look forward to hearing from my lawyer.\n\nAnd then I knew why the exec came by - this looked clearly like a really, really important security issue. I mean, if you can access someone else's account in an online banking system, that is supposed to be very secure, it's not a problem, it's a scandal, probably nationwide. So, the tensions went really high then and there.\n\nSo we started searching for the problem. The customer sadly didn't provide us with a date of when this happened, so we had to go through a lot of data to pinpoint a failure. Frontend logs, backend logs, database logs, etc. While my coworkers were going through them, I thought two things to myself:  \n- The customer wrote a letter, which had to take some time to be delivered, probably around two days, and no one else reported the same catastrophic bug during this period  \n- The name *Xxxx Yyyy* looked extremely bland, just like a name you would use on a...  \nMe: Guys, what is the name of the user in the demo service?  \nCoworker: It's... &lt;mass realization occurs&gt; *Xxxx Yyyy*\n\nAfter some quick checks we confirmed that the customer accidentaly accessed the demo service instead od the actual online banking. The link was nowhere near the login ones, and the customer actually didn't even provide the login or password before, just went straight to the demo, freaked out, went to a local branch and closed all of their accounts in the bank. We had some laughs and sent out our answer to the customer support.\n\nSadly, I don't know how further contact with the customer went. But the UI was redesigned so that the demo service was not directly accessible from the login page.",

        "text": "I've been doing the IT work for a local hotel for almost 13 years.  The hotel has changed owners 5 times in the 13 years with the most recent owner taking over this last year.\n\nThe fourth owner decided to use \"their IT people\" to install access points to provide their hotel customers Wi-Fi.  Something I had been recommending to the third owner for years.  The competing company only installed two access points for 50 rooms that were very spread out.   The worst part?  They weren't wired, basically two glorified Wi-Fi extenders for an entire hotel.\n\nThey started getting 1-star reviews saying that their internet was garbage.  The competing company was fired, and they called us to fix it all.  I recommend a proper setup with multiple wired access points to cover each area of the hotel.  They didn't like the price and would only authorize wiring the two access points that they currently had.  The also had us throttle each connection to 500 Kbps down per user.  \n\nI had them sign off on the work with clear warnings that this will not solve their issues and people will continue to complain but the owner didn't seem to care about online reviews if it was going to \"cost so much\".\n\nDuring the process of changing from the fourth owner to the fifth owner I came in for consultation to give the new owners a rundown on all the IT systems and where the fourth owner stored passwords etc.  During the meeting the fifth owner asked if there was something we could do to stop all the online 1-star reviews complaining about the internet.\n\nI showed them the bid I had given the fourth owner with updated prices for hardware and they both agreed it was time to do it and that they would split the cost of labor and parts.  \n\nFinished the job and it was working perfectly, however I made a stupid mistake and never got the new owners to sign off on their half of the work.  Surprise surprise they refused to pay their half, saying it was the fourth owners issue and not theirs.  We went back and forth, and it ended up getting a little nasty.  They finally told us to come out and remove half the equipment, they would get by with half the access points.\n\nI warned them that would lead to terrible internet for their customers, but they didn't care.  Went out, took out half the access points which looked like garbage because we aren't fixing holes and tucking cables if they won't pay for our labor and left.\n\nA week later they are calling us frantic because they are getting front desk complaints, more 1-star online reviews and are about to lose a large contract because of the internet access.   I gave them a new emergency bid at 3 times the original labor plus labor for removing all the access points and demanded they also pay for the original install labor.\n\nThey begrudgingly agree, and everything is back up and running exactly as it was when we originally finished the job.  In the end their labor cost went from around a thousand dollars to almost five thousand.  \n\nI wonder if the 6th owner will use my company too.\n\nEdit - tl;dr\n\nNew hotel owners refuse to pay their half of a access point installation job.  We fight over labor/parts, so they tell us to tear out half the equipment.  We comply and their internet continues to be hot garbage and they almost lose a lucrative housing contract.  They call us frantic to have it fixed and we redo the work at 3 times labor rate plus original install and removal labor.  Job goes from around 1k in labor to 5k.\n\n[The saga continues, part 2.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9i2e1o/hotel_wifi_shenanigans_part_2/)\n\n[And now there is a part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9iu9l8/hotel_wifi_shenanigans_part_3/\n).\n\n[A tiny update 3.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9kid4g/hotel_wifi_shenanigans_part_31/)\n",

The days are generally the 1st/15th of the month, except when they fall on a weekend or i'm not in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI install these updates the day before, and send a warning email the morning of the day before to al staff warning them of the downtime and that there is no point in coming in expecting to do work as nothing will be online.

It's my job to write it up and explain it to our client, fnordco. I make sure there are appropriate caveats in the documents explaining that we only identified potential vulnerabilities and that further validation would be required.     \n  \nI'm outlining the draft when I get a chat request from Rufus, the sales rep who sold this thing:  \n  \nRufus:\"Hey\"  \n  \nme:\"What's up? I'm finishing this deliverable for fnordco. I assume you'd like the recommendation list to tee up for the after-work pitch\"  \n  \nRufus:\"Sounds great. Did you find anything in the cloud?\"  \n  \nme:\"Um, what?\"  \n  \nRufus:\"Don't tell me you missed that\"  \n  \nme:\"I asked for the SOW (statement of work), but got a scope doc from one of the testers\"  \n  \nRufus:\"It wasn't in the SOW\"  \n  \nme:\"It wasn't in the scope either. Where would I find what we promised? fnordco?\"  \n  \nRufus:\"Just go out and see if they've got some open S3 buckets\"  \n  \nme:\"Righty-ho.\"     \n  \nI alternate between finishing the deliverable and google dorking for fnordco open shares. I find an open one with their name in the URL, but there's nothing valuable - dummy test data in .xls and .csv formats.  \n  \n   \nI finish the deliverable, mentioning the open bucket and send it off to the client along with an invite for the readout.  \n  \nThe next day, I get an email from Rufus, cc'ing my new boss, his boss and one or two people I don't know.  \n  \nPer Rufus, the client has \"grave concerns\" about the deliverable. In order to show that we're taking their feelings seriously, I'm going to travel to fnordco's headquarters and do the readout in person. Anything they don't like, we're going to review to make sure they're happy.  \n  \nThis isn't going to be fun.   \n  \nI travel to fnordco's HQ and sit in a conference room. I'm reminded of waiting outside the Principal's office in junior high.   \n  \nMy meeting is scheduled for an hour from now. I have to join a call with a few people from my firm for last minute 'alignment' to make sure nobody says anything stupid.  \n  \nThe room is equipped with an oddball conference system, made by a company you never think of when it comes to speakerphones. My experience with the interface tells me why:  \n  \n\"Press Up six two to mute. Press Up six three to transfer the call\"  \n  \nTo make matters worse, the generic recorded voices have been replaced with a C-list celebrity that fnordco used for advertising. I can't place the person, but I'm sure the celebrity had done their time on Star Trek or some other long running series. The voice sounds like Chloë Sevigny was asked to do a bad Minnesota accent, don'tcha know.  \n  \nI'm finally joined by a few members of fnordco's security staff, led by Janice, a Senior Director. She seems annoyed that I'm the only person from my firm who has seen fit to put my head in the bear's mouth.    \n  \nI start by introducing my co-workers on the call, to show our commitment to making fnordco happy. Janice's patience is wearing thin.  \n  \nJanice:\"We can read the meeting invite. Let's move on\"  \n  \nme:\"Ok, we identified a number of issues that you may want to remediate\"  \n  \nJanice:\"How many of them were tested manually?\"  \n  \nme:\"Per the scope, none\"  \n  \nJanice (looking shocked):\"Really? Why?\"  \n  \nI'm looking at the speakerphone in the hopes that someone else has a better answer than I do. Sadly, it's silent.  \n  \nme:\"I was informed that this was a special request from your side\"  \n  \nJanice sees me looking at the phone. She reaches over in an attempt to mute it while looking at me. She starts a fight with the keypad.  \n  \nPhone:\"Beep Beep Beep. I don't recognize that command\"  \n  \nPhone:\"Beep Beep Beep. I don't recognize that command\"   \n   \nPhone:\"Beep Beep. Please enter an extension to ...\"  \n  \nPhone:\"Beep Beep Beep. I don't recognize that command\"  \n  \nJanice, having lost her patience, grabs the conference phone, slams it on the table a few times to get its attention, then disconnects the network cable. She then shoves the phone across the table, where it almost slides off the edge.  \n  \nJanice:\"You're telling me that we ordered this useless test intentionally?\"  \n  \nme:\"That's my understanding\"  \n  \nJanice:\"Who?\"  \n  \nme:\"I don't know, but I'll find out for you\"  \n  \nJanice:\"You're not getting off that easy. You didn't report the PII leak\"  \n  \nme:\"Are you talking about the files in the unsecure bucket? We found it, but it was clearly test data, not a significant risk\"  \n  \nOne of Janice's staff pipes up:  \n  \nStaff person (with a wolfish smile):\"Do you think a leak of European users' identities is low risk?\"  \n  \nme:\"I'm familiar with the requirements under 95/46/EC, but that doesn't extend to test data\"  \n  \nJanice:\"And you _know_ that it was all test data?\"  \n  \nme:\"Absolutely. ssnape@hogwarts.ac.uk was a giveaway. I will give whomever entered Hodor@hodor.hodor points. That was a good one\"  \n  \nThankfully, that even got Janice to laugh for a brief moment. Eventually we figured out that some VP had a bad pen-test experience in the past where a core service was offline for a few days and they went directly to Legal to change the contract. We finished the pen-test as a 'retest' after that all got sorted out.  \n  \n   \nThere is one more story, about how we inadvertently knocked a whole region offline during a test, but that'll have to wait...     \n  \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \n",

        "text": "LTL FTP yada yada, please tell me if this is wrong here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs seemingly everyone else here I'm not techsupport by definition, but I study \"something with computers\" (digital philology, basically humanities with a bit of computer assisted statistical analysis included) so I'm that guy in the family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also really interested in networking, so when my Grandparents IPS issued Modem-Router-Wifi Combo device failed, it was of course my job to come up with a better solution.\n\nSince they have a 70s beton House with exactly 0 Ethernet wiring place I had to go for more than just one AP. I opted for the Unifi Mesh System, as the Unifi Gear has served me well at work and at home (and the remote management would make it easier for me to troubleshoot from the distance). The initial setup worked perfect, just as the marketing material would dream of. Everything worked and all devices were brought over to the new Wifi and on the first day I went to bed happy. But of course, if everything works great on the first attempt, it is just a delusion, and something has to fail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next morning I wake up and one of my APs shows disconnected. Starting troubleshooting with the usual, check cables, check power, unplug, reboot, change power adapter, but to no avail, its stays offline, but weirdly Wifi still works. Everyone connected, can still browse the internet as if nothing happened. But it doesnt show up anywhere. The router doesnt even see it. Pinging its ip directly gives a timeout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I go about my day googling the error and the forums, but nothing brings back my AP. So as a last resort I start a support chat with Ubiquiti, expecting not much from it. My previous support calls with HP for a printer and Microsoft Office were all pretty disappointing and basically ended in \"buy a new one, that'll work\". But not this time. I have to say Ubiquitis support was superb. After waiting in queue for 10 minutes I got an agent, that went through every troubleshooting step with me again, but to no avail. It left the agent puzzled too and he admitted. As a last resort I wanted to hardwire everything, and upon connecting my laptop to hardwire everything popped up and connected with no issue. Running the Unifi Controller of of a Laptop connected to the mesh system apparently caused the second Mesh Point to not get connected. I felt pretty stupid, that I didnt come up with that earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Wasted techsupports time for 2h because I never checked if hardwiring might solve the problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR2: 70s Buildings are horrible for Wifi and drilling holes for wires, don't buy one or expect a Wifi-AP per room to keep coverage acceptable.",

I ask $User the error message and $User replies \"It wont let me!\" Cue full body sigh....\n\n\nI go with $User to the PC to see what the problem is. Watch $User log in and instantly click OK on the error message. Ask $User to let me see the message next time and watch her log in again. This time I was watching over $Users shoulder before the message was dismissed and I caught a brief glimpse of the word \"logon\". Now I know the problem! (The network port in the room is a little dodgey)\n\n\nTake $User back to the room I am working in, remote onto the server and ask $User to put in a new password twice, once in the top, once in the bottom. (A sign of how low my expectations had become). Guessed who decided to put their old password and new password in the boxes? That's too easy, guess how many times. Did anyone guess 3? If so you won, a portion of my pain.\n\n\nBack to $Users PC and finally get her logged in with only small nail imprints on my palms and $User turns round and asks \"Where's my email\" It was at this point I felt an urge to examine the closet wall very closely and very quickly.\n\n\nShow $User how to access office.com. Add a shortcut called \"EMAIL\" to a their desktop as it was \"too complicated\" Does $User remember their email password or email address? Of course not!  To make things worse, due to an email change, all schools use the same @company email so giving me access to make changes to my school's emails means giving me access to ALL emails the Helpdesk are the only ones that can help her, for now.\n\n\nBack at my tablet and I get an email with $Users email info. Back to ~~hell~~ $User and log in for them and show them the password reset screen. \"In the two ermpty boxes, please type what you want your new password to be, 8 characters, capital, number, blah blah\" They managed it 4th try.\n\n\ntl:dr There are no fingerprints deep under water, nothing to tie one to a crime and if you seek vengeance, all you need are instruments of pain.",

Usually is a quick indicator for who our  \"frequent flyers\" are gonna be.\n\nEveryone gets an Onboarding sheet that has all the new user info necessary:\n\n\\- username\n\n\\- email\n\n\\- SSO site\n\n\\- temp password and complexity requirements\n\nWe bring our computers along for the odd \"special user\" that  will end up needing a reset before leaving orientation. I wish this was  about one of them.\n\nThis lady puts the temp password in, sees the \"you must reset\" and just sits there.  So I wait a few minutes and start walking around the room to see who hasn't made it in and asked her if she needed help.  She didn't know.  I tell her that she will need to reset her password so click where it says OK (almost verbatim to whats on the screen).  So she puts a personal password in (doesn't meet requirements) and neglects to put it in the \"verify password\" section and clicks OK.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Your new password and verify password fields did not match\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tell her to click OK and we try again.  I specify, you need to put the password in twice which ensures that it's been typed correctly.  She does this, but this time she doesn't put the old password into the top field as it's cleared when you fail to reset.  I try to stop her but she clicks OK anyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Your Old Password was incorrect\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRinse and repeat, we try again.  She's getting frustrated because of course she is.  This time her password doesn't meet complexity requirements.  So I point to the guide sheet and say:\n\nChud:  You're going to want to make sure that your password satisfies these requirements.  I'd recommend adding a special character like an exclamation at the end if you have trouble coming up with a brand new password.\n\nEU:  Umm my password does satisfy those requirements.  It's not working.  I don't know why it's not taking it.\n\nChud:  Ok, I understand.  Would you please try again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Your Password does not meet length or complexity requirements -  No action from the end user.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChud:  I'm going to have to recommend you try again with a longer more complex password.\n\nthis time it goes through.  I count my lucky stars and hope that it's a fluke and that if she's this bad, she also is too bad to figure out the ticketing system (no dice)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBONUS:\n\nan hour goes by and \"I can't print\" ticket comes in from her.  We have secure printing so I already know the issue.  I go to her desk and of course, when she was prompted to set her PIN she just clicked wildly until it went away and we had to reset it.  I explain why this is necessary and see the glazed blank stare.  I get it, IT's not people, I am just a dispenser of function for machines.  Essentially a Waiter who serves functionality.\n\nWhat I don't get is how people will see a pop up and just click anywhere and everywhere to get it to go away \\*OR\\* just throw their hands up and give up.  If you don't know, read.  Nearly 4 years of this is enough.

        "text": "Hi TFTS, first time poster, also on a phone, so don't judge me.\n\n\n\nI'm actually a student, so I don't carry stuff on me like a tech support person, but this time, I was called in by a teacher I know in a school I used to go to. I had the day off, so I though I might go there and fix whatever is going wrong. I arrived and was greeted by tons of friendly faces.\n\n$Me: Hey $Teacher, I'm here. What's wrong?\n\n$Teacher: The internet is down, could you take a look?\n\n$Me: Sure, one second!\n\nI sit down at the first desktop I see, fire up Chrome and open google. Everything loads.\n\n$Me: I don't see a problem, are you-\n\n$Teacher: Oh no, it only happens on laptops! And I'll also say, it's been happening for about 20 days, ever since $Contractedtechsupportguy repaired our printer. He changed the toner.\n\n$Me: Aha! Let me look.\n\nI look at the first laptop in view and see that it has an IP. I fire up Chrome and am greeted by a \"No route\" error page generated by the router. I try logging in, but the default password doesn't work, noone knows the password and the $Contractedtechsupportguy is nowhere to be found.\n\n$Me: OK, it seems like I'll need to perform maintenance on your router. Where is it?\n\n$Teacher: Oh, I have no idea.\n\nI pull up a wifi analyzer app on my phone and find the wifi AP by comparing the dbm in different places.\n\n$Me: Hey $Teacher, come with me. I don't want an incident to happen and me to be blamed. (Incidents are way too common here).\n\nAfter 1 minute of orientating myself in (half of) their WAY TOO COMPLICATED networking setup, I see the problem. The WAN ethernet cable is connected to a networking switch that every wired computer is connected to, but the cable from the switch to the AP is gone. Not there. Absolutely gone. I also notice there's a new, sealed AP on the teacher's desk. I tell $Teacher to remind $Contractedtechsupportguy about it, but now for the temporary fix.\n\n$Me: I'll need to go home to fix this.\n\n$Teacher: Oh it's ok, you don't have to make up excuses, you're not a student here, go whenever you need.\n\n$Me: No, I'll fix it, but I really need to go home now.\n\nI get home (it's a 2 minute walk) and grab the only ethernet cable that's sitting unused. It only has 2 pairs of wires but it'll do. Once I get it, I sprint back.\n\nAfter explaining why I'm back so soon, I go to the AP, get out my yellow cable (all the others are white), plug it in and it works. Since it's only 100Mbit, I tell the teachers to request a new cable from the $Contractedtechsupportguy whenever he gets there. He gets there in 2 days, changes the printer cartridge (yes, it ran out in 22 days) and replaces the cable. I get told to get my cable, I do that, everything works, everything is great. End of story.\n\n\n\nOr at least, in theory.\n\nIn reality though, I get called in about a week to help them with internet again and I have no idea why it just stopped working.\n\n$Me: Hey $Teacher, what's wrong now?\n\n$Teacher: No computers downstairs have internet, save for the laptops. (Those use wifi)\n\n$Me: I'll look, but I probably can't fix that one. I'll see what I can do though.\n\n$Teacher: Oh, one more thing, the $Contractedtechsupportguy added a little thingy here. What is it?\n\n$Me: That's a switch, $Genericswitchdescription. Thank you for pointing that out, it might help later.\n\nI look at the infrastructure downstairs. It looks pretty simple, one CAT5 cable from upstairs and two switches, of which I only found one at first. I check with a borrowed laptop and sure enough, I don't get an IP. (MAC address filtering is not a thing, nor are domains) Static IP doesn't fix it.\n\n$Me: I don't think I can fix this, sorry.\n\n$Teacher: Bummer. Can you fix the directors PC though?\n\n$Me: I don't think so... I can try though.\n\nI walk into the office and look at where the ethernet cable goes. Sure enough, I find the second switch and it has been... unplugged from the power supply?\n\n$Me: Aby idea who did this?\n\n$Director: Nope, no idea. Could you plug it in?\n\nI look around and find it hidden 2 meters from the switch. I plug it in and the computer suddenly has internet. But I am curious.\n\n$Me: Your computer's working. But now I want to know why the other won't.\n\nI try plugging the WAN cable from the switch into the PC and BOOM, INTERNET! Turns out two of the ports on the switch don't work. I report it and go. Everything has worked so far.\n\nAlso, I got a job offer from them! They literally said \"We want a new tech support guy please!\"\n\nAlso, it turns out the $Contractedtechsupportguy stole the ethernet cable in the first part of the story, because he was missing one on another site (He did a scream test though, so...). And for a totally unrelated reason, the NAS was also disconnected from the switch, however, they hadn't used it in years (literally), so noone cared.\n\n\n\n\nTl;Dr: The tech support guy broke everything, so I got a job offer!\n\nEdit: added clarification\nEdit 2: Added interesting details",

The Button you are hovering over... what does it say?\n\nShe looks at the screen...Silence ...\n\n**$OL**: Thank you ! you can... leave now.\n\n**$Me**: Yes... You are welcome.\n\n\n\n\nSecond story:\n\n\n**$DTL** : Development Team Lead - from some major government projects (Mind you; just boring office and Data stuff)\n\n**$ST**: Service Technician \n\n**$SG**: Security Guy - Has no IT knowledge.\n\n\nA few days after the issue with **$OL** i was working pretty late in the tech office. I needed to write down an guideline how to handle minor IT problems. (Yes this Guide tackles every:\"Printer is not working or PC is not working problem\")\nHonestly it properly helped just a few people... because the majority of the people did not read it. As its easier to just call us.\n\nBut well i was working and my **$SV** told me that an **$ST** will arrive shortly and change the AC unit in our Server room. And i should let him in.\n\nHe also told me he knows what he is doing so i don't need to worry. Mr. **$SG** will be escorting him so you don't need to look after them.\n\n\nAfter 20 min he arrived and i opened the keycard protected server room. And Informed him just to be sure : This room has a gas controlled fire suppression system. If the Alarm sounds leave immediately.\nAnd please don't touch the servers. He acknowledges and i continue my work for the next 30min.\n\n\nUntil my phone rings: Its an Emergency number so i pick it up immediately after i notice it.\n\n\n**$Me**: &gt;Good evening this is **$Me** from Tech Support - what is the emergency?\n\n$DTL: &gt;Yes, this is **$DTL** our Production servers went all down right now!\n\n(\"What??HOW? We have batteries, emergency backups and a giant diesel generator that automatically kicks in! And i havent recieved any Server mails? So lets check the Server Monitoring)\n\n**$Me**: &gt;Please wait a second as i check the system. -&gt; Mute\n\nI access the main program but it tells me : \"can't connect\"\n\n**$Me**: &gt;Okay that's odd.\n\nI ping the server : Timeout...\n\n(\"Oh-oh...\")\n\n**$Me**: &gt;UnMute: Yes there seems to be an issue with our Servers i will call you back asap.\n\n**$DTL**: Thank you.\n\nI run to the server room to find the **$ST** Listening to some beats on a radio, and charging his drill. The Server room is quite beside the music... its such an panic inducing silence (: the lack of the familiar hum from the fans/AC).\n\n**$ME**: &gt;WHAT THE HELL? Why is everything dead ?!?\n\n**$ST**: &gt;Is it ?\n\n**$SG**: &gt;What? He was just connecting and disconnecting cables...\n\nHe turns off his music. And i see that his portable radio is connected to the special outlet for the servers.\n\n**$ME** &gt;in disbelieve: Did you disconnect that power cord there ?\n\n**$ST**: &gt;Hm ? Oh yes i did. There was no other cable to hear music and listen to the football match in a few minutes.\n\n**$ME**: &gt;You just disconnected the servers and put your radio on a fail-safe outlet.\n\n**$ST**: &gt;And? The servers have batteries right? That's what they told me.\n\n**$Me** already calling the **$SV** and reconnecting the main power cord.\n\n**$ME**: &gt;Yes they are below this building... and not inside the servers. Also WHY did you disconnect all of the power cables??\n\n**$ST** now getting a bit more white then before: &gt;So i powered down the servers?\n\n**$ME**: &gt;Yes, indeed you did.\n\n**$SG**: &gt;Damn.\n \nSo :\nthe Drill was put into an fail-safe outlet disconnecting an server farm.\n\nthe radio was put also into an fail-safe outlet and disconnecting the other server.\n\nOnly the other two where still running. \n\nAfter **$SV** arrived and royally scolded the **$ST** and **$SG** i was busy checking backups, restarting some processes that don't start automatically and spend hours in there... Got like 2h sleep for the next day\n\nThese where some interesting times... But all that changed my view of the people in all of this offices regardless of government or industry - for ever. (It helped me a ton in my job now. I work as a IT Consultant for Requirements engineering, project management and QA. I can already tell what stupid things costumers will do with our software apps and products... and try to tackle these issues with my dev team before we go to prod.)\n\n\nHope you enjoyed my two story's. \n\nEdit: Typo",

        "text": "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....  \nWell, at least a couple of weeks back. A month? Almost a month.\n\nI got a phone call - a customer needed help. A co-worker had been out to see them the previous day, and had established that the hard drive of their single POS¹ system had died. Fortunately, we keep base images of these things, so it was a simple matter to get a new drive imaged and head out to the site to install it. Easy enough - except the customer's site was about two hours drive away, and the images were stored at Head Office, five hours driving in the opposite direction.  \nSo my co-worker had reported the incredibly urgent requirement for a new hard drive to Head Office, who *immediately* leapt into action and - as quickly as is humanly possible - waited until business hours the following day to image a hard drive and send it via same day air delivery to me.²\n\nWhy me? Because I drew the short straw.\n\n---\n\n¹ - Decipher this acronym however you like. \"Point of Sale\" is one possibility that works.\n\n² - I assume because it's easier to bill the customer for same day delivery fees than it is to bill them for after hours pre-staging/imaging work.\n\n---\n\nI picked up the parcel from the airport and headed to the site. Fortunately, I arrived just as I clicked over into time-and-a-half, so at least I got to clock up some sweet, sweet overtime hours.\n\nFor various reasons that have yet to be adequately explained, the new image must be activated on site, using the Certificate of Authenticity (CoA) on the customer's computer. This normally isn't an issue.  \nTonight, however, would be different - the CoA on the customer's computer was for Windows XP, and the image used Windows 7. Naturally, step 1 (Activate Windows) failed.\n\nUnfortunately, the old SSD was completely dead - I'd used NirSoft's ProduKey to extract the Windows key from an old registry hive before, but it was not going to possible this time.\n\nWith little other recourse remaining, I called the helpdesk, or in this case, the \"help\"desk.\n\n&gt; HD: Hello, HellDesk speaking.\n\n&gt; ME: Hey HD, it's Gambatte. I'm down at the customer in *{location}*, I'm told you're expecting my call?\n\n&gt; HD: Oh yeah, I am.\n\n&gt; ME: Cool. So just before we get started, I have to let you know that Windows isn't activated - the CoA on this computer is for Windows XP, not Windows 7.\n\n&gt; HD: Oh. Isn't there another CoA?\n\n&gt; ME: No - I've pulled off all of the covers and looked everywhere - I took some photos, I'm emailing them to you now. The XP CoA was exactly where I expected the CoA to be, so unless the Windows 7 one is physically hidden under the motherboard or something similarly ridiculous, I can't find it.\n\n&gt; HD: Huh. Well, we've got some time to get that done, so I guess I can just activate it tomorrow.\n\n&gt; ME: Thirty days, isn't it, until Windows Genuine Advantage starts doing hourly shutdowns and whatnot?\n\n&gt; HD: Yeah, something like that. I'll deal with it tomorrow, during working hours. Right now, let's just get through the configuration process so they can get running again.\n\n&gt; ME: Sounds good - I'm not leaving until the system is up and running, and then I've got a two hour drive home to look forward to after that. So the sooner, the better.\n\nBecause overtime is nice, but I actually like spending time with my wife and kids.\n\n---\n\nTime passed. Eventually, the system was up and running, or close enough to it that the store could open the following day. Several times, I had to disconnect in order to check something or perform some esoteric process. Finally, I reached the ultimate call of the night.\n\n&gt; HD: ...Well, with that test complete, we're done!\n\n&gt; ME: Sweet. What about...\n\n&gt; HD: ...yeah, I'll deal with Windows and *{other outstanding issues}* tomorrow.\n\n&gt; ME: All good - I'll let the owner know that we're done, and get on the road.\n\nAnd I did.  \nAnd little over two hours later, I got home.\n\n---\n---\n\nBut alas, this tale does not end there.\n\n---  \n---\n\nSlightly more recently, and about a week later...\n\n&gt; Sales Guru (SG): Hey G, didn't you go to *{location}* last week?\n\n&gt; ME: Yeah, I racked up over 6 hours of overtime on that job. Why?\n\n&gt; SG: They're down again.\n\n&gt; ME: WTF?!?\n\n&gt; SG: Apparently they're saying something about a Windows key? Did you activate Windows?\n\n&gt; ME: *(trying to recall, because it happened before breakfast)* ...No. They had an XP key, not Win7. I let HD know when he remoted in to configure it; he said he'd take care of it during business hours.\n\n&gt; SG: Huh. Maybe he hasn't got around to it.\n\n&gt; ME: I mean, maybe it's unrelated to the issues they're having? It's meant to be a 30 day activation period, right?\n\nDoes that even work with an image? What if the image was captured on day 27 of the 30 day period? What if the image was captured a year ago? Dammit, I don't know. I have suspicions; I think I might know, but I don't **know** know - not for absolutely certain.\n\n&gt; ME: But at the very least, it's something that can be eliminated pretty quickly - and remotely, too.\n\n&gt; SG: It doesn't matter, HD said he would take care of it, and he hasn't. I'm going to have to call the Area Manager.\n\n&gt; ME: Okay; let me know if there's something I can do to help out. I don't know what it would be, but if there's something...\n\n&gt; SG: I'll let you know.\n\nI carried on to a completely unrelated job in desperate need of completion.\n\n---\n\nA couple of hours later, as I was just finalizing the other job, my phone sounded an alert - I had a new email. Working on the assumption that it might be something important, I quickly read it.\n\n&gt; TO: Gambatte\n\n&gt; CC: Sales Guru, Help Desk General Email, Area Manager's Boss\n\n&gt; Hi Gambatte\n\n&gt; We have grabbed a new Win7 software licence label from our stock and the helpdesk will activate Win7. I understand you couldn't find a Win7 Licence on the PC which leaves us perplexed.  \n\n&gt; We'll work out later who we can charge for the license. In the meantime, I'll send you the licence label to affix to the computer at *{location}*.\n\n&gt; Regards  \nArea Manager\n\nDid he just... He did! He just threw me under the goddamned bus! \"I understand you couldn't find a Win7 license\" insinuates that I am the one at fault; and to put it in an email CC'd not just to the entire Help Desk, but also Sales Guru, who I see almost every single day, and also to his own boss - second only to the CTO - to boot!?!?\n\nTo say I was annoyed would be severely understating the situation.  \nFortunately, this is not my first rodeo; this affront shall not go unpunished.\n\n&gt; TO: Area Manager et al\n\n&gt; CC: Sales Guru, Help Desk General Email, Area Manager's Boss\n\n&gt; Area Manager\n\n&gt; Please find attached to this email the photos that I sent to HD on the evening in question (`date redacted`). As you can clearly see, the Certificate of Authenticity is for Windows XP, not Windows 7. As per standard procedure, I attempted to activate Windows via phone using the CoA key anyway; however, as expected, the activation failed as a Windows XP key is not valid for activating Windows 7.  \nI reported this to HD at the time, both in writing and during our phone conversation, to which he responded that he would take care of it during business hours the following day.\n\n&gt; I will be passing *{location}* at least twice in the next week for *{previously scheduled other jobs}*; if I have the new Certificate of Authenticity in hand, I can affix it while passing.\n\n&gt; ~~Trying to throw me under the bus, [Mister Falcon?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWjFNMDOKw4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m8s) Bitch, I keep receipts!!!~~\n\n&gt; Regards - G.Ambatte\n\nGiven the intended audience, I reconsidered and deleted the last line before I hit SEND. I probably never actually intended to send it, but at least it was quite cathartic to write it out.\n\nI returned to the job at hand, and waited for a response - but none ever came.  \nIn some ways, I was almost disappointed - a small part of me almost hoped that the Area Manager would double down, and try to throw me under the bus again.\n\nBecause if the photos weren't going to be enough, I had a second ace up my sleeve: I record every call made to my work phone³ for my own infernal purposes. So I had recordings of not one, but two calls where HD had told me he would take care of activating Windows.\n\n---\n\n³ Here, at least, it is legal to record conversations that you are engaged in without having to notify the other parties; even more so when the conversation would be considered \"on the record\", where it would be reasonable to expect notes to be taken - say, for example, a conversation between co-workers, each on work-provided phones, about a work issue; particularly where one of the co-workers is providing instructions and/or advice to the other.  \nUltimately, the courts decide the admissibility of each recording on it's own merits; this was all hashed out in the media a few years ago, when some fairly high profile politicians were caught out covertly recording/being covertly recorded by other parties. Of course, the Court of Public Opinion has a much lower bar for admissibility of evidence...\n\n---\n\nA few days ago, I received a Certificate of Authenticity in a courier bag. No note, no paperwork - just a sticker. It's currently on the dashboard of my work vehicle, waiting for the next time I drive past.\n\nEarlier this week, I signed a new contract; as of next week, I will no longer report to Area Manager, but rather to Area Manager's boss directly.",

LTL FTP. \n\nStarted my career in IT about a year ago after leaving uni and landed a job in the Healthcare sector last December. \n\nI love my job and my team, it’s also on the same site as my girlfriend that happens to be a nurse at the hospital I work at. Naturally this means that any problems the ward has, I tend to deal with.\n\nFast forward to last night and we’re laying in bed. I’m having my nice unwind talk with her about work when she turns to me and says “one of our drug room computers isn’t working”.\n\nNow for any of you that don’t know, the drug room computers are the only PC’s on the ward that you can track and issue drugs from. If one of them breaks, it’s a big deal.\n\nSo I reply to her saying “oh, what’s happened?”\n\n“Well I tapped on to the reader* and the screen was just black”\n\n(*i should also note that most wards are equipped with card readers that allow users to quickly tap their smart card and be logged on to a virtual machine) \n\nI go through the usual troubleshooting.\n\n“Any error messages?” “No”\n“Any flashing lights on the card reader or machine?” “No”\n“... was there a light on the power button?”\n\n“No”\n\nFUUUUUU-. \n\nI ask her how long this machine has been out of action and she says about 5 days. I kindly ask her if she knows of anyone that has tried to turn the machine on or logged a call with IT. She replies “no.”\n\nAt this point I say to her “please try turn the machine on when you’re in tomorrow. If it’s broken I will log the call for you and send someone out” \n\nTODAY I get a text from her saying and I quote:\n\n“Btw that broken machine in the drug room... it was switched off”.\n\nI understand that nurses are busy but just press the on button! If it’s broken after that then sure, leave a note and report it when someone is free!\n\nI’ll add that before this I’d mentioned to everyone in the office that I’ve taught my missus to be ‘very tech savvy’ and ‘she’d be really helpful when logging a call’\n\nOh how wrong I was.

So I decided to go back.\n\nI get there and now there are 2 cars in the driveway when before there were none. So obviously the guy lied about being home.\n\n(Sadly I'm to cowardly to call him on it)\n\nAlso the \"no signal\" issue on his monitor turned out to be because he shoved an HDMI cable into a displayport.",

        "text": "Hi Everyone!   \nI'm back with a notable update to our [fast-paced action-packed cutover saga!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8swwd1/the_cutover_part_2_250_is_an_important_number/?ref=readnext)\n\nDramatis Personae:  \n$Tornado - Affectionately known as the fastest technician alive. (I walk very fast)  \n$ITTC - Internet Telephony Technical Company Inc. it is a poorly managed ISP who does everything possible to make the last mile difficult.  \n$Fails - ITTC Sales rep, but more like a fail rep.  \n$CIO - Hero extraordinaire, loves food, more like the Acme VP of Bad ideas.\n\n  \nWe start with the loudest sound in the world!   \nAs silence from the ISP is deafening, we'd cast service requests and status updates into the abyss which were routed to /dev/null just past the DNS blackhole. \n\nWe suspect CIO has put ITTC into a special mode where $Fails will only talk to us after $VP approves the request. Usually ISP's want to keep your business, but this group is doing everything possible to encourage us not to use them but someone somewhere who makes very important decisions thought that this project was a good idea.\n\nWe tightened the screws try to encourage our fail-sales rep and technical coordinator to finish installing/fix the voice and internet circuits as upper management was very upset at the resolution time for these projects.\n\nSo we call, email, send a few pigeons, spike the line (not really) and finally get the wheels turning from the sales rep.\n\n$Fails responds like we woke him up from napping at his desk, shoves off some form about how we didn’t use the correct business name/was not signed by the proper point of contact.   \n\\*facepalm\\*  \nBro, you know who we are, you know what we want, make it so.  \n$Fails - Zo, sign thiszzz to make it officciiizzzzzallll (zzzzzzzz)\n\n\\*Play  elevator intermission music as many moons pass without any more status updates\\*\n\nCIO will not take blame for fudging up the whole project, he's somehow the hero.  \n~~Why do I smell pesto?~~  \n\n\nAn addendum from part 2, ITTC - You still have to pay us to move our pole out of the way for your new building.   \nFinance was not happy about that, we heard about his stern talking to by a finance auditor because of how long $VP waited to get the fiber moved off a pole that was holding up construction for a new building, it was weird event.  \nSidenote - $VP has been under scrutiny from audit teams due to some glaring lapses in judgement about how enterprises work.   \n\n\n$ITTS- Also, why aren't you paying us yet for these amazingly fast metro-e circuits?  \n$Me - Because they don't work!  \nWe tried to do the internet Metro-E cutover and it failed, found that the bandwidth was not adequate.  \nSite B needed 20mbps  \nSite A needed 200mbps  \nWe need more speed! \n\nITTC installed 20 at A and 200 at B without confirming with us the correct sites and order of bandwidth needed.   \nWe couldn't in good conscience hamstring a very active building on 20meg for 2 weeks and wait for the ISP to get their act together to flip the circuit speeds around. So we stepped back and continued onward with our old and measurably faster connection. \n\nSuddenly a wild email appears! \n\nIt caught us off-guard one day but it was not a surprise, our beloved $Fails was let go/fired/early retirement, my money is on fired because his replacement woke up this morning to tons of requests and confused clients wondering why their projects were not getting done.\n\nWe are testing this new rep to see if he'll do us any better, but so far, the outlook is dismal. \n\nSo, there you have it, I wish the end was a bit more thrilling, but many have chosen poorly in the running of the lines.   \nLastly, cutover part 4 may not happen, I am stepping down and changing companies to something a bit more sane, but still in IT.   \n\n\nAt this point the dust has settled, there's not much else that can go wrong (famous last words) because we know what to expect now with ITTC and how they work which is very slowly (if at all) and they really don't do what we ask without lots of waiting and encouragement on our part to get their act together.\n\nHowever, the president (of the company) and the board of directors are all involved now because of how bad ITTC is at doing their job.\n\nWe did a test with a much more reputable local ISP as part of moving phone lines around, one form later and a business day and the lines had been ported and forwarded to the new PRI. We are hoping to convince everyone that this ISP can cut the mustard compared to how badly ITTS cuts the cheese.   \n\n\nThank you all for the fun, but worry not, there will be more tales to come! ",

        "text": "I work tech support at a Real Estate Company and we provide email addresses for the Realtors with our company name on it. Last year we switched from a trashy pop mail server to gsuite. In the middle of that, we allowed Realtors to forward their email to a personal account if they set it up themselves. (see where this is going yet?) \n\nI get a call today from $NG (nice guy):\n$NG: Hi $me, I connected my $company email to my personal roadrunner email and I think I stopped getting the $company emails. \n\nI get a lot of people say they \"connected\" their emails together but they really mean they forwarded one to the other. So, I look-up his account and it says the last login was 12 months ago.. I'm thinking, surely this guy didn't just realize he's been without company emails for an entire year. I'm thinking maybe something happened and it stopped recently.\n\nI ask if I can login to his account and he says sure. So, I reset his password and login as him to check the settings.\n\nFirst thing I see? About 1800 unread emails dating back to August 2017.. The same time we switched to gsuite. \n\nI go into the forwarding and amazingly, it's set up correctly...\nBut it wasn't enabled.\n\nSo I enable it and that was it. \n\nI can't fully comprehend being without company emails for an entire year without noticing (we send out a not-so-subtle amount of emails/leads every day). I don't mind working with these Realtors because the majority of them are super nice and thankful but sometimes I wonder how they made it this far. \n",

It doesn't work on the second monitor\n\n&gt;$Me: Sure give me a minute to finish and I'll come to your desk.\n\nFast forward 10min. I go to $PS desk where he has his company issued laptop on the right, his personal laptop on the left and the provided Flatscreen in the middle. None of them connected to the screen or the keyboard and mouse also connected to the screen.\n\n&gt;$Me: So can you please show me what is your problem.\n\n&gt;$PS: When I connect this screen to the laptop my mouse doesn't work on it. Also this keyboard and mouse don't work.\n\n&gt;$Me: Ok, let's see.\n\nI plug in the screen, I plug in the USB cable going to the screen and everything seems to work just that the screen location was rotated. I go into display setting put the external monitor on the left side of the laptop and am done with it.\n\n&gt;$Me: Ok everything seems to be working fine, what exactly is the problem.\n\n&gt;$PS: Well the screen is connected, when I try to move the mouse(trackpad) it won't......moves trackpad.....ah it works now.\n\n&gt;$PS: Also this keyboard and mouse don't work...tryes tiping, moving the mose...oh they also work now.\n\n&gt;$Me: You forgot to connect the provided USB cable, it is ziptied to the display cable, you need both.\n\n&gt;$PS: Ah yes. Thank you $Me, everything works now!\n\nAfter solving what was basically screen placement and pluging a USB in I went back to my place.\n\nIt is sometimes quite surprising how some of these people managed to get this far in their careers.
