        "text": "The recent spate of satires focusing on the ultra-wealthy that go on to win major industry awards have me questioning just how much teeth these satires really have. This past year we saw Triangle of Sadness and The Menu, with the forming securing major awards wins culminating in an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. This turned my mind back to Parasite, which of course took the industry by storm. Another previous example would be Get Out. All of these movies were critically acclaimed and, except for The Menu, found major successful with the more Hollywood-elite dominate awards (e.g. the Globes, the Oscars).\n\nThis had me wondering, however, just how effective can the satire be if the people who the satire is directly criticizing fall in love with the movie. Triangle of Sadness is absolutely a skewering of the ultra-rich. And yet it burst onto the scene when it won best film at the world's most elite film festival, one where a bunch of extremely rich and famous people pack into a ten day long party on the French Riviera. It supposedly skewers the exact types of people who will pack into the Oscars in their designer gowns and expensive (rental) jewelry. Poorly paid servants will hand out gift bags worth tens of thousands of dollars to celebrities who will take their private cars to after parties where they will drink champagne worth more per bottle than their servers will make the entire night. And yet these same people will sit and cheer when a Triangle of Sadness clip is played just a few hours earlier.\n\nTo go in another direction, Parasite is a direct exploration of economic inequality. It is highly critical of its rich characters (not only them, of course). Those characters are, again, living lives with immense similarity to the rich and famous of Hollywood. Those same rich and famous who were targeted by Parasite stood and cheered as it won Best Picture. And all the coverage focused on the power of the movie, the meaning of a foreign film winning and...very little about the weird situation where the movie criticizing the elites was then embraced by the elites.\n\nSo all of this said, how successful can a satire really be if it not only appeals to its targets but becomes beloved by them? I expect some of this is that people see the systemic issue in the film but don't personally see themselves as the culprits. Some of that is human nature. But  is the satire really effective if it doesn't even make the people it goes after uncomfortable? If we look to the history of effective protesting one of the first things we notice is that it generally starts by making its targets angry and forcing their hand, not charming them by playing within the rules. These satire films, however, skip the first step and immediately appeal to their targets despite their satire. Is this toothless?\n\nThis isn't a criticism of these films but I think it's an awkward situation. Part of the problem in my mind is that these examples are all highly successful as pieces of entertainment (I didn't love them all but equally they were all well received). It is easy for anyone to watch them and enjoy themselves. That makes them extremely accessible for everyone and permits the viewer to, essentially, place the satire in the back seat. So someone can enjoy Parasite as incredible entertainment, appreciate it conceptually as satire but not actually engage with what the film is really saying. Or in the case of Triangle of Sadness the rich can actually identify with the portrayal of the fashion world and think \"not me\" on the worst parts of the rest (\"I am not an arms dealer!\").\n\nI think it is difficult for any film to change the minds of its targets. And I don't think a satire has to do so to be \"successful\". But I wonder if being extremely popular with, say, Oscar voters reveals that these films aren't as powerful satire as they might seem. Which is not to say they are not great films but just something I've been debating in my own mind in recent weeks. I'd appreciate the thoughts of others here on this as I'm having troubles reconciling it in my mind.",

        "text": "Her used to be my favourite film when I was younger. I loved Joaquins performance, as he had stripped all that \"movie star\" quality and just felt like a regular, lonely, hearbroken guy. Sometimes I think \"stars\" struggle to strip that x factor that makes them a star, but Joaquin does detailed and intimate work.   \n\n\nI also found the world building to be pretty impressive, I still feel like that world is real and in many ways wanted to be a part of it, despite the isolation that kind of looms over the film.  \n\n\nHowever, I rewatched it a few years later with some women friends of mine. And I was shocked about how much, in my opinion unnecessary, sexual stuff there was. There are lots of films that have sex scenes, and high sexual content that are necessary to the characters and the plot (Shame, even Wolf of Wall Street to really highlight the debauchery of it all) - for me it just seemed off in \"Her.\" There's a quality to it that feels like it doesn't NEED to be in the film. Like, for example, the pregnant woman, I 100% could've understood why he's thinking of her and not seen her boobs.   \n\n\nIt kind of put a bit of a taint on the film for me and I haven't gone back to watch it since.  \n\n\nWhat do you guys think about it?",

        "author": "elbasti",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10vljtd/help_me_find_the_source_of_this_insight_into/",
        "text": "*tldr:* I asked ChatGPT to help me compare _Inside Llewyin Davis_ and _A Serious Man_. It gave me some interesting but bland answers. Then I asked it to be original and it blew me away. I want to find the source of the deeper insight.\n\n***\nLong story: \n\nI asked chatGPT to compare those two movies. After a bit of prodding and refining, it gave me this answer, which I thought it was ok (The crazy stuff comes later):\n\n&gt; In \"A Serious Man\", the Coen brothers use minimalist visuals and a fragmented narrative to show Larry Gopnik's search for meaning. For instance, when Larry visits his Rabbi, he's told, \"It's not for us to understand, it's just for us to believe.\" This emphasizes the idea that life's biggest questions may be beyond comprehension. Chaos and uncertainty are conveyed through vignettes and fragmented narrative threads, such as the recurring mysterious figure in the park.\n\n&gt; In \"Inside Llewyn Davis\", melancholic visuals and a circular narrative reflect Llewyn Davis's search for meaning. For example, in a song, Llewyn sings, \"Oh, the days keep rollin' by, and the nights keep rollin' by,\" emphasizing the cyclical and repetitive nature of life. The film's cyclical narrative shows Llewyn repeating the same actions and experiences, unable to escape his circumstances or find purpose, such as his repeated trips to the gas station for his lost jacket.\n\n&gt; These quotes and specific details highlight the theme of searching for meaning and purpose, and show how the Coen brothers use style and form to explore these themes. Minimalist visuals in \"A Serious Man\" and melancholic visuals in \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" effectively show the characters' struggles to find meaning in life.\n\nI then gave it the following prompt:\n\n&gt; _You receive the following feedback about your answer: \"this answer is a bit shallow and relies on cliches and well-trod topics like 'the search for meaning'. However, the Cohen brothers are original thinkers. Please change the answer so that it's less cliched and provides novel insight. Keep the terse style and specific quotes and imagery\"_\n\nAnd chatGPT replied with this:\n\n&gt; Certainly, here's an updated answer that provides a novel insight into \"A Serious Man\" and \"Inside Llewyn Davis\":\n\n&gt; The Coen brothers often use Jewish culture as a lens to examine universal human experiences, and \"A Serious Man\" and \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" are no exception. In \"A Serious Man\", Larry Gopnik's search for meaning is depicted through the lens of the Jewish idea of \"loshon hara\" or evil speech. For example, in one scene, Larry's wife says, \"It's not just what you say, it's also how you say it.\" This highlights the idea that words have the power to harm or heal, and reflects the Jewish concept of \"loshon hara\". The film uses fragmented visuals and narrative to show the chaos that results from Larry's inability to control his words and thoughts.\n\n&gt; Similarly, in \"Inside Llewyn Davis\", the Coen brothers use the Jewish idea of \"tzadik\" or righteous person, to examine Llewyn's search for purpose. For example, in one scene, Llewyn sings the folk song \"The Death of Queen Jane\", which includes the lyrics, \"The queen is dead, long live the king.\" This line highlights the idea of the cyclical nature of life, and reflects the Jewish concept of the \"tzadik\" - a person who's always replaced by another. The film's circular narrative and melancholic visuals show Llewyn's inability to escape his circumstances and find a sense of purpose.\n\n&gt; These specific quotes and details provide a novel insight into the Coen brothers' use of Jewish culture to explore universal human experiences. By using Jewish ideas like \"loshon hara\" and \"tzadik\", the Coen brothers bring a unique perspective to the themes of the search for meaning and purpose in life.\n\nI thought this answer was _much_ more specific and insightful. The first answer sounds kinda bullshit-ey; the second one is _specific_. So then I started googling about \"Loshon hara\", and \"tzadik\" in the context of the Cohen brothers and found...nothing. Maybe my google-fu isn't that strong, but I'm having a hard time believing that chatGPT would draw those insights and connect hebrew words/concepts to _lyrics_ in _Inside Llewyin Davis_!\n\nThese generative models can, in some cases, output text/images that are borderline plagiarism, and the odds for that happening increase the more specific a prompt gets. I'm wondering if that's the case here.\n\nSo team, the question is: _*Have you ever encountered this specific insight about these two movies? If so, where_?*",

Megan was basically an innocent AI. All her observations were heavily monitored, like a child. Since one of Megan’s first interactions were about death at an early time, she had quickly learned the concept of death and the juxtaposition almost of it being more fragile to Human beings than AI’s. Shortly after, Megan had learned about violence, and getting attacked by a dog, all these learning mechanisms reciprocated into using it to protect Katie, the hunting on all fours, ripping body parts off, etc. \n\nMy point I guess is that if those events weren’t to happen in that specific order, Megan would’ve developed a much later incident or even stayed at the intelligence she had perceived outside of the human mind. Really interesting, hope they explore it more in a sequel hopefully",

He is introduced making a deal with a poor desperate soul (Butch), and he commands Vincent and Jules, his angels of death.\n\nVincent is tasked by Marsellus to take out Mia for the night. Almost at first sight, Vincent falls for Mia, as she falls for him. When we are introduced to Mia, Vincent is exploring her house seeming entirely lost, as a devil in Heaven probably would. Mia speaks to Vincent through the intercom, a disembodied voice from on High, spying on Vincent from above through a number of security cameras.\n\nLet's go.\n\nAt dinner Vincent and Mia are presented as opposites with black and white the whole time, down to their drinks. Mia is represented by the $5 shake. Expensive, luxurious, delicious, creamy, white, pure, with a cherry on top. Vincent is represented by his Coke. Harsh, acidic, black, cheap, but with a hint of vanilla, representing a hint of goodness deep in his heart. The dialogue in this scene is loaded. Vincent's steak is bloody as Hell. Mia orders her burger bloody too, a sign of her corruption. Vincent might have cooties, but Mia can handle them. Before we move on, quick note that Vincent drives a fiery/bloody red car. His Hellish steed.\n\nAfter Vincent and Mia dance and win the competition, Mia brings him back to Heaven. She is notably wearing Vincent's grey coat, shrouding her white shirt. Tarantino's music choices are pretty self-explanatory, but I need to point out the song here. 'Girl, you'll be a woman soon' refers to Mia's impending 'death' and fall from grace. There are also lyrics like 'he's not your kind', and 'the boy's no good.' 'Come take my hand' is sung when she's holding the bag of heroin that she of course finds in Vincent's coat pocket. The heroin symbolises the corruption that causes her to symbolically (and maybe clinically) die and fall from heaven when she ODs. That's what you get for dancing with the devil, I suppose.\n\nAnother juicy side note - Mia importantly mistakes the heroin for cocaine. She can't tell the difference between her white, heavenly vice, and the narcotic of choice for those who reside in hell. This is foreshadowed at the diner, when Mia can't tell the difference between Marilyn Monroe and Mamie Van Doren. Vincent points out the difference to her, because he knows what heroin looks like. I'm not sure how Mamie relates directly to heroin, but Marilyn symbolises cocaine. This is suggested by the shot of Marilyn's iconic pose where her skirt blows up in the wind, right before we cut to Mia snorting cocaine in the bathroom.\n\nSo what does Vincent do? He takes her to the one and only Lance. Our faithful neighbourhood drug dealer. Who but Lance, with his long hair, warm smile, and his signature robe and sandals, could perform this miracle of returning Mia back from the dead? You can see where I'm going with this. And how did Lance bring Mia back? With his trusty little black medical Bible-I mean notebook. Lance clearly represents Jesus who raises Mia from the dead.\n\nThere's something poetic about a corrupted avatar of the Messiah whose dealings with devils inadvertently lead to the death of an angel.\n\nLuckily he does manage to resurrect her, though he needs Vincent's help to find her heart. And of course Vincent knows where her heart is. Maybe not 'exactly', but close enough.\n\nAfter Mia comes back from the dead and Vincent takes her home, she has lost her white shirt, no grey cloak, just a black t shirt. Her grace has been stripped away and now she is a corrupted shadow of herself.\n\nAnother interesting tidbit regards Lance's wife, Jody, who has a devil tattoo on the left of her neck. It's obvious the first time we see her when Vincent is buying heroin.\n\nThis might be reaching a bit, but I don't think it's an accident that Jody specifically hands Lance the heroin that ends up causing Mia to OD. Seems like Jesus is being corrupted by her.\n\nThe next time we see Mia in Butch's story, she is dressed in black, with a blood red top underneath her black jacket. A wounded angel, fallen from Heaven to love a devil in Hell. \\*chef kiss\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nMia Wallace is an angel residing in heaven. (White shirt at restaurant, white house, does white cocaine)\n\nMarcellus Wallace is the devil residing in hell. (Red lighting in his lair, makes deals)\n\nVincent is an angel of death who falls in love with Mia and accidentally causes her to OD (die/fall from heaven)\n\nLance the drug dealer is Jesus the healer. (Raises Mia from the dead, little black medical book/Bible) Lance is married to Jody has a devil tattoo on her neck. While she doesn't work for Marcellus directly, she is associated with the drugs that kill our angel, Mia and cause her fall from grace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther symbolism/thoughts:\n\nMagic(!) Marker to bring back Mia\n\nThis analysis re-contextualises Jules' sermon\n\nLance is shot during his introductory scene with low angles, elevating him and suggesting a reverent quality\n\nMia's black hair represents imperfection?\n\nLance(!) Of Longinus = the adrenaline shot?\n\n'Coke is dead as dead. Heroin is coming back in a big way' (death and resurrection of Mia)",

However, something that confuses me is how commonly is the character of Colm viewed as the embodiment of intelligence and artistry.\n\nColm is a pseud.\n\nNow within the context of a small provincial town in the 20s of course Colm looks like a thinking man, and he definitely possesses some measure of talent and intelligence, but the level to with which he holds himself is simply absurd.\n\nThis is a clearer than ever in the scene where Padraic drunkenly confronts him. First, Colm compares himself to Mozart and Beethoven, which is laughably absurd coming from someone who still plays the fiddle in rinky dinky pubs with his mates when he's nearly 70. Second, he confuses Mozart, an iconic figure of late 18th century with the 17th century, going to show how little he knows. And third and most important of all is how he is literally asking who is famous for being nice while a picture of Jesus hangs up right in front of him.\n\nHowever, the most telling sign is his brutal subconscious self-sabotage. The man literally wrecks his hand, his ability to perform the music he supposedly so craves to perform, for no other reason that some guy is vaguely annoying him. \n\nIt's no wonder why by the end of the film he is so warm towards the man who has sworn eternal rivalry to him. He has completely pinned down his failure to be a great artist to the town's fool. He doesn't have to suffer from guilt or fear or depression anymore.\n\nHe's finally free.",

        "text": "I do wanna make a mention to just one cause I quite love these movies.\n\nThere is the animated short film \"Pussy\" by Renata Gąsiorowska, which is about a chick who plays around with her... pussy and then becomes alive. It's very funny and silly but also, it is weirdly relatable in how it presents just trying to pleasure yourself when you are by yourself and don't have much stuff to do on a free day despite not being a woman with a vagina. I also think the animation is quite adorable and the female protagonist taking a shower is actually my background image. It's kinda iconic imo. \n\nI also really love \"Hair Love\" but I probably wouldn't appreciate it nearly as much if it wasn't for my own personal experiences with my own hair. My mom really doesn't like looking at my hair grow big, which is why she would always force me to cut and would hurt afterwards. As I found out that I am trans, I refused to go to the barber and allowed it to grow into an afro and it is what I consider to be the part of my proud I am most proud about. But because I kept it that way, my mom would keep insulting my hair and telling me that I should change it, which really put a lot of stress on me and make me feel depressed cause I am happy about having my hair. It is a part of me just like how me being trans is a part of me and me being Puerto Rican and half-Black is a part of me. And I don't want to take those things away from me. The movie is there to tell me that I should love my hair and I shouldn't try to hide it. And that's the kind of message I live by. Fortunately, I haven't had much problem with others about my hair, not even at work. People often compliment me about it, which makes me feel very happy. It is quite possibly one of the most personal movies in my list of favorite films in general. It's beautifully animated, has a beautiful message and it's a nice glimpse into the life of a black family.\n\n\"Night &amp; Fog\" by French director, Alain Resnais, which features the abandoned concentration camps created by Nazi Germany and describes the horrors of them ten years after their liberation. It's a very close and personal exploration about one of the worst crimes ever committed by humanity and it is very beautifully presented its heavy subjects matter.",

Nicholas Hope acts General Sir Walter Braithwaite (WB), and James Callis acts Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett (EAB).\n\nWB — We spoke in June, Bartlett. Do you recall?\n\nEAB — Of course.\n\nWB — And do you remember the subject matter of our discussion?\n\nEAB — Hm?\n\nWB — You gave an assurance not to criticise GHQ or its officers or the conduct of the campaign.\n\nEAB — As far as I know, I've kept to this.\n\nWB  — Hmm. On September the 8th, you sent a letter, via Mr Murdoch, to Mr Asquith. An uncensored letter.\n\nEAB — Indeed I did. I have a perfect right to address my Prime Minister. How did you find out about it?\n\nWB  — That letter has been seized by us.\n\nEAB — Has it? And has it been forwarded to the proper address?\n\nWB  — I warned you I would send anyone away who spoke against the campaign.\n\nEAB — Well, then you must send away practically everyone on the peninsula, including the Turks.\n\nWB  — Your press credentials are hereby revoked. You are no longer the guest of the Army. You are to return home.\n\nEAB —  Ah. And may I leave at once? \n\nWB  —  What?\n\nEAB —  Thank you so much, Walter. I've been anxious to get back for some time. I'll certainly have a lot to say in London.\n\nWB  —  Oh, um...\n\nEAB —  Mediterranean leishmaniasis.\n\nWB  —  I beg your pardon?\n\n**EAB — It's a parasite. It will finally kill its host and therefore dies as well. I suggest you look it up.**\n\n### https://movies.stackexchange.com/q/119506",

        "text": "The joint family- the backbone of the Indian populace. A single location, often old and cramped- where multiple generations of a family live alongside each other and lead a distinctly dysfunctional yet fiercely united existence. A stubborn and deliberate affront to the increasingly fragmented and globalized world we find ourselves in. These are the people Archana Phadke brings alive through her lens, without judgement, unfiltered, uninhibited, unbothered, brave and fearless.\n\nAnd yet, try as hard as I may, I cannot muster an ounce of objectivity towards any of these people and anything they say or do. I soon realised why- it's because Archana wasn't just documenting her life, she was documenting mine as well. I may be seeing all these people for the first time but I recognise every single one of them-\n- The Men: Stubborn, thickheaded, irritable, entitled and yet stoic, brave, unconditionally caring and always dependable.\n- The women: Quite and resolute. People who married too early and somewhere left their ambitions behind to take care of the family. To them, freedom is a luxury and solace a commodity. They are the backbone of this commune.\n- The children: (Me) Unaware of how privileged their lives have been and the sacrifices that have gone into keeping it that way. Standing on the shoulders of those who came before them all the while looking down on them. And yet, wouldn't know what to do if they didn't exist. The love is unstated, but it is there and it is there in droves.\n\nA perfect snapshot of existence in a third world metropolis, About Love violently jerked me back to the place I call home, a place I often think back to as a beautiful dream, and one that will never happen again- those gorgeous duplex buildings with paint chipping off, the bustle of traffic beneath you and the birds chirping all day above you, the unreliable electricity and the maids who have been there longer than you and know the family better than they know themselves; the inevitable circuit malfunctions, the whisliting cookers and the pots and pans clanking, feet shuffling, all furiously preparing for the next phase of the day; the obligatory Dan Brown and Baldacci novels from when dad was in his reading phase; the elders and their various medications, their propping illnesses and a slow melancholy that disturbs this small paradise when occasionally confronted with it's own mortality, only to be diffused by the struggles of everyday life, of businesses that need to be run and of mouths that need to be fed and finally at the end of the evening- the rumble of three generations snoring blissfully into the night, at once- ready to fight, bicker, work, love and sacrifice for each other all over again.\nThis is the world I come from and these are my people. And that is my whole heart up in that screen.\n\nI cannot fully process what has happened to me in these 91 minutes. I smiled, almost cried, laughed, sympathized and fell in love with my home all over again. This is a doc I will never forget and thoroughly recommend each and every one watches. If only to have a glance at the world you are in, or the world you have left behind.",

According to Downy Sr, Johnson kept flubbing his lines and so the director dubbed the performance himself.\n\nWhich means that Downy Jr's performance of a white man pretending to be a black man for a film is inspired by his own father ACTUALLY pretending to be a black man for a film.\n\nI always saw Downy Jr as satirising tone-deaf actors who think they can play any role.

Based on An Agatha Christie Story. Laughton really portrays a stubborn ass in the film, and I love him for that and I think it is his best performance. His banter with Lancaaster is also good.\n\nThere is also 12 Angry Men, Judgement At Nuremberg, Anatomy Of A Murder, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Verdict, A Few Good Men, My Cousin Vinny that are also great. Even Passion Of Joan Of Arc is also a courtroom drama, a very biased one, but a courtroom drama.\n\nWhat do you think is the Best Courtroom Drama?\n\nHow come they don't make them like they use to?",

And perhaps very simple changes to the script or direction or even a casting of a different male lead may have made a large difference.\n\nBut what truly caught my attention was a scene closer to the end. Our failed writer protagonist has a woman mock him by reading a review of his novel. In close proximity it goes something like, \"(the author) doesn't really have anything to say and tries to cover up this fact with pretentious details.\"\n\nWhat's so interesting about that as a line in the film: is this is the exact type of criticism one could levy at Infinity Pool itself. If it did have anything to say it gets bogged down in weird images which are clearly meant to suggest depth but fall short. \n\nSo what is curious to me is having a writer understand a criticism and yet commit the same crime suggested by that criticism. Is this a type of partial self awareness? Or a hyper self awareness which still falls flat?\n\nIt was an odd moment.",

And Scott Aukerman mentioned it on a recent podcast and how much he loves it and I tend to always agree with his movie taste. \n\nI FINALLY watched it this weekend and... I don't want to be that guy but I'm clearly missing something. Why is 'Slacker' so beloved? It's just 90 minutes of insufferable men talking conspiracy theories and talking at women and making them uncomfortable. Its Twitter in real life. I can't tell if that's the point or if Linklater was just that insufferable guy in the 90's? But I love Dazed and Confused, I loved the Before Trilogy and I love A Scanner Darkly. But I can't think of a less enjoyable time I've had watching a movie than I did with 'Slacker'. Abrasive and awkward. Would never have thought it was the same director. Is it maybe just nostalgia for that time period and for 90's indie film? But I ask myself that and think well I still love Clerks, El Mariachi, Reservoir Dogs and so many of that period of 90's indie film debuts.\n\nI think why it's riled me up so much too is it isn't just people saying \"I loved that movie... when it came out.\" No. Everyone I know has re-watched it recently and STILL stands by it. This I just don't understand. There have been movies when I was younger I SWORE by and have since revisited and I hated them. Garden State is the perfect example. And the way I felt watching Slacker for the first time this weekend was how I felt revisiting Garden State a decade later. UNCOMFORTABLE.\n\nIs there a story BEHIND Slacker that maybe is more interesting than the film?",

The Redux cut was my first viewing of Apocalypse Now so I have some bias in favor of that cut, but I will try to detach from that in my brief analysis.\n\nFrom a film criticism standpoint, I can agree with most when it is asserted that the theatrical version is the best. It is short enough to not bore audiences, and it is concise enough to get the point of anti-colonialism, the insanity of war, and the horror of human atrocity across without ever losing proper pacing. It is a fantastic and sometimes horrifying trip upriver that never loses its suspense for the whole runtime. \"Never get off the boat,\" as they say. It is entirely understandable that the Redux cut ruins this with its pacing.\n\nHowever, I cannot help but appreciate the value of the added scenes in the Redux cut (the Final Cut also has some of these scenes added, but it acts more as a middle ground between the Redux and theatrical versions, and as such I will only be referring to the Redux cut). The four most notable additions off the top of my head are the added scenes for Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore, the added Playboy Bunnies scene, the French plantation scene, and an added Colonel Kurtz scene.\n\nWhat makes these scenes so important to the film, in my opinion, is that they add to the themes of the film in an almost vital way that left me somewhat disappointed after seeing their absence in the theatrical version. In regards to some of the lighter additions, like the Kilgore scenes, we get to really delve into the insanity and wastefulness of Kilgore and the whole war, and we also get one of the best characterizing quotes from Captain Willard. When he responds to Chief Phillips', \"Do you like it like that, Captain, when it's hot, hairy,\" Willard responds with, \"Fuck. Never get a chance to know what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.\" We get more answers as to why Willard is the way he is and why he craves going back into the jungle even though he is being asked to do a morally questionable thing like killing one of the Army's own Colonels. While it may ruin the mysteriousness of a cold-hearted assassin, it makes his character more understandable.\n\nWhile I enjoy these smaller additions, it is the Playboy Bunny scene and the French plantation scene that pack the most punch thematically out of all the additions in the Redux Cut. Horror is one of the film's key themes, and as is with most wars in all of human history, you rarely find violent horror and murder without rape and sexual horror. To be heard but not listened to, to be pimped out in exchange for resources, and to not be seen as free individuals is the weight that the exploitation of the Bunnies brings to the table when it comes to sexual horror and horror in general.\n\nAs for the French plantation scene, I agree with Francis Ford Coppola's original intentions in regard to using the boat as a metaphor for a time machine. Going from the beginning, to the sequences with Kilgore, to the Do Lung bridge, and finally to the primitive warrior people on Kurtz's compound shows how the further they go upriver, the more violent, insane, and primitive people become. The fifties-esque colonialist French on the plantation truly add to this sequence, and not having that scene in the film almost feels like the anti-colonialist message of the film is weakened.\n\nWhile I will always recommend the theatrical version and assert it as the best critically, I stand firmly in maintaining the Redux cut as my favorite, and will probably give it the most rewatches out of all of them.\n\nWhat does r/TrueFilm think?",

        "text": "I think Eraserhead is definitely about the fears and anxieties of fatherhood and being an adult but I think there is also another level that explains some of the other details in the film. My theory is that Henry is a factory or a machine for reproduction. The world of eraserhead is surrounded with factories and machines and Henry is just another of these to otherworldy beings that control us. The being that controls Henry is the Man in the Planet. It is his job to make sure that Henry reproduces and creates offspring. \"The Planet\" is either a symbolic interpretation of Henry's mind or an actual celestial planet but either way The man inside is tasked with pulling the levers that conceive the baby and we see this conception in the first scene as the sperm creature drops into the puddle.\n\nThe man in the planet is similar to the black lodge inhabitants in Twin Peaks or the Rabbits in Inland Empire. They could be mental creations to cope with powerful emotions as well as the mysteries of life or they could also be real creatures out there somewhere that have control over us. Eraserhead explores the entities that influence reproduction and childbirth in the world. These entities view people has machines that simply are meant to produce offspring. David Lynch seemed to have some kind of resentment towards this aspect of life and wanted to get his feelings out creatively on film.\n\nAnyway because of this man and whatever force he is serving, Henry is forced to live a depressing life with a child and wife he doesn't want. In this miserable existence Henry dreams up the lady in the radiator. She is kind of a rebel to the system encouraging Henry to go against these forces by killing his baby and plants the idea that outside this world of factories and machines there is a Heaven where everything is fine. The whole dream sequence of Henry's head being used as an eraser reflect this concept that humans are just tools, but in this dream Henry makes the decision to be a tool to erase or destroy rather than to create. Killing his baby also kills the man in the radiator and provides some kind of catharsis and freedom from the system to Henry.",

So do I rate it high because of the new things it tried or do I rate it low because I didn't like it?\n\nThen there is Barry Lyndon (1975), I loved its beauty, melancholy, pacing, and characters, but are these reasons enough for me to rate it high? I can't pinpoint what's so great or what was the film about except for some vague idea about the themes it tackled.\n\nIkiru (1952) was a good movie, it made me wonder about life and happiness and fulfillment among other themes but again it got a little boring sometimes, but again I get hesitated to say it to people because of how great it's considered.\n\nA big part of why I love Kubrick, Scorsese, Tarantino, Wes Anderson, and Wong Kar-Wai is their stylistic choices, making me want to watch the films again and again. Obviously, there is a lot more to their films than the style, aesthetics, and moods. The editing, framing, and music choices are amazing in their films.\n\nOn the same note, Ingmar Bergman's films, also have great characters and dialogues but because they are not as romanticized and stylized as the ones I mentioned before, they are not as entertaining in the basic sense as the others. Persona (1966) was a good watch but I don't want to watch it again, I don't understand what makes it one of the greatest, I mean the characters were cool and the dynamics and I loved the framing and editing but It was a solid 4/5, I don't know how it's one of the greatest.\n\nValerie and her week of wonders (1970) was very memorable, it was beautiful visually and the score was also beautiful but I didn't completely understand the story or philosophy, how do I understand these better?\n\nFeel free to share your opinion about where you think I'm wrong about how I perceive cinema and what should I do regarding that, also please share your thoughts about cinema in general.",

        "text": "This is one of those films that you either love or hate. I can say that I absolutely loved it! It reminded me a lot of Portrait of a Lady on Fire, which I also loved. From a technical point this film is a masterpiece. Everything is crafted into perfection. The reason why people either love or hate The Piano, is most likely because of the plot.\n\nThere are specific sexual manipulative plot points during this film, which are understandably not for everyone. During my viewing of the film I wasn't sure how to feel about these scenes. I was more worried about where the story and plot would go than I was curious about where they would go. Luckily the story and plot went into a direction that kept me interested and I started to look at the sexual manipulation from a different perspective.\n\nOn the surface the relationship between Ada and Baines seems like it is solely based on manipulation and rape. But if you look below the surface you will see that the core of their relationship is based on desire. A desire to love and to be loved.\n\nThe main theme of this film is desire. Ada's desire to play the piano was the foundation for her desire to be desired. She became aware of this once Baines stopped seducing her. We see that the piano is not only a key element in Ada's life, it is also a key element of the love story between her and Baines. This means that the piano is an element that creates desire.\n\nThe piano is also an element that provides a way to express emotions. These emotions are felt through the music that is played on the piano, but also through the body language of Ada while she is playing the piano. Even though Ada is mute, which means she is not able to speak, her body language and facial expressions tell us everything we need to feel.\n\nThis would not be possible if Holly Hunter didn't give a performance of a lifetime. Her performance was one of the best I've ever seen and it will be hard to find a performance that will be better. You could feel the emotions just by looking into her eyes. This alone is worth mentioning. All the other actors and actresses also gave an amazing performance, which had me fully immersed into the film.\n\nAnother aspect that had me fully immersed was the beautiful cinematography. From the first shot I immediately knew that the cinematography was going to be great. The compositions were gorgeous and visually enhanced the emotions of Ada, especially when she played the piano. This was not only done with a close-up of her face, that transported her emotions through her eyes to the viewer, but it was also done by framing her and the piano in a very specific way. Like I mentioned in other reviews, the Rule of Thirds composition with the visual element at the bottom, is my favorite composition. A composition that was beautifully used throughout this film.\n\nWith a film named The Piano you would expect the score to be nothing but perfect... which it absolutely was. Both the music played on the piano by Holly Hunter, and the score composed by Michael Nyman, were beautiful and immediately became one of my favorite film scores of all-time.\n\nOverall this film was amazing. It had me interested throughout the entire runtime due to its strong beginning, ending... and everything inbetween.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10uiyfx/les_blanks_documentaries_about_lightening_hopkins/",
        "text": "This article contains a lot of film stills. For a fully illustrated version please click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/les-blanks-documentaries-about-lightening-hopkins-clifton-chenier-and-mance-lipsomb/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/les-blanks-documentaries-about-lightening-hopkins-clifton-chenier-and-mance-lipsomb/)\n\nAll documentaries are doomed to fail. For the most part documentary films are trying to capture something that can not be captured. Whether it is something abstract like the human experience, or more specific like an event or an individual, no documentary can capture a full representation of whatever it is documenting. \n\nThis failure is partly due to the limits of film as a medium, but the heart of the problem is in the plural nature of perception and reality. No single point of view can represent the entirety of reality, or the entirety of a person or event.\n\nThe history of documentary production is a history of documentarians struggling with these issues. They court an objective and gestalt perception by minimizing their presence and maximizing the presence of their subject’s.\n\nYou can see this struggle in Les Blank’s three music documentaries *The Blues Accordin’ to Lightnin’ Hopkins* (1968), *A Well Spent Life* (1972), and *Hot Pepper* (1973). Blank does what he can to keep himself out of it. There is no narration. There are no linkages that string scenes together into some larger meaning. There is very little except the subject and his friends presenting themselves to the camera. \n\nBlank makes no claim to pure objectivity but you can see that he is trying to let the subjects speak for themselves. His efforts produce something compelling that indeed does feel “authentic” and “whole.” It is however important to recognize that Blank is the one choosing what to shoot and when to shoot it. He is the one asking the prompts, and editing the answers. His hand may not be seen in the documentary but it is none the less present. \n\nBlank was one of several men who went down south to find “authentic” blues and folk music. Alan Lomax and his son John Lomax led the way. They had communist leanings and spent their lives seeking out “the music of the people” all over the world. Blank knew the Lomaxes and was influenced by their work. Like the Lomaxes, Blank would just drive out into rural areas of Mississippi, Louisiana or Texas and ask around to find who in the area was playing music at the local fish fries and juke joints. That’s how Alan Lomax found Muddy Waters. When Lomax found his way to Muddy Water’s farm Lomax found Muddy burning his still. Muddy had heard that there was a white man looking for him and figured it had to be the revenue men.\n\nThe racial politics of Blank, Lomax and the others is complex. It would be far too reductive to describe them as racist but there were difficult issues that posed problems. When Lomax discovered Huddle Leadbedder, also known as Leadbelly, Lomax wanted to send Leadbelly out on a tour of the United States. Lomax planned to dress Leadbelly in overalls, a bandana, and a straw hat as if he were a field hand. However Leadbelly wanted to wear a suit. Lomax wanted to present audiences with a bonafide piece of southern American history and Leadbelly wanted to be a charismatic, successful musician.\n\nThese are the sort of difficulties Blank hoped to avoid in his films. All three of the musician films allow the musician to present himself on his own terms. Although it is hard to truly parse out. Blank came to Lightnin’s world and filmed Lightnin’ in his element. Lightnin’ was drunk, but it would have been hard to find him in any other state. He was dressed sloppily and wearing his trademark dark sunglasses and sometimes a straw hat. Intentional or not Lightnin’ fulfilled the stereotype. More than Chenier or Lipsomb, Lightnin’ was a showman. He was always bragging, always on. \n\nBlank could have sought out Lightenin’ at a club and caught him looking more “polished.” Conversely Blank could have tried to break through Lightenin’s facade to seek out something more genuine and intimate. Lightenin’, like all of us, is a moving target that changes his performed identity depending on the context. \n\nCompared to Lightnin’, Mance Lipsomb was a far more soft spoken and modest man. Lipsomb was a different kind of entertainer. He mostly sang the popular blues songs of his day, whereas Lightnin’ wrote most of his songs. They both helped to pioneer a unique style of guitar picking that differs from the rhythmic thumping of the Mississippi style, but you don’t learn any of that from one of Les Blank’s films. Instead of braking down these musician’s contributions to their style, Blank chooses to show us the cows chewing their cud, the kids playing in the field and the chickens pecking around for bugs. Differences in picking technique is too abstract, too rarefied for the atmosphere. It’s not direct enough for what Blank is cultivating. Blank is looking for a straight forward portrait of a man without the interference of an ethnomusicologist\n\nThe Clifton Chenier documentary is made the same way as the others. The camera simply follows Chenier from the farm to the barber shop, and then to the bar where he plays. There is no information presented, nothing is quantified or analyzed. There is Mr. Chenier and his cohort talking about life, love and music and joking about getting old. By the end you feel as though you have spent the day with a warm and talented musician. It feels personal.  \n\nIt seems likely that Chenier would approve of the final product that Blank made, but Chenier might wonder why it wasn’t more polished. Chenier often wore a crown on stage because he had crowned himself the king of Zydeco. Blank’s film does contain a small amount of footage of Chenier wearing the crown on stage. Such bravado begs the question of what a documentary authored by Chenier himself would look like. Blank was not there to play into Chenier’s vision of who Chenier was. Blank was hoping to capture the feeling and atmosphere that helped create Chenier.  I have to acknowledge my own biases in writing this piece. As I write these words there is a picture of Lightnin’ Hopkins hanging over the doorway to my living-room. As a guitar player myself and blues enthusiast I am an avid admirer of Lightnin’s music. With the “me too moment” fueling a new examination of art and artists, a man like Lightnin’ would pose challenges for some people. As I said I admire his music, but it would not be easy to separate the man from his art. His songs are essentially about the difficulties of his life. The songs themselves are a coping mechanism for him. He has spoken specifically about the blues as a means to sooth his pain. I admire his connection to his work and the way it functions in his life. I admire his ability to bring it to others and help forge a community around basic human experiences. From what I understand he was an alcoholic, and if his songs are an indication of how he treated women I certainly don’t admire his ideas surrounding love and gender.\n\nI have plenty of Lightning Hopkins cds, and I have carefully gone through several of his songs in an attempt to learn them note by note, but putting his picture on my living room wall seems like a different kind of admiration. It has more to do with admiring him as a person than just a musician. It’s hard to separate the two.\n\nI have a picture of Tom Waits on my desk at work. I’ve never met him or Lightnin’ Waits is a showman just like Hopkins. Waits has created several different personae that he presents to the world. Is the picture on my desk a portrait of Waits, or a portrait of the image he has crafted? The difference between Waits and Hopkins is that Waits has more control over how he is seen. Even with Blank coming to Hopkin’s home, the image that Blank captures, edits and constructs is out of Hopkins’ hands. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Blank’s film works to lessen Blank’s presence but it isn’t necessary to eliminate it. Blank has a contribution to make. He is using his craft to create a portrait. A portrait that may reveal something about his subjects that others might not immediately see.\n\n*The Blues According to Lighten’ Hopkins* is a film by Blank about Hopkins, but the problem arrises when publications like *The Daily* write an article that begins “Les Blank, the poetic documentary filmmaker who gave voice to the obscure and gap-toothed, died Sunday at his home in the Berkeley hills.” To be fair “The Gap Toothed” comment refers to a movie Blank made about gapped toothed women, but still the quote positions Blank as a bit of a messiah, or at least a benevolent white man granting favor to the helpless. I don’t think he saw himself that way but his work exists in a context that cannot be avoided.  \n\nBlank was a highly educated white man venturing down south to find black musicians he could capture in film portraits. I am glad he did. The portraits he rendered are rich and beautiful. His films display a genuine effort to fully respect and render his subjects.\n\nIn *A Well Spent Life* there is considerably more talking than in the other two films. Mance Lipscomb tells stories and philosophizes about life and particularly about married life. When he sits down at the table to have dinner his wife sits down on the couch. Lipsomb is trying to show how wise he is as a husband but his wife explains that Mance came home so late one night that his dinner had gotten cold. She had dinner waiting on the table, but he didn’t get home in time so she swore that night that she would never serve dinner at the table again. Since then she cooks the meals but it’s up to him to serve himself.\n\nIt was Blanks choice to include this story which unravels a little of the story Lipscomb is weaving. Blank allows the possibility of Lipsomb being an unreliable narrator which brings a deeper dimension to the entire presentation. We end up with competing narratives.\n\nIt all speaks to the connection between identity and narrative. A large part of our identities is formed by a group of stories we tell ourselves, and others, about our lives. Relationships are essentially collaborative narratives. Whether it is a romantic “meet cute” or the recounting of a fight, all relationships are a constant negotiation between differing points of view. Making documentaries involves the same negotiation. The director, the subject and anyone else involved are engaged in constructing meaning through the assembly of events into a story. Each version of that story has to contend with the other competing versions. When it comes to Lipscomb and his wife the two versions of their marriage sit side by side in the film. Blank offers no ultimate reconciliation, he just presents what is said. However the movie is ultimately about Mance Lipsomb and just by virtue of his face being on the poster we are pre-disposed to lend his words more import. \n\nWhether it is a documentary film or real-life experiences we are eternally embroiled in a never ending tangle of singular points of view that we are obliged to reconcile. This is the only way we know how create meaning. Blanks films present spontaneous interactions between him and these three men. They are unscripted but planned. They are free floating exchanges but they are edited. They are focused closely on each man, but stay general in an effort to include context. These contradictions are not problems as much as they are issues that create intriguing tension. \n\nThe three films make an effort to present their subjects at face value. They make an effort to reserve judgment and minimize analysis. It appears that Blank wants his audiences to think of his films in a similar fashion. We are meant to take the footage at face value, as simply a document of what he saw, but as simple as it may appear, exchanges between individuals, either on film or off, are never that simple.",

I don't know if any of y'all felt this way but this was the most boring dialogue I've ever heard. \n\nEvery scene the dialogue felt like in this weird in-between place where it's not naturalistic or witty, it doesn't seem to be going for a surreal, lynchian tone, and it has incredibly shallow subtext. Maybe the shallowness of it wouldn't be so bad if the scenes weren't dragged out so long that I felt like they were saying the same thing over and over and I understood what they were trying to say or imply in the scene within the first 30 seconds and I've mentally checked out by the end.\n\nAnd while the cinematography was pretty good, I felt like it was nowhere near interesting enough to carry these scenes and hold my interest, and frankly the same goes for the acting. I've scene a lot of people praise Florence Pugh and she's like, just fine??? Like not bad by any means, but she really didn't stand out to me at all, just a good, competent performance, which i felt went for most of the cast. \n\nMaybe it was the dialogue or the directing (probably a bit of both) but for the majority of the movie the interactions between characters feels stale and uninteresting, which maybe could have been to show the superficiality of the vr world except it felt the exact same in the real world! \n\nMaybe I'm being too harsh, I should emphasize that I didn't think this movie was awful, even the dialogue isn't horrific, it just all comes together feeling mediocre. The best parts aren't good enough to elevate the rest of the movie, and the bad parts don't even have the decency of being entertainingly so.",

The story is based on a play about the Scopes Monkey Trials. \n\nI love this movie and Spencer Tracy is fantastic as Henry Drummond in this movie and I really love Fredric March in this film. \n\nFredric March portrays Matthew Harrison Brady and really elevates Brady in what could of easily been played as a Buffoon, instead March portrays Brady as a man who embodied the religious cause so thoroughly that he abandons his reason and perspective. He descends to the level of a fanatic, and it’s literally what destroys him in the end. \n\nOn the Other end is E.K Hornbeck portrayed by Gene Kelly, the openly cynical jokester who mocks everyone who is in his presence. He hates Brady and doesn't believe in his views and tires everything in his might to mock Brady. However I think Brady and Hornbeck are two sides of the same coin. However when confronted with his flaws, he turns away from these criticisms. Drummond reduces him down to what he really is: a self-loathing, lonely man who has no real attachments or dreams, and the only way for him to hold the depression at bay is to laugh.\n\nNow we come to Henry Drummond, who is trying to make sense of the situation. Drummond really doesn't care what anyone thinks and is just determine to keep his Client out of Jail. He understands the stupidity of the situation and doesn't think what the town is doing is fair. However, he also understands that everyone is entitled to their beliefs and that Religion Theory and Evolution Theory are basically the same thing. Especially at the end, weighing both the Bible and Darwin's Evolution; then slamming them together. These two seemingly differing points of views may in reality be the same, just told differently. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on Inherit The Wind?",

        "text": "I was knocked over by how great this film is. A lot of WW II movies (and war movies in general) tend to portray war as an adventure, and if there are sacrifices, they tend to be about a solider sacrificing himself for others on the battlefield.\n\nWhat really moved me about this film how the three solders (portrayed by Frederic March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell) care deeply about each other, but also must each overcome their own personal and psychological struggles to readjust to postwar society. They wanted to return home as soon as possible, but once they arrive, they aren't sure what to do next. But they know brotherhood and that, ultimately, is what allows them to prevail.\n\nI can sometimes be a film snob if a movie wins Best Picture, leading me to approach it with an attitude of \"Oh, yeah? Prove it.\" But this movie deserves its praise and I'd argue ought to receive more recognition by modern audiences as a timeless classic. Some people won't even watch B&amp;W movies and that disappoints me. There are big emotional ideas in this movie that I found very universal, even though I never served in the military.\n\nBy the way, as a big fan of \"Inherit the Wind,\" starring Spencer Tracy and Frederic March, I have new appreciation for what a wonderful actor the latter is. He plays a completely different type of character in that movie and \"The Best years of Our Lives\" (flamboyant vs. reticent) and I'm now eager to explore more of his roles.",

        "text": "I've been feeling like a wannabe film professor lately, and in that spirit, I thought about what my film syllabus would look like. What movies would I show to my students (or at least certain scenes from them? How do you pick certain movies over others? And how do you know you've covered enough of film history to say that you're an expert on the subject matter? I've always said, the only way to be able to speak on film without any blind spots, is to simply watch every movie ever made. In other words, only Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino can speak on it.\n\nStill, it's a fun challenge, and makes you see what it is you value in film. After giving it some thought, I decided that what matters most to me is technique, that is to say, camerawork, editing, sound, and all other craft categories, the building blocks that make film a unique art. So, that became my criterion: the movie has to have been some sort of advancement in cinematic technique, and because of the highly technical nature of the process, many of these also end up being advancements in technology. With that in mind, I made a list and asked for suggestions some months back. With those suggestions and some other new additions, I decided on the following 50 movies as my personal \"canon\" or \"syllabus\", ordered in a way as to chart an evolutionary path on the formal craft and function of filmmaking. [Here's the list.](https://letterboxd.com/grandkeizer/list/the-evolution-of-film-technique-and-technology/) You can check the notes for my reasoning on each one. You have the early experiments (Sallie Gardner and Arrival of a Train), then the basic building blocks (Suspense, A Trip to the Moon), more advancements in set (Caligari) camerawork (Last Laugh) editing (Potemkin) and effects (Metropolis), breaking through to the early building blocks of sound (Blackmail, Applause, Le Million, M), which were consolidated in Sign of the Cross, and on and on to the modern day of HD video and CGI worlds with Attack of the Clones and Avatar, along with the ultra lo-fi anxiety of modern technology with Searching and Skinamarink. \n\nI have to emphasize once again that this is about the craft behind the movie, not it's innate quality, although many films here I'd comfortably rank among the best ever. It's also not meant to represent every single film movement or style. We have German Expressionism, Italian Neorealism, French New Wave, and Dogme 95, but their inclusion was based purely on their advancement of technique. Some incredible and influential films like Psycho, Some Like it Hot, Pulp Fiction, and many others are absent from this list, because while quite influential, the advancements were in narrative, not in craft. On that topic, some movies like Vertigo and the early users of Steadicam aren't here because while they represented some small, incremental advancements, they were beaten out by other films that changed more.\n\nUltimately, I capped the list at 50 movies so that it can be somewhat digestible, compared to something like the 1000 movies to see before you die list, or even the various top 250 movies lists. I'm sure I missed something, and some choices may be controversial, but that's why I'm posting it: to generate discussion, see if I missed anything, and if any movie on here needs to be replaced. Just be nice. Please.",

        "text": "(NOTE: This post makes blatant assumptions about certain political groups)\n\nSo in the realm of Drama films we sometimes see works that are labeled as “slow cinema”. Often these films will have a strongly intended sociopolitical message. Examples include:\n\nJeanne Dielman (feminism)\nWendy and Lucy (poverty in America)\nIn Vanda’s Room (drug addiction)\nEtc…\n\nThe problem with these films is not in their craft or message, but in who they will likely appeal to. Slow Cinema tends to be art films. And “art films” most often appeal to leftist or liberal people. And “art films” are almost always made by leftist or liberal people.\n\nSo we have films made by leftists, for leftists. If the intent is to change the perspective of the viewer on a certain issue or topic, Slow Cinema might do a poor job of that.\n\nTake Dirty Harry or Death Wish for examples. They have been lambasted by critics as “fascist works of art”. Whether you agree or not, a key element of them is that they are extremely entertaining. And on the societal whole, something entertaining will appeal to audiences more than something not. And I don’t think you could call Jeanne Dielman entertaining.\n\nIf leftists or liberals want to get certain political messages across, they should approach it like Eisenstein did, with vitality and energy.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "On Feb. 02, [K. Viswanath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Viswanath) passed away at age 92. He's widely considered in the top 5 directors in the Telugu film industry, if not the greatest. Since Telugu cinema is on the rise in the Western world in the wake of Baahubali and RRR, I feel it's only a matter of time until his films are brought up in the west considering his films are essentially all art films — literally! Many of his most well-renowned films are about artists, musicians, dancers, etc.\n\nHis films generally criticized and challenged regressive social norms (e.g. abuse and violence towards women, caste discrimination, and dowry to name a few) while championing traditional art forms like Carnatic music and Kuchipudi (the Telugu states' dance form). Despite this, his films were widely successful at the box office and became entrenched in Telugu culture to this day. In addition, his films are well-known to this day for their strong women protagonists, which gave opportunities for legendary actresses to cement their mark on Telugu cinematic history.\n\n---\n\nK. Viswanath has a huge filmography, so this is not an exclusive list of his most well-known films by any means, but these are the \"classics\" that my family loves the most. I've also included links to watch them on YouTube (for free), along with some of my favorite songs in each of his films. I'd recommend watching the song clips to get a taste of what the full movie is like!\n\n* [Sankarabharanam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV6qTLAJlos) (\"The Jewelry of Shiva\")\n\t- The daughter of a sex worker dreams of dancing to the singing of an elderly Brahmin Carnatic musician whose fame is waning due to the popularization of pop music.\n\t- [\"Sankara Naadasarirapara\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xrJTAKJotg)\n* [Saptapadi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0bwXBKoVG8) (\"The Seven Steps of Marriage\")\n\t- A Brahmin priest learns that his daughter is in love with a flutist of a lower caste.\n* [Sagara Sangamam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS2n93wsyNw) (\"Confluence with the Ocean\")\n\t- Kamal Hassan plays an incredibly talented dancer in multiple traditional South Indian dance forms with an honest heart retains true respect for the art form, resulting in him becoming an alcoholic as the demand for Western dancers grows in Telugu society.\n\t- [\"Takita Tadimi\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-qgOqg9kP4) - The drunk protagonist dances on a well near his home during a thunderstorm without regard for the danger. This is probably my favorite scene and song from any of his films.\n* [Swathi Muthyam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mrNjfl2lmw) (\"White Pearl\")\n\t- A widow and her young son meet a kind-hearted intellectually disabled man who offers to marry her.\n\t- [\"Suvvi Suvvi Suvvalamma\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsuOontkJH4)\n* [Sirivennela](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRelzDlRzHI) (\"Moonlight\")\n\t- About the relationships between a blind flautist, a deaf painter, and a tour guide who was once a sex worker.\n\t- [\"Vidhata Talapuna\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLtLiiQu5g) - This is at the climax of the film, so spoilers! :D\n* [Swarnakamalam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qoST4Hj8sk) (\"The Golden Lotus\")\n\t- A talented Kuchipudi dancer believes that life as a dancer isn't feasible in society, but her outlook is challenged by a painter neighbor with whom she falls in love.\n\t- [\"Andela Ravamidhi Padamulada\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjcfPhtDmWk) - The dancing of Bhanupriya here is simply breathtaking.\n* [Swathi Kiranam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUzU6Zw5068) (\"Dawn of Light\")\n\t- An aging traditional singer struggles to cope with being eclipsed by the vocal talent of a young prodigy in his village. This film is very strongly inspired by Amadeus, but framing it in the context of Carnatic music and adding the class distinction between the two makes this worth a watch.\n\n--\n\nAs you can see, one of the main themes in K. Viswanath's career is the struggle of artists in traditional South Indian / Telugu art forms (Carnatic music, Kuchipudi dance, etc.) as the society around them is experiencing modernization.\n\nHis films are particularly renowned for their musical artistry. He forged significant partnerships with lyricists like Veturi Sundararama Murthy (see [\"Takita Tadimi\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-qgOqg9kP4)) and Sirivennela Seetarama Sastry (see [\"Vidhata Talapuna\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaLtLiiQu5g)), and composers like Ilaiyaraaja.\n\n---\n\nLater in his career, he also began acting in commercial films when it interested him, most often cameoing as an elderly family patriarch. Although he is generally far more renowned as a director, that added a bit to his fame.\n\nBtw, I'm an Indian-American and my main source of knowledge of his filmography comes from watching his films with my family at home as I was growing up, so apologies if I've made any errors in the post.\n\n---\n\nOne last thing: you may have noticed that most of his \"classics\" start with the letter S (స/శ/ష - there's three S consonants in Telugu 🙂). That's not a coincidence; I believe he intended that as both a \"lucky charm\" but also as a tribute to the goddess of knowledge, Saraswati.",

But Bergman himself apparently wasn't happy about cutting it down, saying it was \"extremely troublesome, as I had to cut into the nerves and lifeblood of the film\".\n\nSo with that in mind, why did he? I mean, of course one can speculate on a whole number of reasons. Pressure from his funders and producers to recoup their investment, requests from distributors who'd supported his past work, perhaps even Bergman's desire to reach his cinema-going fanbase. I guess I'm just surprised that I can't find an actual definitive explanation somewhere.\n\nAny film school nerds know what went down? I guess this would apply to *Scenes from a Marriage* too.",

Even though we have a court system, there's no guarantee that this is actually a fair trial - and depending on how lucky you are, you might be found innocent. \n\nThere was this man who was the forefront of pleading guilty throughout the entire movie, and there was a man exactly like that in my Jury. Talking about 'these kids' and 'you know the type' and 'they're smart, they know what they're doing', 'I see kids like this every day,' it was frankly disgusting and hard to hear. Even though the guy in the movie didn't have the same reasons for doing so, it was clear that this only played out the way it did in retaliation to situations from his own life.\n\nI feel like there are few people that would speak out like our 'protagonist' and even though I was the one outlier, it doesn't mean that I was right or that I voiced my opinions well, and I feel like he's a type of kind and strong role model to strive towards.\n\nThis movie is one that I wish I watched when I was younger. \n\nThe way the two initial 'not guilty' jurors introduced themselves to each other at the end of the movie was also extremely touching, and the shot of the last juror walking soberly with this new realisation that he was entrenched in his bias all along is an incredible shot.\n\nAll the actors were also incredible. \n\nI've also just started the 1957 version LOL",

        "text": "Here is Ingmar Bergman's opinion on the purpose of art film. I found it to be interesting and inspiring and I thought I'd share:\n\n\"People ask what are my intentions with my films--my aims. It is a difficult and dangerous question, and I usually give an evasive answer: I try to tell the truth about the human condition, the truth as I see it. This answer seems to satisfy everyone, but it is not quite correct. I prefer to describe what I would like my aim to be. There is an old story of how the cathedral of Chartres was struck by lightning and burned to the ground. Then thousands of people came from all points of the compass, like a giant procession of ants, and together they began to rebuild the cathedral on its old site. They worked until the building was completed--master builders, artists, labourers, clowns, noblemen, priests, burghers. But they all remained anonymous, and no one knows to this day who built the cathedral of Chartres.\n\nRegardless of my own beliefs and my own doubts, which are unimportant in this connection, it is my opinion that art lost its basic creative drive the moment it was separated from worship. It severed an umbilical cord and now lives its own sterile life, generating and degenerating itself. In former days the artist remained unknown and his work was to the glory of God. He lived and died without being more or less important than other artisans; 'eternal values,' 'immortality' and 'masterpiece' were terms not applicable in his case. The ability to create was a gift. In such a world flourished invulnerable assurance and natural humility. Today the individual has become the highest form and the greatest bane of artistic creation.\n\nThe smallest wound or pain of the ego is examined under a microscope as if it were of eternal importance. The artist considers his isolation, his subjectivity, his individualism almost holy. Thus we finally gather in one large pen, where we stand and bleat about our loneliness without listening to each other and without realizing that we are smothering each other to death. The individualists stare into each other's eyes and yet deny the existence of each other.\n\nWe walk in circles, so limited by our own anxieties that we can no longer distinguish between true and false, between the gangster's whim and the purest ideal. Thus if I am asked what I would like the general purpose of my films to be, I would reply that I want to be one of the artists in the cathedral on the great plain. I want to make a dragon's head, an angel, a devil--or perhaps a saint--out of stone. It does not matter which; it is the sense of satisfaction that counts.\n\nRegardless of whether I believe or not, whether I am a Christian or not, I would play my part in the collective building of the cathedral.\"\n\nIf you are interested in making art film in Austin send me a message.",

        "text": "“Your Premise is Flawed.”\n\nTime for a return to Shyamalan. He broke into the industry with meteoric trajectory thanks to The Sixth Sense and will always be most known for the film’s legendary final twist. The real twist, however, is that unbeknownst to anyone, The Sixth Sense would represent a microcosm of the talented director’s entire career: a twisting, zigzagging, unpredictable dive into the horror/thriller genre, anchored by a seemingly limitless supply of always-just-untapped potential. His films are always unique, and the best – Sixth Sense, Signs, Unbreakable, and The Village (yeah, sue me) – are careful meditations on perception with hints of horror and slanted comedy. \n\nHis worst films – you know the ones – are self-indulgent, incoherent slogs which awkwardly grind against his patient, subtle eye as a visual stylist. Knock at the Cabin is not his worst film (taking that crown is nigh impossible) but may be his most predictable and least inspired. Categorizing good Shyamalan from bad is easy to do, but Knock at the Cabin is distinct in its laborious attempt to feel and act like the former while transparently being the latter.\n\nThe film follows Eric, Andrew, and Wen, a family vacationing at a secluded cabin. When four strangers arrive, speaking of sacrifice and the apocalypse, the family must decide what to believe, pitting their love for one another against the seeming weight of the greater good.\n\nThe film is a chamber piece, taking place almost entirely in a single cabin with seven characters. This simple fact sinks the entire affair. Everything about Knock is thin: its premise, its visual presentation, its themes, its characters, its “lore”, and its reason for being. There is not enough context, information, or explanation posited, to the characters or the audience, to justify spending nearly the entire film trapped in the cabin. \n\nIn theory, the film should be either a taut, claustrophobic snapshot of a day, or a reflective, multi-layered, extended rumination on the trolley problem, but Knock at the Cabin’s central conceit and greater aspirations are so vague, and the story so resourceless, that it’s little more than a repetitive, redundant, tedious bore. \n\nThe story is frustratingly narrow yet shamelessly half baked, an intriguing first draft which is simply never developed in any meaningful way. A wider scope or more conventional structure would have at least created a forward-moving, step-by-step plot and some organic character revelations; instead, the repetition and sameness of setting creates only an endless, unfocused, and unhelpful bickering match.\n\nShyamalan’s visual decisions do his film no favors either. He evokes unfavorable memories of Mark Walberg in the Happening with incessant use of comically tight closeups and further channels his inner hack by ripping off Jonathan Demme’s just-speak-directly-into-the-camera technique. The cinematography is pretty enough but does nothing to foster contemplation or raw dread. Shyamalan the drudging screenwriter is reasonably expected; Shyamalan the hopelessly floundering shot composer is new to the palate and tough to swallow.\n\nThe patience of his camera (his most admirable trait as a visual storyteller) persists, but his signature foreboding does not, and its absence only reinforces its necessity in keeping his films tense and engaging. In Shyamalan’s best work, the atmosphere and surroundings hold evil seldom seen, darkened and ominous to those daring to peek in. In Knock at the Cabin the sun shine brightly, the woodsy surroundings pose no threat, and the central danger is in plain view, speaking softly, blandly, unambiguously.\n\nThe film is also hampered by its casting decisions and performances. Dave Bautista is severely miscast, attempting admirably, but failing miserably, to play a soft-spoken, everyman second grade teacher. Not since Schwarzenegger’s kindergarten cop has a strongman so implausibly tried to pass as a gentle, thoughtful presence. Arnold had the advantage of displaying affection for his tykes and developing a relevant arc – Bautista has no such benefit. The other actors (Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Dave Bautista, Rupert Grint, Abby Quinn, and Kristen Cui) are reasonably cast but equally irritating.\n\nKnock at the Cabin is ludicrously overwrought; the entire cast chews on their lines with open mouths, furiously wheezing, panting, balling, pausing, and *emphasizing* each word. Despite little information being given, in any capacity, every line is the most important of the film, and each actor slowly suffocates in its unearned self-seriousness. As a nitpicky aside, Groff and Aldridge are also physically similar, making it difficult to keep straight their razor thin but opposing characterizations.\n\nThe final and most damning elements of Knock at the Cabin are its effects and attempts at visual exposition. Perhaps the most bizarrely overlooked trait of Shyamalan’s films (both his best and worst) is the clunky yet vital exposition given via poorly emulated news broadcasts. As in The Happening and Signs, narratively detached news anchors are an essential source of exposition and plotting, conveniently stating the facts most pertinent to timely character concerns throughout. \n\nThese broadcasts also feature the bulk of Knock at the Cabin’s effects, which are shockingly cheap and inarguably distracting. The film is supposed to be a tale of world-burning, apocalyptic terror, but can only muster one mighty tsunami wave to invoke true awe and fear. The other catastrophes are either visually incompetent or entirely, perplexingly, non-visual.\n\nOverall, Knock at the Cabin is disappointing because it offers so little for audiences of varying expectations. Those who are excited for vintage “so bad it’s good” Shyamalan will have nothing to sink their talons into (the effects are terrible but brief). Those looking for vintage “so good it’s good” Shyamalan will be dismayed by the lack of atmosphere, plot, or subversion the director built his career on. Those looking for a director to mature or progress in his style or substance will grimace as he reverses sensibilities in both. This is a thin, predictable, repetitive, and maddeningly vague film which scoffs at variance of interpretation and leaves no impact. Most simply stated, Knock at the Cabin is a whole lotta’ nothin’.\n\n4/9",

        "text": "The scene starts at 4:35 and ends at 8:18.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbv4A54HHSY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbv4A54HHSY)\n\nBy this point in the film we are witnessing a long, gigantic sequence of a Shooting Day in a Silent Movie Set. Dozens of filming sets, workers running around, extras recreating a medieval battle in the background, bombs and arrows dropping everywhere, fire, screaming, whip-pans accidents and deaths - it’s pure chaos. An adrenaline rush which lasts for about 30/40 minutes in the film.\n\nI’m going to take this small segment out of it, because in my opinion, it “summarizes” the point the movie it's trying to make - and it’s fantastically edited, scored, and the cinematography is outstanding too.\n\nI refer to this movie as a celebration to the passionate - to the souls who poured their lives, their blood, sweat and tears into the art of filmmaking. From a director to a production assistant. “Babylon” wants us to slow down a bit, and appreciate every single person who worked behind those movies we love so much, who suffered under the influence of Hollywood, and maybe didn’t even make it out alive. These people deserved to be remembered, at least by us… most of them were already forgotten by the industry.\n\nThis scene encapsulates most of the words I’ve written above:\n\nWe’ve got Manny arriving with the camera which was so hard to obtain, THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF LIGHT! You’ve got Nellie trying to give that LAST PERFECT TEAR - a bunch of people helping Jack Conrad who is drunk as fuck to leave the tent and walk uphill - A SET IS ON FIREE- DOESN’T MATTER KEEP ROLLING - the orchestra starts playing… Jack is about to throw up but finally breaks into character… Bombs start dropping. Hundreds of extras in the background - the perfect single tear… the kiss… the butterfly… everyone covered in a GOLDEN SUNSET. Covered in dirt, after hours of work. It ends with screams of victory as the sun finally hides behind the mountains.\n\nI can’t get enough of this scene. It 's perfection. It’s the definition of the MAGIC in filmmaking - hundreds of people giving everything they got just for THAT PERFECT SHOT. The passion, the love… the spontaneity and beauty of a butterfly landing on an actor's shoulder.\n\nMy favorite shot probably has to be at minute 7:23. Because you can see how much effort it took to get such a simple, yet powerful shot. As an audience we wouldn’t be even aware of this, but “Babylon” shows us how all the CHAOS that happens on set, turns into MAGIC once captured in camera. Everyone involved in the filmmaking stays immortal once their work is printed into film. Yet, immortality isn’t the same as being remembered. It’s pure cinema.\n\nThere are some other things I could analyze about this scene (like the burning set), but this is the main analysis I wanted to make.\n\nBy the way, the theme playing during this scene is “Golden Coast Sunset”. It fits perfectly to one of the most thrilling and mesmerizing scenes I’ve ever watched. The chills...\n\n(I'm sorry if my english is too rough... It's not my native language and I was too thrilled while writing this).",

The main antagonist and the one considered to be the dictator of the whole hospital is also a white woman.\n\nIf I had to make a interpretation, it may have to do with it being about how in pretty much the same way black cops are still ultimately cops despite cops being known to target mostly black people, the aides are there to use force to maintain the status quo and oppress the marginalized.

        "text": "Don’t mind downvotes but learn much from you and would love to learn perspectives to any and all points below. Some women a little older than her character in certain fields have similar propensities—anecdotal but compelling observations. Might be attributed to potential earlier wounds or feelings of deprivation and not class envy per se but wanting more. Admirable, but is this common among women of a certain age in not lifting up other women unless transactional? White women especially and in more elite environments? Or where excellence is nearly necessary?\n\nDo you think having her as a lesbian is critical to the film? Blanchett is an icon and very admired on various levels. Of course I see the many NFSW posts when I search for Tar or Oscars threads but rarely look—indeed she is also a sex symbol to some, an artist to other, and potentially a master or icon to others. She plays many complex women. But most are not overly pathologized by critics and viewers. \n\nI learned there was a scene with her mother and a nude scene that were cut from the film. Do you think the film worked so well because we had less access to Tar, particularly more intimate knowledge?\n\nThe childhood scene, which some say is regressive is powerful but brief and not overdone. \n\nClearly Freud and others discuss narcissism and trauma plus parental relations in association with same sex admiration, eroticism, and relations. This would be such a different film with a man or a more straight identified woman as Tar. What do you think of this choice and it is a choice. I don’t quite understand the backlash because I am not at the upper tiers of a professional world such as this but another one where ego and narcissism of small differences etc. \n\nMy last question relates to class. We do not discuss this much in relation to the film. Common but not a trope. Is class the core driving force and wanting to create meaningfulness and then to try to experience more and retain it. \n\nLastly, I hear the term self sabotage used often and Yeoh states this in a Variety talk with the actress playing Tar. Academy voters state the film is polarizing. I would watch films with complex or unlikable women when younger and some critics would focus on pathology or mental illness. But have we changed where we see more of ourselves in characters like Tar due to greater self awareness and understanding. Last question-do you have empathy for her?\n\nI see her errors and the suicide was certainly not positive. But do you connect to her modest childhood and think of you were in her circle, but not purely as a transactional figure, you would want to support her? Comfort her? Is no one there for that?\n\nShe does vomit and leave the massage parlor so no sociopathy and maybe a longing for intimacy and connection she lacked as a child without many like her/sharing interests but misguided? Were the motivations and acts of sex/intimacy or whatever you categorize it as an attempt to experience closeness to great people in her field or simply about power. Please I don’t mind downvotes but is this different than Weinstein or Ailes and others? Women are a mirror of her and from where she came and all of her growth, wonder, fulfillment and meaning in becoming good at what she does? Do I see her as more noble and committed to the art? Greatness? \n\nOr is it also that certain women are also drawn to her and she fulfills a fantasy to them of what is possible? Not only self-actualization but mastery in a field where there are few? \n\nPeople speak about Kubrick and it seems like this also speaks to conceptions of the artist and the art. But is what Tar does different than not specific acts per se between men and women because it is a woman and another woman but also women on the same professional track so to speak. The suicide is tragic and real but surely much similar tensions and relations occur across professions? Her assistant left and I imagine others do as well. Plus the latest Russian cellist basically responds with disinterest but not on cruel ways. Is Tar looking for intimacy and understanding but then this seeming rebuff also pushes her off course in unhelpful ways? \n\nAre many of us drawn to a human like that or do you see the less helpful behaviors and patterns and immediately protect and distance yourself? Or become more drawn in when she does acknowledge one/you/me and there are so few as great or masterful as her in our field. She does feel guilt over the suicide?",

        "text": "What is the overarching theme of There Will Be Blood? A couple stabs:\n\nReligion: obviously Eli is a self-professed prophet and the theme of religion looms large over the proceedings. Even the title is tinged with religion, as we can’t hear There Will Be Blood without thinking of Daniel crying out for the Lord’s blood as he’s baptized, a cry that’s answered by the bloody crescendo of the film. Oil is Daniel’s religion, and power. He’s not the Jesus Christ figure of this piece; he’s God. He looms over the small metropolis he’s created in Little Boston. He wields power like a righteous sword. His fervor matches Eli’s in every way, which is why they’re the perfect foils. Consecrated, steadfast believers both, just in opposing things. Or are they so opposed? It could be argued that both men seek power before salvation. Salvation in the almighty dollar is what they serve. Which brings us to:\n\nPower: If power is Daniel’s religion, then he spends the entire film on a righteous mission. He’s even shown proselytizing, coming from “half a state” away to preach oil and sweep up land. He garners disciples and sycophants alike. He’s like the Old Testament God. Anyone who slights him is dealt with swiftly and with impunity. He and Eli crave power more than anything, one through money, the evil of capitalism, and the other through religion, the opiate of the masses. Both are looking to sway as many people, to wield as much power as they can.\n\nPride: Power leads to pride. Daniel takes pride in his money, in his moxie, in his abilities. He at one time takes pride in HW, his lucky and lucrative find that turns not so lucky and lucrative. He’s simply a prideful man. And his pride constantly blinds him. His pride keeps him from going to Bandy. His pride leads him to explosively disconnect from HW, not once but twice. His pride even takes the wheel when he’s humbling himself in front of Eli’s congregation, as it’s just another method to get what he wants. \n\nPatriarchy: Masculinity was clearly on PTA’s mind when he created this film. There are no substantial female characters. The one character we see from an attachment with a woman - HW - is seen by Daniel as the weakest person in the story, constantly emasculated and belittled by him. Just by decree of the setting and time period, this has to be a masculine story. I think that masculinity breeds the pride that comes from the power that is a religion. So maybe this is the overarching theme of the film, to me. Patriarchy is a tool of capitalism, so it and greed, power go hand in hand in hand. These are the systems that keep us oppressed, kill pitiless workers like Joe Gundha, and even backhandedly harm the harbingers of capitalism, the owners and imperialists, because when we indulge in greed, people lose their importance. And when people lose their importance, we end up abandoning then rejecting our child, becoming a drunk and beating a man to death with a bowling pin. And not even being blessed with a redemption arc. \n\nSuch a beautifully shot film, maybe PTA’s most beautiful. The score is a knockout, maybe better than Phantom Thread. I really loved it. A true epic fable on celluloid. Biblical, but American, like if Steinbeck met Job. I didn’t even touch on the Biblical scope of the film or the Cain and Able allusions when I analyzed the religious aspects. There’s so much to say. What’s your critique?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10s53hr/tár_and_how_the_audience_is_persuaded_by_the_flow/",
        "text": "**ALL SPOILERS AHEAD**\n\nIf this theory has already been expressed on here before, I'll likely delete this post.\n\nI watched Tár a couple of nights ago and I ended up having mixed feelings about it. Todd Field created a story full of mystery, and, at times, surrealism to make for a film that should ended up more as a thriller than a drama based in the social commentary of today's world culture. The writing, the characters, the feeling of intrigue through the film kept me hooked and eager to have at least some of the questions answered in the end. However, this intrigue only lasted for about 3/4 of the film unfortunately.\n\nBut was this all done on purpose? Did Field lead us on through careful and deliberate writing specifically for the film's ultimate ending that made sure not to fully reveal all of the details of ANYTHING? Did you think Lydia deserved her downfall?\n\nAfter having a couple days to fully digest the film...I'd say no. Lydia was the victim.\n\n\"It's always the question that involves the listener, never the answer.\"\n\nI'll admit...as someone who enjoys ambiguous films that don't hold your hand or wrap up mysteries with a bow at the end, I was really hoping this film did so. I felt the biggest cinematic blue balls I've had in a long while since my then young and developing cinematic brain experienced the end of Inception in theaters. All of this is besides the point, but will does somehow connect with my reasoning as to why Lydia got completely screwed.\n\nThroughout the entire film, there's a lot of unexplained weirdness unfolding on screen. The iPhone chats while filming Lydia, the gifts given to Lydia that she gets spooked by, the haunting occurrences in her house. All of these are intended to confuse the audience as much as it is to confuse Lydia.\n\nSome theories suggest these hauntings are Lydia's guilt, but what does she have to be guilty about? It's never explicitly said, only suggested the horrible things she may or may not have done to Krista, who is hailed as a hero for dealing with and succumbing to Lydia's alleged abuse...wherein lies the problem not just for Lydia's career, but for some cases of cancel culture as a whole. In Lydia's case, it's all suggested and alleged, and nothing more.\n\nLydia's biggest mistake was admitting e-mails didn't exist, which was thrown back in her face at the deposition. Another mistake being firing Francesca who was not only close to Lydia but to Krista as well, as made known by the story when the two spoke shortly after Krista's suicide about a trip the three of them took.\n\nDespite ALL of this...the important thing is the story we were told on screen. And nothing that was told on screen incriminates Lydia or proves she was abusing Krista or any other women. It doesn't matter if she even gets in the face of a grade school girl who's bullying her daughter and saying she's Petra's father (that was a great touch) and she will strike her down if she touches Petra again...sure, it's a power move on her part, playing the \"no one will believe you\" to a child...but again, it's all shown but not proven that she's done things like this before.\n\nAll we ever knew about Krista was Lydia saw her as mentally \"odd\" and clearly unstable, and you know what? She very well could have been. Maybe she had an obsession with Lydia, with or without an affair between them occurring? On the other side of the coin, we unfortunately don't know a lot about Krista either other than the info we're given in the film by Lydia and Francesca alike, so we can't know whether she was either truly crazy, obsessive and suicidal from the start, or depressive, manic and suicidal by Lydia's own doing.\n\n--------------\n\nIn my opinion, Todd Field wrote a genius story, that has virtually no wrong answers as long as it's rooted in the logic of the story. It's a commentary on how people in midst of cancel culture can have their lives destroyed by unsubstantiated fabrications that have no strong evidence to back it up other than \"yeah they do seem like the type of person to do that though...\", and manipulation of technology to create more fabrication and false evidence to the original accusations. I don't think the film was as strong as it could have been, but in respect to Field, he wasn't going for a psychological thriller about a mad conductor who's one finale performance was a fit of rage after spiraling down a path of madness and insanity. I wish it could have been that kind of story. However, he was strictly aiming for a film about today's culture and how it can affect even the most renown, respected, hardest working and most passionate of artists or cultural figures...and EGOT winners for the matter.\n\nI hope this theory of the film splits the room and creates discussion. I know the majority may likely not agree with the views of cancel culture in context to the film...\n\n...in which case all I have to say is...\"Don’t be so eager to be offended. The narcissism of small differences leads to the most boring conformity.”",

        "text": "I rewatched this last night and haven't quite seen my interpretation anywhere so thought I'd drop it in here.\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin is about how humans, separated from animals, intellectualize themselves into conflict. Pádraic is pure niceness/stupidity, mirrored by the animals prominently featured in the film. Colm, through humanly seeking to immortalize himself via his art, represents conflict/intelligence, and is mirrored by the cross imagery, which figures in the conflict between Protestants and Catholics and the Irish Civil War. The niceness/stupidity vs conflict/intelligence dichotomy resembles the one/many dichotomy. Reality is unified until humans via their intellect divide it up into categories/identities, which, apart from the violence of slicing up the world, also inevitably leads to conflict between these categories as the differences become irresolvable. Pádraic's harmonious stupidity is slowly made untenable as Colm separates himself. This separation of friends becomes the separation of humans from animals. Colm's mind distinguishes itself from Pádraic and becomes the identity of an artist, promising the afterlife humans so crave. Pádraic doesn't understand this desire because he is subrational, without an identity. But after Siobhan (God?) leaves and his donkey dies, he reaches a literal and figurative breaking point when he shatters the mirror, shattering his noncognitive harmony into reasons and concepts. Pádraic then intellectualizes himself into conflict with Colm. Before, with Pádraic's being a subrational creature, he didn't see that his trying to reconcile with Colm was causing Colm to cut off his fingers, which would belie his niceness if he were rational. But then, when his donkey accidentally eats a finger and dies, he rationalizes the death as caused by Colm and thereby a cause for conflict, becoming human. At the end after Colm mentions the Civil War possibly being over, Pádraic says, \"I'm sure they'll be at it again soon enough, aren't you? Some things there's no moving on from and I think that's a good thing,\" suggesting it's good to be human even if it means endless casus belli.",

Pushing this idea further, I’ve understood the film to be a demonstration on the dynamics of power, and how there is an inherent abuse of this power by those who hold it. \n\nIn the film, Motome is coerced into the harakiri by the three highest ranking samurai. These samurai hide behind the samurai code as a reason for forcing him to kill himself, claiming that it is honourable for a samurai to follow through. Although by Kobayashi’s stellar craft of cinema, it shows that there are darker motivations beneath the surface. They want Motome to go through with it because they seem to revel in the power, wielding it with a cruel authority as they force him to kill himself with the blunt bamboo.\n\nThis is a quality of humanity throughout history - those in power often like to see people squirm mostly because they can. In this instant, they hide behind honour code, much like how authority figures hide behind religious doctrine and cultural tradition in society today.\n\nKobayashi’s masterpiece is microcosmic of a wider condition of humanity - those in power often abuse it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts of the film?",

        "text": "Robert Greene in the Laws of Human Nature advised people to face their own shadows. It is in understanding one’s dark side that one can integrate one’s personality more fully, rather than have this dark side appearing in the most unfortunate of circumstances. Over the past few years, I have had friends who have knowledge in psychology, and they have helped me to identify the rather unsavory aspects of my personality. \n\nConfucius noted that there are three methods towards gaining wisdom: “By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.”\n\nAs someone who is rather conservative and pensive, **Babylon** offered an excellent medium by which I could gain wisdom without bitterness and allow my own dark side to coalesce with my personality. The first 30 minutes is an excellent introduction to the opulent and decadent world of 1920s Hollywood peopled by characters who, despite their fame and fortune, live tragic lives. \n\nThe film begins during the set up of one of the bacchanalias offered by a Hollywood studio executive, and it opens with the logistical problem of transporting an elephant into the executive’s mansion, which is atop a hill. Chazelle ably chronicles the excesses of the prominent stars at the time, being loose, not only with morals, but also with self-control and impulses. The depravity is further highlighted when an obese actor fond of piss play actually causes a bit actress to overdose. The camerawork is nimble, as the focus shifts from character to character, and the contrast between the more self-possessed Manny is emphasized against the incendiary Nellie. \n\nHow the main characters stories intertwine with each other over the course of the epic film was deftly told by Chazelle. As a student of cinema, I also absolutely loved how Chazelle alluded to the giants of the time as silent films were slowly effaced by the arrival of sound films. The German director of the epic war film was likely F.W. Murnau, who also directed one of the earliest Oscar winners for *Sunrise*. \n\nI also loved how the script injected anachronisms that those who are also familiar with cinema’s evolution find funny: for instance, Jack Conrad, in successive lines, alludes to both **The Terminator** and **Gone with the Wind**, films that didn’t even exist at the time. I laughed with “frankly Scarlett, you’re a cunt,” which was the vulgar equivalent of Gone with the Wind’s final line, “frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.” It was also a clue as to whom Jack Conrad was based on: the 1939 film’s lead actor was Clark Gable, who was a notorious ladies’ man and adulterer, and also an avid smoker and drinker. \n\nNellie LaRoy’s character was likely an amalgam of many actresses who faded with time, but because of her relationship with Fay Zhu (who was likely based from Anna May Wong, one of the first capable Chinese-American actresses and also a lesbian), a part of her was likely based on Marlene Dietrich. I know this because I appreciate good cinema and am precisely one of the film’s target audiences. As a student of film history, these Easter eggs allowed me to appreciate the film more.\n\nHowever, the film is worth watching solely for the excellent ensemble performances. Margot Robbie is in her element as Nellie LaRoy, a natural actress and seductress. When she was given a part out of sheer luck, she shows her ability as an actress and sees her star rise rapidly. However, because she is also unfocused and impulsive, she eventually develops a drug habit she couldn’t cope with and gambling debts she couldn’t pay. \n\nIn their first meeting at the bacchanalia, she bewitches Manny Torres, and the rest of the film features him trying to catch up and protect her. While Manny is the film’s moral center, remaining circumspect and discreet despite his ascent, Jack Conrad’s falling star is placed vis-à-vis his rise. Conrad loves cinema, but eventually realizes that he could no longer cope with the other rising stars as the world moved toward sound films. \n\nI have no qualms with regard to the performances of the main characters, and do think this was one of Robbie’s best performances. I do understand how it can be off-putting to many: Babylon is definitely a polarizing film, because unlike **La La Land**, it doesn’t shy away from showing the seedy, dirty, immoral, and dissolute side of Hollywood, even then. Even a top actor like Jack Conrad has to be set aside once his star has fallen, and that remains true of fame even today. It \n\nOne critic stated that while La La Land was an ode to Hollywood, this was more of a malediction against it, and many people will certainly find the film tasteless. \n\nHowever, next to **Decision to Leave**, Babylon has surprised me as one of my favorites of 2022, precisely because of Manny Torres. Manny Torres is an INTJ, and it shows, from the very first scene, that he is a creative and cerebral problem-solver. Over the course of the film, he rises within Hollywood precisely because he keeps on solving problems creatively, and also tries to provide solutions to allow the woman he loves, Nellie, to escape Hollywood and its poisons. An immature ESFP and INTJ, however, is a doomed relationship even from the very start.\n\nNo matter what one can do, some people just cannot be helped, like Nellie and Jack Conrad. And despite this, the Hollywood machine chugs along. Notwithstanding all the opulence, decadence, debauchery, and waste, great films are inevitably created time and time again. \n\nBabylon is among those, for me. \n\n9/10",

Rango is nothing like a $150M animated film and how comfortably does Lone Ranger stand amongst Westerns? Cure for Wellness is a separate thing altogether. Even before, his grounded movies like The Ring &amp; Mousehunt have flashes of typical Verbinskiness, the latter in particular. The premise of Mousehunt is laughable even for a live action kids movie, but somehow he makes it work for a full feature length. Verbinski is his own genre. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen comes action. Boy does he have an eye for action. Let me be frank and bold, I place him in the top 3 directors who do spectacle best. The list is: James Cameron, Peter Jackson &amp; Gore Verbinski. The waterwheel scene from Dead Man's Chest along with the 2 kraken fights, the maelstrom battle in At World's End, the final train sequence which is mind boggling how it was done in Lone Ranger &amp; then Rango has the fight with the mole people which keeps on getting crazier. In fact Verbinski just keeps on raising the stakes and bizareness in his action scenes and it never stops being entertaining.\n\nA criticism I have seen people direct towards Verbinski is that he does not do emotion well. I disagree because, though he does not serve it on a platter, his movies are able to conjure up feelings. I will admit that he does sometimes stray too far in weirdness.\n\nHe played a key role in getting Depp to do his Jack the way he wanted when Disney execs were unsure about it. This is interesting because Gore has been working with massive budgets with executive interference being a must. Yet despite that, you cannot fault his movies of being corporate products. But the sad result is that despite bringing a lot of success to Disney through his Pirates movies, they bailed on him once the terrible box office reciepts of Lone Ranger came in. I am sympathetic to Lone Ranger, it is entertaining and fun. But it's clear it was not going to be a hit. I think Disney should have continued to back him, with lower budgets at least. There is a night and day difference in the Pirates series since he left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was in the works to make a Bioshock film which did not end up happening but it just shows his taste for variety. After dealing with horror, psycho-horror, fantasy epic, dramas, comedy, animated and a Western, he was targetting sci-fi next.\n\n As a fan of his, his absence from the screen is really disappointing. He won't be forgotten anytime soon as he has made popular movies. But he is only 58 and still has much to offer I feel. He is apparently making an animated film next:[https://deadline.com/2022/09/gore-verbinski-netflix-animated-movie-cattywumpus-1235106046/](https://deadline.com/2022/09/gore-verbinski-netflix-animated-movie-cattywumpus-1235106046/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Verbinski and what are your favorite films of his?",

        "text": "Often overshadowed by it’s festive cousin “The Nightmare Before Christmas”, Tim Burton doubles down on the victorian goth aesthetic in the best way possible, with an all star cast to boot. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Christopher Lee all have excellent performances in this stop motion flick. It’s the most Tim Burton movie possible, where every bench is the repurposed coffin, losing limbs is a constant bit, and the world of the dead is far more colorful than the land of the living. Yet under all the charismatic doom and gloom lies an affecting love story, of a young man caught between his living betrothed, and the titular corpse bride. The plot is full of murder mystery and intrigue, and though I rarely cry at movies, the ending brought me to tears. Also, fantastic humor. Puns that will actually make you laugh. Soundtrack is great too, the piano work is simply superb. Cast has chemistry, the stop motion is smooth and contains lots of character. I just recommend all around. Tell me what you think.",

The repressed, pure paranoia of De Roller as he tries to balance his own dread and investigation with his relations on the island just felt so vast despite how sparse the plot was and the film was just so epic and expansive for how minimal it was. I think it could have used a liiiitle more structure/genre elements just for the sake of highlighting the themes of the film but the subtlety already works really well. I'll probably write a longer personal analysis of this film at some point but I'm curious what others who have seen it here think of it.",

        "text": "  \n\nSpoilers Ahead\n\nDiving into Brandon Cronenberg’s newest film (and first exposure to him for me) as a fairly big fan of his Fathers work, I would have to say I was quite excited to give this a go. Now after seeing it while I would say I enjoyed it moderately I can’t help but feel a little let down. When I say that I don’t mean I went into expecting to be blown away but instead because it sets such a thrilling and interesting world for these character that I was ready to see explored. Then when it came down to it at every turn available it was as if it went down the less interesting path. Leading me to feel much more lukewarm on the film then I thought I would by the end of the first act. \n\nGetting into spoilers now the film revolves around the concept of an “Infinity Pool” where in the films foreign country places foreigners who have committed crimes worthy of execution in to create a clone of themselves with their feelings and memories as a stand in for said execution. With this set up it explores themes of self-destruction, the rich and entitled, and Identity; in concept I love each of these and the way the started to be explored but it never felt as though we got beneath the surface of any of them at least to me. I would have loved to see more of the actual cloning my favorite part being the second execution as it seems like it’s not the doubles and then the camera flips to reveal them all cheering on the execution. From this we get the idea that these people don’t care for anything except themselves, and their selfish impulses and I would’ve loved to see them explore the ideas that as long as you have money the rules don’t apply to you and how rich tourist can terrorize foreign countries with no consequences. Unfortunately, it stops there and what we get are more half-hearted explorations of the other various themes. I’ll add though that the I do like how Cronenberg wrote himself into it through James (Skarsgard) as a son who only got his career through his father’s fame and is now a struggling writer trying to live up to that, though again not explored to its full potential.\n\nBeing completely honest I don’t know what it is but Alexander Skarsgard doesn’t do it for me all that much, I wouldn’t go as far as to say it was a bad performance, I might even say it’s good with how he gets emotion across in a fairly quite character but when I’m watching him I feel like something is missing. Mia Goth on the other hand is electric throughout and while I liked her in pearl a lot this gives it quite the run for its money as her best performance yet. The way she screams and antagonizes James is off putting as hell and I loved it. Also, I think the film looks great and has a good sense of style, but those hallucination sequences were tired and uninteresting; I would’ve liked to see something else in there place or just shorted/cut it felt like the film thought it was so cool for having them but so many others have done the same. \n\nOverall, not bad but missed potential in my eyes but from the nepotism alumni’s Cronenberg seems to be one with a lot of passion and an actual eye for it, I’m excited to see what he does next and can see some great things in the future. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the film, what do you feel it did well or badly, and what do you agree or disagree with me on. I’m also trying to improve my writing so any pointers or constructive criticism would be much obliged. Looking forward to hearing some thoughts.",
