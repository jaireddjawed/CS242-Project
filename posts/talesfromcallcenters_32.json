        "text": "So I have worked for a pay TV provider's csc for about 2 years now. I hated it when I first started till about 6 months ago when I was transitioned to field support and commercial. I loved that, I didn't have to put up with the bullshit of customer service, I didn't have to hate myself for being so goddamn fake on the phone. It was great. However, 2 months ago I was told that I would be transitioned into our cancellation department, where we make final offers for customers to stay. We basically beg and plead for them to stay while offering money off of their bill. Nothing sounds more like hell to me than that department. \n\nSo I decided to get fired. I did everything wrong I could. Hanging up on customers, \"toggling\" (logging out of the phone and just setting there not taking calls), changing account statuses down to the lowest possible state. All of it in an attempt to get fired. I have been doing this for 2 months now and finally someone noticed. I was elated that I was FINALLY getting fired. They took me to a meeting room with my manager his manager to have a discussion. They asked me if I knew why I was there and I told them yes and explained everything I was doing. Surprisingly the only thing the knew about was the toggling. They were quite surprised by everything else I was doing. They then proceeded to tell me that because I have been a top performer in my department since I started there that they weren't going to fire me, just put me on a final warning and to never do it again. I guess that I will just have to quit at this point. I really don't know what else to do to get fired and it's slightly infuriating. \n\n\nTl;Dr have been trying for 2 months to get fired by doing all of the fire-able offences, yet I was told that because I am good at my job they're not going to.",

        "text": "I am relieved to have found this group. Somewhere that I can finally express my frustration at the constant ridiculousness of working in a Call Center.\n\nI have worked in a Call Center for nearly two years now, for a Government department. Basically, for the last two years I have sat around listening to nearly constant complaints. About everything you could imagine. Dogs. Trees. The grass in reserves being too long. Rates. Cars being parked in one spot for too long. Neighbours building houses. Too many mosquitoes. You name it - I've heard complaints about it. We are available 24/7, so people can ring in literally anytime day or night to complain about issues, and some poor sap has to answer the phone. Recently, we have had a huge influx of people into the city that I live in, as there has been a real explosion in the housing market. So the population is constantly going up. Which means more people all over the place. Which, inevitably, means more complaints as the city gets busier and people have more things to complain about - often each other.\n\nSome complaints are fair enough, and you would almost begin to feel something for the callers. But so many of them were so ridiculous, and even if the complaints were legitimate, the people phoning them in were so ridiculously angry and frustrated about it you could tell the real issue was nothing to do with what they are calling about, but about them. Being an insightful person who has a strong interest in psychology, I know this. My heart bursts to tell people the truth. But of course I can't do that, as it's not \"professional\". Sooooo, I've just got to sit there and pretend like I care, and try to fix the problem, all the while my rage slowly continues to boil and my faith in humanity drops a little bit lower.\n\nDue to short staffing issues, I have been horrendously overworked over the last year. We are supposed to take between 70 and 90 calls a day. But, because of issues with HR employing new people and a rather large number of people leaving at the same point in time, we ended up being so short staffed I often ended up taking between 130 and 140 calls a day. After this many calls, you are talking nonsense. You're so talked out you barely even know what you're saying. Not to mention your patience and tolerance levels are basically non-existent. Then of course when you get home you've got no energy to say a word to your family and friends. Which is, of course, not good.\n\nI must say I have lost some level of faith in humanity since being at this job. People complain about EVERYTHING. No one takes responsibility for ANYTHING. Just today, I was called a \"c$#t\" because I told a caller ringing about their dog (which was in the pound for the 11th time) that I didn't appreciate the person in the background swearing at me. If they were responsible dog owners to begin with, they wouldn't have had to call in the first place. But no, it's my fault. And how dare I set a personal boundary. Guess they can't afford to get the dog out because their benefit hasn't come in yet. I've been called all kinds of names and sworn at on many occasions. Not to mention Voicemail. I. F$%&amp;ing. Hate. Voicemail. \"Sorry, they're not at their desk right now, would you like to leave a voice message?\" I hate those f#$%ing words with a PASSION. And guess who cops it when other departments don't return voice messages or aren't at their desks to answer the phone? I'll give you one guess. Not that you need it.\n\nI have realized as time has gone on that the amount of f*$#s I truly give about things has diminished severely over time. Just listening to complaints all day about everything under the sun (literally) and dealing with the astounding stupidity and ridiculous expectations of people who ring up demanding things has worn me down. The bitterness, lack of responsibility, entitlement (\"I PAY MY RATES!!\") and literal boredom of some people that are clearly bored to death and have nothing better to do with their lives than ring and complain about ridiculous things has taken its toll on me. I read up the other day about something called \"Compassion Fatigue\". I had never heard about this previously. But I looked through it and just went, yep, yep, yep, tick all the boxes, that's me. I cared when I started. But after the 56,000th barking dog complaint, even though it might be the end of the world for the person on the other end of the line that their neighbours dog is barking, you just stop caring.\n\nI think it's the entitlement that does my head in the most. I can't stand it when people ring and talk about how much better the Government departments were in the city that they came from. I always want to say to them \"Well why did you come here then? Just to moan and whinge and spill your rotten insides out at me??\" Also the \"elders\" (\"I've lived here for xxx amount of years and I am a ratepayer\") and the downright unbelievable (\"Why did the rubbish truck not pick up my rubbish bag with a collection sticker on it that expired 5 years ago??\"). I honestly wonder what would happen if World War 3 struck. Most of these people would curl up into a ball and just die because they'd be so overwhelmed about the amount of things they now have to complain about that the world is going to Hell. Either that or they'd run around like headless chickens trying to find someone to blame or fix the problem for them.\n\nI can honestly say at this point in time - I hate my job. I am just so calloused these days from hearing moaning all the time, being treated like less than a human because I'm on the other end of a stupid headset, and for the ridiculous expectations people place upon us and the inevitable overreaction we have to cop if they don't get what they want. I am so over the sound of ringing phones, seeing that phone queue fill up with calls and hearing the words \"I want to lay a complaint\". I'm. Just. So. Over. It. I have to gear myself up psychologically just to come into work each day. With every call I have ringing in my headset there is a mixture of bravery, indifference and anxiety. The bravery is saying \"bring it on!\" the indifference is saying \"great. Another person wanting something\" and the fear is saying \"what's this one going to be about? is this going to be an abusive call?\" As time has gone on, the indifference has become the strongest emotion out of the three. But it's still not a healthy headspace to be in about your job.\n\nIt hasn't been all bad. I've had some great conversations with some lovely people and received lots of positive feedback, plus the job has toughened me up a bit and made me a bit braver when it comes to dealing with people and more capable of controlling a conversation and asserting myself. Considering the fact that I used to be a total utter wimp, I see how far I  have come now and I am immensely proud of myself for what I've achieved. But I have realized this is not a job you can do forever.\n\nIn the not too distant future, I am leaving. I am going to work in a job more administration based and though I will still get phone calls from time to time (probably from sh*tty people as well) they will be far, far less frequent than what I have had. Most of the time I'll be able to just put my head down and carry on with my task list without interruption - which will be GREAT. A job that works to my strengths. After two years of Call Center, I'm not going to know myself. The relief is going to be palpable.\n\nI guess the only advice I can give to those of you who are still out there in these jobs is to use it as a learning and personal development experience for the time that you are there. Take the positives from it that you can. But be on the lookout for something else. It can be a great training ground to prepare you for better things. But don't remain there too long. \n\nCheers all\n\nDL\n",

        "text": "I don't know what made me think of this but thought you guys might like it.\n\nThis happened last year. I did work in a call center though at that point I was in the chat department(So I was off the phones but still dealing with the same shit. The main difference was that I could laugh at them without them hearing).\n\nOn occasion I got to deal with Fraud issues. It was limited what I could see/do but I could give some information and direct them to the right people. An account could be marked for fraud for many reasons. The most common ones being if the card used to make a purchase was from a different country or had a very different name from the one on the account. Sometimes purchases from countries commonly associated with fraud or certain combinations of products could also trigger it. \n\nNow if the purchase is legitimate it was pretty easy to resolve but until it was resolved the account would be locked. If it isn't able to be resolved or the documentation isn't provided in time (usually within 72 hours) then the order is canceled and refunded and the account remains locked.\n\nSo I get an account that has been locked. Pull it up and it's pretty basic, our fraud department is requesting the information to verify the purchase, blah, blah, blah.\n\nI go over it with the customer, explained what to do and who to contact. There's a little arguing, they want access right now which I can't do.\n\nThen the customer drops this gem:\n\nCustomer: Well I purchased it with a card I found online but want to repurchase it with my own card.\n\nI actually asked him to repeat himself, I was baffled that he literally just admitted to using a stolen card and wasn't sure how to handle it. He did confirm that though, he had in fact used a stolen card.\n\nI asked my supervisor if there was anything I should do and he just looked at me with what I'm sure was the same look I had.\n\nSo I sent the customer on his way, left a note for fraud, and as far as I'm aware he never got access to that account again.\n\nTLDR: Nope, not doing it.

I started as a frontline rep and worked my way up.  I enjoy what I do and I love my team!\n\nMost days are easy-breezy with little to report on, it just so happens not today, my friend.\n\nAround 1:00pm today, I get an email from a member of our escalation team.  He let's me know that one of my reps has made the ultimate boo-boo.  She thought she was muted and instead the customer heard it all.\n\nAdmittedly the agent was pretty rude throughout, interrupting the customer, even muttered \"I hate you\" at one point.  WTF?  The customer wasn't even a handful, pretty chill throughout the call.  She was missing some items in her order and just wanted to get a refund/return, something any of our agents can take care of in less than 3 minutes.  After that is dealt with, the agent asks if there's anything else she needs help with.  The customer asks about an older order she had an issue with, again something we can handle very easily.  Instead she's met with this shitty attitude and well...\n\n* CSR:  I'm just going to be right back, just a sec.\n* Cx:  Okay\n* *CSR thinks* she puts the call on mute \n* CSR:  FUCK fuck FUCK, why the fuck are you bothering with an order this old?  Like, who fucking cares.  It's from fucking 2014 fucking fuck off.\n* *teammate in the background*\n* CSR:  It's just fucking unfair, like I would never fucking do that, it's so fucking stupid.\n* *teammate in the background, telling her to chill and giving her tips on the procedure for old orders, etc.*\n* CSR:  I just think it's fucking stupid and we should murder people who contact us about orders this old.  I want to murder them.  Send them to camps.  We should genocide them.  I love genocide.\n* *teammate, \"You sound like a white person.\" /s*\n* CSR:  Yeah, I'm such a white person, I love genocide.\n\nAt this point she picks the headset back up to tell the customer what she's doing and at first the customer says nothing.  The agent asks, \"Hello?\" and then the customer replies, \"I can't believe you cursed like that about me.\"  &lt;Click&gt;\n\nThe agent not only hung up but just went about her day, probably hoping it would fly under the radar.  I was in a meeting with my management team during the time the call occurred and when I returned, I had the email from our supervisor waiting for me.\n\nI pulled the call and my SKIN CRAWLED.  I had to meet with upper manager, HR, and our legal team who all reviewed the call.  We were all shocked and trying to play damage control because this could be a PR nightmare.  \n\nWe of course fired the agent, she was expecting it when I went to grab her for a \"meeting.\"  I was more disappointed than shocked, honestly.  Once we let her go, I had a quick meeting with the rest of the team to stress to them how easy it is to be overheard and be mindful of what you say on the floor.  \n\nAmazingly, after all of this, the customer was supremely sweet.  She said she was in pure shock but wanted to put it behind her.  I apologized profusely and offered her credit to make up for the craptacular time.  \n\nGlad to have that behind me!",

I know that this didn't take place within the call centre, but still in the same building and the call centre is my main job so I hope that this is okay!\n\n\nIn walks a man who we will call AT for \"angry tenant\", demanding to speak with a manager. Straight away he was hostile, and would only speak with my male colleague (apparently he hates women) but would not tell us why he needed to speak with one. We did some digging and looked at his rent account which was *surprise surprise* in arrears, with a note on from the lady who deals with his rent to say that he needed to fill in a certain form and they would be able to help him. AT will be angry tenant, CO will be my colleague, and ME will be...me.\n\n\n&gt; CO: \"So you've been told you need to fill out [form] and bring in proof of income, have you brought this for us today?\n\n&gt; AT: \"No! And I'm not filling in any forms! No one will help me!\n\n&gt; CO: \"Okay, it's just that you need to fill in this form for us to help you today with paying your rent\"\n\n&gt; AT: \"I'm not paying anything! I'm going to call housing benefit and tell them I'm not working, and just get paid cash in hand! I can't afford to pay anything!\"\n\n**Side note: yes. He said this to us. In the office building of the housing association to whom his rent would be paid** \n\n&gt; ME: \"That would be fraud.\"\n\n&gt; AT: \"So! That's none of your business!\"\n\n&gt; ME: \"Unfortunately it is my business, and as a member of staff at [company] I have to report what you have said here today.\"\n\n&gt;AT: \"NO! THAT IS NOT YOUR JOB! YOUR JOB IS TO DO WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING OVER THERE!\" *gestures at computer on which I am reporting what he just told me*\n\n\nThankfully, at this point, his rent officer and neighbourhood officer came down to see him, and took him into an interview room. I called our security and asked them to keep an eye on them via CCTV, which turned out to be a good thing because within seconds of sitting down, he was kicking off. I could see on our little monitor that he was gesturing wildly and I could hear muffled shouting from him. He then stood up and walked over to the two officers, at which point our security came running through and into the room.\n\n\nSecurity asked him to leave via a second door on the other side of the room so that he did not pass either officer on his way out, which he refused to do. Everyone moved outside into the main reception area with the exception of one security officer and the tenant. The tenant began shouting and refusing again to leave via the second door, and eventually shoved the security officer out of the way and walked out, shouting:\n\n\n&gt;AT: \"I'm calling the police! You are all racist! Every one of you!\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"That's fine, we have the CCTV footage of you assaulting one of our staff members!\"\n\n\nHe stormed out, called the police who I assumed told him to stick the complaint up his rectum, and eventually left but not after coming back in to pay a fraction off his arrears.\n\n\nThat wasn't the end though. You see, he had showed up to our building in a newish BMW! This obviously raised our suspicions as he was adamant he couldn't afford to pay his rent. His rent officer did some digging and not only discovered that his insurance is void due to having no MOT, but also that he is illegally subletting his property after reviewing footage of someone else using his entry key every time it has been used. And he owns his own business, so is committing fraud by even claiming rent payments from the government in the first place which is why he did not want to disclose his income to us today.\n\n\nSo now, he is being reported to inland revenue, reported for driving with no MOT and insurance, and will likely lose the property and the car. All because he didn't fill in a form he probably could have lied on and just handed it in. \n\n\nI do love a happy ending. Or as we say in the UK, \"chat shit get banged\".",

I have cancelled my services with you, and I have pre-authorized payments (PAP) set up on the account. Today I got a notice saying my account has been sent to collections for $159.99, which I should not owe because my PAP should have fucking paid this!\n\nMe: I certainly am very sorry to hear this. I can definitely see that you do have PAP set up on the account, and I can confirm that your payment should have been taken by now. Plea-\n\nCx: Yeah I know! So like I said, I'm gonna get a lawyer, and I'm gonna make sure you guys pay for this!\n\nMe: Ma'am, I do understand your frustration with this, please allow me a 2-5 minute hold to find out why this has happened?\n\nCx: Yeah you fucking better find out, and fix it!\n\n[So I put the cx on hold, and I find out that there had been a trend/error with our PAP system lately where it hasn't been taking payments automatically for cancelled lines, and defaulting accounts to collections wrongfully. However her credit isn't affected yet as it hasn't reached 60 days yet, so we can still fix this and keep her credit record safe if she makes the payment.]\n\nMe: Hello ma'am, thank you for holding, proceed to explain the above to cx, I apologize for any inconvenience. This is definitely an error on our end, but we can fix this very easily. If you are able to make the payment with me now, I can remove the collections flag, and I can alert the collections agency that this account was sent in error. Also, your credit is not and will not be affected as long as this is cleared up before the balance reaches 60 days owing.\n\nCx: So you're telling me that your system failed to take my payment, and that you mistakenly sent me to collections because of an error with your system?!\n\nMe: Regrettably, yes ma'am, I am again so very sorry, but we can rectify this very easily if you just make the pay-\n\nCx: This is absolutely unacceptable! This is all your fault! My credit is ruined because of you, and now you're gonna pay for this! If you thought you were gonna pay before, you just wait until my lawyer hears about this!\n\nMe: Ma'am, as I've explained, we can fix this immediately if we just take the necessary steps. The payment was due December 8th, therefore all we need to do is take a payment that should already, and would have already been taken by your PAP, and then I can get it all cleared up.\n\nCx: No! Absolutely not! I am taking this to my lawyer and YOU are going to pay for this! This is not my fault and I will not pay for something that isn't my fault!\n\nMe: Ma'am, I never said this was your fault so please do not put words in my mouth, however the payment I am requesting is simply the same payment that would have been taken anyw- \n\nCx: I SAID NO!! You are going to pay this, and I am going to make sure your boss knows how rude and unhelpful you've been!! \n\nMe: [just before she hung up] Well ma'am, I have told you what I can do for you, [cx yelling legal threats at me over my talking to her] good luck and good evening. *disconnect*\n\nAn hour later, she called back and made a payment with another agent and filed a complaint against me for how rude and sarcastic I was.

        "text": "Hello TFCC! Same old same old LTL--FTP, as for introductions, I am just getting into the swing of my new position as a National Quality Assurance Specialist for my call center. I decided it was time to share some of my experiences as a NQAS to break it up a little bit here and introduce some agent initiated shenanigans.\n\n\nAs I am fairly fresh off the floor I still empathize a lot with the agents whose calls I am tasked with evaluating and luckily, my call centers' QA system is much fairer than just scores and numbers. Generally, our evaluations focus on trending certain call types and outcomes and how they measure against certain agent metrics (yes the dreaded M-word :( ) to use for further training and developing better support.\n\n\nOn this particular project, we were looking into Agents who had a higher hold time compared to other agents at their level/centers company-wide. As expected, we got a good grab bag of trainers with new agents attempting their first calls, tech-support agents troubleshooting with software updates, and a couple people who we honestly could not figure out any good reason for placing customers on hold.\n\nThis little tale is about one of those latter agents.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Customer asks for an extension for a balance that is not even close to past due. Tenured agent twiddles thumbs for 13 minutes on a video recorded call, placing customer on hold a total of 7 times, before learning to read. Then masks incompetence by blaming tech issues and supervisor unavailability, and makes customer believe he personally was able to get her an additional two weeks extension on her account and basks in customer compliments.\n\n\nFor most of our call recorded on this particular project, we had the luxury of skipping through holds on most calls as usually nothing pertinent was said (mainly just customers making rude comments), so the handle time for this project went pretty quickly.  Unfortunately, sometimes our system \"treated\" us to full, unskippable, video recordings of the agent's screen to compliment the  audio clip of the session. Although you may think these video clips provided some hilarious perspectives of what agents are doing when no one is watching, so far my few have just been maddening clips of agents fumbling through calls and clicking every other option besides the correct resolution. [Similar to this situation but with none of the money and all of the \"Argh why\".](http://img2.rnkr-static.com/list_img_v2/3501/2243501/full/the-greatest-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-fails-ever-u2.jpg)\n\n\nC=Cust, Ag=Agent\n\n\n&gt;Ag: -*greeting, security disclosures*- How can I assist you today?\n\n&gt;C: My bill was due on the 23rd of November and I can't make it just yet...I need at least two days from today if possible...\n\n&gt;Ag: Sure! If you give me a brief two minutes I'll be glad to assist you!\n\n\n*The date of the call was November 25th, so she was just two days overdue, and we actually really long grace period before and late fees, or even interruption of services occurs. From the Agent's screen during the video call I could see this information pretty clearly on her first ledger page, the Agent, however, chose to pull up the detailed history page instead. Here you could also see that this customer had a stellar billing history and was in no danger of course of our disconnection date of **40 days past due**. Despite this glowing information on her account, the agent instead chose to continuously circle the grayed out \"apply an extension\" option on the account several times in what I can only assume was some sort of ritualistic dance to awaken the button. The agent picked up the call again just skimming the 2-minute hold max to check-in on the customer.*\n\n\n&gt;Ag: Mam, I am just letting you know that I am having some technical issues with the account but am working on getting that extension for you, I just need you to bear with me a few minutes more. I'm going to report the issue and see if I can get an override for you.\n\n&gt;C: That's not a problem, bless you and thank you for your time!\n\n\n*After the agent places the customer on hold again, he thankfully gives up on his shark-like circling of the extension button, and instead reached out through  our company's newly implemented agent chat support. Although it was still maddening to watch a tenured agent ask for help on a non-issue, internally I sighed in relief as surely they would set him straight and I could close the call. Just kidding. There was still 12 minutes left. This time, instead of attempting to click unclickable options, for the next 9 minutes at 42 seconds, I got to enjoy witnessing the agent type his query into the chat log...and never actually send the question. The agent dutifully checked in on the customer 4 more times during this time, of course peppering his requests for more time with system lag excuses and the inattentiveness of his supervisors as our unnaturally patient customer just continued thanking him for his hard work. For nearly 10 minutes, I could do naught but watch and bang my head on my desk quietly as he flitted from facebook and team chat until finally he appeared to attempt to try and send an update message to the chat support---and realized he never clicked the send arrow. Within 10 seconds of sending off his question, the chat support agents set him straight with a curt message telling him essentially to use his brain and read.*\n\n\n&gt;Ag: -*after retrieving the customer from her 7th hold*- Mam are you still with me?\n\n&gt;C: Yes I still am, I'm sorry though I will need to go soon to pick up my daughter...\n\n&gt;Ag: Completely understandable mam, and since you were waiting so long on the line, I asked my Supervisor to compensate by not just extending your due date until November 25th, but all the way up to December 9th. 2 Full weeks without any late charges or danger of interruption, and I will notate it so that no one can say otherwise.\n\n&gt;C: Oh my goodness, bless your heart! I appreciate this so much! I would speak with your supervisor but I really must go, but I'll leave you a survey, again, thank you!\n\n&gt;Ag: Of course, I am always willing to go above and beyond. Have a great day!\n\n\n",

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster to the sub. Formatting and stuff, yada yada. Fight me. Weeeee! This didn’t happen to me but I was present when it happened, so that counts right?\n\nAnyway, some background. I worked in a call center as a delivery dispatcher for a big home improvement company. I have my fair share of shitty calls but those are for another day. We have different tiers of agents. Base agents, who take customer phone calls about their deliveries; a special team of agents (we call them the “team”) who take phone calls from other agents about issues with deliveries from a specific warehouse (I now work at that warehouse); specialists, who are off the phone and only work on customer/store emails; and finally our “supervisors” who take escalations. I was a floating base, team, and specialist so I dealt with a mix of different things. Many of my friends were specialists and several were on the “team”. \n\nWe have an island of cubicles and I usually ended up being alone on my row most nights. This particular night, I was bored and had finished my specialist work so I drifted over to another row to waste time with two friends. One friend, I’ll call her Lauren, was part of the team so she was taking calls. She also had an agent from another department sitting with her and listening to her calls for “cross training”. This guy is hooked to her phone using a splitter. This allows him to hear the person on the other line as well as Lauren. He’s sitting behind her, I’m standing next to him, and behind my other friend, Aaron.\n\nLauren takes a call from an agent who has a customer conferenced in.\nLauren: Delivery, this is Lauren. How may I assist you?\n\nDumbAgent: Hi Lauren, this is DumbAgent. I have SuperCustomer on the line with us. She’s having issues with the warehouse and her delivery. SC, please explain your issue.\n\nSC: Hi Lauren! So I was scheduled for delivery today and-\n\nDA: Warehouse told her it wasn’t coming today because it was too far away. THEN they call her and told her it was coming but it’s 9PM so we’re trying to find out if it’s still coming and SC is very upset and I want to compensate her so you need to do that to so call the warehouse NOW!\n\n(Actual run on sentence, DA did not take a single breath the entire thing…)\n\nLauren: Ok… SC, can I have your info?\n\nDA: Yeah, her order number is XXXXXXXXX, phone number is XXXXXXXXXX!\n\nLauren: I was asking SC…. But ok. Thanks.\n\n(pleasantries here, just general ‘How’s the weather?’ ‘ever kill a man?’ type convo)\n\nLauren finds out deliveries are done for the day, explains to SC and DA. DA freaks out.\n\nDA: THAT’S UNACCEPTABLE (I could literally hear this chick through Lauren's headset) THIS CUSTOMER NEEDS HER STUFF NOW. CALL WAREHOUSE BACK AND MAKE THEM TAKE IT OUT. NOW!!!\n\nLauren: I can’t, I’m sorry. SC, I can provide compensation for the inconvenience and we can reschedule for another day.\nSC: That’s fine, I don’t need compensation. I’m not in a rush-\n\nDA: Lauren THIS DELIVERY IS HAPPENING TODAY, I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO!\n\nIf you’ve ever worked in a call center, I’m sure you’ve hit the mute button and muttered something foul to the person on the other end of the phone. Well, Lauren was becoming extremely frustrated with DA and decided to release her frustrations. She reaches out to the mute, seemingly presses it, folds her hand in her lap, and growls.\n\nLauren: I mean, how FUCKING STUPID can you be? Jesus Christ!\n\nDA: Excuse me?\n\nSC: [dying of laughter]\n\nDA: I uhh…thank you. Bye. (call ends)\n\nLauren: *sputtering* w…what…what?\n\nMe, Aaron, and guy: [rolling on floor with laughter]\n\nLauren gets up and walks away for a few. She went and told our manager what had happened and he pulled the call. I walked up to him as he’s listening to it and you could see tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. Later, we found out SC actually called back in and complimented Lauren on how well she handled the call. She did get a write up for it but she laughed it off. She still brings it up from time to time and we always have a good laugh about it.\n\nTL;DR: friend doesn’t hit mute, says wirty dords while on phone with customer. Hilarity ensued.\n",

Here it is! ~~indignant 1-800 number here~~\"\n\nSo he just stays there on the line and I'm dumbfounded. But I call it. And I transfer him over. But... yeah why the fuck didn't he call them in the first place?",

I'm sorry for posting twice (I accidentally posted the letter \"W\" for the subject the line the first time I tried to write this)\n\nThis customer called in, wanting to go over his account. No problem. I verify all the stuff I gotta and then go into his actual account. I see his entire credit line of $20,000 has been all used. \n\nNow how our minimum monthly payment works is either 4% of your total balance or $15. Which ever is greater. \n\nThis customer's minimum monthly payment is $800. \n\nCustomer: I don't understand why my minimum monthly balance is so high! I could make a payment for a $40,000 car and have a payment lower than that! \n\nMe: Sir, when you do sign up for our credit card, it does state either 4% of your balance or $15 which ever is greater is due every month as minimum. \n\nCustomer: Oh can I pay $15?\n\nMe: 4% of your balance is greater than $15, sir.\n\nCustomer: Can you make it like 2%, then? \n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, these agreements are for all customers and are set by our company. \n\nThis guy really thought it would be a smart idea to use up all $20,000 of his credit line without checking how much his minimum monthly payment would be \n\nT L;D R: Don't use all of your $20,000 credit and expect your payment to be anything less of a few hundred dollars.\n\nP.S. apologies for any formatting errors on this.

The company of the campaign I'm in is one of Canada's largest home improvement companies. \n\nSo my dept. works in appliance delivery support, so like say if there was a problem with your appliance delivery like where is it or a follow up when the date will be or what time will it be delivered etc. you get the drill.\n\nI work the afternoon - night shift, we get inbound calls from customers, around the night we usually get calls from BC (British Columbia) or AB (Alberta) at this point in time. \n\nI get call from this customer (who we will name CX) and (I will be playing ME as me) this is how it went down as far I can remember. (pls do bear in mind that this is non verbatim but the conversation went kinda like this, he did say the stuff about be creative and call them even if they are closed)\n\n\n*gets call*\n\nME: Hi my name is ikabod197, can we please start with your order no.?\n\nCX: *gives order*\n\nME: *does confirmation of name* So what can I help you with sir?\n\nCX: I need to know my time window for the delivery tomorrow. They said I was supposed to get a call from 4-8 tonight but I never got the call.\n\nAt this point this guy is still chill still ok.\n\nME: Ok sir I can definitely help you with that. Do you mind if I put you on hold while I research this?\n\nCX: Ok\n\n*puts on hold*\n\n\n\nNow mind you we have 3 delivery companies who work for the company. And this person was located in BC. And usually when a BC customer pops up, it would be the shitty delivery company. It's kind of a joke here now that this delivery company is kind of crappy with their delivers and they do not do a lot of stuff right, like reply to our emails. And for the most part they did not give us a direct contact number, so we were usually left with emailing them and waiting for a reply and they'd reply the next day. Not even a system to check the order up on.\n\n\nME: Ok so hi sir at this point in time I would have to ask you to call us back tomorrow early mor-\n\nCX: No no no, I waited for you guys to call us for the time window. We were told by the store associate that we would get a call from you guys to tell us the time window to us. I can not wait a day. What's the time window?\n\nME: Sir, I'm sorry that the delivery company has not called you sir. I do need to tell you that it's not us at *company* who does the deliveries. It's the delivery company. I would have to ask you to-\n\nAt this point this guy goes crazy.\n\nCX: No no! I paid for this appliance, I need to know the delivery time window! Can't you do your job? I need to know my delivery time window for tomorrow! I paid for the delivery so I should know!\n\nME: Yes sir, but the problem is at this time we would have called them but they are closed for now. We can't tell you the time window without calling them.\n\nCX: Then that's not my problem is it!? Do your job and tell me the time window!\n\nME: Sir I can't-\n\nCX: Do your job and tell me the time window!\n\nAt this point in time he just said the same thing when I was going to tell him. The delivery company is closed, what does this guy want. \n\nME: Sir they are closed, I can't give you the info if they are closed. I can't tell you the time.\n\nCX: WELL THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM IS IT? Tell me the time window now and do your job!\n\nME: Well sir it's not us who does the deliveries and calls you, it's the delivery company who does that without them we would not know the time window sir.\n\nCX: WELL I DON'T CARE!! DO YOUR JOB AND TELL ME THE TIME WINDOW. BE CREATIVE. WITHOUT ME YOU WOULD HAVE NO JOB.\n\n\nYeahhh right cause without you I would be homeless.\n\n\nCX: DO YOUR JOB AND TELL ME THE TIME WINDOW. BE CREATIVE. \n\nME: Sir I am doing my job, I am already telling you right now that we don't-\n\nCX: DO YOUR JOB AND TELL ME THE TIME WINDOW! DO YOUR JOB AND TELL ME THE TIME WINDOW! TRANSFER ME TO A MANAGER WHO CAN TELL ME WHAT MY TIME WINDOW IS!\n\nME: Sir they will basically tell you the same thing if I transferred you to them I will just be wasting your time-\n\nCX: NO NO! I WANT MY TIME WINDOW NOW! I DON'T CARE JSUT TRANSFER ME TO THE MANAGER! YOU ARLEADY WASTED MY TIME\n\nME: But sir like-\n\n*at this point in time we are talking over each other now, more arguing about doing my job*\n\nCX: JUST GET ME MY TIME WINDOW! NOW! DO YOUR JOB!\n\nME: Sir do you want me to lie to you about your time window? I don't want to lie to you and just give you a time window because there IS no way for me to know the time window without calling them BUT THEY ARE CLOSED.\n\nCX: I DON'T CARE IF THEY ARE CLOSED. CALL THEM!! DO YOUR JOB AND BE CREATIVE. GET ME THAT TIME WINDOW. \n\n\nAt this point I'd had enough of Mr. Asshat and I asked my \"supervisor\" to take the call because he won't listen to me. So we have this \"escalation\" team called Dashboard, basically they are the same as us, but \"dummy managers/supervisors\".\n\nHe was fine with it, so I transferred him. So \"supervisor\" call went the same as mine apparently. But the cx probably just had to talk to a supervisor at that point so he went with it. \n\nTL;DR Cx wants time window, don't have system to find it out cause shitty company. Cx told me to be creative and do my job and call the delivery company even though they are closed. \n\nWhat a day ",

        "text": "So I work for a company that manufactures water heaters, answering customer warranty and tech support calls. These water heaters are sold at a nation wide home improvement store.\n\n**A bit of info first.**\n\nWe speak with store employees fairly frequently (usually involving the warranty-covered return of our product) and most of them are unsure how to handle a transaction and are just looking for help. Well we don't know how to process the transaction either, they need to call their store's support line. Maybe 10% of the store employees that call us are just rude. They told the customer something about our policies that is incorrect and the results can vary from the customer now has to do extra work to they just voided the warranty, either way the store employee looks bad and they get angry (it is our fault, not theirs of course). You would think someone that is at work would refrain from making rude comments or swearing at us, especially while standing at a customer service desk surrounded by customers; in reality the employees can be just as rude as the customers.\n\n**The call**\n\nSo first off, one of my co-workers messed up. She told the customer to return the water heater when the warranty had already expired. The customer was upset and the store was in a tough spot because this customer expected to get their money back. Another co-worker explained this to both the customer and the store employee, they didn't like the answer so they hung up, called back, and got to me\n\nThe call went on with me apologizing for the mistake and such would be handled internally however regardless of what was said, that agent is not authorized to make changes to the warranty, as it is expired we will not be covering it.\n\nIt escalated from there with the store employee yelling and swearing at me, finally saying things like \"I hope your holiday and your life sucks, asshole\" before hanging up. \n\n**me losing it in a professional manner** \n\nI am absolutely tired of being treated like crap by people that are supposed to be our business partners. Usually we just ignore it and bitch about callers after work but no, fuck that, this person is acting like this while at his place of work? anyone else would get fired for that. These store employees are often nastier than customers and when we don't give them what they want they ask for our supervisor / manager.\n\nI called the store back, and explained to the person that answered the phone that whoever I was speaking with was very rude and I wanted to speak with their manager. The person on the line says that ***was*** the manager I was just speaking with. I asked for the managers name and the store number.\n\nThe employee I was speaking with was much nicer though was clearly uncomfortable. He asked if I wanted to speak with the manager again.\n\n**No thanks, I'll just call corporate. you have a nice day**\n\nAnd so I did. Since it was a store manager that my complaint was about the District Manager is supposed to be calling me tomorrow to get a full account of what happened before speaking with this store manager. I have the call recording ready to send to them\n\n\nMy co-workers and I have always said that since they are often rude and then request our supervisors that we should do the same thing to them and it feels fucking good to actually do it and not just bullshit about it.\n\nI feel bad for that 2nd employee that answered the phone. He is required to provide their store number and manager's first name so he was just doing his job but I am certain that this store manager is going to hold a grudge against that employee.\n",

        "text": "I hinted at this in my first post on this subreddit, so here is the electrified fence story:\n\nOne call type that is common amongst all departments in my power company call center is outages and emergency calls. This way, even if one department is tied up it will reach someone quickly. Probably half of the outage calls I get aren't even outages to begin with, the customer just selected that because they know it gets to a human faster. While yes that is true, unless the department you're looking for happened to be the one that took your call, you're being put right back in the que again as we transfer you out. \n\nMost actual outage calls are simple. They range from a street light being out, to power being out in the customer's home/business. We ask some questions, we report it, and it gets sent to a dispatcher to take care of it from there. Occasionally though, you'll get the call from a local fire department, police department, emergency dispatcher, or other emergency service. They get their own pop up on our screen to let us know not to fuck up this call (paraphrasing the message). They usually just need us to come out and shut the power off to something to make a scene safe/safer to work in (ie a car accident that involves a power pole, a house fire, or construction mishaps)\n\nOne particular evening I got a call from a 911 dispatcher about a downed power line. Downed power lines aren't usually immediately dangerous but this one had landed on a metal fence. As it was described to me, the metal fence was arcing with electricity. Now most emergency dispatchers are either calm and cool or harassed and busy when we speak to them but this one was panicky and urgent. Evidence that she might be new came when she tried to explain where this downed power line was and could only give me a street name. After probing a bit, I wasn't getting far so I fired up google and did a search for that street in that city and was lucky that it was a short street. I picked a random address on the street and started getting my report filled out to get someone out there. That was when the dispatcher decided to let me know people were trapped in the home. Already serious call now turned into a life threatening call. Great. I send out the report, I make the necessary follow up calls for a life threatening incident and get right back on the phones having to de-escalate myself to take the next normal call type. At the end of all of it, the electrified fence call taught me one VERY important lesson... learn to deal without closure. I never found out what happened to the people in that home, I have no idea if the house burned down, and I have no idea how long it took for our guys to get out there. I can only hope I did my part well enough, fast enough, that it helped the right people save some lives.",

I can feel a stare from behind and Joey says\n\n&gt;\"Has anyone ever told you you have a very nice and well rounded ass?\"\n\nI had a very heavy box in my hands at that point, but I swear to god, I had superman-like abilities, standing up straight in NO TIME.\n\nI stammer in my words and reply\n\n&gt;\"Actually, it's a first time. Thank you?\"\n\nAnd he chuckles, saying\n\n&gt;\"You're adorable when you're shy like that.\"\n\nAnd I just lose my fucking shit at that point. I thank him for the compliments and get the fuck out of there, saying I had something else to do, but in reality, I had fuck all else to do. I'm not homophobic or anything, in fact, I'm bi as hell, but that creeped me the fuck out.\n\nThis isn't the end of the ballad of gay Joey, though. Oh nonono...\n\nWe had to go and bring all of our unused shit to the dump, a whole truck load of the shit.\n\nGuess who wanted to come along...\n\n\n\n\nOh yes, Joey... It was extremely awkward, naturally.\n\nOn the way there, he started talking about his new boyfriend, and I thought it would be the end of awkward flirts.\n\nHell no, that'd mean something good would happen to me once...\n\nNo, he started talking about how he was buff, but had no ass and how he wished he had an ass like mine.\n\nThe colleague who was driving the van began snickering, couldn't hold it back.\n\nAt this point I'm at the same point of \"I'm gonna stoop so fucking low and I'm not gonna give a fuck about it\" that I was in Part II and straight up say\n\n&gt;\"Well, that's too bad, keep dreamin' 'bout this booty, boy, 'cause this booty ain't neva gon' be yours.\"\n\nin the most gay sounding accent I could... Both Joey and the colleague were absolutely laughing their asses off and I could feel embarrassment sinking in like a big bottle of vodka downed on a lonely evening.\n\n&gt;\"We're just messing with you man!\"\n\nSaid Joey... So I began laughing too, acting as if I was in on it.\n\n&gt;\"I know, I do a pretty good gay guy accent, right? Hahaha!\"\n\nI say, trying to save my skin, hoping it worked.\n\nTo date, he still teases me about it and no one knows I currently have a boyfriend.\n\nGay Joey is alright, he's a cool guy, he just comes on stronger than a bus hitting you head-on.\n\nI blame this whole incident on myself... Mostly 'cause I have Aspergers. But still, they played a long game if it was really all just a joke.\n\nStill unsure if he was really hitting on me or not...",

        "text": "Anyone else spend a lot of their time at the ole call center actually taking calls while crying? I got pretty good at keeping the sound of weeping out of my voice, so most customers didn't notice. But occasionally a situation would arise while the customer was on hold, and I couldn't pull it together well enough in two minutes to keep the choking sound out of my voice and customers expressed concern.\n\nTwo times really stand out for me. Once I was in BIG trouble for my hold time. I was nervous and insecure and liked to \"double check\" things that I couldn't find in writing with my supervisors, to make sure I didn't tell people the wrong info. Okay, bad habit, I admit. Their solution was to seat me with another team, where the supervisor and team lead were both known for their intimidation and refusal to answer \"dumb\" questions. The supervisor was (honest to god) a big black body builder, and the lead was a big fat long haired greasy guy who I never saw smile. They told me in no uncertain terms that if I put someone on hold they would not help me unless it was a \"good\" question.\n\nI was already upset because I was in poor standing due to my hold times (this was early in my call center career, when I still had hope, and being fired was unthinkable). I didn't like being moved away from my friends/teammates into a new pod with co-workers I'd never met before, who knew I was there because I was on a shit list. I was intimated by the supervisor and the team lead. I think I was crying from the very beginning of the day, but if I wasn't, I definitely started when I put a customer on hold and asked a question (that I thought was valid), and the team lead answered me with a blank stare. It was hard not to panic knowing I couldn't get any help all day, I was pretty new to the job. I had tears streaming down my face the entire day but I kept it out of my voice (AFAIK).\n\nAnyway, the next morning my regular supervisor congratulated me on my improved hold time and I was allowed to move back to my regular pod. My hold time continued to be a problem for the rest of my time with the company, but I never had to go through that again.\n\nThe other incident was near the end of my time at the call center, and I see it as the \"beginning of the end.\" Up until this incident I really believed that I was *helping* people and that at the end of the day the company *cared* about it's customers.\n\nMy day was going well. A nice woman called in because she was confused about a charge on her bill. There was a 1 minute call to Transistria (or some other bizarre country I had never heard of before) and the charge amounted to about $0.64. She was very polite and said that she didn't even know Transistria was a place, let alone called there, but she would pay the charge if we could just explain why it was there. A quick review of her recent call history confirmed that she had never called an international number before and didn't use calling cards. \n\nAt the time we had had some known issues published on our intranet about customers getting erroneously billed for 1 or 2 minute calls to countries X, Y and Z. Our instructions were, if someone called asking why they were charged for a call to country X, Y or Z, to refund the charge. Transistria wasn't one of the countries listed, but this sounded like it could be a similar problem, just not yet a \"known issue.\"\n\nI asked the customer to hold so that I could explain the problem to my supervisor. This is a good example of what *I* considered a valid question but was actually, apparently, not okay. My manager looked at me with exasperation after I had finished explaining and said *well how else would it get on her bill, if she didn't call the number?* I was caught off guard and stuttered that there were known issues about charges for other countries showing up on people's bills. Manager rolled her eyes and says, *well, if you WANT to refund the charge, I guess you can. But it will be a goodwill charge and will go towards your monthly goodwill total.* (we could give out about $10 worth of goodwill credits a month, without getting crap for it, and I was notorious for going over.)\n\nI started crying (I know, I know, I was a cry baby, but this job pushed me to my very limit and it's hard to convey in writing just how mean and short my supervisor was about it) but my 2 minutes hold time were up, so I had to get back on the phone. Supervisors wouldn't take over a call unless a customer asked, no matter what. You could have a head wound, and unless they asked for a supervisor, you were stuck on the call.\n\nSo I unclick the hold button and realize that I can't speak. If I try to open my mouth, it will come out as a sob. I hit mute so I could take a breath without the customer hearing. At this point though the hold music has stopped and the customer is saying \"hello?\" So I choked back a \"Hi. I'm here.\" The customer immediately seemed uncomfortable and says \"are you okay?\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: Yes, I'm okay. Sorry. I have allergies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCust: Oh... Okay. (sounded very uncertain)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: I'm refunding the charge so your bill is now $50 instead of $50.64.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCust: Okay. Thank you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCust: That's all. Thank you. Have a good day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was really uncomfortable. I know the customer could tell something was wrong. It changed from a cheerful conversation, joking about \"where is Transistria?\" To a robot-voice with \"allergies\".\n\nTo understand how short/harsh my supervisor was with me that day, she actually came back later to apologize and to say she was out of line. Not because I was crying (believe me, everyone there was desensitized to crying), because she was having an unrelated bad day and didn't mean to take it out on me. I deeply appreciated the apology, but my (hard won) good spirits were lost and I hated my job just a little bit more every day.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I too have been in a horrible call center situation which made me want to get as far away as possible from this type of job. Now I work at a job that I love and will never go back. Anyways, here's my story.\n\nI had just left a job that was a decent job, but the manager was an ass. It was a retail job and I thought that going to a call center job would be interesting and I would get to use computers all day long to gain experience in the technology field. After quitting, I started working at a cable company call center (worst choice of my life). This company gives employees a lot of training time and I was still part of the training process and was till quite noobish. One day, every thing seemed pretty normal and I was taking call after call trying to sell products and assist customers. Then, my worst night mare I never thought I had before came to life.\n\nI answered the phone with the casual greeting, \"Hi, thank you for calling insert company here. My name is blank, how can I help you today?\" A male answered who didn't speak English very well. He explained that he wanted to see what the prices of said product were. After asking him to speak up a couple of times and trying to listen very carefully to what he was saying, I suddenly hear a woman scream at the top of her lungs in the background, \"MY WATER JUST BROKE!!!!\" I, being the very uncomfortable and youngish person I am, had learned that no matter what is going on in the background, you just keep going. I asked the man something else about what he was interested in and he started to explain some more about the product he wanted. Then, again, the woman screamed, \"TAKE ME TO THE F***ING HOSPITAL!!!!\" At that point, I stopped and froze. I had no idea what to say or do in this situation. The man kept talking about what he wants in his home! He kept going on and on about what he wanted to purchase from us. The woman in the background continued to yell and scream at him to take her to the hospital or she was going to burst out this baby right then and there. Again, I stayed frozen, unsure of what to say next.\n\nSuddenly, my supervisor yells across the large call center building, \"BLANK! BLANK! Tell that guy he needs to hang up and take his wife to the hospital and that you have to hang up on him!\" I immediately told the man that I was unable to assist him at this time and that he needs to take his wife to the hospital right now. He says in his foreign accent, \"Oh, okay thank you.\" He didn't yell, he wasn't freaking out, he was very calm and talked very quietly. \n\nAfterwards, my supervisor talked to me about what happened and he said he was already listening to my calls and just so happened to be listening while that was going on. I explained that I had no idea what to do or say to the guy. He said it was fine and that next time if something insane happens like that, just tell them you can't assist and you have to hang up. I was thinking, \"Next time?! I don't want to experience that again!\" Yea, I left that job for my new one not even a month after that happened. Couldn't handle it anymore.",

Like seriously, within 2 seconds I'd be able to determine if the call was a hassle or some idiot and I'd just hang up. On my screen I'd always write the last four numbers of their phone and if I saw the number pop up again I'd hang up straight away. What made it extra sweet was that sometimes people were waiting something like 20 minutes to get through. It was my own personal moral code - if someone was even slightly impolite I immediately hang up. It helped that I didn't really give a fuck about getting sacked. \n\nI'm just curious if anyone here had a similar code to help them survive this truly wretched job? ",

        "text": "I've been reading over the stories here lately which have really reminded me about my time in a big cell phone call center, which I quit in 2009. Best paying and worse job of my life, to date. This story stands out as my all time worst customer.\n\nA lady had just bought a new phone and wanted to move all of her contacts which were stored on her SIM card, over to the phone's memory. (For those who might be unfamiliar, back in the day, you could save your phone numbers to your SIM card and just put the old SIM card in the new phone, and you were ready to go. But you still might want to save the numbers on the phone memory, so you could set custom ringtones and stuff.)\n\nThe lady was frustrated right off the bat and seemed annoyed with me and her new phone, from the start of the call, so I was on my toes making sure I did gave her the right information immediately. The procedure for saving all your contacts to your phone was a little different for each handset, and I needed to walk her through it. I asked if I could put her on hold for a moment so I could go get one of the handsets she was using. At the time our call center had a booth with copies of the most popular phones, that you could just grab and take back to your desk with you to help customers with troubleshooting (VERY handy, they got rid of it). It really helped to have the actual phone in your hand for troubleshooting, so that if someone didn't know what \"settings\" was, you could actually say \"the icon that looks like a screwdriver, bottom right hand corner.\" For reference, this was just Nokia flip phone of some sort, nothing special.\n\nAnyway. I get back to my desk, phone in hand. Lady emphasizes that this is VERY important. She has HUNDREDS of contacts and if she loses them she will be VERY upset. I make sure to tell her that I understand, I'd hate to lose my contacts as well, I have her very same phone in my hand to make sure I explain the process to her correctly.\n\nOoookay. This is going to be fun. So I carefully walk her through opening her contacts list &gt; selecting all &gt; copying all to phone. Before we finish this process, I explain that she will see all of her contacts doubled in a moment, but not to worry, we are going to fix that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nCustomer: All of my contacts are doubled now! You just made me enter all my contacts TWICE!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: I understand, don't worry, that's just because there is a copy saved to both the phone and the SIM. We are about to remove all the numbers saved to the SIM, so they will just appear once again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nC: I have over 300 contacts, if I have to delete each of these duplicates by hand it will take me HOURS!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: Don't worry, we can remove all the duplicates at the same time. We're almost done, you'll be all set in a few more minutes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nC: You better know what you're doing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n*deep breath*\nOkay. All I needed to do was have her go into her SIM contacts and delete the numbers saved there. I helped her navigate back through settings, into her SIM contacts &gt; select all &gt; delete all. She stopped me here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nC: Wait, you want me to press delete all? Won't that delete all my contacts?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: Nope, these are just the contacts saved to your SIM. We already saved them all to your phone, so this will just delete the ones on your SIM, but the other copy, the ones on your phone's memory, will still be there. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nC: You better know what you're doing. I have over 300 contacts and if I lose them I will sue your company and make sure you're fired.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nM: I know it looks scary, but try to trust me, this is just deleting all the duplicates.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nC: Okay, I'm pressing it... ALL MY CONTACTS ARE GONE! WHAT DID YOU DO? SUPERVISOR. NOW! (and it was one of those \"nows\" that you can tell is being said through a clenched jaw)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI tried to interrupt to her, but honestly all the blood had drained out of my body and she just kept repeating\" SUPERVISOR. NOW.\" I was 20 something and spineless so all I could do was ask her to hold before I burst into tears and went looking for a supervisor. I was afraid she actually deleted all her contacts. Maybe she hadn't navigated correctly to the \"SIM contacts\" section, and just gone to her phone book? I was so certain I was giving her the right information. I explained the situation to the first supervisor who saw me (who stopped me to ask why I was crying) and she took over the call.\n\nI had to resume taking calls (yay! Call center life!) but later in the day the supervisor found me to tell me that the lady didn't delete all her contacts. She was confused when all the SIM contacts disappeared but they were still there, no longer duplicated, in her phone book. :\\ \n\n\n\n\n\n",

He had called in three times and had to wait a grand total of twenty-two minutes (gasp!) and was demanding to speak to someone. \n\nNow, in my position, I don't handle financial accounts at all, it's an entirely different department in an entirely different building, and I like it that way. I get yelled at enough without touching financial profiles. Which of course, I explained to Angsty McImpatientpants over here, not acceptable, I demand to speak to your supervisor. M'kay, I'll see if one's available, but they're just going to tell you the same thing. After turning to my right and asking the only TL not in a meeting and confirming that no, she won't take a call that has no business being in our department anyway, I check my phone for a minute and go back to the customer. Nope, no supervisors available, one can call you back in 1-2 business days, or I can e-mail the financial team, they can call you in 1-2 business days and actually be able to do something. Also unacceptable, want to speak to corporate. Sweet, whatever, have the president's fake e-mail that comes right back to us so we can throw your complaint in the trash and not talk to you again.\n\nTotal time elapsed: 17 minutes. Financial team's hold time as of his incoming call: 12 minutes. Had the dumbass decided to wait on hold, his issue could have been resolved in that time. \n\nNo sir, you are not the only person in the world to buy a \"luxury\" car, you own the ground level base model anyway, that doesn't entitle you to butler service, call back when you buy the supercar.",

BUT TODAY.\nI got my first QA score and it happened to be on one of my NOT so good leasing calls so I got upset because I know I'm better than that.

I paid last month with it. I set it up. \n\nMe: I do everything I can I look with her name, checked three times, resident code and everything. Even tried looking by her email. Nothing. \n\nMe: I'm sorry ma'am, I am not able to locate your information. It could be an issue with our system trying to communicate with the property. You'll need to contact your property manager for further assistance. I won't be able to sent you a confirmation number, but the one I gave you is the same one I read to you. \n\nDL: I DID SET UP AN EMAIL. SEND ME A CONFIRMATION NUMBER. \n\nMe: I am unable to locate any email associated with your account ma'am. Or you account period. I will have to advise you speak with your onsite manager for additional assistance. \n\nDL: *scoffs* this is ridiculous. It is there. You're not looking hard enough. How about you try looking harder?\n\nMe: ma'am I do apologize, it looks as if the email was not registered. Even if it was, I could not send a confirmation email of this recent payment since it has already been processed and the confirmation number I read to you has already been generated. \n\nDL: Put your supervisor on the line since you can't do it. I know my email is there. \n\nMe: sigh.... \"ma'am, I can send a message up to the onsite management to give you a call and that's it.\"\n\nDL: I know there is someone above you there. Get them on the line now. \n\nMe: okay ma'am. Please give me a few minutes. \n\nDL: hurry up. I don't have a lot of time. \n\nI placed her on hold and asked my colleague across the walkway who our team lead was on duty since our department team lead was our.

She took my headset and answered the call. \n\nTL: \"this is team lead, how can I help?\"\n\nI didn't hear what was said other than that the team lead on duty said but evidently the way I explained to the lady was to confusing for her to understand. She was nice and full of flowers with her. I think she just wanted me to get in trouble. \n\nI got upset but the team lead was like \"yeah we will get those types of people. Don't sweat it. You did nothing wrong. \"\n\nYeah I may not have but I just feel like when I'm trying to push and show dedication and hard work, someone asking to speak to a supervisor on my end take some like two steps back.\n\n*shrug*.

It can sound extremely fake, but the customers are stupid enough to not realize. I look at it as if I'm playing Skyrim or something and raising my speechcraft. \n\nThe worst part isn't even the fake expectations, it's primarily with their requests and questions.

I offered to walk him through how to block the number and to change his mobile number. He wasn't having it. I said if he was fearing for his life to contact the police. He said he did and they told him to call us. He threatened to sue us and then hung up. Like I don't understand how ridiculous the people I talk to on a daily basis are. Do they not hear themselves?\n\nSometimes the customer continues to repeat the same thing over and over even after I have clearly, \"I understand x, y, z that you said and I'm going to resolve a, b, c.\" Off course were expected to use \"strong ownership statements.\" Most often I just want to say, \"Dude, you don't have to repeat yourself like a child. I heard you the first ten times and I've already resolved everything.\" I hate when they say petty things like, \"My phone screen is cracked and I'm so upset\" and then continue with the woe is me statements. Even though they are talking to me on the phone and it's working. I then \"empathize\" with something fake as expected like \"Oh my goodness, I can't imagine if my phone was broken, I would be devastated.\" And they are usually like, \"See you get it. It is so terrible\" and they continue with woe is me. I don't understand how they are so enthralled in their own little world and think such a small minute thing is terrible and we need to credit their service or send them out a free phone. I just want to be like, \"You do realize people are shot on the streets, people have no food in their fridge, etc and your biggest concern is you're going to cut yourself on your phone screen and then sue us?\" \n\nWhy are they so stupid? What experiences have you had that just makes you want to snap?",

This is at the time when I see that he is about 28 says away from being able to. I explain that to him and tell him we can order/hold any phone he wants. Then he demands that I change the date since he was told on the phone with customer service that he could do an upgrade early. So the conversation I have with my back end reps goes as following\n\nRep: yea we've had this conversation with him 5 times apparently and we tell him the same thing every time. We told He's not allowed to yet.\n\nSo now I'm tasked with telling him that he's been told multiple times \"no\" and he's still trying and I have to say no as well. Then he proceeds to start yelling at me for being useless. Leaves the store saying it's absolutely ridiculous that he's being \"punished\" for having to follow his legally binding contract that he signed.",

        "text": "Hello TFCC!\n\nAfter five and a half long, arduous years, I'm out! I spent much of the time in my call center as a Supervisor, 5 of the years being spent in some flavor of management. And it was awful. I hated everything, everyone, I was just very hateful. Wish me luck! I have a new job starting in January, I'm taking some time off to decompress. You'll all survive, somehow. If I did, anyone can.\n\nIf you're interested about the backstory, read below-it's...not pleasant, to say the least.\n\nI had a fairly serious family emergency a few months ago, which required I take a leave of absence. They fought it. A lot. My mom also worked with me at the same center as an agent, and they fought it for her too. I had a couple great people back me up and \"fight the power\", but after 5 1/2 years of hardly ever calling in...and them fighting it the one time I truly needed to not be at work, I was looking for an out. I eventually got my leave of absence and I did end up going back afterwards.\n\nMy center took calls for a lot of different clients, which my center staunchly refused to train me on the majority of. I'd asked for training numerous times, but they wouldn't ever put me into training classes for whatever reason. Not having system accesses for a lot of these clients was rough, because around 75% of the time I was the only supervisor available. I was the only second shift supervisor they had, so as soon as the first shift left I was alone. Third shift came in right as I was clocking out. I got about two hours on a good day with another person I could ask for help on the things I had no training for. \n\nI came back from my leave of absence and I pretty much immediately get a call for a supervisor call. They had me come back on a Sunday, and for whatever reason, when someone goes on a leave, they disable literally all of your access to your PC, email, systems...everything. I was lucky I could sign into my phone properly, everything else I was locked out of. So I tell the agent this, that I'm locked out of everything so I have literally no way of properly assisting the customer, but we were working on getting my access back so if he could stall for a bit until I could at least get in to send an email, I'd really appreciate it. The customer eventually requested a call back instead, which I was happy about-whatever, they can be called back in a bit after I can tell them I'm sorry they're unhappy but I have no idea what I can do for them because I don't know what the fuck this company you're calling does-which turns into another call back anyway for a \"more qualified individual\" to respond to. BASICALLY it's just a lot of bullshit. \n\nThis agent opted to tell my direct supervisor that I was refusing to help and whatnot. I got written up for work avoiding, even after I explained that they locked me out of everything and all I needed was a couple minutes stalling so I could log in and send an email to the right person. And that I'd just gotten back from a leave of absence for an exceptionally valid reason. Nope, not having it. I \"should have taken the call and told them someone else would be calling them back and set up the call back [myself]\", to which I asked how the hell I was to do that when I couldn't even clock in that day because my access to everything was revoked. They had no answer for me, and because our policy was strictly not to take calls at agents' desks and instead have to take them at our own for some privacy reason or whatever, I was fucked either way. The write up still stood.\n\nOf course that just fueled my fire to try to leave. \n\nThey kept giving me problems afterwards for things too, ranging from I was \"engaging the agents too much\" (which is code for I actually talked to them about things and they liked talking to me and I didn't treat them like numbers) to \"we need you to cover all these extra shifts because we won't hire another second shift supervisor and we need coverage, sorry if you wanted a day off!\" (I fought that). \n\nThen a few weeks ago, someone vomited all over the hallway and I was informed of it by an agent-who told the 4 other members of management that were there as well. We didn't have supplies to clean it up besides a few paper towels from the restroom..and the hallway is carpet. We also did not have non latex gloves to do this with, and I have a mild latex allergy-but I still need to avoid it. Nobody wants a weeping rash and stuff-it's gross. One of the other members of management that was informed of this told me to break into a supply closet with a credit card-I told him no because that's even worse than not being able to clean this up. Ultimately it got cleaned up by someone who didn't have a latex issue as best as they were able to do. Emails were sent to the proper departments being like \"yo we need supplies for this kinda thing-it's cold and flu season\". \n\nThe one who told me to break in went to my direct supervisor and said I was avoiding cleaning it up because I was too involved with my own business and couldn't be assed to do it. I told her the situation and she essentially told me that because I didn't suffer through it due to my allergy and the lack of supplies, I was ultimately losing my job. \n\nThere's a whole myriad of things they've done to people before, I'm certainly not the only person who's ever had a problem this way. So I made them fire me.\n\nUnemployment thinks it's hilarious and my mom's lawyer thinks we could have a case-but I don't know if I want to fight it anymore. I just wanted out. \n\nAnd I am! I'm free! I have a month to myself and then I get to be the arts and crafts supervisor/mentor for a mental health/medical rehabilitation facility!\n\nTL;DR: Call center was shady, made 'em fire me-lost my job, now I get to do art and get paid for it.\n\nGood luck everyone-I know your jobs suck and I'll never be a dick to anyone on the phone (unwarranted-of course), but if I made it-you can too. Just keep looking for a way out once you know you need to leave, you'll feel so much better.",

        "text": "I'll try to keep this brief, but like you all I was working on the phones and basically hated my job. Ever since I entered the work force I always was in call centers. Unfortunately where I live there isn't much outside of retail and minimum wage, and finding more higher end jobs can be scarce, but there seems to be an overabundance of call centers.\n\nI've been working in call centers for about 8 years, just as your typical phone rep. I first started off working inbound/outbound calls for a mortgage company and then found a job at one of the major evil phone carriers (Cough, rhymes with Horizon). \n\nI absolutely hated everything about the job. I hated the absolute self indulged, degenerate, abusive piece of shit customers. The corporate policies and extreme micro managing from management, the constant pressure put onto you for stats, and how absolutely NOTHING ever seemed to be good enough. However, they somehow always kept you in by giving you pretty decent wages and general raises, and sometimes opportunities would arise for getting positions off the phones, but it always seemed like an impossible task no matter how qualified you are. \n\nI wanted off the phones so bad, you had no idea. It was the elusive thing in my life that always seemed to dodge me for the longest time. Outside of my life things are pretty good for the most part, I just hated my job. It made me depressed and I completed dreaded going to work everyday. During my 6 year tenure with *Cough* Horizon *Cough* I did 2 rounds of short term disability for stress, and was on FMLA for stress and anxiety. \n\nI don't know how people like us put up for the crap so long. Maybe we don't want to deal with finding another job, or are content with the pay and just put up with it?\n\nI wanted out. I was thirsty for it. I craved it, I wanted to be off the phones so badly, just the thought of coming into a job and not having to chain yourself to a desk and wear a headset was absolute bliss to me, and I was going to do it.\n\nI started going on indeed, and I worked extremely hard at updating my resume and making it look the best I possibly could. I went to school for IT so I have a good technical background, yet it was so hard to land IT jobs and especially jobs that require no phone work. Each night after work I would spend hours just sweeping indeed, going in every corner of the website looking for places to apply to. \n\nApplying to jobs were annoying, you had to make accounts, submit resumes and fill out tons of forms of information, but I basically made it my hobby for the next several months. I would put on music and just apply to jobs. Even if it was jobs I felt I wasn't qualified for, I still did it. The worst they could say was no right?\n\nI would get bites here and there, and some phone interviews, I had some pretty nice jobs where I had interviews. I would use sick/personal time or alter my shift just to go to the interviews and do them. It made things very difficult but I was willing to go through with it. \n\nFinally, after about 6 months of searching and carefully choosing, I managed to land a job as an exchange administrator at a IT company. I get to drive to work every single day and come into the office and not have to wear a headset. I get to work on various applications and communication through e-mails and ticketing systems, in a business professional corporate environment. The clients we work with are corporate employees, so it's not a bunch of degenerate foul mouth everyday customers or users. I've been doing this for about a year now and my mental health has completely turned around.\n\nNot every job is perfect, after all, a job is a job. But, I can safely say that all my work related stress is completely gone. I am completely content going to work, and I'm content being at work. My managers are great, co-workers are pleasant to be around. I work in a nice quiet office environment with minimal distractions, it's quite the opposite compared to the hell I was stuck in before.\n\nIf you guys are looking to get out, all my advice to you is just keep looking. Keep pounding away at job search sites, update your resume, find something else you are good at. Even if it means a small pay cut... restoring my mental health and sanity is far worth it. My job is now the least of my worries in life and I can focus on other tasks and issues in my life rather then some bullshit call center job.\n\nNever will ever work at a call center again. I am free... if I can do it, you can too. ",

        "text": "I've been a long time reader of this subreddit since starting my first IT and call center job in 2014. I've been working for one of the most well-known and morally objectionable corporate IT MSPs in America (if not the world). For almost three years, I've been fighting to find a way off of the service desk, where I do nothing but fix banal computer \"problems\" for borderline-retarded people who are afraid of technology and have no common sense. I absolutely hate answering calls and fixing the same 5 problems over and over again, day in and day out, but that's all my job has been. Oppressive management, unresponsive HR, and conniving co-workers have made it impossible for any of our 2nd and 3rd shift employees to make any career advancements. There were lots of empty promises, lots of promotions given to our team's most incompetent and disruptive members, and plenty of disrespect to go around.\n\nMy reporting manager was once out of the office and unresponsive for an entire year. In our group of ~20 people, he sometimes doesn't even recognize his subordinates when passing them in the hallway, and once even had to read one of his long time employees' name tag when introducing him to upper management. He has always managed to find a way not to take blame for any of his poor decisions. He has incited disputes between members of our team on more than one occasion just so the problem would eventually \"work itself out,\" so to speak, and HR would not have to be involved. \n\nA co-worker who joined our department months after I did, repeatedly violated corporate policies, repeatedly broke client information security policies, has mishandled classified information on more than one occasion, and has done nothing but make baseless disparaging remarks about myself and my co-workers was recently promoted and became my boss' boss. Since being promoted the first time — and especially now on his second promotion — he has made it his M.O. to air out everyone's personal business in the open. He doesn't have the spine to say anything negative about anyone to their face, instead opting to shit talk his \"subordinates\" in emails which don't include the referenced party. He has no clue how computers work in enterprise infrastructure, and constantly makes up nonsense so that he sounds smart when someone asks him a simple question.\n\nJust last week while I was on vacation for Thanksgiving, another better position on another team which I had been promised multiple times over the past two years — a position which I was already being trained for and had already proven my knowledge and ability for — was given to the other most disliked, dishonest, and shady character in the office. It was snatched away from me right in front of my face, and given to someone who makes plenty of others in the building fear for their personal safety.\n\nSince starting at this company, I have gained 25 pounds and my blood pressure and heart rate have gone through the roof, thanks to the constant stress (and stress eating) and lack of physical activity. I have developed an anxiety disorder and started having panic attacks, and I've become a bit of a hypochondriac.\n\n--------\n\n...but yesterday, I finally received an offer letter from another company and handed in my two-weeks notice with gusto. I'm officially out.\n\nFor the next two weeks, I plan to scorch the earth as best as possible without getting fired in the process. I called out the handful of most blatant aggressors and policy offenders in my resignation notice by name, hoping against hope that someone at the corporate headquarters might take notice if only for a moment. I'm working diligently to find a way to bring some of my co-workers along with me so that they can get out of that toxic and disgusting environment.\n\n...but damn it feels good. I woke up yesterday feeling refreshed and something resembling happy for the first time in months. My blood pressure is down, my heart rate has already lowered, and the dull headache that haunted me on a daily basis has finally gone.\n\nAt my new job, I'll be answering some phones, but it's not my primary objective! I get the opportunity to work with a small team of [what already appear to be] intelligent and stand-up people who are willing to communicate and share knowledge with one another. I've been promised the opportunity to learn any applicable technologies and skills that I'm interested in, and there seems to be a good potential for advancement. It's looking to be a complete 180º departure from the situation I've been in for the last three years, and I'm so excited that I just had to share the news with you folks.\n\nHonestly, for a while there, I thought I was going to be stuck in this position for the rest of my life. I was coming to grips with the fact that I'd likely die at a young age from all of the stress-related illnesses I've been afflicted with lately because of the unhealthy lifestyle that I was forced into at this job. Maybe it doesn't mean much coming from an Internet stranger, but as someone who has seen so much corrupt and downright evil behavior — most of which can't be written about here — that I had almost give up hope on living: please don't give up, and don't let anyone sell you bullshit. I wish you all the best.\n\nToday is a good day for me, /r/talesfromcallcenters! I'm off to celebrate!",

        "text": "So this just happened. Backstory: I work in an insurance call center and we partner with another company to provide a type of policy the other company does not. This other company serves military veterans and their families. It just so happens that we insure events (weddings, birthday parties, etc.).\n\nBefore any event policy is purchased, there's a notice that we have to read that blatantly tells them that once they commit, the policies are **Non-Refundable**\n\nA customer hosting an event calls in and the conversation goes as follows:\n\n&gt;me: Thank you for calling [company] this is SmashinAsh how can I help you?\n\n&gt;C: Yeah I called last night regarding my policy. We were gonna have a holiday party on [date] but we canceled it. When I called last night the girl told me it was non-refundable and I wanted a manager to call me back. I haven't received a call yet. \n\n&gt;me: Ok sir, let me pull up your policy and check on that for you.\n\nI get all of his policy information and ask to place him on hold so I can see if a supervisor is available. I talked to the supervisor who the policy was sent to and he said that he never called the guy because our rep didn't submit a formal follow up, just emailed him to see if we could do anything, which we couldn't. He offered to take the call but I just told him I'll send the customer to him if it gets out of hand. \n\n&gt;me: Thanks for holding sir. I spoke with our supervisor and confirmed that unfortunately we are not able to refund the policy.\n\n&gt;C: [in a snotty attitude] even for long time customers? this is the 4th year I've insured my event with you.\n\n&gt;me: I'm sorry, sir. The notice that was read to you when we quoted you states once the policy is purchased, it becomes non-refundable. \n\n&gt;C: This is just ridiculous. That's what the girl told me last night. I was promised a call back and no one called me back. This is completely unprofessional. Your supervisor wasn't even gentleman enough to follow up on his business. I'm going to call [company we partner with] to let them know what terrible service I got today. Why didn't I get a call back?\n\n&gt;me: I do apologize sir. There was a bit of a miscommunication. Our representative didn't request a formal follow up which is why there was no call-back but I do have him on standby if you would still like to speak with him.\n\n&gt;C: well there's really no point, is there? He's just going to tell me the same thing.\n\nYep.\n\n&gt;me: Again I do apologize for the miscommunication.\n\n&gt;C: whatever. I'm going to call them and in the future I'm going to look for other companies to insure my events. Goodbye. [click]\n\nI had to laugh internally at his little temper tantrum. I'm sorry that you think you are the exception to the rule but non-refundable means non-refundable. You were warned before you committed to the policy. Most of these veterans or their families are super nice, but every once in a while we get this special kind of snowflake who thinks that we need to kiss his ass and smile while doing it.",

For the record I love the company, my coworkers, and the job. \n\nThe one call type all reps do regardless of department is outage calls. This can be anything from a street light gone out to OH MY GOD THE LINES ARE FALLEN AND ELECTRIFYING THE METAL FENCE AND PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED! (but that's another story...). \n\nSince our company services Eastern coastline states, hurricane Matthew was really fun for us. While we got quite a few upset and frustrated people, most were within reasonable levels of irritated for someone who's power is out. During the first evening of storm mode I received a call from a lady who I'm assuming was black because she yelled at me for 30 minutes about how the white people on the other side of the neighborhood have power but the black people on her side don't have power. I spent as much time as I could explaining how it's not even possible for us to discriminate like that since  1. We don't keep track of customers skin color and 2. Hurricanes dont see color. She eventually hung up on me after going through the usual demands of asking for compensation for her lost food in the fridge (we don't do that) and demanding a discount on the bill (we bill based on usage, power is out? You're not using it so it it's free!) \n\nThe next day, still in storm mode, I got the mirror call of that lady. A self proclaimed white man who yelled at me about how we are restoring all the minorities power first because we are \"scared they will protest\" and went on a tirade of racism. The calls did end similarly because he also wanted us to pay him for his lost food and a discount on his bill. I really wish I could get those two callers to meet and be a fly on that wall as they discuss who Any Power is being racist to. \n\nEdit 1: while I didn't use the actual company name, I'm changing it anyway to be even less close to what it is.",

        "text": "I used to work in a call center where the bulk of our orders were placed over the phone. We would touch base with customers after their order was delivered to confirm they were satisfied with their product. They knew we would be calling at some point, so of course we were using numbers that the customers gave us to contact them at. People often gave their work number and had no problem with us calling, you know, since that's the number they gave us. \n\n\nUnfortunately that concept was wildly offensive to a receptionist (\"R\" from here on out) who picked up the phone at a doctor's office. The customer's file had no indication that he was a doctor or that this was his work number, but the name the receptionist gave matched, so it was the correct number. When the customer worked somewhere like a medical center, I didn't expect them to come to the phone, but I went through with asking if they are available or leaving a message anyways because that was my job.\n\nR: Dr ___'s office.\n\nMe: Hello, this is Me with Company. Is Dr. ____ available?\n\nR: E-excuse me? What do you want?\n\nMe: This is a personal call regarding an order he placed with us.\n\nR: (angrily) Are you aware this is a medical center and you are tying up the phone line? HOW DARE YOU!\n\nMe: I apologize for the inconvenience. This was the number he gave us to contact him at regarding his order with us. If he's not available we can try him another time or check if we have another number on file for him and try him there.\n\nR: What's your name?\n\nMe: (says and spells name)\n\nR: Give me your supervisor, now! This is ridiculous! I can't believe you're calling here! You have a lot of nerve! I want your supervisor!\n\nMe: Absolutely. No problem. I'm going to place you on a brief hold while I find him for you, okay? It may take a few minutes because he is currently not at his desk.\n\nR: FINE!\n\nI get up from my desk to hunt down one of my managers. None of them wants to deal with it. I go back to check in with R to let her know I'm not leaving her hanging and I'm still trying to get a manager on the line. It took at least 5 minutes for me to get anyone on the phone with her where she told my boss that I was heinously unprofessional and rude. He gave her the standard \"Thank you for letting us know. We will look into it\"\n\nI thought it was amazing how she was willing to spend all of that time \"tying up the phone line\" in order to tattle on me, but I was a villain for calling the number her boss gave us to reach him at. Seems like it would have been easier for her to ask us to DNC or simply say he was unavailable and then hang up. lol.",

Mobile and landline/home broadband accounts are completely seperate.\n\nWith less than 120 seconds left in my shift, a worried but very pleasant young woman called in asking to speak to a specific individual who we'll call Idiotic Roostergoblin. I told her it's not normally possible to speak to particular individuals but I would certainly see what I could do.\n\nAfter verification, I tried to piece together the story. Seems she had called in for an upgrade to her mobile, and Idiotic Roostergoblin talked her in to getting broadband as well. Unfortunately, she was still in contract with a different provider, and for some reason Idiotic Roostergoblin told her that if she was charged a huge early termination fee to call and ask for him specifically. Sure enough, she was charged a massive early cancellation fee. Also, Idiotic Roostergoblin had left no tickets, which makes sense because the account didn't exist at the time, and he has no access to broadband accounts. There was a single note, from when this woman had called about an hour prior and a TL told her that he would email Idiotic Roostergoblin and Idiotic Roostergoblin's TL, but obviously worried woman had not heard anything.\n\nSo this was a royal clusterfornicate. Idiotic Roostergoblin had made a promise about systems he had no access to, with no way of leaving notes indicating as such, and apparently expected it would all work out.\n\nEventually I just called the mobile department and spoke to an incredibly helpful agent who told me that, thank Haruhi, Idiotic Roostergoblin was still on duty, albeit not currently available. I ended the call by transferring worried woman over to the mobile department, where the other agent promised to keep her on the phone until Idiotic Roostergoblin was available and then send her over.\n\nPlease people, if you have to say \"Call back and ask for me specifically\", don't do it.",

Yesterday I got a call from the POA [power of attorney] stating that she had been calling for days [which shows in the call list] trying to help her mother with dementia and recent surgeries with her bill. Problem was by the time it got to me the woman had been disconnected and I understand retired teach salaries simply because my relatives are former teachers. I also understand dementia patients who are fixed on something because it's still something they know. \n\nThe POA stated that their direct deposit would come in today [mind you this call was yesterday] and she stated she would pay the whole balance and send in all the medical bills and what not to explain why the payments had been late. Considering the forecast stated that the temperatures would be in the 20s that night I put in a work order to get her power back on that same day with the promise of payment for today [which was done] and explained to the POA the following steps to make sure it never happens again as well as explaining about deposits and what not [since there was none on file when the services were disconnected.]\n\nI went from having a lady saying we're the worst company on the planet to saying I'm a guardian angel.\n\nI wouldn't go that far.

Around the holidays of is of course when we had the most people calling for billing accommodations. I would try my best to work something out but some people were not ok with anything except a forgiven bill. This call was the epitome of manipulation.\nCustomer (C) and me, she was calling about her policy cancellation notice because she was $750 past due:\n\n\n**Me**:  Good morning, C, the previous rep advised that you would like to speak with a supervisor regarding your bill. \n\n\n**C**: FUCK THAT BILL! I do NOT have the money and I'm NOT going to pay it. You need to waive it. \n\n\n**Me**: I am so sorry C, but it looks like you are 2 months behind on your policy payments and if you do not get caught up the policy will cancel.\n\n\n**C**: You are not allowed to cancel my policy!!!! I have to drive across the country for our Christmas vacation. I already told the kids we are going on vacation for one of their presents. I can't do that without car insurance! I told you, the only acceptable solution is for you to waive the bill. \n\n\n**Me**: I understand that is what you want, however I can not keep the policy from canceling if you do not make a payment for the past due amount and I can not just waive the money you owe. \n\n\n**C**: So then YOU are going to have to explain to my kids why there is no Christmas this year!\n\n\nBefore I could respond, she hands the phone to her child (who sounded about 6 or 7.\n\n\n**Kid**: Hi miss, why are you taking away Christmas?  Did I do something bad?\n\n\nI was caught so off guard I ask the kid if she can please put her mom back on the phone.\n\n\n**C**: SO, how much of the bill can you waive?\n\n\n**Me**: Ma'am, I can not waive your past due bill. If you do not pay it by X date, your policy will cancel.\n\n\n**C**: I guess you really are just soulless!! \n\n\nShe hung up the phone and I took my next screaming customer call. Later that day I checked back on the policy and she had called and made the payment in it's entirety through the automated system. The screaming I had mostly gotten numb to, but that pure manipulation still angers me to this day. \n\n(edited for formatting)",

        "text": "So this happened yesterday, a day in which I got called more names than usual.  Mostly because I work at a bank and the US holiday of Thanksgiving is coming up so people are using that as a way to guilt the bank into not charging them their due fees for their own screwups.  In a normal day I take around 90 calls.  In that day I might get cursed at 5-6 times.  Yesterday I took 75 calls and was cursed at around 12-15 times at least.  So I was in a bad mood. When this customer called in I was at about my limit and hadn't had a break in 3 hours.  We'll call him Good Ole Boy(GOB).  GOB was in his 60's and lived in a Southern State.  This is important to the story.\n\nMe: *standard greeting and verification* \n\nGOB: *standard answers*\n\nMe: Ok, my name is SirGuido, how can I help you Mr. GOB?\n\nGOB: I need to know why I got this here late fee on my account and you need to get rid of 'er.\n\nMe: Ok, well Mr. GOB, the reason you got the fee is that you made a deposit to the account at the ATM of a check and that deposit was made at 9pm.  When you deposit a check only the first $100 of that check is available on your account that business day before we can verify that check.  Also, our business processing day ends at 7pm.  So your deposit was not in any way available for the items billed yesterday.\n\nGOB: Say hwhat now? 9 o damn clock is still in the same day son.(Now I hate it when someone I don't know calls me son, its demeaning.)\n\nMe: Yes its in the same calendar day but not the same business day.  Our business day ends at 7pm.  \n\nGOB: Listen son, you must be damned dumb if you don't understand tahm.\n\nMe: (Irritated at being called dumb, it stems from growing up with a step dad who called me stupid at every opportunity despite the fact that I had a 3.5 GPA and took Honors classes) Sir, I can tell time just fine.  You're just not listening.  Yesterday's business day started on Monday at 7:01pm and ran through last night at 7pm.  Everything received in that time was then processed at midnight last night as always.  Your deposit, being done at 9pm last night, was done AFTER that business day.  Be that as it may, even if you had made it BEFORE 7pm, it still remains that you deposited a check and those funds still would not have been fully available.  Also, as to your other request, you have had 4 fees waived already this year and our maximum is 2, so you cannot receive any more fee waivers.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\nGOB: Now hold your britches there young man(twitch), someone needs to teach you how to do your jawb.  \n\nMe: Mr Gob, first of all I'm 38 years old.  Secondly I've been working in customer service for nearly 20 years, the majority of that being in the financial sector.  Every year I have to take a test to validate my knowledge in my job.  Every month I have calls that are monitored to validate my skill and knowledge at my job.  My income and livelihood are based on these things.  I take my income and livelihood very seriously as, I'm sure, do you.  I am well trained in my job.  \n\nGOB: *pauses for a moment* I'm sorry buddy, I seem to have struck a nerve now.  I didn't mean nuthin by it now.  \n\nMe: That's just fine sir, just trust that the people on the phone do indeed know their job quite well.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\nGOB: (meakly) No, that's just fine.  You have a great Thanksgiving now.\n\nMe: Thank you, you too sir.\n*click*\n\nYeah I shouldn't have gotten so snippy with him, and I might get marked down if its monitored, but an old guy learned a new trick.  He learned how to treat service people like human beings.\n",
