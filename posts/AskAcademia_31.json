I am a student who comes from an \"okayish\" financial background and  high interest in Physics - typically: Electrodynamics and Astrophysics (yeah, I know - two VERY different fields). I think I have a knack for research and I feel very excited in doing activities related to research. I have two options which I am looking forward to, starting my 3 years of Bachelors degree, but a bit confused as to what will really be better:\n\nPath 1) I choose Elektrotechnik which is possibly equivalent to EE in English-spoken countries, and then go for Space Engineering in TU Berlin, after having a one year gap in between to work and save a bit. I would have my EE Undergrad degree to financially depend on, for getting a job in the industry if something goes wrong in the process. Also, I think I can choose Undergrad research options too, but am not sure as to how many research opportunities are open for undergrad engineering students. Would really love your inputs on it. :)\n\nPath 2) I choose natural Physics, as in pure Physics BS. I go on to do it, even though it is arguably tougher as I have heard, but I have a love for Physics in general, so I guess I'd love it. And then, go on to do Masters and PhD in Astrophysics related fields, in which I'd be closer to the theoritical parts of Cosmology which excite me a lot. However, the career prospects of the whole academic path here is a bit shaky and it might end up being a financial risk, as compared to Engineering for Undergrads. But, however, research opportunities are rampant in Pure Sciences, as I have heard.\n\nNow, I am completing STK anyway in Winter Semester and Elektrotechnik in TU Berlin does not start until the next Winter Semester, so I have a semester free - in which I was possibly thinking of giving Physics a try for maybe a semester - as both summer and winter intakes are there for Physics in TU-B.\n\nSo what would you all suggest me? I'd like some honest advices and suggestions :))",

I am in the first year of my postdoctoral fellowship and over the next few months, I am preparing to apply for a research-oriented academic position (i.e., assistant professor, ideally in Ontario, Canada) and I have some questions about the process. \n\n1. How much of your program of research should be independent versus collaborative (e.g., 50-50, 60 (independent)-40)? Several projects in my 5-year research plan require collaborations with the departments of engineering and molecular science.\n2. In the submitted CV, what are the top three sections you list after your degree(s)?\n3. If I ever reach the interview portion, and I am asked what equipment I need, what is the ideal price limit? For example, I would need space for graduate students to work and computers, but I also need more expensive equipment like a gait mat and dynamometer. Do you purchase equipment through grants while prioritizing projects that don't need money (like systematic reviews and meta-analyses)?\n4. I hold a couple of internal grants as a principal investigator. I think it is important to show my program of research can be externally funded; however, most external grant agencies require the principal investigator hold an academic position (thus I would not qualify as a postdoc). Do you know of any Canadian external grant programs related to musculoskeletal health or knowledge translation that I could apply to as principal investigator? Does not holding an external grant as principal investigator diminish the strength of my application?",

Withdrawing from the program made sense to me because I was severely depressed, and I was not sure of what I wanted to do with my career after awhile. \n\nThis past September, my withdrawal was made final by the registrar. I felt relieved to be starting a new journey, but regret started to creep in after awhile. I started to tell myself that I made a mistake and I would regret this decision in a few years. The possibility of missed opportunities or limiting the doors that would be open to me took over. I completed a reinstatement for the grad program and was allowed back in. \n\nThe issue is that I am now regretting enrolling back into the program. I fear that I would be pigeonholing myself into cybersecurity. Some day's I love cyber and some days I don't. The feeling of not know what I want to do with my career is still there. \n\nWhen withdrawing from the program the first time, the form asked me why I was withdrawing and I said that I wanted focusing on my mental and financial health. I could withdraw from the program a second time, but I am worried sick what the registrar or the program director would think of me! This is for sure my anxiety speaking, but can the university take back my undergraduate degree if I don't complete the graduate program, or because I withdrew from the graduate program twice? \n\nAdvice, support, or words of encouragement for this matter are greatly appreciated.",

With a significant cut in our stipend, we are worried if we can even continue in the program. What can we do to negotiate with the school and advocate for ourselves?\n\nSorry for my long post here. We have been dealing with two separate issues with our program. The most pressing issue is that the school cut our department funding, and now our TA/RA appointments are capped at 25 % (about $900 stipend). For context, after the tuition waiver, we are responsible for about 600-700 dollars in school fees. This decision was not openly and timely communicated to us, and it seems abysmally unlikely for us to find TA/RA opportunities outside of our department / college. Most of us have student debt, medical debt or both. We are already half year into our rent contract, and now with an almost half cut in our stipend, we worry about how we are supposed to afford living and existing. \n\nThe other less pressing but equally frustrating thing is the program's inconsistent instruction. A lot of required classes were taught with no syllabus or plans, with some classes similar to an industry on-boarding orientation. They asked a recent master graduate (hired as a lecturer for undergrad instruction) who is not in our field to teach our research seminar this semester. This person does not understand what our program is and has made demanding schedules for students to tun in busy work that has nothing to do with their research projects. This person has also caused a lot of psychological harm to the students, particularly to an international student whose home country just went though a traumatic event. The instructor harshly denied the student's request to take a day off (a work day) to mourn, and has threatened this students on multiple occasions to report them to the program director for turning in a few assignments late. \n\nSince I joined the program, two students have already left and two are thinking of leaving. This is a really small program. I am the only one left in my cohort and the previous cohort also only had one left. The retention rate is really low but not public on the website. We have banded together to see if we can find a way to advocate for ourselves. We have reached out to our grad union, but we are not sure what other possible support that we can get (for both the academic and financial issues). Any suggestions or sharing of similar experiences is appreciated. Thank you very much.",

I do NOT refer to student solution manuals that solve merely some or half of the exercises, or solution manuals  restricted to instructors. \n\n1. Robert  Ash (1935-2015) touted in the [Preface](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~r-ash/RV/RVPreface.pdf) to [*Real Variables with Basic Metric Space Topology*](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~r-ash/RV.html),\n\n&gt;I rely especially on one of the most useful of all learning devices: the inclusion of detailed solutions to exercises. Solutions to problems are commonplace in elementary texts but quite rare (although equally valuable) at the upper division undergraduate and graduate level. This feature makes the \nbook suitable for independent study, and further widens the audience. \n\n2. David Patrick touts on page v, in *Introduction to Counting and Probability* (2005)\n\n&gt;However, \nif you are using this book on your own to learn independently, then you probably have a copy of the \nsolution book, in which case there are some very important things to keep in mind: \n&gt;\n&gt;1. Make sure that you make a serious attempt at the problem before looking at the solution. Don't \nuse the solution book as a crutch to avoid really thinking about a problem first. You should think \n*hard* about a problem before deciding to give up and look at the solution. \n&gt;\n&gt;2. **After you solve a problem, it's usually a good idea to read the solution, even if you think you know \nhow to solve the problem. The solution that's in the solution book might show you a quicker or \nmore concise way to solve the problem, or it might have a completely different solution method \nthat you might not have thought of. [emboldening mine]** \n&gt;\n&gt;3. If you have to look at the solution in order to solve a problem, make sure that you make a note of \nthat problem. Come back to it in a week or two to make sure that you are able to solve it on your \nown, without resorting to the solution.",

But as the eldest daughter and eldest granddaughter of my Asian family, expectations on me are generally high. I’m very worried about what I’m going to do after high school, and I don’t even know how to start off.\n\nSo with all this being said, I want to clear one thing on my mind: is a psychology degree worth it, or should I pursue something else?\n\nI had originally had plans of becoming a pediatric doctor or a nurse, but after a few months of difficult 11th grade classes, I just realized I wasn’t smart enough for that STEM stuff. That’s when a recent interest in psychology came to mind. If I can’t help people that way, then I could certainly assist those who are mentally troubled, right..?\n\nWell, apparently, I was wrong in that regards too. I’ve been told that psychology just isn’t in demand, and that even if I get a master’s degree, I wont find any useful work. What is expected in society right now is anything in the STEM field, and because I’m not cut out for it, I feel like I’m completely out of options. \n\nSo tell me. Is a degree in psychology worth it, or should I just give up, and open a cat café as a business major instead? \n\nAny advice is needed. Please.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ymivwc/i_need_advice_for_approaching_my_advisor_about/",
        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've created a throwaway account and will be keeping things vague for anonymity's sake, but I could really use some advice. Also, this is pretty long. \n\n**Background**:\n\nMy advisor is a relatively new assistant professor going into their second year of employment. I am one of their first full-time students. The other student that was in my year transferred to a different advisor at my institution. I want to handle this situation myself and not escalate to reporting to anybody in a position of power. \n\nA bit about my situation, I lost a person that I was particularly close to soon after entering the program I'm currently in. To put it lightly, this has impacted my motivation and my academic output. My advisor has commented on how I've handled this situation and my academic output. \n\n**Some recent comments they've made to me:**\n\n* That I'm not progressing as quickly as they expected.\n* They semi-frequently brings up a class day that I skipped in my first semester due to having a particularly rough day a month or so after my family member's death. They usually comment on:\n   * How I would know a technique I need if I hadn't missed the class.\n   * How I should have learned the technique that day in class. \n* That I'm not at the institution often enough to check on my work.  (I am here everyday of the week and usually check on my work once per day.)\n   * They have said that I need to treat my research like I care about it. \n* They expected a higher caliber of students from the program I'm in.\n\n**My dilemma**:\n\nI know that I could be a better student and focus more on my research. I've lost a lot of my motivation that I came into the program with and have recently hit a particularly rough patch. I also have trouble approaching them with my personal issues due to some of their past comments that I've felt have been dismissive. I'm also a rather passive person when it comes to advocating for myself. I know that their comments are coming from a place of concern, but their continued comments (particularly the ones about skipping that one class) really hurt me.\n\nI want to let them know that I appreciate their concern, but I'm aware of my shortcomings and them continually reminding me of my faults puts me in a spot where I doubt myself and my place in the program. I want to approach this without blaming them because I know they're concerned for me and I appreciate that. I also want to take responsibility for my absences and lack of motivation. However, my advisor doesn't like it when I apologize, so I'm not sure how to approach them without apologizing or making it seem like I'm blaming them for the situation.\n\nI respect and admire my advisor a lot, but I'm really struggling to keep my motivation up and continue with the program I'm in. I feel like I'm constantly disappointing them (and by extension myself). Any advice would be really appreciated! Also, sorry this got so long.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am a 3rd year US Ph.D student who recently qualified for candidacy back in mid-August and am ABD. Due to budget cuts at my university, my stipend was cut to a half time assistantship this academic year even though I was an instructor for an online 8-week Research Methods class and will teach another 8-week Research Methods class next semester. Even if I do not get an assistantship next academic year, that will not be an issue since all credits I need for the program will be waived by then and I only need an extension credit. I work weekends at a store to make up the extra income I otherwise lost compared to my first two years in the program. So far, this store job has been very manageable and they are considerate that I am a Ph.D student. Unfortunately, I already have a Master's with a thesis before I started this program so this part-time job is not exactly one I can use to build my CV/Vita at all. \n\nI recently applied to Adjunct Instructor positions available for the upcoming Spring 2023 semester and am hoping I hear back from them. However, I am having a lot of difficulty finding other positions related to my field (Experimental Psychology). Since my university cut their budget in a ton of other areas, I have not come across any job listings within my own university. My college is also in a rural area so the other areas where I could possibly work need to be upwards of 40 minutes away. That commute is alright with me so long as I am there upwards of twice a week at most.\n\nIn my opinion, my credentials are not super strong for the Adjunct Instructor positions. I have four academic years of research assistant experience, two years of teaching assistant experience, and half a semester of teaching experience (online). Many of these campuses are hiring in-person and there honestly is not anything else I have where I can edge out someone with just a Master's who has much more years (decade plus) of experience.\n\nWhat are other options for finding work related to my field right now?",

Any more and we have to retake the class even though I am passing the lecture portion. \n\nSum of it all:\n3 total checkoffs the semester. Only 1 can be unsuccessful. \n\nMy 1st and 3rd were unsuccessful. 3rd was a fault of my own, not practicing enough due to my health issues and work situation. HOWEVER, with the 1st checkoff (and the 2nd other students too had an issue with the inconsistent grading nature of it all) I have reviewed the handbook policy and it specifically states,\n\n“You will be recorded and two instructors will be present during your check-off. This is to ensure accuracy of the grading process and for learning purposes should remediation be necessary.” \n\nTHIS DID NOT TAKE PLACE. Only one adjunct was present for my checkoff not the actual professor. It makes sense that there were inconsistencies in the grading. \n\nA student made a big deal about the 2nd checkoff but I didn’t mind it any because I had passed that one. Finding out, those students that failed the 2nd checkoff are getting a retake and the unsuccessful is not counted against them. Even though they failed the 2nd and 3rd one, they are still able to stay in the program with TWO unsuccessful attempts because the 2nd she isn’t counting towards them. \n\nThis is UNFAIR. The professor states that she let them retake it because we only had a day to practice for that 2nd checkoff. Which is weird because as soon as the student blew up about that 2nd checkoff the next day she sent an email updated that policy to where it now says one prof or two can be present. \n\nHowever, she still never followed the policy for the 1st and 2nd checkoff and if those students can retake the 2nd checkoff I should be able to take the 1st because the handbook policy was violated during mine as well. \n\nAlso, I reached out to the professor about this and she was very rude to me. I owned up to failing the 3rd checkoff due to letting my work and health situation get in the way, but I shouldn’t have failed the first. The adjunct professor for the 1st didn’t give me points for verbalizing the bed was at a correct height because I didn’t physically do it. I didn’t move it because it was already at a comfortable height BUT I still verbalized and acknowledged it to the adjunct. In the rubric it didn’t say that part had to be done even if the bed was at a comfortable height. Those additional points caused me to fail. \n\nAnyways, the professor also said in the email with the Dean tagged in it, accusing me of not practicing or asking questions at all. I have some proof of this being wrong as I’ve taken some videos and pictures in lab of me engaging with of students and practicing. \nALSO the main thing that doesn’t line up with her accusation is, \n\nshe NEVER mentioned this in my midterm evaluation and I have proof of this that I will include in the appeal. \nActually in my evaluation that was done based off first two checkoffs, she states that overall in the class I DID practice evidence based practice and patient centered care which proves that she acknowledged me practicing in the lab and witnessed me perform patient centered care. She stated it in the midterm evaluation herself. I didn’t practice enough for the 3rd checkoff which would be correct but she accused me of doing that the entire semester to try and make it seem like I didn’t put forth the effort, which is wrong. And if she did feel that way, she never documented it in the evaluation at all which is her fault. I wasn’t aware she felt this way about me the entire semester because it wasn’t communicated. \n\nAnyways, I have screenshots of all this I’m including in my appeal BUT \n\nI wanted to see what you guys thing? Should I really be retaking this class or does this evidence truly work in my favor?\nI think it’s unfair other students are retaking the 2nd checkoff without penalty but she’s pushing me back a semester. I am passing my lecture portion and have proved enough that I do know the material. She is going based off my 3rd checkoff. But 2/3 of the semester until now, she wasn’t following that handbook policy for the checkoffs. Which I feel is grounds for appeal….\n\nLet me know what you guys think. Sorry if any of that is confusing, let me know if you need clarification.",

My duty hours are from 9 am to 5 pm. During this period, I have to be in this laboratory for report verification. It’s a very noisy place because of analyzers sound and technicians talking frequently ( so i can’t do intellectual work) Apart from this work, I’m also a member of IQAC committee where I’ve to dedicate some time ( 6-7 hours weekly). I also have to take lectures and exams.   \nNow about what I want: \n\nI am interested in an interdisciplinary research work involving medical science ( precision medicine) and computer science( AI).  As this is a unexplored topic, I’ve to read a lot (often I do this after my job hours in my home ). Infact I’m happy to devote extra time and energy into this. But the problem is that, as I’m completely engaged in the clinical laboratory, I can’t do the research work. So my question is how I can reach out to my director to convey my concerns politely and effectively? if I finish such work and publish good articles, it’s good for my university. Such work is not being done in many medical institutions in India. Actually during my job interview, I mentioned this reason for joining my current institution. I would love to hear your advice on this.",

        "text": "his came out to be longer than I expected, but help me out!\n\nI'm a bit confused and out of touch with reality, and this may seem bizarre to many of you, but please bear with me.\n\nI'm a doctoral candidate in social science in the USA, more than half way through my program at an R1. Being an international student from Asia, I had to work really hard to get into a decent program in the US. I was the first in my family, and highly respected/esteemed because of this (I came from a lower middle class family background in my home country). \n\n  \nAnyways, because it took me a long time to get here, I'm now 30, and waiting to be done with my program. I also had some pressure to find someone and get married (asian parents), and so I started dating here in my college town. I found someone who seemed to be pretty good on paper, master's degree, finance and accounting certifications, decent job that pays decent (six figure), treats me pretty well etc. We started dating casually but it got very serious and he ended up proposing me (he's also 7-8 years older than me) so he's in more hurry than me. So we got engaged pretty quickly, and if everything goes well, should get married next year. We get along pretty well too considering the cultural differences (he's American, I'm Asian/international student) \n\nEverything seems good on paper. However, since I grew up in a family that placed a lot of importance on education, and I was kind of the achiever in my family, I always had this dream to pursue a PhD, and not only do it myself, but also marry someone who is an academic/intellectual/scholar, and an idealized version of our \"life of the mind\", where we teach/publish/do research/professorship in exotic locations etc(Singapore, UAE, Europe etc.), read books together, attend conferences, seminars etc.\n\nHowever, my fiancé although is very supportive of my career and treats me nice, is NOT an academic at all, and nor is interested. He's more of a numbers guy (accounting/finance career) than a wordsmith or writer or bookworm. He also doesn't seem interested in ever pursuing a PhD or an academic career at all. Which means I might get summers off every year while he would be working.... and so how will we travel?\n\nSince most of my program was done remote due to Covid, I couldn't form a lot of friendships/relationships with other grad students. I still have quite a few grad student friends, but most of them are either in a relationship/married or gay. Not available for a romantic relationship. \n\nComing to my fiancé, he's a good person and I deeply cared about him. However, the difference in career choices seem a lot to me, and I fear that I might miss that part of a companionship/relationship(similar career). It keeps bothering me to the extent that I'm unsure if I should get married or start looking for someone else?\n\nAlso, just to clarify, an intellectual partner doesNOT mean that he should also be a professor/academic, but at least someone who preferably has been through grad school/PhD, and knows how research etc. works.... I understand professor jobs don't come easy, especially for a couple in the same location, and I'm flexible with pursuing academic or alt ac too, but at least someone who knows the grind, and works in research, policy, academia, higher ed etc.\n\nMy brain keeps nagging me an showing me the \"ideal\" picture of my life with an academic partner, whereas in reality, I have never dated another academic, and that few that I know, I didn't like romantically. I'm not sure if I should break off things with him over this, or should I get therapy/seek help? I guess I 've idealized the the academic life and life of the mind and I don't want to ruin something good just because of my idealism/fantasy.\n\nPlease suggest what should I do at this stage? What does your partner do? Are they also academic? Did it matter to you? Do you connect with each other intellectually/professionally?",

For the sake of argument, assume that I'm able to get into a program that is highly ranked enough for whatever career might follow the PhD.\n\nSome background: I studied a CS-adjacent field in undergrad, which helped me land my first job as a technical project manager at an applied R&amp;D firm. That job then helped me get hired into my current position as a software engineer in a machine learning lab at a university. I took the job with the intention of building up my credentials for eventually applying to machine learning PhD programs. As I've gained experience in this position (over the past \\~3 years) I've found that my interests are yet again shifting to another sub-field of CS (with a moderate amount of overlap with the ML world, but still very much a distinct sub-field).\n\nI'm now at a crossroads in my career (for reasons that I won't go into here, for the sake of brevity), and I feel that it's time for me to either commit to the PhD plan, or to start going down a different route.\n\nSome reasons I think a PhD would be a good fit:\n\n* I've very much enjoyed my time in the research world.\n* I'm highly motivated by doing things that haven't been done before.\n* I enjoy the process of communicating the results of my work (I like to think that I'm good at it, too).\n\nSome reasons that a PhD might not be a good choice:\n\n* I'm leaning away from academia as a career (this seems to be less of a deal-breaker in CS, but worth mentioning).\n* As much as I'm motivated by doing new things, I also have a hard time focusing on projects that aren't highly applied in nature.\n* I'm worried that I don't have the patience for it: from my short career history, you can see that my interests have changed multiple times, around once every three years.\n\nSome points neither in favor nor against:\n\n* I'm not overly burdened financially, and can afford to live on a student stipend for the duration of the PhD.\n* I'm OK with the (likely) possibility of getting a job after the PhD that is not directly related to my research (i.e. I wouldn't necessarily see this as a \"waste\").\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Could pursuing a PhD be a good choice for me?\n\nThanks in advance - any thoughts or advice is appreciated.",

Just now I've received word from the editor that he will not proceed unless I again do further revisions. **Given my situation, I'm wondering how to proceed: Do the third lot of revisions and hope for the best, or move on and submit to a different journal?**\n\nI'm nearing the end of my PhD, and and a major part of crossing the finish line depends on the acceptance of this journal article. My funding is running out, and although there's a good possibility of a little bit more to tide me over, nothing is guaranteed.\n\nWhen I initially submitted the article, it went through peer review and the thoughts were mixed. Reviewer 1 recommended acceptance with minor revisions and Reviewer 2 wanted major revisions before considering it further. Both reviews were positive about the future of the article. The editor seemed enthusiastic about the paper, and asked for the revisions before acceptance.\n\nI did the revisions, only for the editor to come back and say it was not good enough to be sent back for review. I was quite surprised by this, because the editor now brought up a number of issues neither he or the reviewers had previously raised. These weren't issues due to the revisions I made, but sudden new criticisms of the original paper. The editor now seemed less than enthusiastic about the \"fit\" of my research for the journal.\n\nAgain, did revisions. Again, it's come back with detailed criticisms for me to respond to if I wish to get it past the editor and proceed to another peer review. Again I get the impression that the editor is now less enthusiastic about my work than at the beginning of the process - and yet this editor has invested a lot of time and effort in giving me detailed feedback.\n\n**Considering the process and the time/funding pressure I'm under, what would you do?** I could absolutely address this editor's feedback, but I also wonder if I'm fighting a losing battle and missing the subtext, i.e. move on and submit elsewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I don't feel comfortable talking to the instructor of the class yet.\n\nI'm hoping to graduate this semester and then merge into my lab as the lead grad researcher in the Spring of 2019. I am taking statistics and genetics, and I was already having a difficult time with genetics before I got my blackboard grades uploaded last night for statistics - I am somehow failing all of the assignments I'm turning in. The ones I've gotten back are just slashed to pieces, with absolutely no feedback whatsoever. The thing is, these are homework problems from the book, where you use the book to find the answers to the problems... pretty straightforward. I took a much more difficult version of this stats class with a hardcore professor last semester, and I got a C-. Not enough to count for my core requirement so I had to take it again. There is no way I am legitimately failing this course based on my previous experience.\n\nOn top of it, this 'professor' mocks me and my likeness in class in the form of statistical \"examples\" and they are often borderline malicious in tone. Snarky, like Snape. He basically told me not to come to class after I swapped in from another stats class; that I could pass the class by just showing up to turn in homework and for exams and quizzes. I spoke with a friend who is also in the class, and she said all of his assignments etc. are based on the way he teaches it in class, with his own vocabulary and definitions. \n\nI'm speaking with my advisor, (he has been my first advisor as an undergrad for three years so I trust him, and he is also the president of the professor's union at the university), to see what he thinks I should do. \n\nAside from speak to this statistics instructor, does anyone have any other advice in this situation? I truly feel as if I'm being discriminated against, but I have no proof.\n\nThanks Reddit.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nI brought this to the attention of my advisor this morning before stats lecture. I can list off at least five instances where he has directly or indirectly mocked me in examples in class. I have no proof; its he said, she said. \n\nMy advisor immediately asked me if I wanted him to be involved with me and I said yes please, so the next few seconds later he was on the phone with the chair of the stats department setting up a meeting time. The asshat teaching the class is not faculty, only an instructor. I asked if there was anything I could get in trouble for (he said absolutely not), I asked what about ramifications I could possibly encounter from the instructor for bringing this to public attention (he said no, that would be retaliation and he would likely be fired for that), and I asked him if I was doing the right thing, to which he responded with a solid yes, and said that no student deserves to get bullied by their instructor.\n\nI've accepted that the first homework grades were my fault, btw.\n\nWe will see how this goes.",

        "text": "I'm at a \"top\" university and (mis)fortunate enough to sit in on lectures with huge names in the field (even Nobel prize winners and semi-famous people) but nearly all of these huge names are terrible teachers.  Seems weird to me that if you super get something you should be able to teach it, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The onus here seems to be on the students to figure out the material for themselves if a class isn't taught by a lecturer.  What gives?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: It seems the consensus is that teaching well is not incentivized as much as it could be at universities. To what degree as the current and future generation of professors do we have the responsibility to change/improve the situation? ",
