        "text": "I work for a patrol service in the Hollywood Hills/Encino Valley.  I float (choice, I get the coveted Fri/Sat off this way) from beat to beat.\n\nLast week, 10 mins before the end of my shift, Dispatch called me on a client call, advising of a 925 (suspicious person) near their house.  I get over there, seeing a man walking his dog.  Turned out to be the client's neighbor.  I sit in front of the house for about 5 mins, per protocol. \n\nAt the 4th minute mark, the neighbor knocks on my window &amp; says the client came out.  I inwardly groan, knowing this is going to take a while.  As I step out of the patrol vehicle, Karen comes marching over with all of her \"**LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER RIGHT NOW!!!**\" attitude, waving a phone in my face (I'm far sighted, need reading glasses to see up close &amp; it was raining that night.  I can't stand water spots on my glasses).  \"**GET HIM OUT OF MY BUSHES!\"**\n\nOkay, let's back up here a moment, Karen.  I'm missing a few details.  I tell her, \"I got a call about a suspicious per-\"  That was as far as I got, before the screams of the undead she called a voice interrupted me.  \"**I SAID GET HIM OUT OF MY BUSHES!\"** &amp; proceeds to wave a finger in the general direction of her bushes by the road.\n\nI pull out my flashlight, click it on &amp; turn it to the bushes, where I saw...\n\n…nothing.  No shadows recoiled, no ghosts flew out to be hit by proton streams, and no one jerked out &amp; took off.  \"Ma'am, there's no one there.\"  Oh, that initiated the battle cry of the Karen.  \"**HE WAS IN MY BUSHES, PEEPING IN AT ME!  I WANT YOU TO ARREST HIM!\"**  \n\nNow, a little context here:  the \"bushes\" in question were more like ivy growing on what was obviously a stone or brick wall.  For Springheel Peeping Jack/Jill to have peeped, (s)he'd either have to have Kryptonian X-Ray vision, jumped over 10 ft over the wall, or they were never there.  Either way, I saw no one there &amp; my powers to do anything ended at the property line. \n\nI tried again.  \"Ma'am.  No one is there.  If they *were* there, they left already.  The only 3 people I saw were you, your neighbor and his dog.\"  And this is where I made the next mistake:  I thought that was it.\n\nKaren proceeds to shove her phone 3\" from my nose &amp; somehow managed to **REEEEE** at a decibel that the dog was howling in.  \"**I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS FOOTAGE, FIND HIM &amp; ARREST HIM!\"**\n\n1:  No.  That's illegal.\n\n2:  *That's Illegal*.\n\n3:  **THAT'S** **ILLEGAL.**\n\n4:  It was past my shift end time &amp; did I mention it's illegal?\n\nI told Karen in my best \"Karen can pound sand\" voice, \"No.  I need my reading glasses to see it, &amp; I'm not pulling them out in this rain.  If he was here, he's gone.  My jurisdiction ends at your property line.  If you want him found and arrested, then I advise you call PD.\"  With that, I radioed Dispatch, gave my disposition and left.\n\nFinal mistake:  I thought that was it.  Nope!  About 2 minutes down Mulholland, Dispatch radios me, asking for a 10-21 (private call).  Pull over, call them up &amp; speak to an honestly pleasant operator...who had just had her eardrum blown by decibels heavy metal bands use at live shows.  Yup, Karen wanted to escalate.  Thankfully, Dispatch said they could set up an extra patrol for the night, but that was it.  I said I'd advise Night shift &amp; I was headed back to shift change.  \n\nGot there, advised Night shift what happened, gave my passdown &amp; left.",

        "text": "So here is my big story from ~1 year in security. This happened probably 4+ months ago at this point, so it wasn't that long into my current endeavors. \n\nHere's a little backstory just to set up the situation. The school is only open M-F, but security is 24/7. On the week days, we're on the school radio channel with the client, the parking guards (lucky guys are in-house), and the local sheriff's office has a college unit where they'll have a few deputies posted at the school, on radio with us as well. The deputies are only there M-F, not on the weekends when the school is closed. The school is locked on the weekends, and when the campus is closed. This being a weekend, the campus was closed and the doors were locked.\n\nThe contract for this site calls to have at least 4 officers on duty at all times. I was the only officer available to work post, so it was just me doing normal post activities. Luckily, there were 2 other guards and my supervisor there for a parking event, however, they were all in their own area doing their own thing, taking money. Keep this in mind, because on any other given weekend, they could have just as easily not been there for a parking event, and it'd have just been me by myself. The site spans 9 downtown city blocks, so all the other officers in this story were multiple blocks away, on foot. \n\nSo I was walking back to my post desk on a Saturday night, around 7pm. As I started walking up the stairs, I noticed a male and a female sitting on the bench outside. I was walking into the building up a ramp behind them. As I'm walking up the ramp, the male comes up to me, barefoot, walking through a little garden area. Immediately that aroused my suspicion, as he said \"Hey, what's your name?\"\n\nNow me being the complete nincompoop I am, I replied. He then asked me, \"Why?\" An odd question, I replied \"Why's what?\". He then asked me, \"Do you even know why that's your name?\" I gave a half reply since I had never been asked that question before. I must note, at this point, he did not seem off in any way, other than walking barefoot through the garden. I kinda thought he was just an energetic guy who just wanted to talk, since there are many people like that here. At that point, he turned to the female sitting on the bench and said \"You see that? This guy doesn't even know why his name is what it is.\" At this point I began walking further up the ramp and towards the door. A few steps further, almost at the front door he yells to me from below the steps (steps and a ramp to the door) \"I'm gonna fucking kill you, you know.\" At that point I was like, fuck, and started fumbling for my keys. I got the keys in the door, swooped inside, turned around, and pulled the door shut behind me so he couldn't pull it back open. As I was doing all of that, he was running up the steps to actually punch me. \n\nI am not joking you that the second i closed the door and it latched, his fist connected with the glass HARD. If I was any at all bit slower, he would have clocked the back of my head, forward into the glass. I gave him a smirk \"really?\" face then watched him walk away and alerted my supervisor over the radio, who called 911. In the minutes afterward, he physically assaulted my supervisor, who was walking to my location, and slapped a few other bystanders on the street. He was arrested probably 10 minutes later for two \"threatening\" counts, and was out of jail the next day.\n\nIt's moments like those that make me wish we were armed. We all talked about how we need some mace, a taser, anything other than a big \"fuck you\" flashlight, especially considering we're at a school in the middle of a downtown area. \n\nAfter that though, I've had no more notable instances. I'm ready to acquire my next story but at the same time, I really don't want to have to.\n\nThanks for listening!",

        "text": "Almost 10 years ago, I used to work as a Revenue Protection Inspector on the trains in London. It was a job I enjoyed but the money wasn’t great and so I left to start another career and eventually ended up living in the Midlands where I started working for a technology company.\n\nI rarely traveled on trains after I left but several years later I took an evening train down to London for a meeting early the next morning.\n\nThe train wasn’t very busy so I sat myself at a table seat and started working on a presentation on my laptop.\n\nAt the next station, a man in his early 20s boards the train and sits opposite me. He looked a bit shifty but I didn’t make eye contact with him and tried to ignore the loud jungle music that he started listening to on his phone without headphones. I put my AirPods in and put some music on to mask his music.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I noticed that he suddenly looked behind me and then got up from his seat and walked down the train carriage in the direction I was facing. 30 seconds later, a Revenue Protection Inspector walked through the carriage and politely asks to see my ticket, which I present to him.\n\nI take my AirPods out and explain to him that I don’t think the man who was sitting opposite me had a ticket.\n\n“Oh, what makes you say that?” He asked me with a slightly puzzled face.\n\nI told him that I used to work in Revenue Protection in London a few years ago and given that the man rushed out of his seat as soon as he entered the carriage to check tickets, I’d be more surprised if he did have a ticket. I joked that I was tempted to ask to see his ticket myself!\n\nHe thanked me for the information and continued on down the train.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, on his way back though the train, the Revenue Protection Inspector came up to me and said the man didn’t have a ticket and wasn’t even sure which station he was getting off at either.\n\n“Good catch 👍😁” he said to me with a smile and a thumbs up.\n\nI didn’t ask what the outcome was but inevitably it would be a Penalty Fare for him not having a ticket.\n\nI realised at that moment that the experience and skills I gained in apprehending ticketless passengers will always be with me.",

        "text": "So, this happened in May a week before Memorial Day in the United States in 2022 and I thought this was something that should be shared as it was one of the greatest moments I got to experience while working in security. It stuck with me and to this day makes working as a security guard worth it and out-way any bad I have experienced.\n\nI was working a graveyard shift at a local park that put up flags for fallen soldiers for Memorial day and I was tasked with making sure the flags were not knocked over by the strong winds that happen where I live. I was also tasked to make sure no vandalism took place. It was a calm post to work since most of the time I spent simply walking around an empty park as no one usually showed up outside of the occasional Sheriffs Officer who would use the calm moments to catch up on their shift reports. Most people would start to show up and walk around and look at the flags to pay their respect around 7 in the morning but the night in question, an army veteran came around 1 in the morning. He was with a friend and politely asked if he could walk around and pay his respects. Since the stadium park lights were still on, he was allowed to walk around.  \n\nBecause of the event, the section of the park where the flags were was supposed to remain open for 24 hours, but the lights to keep the park lit all night would shut off at 12 in the morning and I would have to turn people away. When the lights were out, the park was nearly pitch black, and was dangerous for people to walk at night with no lights on.  \n\nThankfully it was fixed and the lights would remain on until the sun started to come up at 6 in the morning. As the army vet would walk around, I would watch him salute each flag and I think there were about 100 flags in a perfect line. I could hear something but wasn’t sure what it was until I would see him collapse on his knees sobbing loudly at a few of the flags. It was heartbreaking to watch as I learned those flags, he knew the men who had served. His friend would help him, and the army vet would salute those flags and continue on.  \n\nWhen he was saluting all of the flags, the vet came up to me and hugged me tightly, thanking me for watching over each soldier, including his fallen friends. I told him it was the very least I could do for those who had served as they deserved to make sure their flags never fell and no one vandalized the memorial for them. He had a metal bracelet with two skulls at each end, and he took it off, handing it to me, saying to take it as a token of thanks. I tried to refuse as politely as possible, saying that I did this not to be thanked but being able to do this small task of simply watching the flags was an honor and something I was glad to do. He wouldn’t take no for an answer and handed the bracelet to me. He and I chatted for a little bit before he and his friend left for the night.  \n\nTo this day, I wear that bracelet every moment I can, remembering just how what one person would view as a boring job means so much more to someone else. And when people ask where to get a bracelet like this, I tell them they can’t and explain why. To me, these are the moments that make working as a security guard worth every painstaking hour and dealing with every Karen life throws at me.",

        "text": "So, I work the graveyard shift as a security guard for a small private company, and one of the places I have worked security for was at two hotels. One thing I do while I am at work is to try to do is be respectful and give someone the benefit of the doubt, especially when there is supposedly only one witness to something going on. I also try and be as respectful as I can be, even when the person or people I am dealing with are being uncooperative and belligerent.  \n\nOne of the things I do when I first get on shift is to talk to the front desk of the first hotel I would guard and see if they need anything before I begin my patrols for the night and I always checked in with the front desk as often as I could so they knew I was there to help if needed. I would then walk over to the second hotel and do the same thing. Most of the time they would ask me to go to a room and knock to let the guest know they were being a little too loud and that there was a noise complaint, and the guest would usually apologize and then quiet down for the night.  \n\nThis night in question, I had to deal with 3 entitled parents. One thing about the hotel is that the lobby closes to the public at 9 pm, so that means any large gatherings are prohibited from continuing at that time, and that is the time I would start work. I grabbed a radio so the hotels could contact me at any moment they needed security. I would walk from the first hotel after having let them know that I was on duty and I would make my way over to the second hotel and do the same thing. When I checked in with the front desk of the second hotel, the clerk behind the desk asked if I could talk to a group of adults who had been drinking and were getting very loud. I calmly and respectfully told them that they could continue their party in their rooms but they had to vacate the lobby as it was officially closed for the night. The clerk at the front desk had told me that she had tried to get them to quiet down and leave the lobby for the past 10 minutes yet they complained that as guests they were entitled to stay in the lobby.\n\nThey complained that the hotel had gotten security involved and complained on their way back to the rooms but left the lobby. I began my patrols when I got a call less than 30 minutes later at the same hotel because someone had complained that children were running in the halls. The hotel was currently hosting a sports event and many kids on the sports teams were there.  \n\nThe clerk behind the front desk had me meet her in the lobby and we went to the room we believed the children were, when I saw the kids, they said that they had all been outside until a moment ago when they came back to the room which I could verify as true. The kids then said that they had seen two kids that appeared to be twins running through the hallways. The clerk leaned her back and gave an exhausted sigh and told me that she had gotten all day about those two kids and she believed that the parents were in the group that had been kicked out of the lobby earlier.\n\nI walked around the hotel to see if I could find the room the kids were in and was stopped by hotel maintenance and told that they had seen those kids running away from the floor I was on and that the fire retardant cases were all open and one appeared to have been kicked in and was badly dented. I spotted the two kids in question and they immediately went back to their room at a running pace when they spotted me. I found out what room they were in and reported everything to the clerk before going to the first and second floor to find out if any more damage had happened and a guest had told me that they saw two twins running around the second floor and I found all of the cases open except one that had been broken, it was missing the handle and the glass was cracked.  \n\nI went to the lobby and showed the pictures of everything damage done and the clerk called her manager directly, at 10 pm on a Saturday night. (For those who don’t know, most hotel management is never in on the weekends.)\n\nThe manager had said that these kids and their parents needed to leave immediately and charge the room for all damages done to the hotel. I waited until 10:30 pm to go to the room, hoping that the parents would be back in the room. I went up to the room and knocked on the door, and one of the kids responded. The encounter went as followed,\n\nOP: Hello, I am security for the hotel. Are your parents in the room?\n\nEntitled Kid: No\n\nOP: Can you tell me where your parents are?\n\nEntitled Kid: In another room.\n\nOP: Can you tell me what room they are in?\n\nThe entitled kid told me what room the parents are in, and I immediately told the children to contact their parents and have them meet me up at the room. As soon as the door closed, I stepped away from the door but kept it in the immediate view and contacted the front desk and asked the clerk to wait with me since we were dealing with minors and for safety reasons for all parties involved, and didn’t want to deal with the “He was harassing us for no reason and stalking us all night” crap.\n\nThe parents took 15 minutes to come to the room as they expected me to leave the floor the children were on and I was afraid they would run to another room and break more stuff on the way. The first thing that happened was the entitled father started yelling at me.\n\nEntitled Father: What are you doing creeping outside of our children’s room?\n\nOP: Hello, I am a security officer with the hotel. I was asked to speak with you as your children have been accused of breaking hotel property.\n\nFriend of Entitled Parents: So you thought you would harass young boys? Do you get off on doing that or something?\n\nOP: Sir, your children have been accused of breaking hotel property and because of the risk of them supposedly doing this again. My job here is that I am assigned to protect this hotel from such things and as such, your children are considered a threat to the safety of the hotel.\n\nEntitled Father: You have no right to be outside of their room. You should have come to speak to us at our room, not be a creep and stand outside their room like a fucking pervert.\n\nOP: Sir, they are classified as a threat with the accusations of the destruction of private property. As it stands, the hotel managers have made it clear that you are no longer guests here and you must leave the property immediately.\n\nEntitled Mother: You have no proof that our children are behind this. They have perfectly behaved and they have been in their rooms all night.\n\nUnfortunately, as they kept trying to yell and talk over me, I was beginning to get irritated and was losing my polite attitude and started becoming that extreme asshole security guard with the cop attitude that no one wants to deal with.\n\nOP: That’s bullshit. I have hotel staff that has seen them outside of their room. I have guests in the hotel that have seen them outside of their room. And I have personally seen that they have been outside of their room.\n\nEntitled Mother: Everyone else is lying and personally targeting our children, including you. There are many children here that could be the culprits behind these accusations but you are just choosing to blame everything on our children.\n\nOP: I don’t care if you believe me or not, you need to leave the property immediately.\n\nIt is this moment that the entitled father got directly in my face and said, “I don’t have to do anything you say and we are not leaving, I work for the FBI.”\n\nI looked at him and demanded he shows me his federal credentials proving that he is a part of the FBI. The state that I live and work in states that if you identify as a member of local or federal law enforcement or as a federal employee, you have to show your credentials, even if you live in another state.\n\nThe entitled father said he didn’t have to until I told him this exact same law. He then told me that he left them in the room and needed to get them. When I was able to confirm that they didn’t want to leave, I calmly walked back to the hotel lobby, but not before the entitled friend said, “Go ahead and leave you pervert. You know you are wrong and that you have nothing to prove.”\n\nAs soon as I was in the elevator, I got on the radio with another clerk at the front desk and told them to call the local Sheriff's department and told her the entire encounter and explained that they were now trespassing on hotel property. While the clerk was on the phone, the night auditor came in and I briefed him on what was going on. The entitled father came down and began demanding the hotel give the family a full refund or they were not leaving and that they couldn’t do anything as he was FBI. He unfortunately severely scared the two clerks that were still on shift and made the night auditor nervous with this and I told them to let law enforcement know that the man was claiming this and that I now feared he had a weapon on the property. Thankfully they went back to their rooms after realizing that the hotel would not budge and they stayed in their rooms for the rest of the night. I checked all the hallways just in case but thankfully they remained clear for the rest of my shift.\n\nLaw enforcement showed up around 3 in the morning and when I explained everything to them, they became guarded, especially now that I said I feared the man was FBI and may have had a weapon on the property that was not registered in the hotel database. Law enforcement said that they could take the family away as they were trespassing but there was little that could be done. The parents told the officers that I had not talked to the parents nor had the hotel spoken to them about anything.\n\nThe entitled father and his friend started demanding information from the hotel about the clerks involved and all of my work information.  \n\nI told them I was not allowed to legally give out any of my work information outside of the name of my work. It wasn’t true but the guy believed it and said he would contact my work and make sure my superiors here about me and how I was a creep. The rest of the night was uneventful and the entitled family stayed in their rooms but that was because they didn’t want to leave and the night auditor was a nice guy and didn’t want to kick the children out at 4 in the morning with nowhere else to go.\n\nSince the kids of these entitled parents were connected to a sports group and there were about 10 to 15 rooms all connected under the group, the hotel decided to charge each room with the destruction of property and attached a report from both hotel staff had written and myself to make sure it was known why each room was charged over $500 in damages.\n\nOne of the fun thing about that night is that one of the Sheriffs that showed up was a friend from high school that I haven’t seen in over 10 years. It was nice to catch up with him and see that he was doing good.",

        "text": "  \n\nI worked for a university public safety department for 3 years and in that time, I worked with someone who had the trifecta of bad coworker, we will call him M. He was 3 things lazy/entitled, a wannabe cop, and a walking sexual harassment lawsuit.\n\nLet’s start with the first. We had a limited number of vehicles to patrol the campus and therefore they would be assigned to people at random. M would throw a fit if he wasn’t assigned a vehicle to the point where he would sit in the office and refuse to do anything until he was given a vehicle. He got so mad at some for driving “his” vehicle once that he threw a rockstar can at this person, he also in the same incident went and berated that person’s wife (who was a dispatcher) tell her to recall him so that he could take the vehicle. This guy had a horrible track record and at one point had crashed or damaged every patrol vehicle we had. Even when given a vehicle he would refuse to tasks that were considered beneath him and would only go to the “exciting” calls.\n\nHe was also a wannabe cop. He got a job at a funeral escort company so that he could put red and blue lights on his personal vehicle, would flash his public safety officer badge to get discounts at restaurants. This became such a problem that the restaurants refused to give anyone including our police officers’ discounts. It got so bad that he used his red and blue lights to pass traffic, he did this right in front of the chief of police, the assistant chief, and the commander for the department. You would think this would have gotten him fired but it merely got him put on a final warning.\n\nNone of this compared to him actively harass and stalk every young female employee that we had. It got so bad at one point that he would get into heated arguments with any male PSO that even talked to her. He would actively stalk her around the campus. This is what finally got him fired. He was actively doing the same routine with a new female employee, but he escalated to outside of work, when he showed up to her house uninvited. She complained to the department, and they finally fired him after 6 years of him pulling all of this crap.\n\nI wish this story had a better ending, but unfortunately after being fired, he landed a better job with the county government.",

I then have to suffer for an hour and a half till the cops show up. They tell her that the next call will be the last for her as a free woman. Turns out she is a big meth/Crack addict as well as some sort of mental incapacity.\n\nShe nearly took a swing at me (while the repo guy was getting in the car) and she thankfully thought twice because she lowered that fist pretty damn fast. \n\nJust a fun story doubt this isn't the first time and it won't be the last.",

        "text": "A bit of context for my job before the story, I work for a security company and one of our contracts is a grocery distribution center for a popular grocery store and gas station chain in my state. We deal the company trucks( to which I’ll refer to as FA for the story) over the road drivers that bring the he products to the distribution center. For the over the road drivers, they have appointment times and purchase order numbers that we put into the computer for them to be signed in and allowed into the facility. We also handle Loss Prevention calls from the site as well.\n\nWith that out of the way let’s get on with the story. \n\nI work at a grocery distribution center and my shift is 0600-1400. The day started off relatively busy as me and my coworker were signing in FA trucks and the over the road truck drivers. We had two drivers at the window that we were signing in, when a truck pulls up into the drive way and  puts his brakes on. The rules at the distribution center state that all over the road drivers must park on the street before they can be signed in. So I say to the driver that I was signing in that I need to turn this driver around, and that I apologize for the inconvenience, the driver said no worries take your time. So I head outside to the drive way and approached the driver and asked him how his day was, the driver ( who I’ll call Tom) said that he’s doing alright but doesn’t want to be late for his 0930 appointment. I said “sir I understand you don’t want to be late, it is currently 0845. You have enough time to be signed in. I can not sign you right now however, could you come into our lot and turn around and park on the street please. This lane is the in lane for our FA trucks and the other over the road drivers come in here, and you are currently blocking a FA truck from coming in.” Tom didn’t seem like he didn’t care for what I had to say and said that he’s backing up, to which I said that it wouldn’t be safe for him to do that since there are trucks behind him. But Tom didn’t care so he backed up almost hitting the truck behind him. Tom parked on the corner blocking another entrance way for a different company. So one of their drivers started to yell at Tom and Tom just kept walking up to the window telling the two at the window to move out of his fu**** way when they said Tom proceeded to call them a slur that starts with R and is used for a slur for people who are mentally ill. I told Tom that he was being disrespectful and i easing going to serve him because he’s still illegally parked. Tom didn’t like my answer and became even more irate and proceeded to call me and my coworker a slur that starts with n for African Americans. I will say I was totally in the wrong for what I did next but I was pretty upset so I told him to go f himself and move his fucking truck. He said that he’s not moving his fu**** truck. So I closed the window and called Steve. Now Steve was a higher up in the distribution center, if a driver was being unreasonable we call him. So I told Steve what happened and he told that Tom could go piss off and his load will be rejected. I told Tom that his load had neon canceled and that he needs to step away from the window and if he doesn’t I would be forced to call the police. Tom left and that was the last I saw of him. I apologized to the two drivers for my language that I used. They said it was alright and they understand that I was upset.",

        "text": "So, I was brand new to security when this happened.  That business with Securitas for 3 months doesn't......doesn't count. (bonus points if you get that modified reference). For context, this was a violent, gang infested, armed site, and by coincidence, my company uniform greatly resembles a police uniform. Black shirt, black tactical pants, black shoes or boots, gun belt, etc. \n\nThis location was a small apartment complex, consisting of 5 small parking lots and 6 apartment buildings. The shift was 6 hours a night, and every so often, I would drive patrol the parking lots, and then set up static post in my vehicle at a randomly selected parking lot. Client has nothing in place to keep a pattern, or track when and where we went. \n\nSo, I'm sitting in a lot, and I notice through the glass patio door of a second floor apartment, a number of young kids cowering in fear, with their hands in defensive positions. I had been hearing yelling and screaming in an apartment, but the client only wants the exterior watched. When I saw the kids, I put two and two together, and broke protocol to place a quiet call to the local PD to request a welfare check on the kids. It looked like physical child abuse may have been happening. \n\nAs I'm waiting for PD, smoking a cigarette, I see some guy in raggedy clothing walk up and start staring through the driver's window of my clearly marked (and strobe lighted) patrol vehicle. He's bent sideways to his left at his hips as he stares at me. Now, when I don't know a person, I'm getting out of the car to talk to them. Cars are bullet magnets and will become your tomb, so I want to be mobile and a smaller target.\n\nI get out, ask him how his night is going and if I can help him. He promptly pulls a yellow prescription pill bottle from his pocket and asks \"Hey man, you wanna buy some hydros?\" In my mind, I envisioned my uniform, thinking \"Do I not look enough like a cop? Or is he just that high?\" I decline, but he persists. For whatever reason, I get the idea to play a mind game with him. I said \"I'm not interested, but a friend of mine is on the way, and they would be VERY interested in what you have.\" (hinting at PD on the way) His face lit up, \"Oh, alright! I'll just wait for your friend then. What does he drive, and what does he look like?\" \n\nSince this guy technically hadn't broken a crime yet, I just wanted him gone, but wasn't sure if he would escalate if I flat out told him to leave. I decided to take my mind game a little further, see if he would catch on. \"Well, my friend drives a white car, with big black bumper bolted on, red and blue strobe lights, and they're dressed just like me.\" Dude is still clueless, but now he keeps trying to circle behind me, which I don't like. So he keeps trying to circle behind me, and I keep rotating to face him. \n\nCop finally arrives, and I told him it's my friend and I have to talk to her. I poke my head in the passenger window and tell her why I called. She asked who the dude is behind me. I told her that's a second reason she's here, but it happened after my call. Explained he tried to sell narcotics to me. She requested a narcotics officer as backup. \n\nIn the end, the kids were fine, it was a pillow fight and the yelling was a different apartment. Cops searched him, found a kitchen paring knife in his pocket, a backpack full of vitamins and legal herbal supplements, and the hydrocodone was prescribed to him, but I was able to have him trespassed. \n\nPart of me wonders if he was going to stab me and rob me if he had gotten behind me. \n\nAnd seriously, how high does someone have to be to think \"That guy looks like a cop and had a gun, let me try to sell illegal narcotics to him!\"\n\nThe weird shit you deal with in security.",

        "text": "Hospital officer here. [I'm talking about this scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gduv5A2Yisc)\n\nThere was this one homeless guy who was refusing to leave the hospital. He'd been there for several weeks and would fake a fall every time transport showed up, extending his stay. He had medical issues, but none of them were emergent and he was stable, so the hospital finally had enough and we trespassed his ass for mooching off of the medical system.\n\nSo the day finally came. We were ready. I had rapport previously from previous calls, but that bridge got burned as soon as I started explaining that him leaving was non-negotiable. As the charge nurse was explaining to him that it was finally over and he was going to leave one way or another, he started jabbing his cane her way and making threats. \"If you take one more step towards me, I'll bash your fucking head in. I'm not fucking leaving. I'll die first.\"\n\nSo as the rest of my team, the house supervisor, and the charge nurse were trying to convince this guy to gtfo, I simply stood at the foot of his bed just out of reach and pulled out of my notepad. I watched him intently. Every time he said something, I wrote it down, then kept watching him.\n\nHe challenged me directly twice. \"What the fuck are you writing?\" and \"Is your memory that shit?\" Wordlessly, I simply watched him until he was finished speaking, wrote down what he said, then resumed watching him.\n\n-----\n\nAt this point, the house sup was calling police. She was on the phone with them just within earshot and said, \"he threatened to bash my head in. With a cane.\"\n\nHe screams, \"NO I DIDN'T, SHE'S A FUCKING LIAR. THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL ME, HELP!\"\n\nI finally speak up for the first time since the call started. \"She's lying? I've got it right here. Let's see, I wrote them all down as they were said.\"\n\nAnd I started reading off his threats. \"I'm gonna bash your head in.\" And, \"You're gonna be missing some teeth.\" And, \"This isn't a weapon, it's a cane. It's not a crime.\" (as an aside: \"Wrong, by the way, it's still a weapon under the law.\") \"And...\"\n\nI nonchalantly sidle up to him as I'm listing.\n\nHim: \"I didn't say ANY of that shit.\"\n\nI snag his cane in a flash.\n\nMe, raising my voice for the first time: \"Dude, look: you have one-two-three... ten people in this room as witnesses. I've got it all written down word for word! You're done! So if you don't want to end up in a cell tonight for terrorist threats, then scoot. And don't even think about falling again. If I see so much as a toe on that floor again, I'm arresting you - trespass, assault, threats. All of it. Test me!\"\n\n-----\n\nTen minutes later, as we saw him loaded into the ambulance, we had the \"Don't come back, have a nice day,\" \"fuck you.\" exchange, as is typical with trespass orders. High fives all around.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/9j987i/the_reason_that_security_at_my_hotel_wasnt/",
        "text": "So in one of my posts, I mentioned that management at Swanky Hotel was so focused on image over quality of service that they created a rule that Security couldn’t call 911 anymore (obviously illegal, as many people pointed out, but they had their own definition of legality). To paint a little picture, the hotel I worked at was extremely old. Next to the hotel was an even older church that was all but condemned. We bought the church and the land it was on so we could use the parking lot as the Valet Lot for the hotel and used the decrepit church as a massive storage warehouse for the hotel. The engineering department mostly used this building for old furniture, decorations, equipment, etc. One day they pulled out 6 rusty ass old copper planters that were meant to be picked up for restoration. They were quite large, and pretty heavy, but they were in shitty shape. At the time, the hotel was under construction, and we were pretty used to random work vehicles coming and going from all of our lots. You see where this is going. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nI remember one day, around shift change (3:00pm), I was chatting with the day shift and getting filled in on whatever bullshit happened that day. As I looked at the camera, I noticed an SUV driving through the front drive of the hotel. It was towing a trailer, so I wrote it off in my mind as a work vehicle belonging to one of the many construction workers that were working on the building. Mistake. About 2 hours later, the head of engineering called me, saying that his degenerate of a son was in his car on break (aka getting high) and noticed a methed out looking man loading 4 of the planters onto his trailer and driving away. The engineering director initially thought it was the person picking them up for restoration, but quickly realized that they weren’t supposed to be picked up until later in the week and the person picking them up surely would have contacted him to let him know they were on their way. So he called us.\n\nI reviewed the footage and saved images of the car entering the hotel, as well as grainy pictures of him loading the planters and exiting the Valet Parking Lot. He had left two planters behind and I assumed he would be coming back for them. I was speaking with Engineering and suggested that they place the remaining 2 planters in the Church so they wouldn’t be taken as well. He literally looked at me like I was the biggest idiot he had ever seen and immediately dismissed me. I wrote my report and made sure the other agents knew what was going on, as well as pulled up the cameras trained on the Parking Lot on an accessory computer so we could monitor all comings and goings of the lot. Then I left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nI came back the next day at my normal time, and my cameras were still pulled up, but the remaining planters were gone. Thinking this was fishy, I rewind the footage and see the same vehicle from the day before pull in around noon and load up the remaining planters. Just as I suspected. I notified my boss, who notified the engineering director, who told me to call the police and file a report. I asked how much the planters were worth, and he quoted the at $1500 each, brand new. I called non-emergency and asked to file a stolen property report. They sent a detective over to take my statement, and I gave him my incident reports, as well as the stills from the surveillance cameras I had saved. I also told him how much the planters were worth. He took my info and left. The rest of my shift went by pretty quietly and I left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\nThe next day I came in and all hell was breaking loose. It turns out the police department had taken to social media and posted the surveillance stills I gave the officers, and misquoted the value. Then I found out there were several articles written by different news outlets titled “15,000 worth of equipment stolen from Swanky Hotel.” The asshole GM was RAGING. There were rumors that news crews were going to be showing up to film stories and for Security not to interact with them or give statements. I was blamed for the information getting out, even though 2 members of upper management instructed me to call the police and file a report. Ultimately, the person who stole the planters was caught, and I had to attend his court hearing. He was banned from property for life and forced to repay the amount lost by the hotel, I think $2000 as quoted by the scrap metal shop he took them to. Ultimately, nothing bad really came from it. But the GM still saw this as bad press for the hotel and decided to come up with the “Security can’t be trusted to call 911” rule that ended up preventing me from doing a lot more work by just calling in issues anonymously from my cell phone instead of having to write extensive incident reports. I still remember him cornering me on one of my patrols to interrogate me on what I had told the detective. I know he wanted me to take the blame so he could pin the whole thing on me, but I refused to give him that satisfaction and just told him that I did what was ordered by my superiors. Fuck that guy.\n\n  \nAnd the real kicker is the Engineering Department Director’s degenerate son was in on the whole thing and tipped off the thief to the planters’ location. ",

        "text": "So I'm on a contracted out site, lots of necessary customer interaction. My memory is very poor and I can't read shorthand (my writing is bad enough) so I take Lots of notes. Still concise, just more than your average security guard. I'm a HUGE supporter of CYA so I document as much as I can. When I did patrols. If a problem client returns to a site (monitoring). Etc etc. \n\n\nHowever, I also have a personal notebook where I write down what people say. This is from multiple bosses and supervisors and my parents insisting \"I never said that\" or \"I don't think you did that\" or even the dreaded \"clearly, you're not doing your job.\"\n\n\nClient on current site didn't want me to write at all in my personal notebook so my security notebook became every. single. interaction. on site. Despite our relief guard using her own notebook no problems (pretty sure he just doesn't like me.)\n\n\nSo today my coworker goes on break, I relieve her. I write the time and that I relieved coworker for a break in my notebook. Client comes up and tells me he'll be speaking to my supervisor about writing notes and that he doesn't want me writing notes at all. THEN he emails supervisor, twists it like I was writing in my personal notebook and that was the problem. I firmly told supervisor that the client had insisted I not take *any* notes. Supervisor reminds me notes should be relevant to the site and quick. I agree and tell her she is free to peruse my notebook when she comes for a site inspection mid October. \n\n\nBut this. THIS is why I take shitton of notes. And why I have a personal notebook at all. Heck, my coworker has even used my notebook as reference *because* I document everything. Want to know exactly when the ambulance pulled up? Lemme check my notebook. Not only that but coworker has told me the client has expressed discontent before with \"note taking\" and she has TOLD him it's necessary for the job. Already had a previous guard quit because the client didn't like her. I'm starting to think he's trying to get rid of me. Since the only security companies in town are crap I'll be seriously considering McDonald's. I happen to *like* customer service. ",

Due to the nature of the place, it is membership based and somewhat sensitive in how it’s handled. The officers who work this post must walk the fine line between security and diplomacy at all times, moreso than most posts.\n\nThis incident happened a couple weekends ago. On weekends, we have two officers: one at the gate, and one in back on patrol; I’m the officer on patrol. Toward the end of my 0000-0800 shift I’m availing myself of the gatehouse’s A/C for a minute when I hear yelling. I can’t make it out well because my coworker on gate never shuts up. We’ll call him Chatty Charlie, or CC for short. Repeated non-verbal cues for him to be quiet don’t work so I finally shush him like a 2yo and can hear two gentlemen disagreeing (loudly) near one of the entrances, and they’re headed our way.\n\nI go out to meet them and do the standard is everything ok problem solving stuff. It’s your basic domestic argument, nothing extreme, just some upset people. CC is busily having a panic attack in the background, but this is nothing I need help with anyway so I ignore him. I get the guys separated and cooling down, but one of them is a guest, not a member. If he’s no longer willing to stay with his partner, he’s not allowed on grounds.\n\nI’m attempting to resolve this issue, including escalating to a property manager due to some interesting situational complications, but while I’m stepped back on the phone CC is the only one mediating between the couple. This is where things go sideways. In his infinite “wisdom,” my idiot coworker decides loudly demanding one of the gentlemen CALM DOWN, SIR is the best course of action. Why? Why me?\n\nOf course, this goes over like a lead balloon. Whereas before the gentleman was upset but reasonable, he is now pissed. CC’s solution? Repeat the demand. Louder, to speak over the now Very Pissed Man. I’m finishing my call as fast as I possibly can, but even as I’m hanging up I can hear VPM shouting the veiled threat of the truly PO’d, “you’ll know when I’m pissed!” CC is advancing physically, squaring off, still repeating himself like the most moronic broken record in history, and now VPM is moving forward too, also puffing up. Jesus. I don’t want to do first aid today. I’ve got less than two hours til end of shift, I don’t need this nonsense.\n\nI physically block CC from moving any further and speak only to VPM, trying to RE-defuse the situation I’d already freaking defused. The only saving grace to CC’s idiocy is he tends to defer to me, thank Christ, so he shut up and stepped back. I got things settled (finally, took a minute) and after some calm and reasonable discussion the two go back home.\n\nI wish to god I could say it ended there. Nearly having my buffoon of a coworker clocked was certainly enough excitement for me for a night. But no, his mouth knows no filter... He starts badmouthing VPM *before the guy has even left earshot!* I regret to say I was not very diplomatic with my coworker then. I was more than done with his epic stupidity and inability to handle even the most basic of situations, and snapped at him to STFU.\n\nThe kicker? He’s still on this post, despite an overwhelming number of complaints against him. Some people should not work security.",

        "text": "I posted about a week and a half ago about the seemingly cursed parking garage at a casino I worked at a few years ago. There was some interest in getting some more stories from a casino environment so I said I would start posting a few periodically. I told a couple of you that I would have a few up this past weekend, but I came down with strep and just haven't had the energy to type up anything of substance. I'm feeling a little bit better tonight, so I figured I'd take the time to tell you guys about some of the smaller things that happened out there. These ones aren't going to be nearly as \"what the fuck\"-esque as the last few I posted. The first story is just a short one about a rather amusing situation that happened on an otherwise uneventful night. The second is for those of you that asked me about what it is like to work in a gaming environment. Keep in mind that this is based on my experience in a tribally owned casino and would not necessarily translate to other casinos. I'll get more in depth with that at some point if there is any interest left by the end of this post. I'm still slightly feverish, so hopefully this will make sense.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Strange Call From The Hotel Staff\n\nOn one relatively slow night, I had wandered down to hang out with this girl I knew in the Valet department. It was getting close to last call, so it was the point in the night where they normally needed an extra person to keep an eye out for any intoxicated guests that were trying to retrieve their vehicles for the drive home. I was in her small office in front of the casino and we were talking about grabbing a drink when we got off in a few hours. After a couple of minutes, a call came out from on of the hotel housekeepers asking for surveillance. Being that it was about 1:30am in the middle of the week, we knew whatever would be coming next was going to be interesting. The transmission went something like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHK: Public Spaces to  Post 1 and Surveillance\n\nS: Go ahead for surveillance\n\nHK: We just got a strange report from a guest that came walking by. They said the ice machine on the 8th floor seems to be leaking out all over the place. We were hoping you could roll back the footage from that hallway and just see if you see anything. Post 1 could you also send us a rover?\n\nP1: We don't have a rover on right now. Post 8 could swing up, but why do you need security for this? Have you been up to take a look?\n\nS: Surveillance also copies, but what exactly are we looking for?\n\nHK: Well... I don't want to say over the radio... We... Uh... Well we sent somebody up to take a look... There definitely seems to be liquid around the ice machine, but I don't think it's leaking out. The odor.... Um... Surveillance could you just roll back about 15 minutes and see what comes up?\n\nS: Surveillance copies. We will take a look.\n\nP8: Post 8 to Post 1... Do you want me to head that way?\n\nP1(Not Putting The Pieces Together Yet): Um... Hold on. Is Public Spaces still on this channel?\n\nHK:  This is Public Spaces.\n\nP1: Can you give me a call at (extension for BOH Security Desk)?\n\n\\*\\*\\*About 1 Minute Passes\\*\\*\\*\n\nBy this time a couple other Valet Attendants have wandered over to listen\n\nP1: Post 1 to Post 8. Go ahead and start heading that way. We're not really sure what's going on, but it sounds like they'd really like some assistance.\n\nP8: Copy I'm about 3 minutes out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Another 2-3 minutes pass\\*\\*\\*\n\nS: Surveillance to Post 1.\n\nP1: Go for Post 1.\n\nS: So listen... We need to get a couple more people heading that way. We're going to need you to make contact with a guest in their room. Is their a Sierra 4 (one of the security managers) on this channel right now?\n\n4: Go ahead for S4\n\nS: Listen, we need to have a word with whoever did the cutoff in (bar name withheld) about 30 minutes ago. I believe it was Sierra 37\n\n4: Copy. Do You need me to call you on my cell?\n\nS: ....Negative... So what it looks like happened is he responded to the call for the cutoff. When he got their the guests had already started heading back toward the hotel of their own accord. 37 watched them go up the escalator, but didn't follow them to make sure they made it to their room. They... Okay so it's kind of hard to tell from the angle of the camera so maybe Post 8 can confirm.... So it looks like they stepped off of the elevator and started heading toward their room. When they came to the ice machine, one male in the group approached the ice machine, opened the door, and proceeded to urinate in and around the ice machine. How Copy?\n\n\\*\\*\\*At this point those of us listening to the transmission were obviously laughing our asses off\\*\\*\\*\n\n4: I'm going to hope that was a bad copy Surveillance.\n\nS: Repeating - Male subject urinated in, on, and around the ice machine on the 8th floor of the hotel.\n\nP8: Post 8 can confirm.... definitely urine all over the floor.\n\n4: ... Solid Copy..... S4 to S13...\n\nME: Negative 4. This one is all you, buddy. 13 to 37, meet me by Post 1, we're going to meet with Surveillance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... While I went with S37 to the surveillance office, the other manager headed up to meet with housekeeping and the other security ambassadors at the ice machine. They basically just awkwardly stood their while the surveillance team worked on tracking down exactly which guest it was. They then contacted them in their room and removed them from the property. When I talked to S4 afterward, he told me the guy was soaked. He and one other guy had to change clothes after removing him from the property. They may have disagreed, but I personally thought the whole ordeal was hilarious. If it had been a busy night I may have felt different, but that night it was much needed excitement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHiring In A Casino: (frustration story - read the first paragraph and then skip to the 4th paragraph if you don't want to read all the background)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, before I start this story I want to point out that this is a subject that people tend to get extremely defensive about. Every time I mention it in a company that has never worked for a tribally owned entity, a lot of people swear up and down that it isn't true. They then call you everything but white and swear that you are just trying to make Indian tribe look bad. Before anybody here does that, let me ask you to take just 15 seconds out of your time to Google the phrase \"tribal hiring preference\". Basically what it means is that in tribally owned entities, the company may choose to hire applicants based solely on tribal enrollment (they are legally Indians) regardless of whether there are more qualified applicants. They do not even have to meet the requirements of the job for hiring/promoting/scheduling/seniority preferences to apply.\n\nOkay, now that we have that out of the way...  Our Director of Human Resources was an enrolled member of the tribe that owned the casino, and she had an absolute lady boner for throwing the tribal preference policy out when we chose to hire anybody that wasn't native. During one round of hiring, I had a solid 50/50 split on tribal and non-tribal applicants.   Normally, that is a really good sign. As any of you that have done any hiring know, it's absolutely the worst part of management. It isn't at all uncommon for half of the people scheduled for interviews not to show up. With tribal applicants, you normally don't run into that problem. They usually know enough people within the company that no-showing an interview can hurt their reputation.\n\nUnfortunately, this time around didn't follow the usual pattern. I had 10 interviews per day scheduled 4 days in a row. Those days I had to be fully decked out in a tailored suit with leather soled dress shoes (most days I could pass with nice slacks, a polo and vest, and my duty boots and on most big event days other than New Year's Eve I could just wear a suit with my duty boots), facial hair had to be 100% in regulations as, and I had to show up 3 hours earlier than I typically did. Overall, these days were just a huge pain in the ass. When people decided not to show up with all of the extra work it was absolutely infuriating. By the time the 4th day came around, I was pretty pissed. I had a grand total of 7 people (none of them tribal) show up for their interviews in the past 3 days, and my first three interviews the 4th day were no-shows. \n\nMy 4th interview that day was with a member of another tribe. Judging by her resume, I was guessing that she was a middle aged woman that could adapt to a security environment pretty well. She hadn't done this time of work directly, but she had a strong customer service back ground and had 5+ years of casino experience. Not ideal, but there seemed to be potential. When she showed up, I was surprised to find a small (probably 5'2) Indian woman in her mid 60s. She reminded me more of my grandmother than somebody that should be working security. \n\nThat said, I try not to judge people based on appearance, so I started asking her questions with an open mind. The first few questions were just the standard ice breakers; \"Tell me a little about yourself\", \"Why do you want to work at random casino\", \"Tell me about your prior work experience\". Her answers were pretty short, but I just chalked it up to interview nerves and decided to continue into the job specific parts of the interview. The rest of the interview went something like this.\n\nMe: So this job will require working outside in all weather conditions. During the winter, we are routinely outside for the entirety of a shift in sub freezing temperatures. During the summer, we are often outside in temperatures above 100 degrees. Have you worked in an environment like this before and are you comfortable with it?\n\nHer: \\*Silence\\*\n\nMe: Ma'am?\n\nHer: Yes?\n\nMe: Are you comfortable with that aspect of this position?\n\nHer: Not really. I would prefer to work inside at a desk.\n\nMe: That is not an option for this position. Will you be able to fulfill that requirement of the position?\n\nHer: Oh.... Well... I suppose I can do that.\n\nMe: Alright, great. Another thing that I would like to mention is that while we try to handle all situations with unruly customers in a diplomatic manner. That said, this is a security job. At times, things escalate to a point that we have to handle them in a more physical manner. While we do avoid this whenever possible, it is a reality of security work. Do you have any concerns with that part of the job?\n\nHer: \\*A long pause\\* I don't like that. Can't we just call the cops.\n\nMe (at this point I know that this is not going to be a good fit, but I decide to do the complete interview and see if she may be better suited for another opening we had in the department at the time): Well, ma'am, this is a security job. That isn't always an option when things get out of hand. This is a very fast paced job.\n\nHer: \\*Silence\\*\n\nMe: \\*After a long pause\\* ...Okay... So our establishment in known for providing world class customer service. Our core purpose and core values all focus on that aspect of what we do. In your mind, what constitutes great customer service and what can you do as an individual to try to generate return business? (I'm trying to lead her a little bit and throw her a bone).\n\nHer: \\*Silence\\*\n\nMe: (Starting to get annoyed) Ma'am. In your words, what constitutes great customer service?\n\nHer: I don't know. Can I pass on this question?\n\nMe: You're not even going to try to answer the question? I'm not looking for anything specific. I just want to know your opinion on the subject.\n\nHer: Pass.\n\nMe: (A long pause to keep my composure rather than just telling her to get the fuck out of my office and deciding not to ask anymore questions) Okay... So why should I hire you? What can you bring to the table that other people may not be able to?\n\nHer: I'm a member of (omitted) Indian Tribe.\n\nMe: Yes, I'm well aware of that. What skills or abilities do you bring to the table that should be considered in my hiring decision?\n\nHer: (responding smugly) I think that will be enough.\n\nMe: Alright, well we are done here. Thanks for coming in. Yada yada. Professional BS\n\nHer: So when will I start.\n\nMe: Ma'am, I'm not going to be hiring you. You aren't the right fit for this position. I know that is disappointing, but you are more than welcome to apply for other positions here at the casino.\n\nHer: Says nothing and storms out of the office.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the rest of the day, I actually I had a few really good interviews. I just had one position available on the team, so I went back to my main office to review my interview notes and make a decision. Once I had made my selection, I typed up a summary off all the interviews and sent off the paperwork and job req to the HR department with instructions to extend a job offer to young woman that I interviewed later in the day. I then got all of my stuff together and headed home.\n\nWhen I woke up the next day around 10am, I noticed I had an email from the Human Resources Director, but decided that I wasn't going to read it until I got to work. When I pulled up in front of my office, one of my guys made a B-line to where I had parked. He asked me something along the lines of \"Dude, what the fuck was with that email HR sent all of us?\" I told him I wasn't aware of any department wide emails before I left but if something came in while I was riding in I hadn't seen it yet (I had about an hour commute and rode a motorcycle, so I didn't see anything until I got logged into my work computer). He basically said that I needed to get in there and read this ASAP. When I walked in, I saw that the only email I had outside of department reports was from the Human Resources Director so I opened it. I immediately noticed that she had CC'ed my entire department, the entire HR department, and the VP who my department fell under. I don't work there anymore so I don't have access to that email account, so I'm going to paraphrase what it said.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\" u/_deuceswild_\n\nI recently was made aware of the hiring requisition you placed for the opening in your department. In reviewing your interview notes, I see that you interviewed one Mrs. TooGoodToAnswer. I am not sure what in your interview made you think that she \"would not be a good fit\" for your team, but I strongly consider you reconsider that position. I happen to know Mrs. TooGoodToAnswer personally. She is an enrolled member of NotOurTribe Tribe of Indians and I feel that she would be an excellent addition to your team. I have placed a hold on your hiring requisition and am awaiting a response from both you and (my direct boss' name).\n\nSincerely,\n\nDelusional Director of Human Resources\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, I was pretty pissed off when I read that email. I sat there for a minute before noticing that everybody in the office had stopped what they were doing and they all were staring at me. I calmly stood up, asked on of them to make a pot of coffee, and went outside to have a couple cigarettes and calm down. After calming down a bit, I called all of my crew out to have a pre-shift meeting and then sent them out to make their rounds. I stepped back inside and sent the following email. I of course hit the 'reply all' button.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\" Delusional Director of Human Resources\n\nI must say, I am very surprised to learn that you have taken issue with my decision to hire Ms. FutureAwesomeEmployee over Mrs. TooGoodToAnswer. I thought my reasons for making this selection were quite clearly stated in my interview summary along with my attached interview notes, but if not allow me to clarify. My decision to hire Ms. FutureAwesomeEmployee did not come down to a choice between her and Mrs. TooGoodToAnswer. In fact, I had decided against hiring Mrs. TooGoodToAnswer before she even led the office. I reached my decision based on the facts that she did not find the conditions of this position to be acceptable for her and she did not feel the need to even attempt to answer the questions asked during the interview. I cannot in good conscience add her to my team knowing that we all must work together to ensure a safe and secure environment. I hope this clears up any confusion you may have.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I would appreciate if you would direct those questions to me personally, however, as opposed to including multiple individuals who have no bearing on my hiring decisions. It is my opinion that that would not only be the more professional course of action, but it will ensure that no confidential information regarding our applicants are sent to anybody that shouldn't be.\n\nThank you and have a great weekend.\n\nu/_deuceswild_ \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlmost immediately, I received an email from my direct manager (he was in his mid 60s at the time) said just simply read \"LOL\". About 10 minutes later an email came through (also a reply all) from our VP that said something along the lines of \"That reasoning sounds good to me\". I never got a response from the Director of Human Resources, but a couple hours later an email came through from the recruiting staff letting me know that the individual I told them to hire had accepted a job offer and was scheduled for orientation the following week while I was on vacation (pending a background check and issuance of a tribal gaming license) and she would be ready to train when I got back. For what it's worth, she turned out to be a phenomenal employee. We had some personal issues, but she is the person I am most proud of having developed. \n\nI included this story because some of you guys asked me what it's like to work at a casino. While it is a really fun, unique environment, it also has a lot of political issues that aren't faced in other places. In fact, that politics are a big part of what led to me turning in my resignation a few years ago. I'm looking at going back to the casinos now, but it isn't without its challenges. If you are interested in going to work in that kind of environment I would encourage you to do your research before hand. It can be incredibly rewarding, but it isn't without its challenges.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "One of my co-workers (let's call him Will) has a habit of posting snippets from his day to his facebook account. Nothing major just enough for people to go WTF? about our job. Our boss knows and as long as he leaves client names and locations out of it he doesn't care. Given the post he works most of the same post I do I get to hear about his antics from outside sources as well. What my boss can't seem to understand is why clients seem to like his dark humor so much.  \n\n\nWhat's important to understand is he has seen some shit. To give you an idea of his age and why- he went to college for forensic chemical analysis and the same year he was set to graduate the mass spectrometer was released. So his entire degree became invalidated by a machine the year he would graduate. Rather than wasting his education he managed to get a job on merit as a forensic investigator and still occasionally consults with local LEOs when needed. Sometimes the only way to stay sane when dealing with some of the things a job like that subjects you to (for instance a recent drug related murder spree which killed the parents, adult son, two teens and a toddler in a nearby town) is to find a way to laugh. That said with his permission I'm going to reshare some of his more memorable moments from facebook with a bit of editing to preserve anonymity.  \n\\---  \n\n\n Customer: \" Do you think if I ask God to help me, he'd help me win on slots?\"\n\n  \nWill: \" I think the big G might be busy. Try going the other way..\"\n\n  \nCust: \" O LORD LUCIFER HELP ME WIN TODAY!\" ( she won. A lot.)\n\n  \nCust: \" thank you!!\"\n\n  \nWill: \" Dont thank me. You know who. Manners are very important.\"\n\n  \nCust: \" How?\"\n\n  \nWill: \" I have no clue. If you dont have any spare unbaptized children, go have a drink and buy one for him? Maybe a pastel slanket?\". \n\n  \n\\---\n\n  \n Customer: \" Can I borrow 400 from you? I just spent ( gambled away) my rent and I have kids.\"\n\n  \nWill: \" No. Do you have a pair of high heels in your size, sir ?\" \n\n  \n\\---\n\n  \nBit of background for this one- this woman has repeatedly tried to \"entice\" every guard posted at this site to give her $20 for a few minutes in the bathroom with her. the woman is more plastic at this point than flesh and is obviously getting on in years.  \n\n\n Crackhead Barbie: \" why dont you ever take me up on my offers?\"  \nWill: ( unable to resist anymore) \" No offense, truly. But your bf has a nice ass. Does he bottom?\"  \nCB: ( is crying real tears from laughing so hard watching her pimp lose his composure)   \n\\---  \n Two guys in front of him having a conversation in spanish: \" how hard do you think it would be to rob this place?\"\n\n  \nWill, in spanish: \" Pretty hard considering the person behind you has a gun and speaks Spanish.\"\n\n  \nThey left... \n\n  \n\\---\n\n  \nWill to guy parking in the fire lane: \" you might not wanna do that. The police ticket people.\"\n\n  \nHim: ( long string of expletives as the police pull up behind him as hes in my face)\n\n  \nCop: \" Want me to ticket him?\"\n\n  \nMe:\" If you'd be so kind.\"\n\n  \n( guy has 31 tickets, police arrest him and tow his car to impound)\n\n  \nCop: \" We good?\"\n\n  \nMe: \" Yup. Owe you a doughnut.\"\n\n  \n( Officer leaves laughing) \n\n  \n\\---\n\n  \n So this morning as I was waiting for the manager to show up, the fun began. I'm standing near the doors. Relaxed, listening to Wolfshiem, chill. 2 cars pull up in the very closest spots and one guy gets out of each car, each holding a paper bag. They exchange bags and one guy says, \" this ain't the good shit\" and pulls a gun. Guy 2 pulls a gun and says, \" if you don't want it, gimme it back..\". Mind you, they're at point blank range aimed at each others heads. Then they both look over at me. Not even thinking, I say, \" What the fuck are you looking at me for? A fucking referee?\"  \nWithout a further word, they got in their respective vehicles and left. Either I'm an idiot or very little phases me.   \nEdit: I should mention our uniform for this site is a tan button up, silver name plate over the right breast pocket, gold badge over the left, silver chain running from the right shoulder to the whistle in our right pocket, and our duty belt at minimum has gun, taser, and mace, usually also baton. If your not versed in the state and local cop uniforms (and sometimes even if you are) it's easy to mistake us as actual law enforcement. \n\n  \n\\---\n\n  \nI happened to be out front having a nicotine break and saw a truck back into a car and almost immediately Local cops were there. They had to be just around the corner.\n\n  \nCop: \" Did you see the truck back up into the mustang?\"\n\n  \nMe: \" Yes. ( gives description of the guy in the mustang that bailed and ran like hell)\"\n\n  \nCop: \" Why didn't you stop him?\"\n\n  \nMe: \" Well, I'm not a police officer with arrest and detainment authority, so that's one. Two, I cannot leave site. My authority ends here. Third, my taser doesn't fire that far and I'm sure as hell not shooting anyone in the back. Also, them running from \\* this\\* car? Its stolen or they have a shitton of warrants out for their arrest. Lastly, he had no gloves in and was touching \\* everywhere\\* on the mustang, so it wont be hard to get clean prints. Door, outer door, side window, hood, etc.\".\n\n  \nCop: \"so the truck just backed into the car in the parking lot?\"\n\n  \nMe: ( shakes my head and goes inside) ",

        "text": "I used to do security at a 4 star name brand hotel and ive had quite a few situations that are reddit worthy. Ive already told you fine folks about the birth of Fry Whore and the Disney on Rocks so here is another involving a staff member of the hotel.\n\nPart of my job is to escort the bartender to her vehicle so she does not get harassed. Now we have swapped phone numbers so if im out making a round and she needs help she can text me and i can get there fast (they didn't think to give the night bartender a radio...*sigh*)\n\nSo i get her to her car and she leaves. I begin to make a parking lot check when my cell rings and its the bartender. Shes telling me that right across the street from the hotel there is a large SUV parked and it looks like the passenger is throwing up. \n\nOk, its close to the hotel and i go give it an eyeball to see if there is an issue. When i get there not only is the passenger tossing cookies, but the driver is also purging her cocktails.\n\nSo i call the front desk person...\n\nME: Security to Front Desk. Can you contact law enforcement and have them send a deputy here. \n\nFD: Umm ok, whats going on?\n\nME: There is a black SUV (read off the tag number and provide description of the driver and passenger) that is parked on the side of the road across from us. Both the driver and passenger are outside the vehicle throwing up. I strongly suspect they are intoxicated. I would like to see if the deputy could convince them to take a taxi home instead of drive.\n\nFD: Where are you located? Are you on the property?\n\nME: Yes, im on the property, front parking lot, left side of building.\n\nThere is a pause of several minutes and im assuming she is on the phone with the dispatcher until i hear something behind me. I turn and look and the FD person is power walking towards me.\n\nME: How long did they say it will take to get an officer here?\n\nFD: Oh, i didn't call yet...\n\nME: What...what? You didn't call?????\n\nFD: Im gonna go talk to them...\n\nShe then proceeds to walk over to them and is saying things like \"are you ok? do you need a room for tonight?\"\n\nWhere the driver and passenger then hurriedly got into the very large SUV and drive away fast.\n\nFD comes back to me and says \"well, i guess they left...\"\n\nME: What the fuck did you just do? Do you realize you now have a drunk person on the road driving a 2 ton killing machine!!!!!\n\nFD: I thought id offer them a room...\n\nThe amount of stupid still makes my brain burn to this day...\n\nTLDR - Drunk driver across the street from my post, I ask via radio for the front desk to call law enforcement, front desk person comes out and confronts the drunks causing them to speed away and possibly causing an accident and also abandoning the front desk\n\n\nEDIT to add TLDR and clarify information\n\nSo i have read the comments and even received a few messages about this. Im not sure if i didn't clarify enough so here it goes:\n\n1. Yes the vehicle was OFF property. The were parked in a pre made drive that will go into a new business when the area expands more but currently only leads to an empty lot.\n\n2. I asked the front desk person to contact law enforcement because i was keeping an eye on them and documenting information and if i used my cell phone it would have illuminated me and they would have run.\n\n3. My goal was NOT to get them arrested. It was to get them to take a taxi home. Since they were both outside of the vehicle the law enforcement could not get them for drunk driving as the driver was not in control of the vehicle (sitting in the drivers seat with the keys in the ignition) so i knew they would force them to take a taxi or call a friend.\n\n4. the front desk person decided on her own to NOT call law enforcement and abandon her desk to come out to the parking lot where i was at. I did not ask her to come out only to contact law enforcement.\n\n5. She decided on her own to make contact with the drunks and in doing so caused them to leave at a high rate of speed.\n\n6. They did not get drunk on the hotel property. There is a large mall with several bars and food places that serve alcohol and its most likely they came from there.\n\n7. The hotel was a giant fuckfest of stupid. Management had the attitude of if they ignore it long enough then it will go away or fix itself. I have caught a manager stealing several thousands of dollars of food from the kitchen several times and they still kept their job. Ive caught several employees screwing guests and other employees, in fact one housekeeper had a room they would constantly keep marked as \"dirty\" and they would use that room as the communal sex room. After all was said and reported, i was removed from the hotel for causing problems...go figure.\n\n\n",

If a mouse farts, you bet I'll be there to note down its name, address, time of flatulence, and ambient wind speed and direction. \n\nWhen any people-moving machinery (escalators, travellators, elevators, etc) stops working for any reason, our procedure is to take note of it, safely remove all persons, and restart it before returning to the office to review CCTV and determine a cause (usually some kids pressing the stop button, or some idiot riding on the rail and it automatically shuts down).\n\nThis one day I'm returning to the office to fill out some paperwork when I notice one of the main descending escalators has stopped working. So I waited for everyone to step off before restarting it. Following that, I took out my notebook and begun writing down the time, escalator number, and observation.\n\nWhat I didn't notice while taking my notes was a \"Can I Speak To Your Manager\" descending the very escalator I had just turned on. I was just finishing off the entry when I'm interrupted by an earpiercing shrieking noise, coming from a horrific short haired beast, reeking of alcohol and wearing dark glasses indoors.\n\nCISTYM: WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?\n\nS9 \\*looks up, confused\\*  \n\nCISTYM: IS THAT ABOUT ME!?  \n\nS9: Uhhhh....

        "author": "throwaway501_208",

        "text": "So I posted about the three stories I'm going in a thread on r/AskReddit last night and I thought I would come over here and share them in more detail. I spent about 4 years working at a casino. While I was there I ended up managing a team that handled traffic throughout the property, parking, and outdoor security. We had a lot of crazy things happen, but for the sake of this post I'm going to stick to this parking garage that seemed to be cursed. It didn't always have the most intense incidents, but weird stuff happened in there all the time. Sometimes it was homeless people moving a vehicle in and trying to live in it, other times it was finding people having sex in the stairwells or parked vehicles, and other times it was people using the view to watch concerts for free. All the routine stuff. That said, these three incidents stand out to me. Now that I've been away from the company for 3 years and have no plans of going back, I'm comfortable sharing them because it won't be as big a deal if somebody figures out where it was. The first one is a medical emergency, the second one is a situation with the bomb squad that ends sort of humorously, and the last one is sort of tragic. Be warned, the first and last stories are sort of depressing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory Number 1:\n\nI went through a period where every time I trained a new hire we had a medical emergency of some kind. It lasted about 6 weeks and happened to 4 or 5 people that I trained. The one that stands out to me the most is when I was training an employee named Brianna that transferred in from another department. We got to the end of the shift and had wrapped up everything I needed to cover with her. We still had some time left and the weather was nice, so I figured we would swap out the Explorer we were using and run a couple of the golf carts that had been parked for a while. By this point, the bad luck I was having with training days was pretty well known. She made some joke about how we were 15 minutes from the end of her shift and it looked like we were going to break the streak.\n\nWe left the office and were just sort of ripping around the property taking a last look at things. I was letting her take the lead so that I could evaluate how well the training had stuck. The last portion of the property we were going to check was the parking garage. When we got to the third or fourth floor, I saw somebody laying in the middle of one of the driving lanes. I stopped my cart and called dispatch on the radio to let them know I would be making contact for a possible medical emergency and to get medics on standby. When I walked up, I found an old woman, probably in her mid 70s, collapsed on the ground. When she fell, her head hit the concrete. She had obviously fractured her skull. Blood was running out of her ears and pooling on the ground under her head. She was complete unresponsive. I got on the radio and told them to dispatch medics to my location immediately. I later learned that she was diabetic and her blood sugar had crashed causing her to faint. While this one seems pretty mundane it's one of the situations that came up in the garage that really stands out to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory Number 2:\n\nI was going about a typical, slow Sunday when I got a call from the Tribal PD that they needed assistance in the parking garage. They informed me that it was an issue they couldn't discuss via radio and would be calling my cell with further information. At the time I was at my office about half a mile away working on some \"classroom\" training for a new hire, so I radioed one of my guys to head over to the entrance of the garage and wait for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I got there, we headed up to the 4th floor and met up with the tribal cops. They informed me that one of the housekeeping employees had been emptying trash cans in the stairwell/elevator and found what appeared to be a bomb. They let me know that a bomb squad was on their way out, but a local one wasn't available so we were waiting on a team to get there from about 2 hours away. In the meantime, they needed help clearing guests and employees out of the garage and securing the area. We also reiterated to everybody involved not to mention any details of what was going on via radio (or at all to anybody that was not directly impacted). I sent my trainee and the other guy I had on shift to make a thorough sweep of the garage and remove anybody that they found. While they were doing that, I got on the radio with the valet department (they operated out of the first floor of the garage) and told them to shut down, clear their team out of the garage, and to try to reduce the impact on customers that tried to retrieve their vehicles. I then called their supervisor on his office line (he was  former Air Force Combat Control/Para Rescue so I knew he could keep the information to him self) and let him know why I was shutting them down and asked him to meet me on the scene to set up an a way to safely get valet vehicles out of the garage and into alternative parking so that they could return to semi normal operations out of our office\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n.Once my trainee and my other team member returned I staged the experienced one inside the stairwell with the device (he had volunteered to be in that position so that I could keep an eye on the trainee and handle any necessary communications). He was tasked with making sure that if somebody made their way in there they were removed from the danger zone as quickly as possible. I placed my trainee 20 yards south of the big, glass doorway housing the elevators, stair well, and the device. She was tasked with keeping a visual on the doors at the other end of the garage and making sure nobody wandered in as well as directing any traffic down and out of the garage. I took position directly west of the doorway where I could keep an eye on both of them and keep a visual up and down the ramps to the floors above and below us. I also sent the valet supervisor back down with my patrol vehicle to block off the driveway leading into the garage. He got in touch with another vet in his department who graciously offered to come assist me as a message runner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApproximately an hour and forty-five minutes passed and things were going great. We had a few minor issues, but everybody had done a good job not mentioning what was going on over the radio so we didn't have to deal with any panicked guests or employees, and, aside from the director of security and the head of public safety for the tribe, the higher ups were completely unaware of the situation. We had an unofficial \"Don't Tell The Executives About Major Issues Until After They Were Already Over\" policy because they had a tendency to royally fuck things up. Their intentions were always good, but it was one of those \"too many chiefs and not enough Indians\" situations. When the bomb squad arrived, it was a completely unmarked vehicle. If you didn't know any better, you would have thought it was just a heavy duty utility vehicle. Unfortunately, my guy in the stairwell was the first person to get eyes on them as they pulled onto the property. Without thinking, he keyed his radio and said simply \"The bomb squad is finally here\". He knew what he did because after a brief pause I could just make out him following it up with \"oh fuck\". Que my phone blowing up, the radio going crazy, and texts pouring into my phone from my manager, our director, and our VP. The bomb squad had destroyed the \"device\" (which turned out to be a heater core from a care and a wiring harness stuffed into a box) hours earlier and I was at home in bed, but I was still getting phone calls. At the time I was pretty pissed off, but looking back on it I can't help but laugh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory Number 3:\n\nDon't read this one if you have a weak stomach.  One day in the winter of 2014,  I was standing outside having a cigarette with one of my team members that was also a good friend of mine when onne of my limo drivers came walking up with blank look on his face. I asked him what was wrong and he told me that somebody had just jumped off of the parking garage. I thought he was joking (he said dumb shit like that all the time), but went to check it out anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe guy was dead when I got there. Pieces of his brain and skull were scattered in the rock flowerbed around him and blood was pooling up all around. We had to secure the area  so that a full investigation could be done. Basically we needed to confirmation that he jumped and wasn't pushed. That should have been an open and shut case that consisted of just looking back over the surveillance footage, but unfortunately he happened to jump from one of the only blind spots on the entire property. From start to finish, the investigation took about 5 hours due to local PD and the Tribal PD having a pissing match over jurisdiction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was about 20 degrees and the time and sleeting like crazy. The conditions made what was already a really terrible situation exponentially worse. We had been in meetings earlier in the day, so rather than being dressed for the weather we were all decked out in \"suits and boots\". It was absolutely miserable. Finally, the investigation wrapped up and they were able to move the body. Unfortunately, the temperature had continued to drop after the sun fell (down to probably 10-15 degrees). Because of how much time had passed, we had to bring in one of our landscapers with a bobcat to scrape the remaining blood, bones, and brain matter out of the rocks where they had frozen. That is the part of this ordeal that sticks with me more than anything else. Seeing him just after he had jumped wasn't pretty, but watching pieces of what was a human being just a few hours earlier scraped off the ground with heavy equipment was a lot harder than I would have imagined. Every so often, I have dreams about it or it will just pop into my head when I'm laying in bed or going about my day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day, I was talking to my manager and found out that this man was the brother of one of our high rollers. He had a drug problem and had been MIA for about 6 months. They later learned that he had lost everything and was living on the streets. Between his situation and the long period of cold weather, he finally broke. He came into the casino with his last 5 dollar bill and played it in a slot machine just hoping to catch a break. When he didn't, he walked outside, took the elevator to the top of the garage, and jumped. He didn't even hesitate. His brother was in the casino at the time. In reviewing the footage of him inside to piece together exactly what had happened, it was discovered that they had actually walked each other on the gaming floor. His brother  didn't recognize him. This was by far the darkest situation I have ever been a part of that didn't relate to my own life. And thus ends the saga of our cursed parking garage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, working in a resort and casino environment is a lot of fun. Every day is a little bit different. I had a lot of really cool experiences, I experienced some things that completely changed my outlook on the world and human nature, and I gained plenty of skills that have proven invaluable to me ever since. I'm not sure whether or not anybody will find what I've posted here interesting or not, but if you do let me know. I have quite a few more stories from the place, and a lot of them are much lighter in nature. I few that come to mind are the time a valet attendant told me he was high on acid while at work, the time that one of my team members and I had a completely dead night picking up OT so we built snowmen and chased coyotes, and the time we discovered a dead body inside of an RV parked on the property. Those are just a few that come to mind right here in the moment, so let me know if you'd like to hear some casino tales.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I left the casino in 2015, I was pretty burned out on dealing with people in that capacity. The past few years I have been working in an unrelated industry and going to school, but I've grown to miss it a bit. I've got an interview Thursday at another casino as a part of their surveillance and non-uniformed security team. It's time to get back to having fun and get some new experiences.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Formatting\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "So my last post was about my ex who worked as a concierge at the same Swanky Hotel I worked security at. In this story, we have the same mentally ill homeless man that's in my \"you're a burned bitch\" story. He was affectionately called \"Crazy Willy\" by our local police officers and had some fixation with the hotel. The concierge in question was kind of a stuck up, white bread type of guy. He had some chip on his shoulder about security, a real talk shit until you need something type of person. He was also a massive pussy. He would get flustered by the smallest of guest complaints/altercations and didn't hesitate to call us every time. \n\n\nOne cold, winter night, Crazy Willy walked in the front doors of the hotel, through the lobby, and down into the massive rotunda at the bottom of the grand staircase. He started taking off his many jackets, all the while talking to himself and trying to engage other patrons. I think that at some point he walked up behind a guest and whispered something about jesus drinking virgin blood in their ear. Just typical Crazy Willy stuff. We get a call from Pussy stating that Willy had entered the hotel and had a weapon. \n\n\nA different agent went to escort Willy off the property, so I got to watch it all unfold on camera. Willy went willyngly enough (not sorry), and I watched as the agent walked him back up the grand staircase and through the lobby. When I pan to the camera above the concierge desk, I see Pussy crouched behind the concierge podium hiding from this homeless man. A man who is all of 5'5\" tall and MAYBE 110 lbs. Granted, he was carrying a homemade staff with him, screaming about how Thomas Jefferson used to rape slaves on the steps of the Grand Staircase, but still...this grown man was cowering behind that podium like he was looking death right in the face. \n\n\nAll in all, it was a great laugh for me and luckily Pussy didn't work there much longer and left to go into a much *safer* line of work. I think he's a radio DJ or something now.",

        "author": "OfficerSierra9",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/9e7ky9/the_fire_alarm/",
        "text": "Been a while since I last posted here. So here's another one from my mall cop days.\n\nI'd normally come up with a punchline title, but there was so much happening in this story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore I start, here's a bit of context\n\n**The radios:**\n\nWhile our radios weren't ancient (Motorola XPR 6350s operating on an encrypted digital network), they were definitely showing their age - with only 6 radios shared among the team, sending and receiving messages hundreds of times a day, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, for years on end, they were bound to develop issues.\n\nIt was a requirement for security to wear earpieces so that the general public could not eavesdrop on radio communications on the management/security channel.\n\nThe radios were also plagued with battery issues, so it was not uncommon for us to have to swap out our radios at least 2-3 times a day, which results in increased changes of earpieces, thus increased wear on the accessory pins (manufacturer recommends replacing accessories as little as possible; while we did it several times daily).\n\nAll in all, despite being a vital piece of equipment, our radios were not overly reliable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The alarm system:**\n\nThe site uses a standard Fire Indicator Panel &amp; EWIS combo, located in a locked room, accessible only from the exterior of the complex on the main street.\n\nWhen a sensor has activated, or a red \"break glass\" switch has been pressed, the EWIS is set to sound the alert tones throughout the entire facility for two minutes before changing to the evacuation tone. So if you don't want the whole centre going into evacuation before you determine the cause, you've got two minutes to haul ass to the panel (also no-running policy except when a genuine evacuation is required).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The story:**\n\nSo there I was, just another day of work, acting as shift supervisor. It was getting a bit late in the afternoon, and all the stores were expected to be closing up in about an hour. I was doing my usual thing of walking around the centre, providing a visible presence and hanging out with some of the staff in one of the games stores, which just happened to be on the complete opposite side of the centre to the fire system.\n\nSuddenly an ear-piercing intermittent shriek comes over the radio. I immediately grabbed my coil tube and ripped it away from my head before my eardrum burst. Shared a WTF moment with the store employees, then went back to our conversation. Little did I know, that noise was an early warning that the fire alarm had been activated, and sure enough, 20 seconds later the alert tone sounds across the whole complex. Oh shit. I left the store and begun power walking like my life depended on it towards the fire panel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuess whose earpiece PTT stopped working at the worst possible moment... That's right, mine.  \nI'm hearing the frantic calls from the (client) duty manager/chief warden over the radio for me, but I can't respond.\n\nChief: Alpha Romeo to Sierra 1  \n.....  \nChief: Alpha Romeo to Sierra 1\n\n.....\n\nChief: Alpha Romeo to Sierra 1 urgent!\n\n......\n\nS3: Sierra 3 to Alpha Romeo - I'm behind Sierra 1 now, his radio isn't working but he's on his way to the fire panel.\n\nBy the time I've met with the chief warden, I managed to disconnect my earpiece and was able to use the radio conventionally. I soon after got a call on the site phone from the Operations Manager, who must have gotten an automatic notification of the alarm. He's asking me for all the details of what's going on, and I told him we don't know, currently investigating, will call back. This was followed by a similar call from the Ops assistant manager. This whole time I'm trying to communicate with the ops managers by phone, the other security guards by radio, and the chief warden next to me, I have customers clawing at me left right and centre, asking what's going on.\n\nFinally, myself and the chief warden make it through the crowds and have gotten onto the main street, heading towards the fire panel with mere seconds before it goes into evacuation, when we're stopped by the staff of one of the outside restaurants. \"Excuse me, could you turn off that noise - it's annoying our customers\". Chief just pushed him out of the way and said \"It's a fire alarm! We can't just turn it off because you think it's annoying!\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuckily we managed to isolate the panel *just* before it kicked into evac. We read the indicator panel and I headed over to the reported source of the alarm. It was actually a vacated tenancy on the main street that some removalists had been working in all day. I could smell smoke, but no indication of smoke or flame to be seen. Quickly double checked that nobody was inside and walked out to the sight of three fire trucks coming screaming down the road. I asked the contractors if they had any idea what may have triggered the alarm, and they said no, that they were outside on lunch when it happened. 10 minutes later, incident declared a false alarm, and I returned to the office to review CCTV and prepare my report.  \n\n\nDidn't take long to determine a likely suspect - the very contractor that I was talking to was using a petrol leaf blower in the area at the time the alarm went off. Then he quickly stepped outside and hid the blower in his truck. Needless to say, I went back and had a very strong word with him about the value of honesty.",

        "text": "*NOTE: The first part was cut and paste from a post I made under the* /r/AskReddit *thread \"****Security officers or Reddit. Whats the craziest story you have on the job?\"***\n\nI have quite a good number of them.\n\n\\#1. Two awesome things happened to me while providing security for the 2013 Florida-Georgia game:\n\nThe first ordeal involved me checking bags when this beautiful southern belle (a Bulldogs fan) came up to me with a large duffel bag of a purse with a tiny Confederate Flag\\* on her purse strap.\n\nOur conversation went like this:\n\nYours truly: \"Oh my goodness! I love your Confederate Flag! It is so awesome!\n\nCute southern belle: (with a hint of a southern accent) \"Oh, thank you!\"\n\nYours truly: (leaning in closer and very flirty) \"You know, I have a Confederate Flag in my room.\"\n\nCute southern belle: (grabs me and kisses me on my cheek!)\n\nYours truly: (mesmerized by her kiss) \"You're good....you're good....\"\n\nSad part was I didn't get her name...\n\nThe second fun part of the 2013 Florida-Georgia game was when I had to stand on the field to make sure no drunks were climbing onto the field. Out of the corner of my right eye, I notice two football players tackling the ball on the sidelines nearly tackling me! Needless to say I was on the replay, and I have become quite a legend among my fellow Bulldog fans for being the guy whom was nearly tackled on the sidelines!\n\n\\*So anyone knows, my admiration for the Confederate Flag relates to its historical importance in regard to the American Civil War. I do NOT advocate racism or hatred.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#2. While working at a local distribution center, I came in the truck gate one night to witness my fellow guards and I were taking part of a sting! Part of it was surreal, part of it was bad ass. Knowing that we're going to take down a criminal whom had been breaking into cars in the parking lot made it thrilling. I was the guy given who had been given the task to flip the switch and open the gate allowing the officer sent to help us. While we did not capture the perpetrator, It felt awesome to have been part of a sting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3. Same job, different day: I came in another time to see one of my supervisors came down to the truck gate saying to me, \"You've got to see what we saw earlier on camera!\" Not sure what to make of it, my supervisor plays back the camera were we see this homeless guy TAKING A DUMP IN THE BUSHES NEAR THE EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE!! And yes, you could literally see that this homeless guy left a big pile! My supervisor and I had a big laugh though we were grossed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#4. During my first ever security job at a rundown motel located in a very bad side of town, (which I do not list on my resume because the company was very shady as it was fly-by-night, under the table), I was not being paid on time. After calling my \"supervisor\" (a stupid ass punk bitch) at the time asking for my money and not getting a reply, my father had enough and took matters into his own hands. Called the punk ass bitch of a supervisor and cussed him out saying, \"I am no fool! I will sue your ass if my son does not get his money!\"\n\nThe next day, I get a call from the punk ass supervisor calls me up and I will never forget this as long as I live:\n\nThe punk ass bitch \"supervisor\" says, \"Oh, you gonna sue me! Come on! Ooooh! Yeah!!! Sue me!!!\"\n\nThe more I listened in, I kept hearing this big burly voice on the other end commenting on his \"tight end\". Then it dawned on me that the PUNK ASS BITCH SUPERVISOR WAS HAVING SEX WITH HIS BOYFRIEND!!!\n\nI was very disturbed by this and still am, to this very day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#5. *Note: This one story comes from another post I made two years ago under the subreddit* /r/creepyencounters *called \"****Creeper at the Quik-E-Mart\".***\n\nNOTE: I should have titled this \"Creeper at the Convenient Store\".\n\nI have been a security officer for several years now. I remember at my first security job (which was a fly-by-night pay under the table job), I was asked to provide security at a motel in the downtown area of where I live. It was a very run down place, but that is not the point.\n\nAnyway, in conjunction to the motel, there was a small convenient store. To put this in perspective, I was told by my \"supervisor\" (who was really a piece of shit punk whom I could not stand) to watch over the convenient store before moving on to the motel.\n\nThe store was not very big. It was just a place where patrons could obtain food, laundry detergent, and any other supplies. At other times, people from the public would drop in a shop around before heading off.\n\nI normally bade customers farewell and to have a good night whenever they left. However, one time I began to ultimately regret saying anything. Here is what happened.\n\nOne person, whom to this very day I can still remember what he looked like and wore. His attired consisted of a denim jacket, jeans and a button up shirt with a blue bandanna in his long, brown hair.\n\nNow, before I knew this guy was a creep, I said the usual, \"Have a nice night.\" farewell and that is when things went sour.\n\nThis guy instantly comes back to me and tells me all sorts of weird things. Among the things he says to me include but were not limited to, \"I got these boots from the police!\" or \"I am out to stop these crack dealers!\" and something along the lines of, \"I am like a ninja!\" to which he pulls his bandanna over his face. Now this guy was truly whacked out. Hell, he even had one of those pocket bottles of whiskey! (I think it was Captain Morgan.) Plus, his eyes looked as though he were high on drugs or something.\n\nAs this guy was talking, I was like, \"Yes.\", \"Okay.\", \"I see.\", \"Sure.\" Deep down I am thinking, \"I got to get away from this jackass before he drives me crazy.\"\n\nFortunately, this guy whom was very big shows up. I only stand about 5 feet 5 so this other guy (not the creeper mind you) showing up was a blessing in disguise. With the Creeper Dude distracted by this big guy walking up, I instantly bolted into the store. Looking outside, I see the Creeper Dude walk off in his drugged up fashion all the while staggering.\n\nNeedless to say, for the rest of that night, I was on edge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#6. Here's a fun one! Once while providing security for a Wal-Mart parking lot, I found a bus which had been converted into a hippy bus of old! I am not making this up as there were people on there dressed up as though it was the 1970s. In fact, I even asked if I could go aboard and see what was inside and believe me, it was like stepping back in time! In gratitude, one of the people on board, a guitarist, asked me if he could play a song for me. I requested Pink Floyd's The Wall. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#7. For all you cat lovers out there, I have two stories for you! \n\n\\-While with a co-worker at the truck gate, a stray cat with a broken leg came up asking for food. Being the kind, generous people we were, my co-worker and I gave the cat some food and even called for help. One of the cleaning ladies (at the time) took the hungry fur ball home with her and gave the poor kitty a place to say. \n\n\\-Another time, while in the parking lot, there was a friendly kitten meowing so loudly it was heartbreaking. One of the I.T. guys whom is an awesome friend, took pity on the cat and also homed it as well! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8.  One of my posts involved guarding a truck repair shop. On an eventful night, the driver of a bucket truck drove with his bucket down, dragging across the pavement. The client owner happen to be there that night, and to say he was infuriated would be understating the obvious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9. My last tale from the guard shack includes a rather shocker. One night I go in and my account manager (who is my boss by the way), was speaking to every guard at our account and wanted to speak with me. I was pondering, \"What happened now!?\" So, I go into his office and here is what my boss and I said.   \n\n\nYours Truly: \"(Account Manager) what is going on?\" I hear you want to talk to us about something. \n\n(Account Manager): \"Hey, (LordShadrach), I have some news to tell you.

        "text": "For my side job, I work at a 3.5k capacity corporately-owned indoor theater. We host sold-out concerts of all genres, as well as special events including weddings and awards ceremonies.\nOne night I was working a Motionless In White concert. If you don’t know them, they’re a metal band kind of. I was running gates (making sure only people with certain expensive ticket get into certain area) and a woman comes up to me and starts chatting me up. She appears to be in her 40’s, was pretty, and was decked out in some rather provocative clothing. Tight leather pants, low cut band t-shirt, thigh high boots, the works. Awesome. She was also very, incredibly, absolutely, horribly drunk.\n\n\nAs ridiculous as this may sound being that I work in such a large and chaotic environment surrounded by 3k people every night, I’m not much of a people person. So I was trying to be friendly, but I wasn’t saying much and was a little uncomfortable. Anxiety-ridden, you could call it, but that’s irrelevant. She starts telling me about how she is a female wrestler, which is cool I guess, but the whole time she’s inching closer and closer to me. She’s also taller than I am in her boots, so she was leaning down a bit and her breasts were just hanging in front of my face. She pulls out her phone and starts showing me pictures of her wrestling, all the the while still getting closer and closer to me to the point that she is literally on top of me. I’m probably half her age, I have a girlfriend, and I’m not much of a people person, so at this point my chest is screaming for me to get out of this situation.\n\n\nI try moving away as subtly and politely as possible, but she then comes upon a nude picture and just shoves into my face. She then shows me more, and more, and more. She asks if I like what I see.\n\nNow, again, there are 3k people in the building. It’s loud, there’s strobes, it’s hot and sweaty, there’s kids around. I cannot let his continue.\n\nI politely say, “ma’am I think you should go back to your seat.” She looks rather taken aback but she obliges. No big deal. Just another drunk woman who will forget that ever happened in the morning.\n\nAn hour or so later, a patron comes up to me and tells me a woman has puked all over their row, is coming onto everybody, and just ruining everybody’s good time. I go to investigate and find it’s the same woman. I go to call security over the radio but the supervisor of that floor for that evening waves at me, indicating she’s calling security, and I tell the patron that we’re getting it taken care of, and offered him free drink tickets for the inconvenience. We take care of our people.\n\nMinutes later, security comes rushing up the stairs and grabs her (over-intoxicated patrons are a HUGE liability and therefore must be cut off, removed from the venue, called a taxi, or turned over to police) and starts walking her down the stairs to the lobby. Not sure what they were going to do with her.\n\nFor the next part of the story, she used a lot of expletives, but I will censor them.\n\nThey walk towards me and she catches me eye. She is glaring at me intensely. It felt like the devil was staring into my soul. As they pass, she breaks free of them and gets right in my face. “You f—ing a-hole! You called f—ing security on me! I showed you my tits! Are you gay? What the f—k?” \n\nI explained to her that I, in fact, did not call security on her, but that someone else on my team did. Wasn’t going to sell out my supervisor to this chick because I like my supervisor.\n\nShe then gets closer to me now and speaks very quietly, almost whispering to me. “Have you seen 13 Reasons Why?” she asks.\n\nI am dumbfounded. If you don’t know what that is, it is a Netflix show about a high school girl who commits suicide and then sends out tapes to 13 different people, explaining why they are one of the reasons she committed suicide.\n\n“Uh... yes?” I say, absolutely bewildered.\n\nShe then pulls away, starts walking with security, and yells over her shoulder, “You’re one of the reasons, you f—k!”\n\nI spent the rest of the night shaken, but mainly confused. What the hell just happened to me?\n\nSo alas, I am the butt of a hilarious joke at work. My nickname is the 13th reason. \n\ntl;dr A drunk woman tried flirting with me while I’m on my post working. She then puked on some people, and my supervisor called security on her. She thought I called security on her, so she told me that I’m one of the reasons people kill themselves. ",

        "text": "Reminded by a [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/9car11/how_many_of_you_get_to_hear_oh_that_other/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) by u/biggie8505 , I want to relate an infuriating case of another officer making things difficult by cutting people favors.\n\nWe all have moments where members of the public challenge our steadfastness with regards to enforcing client rules/policies/procedures. It's bound to happen. A few years back, however, I had a prime moment where someone had actually capitalized on another guard's lack of awareness and essentially asked me to do the same.\n\nFor some context, I previously worked at a large event hub. Tonight's tale occurred shortly after I was transferred to another post, but my experiences at that hub provided me with insider knowledge which becomes relevant later. Before being situated at my new post, however, I was on floater duties for a few weeks. This consisted me of being either on-call or scheduled for a variety of special event projects while my Project Manager arranged for the transition to my new home.\n\nAs it so happened, my weeks of floater duty coincided with a seasonal gathering of groups, in an industry I can't necessarily disclose without further jeopardizing my already limited OpSec. This industry's vendors, veterans, novices, experts, and clients converge on my neck of the woods every year around that time. As a favor to a specific department of my client's organization, we assist in the operation of several dirt parking lots. These lots are in the same general area, and are divided into vendor/over-sized vehicle parking and public parking lots. Both lots have an associated price for entry, but the vendor lots are special; select vendors or other parties involved in the seasonal events could apply for a permit from my client's department. Said permits were usually a savings if the applicant intended to park for the majority of the event season, keeping them from paying to park for each individual day, each time they entered. Otherwise, both lots were manned by a security guard each, who are on express orders to charge vehicles and collect payment on behalf of the client's department in a \"pay on entry\" system. The project actually had some brief, exceptionally clear, post orders, which included examples of the department's vendor permit (and spares which we were authorized to sell on their behalf towards the latter half of the season, with instructions on pricing and the like). Said permit was the only permit allowed for the vendor/over-size vehicle lot, otherwise the guard for that lot was tasked with charging vehicles double what was owed to park at the public lot.\n\nI was very familiar with the pair of industry gatherings hosted at my previous post during this season, and so recognized a wide variety of passes and permits issued by the events and their host venue(s). Naturally, on my first day covering the vendor lot, I spotted a driver attempting to use such a venue pass to park for free.\n\nI stopped the vehicle, with intend to collect payment, when the driver rolled down her window and pointed to her venue pass. I took a look and informed her that such a pass was not authorized at this lot. It was at this point that I heard the magic words, ladies and gentlemen. The driver exclaimed, \"The other guard let me in without any problems earlier this week!\" I challenged her, and asked for a description of the guard along with how long that was the case. The driver, to her credit, was honest and admitted that this occurred every day previously that same week while describing the very same guard I had seen signed in for shift each of those days.\n\nI proceeded to confirm with the client contact that I had interpreted the post orders provided correctly regarding vendor permits, while the driver sat there listening. Once I confirmed that no other vendor permits were acceptable save for those issued specifically by the client's department, I explained what the driver's pass really was: it was a pass specific to the venue her business was invited to for an event at my previous post. That pass authorized her only to park in specific areas of that venue, and only for the express purpose of picking up or dropping off product.\n\nThe driver, understandably, was pissed off at the fact that she did not have a place to park her personal vehicle. She was under the impression that her hosts were providing herself and other vendors with paid parking, and that was what the venue pass was for. After a bit more back and forth, she finally decided to pay the established daily price to park in the vendor/over-size vehicle lot. She continued to do so every day her event continued, but she always had a poor attitude about the matter. I also received word from my other officers that she kept testing them, hoping they would let her in the way the guard on post before me had done.\n\nSpeaking of that guard, she was normally very competent and observant. As a matter of fact, she had worked with me before at my prior posting for a short duration. I brought the incident up to my field supervisors, who looked into the matter. As it turned out, said guard was not aware of the vendor permit instructions. She apparently never saw the post orders prior to the incident, presumably because they were such a rarity for special events on the contract. One of my field supervisors made the following two weeks an exceptionally miserable experience for her.",

        "text": "Buckle in folks, this is gonna be a long one. Apologies for formatting, I'm on mobile, yada yada.\n\nLonger ago than i care to admit, i started working for a security contractor after getting fed up with working retail (that's it's own tale). My first station was at a paper mill's front gate, checking in visitors, applicants, patrolling, all that good stuff.\n\nTo give you an idea of how it was; when I started, the head of security had just celebrated being there for twenty years. His second had been there for fifteen. I ended up working there for just over three years and was still \"the new guy.\" This is to say that they had a very low turnover rate. The pay was very good for the area, the work wasn't out of the ordinary, and we got an almost guaranteed 48 hrs/wk. \n\nThe one issue was the plant nurse. Of course I'm not going to post her name, but since it reminds me of Rocky and Bullwinkle for some reason, she shall henceforth be referred to as Boris. You know that joke about people that dye their hair vibrant colors? About how in nature animals will use bright, vibrant colors to warn that they're poisonous? Yeah, her hair was an eye watering shade of purple.\n\nMy first day I walk into the front gate security office and meet my coworkers, great folks all of them, and am introduced to Boris. The meeting went like this:\n\n\"Hello, I'm cajuncrustacean, nice to meet you\"\n\n\"Hi, I'm Boris, what church do you go to?\"\n\n\"I... don't?\"\n\n\"Oh, you should come down to [her church], I'm sure you'll fit right in!\"\n\n\"I'm an atheist actually.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" (In that tone that sets off warning sirens that would wake the dead from three counties off)\n\nNow, I don't talk about it very often, but suffice it to say I'm a former catholic turned atheist, and about 2/3 of my family wont talk to me entirely due to not being of their religion. So me actually saying this was not an easy thing at the time, but I had been trying to be more forthright about such things. It may seem to have been a bad idea, but as you'll find out, it didn't really change anything one way or another.\n\nFrom then on she was a pain in the ass for absolutely everything. Radio is too loud for her? She's gonna complain. Security truck is parked facing in rather than out? Complaint. Phone rings more than four times? Complaint. Patrolling too often? Complaint. Not patrolling often enough? Complaint. You get the idea. And yeah, those are all actual examples. Everybody walked on eggshells when she was in.\n\nNow, I could go on for a long time about all the bullshit she pulled, but I'll whittle that mighty oak down to the two worst branches.\n\nBranch #1: December rolls around my first year there, and Boris is super stoked about her Christmas vacation. She's taking two weeks off, and she's going to have the two kids she's looking to adopt stay with her for the holidays. She made sure to tell everyone. At length. That this was happening. Every. Fucking. Day.\n\nSo she finally fucks off for a couple weeks, we all get some much needed peace around the place, and get our own holidays off.\n\nShe comes back on the second of January all broken hearted and weepy. See, these kids had been in the system a while, and been split up several times. So while they were with her, she went to check up on them during the night. One of the kids had gotten out of bed and gone to sleep in their sibling's bed. Well, she couldn't have that, so she sent them back and canceled the adoption.\n\nI wish I were kidding.\n\nWhat the literal flying purple fuck.\n\nJust... it still pisses me off.\n\nAnd her exact words were \"I don't want them to grow up defective!\"\n\nAnd people wonder why I say that we should be allowed to slap one person a day, free from repercussions. I'd have used up all of mine for the next twenty years right there.\n\nBranch #2: the plant had three gates originally (main gate, log truck gate, and pick up gate). When they put in a fourth for contractors, I jumped on that like a chicken on a junebug. Guaranteed 50 hours/week (five ten hour shifts rather than four twelve hour shifts), a dollar/hour raise, not having to deal with Boris. It rocked.\n\nGetting on toward my three year mark, the head of LP, whom security answered to, left to work at another plant. Rather than, y'know, HIRING A REPLACEMENT, the higher-ups simply took his duties and divvied them up to other folks. So guess who we answered to now? Fucking Boris. The nurse.\n\nA couple weeks go by before the shitstorm hits, but when it does, the first casualty is the head of security. One of the folks that worked in the server room had locked the keys in the server room at the end of shift. The only keys. So HoS pulls out a swiss army knife and jimmies the door open, grabs the keys, and all is well. Until Boris read the report he filed about it. The next day she called our company office and demanded his removal. Because knives were not allowed. Swiss army knives don't even count as knives. I have butter knives sharper than those things.\n\nThen that weekend a worker came in complaining of indigestion. The EMT on site (the former second and now head of security) gives him some pepto, he goes back to work, and all is well. Until Monday when Boris reads the report she filed, calls the company office, and demands she be removed. Because, get this, \"indigestion is a symptom of a heart attack, and it should have been treated as such.\"\n\nThe week after that I get to work on Tuesday, and about 9am I get a call from my company office to come in at lunch. I'm immediately suspicious, but come 12 I head to the office. My supervisor informs me that Boris called in and said that I yelled at a contractor. An event which never happened. I don't yell at people. But, since she was now the company contact at the plant, they were contractually obligated to remove me.\n\nSo, like the others, I got a new position, which turned out to be closer to home (a particular bank that I posted about before). Our supervisor didn't buy her bullshit for a moment, but contracts are a harsh mistress. At least there were other positions he could send us to.\n\nWithin a month every single security officer at the plant had been removed. And every single reason was bullshit. One was \"bringing porn to work.\" The \"porn\" in question was referring to medical diagrams from the girl's textbooks because she was studying to be a nurse. Another was \"joyriding in the security truck\" aka vehicular patrolling. There was \"playing games on company time\" aka doing crosswords and sudoku during downtime on the graveyard shift, \"unacceptable attitude\" aka telling Boris that he wouldn't work a triple because they were shorthanded, and on and on and on. \n\nWithin another month the contract was sold off to another company. I wonder why /s.\n\nA few years later I found out from a coworker that had a family member working at the plant that Boris had been fired for gross negligence. I never got the whole story, but apparently she gave a worker something that their file specifically warned against. As I heard it the guy came out okay in the end, but it wasn't pretty.\n\nI hope i never meet another person like Boris the Bitchosaurus Rex.",

A few times we even stopped off and got food for a guard.\n\nWell, this night we stopped at a post that we use to train our new hires on. Its a simple post and as long as you remain visible and walk around, you wont have anything go on.\n\nWe pull up and im calling the guy scheduled to work there on the radio and hes not responding. No big worries, some people are not used to using a radio and he might have forgotten to turn it on.\n\nSo my boss calls his cell phone and there is no answer.\n\nWe can see his vehicle parked beside the gatehouse and we can see in the gatehouse and see hes not in either.\n\nNow were getting concerned. \n\nI had keys for all our posts and i was getting ready to open the gate when i happen to see movement out of the corner of my eye. I let my boss know i thought i seen some movement and point to where i seen it.\n\nHe looks and also sees movement coming our way.\n\nWhat we see is a shape staying in the shadows...squat running and ducking ... always staying in the shadows.\n\nSo i got the gate open and my boss is about to press send to call 911 when all of the sudden from the shadows doing a full on ninja roll and coming up in a classic ninja (movie ninja...bad movie ninja) stance directly under an area light is a guy dressed head to toe in a full ninja outfit.\n\nIm talking belt with throwing stars, twin swords across his back, mask covering his face, and he even had the shoes with the toe thing on them.\n\noh, and he even blacked out his skin where the mask didn't cover.\n\nSo hes standing there holding this pose and he recognizes me and goes \"oh, hey there!\" and gets up and walks over to the gate.\n\nThe boss and i are a little shocked at this. \n\nME: Ummm... please tell me your at least wearing your company uniform under that...\n\nNINJA: Well, no... i left it at home.\n\nME: At home? You understand we issued you a uniform for a reason, right?\n\nNINJA: Well, yea...i mean i thought this would be better you know. This way i can catch people breaking in!\n\nME: We are to deter not apprehend. Do you have your security license and company ID on you at least?\n\nNINJA: ...\n\nME: Is it at least in your vehicle?\n\nNINJA: well, no...its at home also.\n\nAll this time my boss is quiet and knowing him like i do he was mad...very mad.\n\nBOSS: You have 15 min to go home and get into your proper uniform and put your ID and license ON YOUR PERSON. If you are not back here in 15 min, dont bother coming back and turn in your equipment tomorrow at the office.\n\nTLDR:\n\nNew-hires first day on the post is dressed as a ninja\n\nEDIT: \n\nA few people have posted they don't believe this happened. You all don't know me but i can assure you this did happen. I have been in security for a long time and i have seen so many silly and stupid things. The stereotypes that you see portrayed in the movies or on TV...i have seen first hand.  \n\n",

        "text": "Back in my Swanky Hotel security days, my supervisor received a call from a very scared, very angry woman accusing one of our bartenders of giving out her information. Apparently she had been at our bar the night before with a guy she met off property. They came to our bar for a nightcap and then she was off to the other hotel down the street that she was staying at. She paid for her own drink, and at some point got up to use the bathroom. She got major creep vibes from this guy and booked it out of the hotel.\n\n\nThis is where I came in. I started dating a Concierge (I know, I know) and he was kind of a dick to me and we had broken up at this point. This guy had been working there for a while and rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. He took his job a little TOO seriously and was very quick to anger when he was accused of making a mistake. This is one of the times he took his job way too seriously. \n\n\nI was tasked with reviewing the security footage and speaking with the bartender that served them that night. I was able to receive her receipt with the time stamp, and the bartender's account of what happened. Apparently after the girl left, the guy waited around for a while and eventually tried to get the receipt from the bartender so he could find her whole name. The bartender refused, and that's when he left the restaurant and went to the concierge, as shown on security footage. \n\n\nHe approached my ex and told him this son story about how this girl led him on and then dipped on him at the bar. Being the creep/bleeding heart that he is, Ex went to the bar and TOOK THE GIRL'S RECEIPT. He then proceeded to meet the stalker back at the concierge podium where he logged into his personal Facebook account and looked the girl up. Ex found her and sent her several messages before the stalker left him a fat tip and fucked off down the road to Other Hotel. \n\n\nOnce there, he went to the front desk to try to get her room number, which obviously failed. But they did agree to call the room and let him speak to her. He apparently repeatedly threatened her and screamed at her about leading him on and had to be taken out by the cops. After that, he continued to harass her on social media. This led to her assuming the bar tender had given him her name, and he already knew where she was staying, and ended in harassment. \n\n\nOnce I discovered all of this on camera and completed my incident report, he was brought to human resources, terminated (where he surprisingly didn't get defensive for once and cried like a god damn baby), and I had to escort him off property, which was pretty satisfying to me for personal reasons, but also because holy shit what the fuck is wrong with him? I hate to think what would have happened if stalker managed to find out what room she was in and actually made his way inside. Thankfully Other Hotel was on it and didn't let that happen. Hopefully ex learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of being an accomplice to a stalker. 🤦🏻‍♀️",

        "text": "Just read the post about the bagel shop that was under construction and it got me thinking about something similar. Obligatory \"posting from mobile\" yada yada.\n\nSeveral years back I worked for a contract security company. I was removed from the post I had been at for several years (I could write a damn dissertation about the circumstances that led to that, but tl;dr is that a control freak was put over security at the plant and set about removing *literally* every security officer to the point where my company simply sold off the contract) and was reassigned, temporarily, to a bank that was closing for renovations. \n\nThis was a reeeeally nice building too. Built in the 20s, still had the original stone wall panels and floors and all that. Basically they were rearranging how the offices on the 3rd through 7th floors were arranged and setting up for some new government offices on the 8th through 12th. \n\nNow, it was obvious that the place was closed. The big sign out front was covered, all but one door was locked, there were big signs on the windows and doors proclaiming \"CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION\" in red lettering at, what I imagine was, 512 point font. Then below that was where the other locations were and their phone numbers. \n\nI wish I had thought to count how many people walked in thinking the place was open, but a few come to mind. The worst was toward the end of the assignment.\n\nThe door opens and who should walk in but the most perfect example of a \"I want to talk to your manager\" woman you have ever seen. She looks like you took every PTA and Frankensteined them into one person.\n\nFranky walks in and breezes past me, all the while I'm telling her the bank is closed. I follow her to the closed teller stations before finally getting her to stop.\n\nFranky: is anyone here?\n\nMe: No, as I've been saying the bank is closed for renovations.\n\nFranky: I have business to do, so get someone out here.\n\nMe: The bank. Is closed. There is nobody here that can do any business with you.\n\nFranky: Bullshit, they'd never leave a place like this to a rent-a-cop. So go get them like a good boy or I'll have your job. I have millions with [Bank] so I'm pretty sure they'd fire you in a heartbeat to keep me happy.\n\nAt this point I've had beyond enough.\n\nMe: Ma'am, either leave or I'm calling the cops. It's that simple.\n\nOf course, Franky thinks I'm bluffing. I put in a call to the PD which is literally next door and within a minute I see a car pull out onto the street and into the parking lot. All the while Franky is screeching that I'm lying and just trying to be difficult.\n\nThe officer walks in and asks what the problem is. Franky goes full Alex Jones vein poppingly crazy, shouting at both me and the officer that she would have our jobs.\n\nThen comes the cherry on top. After several minutes trying to calm her down, the officer tells her to leave or be charged with trespassing. She didn't take kindly to that. In what I can only describe as \"modern natural selection in action\" she throws her purse at the cop, hitting him in the face. A cuffing later she's hauled off screaming like a banshee.\n\nOf course I had a ton of paperwork to do over the incident, but it wasn't too bad. She ended up actually calling the bank and demanding I be fired, but by that time the construction had finished and I got a new plant assignment that payed far better than either of the other two and was half the drive. \n\nWent from IDWHL to Instant Karma, and it couldn't have happened to a more deserving person.

        "text": "So I used to work security at a Swanky 5 star hotel in Virginia that rhymes with Fefferson. Management was almost as bad as the stuck up ass clients that frequented the Michelin star restaurant that occupied part of the upstairs lobby. \n\n  \nOne night, after a large party in the lower lobby, the fire alarms started going off. Smoke was visible on camera and I promptly notified the fire department. For a hotel that had caught fire twice before, we did NOT take this shit lightly. As I'm on the phone with fire dispatch, the security line is blowing up with calls from Swanky Restaurant, the front desk, and concierge. Since the other agent had left the office to go meet the fire department, I ignored all other calls and focused on providing as much info as possible to the first responders. \n\n  \nOnce I hung up with strict instructions to evacuate Swanky Restaurant, lobby, and the first 2 guest floors, I was able to tend to the rest of the calls, which ranged from concerned front desk staff to irate restaurant managers screaming about how \"inconvenient\" this fire drill was. Because these managers had some stick up their ass about Security and had taken to degrading us at any given chance (but then turned right around to ask for our help with belligerent guests), I calmly informed them that there was a fire in the lower lobby and while inconvenient, evacuation was necessary because...you know... fire. \n\n  \nThey begrudgingly escorted their guests outside and across the street while the fire department was able to get the fire under control. Once everything was said and done (a whopping 15 minutes of merciless outdoor time for their patrons), my line again blew up with calls from angry restaurant staff regarding the complaints from their customers and how many meals they would have to comp because of this \"fake fire.\" Of course, a complaint was made to the GM about me the next day and the whole thing was viewed as yet another Security failure by the hotel. \n\n  \nDid I mention that because of a previous crime that occurred on hotel property that was made public, the GM (rhymes with Mohseph Dongo) that security was no longer \"allowed to call 911\" I was forced to call emergency services anonymously from my cellphone to relay the location of said fire? I know. Security is the worst. I seriously regret not letting that place burn a third time. ",

        "text": "24+ hour shifter at a dormitory of a uni. Just here to tell about my stupidest night at the place.\n\n-\nThe elephant in the room:\n\nRecently half of our team has been fired due to budget cut reasons, and for better or worse, I made the list of guards-to-keep. The curse of this fact is that half of our team were the 24h shifters, including the guards within the university itself, who were responsible for keeping an eye out on the alarm system of both the big building, and the dormitory. So now on, if there is an actual situation, single lil ol' me has to haul their ass half a kilometer to the university itself, from the dorm, leaving the dorm unprotected, to deactivate the alarms and check whats going on. Not really the safest thing and for a lower-than-minimum wage, I would like to laugh into the face of the PhD certified idiot who is responsible for this bs while making them watch as the university burns down right in front of them.\n\nThankfully the crazy night itself does not end with either place in flames, but indeed very close to it still.\n\n-\nSo one faithful evening, there is a fire prevention facultation in the uni itself kept for the half dead resident students of our dorm.\n\nThe meeting took about two hours before I began to see the hoard hustling their tired afts back towards me, and as I'm giving out the keys like a barista on crack, I notice a bright light in the corner of one of the outdoor cameras. I push myself through the tiny office door, squeeze myself across the dead eyed students, and see a years old pile of trash beside the building catching fire.\n\nGreat.\n\nNo joke, it took one fire truck 20 damn minutes to arrive, and by that time we were pretty worried that the tree next to the dorm would catch the flames too, so I didn't hesitate and grabbed a fire extinguisher to at least stop *that* from happening. One day before fire inspection, no less, principal was pissed.\n\nThat was Incident #1.\n\nBarely five minutes after all of that, one of the students still waiting for their key being handed to them, threw their cigarette into the trashcan outside. First I was brushing it off, it's just a plastic trashcan smoking, no worries. A second in, whoever, I realized that a plastic can that size actually makes a hellova big smoke. Smoke means the smoke alarms will activate. Smoke alarm means a call will come in, I have to run to the main building to turn the thing off, leaving the dorm unattended, with angry student zombies waiting in line for their room keys.\n\noh HELL naw.\n\nImmediately grabbed the janitor key, bucket, fill bucket with water, dash outside, put it out. Success.\n\nIncident #3. 4AM.\n\nStudents being students, especially ones who are aiming at a master's degree, made sure they get pretty hammered each night. This also means that their friends get hammered. And the outsider friends of those friends get hammered. Which concludes that those outsider friends would leave at the very last moment when the very last bus would be coming. Right on, one of said brilliances was so busy saying goodbye to their buddies, turning backwards while his feet dragged their drunk ass forward towards the exit, he smashed face-first into the automatic door. So hard so, that the finger thick plasti-glass door ended up shattering all the way through. No injury, just a damage that would last for 3 months. That door has seen some shit ever since.\n\n-\nThis night meant an entire A4 paper's worth of report for these 3 cases, and believe me, there were many more smaller accidents to follow it ever since.\n\n-\nEDIT: mother of geese I regret putting \"Long Post\" in the title, some you guys have waaay longer posts than mine!",

        "text": "Also posted on r/bouncers but that sub rarely is active these days.\n\nI used to work in a large for my area sports bar that turned into a hip hop dance club type scene on the weekends. I worked initially with a team of 7 and a floating head of security. I worked there for about a year and a half. It was my first bouncing gig and i loved every second of it. I have posted some of my stories on this sub from that bar. \n\nAnyway. I switched to another bar in the same relative area of the town for about 2x the pay and half the problems. I have had nothing but a great time at this new bar not only because of the pay but the lack of issues as well. There is no DJ or club, they don't serve food, no pool tables, capacity is at 100 people vs the 400+ we would sometimes cram in to the other bar. And overall the attitude and vibe of the customers and other workers are all something i fit in rather well with. \n\nBut here is my main fucking problem. My head of security. We work on a two man team at this bar due to its size. We have a fill in/back up guy who takes a shift or two a month when one of us needs to call out. Or comes are works with us when there is a major drinking holiday. But for the most part its just the two of us every weekend.\n\nNow this head of security is a pretty good OLD SCHOOL bouncer. Meaning he can fight. Been around the block for about 15 years. And had the arrogance to show for it. But recently he has been getting repeatedly injured from crashing his motorcycles. And drama with his girlfriends and seems constantly stressed out about his other jobs throughout the week. \n\nCurrently he has a broken arm in a sling. Which to me means i'm working with hardly 1.5 bouncers. In case shit really goes down i'm the one thats going to get the brunt of the damage in the fight. \n\nBut this isn't necessarily my issue with the guy. My issue is that he is hardly ever working when he is there. \n\nI joked with my head bartender for a couple weeks now that he doesn't work for 3 hours each shift. (7 hour shift) and pretty much fucks off the entire night. \n\nLast weekend on saturday out of sheer boredom and curiosity i opened up a stopwatch on my phone the second i walked in and started working. I would start the stopwatch any time that my head of security would go wonder around outside, smoke a cigarette, talk to his biker buddies, flirt with girls, chat up his other friends or potential clients for tattoos, or go outside and sit on a fountain we have out there while he didn't check IDs, i would also run it while he played games on his phone while there were customers that needed to be checked in. \n\nFrom the minute i walked in at 7pm to the time we got the last customer out after last call at about 1:30am my stop watch was at 3 hours and 1 minute of him not working. I had told my head bartender and my fill in bouncer who was there drinking what i was doing that night. And gave them both the results after last call. They were both shocked but honestly not by that much. I was more shocked with how accurate my prediction had been about him not working for 3 hours each shift. Like literally it was on the dot. \n\nNow fucking off that like during a shift would be one thing if he did work when he wasn't fucking off. But all of that burden falls on me. Running head counts, checking restrooms, picking up glasses. While also observing the crowd and checking peoples IDs ad they come in. Ya know... my fucking JOB DUTIES. And he has such a cocky arrogance and air of superiority every time he talks to me. \n\nI just don't get it and i honestly don't know what there is to do at this point. Every one else who works at this bar is aware of the bullshit he does every night. And most of our other employees don't seem to like him that much from what they tell me. But the owner of the bar is somehow a different story. I can't directly call him on his shit for fear of losing my job. But i'm planting the seeds of proving that i am an asset to the bar and am completely capable of being the head of security when he eventually either leaves or gets fired. \n\nTL;DR my head of security fucks off every night for 3 hours of a 7 hour shift. And i'm heated about it. ",

        "text": "Hey everybody! Seems like my last two stories did relatively well on this sub. So now I shall share the story that somewhat bridges between the first story and second story. So I guess it’s a prologue to the sequel, it takes place maybe 15 days after my first shift and the incident at the resort.\n\nSo here’s the context. I was posted at a new site, it was a rock quarry off of a very busy and major highway in my province. This rock quarry was run by a very large construction company and the quarry also included a small lake. It was too big to be considered a pond but definitely not big enough to have a name like “Lake something or other.” It has two pathways leading to the lake which are surrounded in thick trees and bushes.\n\nWe were hired cause people would enter the site, vandalize equipment, then go for a swim in the lake with maybe a spot of camping afterwards. They’d leave butt tonnes of litter behind and dump stuff in the water. Then they’d jump off this huge rock formation that overlooks the water, break bones and then try to sue the company that owns the site for liability even though they were trespassing. Oh and along the path there were numerous notices stating no trespassing but we all know signs are useless against humans.\n\nThe site has two entrances, the first is walkable or driveable, and the second one is only wide enough to walk on or to take a dirt bike on. The total length of the first path leading up to the lake was about 3-4kms, it had an active railroad track running through it right before the lake and the path was covered in sharp rocks you’d find normally surrounding a railroad track, so we had a company van onsite cause the company was not about to start paying people for blown tires on their cars. This van was the worst in our fleet, it had 550,000+Kms on it and the suspension was nonexistent. I still remember how much fun and terrifying it was to take it off site to top up the fuel. It had reflective security decals all over it in massive red letters, no way anyone could miss it. This van met it’s demise at this site and was promptly stripped for parts when the contract ended for the winter.\n\nSo here’s where the story begins. \n\nIt was about 01:30ish in the morning, my shift was 20:00-08:00. I had just finished my hourly mobile patrol in the company van and parked at the entrance of the site on the first path, my personal vehicle was also parked at that entrance. It was the dead of night and very little light surrounded the ground around van from the full moon. I shut the van off and was texting my girlfriend who was just about to go to bed.\n\nI had a strange feeling about this shift, I knew something was going to happen.\n\nI heard a twig snap outside in the bushes. I flick on the headlights and completely roll down the window. I grabbed my trusty Maglight which needed new batteries that evening so the light was slightly dimmer than usual. I looked around with the light outside and seen a baby raccoon coming out of the bushes with mama raccoon. I smiled and rolled my window almost completely up.\n\n02:00 rolls around. Almost time to do another patrol. I grab my clipboard with my site report on it and I was planning to write down when I was going to conduct the next mobile patrol. I like to try to stay ahead of the game.\n\nSuddenly the forest which has been chirping with the sound of crickets all night goes incredibly quiet. My ears began to adjust to the creepy level of quietness. \n\nI hear footsteps, to the left of me. I turn to my left.\n\nI see a male teen next to me, hunched over creeping up to my window. My heart began to race with a mix of rage and fear, and that fight or flight reflex kicked in. I then proceeded to make the dumbest and most unprofessional decision in my security career. I grabbed the Maglight and busted that drivers door open so fast if he was any closer I probably would have knocked him flat out with it.\n\n“BACK THE F*** UP BOI OR YOUR GONNA GET A SMACK IN THE JAW” I yelled out from deep in the diaphragm. The forest then filled with the sound of his terrified scream.\n\nNow I know the way I responded was completely unprofessional but I’m not going to make myself sound better instead of telling the truth. I’d like to say I have matured greatly since these early days, but I know I still have work to do. Back to the story.\n\n“Calm down buddy, what the hell are you doing here in the dark?” I asked bloody pissed off with him. He’s shaking in the dark, I can smell alcohol in the air where he was standing. He’s trying to catch his breath to answer. Meanwhile I pulled out my phone, dialed 911 and put the phone in my pocket so they could get my location.\n\nI genuinely installed fear in him. I’ve never ever done this to another man in my life. I’m 6 foot 1 but I’m lanky, I don’t look strong at all. But that night I was wearing the company jacket which I love cause it makes me look bigger than I am. He also couldn’t have been taller than 5 foot 7.\n\n“I just wanted to see if anyone was in there, I didn’t know you were security” he answers. For a moment I’m speechless, I’ve turned my flashlight off at this point and I turn to the van “what the hell does that say there?” I asked angrily and of course he said security. \n\nThen I hear another set of footsteps running away down the path.\n\n“STOP THERE! IT ISN’T SAFE FOR YOU TO GO THAT WAY!!” I shout to this person who turned out to be his stupid retarded girlfriend, his words not mine. He sat down on a nearby cement block to catch his breath, I was getting into the van to chase her before she got hurt. This next part I’ll never forget as long as I live.\n\n“Yo man you got my anxiety going, how are you gonna scare me like that.” I was gobsmacked. The nerve of this kid.\n\n“How bout you and your anxiety take a moment and go f*** yourself.” I said just before I got in the van.\n\nI started it up, slammed that big dirty thing into reverse and pulled the worst J-turn I’ve ever done in my life. The “suspension” fought so hard to keep this goofy minivan from rolling as I pulled it around. Flipped the full beams on and drove down the pathway. I got all the way to the lake and didn’t find her. I figured she hightailed it on the rail tracks. As I was driving around, I kept talking to myself with rage. I could not believe he had the nerve to say I scared him. I returned to the entrance and he was gone.\n\nGreat! Now I look like a moron. Seconds later the cavalry arrives. 4 municipal officers, must have been a dead night I thought. I quickly briefed the Sergeant on what happened and they insisted they do a search of the site, fair enough.\n\nThey took off down the path at a speed of a rocket, I could not keep up with the company bucket. They searched high and low, found nobody. So we went back to the entrance and they chatted amongst themselves.\n\nI walked to the Sergeant and asked “So do you think I’m alright here?” I was kind of nervous about finishing the rest of my shift here. The Sergeant turns to me and word for word says “Don’t worry kid, if they are still in there, the coyotes will pick them off. You’ll be fine and they’ll be happy.” \n\nAs much as I wanted to laugh and feel better, I could barely crack a smile. I slunk back to the van and did my best to fill out my site report with a shaking right hand.\n\nThis is why working in the dark is so nerve racking for me. ",

        "text": "I originally posted a short (and not terribly well-written) version of this story a few years ago. Then, just a few months ago, I gave the story a *massive* overhaul and posted it on the \"Let's Not Meet\" sub for creepy non-fiction stories. On LNM, it received over 1,100 upvotes, had reddit gold donated and was featured on several creepy story podcasts. \n\nThe story is no longer on LNM as of today, due to [a slight difference of opinion with the LNM mods](https://www.reddit.com/user/possiblyapigman/comments/972vlz/shadow_banned_on_lnm/). As a result, I'm giving the story to you fine folks over here at Tales from Security! Enjoy!\n\n...\n\nFor a very dark five-year period in my life, I worked in what my employer called ‘Healthcare Security’ for a professional term. This is effectively a polite way of saying that my employer was a private contractor who rounded up a lot of local goons to serve as poorly trained (and oftentimes incompetent) ‘Security Officers’ for numerous local hospitals and other ‘Healthcare’ facilities in our city. The job description stated that we protected the entire campus of whatever facilities we were contracted to work for, and that was true to an extent, but the vast majority of the job took place in emergency rooms and psych departments. Daily assignments involved direct face-to-face interactions with drug addicts, chronic alcoholics, homeless people, individuals recently released from prison, violent criminals injured in conflicts with the police, and most notably, psych patients. Oftentimes the people we confronted fell into more than one of the aforementioned categories.\n\nIn addition to the dangerous patients we dealt with, many of my own coworkers at the security contract company were LNM worthy material themselves. Hypothetically, to work for this particular company, you had to pass a background check, a drug test and obtain a “Merchant Guard License” from the city. I occasionally had access to the background check results of some of my co-workers and it was rare to see anyone get hired with what I personally would have considered a “passing” result. Over the years I witnessed a number of people get terminated for some really bizarre sexual assault and/or harassment situations, among a wide array of other generally unprofessional behavior.\n\nLuckily, the facility I spent the most time working for was one of the “better” ones, and they actually had a very well-designed security program in place. The Security Program Manager whom I worked for was a retired U.S. Army artillery officer and a retired federal law enforcement agent, so he knew his stuff. To the best of his ability, he chased away the more obviously unethical or incompetent security officers, although the company would just keep sending more of them no matter how many he got rid of. The hospital itself was a Level 1 Trauma center, and when it came to dealing with physical injuries they were great. Psych patients? Not so much.\n\nEvery patient (and visitor) entering the hospital emergency department was searched for weapons. To achieve this, there was always a minimum of two officers in the emergency department. One officer was inside the emergency department itself, searching patients who arrived by ambulance. The other security officer ran a security checkpoint for anyone who came in under their own power, be they a patient or someone seeking to visit a patient. The checkpoint had a metal detector for people to walk through and all bags had to be searched as well. It was similar to going through security at an airport, minus the cavity searches and no-fly lists, of course. Additional security officers could be called upon from elsewhere in the facility as necessary.\n\nThis story takes place at approximately 2:00am on a graveyard shift when I was assigned as the security officer in the emergency department. The shift had gone smoothly for most of the night so far, when I received a radio call from the officer at the security checkpoint demanding immediate assistance. There was an obvious tone of panic to her voice and I rushed to the security checkpoint quickly, expecting to be joining in on a fight with some methed-out homeless guy. When I arrived, I was initially confused because everything was quiet and the officer at the checkpoint was just standing there, quietly examining something on the desk.\n\nOn the desk in front of the security officer, I saw three bags, and I quickly realized that whatever was happening here it was going to be a more cerebral experience than the typical homeless brawl. \n\nThe bags I saw were of the following types;\n\n1. A Nikon camera bag. I recognized the type of bag as being similar to one a photographer I knew carried. A bag like this often held a camera which could range in price from between $500 to $2000 or more.\n\n2. An extremely expensive leather briefcase, of the type that someone might use to carry both a laptop computer and a large stack of documents.\n\n3. A weather-proof “storm case” of the same brand that we had used when I served in the military. Cases like these often held expensive electronic items or weapons. \n\nIt was a unique set of luggage to encounter in a hospital emergency room, but that alone wasn’t what made the situation so shocking…\n\n**All three bags were completely coated in multiple layers of blood!**\n\nWhen I say “multiple layers” of blood, what I mean is that there were clearly some different patterns in the blood that had ended up on these bags. Some of the blood was already dry and flaky, as if it had been there for awhile. Some of the blood was damp and had a sort of “matted” texture to it, as if it had recently been rubbed onto the bags from some other surface. But most disturbing, there were small droplets of blood which were still obviously wet and looked as if they had dripped onto the bags within the last few minutes. Whatever the source of the blood was, it was immediately obvious that these bags had been exposed to that source over a prolonged period of time.\n\nNaturally, I asked what the hell happened here.\n\nThe security officer at the desk was nearly speechless, but she attempted to explain to me that a moment before I arrived, a man had run into the building screaming and ranting. The man, like his bags, was completely covered in blood from head to toe. She wasn’t able to understand most of what he said, but she recalled him mentioning a dog and someone kicking down the doors of his house. When she asked to search his bags, he also admitted that there was a gun in the weather-proof case. Not knowing what else to do with the man, she sent him through to get checked in and kept his bags at the desk. That was when she called me, hoping I would know what to do next.\n\nAssuming that a situation this bizarre and blood-drenched must involve some kind of crime being committed, I didn’t want to open any of the bags and possibly contaminate evidence. But we couldn’t just let massive quantities of blood sit out in the open and frighten other patients either, so I grabbed a red bio-hazard bag and placed the three blood-soaked items into that bag to contain the mess. Then I contacted a supervisor, which seemed the only logical course of action.\n\nThe supervisor for that shift was a friend of mine and a generally laid back guy. After explaining what I had been told and had witnessed myself thus far, he agreed we might need to call the police to report a possible crime. However, for better or worse, hospitals have to abide by some very strict privacy laws pertaining to patients and what we can share with law enforcement about our patients. So it was decided we needed to at least talk to this blood-covered man and get a more coherent story out of him before taking further action.\n\nConfronting him in his room in the emergency department, we were surprised to find that he was neither screaming nor ranting as he had previously been described. (A later review of CCTV footage would confirm that he had been more animated when he first arrived.) He was completely calm. This actually made his demeanor even more disturbing, as one does not expect a man covered in blood to be calm. He proceeded to very confidently explain to us that he had “tripped over a dog” at his home, because “the little bastard likes to hide under blankets!”He insisted that the blood, which he admitted was an extreme amount, was from a very tiny wound on his head that he sustained after tripping over the dog. He may have hit his head on either a chair or his TV, he wasn’t sure which one. He claimed that after being injured, he tried to lay down in bed but the blood from his head had soaked all the way through a pillow without stopping, thus convincing him that he needed to seek medical attention.\nWe didn’t really buy his story, but we weren’t cops and our power was really limited to enforcing hospital policies on our own property, so we didn’t feel like we could directly accuse him of lying to us. But his assigned nurse confirmed for us that the very minor laceration on his forehead would not be sufficient to cause the amount of blood we were seeing on him and his bags. Furthermore, as he was behaving in a completely calm and coherent manner with strong vital signs, he had no signs of significant blood loss, which further cast doubt on his claim that all of the blood was his.\n\nOur next question for the man was why he felt the need to bring so many bags with him to the hospital when he clearly felt he had an emergency situation (this was a round-about way of asking why he brought a gun with him). His response was that he lived in a very dangerous part of the city and his house had recently been broken into. All his windows had been smashed out and both the front and back door of the house had been kicked down. As such, he couldn’t secure his home at all when he wasn’t there and he felt that if he left his “valuables” at home, then the thieves would come back while he was gone and steal everything he had left. Hence he had decided to bring all of his most expensive items (camera, computer and gun) with him when he left the house. He even went off into a side story at this point, claiming that someone had recently robbed him of $50,000 worth of antique silverware. Even though his stories had taken a turn from merely suspicious to outright bizarre, we kept pressing him, and our next question was if he would be willing to let us put his blood-drenched bags back in his car in the parking lot. We will usually hold pocket knives and other small items for people, but firearms and expensive items we would have to lock up in a safe, which we didn’t want to do in this case because everything this man owned seemed to be perpetually covered in blood. So our usual procedure in situations “like” this (but typically less bloody) was to ask people to take their items back to their car.\n\nOh no, we couldn’t do that, the man insisted. You see, the windows of his truck were broken out too, so the truck wasn’t secure either. In fact, the doors on the cab of his truck were broken in such a way that they didn’t even stay closed on their own, so he had to chain them shut to keep them from flying open while he drove. By this point the story had morphed from being suspicious, to being bizarre to finally being outright disturbing. A man covered in blood had literally just told us, in an eerily calm demeanor, that he has a habit of chaining doors shut. We couldn’t resist the temptation to step out into the parking lot to inspect his truck for ourselves.\n\nIt wasn’t difficult to pick out which truck he had been talking about. It was an older model Chevy pickup truck, with badly-worn white paint and a large pile of garbage in the bed of the truck (including open alcohol containers). As he had described, the drivers-side and passenger-side windows were missing and the doors were indeed held shut with some kind of elaborate jury-rigging involving chains. Inside the cab of the truck, someone had ripped out large sections of the dashboard, leaving electrical wiring and mechanical components exposed. We later confirmed from CCTV footage that this was the truck the man had come from before entering the hospital.\n\nBut as with the bags and the man himself, the most disturbing thing about the truck was the blood. The entire interior of the cab was drenched in even more blood than the man and his bags had been covered with. As with the bags, the blood seemed to be in layers here too. Some of the blood had already dried and was beginning to flake. Some blood was thick and matted, still damp but quickly drying. A lot of the blood was still clearly wet however, including droplets that were falling from the roof of the cab and a large pool of blood which was forming in what appeared to be a small storage space in the center console. The most notable thing was the massive wave of blood which appeared to have been splashed onto the interior of the windshield, directly in front of the steering wheel. I have no idea how that truck got into our parking lot, because it should have been impossible for anyone to drive with that much blood covering the windshield.\n\nThere was some blood on the exterior of the truck too, but in much smaller amounts. It was smeared in small streaks all around the vehicle, as If someone had walked in a circle around the vehicle and intentionally smeared those small streaks in random locations. Aside from that, and some natural looking wear and tear, the vehicle had no other obvious exterior damage.\n\nAt this point, we notified the charge nurse for the emergency department and she called the police to report the situation. It must have been a slow night, or the police were just very interested in seeing this for themselves, because multiple officers from the local police department showed up only a few minutes later. The first thing they wanted to see were the bags. I put on gloves and removed them from the red biohazard bag. The police looked at the bags, but that was all they did. They refused to open them or touch them at all, because they said the situation wasn’t enough to give them probable cause to search the mans property without his permission.\n\nNext, the police spoke with the man. Their conversation went largely the same way that the conversation my supervisor and I had with the man earlier had gone. He repeated the same story about tripping over a dog, his house being broken into and bringing his stuff to the hospital to safeguard it, all told in the same eerily calm demeanor. The police didn’t seem to believe the story any more than we had, but they didn’t accuse him of lying either. They didn’t even write anything down. They asked for his address, which he gave them, and then they said they would have to contact the police department which had jurisdiction over the city where his address was located. While they waited for a response from the other department, they went out to examine his truck and seemed as baffled by it as we had been.\n\nA short while later, one of the police officers spoke to us again to notify us of the outcome; The other police department where the man lived had checked their records to see if any crimes had been reported at the man’s home or if he had a prior record, but they found no evidence of any wrongdoing.\n\nAnd… that was it. Everyone just dropped it. There wasn’t even going to be an official report, because they said there was nothing to report. My supervisor and I were mystified. We knew the local police were notoriously lazy and often unhelpful, particularly when it came to writing reports, but this was the most outrageous thing we had seen them ignore by far.\n\nI flopped down at the security checkpoint and started writing my own report. At the very least, I wanted to make sure we covered our own asses by showing that we had done our jobs, investigated this to the greatest degree we were allowed and made every effort to report a possible crime to the police. Luckily, it was quiet at the checkpoint at this time of night, so I had plenty of time to assemble a detailed report, with images of the blood drenched man and his truck attached to the report.\n\nWhile I was still working on the report, the man was discharged. He had cleaned himself up slightly, but his clothes were still stained with large quantities of blood. He asked for his bags back, and I hauled them out from under the desk to hand them over. Before leaving, he declared that he needed to “check the serial number” on his weapon before leaving. He opened the plastic case right in front of me and without taking the weapon out, he showed it to me in plain view. It was a beautiful 1911 handgun, completely clean, no blood on it or inside of the case, and the whole setup looked like it was brand new.\n\nThen he slammed the case shut, took his bags and disappeared back into the night from whence he came.",

        "text": "Hey everybody! Got another story from the resort. This one takes place a couple of months after my first shift and wild night at the resort. Now a bit of context, after that first shift, the shaky start kept getting worse for me, but that’s a story for another time :P\n\nSo I’m working the afternoon shift 17:00-00:00, I believe it was mid-September when this happened cause the days were starting to get a bit shorter and I was my calmest when the sun was out. The sun was setting so it was probably around 19:00 during my patrol.\n\nI was walking around outside and I seen a middle aged couple walking their big fluffy golden on the driveway in front of the main lodge. The owner of the resort doesn’t care about dog walkers on site so we don’t even approach as long as they stay off the wooden walkway connecting the buildings together as it’s not really safe for pedestrian traffic yet.\n\nI usually do talk to the dog walkers so I went down to say hello and give the good boi some pets.\n\nSLAM!!\n\nI turned around in a second after I heard what sounded like a large door slamming on the back of the building, I said “what the hell was that?” The dog walkers said “Guess you gotta get back to work” I asked them “you didn’t have anyone else with you?” And they said they didn’t, just the dog.\n\n\nI ran back up the front steps and pulled out the trusty maglight from my pocket. I really gotta get a holster for that thing. I ran inside the front doors and I held my breath for a moment.\n\nThis main lodge has the ability to let sound really travel as the walls in most of the rooms aren’t up and the furniture has been removed. If you can control your breathing, you can hear footsteps on the farthest exit from my mostly closed off office. \n\nSo I was holding my breath, and I hear laughter, multiple laughs from at least 2 children on the second floor. Now I’m kinda creeped out, but I stop listening to my mind which is overthinking everything. I run upstairs and the laughter stops. \n\n“Why is it so quiet?” I thought to myself.\n\nSLAM!!! SLAM!!!\n\nThe sound of the door slamming rang like gunshots throughout the building. I walked down the hallway and found the culprit. It was an exit leading to the rear that was slightly jarred open. I checked outside and didn’t see anything. I pulled it shut till the lock latched. \n\n“It wasn’t even a windy day” I tried to apply some reasoning to this incident instead of letting my head run away with wild imaginary ideas. \n\nNow in the area, there is a few chalets with families still staying up there. I’m sure they have children. At the time I kept trying to tell myself that it must have been the way sound travels inside. But I’ll never know for sure cause the cameras inside that building didn’t catch anything.\n",

        "text": "It’s 2014 I separate from the military. Looking for any job really to get my self up and off of unemployment.  \n\nFor all those people who keep spouting BS about how things not being true.  When you separate from the military. You are allowed to go on unemployment like anyone if the lost their job.  \n\nAnyways I find a job working for security.  Cool simple enough still have my certificates like CPR, First Aid, and AED (Automated External Defibrillator )\n\nI go to orientation and get my guard card, and all that setup.  We are given a lot of company information and customer information.  Basically the security company is hired to secure buildings for other companies.  Common thing. \n\nI get my first post and it’s real relaxed people are friendly staff is friendly I like it.  Everyone is doing their job well.  Feels good for once i don’t have to stress about my workmates being bastards.  \n\nA few weeks go by we lose someone on my shift.  Damn! ok, they were great.  I wish them the best.  A week latter we get a new guy.  Let’s call him marshmallow. \n\nLet me tell you this I wasn’t prepared for the poor quality this guy would bring to the shift.  He was slow, backed talked everything, always had his phone out in front of customers.  \n\nThe most off putting thing about him was how he breathed like he was sucking in air harder than a vacuum.  Kinda an exaggeration but you get the point.  \n\nWell looks like I’m going to have to try and be political about this.  I’m his coworker after all.\n\nFirst time I approach him. \n\nOP “Hey Marshmallow could you put you phone away?  I don’t want the costumers to think we don’t care.”\n\nMarshmallow “But I don’t care so what does it matter?”  Breathing like he is trying to keep a small flame from going out. \n\nOP “Listen I know it can get boring here I get that.  I even bring my phone out.  Just not in front of cameras and the customers.”\n\nMarshmallow does a raspberry laugh.  “Listen, you ain’t my Supervisor.  You a security guard like me.  Now go away before I tell HR that I’m being harassed.”\n\nHoly hell what is wrong with this guy.  All I can think is my building will be ruined, because of this guy.  \n\nI should note that our current supervisor didn’t give a flying hell.  He was about to leave and only hand 2 weeks left.  \n\nStart the exceedingly worse behavior.  Soon he started coming into work looking like a slob. He didn’t tuck in his shit refused to wear the radio.  Never had his guard card on him.  Just clear violations for dismissal.  \n\nEvery time I would approach him trying to deal with it at the lowest level.  The response was. “You ain’t my supervisor.”  It was starting to feel like an archer episode.  \n\nWe usually get 45 minutes for lunch.  But we always let each other have an hour.  Perk of being in a slow building.  He started taking hour 10 then, 20, 30.  You get the point.  \n\nHe eventually got to the point where he was taking 2 hour lunches and his reasoning was he had to pray. \n\n2weeks pass the supervisor leaves.  I’m hoping to get someone new who can fix this crap, and I can move on.  \n\nTurns out they are having issues filling the position, and the on in charge of the building is a zone supervisor and he has about 6 buildings to watch over.\n\nHis reply to my complaints is. “I don’t have time for this handle it on your own.”  \n\nAt that point I just say F- it.  I start to look for new jobs.  I come across a supervisors position for the same company.  \n\nMy head starts to click, and I start to think about what I could do if I became a supervisor.  Ohh hell yea!!! Marshmallow you are about to get F’ed. \n\nI apply to the position.  I put my absolute best foot forward.  I even pay to get help making my resume look as good as possible.  \n\nAll the while I start writing down everything Marshmallow is doing on camera marking the date time, and location.  \n\nA few days go by.  I get a call for an interview. I smash the interview like it owed me money.  I get a call the next day and am hired to be the supervisor for the building I already work at.  I start Monday next week. \n\nThe crew hears rumors about a new supervisor, but no clear information.  The rest of the week I hear Marshmallow talk crazy crap.  Telling everyone how the new sup is going to problem be a p*sy.  How he is not going to do anything.  \n\nMonday comes and I come in .   Now mind you supervisors don’t wear a uniform they are allowed to wear regular clothing.  \n\nMarshmallow “All that bitching at me and you don’t even bother to come into uniform man yous a hypocrite.” \n\nI just smile as I walk up to him..  \n\nOP “Can you put your phone away, and tuck in your shirt please.”  \n\nHe looks me without missing a beat says “How man times do I have to tell you.  You ain’t my supervisor.”  \n\nOP “Are you refusing to put you phone away?”  \n\nHe just looks at me for a second and looks back to his phone saying nothing.\n\nOP “Ok.”   I start to walk away heading towards my new office.\n\nMarshmallow “Quit acting like you some important person.  You ain’t any different than me.”\n\nA few hours pass, and I have been on the phone with HR, and the shift supervisor.  I Give them all the information I had, and request to fire him.   \n\nHR confirms he must be fired and escorted out of the building.  When you fire someone at this company you have to have at least 2 supervisors to escort him.  \n\nThe shift supervisor tells me he will help me personally.   He arrives, and he approach Marshmallow. \n\nHe looks up at us and then back down at his phone.  The shift supervisor gives me a can you believe this guy look. \n\nOP “Marshmallow I’m going to need your badge and radio.  You are being let go due to several violations. Gather your stuff and we will escort you out of the building.”\n\nMarshmallow “Is this a joke?  Man get out of my face before I hit you so hard you ass feels it.  You can’t do shit to me you’re not the supervisor.”\n\nOP “WRONG!!  I am your supervisor I have been since this morning, and you’re fired!”\n\nHe looks towards the shift supervisor who only nods his head.  Marshmallow its taken back he doesn’t know what to say.  He slowly gets up and gathers his things.  We are almost to the door, when he turns to us.\n\nMarshmallow “I’m not going to take this lying down I have done nothing wrong I’m going to HR and get you both fired.”  \n\nOP “HR was the ones who said to fire you.  At this point the best thing for you is to just leave, and move on.”\n\nWe got him out of the building and he slowly walked out of sight. Don’t know what happened to him after that. \n\nTl:DR.  Get a job working security.  Co worker constantly breaking the rules.  Using the you’re not my supervisor to justify why he can.  I become his \nsupervisor and fire him. \n\nEdit:clarification. Spelling. Grammar.",

        "text": "Hey everybody! First time poster to this sub here.\n\nI got a bit of a somewhat scary story involving a site I had to guard overnight about a year ago. \n\nSo this site was going to be my very first shift with the company I’m with, just got my security license and just finished college. I was super excited and barely slept for the night shift which probably didn’t help much. I bought myself a brand new 2 D cell Maglight to look all “official” and headed up to the site.\n\nNow the company I work for is somewhat known for sending guards to sites in the middle of nowhere; with, no briefing whatsoever, little to no training from the guard on site as well. So my nerves were a bit jumpy before I even got there.\n\nNow I’m arriving on site, it was a formerly abandoned ski resort now under new ownership and undergoing massive renovations in two of the 3 buildings. It was a very beautiful spot during the day, I arrived around 19:30ish and my shift starts at 20:00 but I wanted to get some proper training before the day guard left. \n\nYeah, like that was gonna happen.\n\nThe day guard takes me around the main lodge, which was almost completely rebuilt but still not finished. But he only took me through the first floor, there is three in this building.\n\nThen we go into the second building, it’s also three floors laid out like an apartment building, but he took me through all three floors. On the third floor it was like a trip back to 1985 with the decor, and every few minutes the fire alarms would beep and say in a terrifying robotic voice “low battery” then again in French. \n\nAll good so far. Now for the third building. “Oh we don’t do interior patrols so don’t worry about it” is basically what he said. Ummm okay.\n\nNow here’s when I had my heart attack moment. I hope you’re still reading.\n\nSo it’s about 01:00, I’m doing my room to room patrol of the second building. I’m getting this strange vibe from it, it’s very quiet, beyond quiet. Like you think maybe you’d hear an air conditioner or a pump of some form humming away but nope. I’m making my way along the second floor, I make it to a room the day guard had neglected to show me cause the door was shut before. It was a honeymoon type suite, it had two bedrooms and a full kitchen. Now I know I should have checked the room hours ago but I was nervous as hell and avoided rooms with closed doors. \n\nSo this door was now opened, so I whipped out the maglight and started to clear this room. I checked the first bedroom, it was immediately to my left as you entered the room. All clear there, I walked towards the bedroom doorway and my flashlight caught something. \n\nA chair, placed right in the middle of the room. It was green leather, belonged to a dining set. \n\nWhat the hell? Why would this just be sitting here, mind you without anything else around. \n\nThen the silence was broken. Running sounds on the third floor. I sprinted up the unlit stairwell so bloody fast and made my presence known with a loud commanding voice, “HEY! WHO’S UP HERE, COME OUT OR YOUR GONNA GET SMACKED.” The adrenaline was pumping and my professionalism was out the door at that point. My nerves are so shot my hands wouldn’t stop shaking, I was drenched in sweat and I am not a normally sweaty guy.\n\nNot a sound to be heard. It felt like an hour before I heard, multiple times crossing over each other. \n\nBEEP! “LOW BATTERY!” “THEN AGAIN IN FRENCH” \n\nIt felt like sensory overload as all these alarms just went off, but then it came  again, silence. Now I was angry, I couldn’t believe I let myself get so scared. \n\nI did room to room checks of every single room, including closets. I found nothing. \n\nNothing. Nothing out of place, nothing missing. \n\nI wrote up my report and had to go get fresh air. The rest of the evening was a nerve wracking mess for me. While I had found nothing, I would have been so much happier to have found something.\n\nI let the day guard know about the incident at 08:00 when he arrived, his response, “oh yeah, that’s normal. It happens to me every time I’m here all day”\n\nThanks for the heads up. \n\nEDIT: u/Omgcorgitracks had a really good question that I neglected to point out in the story. I got to meet the owner of the resort a long while after this incident occurred, I had to stay up there for a week and he came by. He mentioned that a snowboarder crashed and died on impact going down the hill back when the resort was in its heyday. Personally I don’t believe in ghosts, I mean how would I report that :P my bosses would never believe it and probably have me written up for it. The buildings were built in the 60’s but the second building was originally built with only two floors, the third was added sometime during the late 80’s/early 90’s and the snowboarder crashed around the early 00’s. The original two floors were made of concrete blocks but the third is made of wood, it appeared to be done on a budget. I have so many more stories about this place, after I adjusted to being up there alone I quickly fell in love with this site, it’s honestly too bad our contract was never renewed. ",

        "text": "Motorcycle comes into staff parking garage space, stops right in the middle of the lane. 2 get off, trying car door handles. \n\nMyself and my partner, who’s female, were dispatched. We pull up behind the motorcycle. I’ll call the other security officer B. \n\nThey are a significant way down the road from the motorcycle, and as we approach them and pass the motorcycle on foot. B was smart and took the keys out of the motorcycle ignition and set them on the ground. \n\n\nAs we approach suspects, we identify ourselves. Suspect 1 runs back toward the motorcycle past us, B tries to grab him but he slips past. He did find the keys and drove off. We focus on suspect 2. Suspect 2 stepped up and pulled a curved switchblade. \n\nWe step back and give orders and try to reason with him and he makes a few slashing motions at us, and we both pepper spray him at the same time. \n\nI hit him straight between the eyes. B hit everything but him, backdrafted all over both of us. I was struggling to keep my eyes open and she’s squinting a bit, and she goes in and puts the suspect in a wrist lock and starts swinging him around. \n\nHe drops the knife, but she lets go of the wrist lock trying to transition and the grappling match starts. \n\nSuspect takes B’s pepper spray, steps back, and hits her straight across the face, an arch cheekbone to fucking cheekbone hitting both eyes. \n\nThis makes B go crazy, you can hear manly ass grunts (my eyes are barely open so I assume another security officer joined in. I wasn’t handling the pepper spray well). \n\nB goes back for more and gets put in clinch, it was obvious suspect was a martial artist, probably Muay Thai. I’ve called for backup like 6 times already and Im starting to hear police sirens. \n\nShe heel palms, drops from clinch and picks him up, and slams him something out of WWE and immediately drops into being caught up in a closed guard. She’s SCREAMING orders and adding curses I didn’t even know existed, and starts palm striking him in the face. \n\nI go up and try to get her out of the guard and she starts delivering the gnarliest headbutts. Suspect goes night night. \n\nAfter I peel her off, she’s still just screaming. Not a pain scream, but war cry grunt screams. I restrain her, LEOs pull up and I direct them to the suspect. \n\nShe goes from random screaming to directed confrontational fighting words. (Direct censored quote: “Don’t f••k with me, you f•••••g f••••d with me b•••h, I’ll cave your face in c••t a•s b•••h”) \n\nMy eyes are finally beginning to open properly and I can see the arch of pepper spray right across her face mixed with blood from a gash in her forehead. \n\nAfter police friend asks if I need help with my partner, which I decline, I drive her to the ED and they take her and wash the pepper spray out of her eyes and sew up the laceration on her head. \n\nShe was dismissed after the reports were filed, and the saving grace is that when the suspect was brought to another hospital he started spitting, fighting, and biting when he came too and has major criminal charges. \n\nLe end. \n\n\nEdit: B was former security forces in the Air Force, got out after 6 years, currently trains in Krav Maga and Judo, played hockey growing up, and is probably one of the most badass people I know.

        "text": "So here's a fun little story that just went down but first let me set the scene. Picture a side street that streches between three locationsvand ends at the entrance to an underground garage. On one side is my building, a white marble structure that features a short terraced lawn and a patio area filled with picnic tables and benches. Across the street is a massive convention center named Cobo Hall. Their side of the street features loading docks and a short lawn. At the start of the street features a parking lot, a river and an old fashioned riverboat named \"The Princess.\" It should be noted that while the street is a dead end, you can still walk passed the underground garage to get to the avenue beyond and lots of locals use this street as a shortcut to get to and from the river.\n\n Last week it was reported to me that a strange man was seen outside our building via a side entrance. Upon investigating I discovered the strange man was walking down the property owned by Cobo Hall and was headed towards the Princess. I told the person who alerted me to the issue that the strange man was Cobo's problem but id keep an eye out. Well that didn't sit well with the person who reported the issue who then complained that we were all lazy (I'm actually loosing weight because of how much walking we do during a patrol.)  \n\nWell this morning my supervisor came to ask about the incident last week. I explained that the strange man was on Cobo's property and headed towards the Princess. Well my supervisor then explained that the person who alerted me to the strange man complained to the head of security because I wouldn't do anything about it. Lucky for me tho my supervisor understood the situation and I don't get in trouble.\n\nTL:DR, Someone complained to my boss because I wouldn't chase down a random stranger who wasn't on our property.",

        "text": "I've had people threaten me for putting parking violation notices on their windshields when the \"No parking Fire lane\" sign was so close to their car they had to step around it after squeezing out the drivers door (because you don't want to scratch your Mercedes' paint on that rudely place metal sign post /s). I've had people try and attack me because another guard reported their boyfriend to the cops. But today was a new breed of stupid.\n\nThe last few days I've been posted at a place that optimistically (with more than a bit of self delusion) considers itself a casino- And I might believe the claim if I hadn't grown up in a town that made the bulk of its income off gambling. They have a few actual slot machines but most of their \"machines\" are essentially computers that link to a server and you pick which \"slot game\" you want to play using a mouse, when you come in you give your name to the cashier along with a few dollars that they load onto your account, then you sit down and play that amount until it runs out and you  give them more, you play it smart and stop there, or by some act of divine intervention have more money than you started with and decide to call it quits, the third type of machine is more of a problem. The \"Tables\" as they call them are basically an arcade game, for $1 you get 100 points, as you beat creatures you earn points but each time you shoot you loose 10 points, added to this is it's competitive with up to 8 people playing and whoever does the most damage to the creature getting all the points for it. In order to play there you have to have an account- which also involves giving them your driver's license to be scanned and a valid phone number. This means that if you do something monumentally stupid- like putting your fist through a computer screen- they know where to send the bill and the notice that your banned from the building. This also means that if anything happens to come up (like say a customer getting robbed in the parking lot by the guy who just lost $1000) we have videos and all the info cops need to locate and arrest the correct person. A fun night but not really a noteworthy story.\n\nIt's also worth noting this is not in a good part of town, the majority of the regulars are african descent and lack the necessary intelligence to understand not only how to pull their pants above their knees but also that the purpose of a belt is not ornamentation but to hold said pants around their waist. and even the local police tend to have a 10 minute response time despite their precinct being a 6 minute walk away. Unfortunately me being a relatively fit, caucasian male, with a badge and duty belt means I tend to draw the attention of a particular subset of these UPSTANDING citizens. Notably they like to test how far they can push the rules- despite signs clearly stating no food, drink, or phones on or near the arcade tables they will act like it's a new rule when asked to move away with them. I had to physically escort someone out when he decided he was going to walk into the cashiers room \"So he could charge his phone\".\n\nWhich brings us to today, the manager asked one of their regulars to step away from the table while he was drinking. a few minutes later I come back from doing a walk around to make sure there aren't any problems and the same guy is standing with a can in hand. I remind him to step back and he apologises for forgetting and he steps back outside the marked off area. At which point his buddy gets all defensive for him and begins yelling at me about being on a power trip and how I didn't need to enforce every single stupid rule like I was the king. Rather than escalating the issue I simply made sure the first guy was away from the table with his drink and went back to my usual spot standing by the change cage. Unfortunately mister oppressed minority is full of \"righteous\"  indignation and follows me over and starts screaming at me at which point the manager informs him he needs to calm down or leave. He marched out screaming about how I was abusing my authority and would regret crossing him and I shrugged it off as empty boasting and went back to my usual routine of looking mildly bored and trying to stay out of everyone's way after writing up an incident report. I noticed him standing outside on the phone and wrote it off as him calling his ride (because apparently he can afford to drop a few hundred dollars gambling every day but not to buy a car).\n\nAbout fifteen minutes after he's been kicked out for the day Police come bursting through the door. After a rather annoying few minutes during which I got a new set of bracelets and they took away my duty belt before bothering to actually look at the badge on my sleeve and pull my wallet to run my ID they finally apologized and I got to call my Sergent and have him come down to help sort things out. Apparently the idiot was so incensed by me doing my job he called 911 claiming that someone was in the casino waving around a gun and threatening people. What the guy didn't know was that for once a client had gone overboard with security and actually had cameras that actually had audio pickup (not much just five or six feet but when you have one on either side of the door that's a good distance) so after managment pulled them up and the cops verified the phone number that had called against the guys account. They left to go fill out their paperwork while I went through the carpal tunnel inducing paperwork for being disarmed and police contact while my Sergeant took over security duties (my company requires we fill out any necessary reports for an incident immediately after the event or at the end of our shift before clocking out if another guard can't relieve us.\n\nFor his trouble the guy is facing charges for a false 911 call, and I imagine his day got worse as soon as a LEO got within sniffing distance of him. For our part still of him is now pinned to the wall in the change cage above the window money is passed through as being banned for life from the property right along side the guy who got caught trying to mug another customer and the one who put his fist through a screen after flushing away his entire paycheck.  \n\n\nEdit- to clarify a bit it's not that they are african american. It's that they belong to that particular subset of the group who consider it fashionable and classy to wander around with their boxers hanging down low enough to show half their ass, and their pants hanging halfway to the ground despite wearing a belt on them. I've also noticed 9/10 times they smell so strongly of pot I'm pretty sure my proximity to them is going to mean I'll fail my next drug test. That's not to say that similarly attired individuals of other ethnicities are much better in my view but in general it's predominantly that particular group that seems to bring me most of my headaches.",

        "text": "TL;DR at bottom\n\n  So I've been in security for roughly 2 years. Half armed, half unarmed so this job isn't new to me. Anyways, the company I work for has me employed, if you can call it that, at a hospital. 1 guard during the day, 2 at night and I was put on night shift. I'm also horrible with stories so forgive me!\n\n  The night starts off normal and boring. ER patients coming in and out, assistance calls, the usual. Well, at one point a dark sedan parked near a tree in the ER lot and an older woman of like, 65 is rummaging through the back seat for a long time. Longer than normal. I of course keep an eye on her and she eventually walks through the main doors where my partner and I are stationed and she signs the after hours sheet telling us who she is, the time she came in and what room she's visiting.\n\n  We have a pair of double doors we lock at a specific time and if you're going to the 2nd floor you need to sign the sheet and security let's you through the doors to take the elevator up. This woman had other intentions but I didn't find that out until a bit after she is let through. So this woman decides to go to entrance B which is locked after hours as well but you can leave through that door, not enter. My partner spotted her on the cameras and I watched along with her as this woman is on the phone in front of the door pacing. As we watch a somewhat younger and really fat guy walks up to the same entrance but from the outside and she let's him in and the two walk side by side down the hall towards a set of bathrooms. Oh boy.\n\n  My partner and I head towards said bathrooms and decide to confront the woman (W) and guy (G). Now, right across from the woman's restroom and family restroom is house supervisors office (HS) and we get her out here to cover our asses. We knock on the ladies room door, nothing. We scoot over and knock on the family restroom door and we hear is very clear \"HEEEEEY\" from W. She slips out and I start questioning her.\n\nMe: so, where's the guy you let in?\nW: what guy?\nMe: the one you followed to this hallway *points to cameras in the hall* got it on film so don't lie to us.\nW: iunno where he went.\n\nShe was looping us so I just let her go since she wasn't exactly causing serious trouble. After a few seconds my partner opened the door and sure enough, the big guy was standing in a corner on his phone in the bathroom. I ask him the same few questions and he denies them but he throws in he's here to see his aunt.\n\nMe: so you're here to see your aunt. What's her last name?\nG: what kind of a question is that?\nMe: if you give her last name the nurses can look her up and give you her room number to visit. \nG: aight, lemme call her.\n\nFirst off, patients aren't allowed personal items in rooms unless you're a visitor. Second, he came in through a locked door by a woman who lied to us so these two planned a meetup away from security which speaks volumes.\n\n  As he's calling different numbers to try to sell his BS he also starts walking down the hall towards ER. He can't get a hold of anyone and he just leaves but before I could see him off I got a call so I left my partner to it. When I come back she's outside and when I ask her what's going on ahe informs me the guy picked up the woman in his beige pickup and drove off the property. Okay, they're gone, good deal. We inform HS of this and she just asks us yo keep an eye out. Remember that woman's car from before? Yeah after all that happened I decides to inspect her car and sure enough, another older woman was asleep in the car with a chiuaha in the seat being a little demon as I approach. I ask her if she came here with W and she says yes. I inform her that W is no longer here and since you don't have family or friends in ER or upstairs, you're going to have to leave. She cooperates and leaves pretty quickly.\n\n  2 hours later, W is back bit with no ride. We spotted her near entrance B again and confronted her about why she has no ride and she must leave immediately. So she does just that and is out of our hair for the night.\n\nI figured they were either doing drugs or...*prostitution* since they tried to avoid security and both lied to us about why they were here. I'm sorry if this is boring or lame but it's all I've got other than the two autistic guys I had to keep watch over. They literally had autism and were attacking nurses. \n\nTL;DR younger guy and a mummy met up in a hospital bathroom for secret fun times but got busted by security and lied to us.",

        "text": "So in the first part of my story i wrote about how a police officer, who in my opinion was being a bit overbearing, seemed to have a bit of a god complex and according to my sheriffs deputy friend probably needed to hang up the badge. It was his world and the rest of us are just living in it. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/901gbb/dealing_with_police_part_1_the_overbearing_cop/) In this story i'm going to talk about a police officer who had the opposite issue. He was a nervous, probably newer cop, and his incompetence nearly got me, my partner, and definitely himself, killed. I'd like to point out, again, here, that through the countless police interactions i've had, very few go anything like this or the previous one i talk about. These are two of the very few negative police encounters i've had, and positive interactions with police officers are not only a majority, they are usually a highlight of my job.\n\nA disclaimer here: I've signed paperwork that says i'm not supposed to tell you many details about this contract or specific location information, or certain people, etc. etc. blah blah blah, and although i'm certain none of that is relevant anymore, i'm going to continue to abide by that--there's going to be ambiguity in this one.\n\nThe background: I'm working a site at night with a partner (who i can tell you about). It's a big site, owned by people with three letter acronyms. He and i are armed with all the usual stuff: cuffs, light, baton, OC, sidearm (G22 for me, 1911 for him) body armor, and rifles. Both rifles are AR's. His is on him at all times (He's a Vietnam era Marine, so that thing has physically absorbed into his skin, i'm sure) and mine is in the trunk. We have separate vehicles, and we have a large property and three typical entrances to the property to cover. Basically no one is aloud on property at anytime day or night outside of a very short list of people, and EVERYTHING has to be reported. During the day shifts i worked there, i had to log when authorized personnel moved even there own equipment.\n\nIn the middle of the night we see headlights in the distance and when it gets closer we see that it's a police vehicle. I thought he must have seen our headlights on the property and thought something was up, because he turns on his blinker and turns down the private road onto the property. My partner and i go and meet him, both with white light bars on. We stop and get out, waiting for him to come the rest of the way to us. I've got my hands out in front of me in plane sight to not freak the poor guy out, but my partner has his trusty rifle clipped onto his carrier hanging in front of him. It's exactly something a cop wants to walk into, i'm sure. The officer gets out and the nervousness is apparent. He had a face like \"what have i walked into?\" I start thinking about his intentions. He could have been sent out by someone concerned by the headlights, he could have been sent by the site owners, an alarm company, our company, or it could just be what i originally expected, and he just saw the lights and decided to check on it, not understanding he was, for all intents and purposes, leaving the state. We introduce ourselves, identifying ourselves and giving him right off the bat all the information he needs to know. We are security with such and such, authorized by such and such, the site is controlled by such and such, here is our credentials, and unless you have authorization to be here, you are out of jurisdiction and need to leave the property. Right off the bat, we leave room for little confusion. I let my partner take the lead here for the most part because there is really no way a Vietnam era Marine is playing second fiddle to a 20 something FNG (his words. Cool guy, but very direct). \n\nThe nervous cop i guess felt like he needed to do his due diligence, and started asking us questions we weren't going to be answering. We (and by we, again i mean primarily my partner) repeated that these are our credentials, this is who we are, and told him to call who he needs, but he's going to have to do it off property. I guess having been stonewalled and in a situation he was entirely not prepared for, he asked to see our drivers licenses instead. My partner and i express our position that that wasn't going to happen, him more aggressively than me. At this point i'm seeing two liabilities in front of me. My partner really isn't helping the situation with his aggression, and i start searching for a smoother resolution. I restate our purpose there, make sure that there is no confusion with our credentials, try to make it as clear as possible that he is \"off the reservation\" so to speak, and ask him if he has any police business to conduct here. He indicated that it was suspicious for us to be here and reiterated that he needed to see our ID's. \n\nWe both expressed that that was not going to happen, and that he was out of jurisdiction, and again to call his superiors or whoever he needed to but he needed to leave. Again, I say we, but i really mean my partner who is, well, a Vietnam era Marine, and says things in a way you would expect from a Vietnam era Marine...right in your face. This freaked the officer out, and i suggested at this point I can make a phone call to try and settle this smoother than the direction it was currently headed. After all, the police officer wasn't a bad guy, he just didn't know what he was doing. My partner took my suggestion as dissent and doubled down on his behavior. The police officer, now totally lost, tries to establish a command presence, demanding our ID's, and makes what almost proved to be a fatal mistake for all of us. He took a defensive stance and right hand goes to gun. \n\nMy partner reacted quicker than you would think possible for a man his age, and ***DRAWS HIS 1911 ON A COP***. Cocked and now unlocked, finger on the trigger, he starts issuing what are called \"challenge commands,\" which are exactly what you think they are. \"Do this now\" followed by some form of \"or else.\" For those without weapons training it's what usually immediately precedes someone getting shot if someone doesn't back down. \n\nQueue what were probably the greatest \"oh shit\" faces from both me and the cop. What in the ever loving fuck am i going to do now? Draw on the cop? Draw on my partner? stand in the middle? While my partner is beginning to issue his challenge commands, all i can do is try and get their attentions like a dancing monkey in the corner, and i just blurt out something to the effect of \"Ay, Ay Ay, *Woah*!\" At least that was my intention. I'm sure it came out more like an autistic monkey screeching in the corner. No dice. The ball was in the cops court. Luckily for me and my partner, as well as himself, upon the issuance of my partners challenge commands, the cop moved his hand away from the gun. To this day the only reason i can think of that the cop didn't draw is that he knew he had no leg to stand on. (Not condoning my partners actions) We had made it abundantly clear he was someplace he wasn't supposed to be, on a private property, had no police business to conduct here, and had the credentials to prove it.\n\nOnce the officer backed down, my partner lowered his weapon to the low ready position. I remember saying something to the officer that was probably some form of what we'd been saying previously, that he can't be on property, that he was out of jurisdiction, and needed to leave, and then he did. This whole incident took place in probably 2-3 minutes. He left property, and then parked far down the road, i assume making a number of phone calls, and then after some time, he left for good. Meanwhile, i'm on the phone with my supervisor, then my boss, while my partner is on the phone with some other people, and we're both just trying to work damage control and get ahead of this before we have some SWAT team roll in on us or something.\n\nOur regional sergeant came out as quick as he could, and some people for the property, and we did a ton of report writing, legal stuff, a lot of talking to people on the phone etc. I guess communication behind the scenes was established quick enough with the company, the owners, and the PD and the situation was adequately explained, because no SWAT team ever came for us, and we handed off to our replacements in the morning, and headed directly for the home office to talk to the boss.\n\nIn the end i continued to work that contract, though never at that location again, my partner got put on another contract (he ended up having a mental breakdown a couple months later and lost his license, which i'm sure you'll agree isn't shocking), and the police officer lost his job. \n\nThis situation played out how it did because of a number of factors. One obviously being my partner, but the other being the police officer. His demeanor and apparent lack of experience both contributed to, and, in a way, resolved the issue. I think had any other police officer been in this situation, receiving such aggression from an armed individual, they would have drawn on my partner and I. The fact the he did not is the only reason this ended the way it did. The way i figure, it was his lack of control of the situation that lead to this incident. Also, any other police officers would have used his radio to request help, and tried to resolve the issue by using the proper channels and making a phone call, avoiding this all together. Of course, i would like to think most police officers would know when they were entering someplace they weren't supposed to.",

        "text": "In security we often have contact with police, and as i'm sure most here can attest, police officers have varying degrees of competence, just like people in any other job. Some police officers (and luckily in my experience it seems to be very rare) i've come in contact with have no purpose wearing a badge. They either are just plain incompetent to the point of carelessness, or else think it's their world and the rest of us are just living in it. It has helped me in these situations to remember their intentions and not just their actions. Two such instances come to mind. This is the first.\n\nThere was a time i was working a site out in the middle of nowhere, alone at night. I was pretty familiar with this site, as i'd worked it a number of times before. Given the nature of the site (alone and in the middle of nowhere) and also the type of site, i'm almost fully equipped. The only thing i think i didn't have was body armor and a rifle. The site was just off a county road. There was a dirt driveway about 20 yards long connected directly to the county road, crossing a drainage ditch, and meeting an iron gate. On the other side of the gate was a gap, big enough for vehicles to drive around the site, and then a 10ft chain-link fence with wire along the top. Normally i'm parked in my marked company vehicle inside the locked iron gate. On this particular night they had open ditches inside the gate where they were doing construction work by day. Obviously i was under instruction to not drive through the gate and over the ditches, but i was ok to patrol on foot. As a result, I had my vehicle parked on the driveway outside the iron gate.\n\nTo my recollection it was sometime around 0400 when a county police officer drove past and saw me and my vehicle outside the gate. He drove past, flipped on his lights, turned around and pulled onto the dirt driveway, stopping in front of me. At this point i'm already out of my vehicle and waiting to see what he has to say. He asks what i'm doing there and i tell him who i am, who i work for, and who i'm contracted with. I'm wearing my state issued license on my chest as i'm required to do. He didn't seem satisfied. Ok. I understand. It's totally possible someone is impersonating security to access a secure site like this one. It wouldn't be the first time. It's also suspicious that i'm outside the gate. The problem is that there are established procedures to verify someone licensed in security for that state. It's very simple actually. I am required to hand over my security license (pinned to my chest) upon request. It has all the information necessary to identify me through the state. He could also contact the company i work for, or the company we are contracted with and speak with Security Operations. Instead he wants to ask for my drivers license so he can run me for wants and warrants. Despite the fact that he had to come onto private property to do this, ignored any semblance of propriety, and his attitude was honestly just a little too \"this town aint big enough for the both of us,\" I decided he had reasonable enough suspicion to come onto private property, and as i was outside the gate, i would continue to, and it was in my best interests to, cooperate and i gave him my drivers license. \n\nInstead of going back to his cruiser and running my information through his computer, he radioed for it, which i thought was strange until i realized he didn't trust me and didn't want to leave an armed person he doesn't trust while he went and punched information into a computer. While he was waiting for the results, he's asking penetrating questions he has no right to such as how long i intend on being there, and why i'm armed. I'm trying to give satisfactory answers, but without any information he doesn't need to know. I tell him i'm assigned to work nights at this site, that there is 24-hour coverage, and that the contract is for the foreseeable future. As far as why i'm armed, i just told him it was a requirement for the contract. He seemed to scoff at the idea that security should be armed. Never mind the fact that i'd been shot at twice while working this same contract at two separate sites that year. I'm trying to be as polite and courteous as possible because i can tell by his attitude he'd just love to escalate things. He continues to ask questions like i'm some perp, but i'm trying to remember his intentions and not react to his actions. For all i know there have been reports of burglaries, or people impersonating security or something. His questions, though, have devolved into almost personal attacks along the same lines of his questions about why i'm armed. He's asking questions about why my company vehicle and the insignia make it look like a police car. I tell him it's a company car and he'd have to ask the company.\n\nThe results of my clean record come back (after a fashion. Someone on the other end mistyped my DL # and couldn't find me at first which didn't seem to help the police officer in trusting me) and he prepares to leave. I make sure to get his card before he goes, and he is reluctant until i say it's just policy to report police contact and attach a card to the report if possible. It wasn't, but i wanted to attach his card to the report anyway. Ever since, this has been a personal policy of mine.\n\nAfter this encounter i called my supervisor, and started the report. When i'm done, i called a work friend of mine who was a sheriffs deputy for the same county working part time on the same contract, and who happened to be working another site nearby. We chuckled about it a bit and i asked if he had any idea why the officer was so on my case. I was thinking back to his intentions and my thinking that maybe there had been a string of burglaries or impersonations in the area or something. My deputy friend asked for the guys name, and i told him. He said the guy is just a dick who's been doing this for too long. I told my friend (who is familiar with this site also) that if i were on the other side of the locked iron gate there was no chance i would have given the officer my ID, and he agreed. He said if it were him he wouldn't have given him his ID in my case to begin with. I obviously disagree on that last part, but at least we agreed the guy was just being a dick. My boss (a former police officer) also shared similar sentiment and said he would personally be making a phone call to try and make sure any future contact with local sheriffs deputies included checking security licenses for our safety and theirs.",

        "text": "So as this tale includes sensitive information I'm not currently willing to discuss, and to appease the employer, i'm going to keep the location and identifying information vague.\n\nAt the time of this story I'm working at a location in a rough neighborhood. No doubt if i end up posting a bunch of stories, a lot of them are going to be about this job. As far as the backstory goes, all you have to know is that an individual was trespassed from the property, for hostile acts, which won't come as a surprise to anyone after reading this. You should also know that he blames me personally for being excluded from the property even though he got physical with two employees while getting kicked out and neither of them were me (one was my partner for this job and i had to break them up). \n\nAt first he would come back and i would stop him, tell him he's been trespassed, and try to convince him he had to leave immediately or face criminal trespass charges which come with a pair of shiny nickel plated bracelets. Unfortunately it was almost always easier at this location to deal with people this way rather than just call the police, even if they've shown a propensity for violence in the past, because the police weren't coming unless someone was dying. Mostly it becomes just me trying to bluff the guy into leaving, because other than grabbing him, beating him into submission, and throwing him into the street, my options are limited. He would argue, but if i can be permitted to shine my own armor, I've developed some good verbal judo. I get him to leave with nothing unusual to report.\n\nThen he came in one time, and tried the mea culpa method. He's saying things like \"I'm sorry, I was just a little out of it that night, that's not usually me\" just short of begging to be let back. I'm trying to do the customer service thing and say \"I know, i understand, it happens, but...\" but i don't have any say over the matter (and if i did there's no way he'd be coming back in) and i tell him as much. I blow a little sunshine up his butt and tell him if he calls the business and sets up a meeting with management, they'll hear him out and maybe allow him back (never going to happen. You put your hands on security, your done). This put him in an agreeable enough mood so that when he tried to argue if i just let him in nobody would know, all i had to say was no, and he left without incident. \n\nThen it got interesting. He would drive by the property and if he saw me, he would turn around and leave. This went on for a few weeks. From what i heard, he did make it inside on one of my days off, but either \\[Someone i can't talk about without giving away too much\\] or management spotted him and he was removed. Shortly after this, I'm working outside and he drives past me. He turns around in the parking lot, drives up to me on the curb and rolls down the window. Now, from my perspective, I'm not sure what to expect. The last time he and i spoke he was all \"I'm sorry, my bad, won't happen again\" but since then, he's been removed from property, and he'd been driving past me outside and then driving off. I'm still not sure what to make of this. Once he's rolled down his window, i take a few steps forward and ask neutrally, \n\n\"What's going on?\" This is where the hostility starts again. This guy had been the living embodiment of the stages of grief. He started with denial, moved on to bargaining, then continues to sadly drive by all forlorn, and he had now reached anger. \n\n\"You's a little bitch!\" He says with as much vinegar as he can muster, as if I, a security officer who has been called every derogatory and mean spirited thing in the world, am going to suddenly clasp my chest, scream out \"you've wounded me\" and drop dead then and there. *Oooh my feelings*.\n\nInstead i give out a heavy sigh and start to break into my monotonous 'come on man, you know you're trespassing just go away' speech, though more professional than that.\n\n\"Look, you know you can't be here, so...\"\n\n\"Get the fuck away from my car!\" he shrieks, cutting across me.\n\n\"You came to me. You don't want me by your car, then don't come here.\"\n\n\"You's a little bitch! I'll beat yo ass.\"\n\nFor the record, it's good to note that this guy is about 5'3 140lbs and i'm, well, more than twice his weight and taller than most people reading this, and getting physical is often in my job description. It's not going to be a physical issue for me to front kick this guy back into his car, except i don't need the trouble and fallout that would come with it. But seeing that there is going to be no reasoning with this person, and they only came here to start something, i dropped all pretense. My verbal judo isn't going to do me any good now.\n\n\"Just leave! This doesn't end well for you.\" And i go for my radio to let everyone else know where i'm at, what's going on and make sure i have a camera on it for my sake if things go south. For some people simply pulling out the radio is enough. They realize they are out of their depths, there's people on the way, and that there is someone with 911 punched into a phone, waiting to hit call, and they leave after a final meek display of low character. For other people, it just enrages them further. You can guess which one this guy was.\n\n\"Get away from my fuckin' car!\" He says as he threatens to throw open the door, cracking it open like he was going to get out and jump me. I have no reaction to this, because it's like i said, this doesn't end well for him, but also because i know something he doesn't (I imagine there are probably a lot of things i knew that he didn't or we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place but...well...read on). Enough time has passed now that I've finished my Sherlock Holmes-esque analysis of him and my surroundings. No visible weapons, but keep looking. Drunk. High...Weed. No passengers. No seat-belt. Car is unlocked. He's looking to pick a fight. Nobody else outside with me. Expect he has a plan. Radio on my right; check it's turned all the way up etc. I've done this sort of thing a time or two. I'm looking for anything that can help me, and anything that can hurt me. One thing i noticed in this time is that he never put the car in park. Yes you can probably see where this is going from the title now.\n\nHe continues his threats, and i keep telling him in one way or another he can leave anytime he wants, but i work here and am here all night. It's a futile argument. And i guess he got tired of having it because he throws open the door, i think attempting to hit me with it, full of rage, as if I am the source of all evil in this world, and caving my head in would solve the worlds problems. Unfortunately for him, I've had people try to hit me with car doors before and have, as a rule, stayed out of the way of the doors arc. I don't know if it was the fact that i found him to be a completely nonthreatening individual, or the fact that i didn't move when he threw the door open, but he seemed to pause for a moment, left foot out of the car, looking up at me before he decided that it enraged him even more, because this genius gets out of the car. The absolute *mad-man*; He actually did it. He gets out of the car and comes after me. He gets probably two steps out and still i don't move. Which probably would have enraged him still further if it weren't for the fact that his car was rolling away from the moment he removed his right foot from the brake. \n\nYou know those times when you see something, know it's a possibility, but it seems just too good to come true? This was that moment. I'm busting out laughing as he scrambles back to his car, and after negotiating a one footed run on pavement while the other foot is planted on the floor of the car and with a hand on the car door supporting him, he is able to get himself in the car, slamming the brakes, and the door.\n\nThe wannabe tough guy had no choice but to drive off in what i assume would be humiliation. Two other security officers arrive in time for me to tell them there's nothing to worry about and i radio a request for pictures from the security cameras to add to the guys dossier.\n\nI saw the guy a couple weeks later on a property within eyesight of this one. He was in his car facing our property. I stood on the corner of our property staring him down until he left. I never saw him again. If you're out there, thanks for the laugh!",

        "text": "So, it's been a few years but I figure I can share the story of my first night alone, working third shift at a shopping center. I had been training with the other night shift guys for a week and other than a small mulch fire (summer sucks) it had been going great. So obviously things go to shit as soon as I'm alone.\n\nThe night started boring. No one was in the building, second shift managed to lock all the doors, I escorted the manager of the theater to her car, I check the whole property from the security truck and headed in for lunch. Within seconds of me sitting down and opening my soda the phone for our security line rings. The caller ID says restricted... So it's the police. Great.\n\nThe dispatcher asked me if I was aware of any vehicle accidents on the property. I'd just come in from the truck and it was 0300, no one was on the property and no one had any reason to be. So I say no but I'll go look.\n\nJump in the truck and do a lap. And right by the outer ring road on the far side of the building I come on two sedans that are just... Fucked. Wheel off, tyres deflated, airbags deployed, proper fucked. I grab the first aid kit and call the police back to tell them where on the property to find me. Then, while freaking out because I was in no way prepared to deal with this level of anarchy yet, I called out and approached the first vehicle. No body, no driver, doors open... Huh.\n\nI approach the second vehicle and the cruiser pulls up and the officer comes out to join me. Same thing, car's completely fucked but no one's around. What the fuck?  Who called this in to the police and where are the drivers? There is no way they walked away unscathed. I do a quick lap and can't find anyone on our property then I head back to the scene to start documenting. Take photos of the cars, the damage where one went over one of our islands, etc. I also call the 2nd shift supervisor who was the person I relieved at midnight when I came on. He gives me some advice but says unless something drastic changes I should be good not calling the head of security.  Because I was new, I took his advice. Talk to the local cop who I hadn't met before.\n\nSo eventually a second officer arrives and BCI arrives to take photos of the scene. The police call the tow company and they arrive and get the first car onto the back of the truck. Around this time a beat up sedan pulls up on us and everyone gets kinda nervous and defensive until the driver shuts off the car and two kids in McDonald's uniforms get out. The passenger points at the car on the wrecker and says something along the lines of \"That's my car!\" So both local officers, the BCI sheriff, and I descend on this kid. The local sergeant on duty arrives within a minute or two.\n\nThe kid says he wasn't driving, he had lent the car to his buddy Apu (name changed to protect the idiot) who works at 711. The sergeant jumps in his suv to go talk to Apu while the rest of us keep talking to this kid. I am frantically trying to get all the info into my notebook. The local officer who was the usual third shift guy did me a solid by including me and letting me see the kid's ID so had his info for my report. Damn good guy.\n\nWe're a few minutes into this when the officer's radio squawks and he turns to the kid and says, \"Are you aware there is a warrant out for your arrest?\"\n\nKid looks kinda sheepish, \"yeah...\"\n\nSo I take a couple of big steps back to be well out of the way while both this kid and the guy that drove him to the scene have their pockets emptied. The kid gets marandarized and put into the back of one of the cruisers. The guy that drove him is told to head back to work and does. Around this time the Sergeant arrives and informs us that he found Apu at work and he was drunk. Guess we know in part how the accident happened then.\n\nThe second car is hooked up to the wrecker and everyone is ready to clear the scene. The sergeant and cruiser with the now arrested kid head off. The third shift officer turns to me and asks if I've seen an African American male around 14 years old. Turns out he borrowed his grandmother's car and that was the other car involved in the accident. I hadn't but promise to do another full patrol of the property before I go in and write this up. Never did find him.\n\nSo I head inside, write all this up, upload the photos of the incident, and finally have my lunch. Rest of the night was pretty good. No incidents. I tell my relief everything and since he's the first shift supervisor he looks at my report and says it's all good. So I go home and head to bed. After sleeping for maybe thirty minutes my phone rings, it's the head of security aka my boss. I answer and immediately he yells \"Are you trying to get me fucking fired?!\"\n\n\"No,\" I am very confused.\n\n\"Why didn't you call me about the incident last night?\"\n\n\"Well I called Fred and he said it wasn't necessary...\"\n\n\"You don't work for fucking Fred! You work for me!\"\n\n\"Sorry sir, it won't happen again.\"\n\n\"Great report, you did everything right. Good pictures.\" His voice has completely changed, no anger whatsoever. \"Have a good day.\"\n\n... \"You too?\"\n\nWell then.\n\nI eventually got back to sleep.\n\nThat was my first night. I can't believe I kept that job. That remains one of the more interesting incidents for me. And proof of the curse that everyone's first shift there was a shitshow. Mall security does not get paid enough. Names been changed to protect the the guilty.",

        "text": "I should start this by letting you know I am at the very lowest tier of what could be considered security. \n\nI work solo overnight shifts at a resort and double as both night auditor and night security. I have a nice black polo to differentiate me from the green and khaki wearing other staff and my own set of keys and a golf cart but that is it. The owner doesn't think we need two people on property overnight and for the most part he is correct, we only have four buildings spread out over about 30 acres and it isn't hard for a single person to patrol. \n\nSo, getting to the story, last Friday night I had just finished the audit and answered a phone call from a pleasant woman asking for more towels so I locked up the front desk and hopped in my cart with the towels. It was close enough to 0100 that I decided to turn my errand into a security patrol of the property (which I do hourly) so I was taking my time and moving all around the property when I noticed a short woman smoking a cigarette and glaring at me. I gave her a wave and drove on past to deliver the towels. I passed her again on my way back but since she didn't respond, and didn't look happy, I skipped the wave and just drove back to the front desk. \n\n0140 rolls around and on the camera I notice a trashcan in building 4 has either been knocked over by raccoons, the wind or someone careless so I hop in my cart and head that way. It's been about an hour since my last patrol so again I take my time on the way making sure to keep my eyes peeled and drive around every building. I pass the angry lady again while she is outside talking to someone in a van and again she stops and glares at me as I drive by. After righting the trashcan and moving it back against the building where it wouldn't be easily tipped over I head back to the front desk and the angry woman decides she has had enough of me and shouts at me as I pass. \n\n**Angry Woman:** What the fuck is your problem?! \n\n*I pulled into the empty spot where the van was because I know she is talking to me but couldn't hear what she said* \n\n**Me:** I couldn't hear you over the engine, what can I do for you? \n\n**Angry Woman:** I SAID what the fuck is your problem? Every time I come out here to smoke you're creeping by in your fucking golf cart. \n\n**Me:** *Annoyed* Yeah, sorry about that. I'm just doing regular patrols of the property like I am supposed to. \n\n**Angry Woman:** Well you can cut it out! I don't need this kind of harassment! \n\n*She then turned around and went back into her room with her lit cigarette* \n\nIt was a weird interaction but I've had worse, and sometimes when things don't go right for people on vacation they take out their frustrations on anyone they can. When I got back to the front desk I decided to look up the guests information and make a note for our housekeepers that they may have been smoking in the room when I notice some red flags. The reservation was made online in the woman's name and used an out of state address but the copy of her drivers license one file was for a local address. *We don't rent to locals.* On top of that the room was paid for with a debit card. I made the note for our housekeepers and dropped an email to the front end manager letting her know we had a local in house and that she might be trouble. \n\nI only saw her once again while doing patrols that night (and she ignored me) but I was watching the cameras and she had three vehicles come and park in front of her room for a short while then leave after entering. That is the biggest red flag of all and I knew in the morning she was going to get evicted from the property. When 0800 rolled around and the head honcho arrived I filled her in on the nights activities and she promptly began the process of evicting the guest. The morning front desk person decided to show up an hour late so I had to watch the front while the manager and two guys from maintenance went to the room and informed the guest that they would be leaving, I could see from the camera's that she didn't like this and was throwing a fit but it didn't take her long to gather her things and leave. \n\nAbout twenty minutes later the two very excited maintenance guys  came up to the front to fill me in on the details and show me pictures they had taken of the room. Apparently the angry young woman had tried use an empty soda bottle as a crack pipe but it had partially melted. They showed me the pictures of burnt dried plastic adhered to a coffee table and the remains of the bottle. She was ingenious however and decided to use an empty 20z glass liquor bottle instead which she forgot on the mantle in the bedroom when she left. \n\nLuckily at that point my relief arrived and I was able to leave that mess in the hands of the manager.

        "text": "Many years ago i was working for a security company as a supervisor. This company i helped build from the ground up. My blood, sweat, and tears were all over every part of the company.\n\nSo fast forward a few years after the company was started and we are pretty big, were becoming a company that some of the big boys are starting to be concerned about.\n\nMy role as supervisor was i did scheduling, hours recording, payroll, interviewing new guards, training new guards, meeting potential new clients, meeting existing clients, dealing with employee disputes, and many more things i just plain forgot over the years of being gone from that company.\n\nOn the average i would get 2 maybe 3 days off a month if i was lucky. People calling off...if i couldn't get the shift covered by some one else, then i had to do it. \n\nSo my bosses wife hired this guard, lets call him Steve...\n\nSteve started out being a good worker. Coming in on time, coming in if we need a shift covered... got along ok with other guards and clients.\n\nAfter a few months of Steve being employed with us, the Chief of Operations (AKA the bosses wife) had Steve do patrol a couple of times. Ok, no big deal...one of the other supervisors trained him for patrol so no biggie.\n\nI was working a post that was pretty much dead center of our operations area. In between rounds, i was doing my schedule, payroll, dealing with guard phone calls, writing up memos... i was a busy little beaver.\n\nSteve decided to drop in on me and see how things were going. First thing he did was bitch at me for not walking around all the time. he then started listing all the things i was doing wrong and that he could do better.\n\nhe ended his little pep talk with \".. and you need to watch out! I want your job!\"\n\nAs soon as he said that, i reached down to my belt and handed him my gold badge and said \" here you go. Give my your silver badge. Your now a supervisor. Schedule for next week needs to be finished by tonight and given to the guards. You need to verify the hours worked tonight then get payroll done and ready to be sent off in the morning otherwise the guards don't get paid and YOU will have to deal with them. Here is the supervisor cell phone. When it rings, no matter what time of day or night, you HAVE to answer it and deal with whatever issue it is...\"\n\nThe whole time i am telling him this his eyes are growing bigger and bigger and when i tried to hand him that cellphone he backed up and put his hands up and said \"hell no! I didn't know you did all that!!\"\n\nI said \"dude, that's just what i have to get done tonight. I still have post orders to draw up for that new post we got and figure out who can cover a shift tomorrow.\"\n\nHe just got back in the patrol car and left. I didn't have an issue with him ever again trying to get my job...\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hey all, hope things are going good. \n\nI started working security for a huge factory complex a few weeks ago, first ever security job. My rounds consist of walking one of the plants, getting readings from valves and various machines, then plugging them into the computer and comparing them to the acceptable ranges maintenance has given us. \n\nBasically, is this boiler going to explode in the next two hours? Nope? Cool.\n\nAnyway, this is out in the middle of fucking noooowhere. There are quite a few Amish employees. \n\nHere are a couple tales.\n\nThe disappearing cleaning guy:\n\nThis place develops a lot of it's tech in-house, and as such, I have to change the name they use for some of their rooms. We'll call them \"sifters.\" Sifter 3 is basically abandoned and only used as a storage warehouse now. It's a mess; the roof leaks all over the place, there's a layer of dust over everything, old parts are tossed wherever there's room, covered in oil and hydraulic fluid. \n\nThis area also houses the main electrical room, with big Frankenstein switches to turn off some of the biggest machines at the plant, so I always have to go there. \n\nI was coming out of the electrical room, around 2200 or so, and saw this huge, old guy pushing one of those electric floor-scrubber vehicles. I knew no cleaning people should've been in that day, but fuck it, i'm new, I don't know everybody yet. \n\nThe dude was probably 6'6\", 300lb, and looked like he was having a hard time walking. He pushed the scrubber around a corner, I was there less than three seconds later, and he and the scrubber were gone. This area was fairly big and open, there's nowhere he could've gone that fast, especially with that heavy machine. \n\nVery odd. \n\nThe snake:\n\nOne of the guys who trained me had been a Marine. He told me that this area has a problem with northern copperheads, which are venomous. He told me, if you are outside and randomly smell cucumbers, don't be outside anymore. \n\nSo, one night, I was walking the dirt path behind the plant, and I came across a dead groundhog with a very small, precise piece of it's head ripped out. As I shined my flashlight on it, *sniff* ....cucumbers. Yep, bye bye, take 'er easy, snek. (I actually don't have an issue with snakes, but anything venomous, yeah, nah.)\n\nI now call that back path, \"Copperhead Road.\"\n\nThe office doors:\n\nOur tiny office is right next to the hallway where all of the management and HR people are. There are maybe six offices, a front desk, bathrooms, and a little kitchen/break area. There are no cameras in the hallway itself, unfortunately. \n\nIt was late afternoon on a Sunday, I was alone in the plant except for a few maintenance people, and the only access to the management hallway requires passing me. (The door is electric-fob controlled, so if anyone needs into the hallway on one of those days, I have to get up and let them in.) \n\nI was about to call my fiancee for a little bit, when I heard what sounded like one of the office doors slam in the hallway. I looked in through the little window on the door, didn't see a thing. The hallway and all of the offices have motion-sensor lights, and they hadn't clicked on. \n\nI went back and sat down, called fiancee, when there was another slam so loud she heard it on the phone and went, \"what the hell was that?\" \n\nThis time, I looked down the hall, and at the very end, the conference room door was now open and the lights had come on. UM. Welp, time to actually be a guard. I opened the door and gave a good, \"SECURITY, WHO'S IN THERE?\" I got to the conference room, looked around, not a soul. \n\nI don't get it. \n\nHope you guys enjoy.\n\n",

        "text": "Originally posted this in r/nosleep and someone there suggested I post it here. Just because it's from no sleep I swear this is true and can and will provide as much proof as needed if requested.\n\nFirst things first, let me start with I'm no author so this won't be the most amazing story in the world. It doesn't make it any less true though.\n\nSo, I work overnights as security at a hospital. Recently I've experienced some strange occurrences. i.e. seeing movement on the cameras that doesn't show up if I happen to rewatch the footage, hearing people say things when i'm alone in a section of the hospital, etc. All things that could probably just be chocked up to lack of sleep.\n\nWell about a week or so ago I started noticing pretty consistently that i would see what looks like a figure at the end of a hallway almost daily around the same time within an hour and a half (between 02:00am and 03:30am). Last night I waited there for it and took a \\[picture\\]([https://imgur.com/XVV6W6c](https://imgur.com/XVV6W6c)) around 02:20am.\n\nI went immediately back to the office and attempted to pull the footage up to see if it was caught on the cameras. Unfortunately we don't have a closer view of the end of that hallway so the quality is pretty shitty. But I did pull it up and it almost looks like there's a \\[face\\]([https://imgur.com/wKUDkfK](https://imgur.com/wKUDkfK)) when I zoomed in on the doorway at the end of the hall.\n\nAnyway, cut to tonight, I drew the short straw and got stuck sitting in the office all night watching the cameras. Well I decided I'm going to pay attention to that specific camera all night and see if I can catch the figure. 03:30am comes around and no sign of it. I think that's the end of it. At around 03:45 though (exact time I don't remember) I get a call on the code line from a patient room on the fifth floor. \n\nThe code line is a number that staff calls to call a code AKA a medical emergency. I get the call then announce it over the intercom. So not only was it weird that I got a call on the code line from a patient room, it was on the fifth floor. The fifth floor doesn't have any patient rooms on it. It's used to store maintenance equipment, broken equipment, etc. It's a staff floor and is a restricted floor. \n\nWell I answer the call and that's when my blood went cold. When I answered the phone I heard what sounded like a woman choking, begging for help, and crying before the phone went silent. I radioed to the other security officers to check it out but they found no one on the fifth floor. \n\nWhile they were checking it out I called the other hospital in our company. Sometimes people might call the wrong location. But our location always uses 4 digit room numbers with the second number being a 5 i.e. 3501. The room number that called me was 5536.\n\nWhen I called the other location they told me no one was in room 36 on the fifth floor. I checked the security footage to see if anyone had been on the fifth floor and trying to fuck with me or something but there was no movement on the cameras for almost 24 hours. The last time there was a recording on the fifth floor was yesterday at 02:21am. I hope the phone doesn't ring for the rest of my shift...\n\n**Very Minor Update** Last night (this post was copy and pasted so it's not accurate on dates) the fire alarm went off at 01:45am. Tonight the fire alarm just went off at 00:15am. It's most likely coincidental but i figured I'd add it in here.\n\n**UPDATE #2** So I attempted to call the room back last night as some suggested. The call wouldn't go through. Gave me some sort of an error message IIRC. \n\nAsked my boss and a couple other people who have worked at that hospital longer than I have if there have ever been patient rooms on that floor. My boss told me there haven't been as long as he worked there. Most of the nurses I talked to about it said about the same thing. One of the other security officers I talked to about it mentioned he thought there might have been a long time ago (30+ years). \n\nI went and talked to one of the maintenance guys and he said he wasn't sure either. So I haven't gotten a definite on whether or not there has ever been rooms on that floor. But  when I asked him he asked me why I wanted to know. I didnt want him to think I was nuts so I told him I was just curious cuz it seems kinda like a waste to leave an entire floor empty. \n\nHe somehow brought up if I saw someone or something up there. I was kinda silent and he asked if she was female and he mentioned him and most of the other maintenance guys have seen her too. I told him the story. His first response was \"you got balls. If I got a ghost call I sure as hell wouldn't go up there and check it out\".\n\nI'll continue to update as I get more info.",

Much less going on when they have problems with people breaking into units. This is probably the weirdest site I've ever seen and been too in the past 4 years of doing security \n\nThis happened at the beginning of last week where a normal alarm went off (cooking) turned into potentially thousands of dollars in fines. The concierge (not security concierge) just froze up in the midst of everything (but i certainly cant blame him as i just stood there myself because i didnt have any orders to do anything). He also ignored an entrapment too in the elevator. The fire department showed up because i had the phone and didnt know who the monitoring company was.  The biggest wtf i noticed was that the elevators were still operating as normal as i assumed they're supposed to be programmed to stop as the alarm goes off. \n\nTD;LR: new site, lack of post orders or any sort of policies causes them to get huge flak from the local fire department for half a dozen violations which could rack up costing thousands of thousands of dollars.

        "text": "Not sure if this is the best place to put this, but there's no r/talesfromlostandfound.\n\n\nBackground: normally, I'm an IT guy, specifically tasked with running IT for a medical center. Sometimes, however, our security guard asks me to help him out with the cameras we have all over the place. I help him dig through footage, capture footage from the cameras to give to the cops and lawyers, etc. This is how I've come to be involved in criminal prosecutions. I find this fun. It's a nice reprieve from the monotony of my day job, and the security guard's a pretty chill guy. \n\n\nSometimes, when he's not available, I'm also lost and found for our patients when they lose valuable (to them) stuff. Basically, I'll get a call, pull up a camera, and try to find what happened to whatever it is the patient is looking for.\n\n\nA few weeks back, I get such a call. One of our front desk girls calls me, and I hear screaming in the background. She tells me that he security guard is out, and that the screaming lady is claiming that someone stole her phone off the charger it was on outside one of our treatment rooms. I come down to her floor, and, along with the department manager, manage to calm her down long enough (it takes us a while) for her to tell me where the phone was charging, and around what time. Mind you, her's was an hour long appointment, so I have about an hour of footage to fast-forward through.\n\n\nShe had (this is important) sent her teenage daughter on ahead to, iirc, pick her youngest daughter up from school during her appointment. So she waits, I go upstairs, and start looking at the footage. Indeed, someone does take her phone in the middle of the appointment. So I take a few screenshots and download video, then call the department manager and let her know that I saw a person in a gray hoodie and jeans walk towards the phone, grab it, and take the elevator to go outside. At that same time, I assume (since I was in my office 3 floors up,) the daughter walks in, wearing...a gray hoodie and jeans. It's at this moment that the department manager laughs and says \"Wait...Oh my god. That's her daughter,\" and I hear laughter in the background.\n\n\nTurns out the daughter took the mom's cell phone without telling her. Both mother and daughter apologized profusely for making me waste a good amount of time. ",

        "text": "So I used to work for an extremely shady local security company here. I had fun, my checks generally cashed, and they even screwed up my hours one time to the tune of like 1100 bucks in my benefit. I never said anything about it.  \n  \nAt the time, the company had 3 patrol cars. Old police crown vics, of course. The owner was a previous cop who was kicked out in the late 90s for various shady dealings. But in his eyes, it wasn't because he stole, did ghost employment schemes, or worse - it was because he was black.  \n  \nWe had just signed on a new contract. It was a quarry, and because of the entirely gravel roads, he wanted to get a jeep. This owner was such a clown, that he would use his security guards that had other abilities (like car repair) to fix the patrol cars, and have them doing maintenance. All while not paying them any sort of benefit for doing so. One guy who was just desperate for money did a bunch of repairs on the newly acquired POS jeep, and to my knowledge he was never compensated.  \n  \nAnyhow, this jeep was a total shitbox. If it got over 45 mph, it was just uncontrollable. I had to go get fuel for it one night while I was doing patrols, and had to get on the highway - all while never having driven it before. It scared the everlovin bejeezus outta me.  \n  \nThat should be enough context. Here's the real story.  \n  \nAt one point the owner wanted a buddy of mine to take it to the repair shop. I think it was to get a brake job done. Which is good, because the thing had zero braking power. Not sure if there was air in the lines, or what, but my friend said while he could likely handle it - the jeep frightened him. So, the boss was following John in the jeep, and he went to pull into the parking lot of their destination. John couldn't stop, and hit another car. It was a minor fender bender, but still. Here's where it gets fun. Paul, the owner, immediately blames John for driving recklessly and that he was going to pay to fix the jeep and the other car. John obviously refuses saying that the jeep was in disrepair and wasn't safe to begin with. They bicker and apparently the point was taken that John wasn't going to pay.  \n  \nOr was it? John continues to work for the company (god knows why) for a bit longer and Paul starts taking out money from his paycheck. This is known to happen there. He confronts Paul, and is told that it's the cost to repair the jeep (he didnt even really repair the jeep anyhow). So another bickering match ensues, and Paul fires John.  \n  \nSo after all this settles, John files unemployment. Paul contests it, and says he was fired with cause. They even had a hearing and the unemployment people sided with the owner of the company and denied unemployment. Cherry on top is that Paul then sued John in small claims court, it was for like $3000 if I remember right. The judge split the difference and John ended up having to pay $1500 via the court system.  \n  \nMoral of this story is dont trust shady, tiny security company owners. Especially if they change the company names every few years. (this guy did, likely evading taxes is my guess). Well, it's not a guess, last I knew he owed the IRS $800k. ",

        "text": "Sharing this here because it happened at work the other night, though it's only mildly security related. Mostly because of my apparently new \"magical\" cover (aka security hat) and because it happened on shift.\n\nDisclaimer: can't give a lot of details 'cause I work for a company that is very proactive about keeping their secrets with regards to security, but I do grave\\-shift security for a large company. My main job at this time is to guard the main entrance for a large event space and ensure that only the people who should be there are there working overnight.\n\nAdditional details: I'm 39 but look like I'm in my late 20s or early 30s. My joke is that I have a portrait in my attic that ages for me. You know those age\\-guessing games they have at carnivals? No one ever even comes close to guessing my age, and I still get carded 99&amp;#37; of the time I go out to drink. This is relevant.\n\nMy team that I work with on grave shift is pretty tight. We all (for the most part) help each other out, and while we might not all hang out when we're not working, we chat when it doesn't interfere with our jobs. A couple of weeks ago, one of the security officers on my shift asked me to \"find him a girlfriend\" since I'm good at making friends. Of course, it was phrased like, \"So, if you meet anyone who's single and looking for a guy...\"\n\nNow, this guy is nice, but a little weird. Ex\\-army, early 30s, lives with his parents currently, and is obsessed with things that grown men aren't normally obsessed with, like certain Disney princesses. Nothing that would keep him friend being a friend, but some possible red flags if he's interested in a relationship with someone.\n\nBut he's on his own finding a girlfriend. And this is why.\n\n&gt;Saturday night, he wandered up to my patrol area to cover my lunch. After I returned to service, he didn't have any calls (he wasn't assigned to a specific area that night) so he stayed to chat for a few. Because of the heat &amp; humidity where I'm located, I have a tendency to throw all of my hair into a ponytail and stuff it under my hat so it's out of the way when I'm working.  \n\n\n&gt;His comment? \"With your hair like that, you look way older than you actually are. But if you're okay with that...\"\n\nNot just older. **WAY** older.\n\n*He knows how old I am.*\n\nI had to share this story with others the next night when he was off shift... and now my joke is that when I put on my hat, I become a grandma! I take my hat off and I'm young again! It's a miracle!\n\n**But seriously, dude. No.**",

        "text": "Howdy lads, been a while since I could come here with a legitimate story. If you remember, I'm a library security guard, but I've been sitting on a really good one for a few months due to court issues. \n\nCue me checking cameras while tired out of my mind due to a flood of paperwork which took me hours to finish checking over. After a few minutes, I noticed an odd woman, roughly 60 years in age, going from camera to camera and staring up at them while on her cellphone. A little odd, most people don't care about the cameras, but she is paying them a lot of interest. Two or three minutes pass, a new camera, continued staring, move on two or three minutes later.\n\nAfter a short while of this, with me messaging the building manager noting I was stepping out to check on the woman, I find her in the hall where our restrooms are speaking excitedly into her phone.\n\n\"It's true, they've got cameras everywhere, sir!\"\n\nCurious, I decide to make a pass to check outside as if on a normal patrol, though it was quickly made clear my subtlety was entirely unnecessary.\n\n\"There's a guard walking around, several cameras, they're spying on me I think. I'm going to just wait here a while.\"\n\nAt this point, I decide to confront her after informing staff of the odd exchange. As she's on the phone, I decide to stand nearby in view and politely wait for her to finish her call. She continues on very loudly without caring about me, before hanging up her call only to pretend to dial another number.\n\n\"Yes, hi, please put me through to Honorable President Trump.\"\n\nAfter this, I decide this has gone on long enough and point out to the woman I'm waiting to speak to her.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I'm being harassed by a guard right now.\"\n\nShe moves right next to me and continues talking to Trump with no intention of stopping for me. Every time I attempt to speak up to ask her what's going on, she speaks over me. This goes on for quite some time, with me attempting to ask if she needs any help, if she has an issue with the cameras and guards, so on. After some time she decides to start yelling \"SHUSH SHUSH SHUSH SHUSH SHUSH,\" at which point I ask her to lower her voice and warn if she continues I'll have to ask her to leave. This goes nowhere, I warn her several times, then warn I'll contact police. \n\nAt this point, the woman shoves past me and tries to yell at staff that I am assaulting her. She pulls up her clearly powered off phone, threatens to call our local senator, and continues pretending to speak to both the senator and Trump at the same time. Threats are made that she knows a lot of people and that she's here on official business, but no explanation of her actions is ever made and she continues to not allow anyone to speak over her. \n\nDuring this time, I find that she's been barred from the library for months.\n\nWhile the police are coming, she decides to just follow me around and scream obscenities, which I personally approved of as it meant she was no longer disrupting the flow of business at the front desk. I walked outside, she followed, I informed her that police are on their way, she accepts the challenge. It is at this point I receive the strangest mix of lecture and conversation I have ever heard.\n\n\"You need to respect your elders and people in power, you know? It's so rude for you to interrupt my phone calls, I'm talking to a very important man! Yes, sir, I'm still here, I'm giving this young man what for! You know I worked a long time to get where I am and I did nothing wrong, you assaulted me! I'm an extremely important person and I can have your job in an instant! I'm talking to (Local Senator) right now! Yes, sir, they have everything on camera, the guard has paperwork on the issue. You should learn to stay in your place! I'm contacting the white house as we speak! I'm a national spy!\"\n\nThis went on for way too long before the police finally arrive. I relay all the information of what happened, mostly that I was attempting to ask if she had any issues with our security measures or needed any help before she started screaming, as well as the fact she is currently barred until (date). \n\nFrom here I don't have much more to add, she gave the police just as much trouble, offering them everything from her insurance to a postcard instead of her license. Eventually they took this to her vehicle which was (illegally) parked on the side of the road...right next to our parking lot. I was out of earshot at this point, but it took another 20 minutes for police to finish with her, at which point the officer returned with his hands thrown up. \n\nBut lads, I'm sorry to tell you this isn't the end of the story. For the next month, after threatening a lawsuit, she went from library to library in our system, ranting about what happened to everyone who would hear. Police were called on her several more times at each place as she would never leave despite her bar. \n\nAfter an entire month of this popping up at every single one of our branches and main library, her court case finally arrived. I wasn't there nor was anyone from the library, so I have no idea what happened to her, but she hasn't been seen since.",

        "text": "This is a TL;DR of a story I posted over on LNM. [Here's a link to it if you're interested.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/7vv9dy/graphic_makeshift_slaughterhouse/)\n\nSo basically, I was working one night almost ten years ago (damn, does time fly or what?) and I was supposed to drive out to a rather remote storage unit business. The place actually had a closing time and people weren't allowed to access their units during those hours. It was my job to drive out there and check on the office and the units to make sure they're locked up and secured. I went there earlier that night and everything was routine and nothing was out of the ordinary.\n\nThe second time around, however, one of the units was unlocked, which wasn't right because all the units were locked up and secured earlier in my shift. I could've been mistaken from earlier, but I was sure that they were all locked. I had to assume that someone had been trespassing and could be inside the unit, so I opened it up.\n\nIt was a disgusting sight to behold; there was a wooden table in the center of the unit and on the table were the butchered remains of a dead hog. Its innards were strewn about and there was blood on the floor and table. The smell was repugnant and I closed the unit and ran off to my vehicle to write down what I saw and alert the authorities while keeping an eye out for the trespasser.\n\nWhile I was waiting, it took about fifteen minutes before I managed to see the trespasser return, carrying something from a wooded area that shared a border with the unit business. He entered the same unit I had opened up and disappeared inside. I called the barracks again and relayed to the dispatcher a description of the trespasser; Caucasian, probably average build, wearing a black hoodie and black sweatpants. The responding trooper was only about 5 miles away at this point.\n\nI watched on as the man came back out of the unit empty-handed and disappeared into the wooded area. I let the dispatcher know where he went and about 3 minutes later, the first trooper came driving by and they located him walking down the road.\n\nAll-in-all, they found the dead hog, a jar, a large knife, and an empty bucket inside the unit. I learned that the trespasser was actually only 15 years old and had access to the unit because his parents had rented it out for a month but never ended up using it and he had taken the key from them without their knowledge. \n\nHe was going to be charged as a juvenile with trespassing and animal cruelty. He admitted that he had killed animals before, but not for any legitimate purposes (like for food, etc.)\n\nI heard nothing of it afterwards, not even as much as an article on our local news site. Disappointing, but whatever. I would've loved to have been able to provide a link to one and share it with ya'll.",

        "author": "EyebrowsForEveryone",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/8pcgfd/overnight_at_party_school/",
        "text": "This happened Nov 2015\n\nBackground: I was a Forensic Science major at the time and I was looking for an on-campus job -  my first job. &lt;school name&gt; is pretty well known for its party-ness, and has been on the “Top 10 Party Schools” list for quite a long time. I picked this school not for the parties, but for the academics (I am an introvert and partying is not my style AT ALL – its maybe a twice a year thing). At this school there are two “Safety Forces”: the trained Police force (for the big stuff) and a student-led force called “Auxiliary Officers” (AO) to make sure the card-readers for the dorms are functioning (and of course to radio the police if there were any issues). I was an AO. Every pay-period (two weeks), each AO has to take an “overnight” from 0100-0700. During this shift is when this story takes place. Also - and this is important -  you can wait 7 minutes between card swipes. (it can get cold and windy at &lt;school&gt;, so this gives us time to warm up inside the dorms).\n\nI was assigned to check the doors for 4 of the 8 groups of dorms (at least 4 dorms per group, and at least 1 doors per dorm – 4 max), taking the most time in the group where the majority of Freshman live on-campus. As you can imagine, this is a pretty grim area that I didn't want to be in (almost all people that aren't freshman don't want to be there) – drunk, loud, disrespectful people stumbling around literally all night.\n\nThings were going fine, but I dreaded getting the freshman dorms. I knew I would be a long night because I was stuck there for a while. This is my typical routine: 1) check one card reader by making sure it opens when I swipe, let it close unaided, make sure it locks. 2) Make sure nobody is dead or having sex in the common area on the main floor. Wait ~5 mins in the common area 3) check the other doors  (if there if there are any) and wait ~5 mins 4) Move on to the next dorm and repeat.\n\nIn this particular dorm there were 2 doors. The moment I entered (after the first card swipe at around 0300) there was a noise, like someone was jumping on a trampoline but it wasnt regularly repeating. I look around the common rooms with nobody to be found. The sound didnt stop. “Okay, theres something wrong with the AC system, Ill write it down.” I said to myself. Wait for 5 mins, check the other door. Leave. THAT WAS THE PLAN.\n\nAs I was waiting (during the 5 mins) I realized the sound was getting louder. “oh great, this cant be good – wait is that the elevator?” It was, so I figured people were jumping in the elevator (just so you know, this isn’t a great thing to do in any elevator). I waited in front of the elevator so I could tel these fellow students “please dont jump in the elevator” I was not prepared for what I saw.\n\nIt looked like there were two kids crouching down in the elevator. They were looking down. “Excuse me...” I said. They looked up at me, startled, and then bolted out the door. Confused, I looked back into the elevator and I realized there was a third student in there. On the ground. Bleeding. Almost unconscious. Holy fuck. Those two kids just beat this kid to a pulp in the elevator. Reaction took over as I called over the radio “uh, station? Theres been an assault in &lt;dorm&gt; and police and medical are needed. I don't know what to do?” “stay there, Police have been notified.”\n\nBOOM back to reality. 1) Press the “hold” button on the elevator. 2) Help the student to a chair. 3) Keep him calm and monitor him – how? Im not trained in… like, anything. Wait ~5 mins for the police.\n\n16 Police officers in 8 cars showed up on site (it was a slow night) asking the kid questions, me questions. Medical showed up, sanitized the area, took the kid away on a stretcher.\n\nFast forward to the next day, and Im not on an overnight my boss (the Lt) comes in. “Eyebrows, my office”. Ive seen enough movies to know that particular phrase typically leads to a reaming and possible firing. Sure, ill follow you. “tell me about last night” he told me. He took a moment (I don't know if it was for analysis, tension, or what…) “We have cameras in the elevator, the lobby, the busses. We dont check them very often, but because you were a witness and called at the time of the crime, we were able to track where those students went and arrest them. They have been since expelled from this institution. This doesn’t happen too too often, so you deserve a thanks.” he pulled out some papers. “this is a Commendation for your work last night. I hope it helps in the future. I am also going to send out an email to everyone in the department about what happened. Well done.”\n\nTL;DR: Sounded like kids were jumping in the elevator. Turns out it was a 2v1 assault. Got a Commendation because they were both caught and expelled.\n\nOther details I learned after the fact: The two kids (A/B) that left followed this third kid (C) home. C was a part of a frat and told A/B (not in the frat) they were “getting too rowdy; go home” on several occasions. When things were dying down at the frat, C decided to go to his dorm via the school-sanctioned bus system (unaware that  A/B were following). A/B “piggybacked” on C. [piggybacking is letting people other than yourself) in on your personal card swipe. For students that aren't AOs, their card swipe only lets them in their dorm]. A/B did not live in that dorm. Still unaware he had talked to them earlier, C entered the elevator with A/B. In between floors 6 and 7 [I dont know how many total floors there were] A stopped the elevator. A/B proceeded to beat the christ out of C. someone else called the elevator and it went to a different floor. There was nobody there. The elevator then went to the lobby (its default location). The doors opened.\n\nNE: holy fuck thats long. I also realized I go back and forth between present and past tense a lot. I hope you can still make sense of my story.",

        "text": "This didn't happen to me but i watched it happen via the camera system we have that monitors the back gate of the community i work at. At the front gate we just see what is going on and not the audio, what was said was filled in when the guard came to the front gate to drop off paperwork.\n\nThe back gate closes at 7:30pm on the dot every day. It has an automatic motor attached to the residents side of the gate and at 7:30pm the timer goes off, gate arms go up, and the huge metal (and friggin heavy i might add) gate rolls out to close off the residents side. The exit side is a tad smaller and does not have a motor to assist in closing and must be closed manually.\n\nOn this day the automatic gate starts doing its thing and closing the entrance side gate. At roughly 7:35pm the guard is in the process of locking the pedestrian gate a resident comes to the gate and sees it is closing, backs up, and comes in through the exit side. The guard sees it and knows exactly who it was and planned on reporting it to management. He finishes locking the pedestrian gate and is about to go to the exit gate and close it when a resident who was walking their dog comes up all in a huff and begins to berate him for letting someone come in after hours and that he will be at the office in the morning to complain that he is \"just letting people in\" and \"ill have you fired for this!\"\n\nThe officer is the type who has been through a lot and having someone yell at him is equal to a fly buzzing around his head...annoying but nothing to stress out about. The ultimate no f*cks given attitude. \n\nHe is a good officer and smart. He stood where the cameras could see him and the resident to make sure it was all captured. The resident berates him for 20 minutes about doing his job correctly and bla bla bla. The guard just stood there and took it. When the resident finally felt he said enough he walked away and the officer finally was able to close the exit gate...20 minutes late. \n\nThe next day the officer was told that a resident has complained that he was letting people come in un-monitored after the normal gate closing time and they were reviewing the cameras. He did explain that he did have a resident come in the exit gate while he was locking the pedestrian gate the day before and that he also documented on his report that fact and also documented the ID of who the resident was.\n\nFast forward to 7:30pm that day and the officer is closing the gates now. He gets the pedestrian gate locked as the automatic gate is closing the entrance gate. Once hes done with the pedestrian gate he starts to pull the manual exit gate closed. He gets it about 3/4th the way closed when a car comes speeding up to the entrance side gate and begins to honk their horn. The guard stops closing the exit gate (its blocked the exit side totally by now) to see who is honking when the car backs up and pulls to the exit side and again honks his horn. The guard walks to the car and low and behold its the same guy who gave him hell for \"just letting people in\".\n\nThe resident demanded he be let in but the officer explained that the gate is closed at 7:30pm and he would need to use the front gate. The resident was not having it at all and was screaming at him to let him in using the excuse \"you haven't even locked it yet so just let me in\". The guard smiled and said you are correct, i haven't finished locking it yet and turned back to the gate and finished locking it with a smile. He then waved to the resident and finished locking up the gatehouse.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the front gate to drop off his paperwork the resident had come through the front gate and just glared at the officer who smiled and waved again and added \"have a nice day!\".\n\nSome people just have to be an ass.\n\n",

I'm relatively new to the world of private security; I qualified for my unarmed security license back in early December and started working for a company that does event and hotel security as well as guarding the property after hours. Due to the nature of the company I work for, I won't be posting too often but had this gem to share.\n\nA few months back, I was assigned to do security screening for a marathon. Specifically screening the volunteers coming in to work the marathon. The volunteer check-in point was located at a location currently closed for the season, so they had tents set up for the volunteers, and tables and gas-powered lights set up for the 4 security screeners who showed up at 2300 to start work, myself included. It was makeshift, so all bags had to be hand-checked.\n\nAfter three or so hours, I feel the urge to take a bio break. But where are the bathrooms? Oh, there are porta johns set up behind the volunteer tents.\n\nNo sinks.\n\nOh hell no.\n\nYou want me to use a porta john, somehow keeping my uniform pristine and my radio from touching anything, and then I'm expected to go back to work without washing my hands? Sure, let me touch your personal possessions... No. There is not enough hand sanitizer in the world for that.\n\nNow, one of the other guards with me is also female. The other two were guys. The guys didn't seem to care, but the other woman shared my sentiment (especially since we were supposed to go on our lunch in the near future) so we wander to the closed facility to see if we could find a bathroom.\n\nNope. Everything is locked tight, and we don't have access to the keys.\n\nShortly thereafter, a supervisor comes over with a motor unit to check on us and we explain our predicament. The next thing I know, the supervisor ordered the motor unit to take us to the nearest company facility to use the restrooms, which was thankfully just down and across the street. We wouldn't have been able to leave our post without authorization, and the supervisor stayed to assist the other two guards in case there was a rush.\n\nAs for the guys? They declined the same opportunity. I just hope they had hand sanitizer on them.\n\nEdit: typo",

        "text": "Partially venting here so forgive me if I get a little heated. I’m working at a concert venue providing security with a very large company, I’m originally supposed to work from 3:30 PM to 9 PM but I am asked to stay until 2 AM thinking “yeah I could use the overtime, what could possibly go wrong?” \n\nWELL they keep me at my post until 3:45 AM and I am exhausted but feeling happy that my paycheck will be a little fatter than usual. Cue to several weeks later when I see my paycheck and there’s no overtime. In fact some of my hours seem to be outright missing.\n\nHuh.\n\nCall the payroll department everyday for a week before they finally talk to me where they first tried to explain to me that due to a shift change I didn’t qualify for overtime (bs they had me at the same spot for 12 hours) and THEN they told me that some supervisor signed EVERYBODY out at 2 AM and that there was only one person on site (again bs because me and several others were still onsite until almost 4) so that’s where my missing hours went.  After a frustrated call they said they had to check with upper management but I’m pretty sure they were just telling to me fuck off.\n\nAnyone else experience this kind of trouble? I’m unbelievably pissed and already looking for work elsewhere, those hours aren’t going to break the bank but the principle of the thing is infuriating. How do you ask employees to work harder for you when you don’t pay them for their time? \n\nSorry for the long rant,  I figured some of you might relate or understand. Very disheartened but I’m sure the next job will be (hopefully) better.\n\nTL;DR: \nCompany asks me to stay 12 hours on a shift, supervisor signs everyone out early despite them staying longer and the payroll department refuses to provide overtime for said hour\n\nEdit: After a little research it looks like I do not qualify for OT since I worked past midnight and the clock resets in California at midnight, seems equivalent to picking up an 8 hr shift one day and a 4 hr shift the next. This does not change the fact that they shorted me about 2 hours and I will continue to pursue them on this matter. I'd like to thank you all in the comments for your help, it has given me an excellent basis to handle this matter calmly and intelligently and I appreciate it very much. I will try to post a followup when this is all over! \n\nEdit 2: I will be posting this on r/legaladvice to follow up on what you’ve all been saying. Hopefully I’ll get some good news and I’ll call the office one more time on Tuesday in an attempt to resolve this peacefully, otherwise it looks like department of labor time! I’ll be posting an update later next week, thanks for all the help!",
