If this annoys someone I apologize its not my intention. \n\n\nAs a huge fan of anything in space I decided to develop a game similar to stardew valley and star citizen. \n\nRight now in the game are 3 star systems. You can explore, trade, read books, conquer, buy ships, buy weapons, have ship garage, walk in your own ship, level ships independently, attack enemy space stations which gives Vampire Survivor vibes if you are into that or you can just do mining and relax in space and follow what NPCs are doing.\n\nNPCs right now can talk to each other like in Elder Scrolls games, collect money to upgrade their own ships, trade, patrol and attack each other which can lead to epic battle event(20+ vs 20+)\n\nPlayer can also collect rare items or sell items, place turrets, beacons and more.\n\nI am working alone on the project and it will be better and better. I believe some of you will find it to be fun.\n\nI am working on the game non stop with following features coming: walking and exploring planets and stations.\n\nIf you want to check videos and screenshots you can find it all on my twitter where I post devlogs: @UniprimeSoft\n\nGAME: https://goldspark.itch.io/universe-prime",

        "text": "So my understanding of the current proposed methods of creating a wormhole or \"warp drive\" is that it requires negative energy densities, and thus exotic matter. Would it not be possible to cheat this a bit by manipulating vacuum energy? As in inhibiting the formation of these particles using something like the Casimir Effect, thus lowering the energy density in a region of spacetime below it's natural state and changing the topology of spacetime. Using specially designed geometries but on a much larger scale than the microscopic experiments we have done up to this point. No exotic matter required, provided these theories are correct, that we are not misinterpreting the mathematics or observations of the Casimir Effect\n\nThe other question is about navigating. Let's say it is in fact possible to create a wormhole, using the method above or any other. How the hell would you be able to control your exit point? It isn't like your ship is continuing on it's current vector, you're punching a hole in spacetime to somewhere else, but where exactly would that be? And if you want to travel say 100ly, you'd have no idea what is currently there because observation we made are based on information that is 100 years old. Could be you pop out into a rock or a rogue planet and get pulverized",
