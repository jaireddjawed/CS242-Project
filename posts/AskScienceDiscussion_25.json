Anyway let's say the inclined plane is at 45 degrees and completely frictionless. It seems like there would be a torque because the center of mass isn't directly over the point of contact with the plane. However the ball rolling doesn't seem to provide any benefit to sliding because it's frictionless. Also if the ball was rolling the opposite direction it should be to roll down the plane it seems as if it shouldn't matter again because of the lack of friction. I feel as if the ball would roll but that would be entirely incidental to it moving down the plane. What's the answer and how would I get it from a formula? Thanks in advance.",

After a bit of reading, it appears that symptoms of PTSD are common behavioral traits among trained dogs who've participated in disaster relief or military operations.  And other animals in the wild have even been documented to commit suicide.\n\nFrom a conservation perspective, is this something we can/should do something about?  I've read about baby rhinos &amp; elephants in wildlife preserves who've been traumatized by the experience of having their parents killed by poachers.  I haven't yet researched thoroughly enough to discover if there is any sort of rehabilitation regime that specifically address mental health in the mold of evidence based medicine we expect of people.  Or does something like that even exist?\n\nIn a completely different tract, if we acknowledge that animals can suffer mental disorders, there is the tantalizing possibility of using animal models to study and better understand the causes/treatments of human mental illness.  But that opens an enormous can of worms on ethical grounds.  What to do?\n\nThoughts?  insights?",

What I didn't get is how do we after at least 10 years of living all of a sudden make it brains switch so fast? Or is this theory wrong? \n\nCould you please help me?\nThanks",

One end of the rope is tied to a extremely heavily anvil sitting a top a skyscraper and the other end tied to a resting spacecraft 100 million miles away (its near the sun). The rope is taut and it can’t significantly stretch. If you drop that anvil off the skyscraper, will the pull on the spaceship happen instantly, at the speed of light (about 8 minutes later) or something else? If it happens instantaneously (my assumption) would that be a case of information propagating faster than light? It’s can’t be, but why isn’t it? If the rope was taut, couldn’t you pull on it in a Morse code pattern and pass actual information?",

If I start eating again I feel less drowsy, till I stop eating.  This normally lifts after a few minutes (or worst case 30) to some degree. When I am out this mostly lifts, but the minute I get home I get a drop (duration I was out matches the severity of the drop). The drowsiness seems to roll up from my chest and feels like it is coming out my eyes. Everything else on my body feels energetic, this can't be fatigue.  I've been tested by every medical specialty under the sun--all negative results.  I am not mentally anxious (I have been before this though for years) but physically I have symptoms of anxiety (palps, hyperventilation, cold chills, hot flashes, hyper-aroused, exaggerated startle response).  I am on Lexapro and Inderal (just recently) for these, but the waves of drowsiness don't seem to fit the model and are actually the most debilitating part of this. \n\nMy working theory is this drowsiness is some kind of huge serotonin release instantly and happens throughout the day in waves as well.  Maybe my hyper-arousal state is causing a neurotransmitter imbalance that makes my system out of whack.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "Traditional TTL auto exposure systems can be right or wrong depending on the situation. Some situations will work perfectly while many will cause errors in the exposure. Two examples that cause errors include a candlelight scene and a person in a black shirt taking a self-portrait against a bright white background.\n\nWhen taking photos, most users utilize TTL metering. The default TTL mode does an average of the whole frame. It takes individual readings points throughout the frame and does an average. In statistics, this would be considered an average of the population. As auto exposure systems expose for middle grey, this is similar to assuming a normal distribution.\n\nMy solution applies the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). It works by taking readings of different points in a region with similar colors and reflectance levels. These are the samples and not the population. The idea of regions with similar values is to make it easier to obtain a \"normal distribution\" for the regions. An average will be done with the samples.\n\nOne concern is that if the median (middle grey) is greater or less than the average brightness of the scene, it will cause exposure errors. This is because of exposure for the mean. Would my system solve this problem? If not, what changes should be made to my idea?\n\nWhat advice do you have? Thanks in advance.",

Stating “all that is possible, happens” does not resolve what is possible. The concept of multiverses is not well defined until the space of possible universes has been fully characterized; it is quite unclear how to do this uniquely. The issue of what is to be regarded as an ensemble of ‘all possible’ universes can be manipulated to produce any result you want, by redefining what is meant by this phrase — standard physics and logic have no necessary sway over them: what I envisage as ‘possible’ in such an ensemble may be denied by you. What super-ordinate principles are in operation to control the possibilities in the multiverse, and why? A key point here is that our understandings of the possibilities are always of necessity arrived at by extrapolation from what we know, and my imagination may be more fertile than yours, and neither need correspond to what really exists out there — if indeed there is anything there at all. Do we include only\n\n• Weak variation: e.g. only the values of the constants of physics are allowed to vary? This is an interesting exercise but is certainly not an implementation of the idea ‘all that can happen, happens’. It is an extremely constrained set of variations.\n\n• Moderate variation: different symmetry groups, or numbers of dimensions, etc. We might for example consider the possibility landscapes of string theory as realistic indications of what may rule multiverses. But that is very far indeed from ‘all that is possible’, for that should certainly include spacetimes not ruled by string theory.\n\n• Strong variation: different numbers and kinds of forces, universes without quantum theory or in which relativity is untrue (e.g. there is an aether), some in which string theory is a good theory for quantum gravity and others where it is not, some with quite different bases for the laws of physics (e.g. no variational principles).\n\n• Extreme variation: universes where physics is not well described by mathematics; with different logic; universes ruled by local deities; allowing magic as in the Harry Potter series of books; with no laws of physics at all? Without even mathematics or logic? Which is claimed to be the properties of the multiverse, and why? We can express our dilemma here through the paradoxical question: Are the laws of logic necessary in all possible universes?\n\nSo he is proposing a multiverse classification which includes illogical universes. But as all scientists I've talked with say, that's impossible.\n\nI've contacted Ellis to ask him some questions about it (his answers are below each question):\n\n1. Does your classification includes universes where things that do not/cannot exist like problems without a logic solution (like Russell's set solution) would actually exist? Would it include inconsistent universes too?\n\nI had not thought of that as useful. But maybe it suseful\n\n2. Every physicist I've talked with denies the possibility of an inconsistent set of laws of physics. Let alone an illogical universe. Even Clément Vidal says in his article  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.1407.pdf) \"We need to have a logic which describes M (the set of possible universes)\". So how can it be compatible with the \"extreme variation\" types of universes?\n\nWell we have to have some basis for describing the universe if we are to say anything about it. Without some form of logic you can't describe it.\n\n3. Do these variations and universes you describe have a physical/scientific background? I mean, is there any scientific/physical theory (not mere philosophy) that proposes such variations and universes? Or even if it is just philosophy, do you know if there is a scientific theory that supports this?\n\nTo some degree String Theory provides a basis for universes with alternative physics.\n\nI replied to his answers:\n\n\"I had not thought of that as useful. But maybe it suseful\"\n\nCan you extend that a bit, please? What do you mean as \"useful\"? Are you saying that in your multiverse classification you didn't thought of this specific case (universes where things that do not/cannot exist like problems without a logic solution (like Russell's set solution) would actually exist, or inconsistent universes...) but that they could exist under in your theory?\n\n\"Well we have to have some basis for describing the universe if we are to say anything about it. Without some form of logic you can't describe it.\"\n\nBut then an illogical universe is impossible? But in your multiverse classification you say that there could be universes like that.\n\n\"To some degree String Theory provides a basis for universes with alternative physics. \"\n\nYes, but as you said in your multiverse classification, string theory universes would belong to moderate variation universes. I'm asking for the universes included in the highest level (extreme variation). Is there any physical/scientific theory that could create these types of universes?\n\nHe said he had no time and we finished the conversation.\n\nCan you help me with this?",

The concern I have with using a Color Filter Array (CFA) is that it can cause problems when a function like this is used and raise exposure time or aperture requirements.\n\nI was reading research papers on the Transverse Field Detector. A paper from December, 2018 titled \"The Transverse Field Detector (TFD): A Novel Color-Sensitive CMOS Device\" said that superficial junctions are used. I know Foveon collects all 3 colors on top, red and green in the middle, and red only at the bottom. While no CFA is used, the corrupting effects of photon noise are more major versus a CFA like Bayer. Foveon has higher color resolution and fidelity than Bayer.\n\nThe papers, \"Combining transverse field detectors and color filter\narrays to improve multispectral imaging systems\" and \"Multispectral Filter Arrays: Recent Advances and Practical Implementation\" proposed using a CFA with TFD. The first paper measured the color crosstalk and accuracy. System 7 had no CFA; it had low color fidelity and higher crosstalk between the channels. While some overlapping is good, too much causes serious problems.\n\nWhat are some ways to implement the TFD without a CFA and have reasonable crosstalk levels? What are some ways to reduce corrupting effects of crosstalk, photon noise, and electrical noise? Are there noise canceling solutions that can be applied before or during the A/D conversion? This is to lower color noise in the recorded image and improve the resolving power of legitimate details.\n\nWho or what should I turn to for discussion? What are your thoughts?

        "text": "The other day I was having lunch with an old acquaintance, and the conversation shifted to science. In particular, we were discussing the lack of scientists in politics, and how it is detrimental to scientific policy on climate change. Along the way, he made the statement that he \"doesn't really know any scientists.\" \n\nI was a bit taken aback, as earlier in the conversation I had told him that I was a microbiologist (usually the most layman descriptor I use for my occupation). After explaining to him that **I** am a scientist, and that he has other friends that I know of who have become scientists as well, a lightbulb went off in his head, and I think he was a little embarrassed by it (he is generally a relatively intelligent and educated person; certainly someone I would imagine could have become a scientist himself if he had so desired). \n\nBut this got me thinking. I feel like part of the reason why the general public stigmatizes science can be attributed to the fact that people don't think they can relate to scientists; that they don't really know any, and they think we all work in underground labs run by some hush hush government organization, or by some evil pharmaceutical company like the Umbrella Corporation. \n\nSo from now on, the very first term I will use to describe myself is \"scientist.\" I will tell it to anybody who asks what I do for a living, and I will write it on every single from here on out that asks for my occupation. We need make the general public more comfortable with scientists, and that begins with us being approachable and relatable as normal human beings who could be your friend or neighbor.  \n\nSo please, fellow scientists of Reddit, nobody knows what a Molecular Microbiologist, or a Cancer Epigeneticist, or a Geophysical Fluid Dynamicist is. Save the semantics for your colleagues, or as an extension to your most general descriptor, \"Scientist.\"",
