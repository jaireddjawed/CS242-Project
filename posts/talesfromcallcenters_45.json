        "text": "I've always been a reddit lurker and a non poster, but I have to vent on this. I work for one of the major backbone owners of the internet in the u.s.. My department is a repair center for business customers who will pay a small amount extra to be able to abuse techs over not getting updates fast enough, wanting more personal service, etc.  However like most call centers, it is woefully understaffed. I'm assuming that unlike most call centers, we have few departments to refer to for other tasks.  I.e. I'm not a ticket/call monkey.  I'm educated, certified, and trained in networking, I test circuits, diagnose issues, fix them if possible AND deal with calls, direct customer facing, etc. So also a ticket/call monkey on top of needing actual technical skills. \n\n\nWe have a very large grocery store chain customer who had zero state side support of their own. Oh, they have a huge call center, but it's a contacted company from India. This by itself doesn't bother me, but it seems like they are more \"slave driver\" than us.  I.e., I swear they don't let them eat lunch if they don't get an escalation since they beg for them incessantly.  I got a complaint for not escalating a higher level outage. Our company never does that as it's already a priority at that point, but some just say that for appeasement. My bosses asked what happened, but never gave feedback either way. \n\n\nWell tonight, I received 3 calls from this customer in 10 minutes, all asking for updates on the same circuit. The first two,  I was calm, told them what was going on and that technical issues were preventing us testing for now, but I'd email them as soon as I could test. Both times \"any eta? Escalation?\" Immediately after being told \"the carrier says they repaired, I agree with you it's still down, but I can't get any meaningful info until testing is back, can't say exactly when it will be back.\" So the third time this happened in 10 minutes for the same ticket, I was a bit perturbed.  I didn't blow up or anything, but I said \"how does it logically follow that there would be an eta after the information I just gave you? \" keep in mind, this was a site that's closed for several hours yet. Guy asks for last name, department, etc. So I said \"oh, you guys are going to make another formal complaint about me over demanding things that don't make sense? \" yeah, stupid of me, but this was the third call in ten minutes when the information given was accurate and all I had at the time. He calls his supervisor on who tries to chide me \"we're you're customer, you can't talk to us like that\" so I say \"I've given you the latest update for the third time in ten minutes,  you don't need to call every 3 minutes on the same case.\"\n\nI'm sure I'll get a talking to, I just hope I don't get fired, this job isn't hard, we'd just have a low number of really green,  amotivated, techs and a couple shit customers who think we're 1000 in number when it's only about 5 people per shift.\n\n\nUpdate: the customer has called about once per hour since and hilariously keeps getting me and hanging up after my greeting. There's only one other guy here tonight but he isn't getting their calls due to the call algorithm vs our break rotation. They got their update as soon as I could give it. ",

What's your concern?\n\nC: My bill went up $5. Why did it do that?\n\n(most viewing packages got a $5 a month rate increase in the middle of January, so I field a fair number of calls with this question every week, and I say as much to the customer)\n\nC: Why did you do that?\n\nMe: Well, sir, unfortunately, what we have to pay for the programming you enjoy went up this past year, so we have to increase what we charge our customers, though our costs went up much more than the $5 your bill went up.\n\nC: Well, I think that's bullshit. You just lost a customer. *click*\n\nHe's a ten year customer, so a rate increase isn't new to him. Had he given me the chance, I would have helped him lower his bill. I pulled up his account later on in the day, and he had called back (thanks for killing my repeat rate) and the agent he spoke with offered him a $5 credit for six months, which he accepted.\n\n*sigh*",

It is usually only 4 digits, it can be 6, and for some a whopping 8 with a dash somewhere between the numbers.  Now some I have to look them up with their phone number if they don't know their ID, no big deal really.  But this lady was mad that she had to call to have us fill out a shipping label for her and she made sure to let me know that right off that bat.  I'll refer to her as EL for Entitled Lady. \n\nHere's what followed when I asked for her location ID  \nEL: \" I can't be bothered with remembering that. I've worked here too long and do such and such at my job all day to have to remember that!\"   \nMe: \"Ok, what's the phone number there?\"  \nEL: *rattles off phone number*  \nMe: \"Ok, thank you.  And that makes your ID _______\"  \nEL: \"I'm NOT going to remember that, I do such and such at my job all day long to be bothered to remember that.\"   \n\nThe rest of the call actually went well, she just decided she was too important to know their 4 digit code for her location.  I'm sure she's just a peach to actually work with directly.  My roommate said I should have told her the importance of writing down her ID suggesting she keep it by the computer or phone she uses the most.  If I can get away with saying it without sounding condescending, I may very well try it if I get her call again. ",

All of the shifts are moving to 30 minute lunches this year. The calls come through back to back all day everyday. Customers and management are rude. Some of my metrics are based on circumstances that I can't control. And I'm stuck in my chair all day long. My supervisor can go to the bathroom whenever she wants and for however long she wants without having tell anyone. If I want to log out for 2 minutes to finish closing an account I'll get in serious trouble. \n\nIn short my job is hell. I knew that call center job is less than ideal but I didn't realize that it can be this shitty. I wouldn't wish this type of work on my worst enemy. \n\nThe funny thing is that my job has amazing benefits. Great insurance, tuition reimbursement and pretty nice amount of paid time off. My company is a great company to be a part of; but my position is terrible. If I knew that I could move to an offline role I would stay around. Unfortunately a very very tiny percentage of people ever do that so I'm trying to leave as soon as possible!",

I should be able to use my CC.\n\nMe: OK sir, like i said before If you make a payment you are able to continue using the card.\n\nCust: This is bad customer service what kind of bank doesn't let their customer use their CC. [Other bank name] doesnt do this.\n\nMe: Sir you are 10 days past due, I can assure you that no bank will let you use continue using the card if YOU ARE 10 days past due.\n\nso the customer begins a rant about when he came to the United states he choose to bank w/ my employer due to the name and that he had never had this issue until now and he hopes that someone is listening in on the call so they can report my bad customer service.\n\nnow at this point I am tired of him blaming ME for his problems that he had cause and I let him know that If he had made his payment on time his wife would not have an issue and I also told him that I cannot assist him due to non payment but he continues to complain.\n\nCust: When I am done paying this CC I will shut it down\n\nMe: Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nCust: No. I am. Shutting this card tomorrow.\n\nMe: You have a wonderful day.\n*end of call*\n\n*TL;DR\nSo this guy is blaming me for being 10 days past due, makes it a big point that his wife doesn't have a room to sleep in a different state. he is going to cancel the CC because he insists that he goes past due before but can use the CC.\n\nI will leave you guys with this song by Metallica\n[Ain't My Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNXmKiEqVx4)\n",

The payment goes through. No signatures to forge and no giving your personal info to the store just to get a signature.\n\nThe number of people who called in today to complain about this is staggering. Even after explaining that it was for their protection, they still want to threaten with \"shopping other places\".\n\nBye Felicia.",

Now, is it the iPhone 6 128GB in Gold you would like, or the iPhone 6 Plus, and if so, what storage capacity do you require? \n\n&gt; AL: THE BIG ONE SO I CAN KEEP ALL MY PHOTOS AND VIDEOS.  I have been with your company for 5 years and I have NEVER spoken to someone so ANNOYING.\n\n&gt; Me: Please don't speak to me like that, I am trying to help you. So you want the iPhone 6 128GB [she hasn't told me this directly, but I'm beyond caring] in gold. Would you like to remain on the same plan you are on now?\n\n&gt; AL: Of course I do, why would I want to change it?!\n\n&gt; Me: Okay... so, if you want to remain on your current plan, the upfront cost for the phone will be [XXX.XX], and we charge £6.98 for delivery.\n\n&gt; AL: I DON'T WANT TO PAY ANYTHING NOW AND I WILL NOT PAY FOR DELIVERY. Send it to the store and I will pick it up.\n\n&gt; Me: I'm sorry, we do not dispatch phones to our stores, and I cannot process the order without both the upfront cost, and the delivery charge.\n\n&gt; AL: I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER, I DON'T WANT TO PAY.\n\nI asked her to please hold, and sat there for a moment. Called to my manager, I explained, and he told me she \"could get fucked\" and walked off. He wasn't the most helpful guy. So I pick the phone back up.\n\n&gt; Me: I have spoken to my manager, and he states that there is no movement on the upfront cost, as this is the latest iPhone device [it was relatively new at this point].\n\n&gt; AL: YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO HELP ME. What's your name? I want to speak to your manager NOW! Where do they find you people, you know nothing about customer service. I want to cancel, I don't want to talk to you any more, put me on to someone else.\n\n&gt; Me, done at this point: Okay then, that's no problem at all. Just need to inform you that there is a 30 day notice period to cancel. I will transfer you to...\n\n&gt; AL: JUST CANCEL MY ACCOUNT YOU STUPID BITCH.\n\nI'd had enough at this point. We only had to give one warning, and while I hadn't threatened to terminate the call previously, I had asked her not to speak to me in that manner and I was tired of it.\n\n&gt; Me: I'm sorry, but I'm disconnecting this call and noting your abusive behaviour on your account to forewarn other agents. Goodbye. \n\nI heard her shriek something as I hung up. Don't know what it was. Don't care.\n\nBonus points: She called back in, and got one of my team members. She wanted to complain about me. The team member who took the call was writing on his whiteboard what she was saying about me (claiming I swore at her, that I called her a racist name... I can't see what colour you are over the phone, what?) and killing himself laughing. My manager took the call from my team mate, told the lady he would play back the call. Apparently she didn't want anything done about it after he said that, and was transferred to the Retentions department to either upgrade or cancel there.  \n\nNow I've typed it out, it doesn't seem that bad. But it really shook me. ",

Whiny lady calls in needing a password reset which is no big deal I do these all the time but I see she's not registered for online although her husband is registered for online. So it looks like she's been logging into her husbands account to pay the bills this whole time, this situation happens a lot. She has 2 options, either I can register her online and she'd be able to access the same information as her husbands account OR I speak directly to the husband to verify its him and reset his password. She does not like this. \n\nWL: This is very annoying, IM the one who made my husbands account, just give me my password!\n\nMe: As I explained Mrs. W it is not, so I can help u make an account under your name or if your husbands around I can reset the password for him.\n\nWL: But I don't wanna! My husband is asleep and this is my account! I don't see what's so hard for you to understand that I am the only one who accesses this account online, just give me the password!\n\nI explain her 2 options 4 more times and she says whyyyyyy every time but finally she gives in.\n\nMe: Ok great I just registered you online and you should be receiving that password in an email in a few seconds and will have access to the same exact information as you did on your husbands account.\n\nWL: (In a very annoyed tone) Whatever but my agent better call me immediately because there shouldn't have been any reason I couldn't get into MY account today. She emphasized and raised her voice on 'my'.\n\nMe: Definitely, I will explain exactly what happened to your agent and have him call you  as soon as possible to discuss it further. Is there anything else I can assist with today?\n\nWL: No, this is still ridiculous that I couldn't login to MY account.\n\nMe: Ok well I apologize again but have a great night and thanks for calling *company name*.\n\nThis call took 25 minutes! Password resets or registering them online usually take me 3 minutes or less, but noo every once in awhile I'll get a customer thinking they know everything and I'm wrong and they think they can complain about my procedures to their agent. I left a lengthy message for her agent about how upset she was at me for just doing the correct procedures as we have for the past 10 years or so.",

        "text": "This is rather unusual, I know. Let me first tell you a bit about my job, some of you might be familiarized with this anyway. \n\nI'm a Spanish-English interpreter. I work from home. I have a laptop and a good headset for me to get your calls and try my best to help you. \n\nI should I mention I worked at a regular Customer Service Call Center before, so I have experience on your side of the coin. \n\nEverybody is so friendly. Clients (You reps) and your customers are very respectful towards us, me anyway, but sometimes there are things you may do, which are actually quite understandable, but that make both of out jobs much harder. \n\n- First thing is Names, addresses, product/plans names, etc. Most people who don't speak English won't pronounce English very effectively even if they're reading it. Kinda like pulling an African map and asking you for city names. We interpreters some times have to guess what all the mumbling was, and it doesn't always work. \n\nIf you guys ask for the spelling that's actually really nice and thoughtful, but people don't always know or have access to a piece of mail or anything. \n\n- Patience. I know, we all want to get rid of a call and keep our metrics in line but we as interpreters have to pretty much write it all down (The important bits, at least) and taking 2 - 8 seconds after the Spanish speaking person stopped talking to finish the note isn't even that much. A lot of reps ask IMMEDIATLY for the translation, yeah, not that easy. \n\n- Family. This is a bit stereotypical but most Latino families rely heavily on the father figure. Some wives are shy and they just can't or won't tell you specific information or make decisions even if they know the answer. Most of the times they have the husband listening and talking back and forth between them before giving an answer. \n\nAs an interpreter it is VERY difficult to hear two people trying to come out with an answer while reps ask two or three more questions to add to the confusion. \n\n- Lastly. Pauses... I can not tell you how many times I've had to skip part of your questions because you end the sentence with a completely different question I just know is going to trigger your customer. You want a policy number to find the claim information  and also know what happened? Yeah, let's get the answer to the first question, you look it up WHILE your customer tells me what happened. \n\nThis I can understand. If it was just you and the customer then you hear the policy number first and listen to the story while you're looking for the info. I, however, have to wait for them to finish the whole thing before I can tell you the number. See what I mean? \n\nAnyway. These are just some things I can give you a comment on right now, I know we interpreters can be unreliable or we may forget some things but that's just the result between two people who are trying to have a fluid conversation but can't, because there's another one in the middle with lots of pauses and limitations. \n\nHave you had a bad experience with an interpreter? Let me know what happened and maybe we can help each other =) ",

I have a maximum of 60 seconds of unavailable time in between calls. And I usually have another call pop in 15 to 120 seconds after that. I just wish that I could get up and go to the bathroom whenever I want to, or go refill my water bottle as soon as it's empty. Unfortunately I don't have that luxury. But I must be online and ready all day long.\n\nWhat make my lack of downtime so difficult is seeing random people go throughout their day with freedom. I see supervisors and other offline people standing around joking all day long. My old supervisor would go grab food from the cafeteria and take smoke breaks whenever he wanted to. On the flipside I get in trouble if I go unavailable for a minute or so if I want to finish closing out a customer account before another call comes in.\n\nI'm currently in the process of looking for another job. I'm not leaving because of the customers. I'm leaving because of the rigidity of the schedule. I must have be happy and ready to help a customer at all times throughout the day. That is just so tiring to me. Some days I feel like a slave because I'm tied to my headset all day. ",

        "text": "I work in a 3rd party call/contact center, preparing insurance quotes for networking technology.  I hit my 9-year anniversary back in November.  I spent the first year in outbound sales, then 3 1/2 years that was 50% inbound calls and 50% inbound email.  Since then it's been 100% inbound email.  Phone calls are only needed occasionally to confirm details.  For the longest time, I actually enjoyed my job.  Now?  Not so much.\n\nI'm the kind of person that is detail oriented.  I like to dig down and find out *why* something isn't working properly.  One of my greatest joys at work was finding a solution after others had given up.  I loved the hard cases, because it was a chance to learn something new.  I also wrote all of it down, and have a good index system.  If another coworker ran into a problem similar to what I had researched, I could usually answer it for them.  Eventually, I had people from 4 time zones and 2 continents IM'ing me to ask for advice on a near-daily basis.\n\nOf course, in a company that holds metrics above everything else, that will cause problems.\n\nIt took them just over 6 years, but they finally broke me.  Multiple write-ups, etc.  They finally got me to care about metrics more than answers.  To finish things quickly, with \"acceptable\" answers, instead of spending a couple of days digging out the exact answer needed for that specific situation.  I even got to the point of getting a small thrill when I could tell a difficult customer \"no, that's not in my job description\" instead of figuring out how to fix their situation.  I've stopped going above and beyond.  I managed to fit in with the rest.\n\nThat changed 2 months ago.\n\nStarting in December, we were informed that our client is finally valuing customer service.  Now, going above and beyond is a good thing.  Cases per day is not as important.  Instead, the number of satisfaction surveys you can get is more important.  Anything with a 9 or 10 will get recognition.  We have a board set up that tracks those surveys, and your name gets a star if you get one.  If you get 5 stars, you get a $25 bonus in your paycheck.  The board (and count) resets with each fiscal quarter.\n\nThere are people who have gotten 10+ stars in a single month.  7 years ago, I would have been one of them.  Now?  I just went through 2 whole months without a single star.  Coworkers around me are getting recognition for going above and beyond, but I'm not.  My \"above and beyond\" has been burned out of me.\n\nI'm rather bitter about this, as you might imagine.",

There was the volume, of course - but she also had me on speakerphone, with an echo and additional noises.

I can see the data is used consistently ever day, but we don't know how the data is being used on our side.\n\nCX: Let me check his phone... ... His phone says 32 GB since 2014.

I go over the bill, explain its because of long distance calls. She knows, her neighbor has an out of state # as his cellphone number and that's what's being called. However because it's only calling with in building because the line she is talking about is set up as the door answering for this tenant. she doesn't think the long distance rate should apply. \n\n\nI started explaining how if the area code is out of state it is a long distance charge. Ok she got that but she think WE should monthly credit this because it's the tenants fault for using an out of state cell phone as his call answer line. Not happening \n\n\nCheck the notes she calls in every 3 months complaining about the bill, looking for credits or trying to some home make her basic $18 no additional services line to not have to pay these long distance changes\n\n\nSo ok back to the bill. She understand the rates on the line and if that tenant continues to  use that line the bill on this line this is what's going to happen\n\nCustomer is concerned she going to get a late payment fee because of not getting her bill. I tell her the bill is not due until 2/8, offered to hVe someone walk her through setting up an online account. Explained she can get her recent bills there incase it happens again, the bill got lost, damaged etc. it IS mail... And told her she can make online payments too. I told her check or cc. I also offered pay over the phone, which does have a fee. And I could check for payment centers she wouldn't need the bill just the account # that she had\n\nC: I shouldn't have to pay a late fee. I got my bill late\n\n\nMe: your bill is due on 2/8 the bill might there soon\n\nC: I don't think it's fair, I didn't get my bill and this bill is too high I want the late fee taken off\n\n\nMe: I can see you're stressing about potentially getting a late fee. we have things like paying online or over the \nPhone to prevent that that I can get you help with right now to avoid that. Plus payment locations\n\nC: I don't want to play online, or over the phone or go to a payment center. I want it credited to my bill and I wanted you to note my account that I called because I hadn't received my bill and need a credit for a late payment\n\nMe : certainly ms co-cop I am noting your account now that you did not revceive your bill, I ambsending out a Dup copy.  Also that I provided you with the amount and date due and that you are worried about the late paypment so i provided you with multiple options on how to pay the bill before the due date\n\nThank you for calling\n\n\n\nI like to think I got her a 60% of getting denied the late fee\n\n\n\nBut really isn't the bigger issue here the co-co owner with the out of state cell phone making a $35/mth be $70-$79 because of the out of state number. The door answering is paid by the coop...make a rule that all the door answering lines need to have a local number",

And that would be that.\nOne day a man called and said his wife and kids were at Disneyland on vacation. She was trying to use the card and it got declined. He asked what could cause that. I explained our security feature and asked for his info to get in the account.  It turns out we had just closed his account that same day. He had just paid it off so his wife could use it on vacation. He asks if he can reopen it and I let him know I'm unable to. Then he asked if he could just apply for another card.  I told him we can't do it over the phone. Only online or in a bank. I also said he'd probably be denied since we recently closed his account.  (I wasn't supposed to tell him that but I didn't want him to hurt his credit farther) \nNeedless to say, he was pretty furious with me. Screaming about his wife and kids being stuck there with no money. Telling me I ruined their vacation. I felt so bad for the guy I just took it. I couldn't do anything for him.

        "text": "Sorry if this is formatted incorrectly, I mostly lurk Reddit and found this subreddit. I've enjoyed the stories I've read so far and decided I would post two of my weirdest calls. These both happened a few years ago when I was new and was just a lowly \"Tier 1\" agent. If you like them I have more stories, both good and bad!\n\nI work for a hotel chain, and for both of these calls I was just taking reservations/answering generic questions. Some back story for me, I spent some time in college with a Bioinformatics major and didn't like it. After toying around with the idea of switching to a music major(My real passion) I ended up dropping out and attending Culinary school while I was working in food service. This was my first call center job, and I loved it so far. Since I had just started I opted to not go back to Culinary school for that semester while I got acclimated to this new job, as I was tired of the culinary world. This first story is the time a psychic called me.\n\nI got a woman on the phone who needed to book two reservations. She was very polite, it turns out her son was playing football at a big game and I managed to find her a cheap hotel about 5 miles away from the stadium. She was driving to the hotel and was ecstatic that I could get her so close, and she wanted another hotel for the drive back to her hometown after the game. We started talking about her kids while I was doing all the \"paperwork\" portions of the reservation.\n\nWe talked about her son and how awesome it was he was playing in the big tournament(I honestly don't remember what it was for, I'm not a sports guy- but I do know it was a pretty important college level tournament) and then she said, \"You know, you really should go back to college, but for a music degree this time.\"\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks, I was still technically in training so getting a \"test call\" from my trainer, or someone else while she listened, would be completely plausible. I asked her to repeat that, in case she just happened to be talking to someone else in the room and she said again, \"You should go back to college for a music degree. It would really make you happier.\" I had absolutely no idea what to say, this wasn't covered in my training manual!\n\n\"I don't know what you mean, I'm sorry?\" I said, it totally came out like a question. I was baffled.\n\"I'm a psychic, don't worry.\" She responded, and then she went on to describe me by my height and hair. At this point I stood up to look for someone, because there was absolutely no way that this wasn't my trainer playing an elaborate prank on me, and that's when she said the freakiest thing yet, \"You can sit down... I'm not in the call center with you!\" We both laughed and talked more about her being psychic. She told me to add her on Facebook, which I told her I was pretty sure we weren't allowed to do, and we talked more about her life as a psychic as the call was wrapping up. I had already written down her name and the city she was from to look her up when I got home(We aren't technically allowed to use Facebook or our phones at work, I'm sure writing down her name wasn't something I should do either but I felt like I could at least get a pass on that.) and it turns out she is a real person, with real kids, and her son was actually playing in the big football game. I don't normally believe in psychics, but she was scary accurate and I still get chills thinking about it sometimes.\n\n-----------\n\nSince the first story is kinda short and this one isn't long at all(Just something I thought was funny) I figured I would put them together. This is after I had been working for a few more months, still just a Tier 1 agent but with a lot more experience. A guy called and was talking with me about his trip to Paris. I studied French in high school and have always wanted to visit Paris. My teacher did a good job of teaching us not just the language, but about the regions in France and a lot about Paris as a city. We have a couple of hotels in Paris and he wanted to know which would be best for his needs, which is a pretty standard thing to ask.\n\nNow, we have a few hotels in the more tourist-y parts of the city and another one near La Defense which is basically a business district. The one near La Defense met his criteria and was way less expensive(Almost half the price) than the others, so when I told him about the area he was a little turned off. I told him I knew a bit about Paris even though I had never been myself, and explained how it has an open-air museum and that its proximity to the Metro(Subway) would mean they could very easily get wherever they wanted to be. He was sold almost instantly.\n\nI made his reservation and we talked about Paris for a few more minutes, I ended up being on the call with him for about 45 minutes. I always love helping out people and will gladly talk to you about your trip for as long as you need to if you're polite. I don't just go the extra mile for people like this guy, I will travel to the moon for you. He ended up giving me the name of a travel agency company his friend was the CEO of and he was a major shareholder in, they were looking to open an office in Hawaii. He said if I wanted a job in Hawaii all I had to do was email the company and he would get me an interview. I thanked him for everything, and said I'd consider it and we parted ways.\n\nI ended up looking him and the company up(All true, by the way. The company existed and was opening an office in Hawaii) but ultimately didn't end up doing anything about it. Part of me regrets not looking into it a little more, but I'm pretty happy with where I am now. He was probably one of the most appreciative people I've talked to in my entire time in the call center.",

I have two more days of training and then I start the phones. I feel like I know absolutely nothing about the product. I'm so afraid I won't know what a customer is asking, or I'll give them the wrong information, or they'll be rude to me. Can anyone please give me any advice on dealing with rude customers? Also, is it normal to feel like you know nothing before getting on the phone? Does it get better? Are people really mean?

I assure her that a technician isn't necessary since this is usually fixed in 5 minutes by changing the input on the TV, and dive in before she can argue.\n\nMe: Are there any lights on the front of the receiver?\n\nLB: Yeah.\n\nMe: Great. Can you see the back of the TV?\n\nLB: I guess...\n\nMe: Perfect, can you tell me if there's a thick cable with a rectangular end plugged into the back of it?\n\n*I've given up calling cables by their \"complicated,\" proper names like coaxial and HDMI.*\n\nLB: How am I supposed to know that? I'm just a customer. Can't you tell what cable it is?\n\nMe: No, because the installers don't leave notes on what cables they used. And...look on the back of the TV?\n\nLB: I shouldn't have to look back there, your shit don't work! Why are you even asking this?\n\nMe: Because if I know what cable is connecting the receiver to the TV, I can narrow down what inputs we need to try.\n\nLB: [Continues arguing in poor grammar and occasionally incomprehensible words]\n\nMe: Ma'am, anybody who got past the level in kindergarten where you put square pegs in square holes would be able to answer this question. Now, is it a rectangular cable end?\n\nWhat followed was a lot of yelling from her, punctuated with the occasional variation of fuck. I asked her to use professional language, then put her on hold to get to a supervisor as is the policy with abusive customers. She hung up before I could fill out the notes to them, but called back and (according to the notes) talked to a supervisor about getting me fired. But so far, so good. Honestly, I meant it to come out more like, \"If you can work a calculator I can walk you through how to program a remote\" but I shouldn't have tried it with this caliber of stupid. -Shrug- Lesson learned.",

I reach down to brush it off.\n\n&gt;Me: Now plug the router back in -AAAAAAAAAH!\n\nWhen I looked at my foot, there was a four foot long, black Kingsnake crawling across it.

(moar violent, and vulgar swears followed)\n\nI dropped my cell to the ground (calls were directed to a cell I was granted for work) jumped about for four minutes. Literally dodging this snake and eventually charging out of my room and tucking a towel under the door to trap it in.\n\nAnother 5 minutes later, my brother (who owned the snake, but somehow left the cage unlocked) came into the room, effortlessly recaptured the snake, taunted me, and then left.\n\nI composed myself.

I want to share crazy #2 of the day.\n\nHe asked me why he received a bill when he just paid. I told him the bill was prepared before we received your payment so you do not owe on the that bill. This was in the first 3 minutes of the call.\n\nHe says to me, \"No, no no, you are not listening to me!

(I also reached out to them over our work IM and they said they had to call the police on him, so he is not aloud in his local branch and he is not allowed to call them.)

He starts yelling that I am not listening to him yet again. \n\nHe says I have the worst customer service after I tell him I cannot help him if he is not going to listen to what I am saying. \n\nHe tells me to cancel his services with us. I tell him I absolutely will but that I would like him to understand what is happening with his bill. I tell him I will call billing and get back to him. \n\nCall billing and get the answer I already know. \n\nCall him back, this time he for some reason thinks I am a different person than the \"rude lady he just spoke with\" and tells me if that \"rude lady\" had just told him this (that he already paid) it would have been fine.\n\nHang up with him and get new crazy person who for some reason, cannot understand a monthly billing cycle.\n\nTLDR; Guy gets answer he needs in the first 3 minutes. Tells me I am not listening to him, because that is apparently not the right answer. Call him back after speaking with billing, and this time he thinks I am a different person. I tell him the same thing, he says thank you to me and says the other \"rude lady\" should have just told him that. ",

It's supposed to be a tech support job but it mostly involves taking transfers from customer service agents when they don't feel like dealing with the customer any longer.\n\nSo I had a customer that has dropped calls in his home in a metropolitan area. I pulled up a coverage map and there's a big ass  spot over his neighborhood, my company knows that he isn't going to have service and let him know that. He gets a survey and ranks me and the company poorly. \n\nMy supervisor says that I should have told the customer that I will create a ticket so that the network team to alert them of the issue and to see what improvements we can make. Unfortunately there are two problems with this response.\n\n* The network team already knows of the issue. And my supervisors know that a network ticket never fixes coverage issues. The response states there's a coverage issue in the area and service will be less than perfect. That's when a coverage issue isn't on the map, when an issue is on the map they ticket comes back with a negative response and your supervisor gets a negative email about you wasting the network team's time.\n\n* I also had a training that detailed this exact same scenario. If a customer is in a known bad coverage area you do not create a ticket. It gives the customer false hope, wastes the customer's time  the network team's time and mine. It also delays giving the customer bad news for a few hours or days but it still results in them that this issue won't be fixed.\n\nMy supervisors said that I am in the real world and that I shouldn't rely on training. I said that I shouldn't use the coverage tool and that I should ignore all of my training it it will prevent a bad survey or the customer calling back within a few days. They said that I was being dramatic and that I need to follow their instructions.\n\nI don't know how much longer I can take this job. I have conflicting information and whenever I pick the method of what I'm supposed to or what will work I almost always pick the wrong option.\n\nI have to find a new job.",

I got a bilingual account for an american phone network company. First week was accent training, because we speak spanish as native language here. First day our trainer welcomes us, give us a tour through the facilities, we visit the floor. He gives us a speech about the bonuses and that the company let's you \"grow\" as in become a supervisor, trainer, all that, and then he goes \"it only takes 3 months to leave the phones\". Well now I think, it was an incentive but honestly all I could think of was \"really? am I gonna hate picking up the phones so much that I will compete with my coworkers to get out in 3 months?\". Later would I know of the dreaded \"metrics\" speak for you.\n\nThe thing that got me out was when we actually took calls lol the training was childish but whatever, when I started taking calls I knew I wouldn't be able to keep the metrics without cheating, and by that I mean tricking the Avaya, rushing the customers and overall giving kind yet mediocre assistance. Managers, trainers and supervisors with visit us from day to day telling us their story (basically how they left the career they were studying because they earn better here). One could say these people are successful by my country's salary standard, yet they always look nervous, drained and tense. But still, I kept my optimism, then I logged in 1 minute late and they gave me a verbal warning, seriously, they back this up by saying time is money blabla, I was f***ing peeing c'mon... that was ridiculous, but that was the way they want you to be in that job, so uptight all the time. If I had kids or many monthly bills I'd probably still be there.\n\nI didn't do anything fancy to quit, I just followed the procedure, handed my letter along with my badge and headset and filled a little form. Was it just my experience or is it common to see the people working for some time at a call center with a defeated expression? I don't regret quitting, but you think I took things too personal and should've just not cared? Cause that'd be hard for me\n\ntl:dr got out for many reasons but last trigger was the military-like timing demand. is it common for callcenter workers to appear defeated?",

My most awkward one goes like this:\n\nA customer calls up wanting to cancel her services, explaining that she is divorcing her husband so cannot stay with us anymore, even though she likes the product.\n\nI ask her if she could keep it at a more affordable price. She then starts sobbing, but very quietly as if she doesn't want to be heard, then tells me this long story about how she's a long term victim of domestic abuse and she's running away with the kids secretly.\n\nNow, I'm not good with crying women at the best of times, never mind serious issues like this. Trying my best to be consoling and genuinely emphatic I say this line: \"Well, it must be tough, **you seem pretty beat up about it**\"...\n\nShe pauses, I pause. It dawns on me what I just said... 5 seconds later she carries on sobbing, but even harder, orders me to cancel her account and hangs up the phone without another word.\n\nI felt like a really bad person.",

        "text": "I've worked in the tech support department For a large cell provider for the the past 8 months. The training period was around 3-4 months long. About halfway through the training period I realized that I made a terrible mistake. \n\nOnce I hit the floor I confirmed that I shouldn't have taken the job. Many days I often feel like a slave. I see supervisors taking unscheduled breaks to go smoke and to buy food. But on the flip side agents are told don't drink water throughout the day because then you'll need an unscheduled lunch break.  And that's only part of the problem. \n\nCustomers want you to give them the world. Free cell phones and removing high data charges are things that I cannot do. I'm often yelled at and threatened because people think that I'm unwilling to fully assist them. First I'm unable to because it's outside of the company policy and then I'm unwilling after I'm screamed and cursed at. I don't think I can take it anymore. \n\nI took the job because I was promised a raise around the one year mark; but I've met many people that have passed that point and still haven't gotten their raise. Promotions are few and far between too. On the interview I was tood that I was strictly tech, towards the end of the year we were told that we have to offer customers certain products. Now it's part of my job agreement. I never would've took the job if I knew this would happen. This job really does depress me. \n\nOn days that I work I stay in bed until the very last moment before I have to get ready for work. And on weekends I stay home because I just feel so drained. From having to be mentally *on* throughout the week. I would like to get out and date but my personality has changed so much since I got the job I don't even know myself anymore. I can't even find the energy to cook because I'm so drained and it's so late when I get home. Every night it's McDonald's or Chick Fil A\n\nI need to find another job. This one is going to kill me.

Thing is, from what I've read, y'all work in primarily large corporation call centers. My situation varies slightly. I work for what I would call a small/big company (nearly $1 billion in 2014). We recently launched a website and published our phone number online. Previously, we could only be reached by a network of brick-and-mortar product dealers. Currently, my job requires I be on phones, do live chat, and answer emails. Does anyone else have to work in this sort of position? Anyone else a Live Chat rep? My team is tiny -- only 7 full time reps with rotating part timers. Are any other folks in similar situations? \n\nAnd seeking some advice from a CS n00b - HOWW do you care about helping some people, but let the shitheads roll off your shoulders? Do you go to work wholly apathetic everyday? Or try and turn it on and off? Does it get easier? Do I want it to get easier? I'm interested in staying with the company long term - it's a solid place to work. But the job itself is just incredibly trying. And I'm struggling. \n\nIt's been hard. I appreciate any insight. ",

I work a three hours a night, three times a week, at this job. Usually in that time, I handle 7-10 calls.\n\nToday I handled 2. One of which was a 2 hour and 35 minute marathon.\n\nMrs. X calls up, looking to cancel her services. Mrs. X is about as polite as a fart in an elevator. I go through the usual legal data stuff with her and get into her account. \"So, why is it you're looking to cancel tonight Mrs.X?\"\n\nBarely a half a second had passed between me asking the question and her starting, but I was met with what can only be described as the tortured screams of a banshee in heat. After I've persuaded her to pass her husband over (who wasn't much better but at least he was able to form sentences) I was able to ascertain the four reasons they wished to cancel;\n\n* \"My bill is £40 higher than it usually is, for no reason(sic)\".\n* \"The box for the TV doesn't work properly.\"\n* \"The content is a load of ~~censored~~.\"\n* \"The Internet doesn't work.\"\n\nAfter about 40 more minutes, I manage to gather the following;\n\n* The bill is £40 higher because Mr.X has been purchasing PPV Porn through his TV without telling Mrs.X. \n* The box works absolutely fine, but the viewing card was not inserted properly (Mrs.X had removed it after a fight to annoy him).\n* The content was fine, but not viewable because the viewing card was not inserted, so they had only freeview channels.\n* The internet was fine, green lights all the way, but their computer was a piece of S and about 17 years old, and no longer worked.\n\nI explain all this to them, and they tell me it's my fault somehow that all this had happened, and that Mr.X had decided to download pron instead of make love to his banshee, I mean wife. That it was my fault they didn't insert their viewing card properly and it's my fault that their PC was around for Y2K.\n\nThis goes back and forth for about half an hour, and we come to cancellation. They can't be saved and finally make the formal request to cancel. It is at this point I inform them they are in a contract for 12 months, of which 9 months still remain, and should they wish to leave, they will have to pay £190 upfront, plus the £40 for PPV up front, plus their standard £75 bill in arrears and that the reasons stated for cancelling are not the fault of **provider** so are not exempt.\n\nQue more banshee wails. \n\nIn the end, after 20 minutes of arguing it (and losing), they declare that they are suing me (not **provider**, me).\n\n\"Okay, thank you for that Sir, but I regret to inform you that **provider** is regulated by strict guidelines, and all threats of legal action are taken seriously and dealt with according to set procedures. As you have made this threat of legal action to myself, acting on behalf of *provider*, I am no longer able to take this call, and must now transfer you to our legal department immediately. Unfortunately, their office is now closed, so you will have to await a call from them tomorrow. Good evening and thank you for calling **provider**...\" *click*\n\n\nTL;DR: Customers call up to cancel because they had unplugged their services, used an old PC and had purchased £40 worth of PPV porn, then threaten to sue.\n\nedits: Formatting, grammar and adding TL;DR.",

        "text": "So I mentioned this story in a thread earlier, and apparently it's piqued people's interest. Also tried posting earlier in /r/talesfromtechsupport, and it's been pointed out that it's better suited here.  So here goes.\n\nEarly to mid 2000's, working at an online retailer that mightily made the transition from catalog sales to online. Went from being a small division of a much bigger company to actually buying out their parent company, getting into the Fortune 1000 in the process. There was a pretty major disconnect from upper management and the grunts on the floor, so I found myself at one point trying to hire and train 50 technical support reps for a new division of the company that was going live in 30 days. All while managing the email team of 5 people AND customer service, which was another 50.\n\nWell one of those customer service reps is the focus of our story today. Let's call her Becky, because I really don't remember her name, but I know it's not that. Becky was that person that every corporation has...that rare person that's made themselves basically bulletproof. She managed this by working a second job at a liquor store and bringing her managers all kinds of free samples, and letting them use her employee discount to buy at cost. My desk at some times looked like a bar. She was also extremely attractive, and had a habit of walking into the call center manager's office and showing off whatever underwear (or lack of) she was wearing that day.\n\nNow I will say this. The girl wasn't scared to work. I can honestly say that she was one of the most competent people that ever worked for me at that place. Kept her head down, did whatever was asked of her, shitty customers, horribly complex issues, stupid paperwork, she excelled at it.\n\nBut she had...issues. I had to write her up once because she felt it necessary to decorate her cubicle. With pictures of herself. In various states of undress. Nothing pornographic, but close. Another time I had to ask her to stop passing around the photo album of herself being the focus of a foursome. One day she came to me and told me she had to leave, like five minutes after she got to work. I told her 'it's busy, what's going on?'. She looked me right in the face and said 'well I just started my period and I'm not wearing any underwear'. Still makes me shudder thinking about it.\n\nAnd she had RIDICULOUS 'appetites'. She worked her way through customer service, tech support, marketing, you name it and she'd done them. But we couldn't just get rid of her, cuz 1. she was like I said pretty much bulletproof, and 2 she worked her ass off, and I couldn't throw that away.\n\nWell one day we're working, and all of a sudden you can hear a murmur from the sales floor...like a million voices went 'daaaaaamn' all at once, then went silent. My phone rings. VP of Sales. \"Ini get to my office NOW\". Fuck. What did I do now?\n\nSo I get into his office right behind the HR director. CEO, President, call center manager already in there. Shit is about to go down. I apparently look like a deer in the headlights, VP tells me 'sit down, you didn't do anything. You're going to tho'. We sit down, he pulls up an email on his projector. Email is from Becky, to one of the top sales reps in the company. We'll call him Bob. Email reads something to the effect of:\n\n&gt;Bob,\n\n&gt;It was great that you were able to ditch your wife last night. I really enjoyed the sex. Think you can do it again tonight?\n\n&gt;Becky\n\nNow it was a not-so open secret (to everybody but his wife, who also worked in our sales department) that she had settled down with him as her latest FWB. The problem here is that she had sent this email to Bob, but had 'inadvertently' cc'd our sales distribution list. Including his wife. So it's my job to go get her and bring her into this meeting where she's going to meet her doom.\n\nI liked this chick. Really did. (Not in that way, she was a FILTHY human being) Wasn't too many people I could depend on at $11.85/hr, but she was one of them. So I brought her into the office, but tried to put her in the 'appropriate' mindset. 'Lot of people's email getting hacked lately. Sure hope my people lock their keyboards when they step away from their desk'. She nodded at me and said 'yea that would be a shame for somebody to send an email pretending they were somebody else.'.\n\nSo we walk into the VP's office, she sees the email on the screen, and says 'well I'm fucked, huh?' VP kinda chuckles, and says 'well do you have anything to say?' My face drops when she says 'well he was the best fuck I've had in a while, sorry that I sent it to sales. Am I fired?' Sure enough, I end up escorting her to her desk, then out the door.\n\nCompany ended up having to pay for marriage counselling for the two sales reps, I had to have a meeting with all of my employees explaining that while there's no company policy against relationships between coworkers, what happens outside the office needs to stay there, and that non-work related emails can result in sanctions up to and including termination. Most embarrassing meeting I've ever had.\n\nIf there's interest, I may post a couple more stories about this place. Was like walking into Sunnyvale Trailer Park. Always a shitstorm brewing.\n\nTL;DR Don't shit where you eat.",

Because I didn't appreciate being written up that time that I had strep throat, or when I had the flu, but a writeup over time that a doctor *ordered* me to miss because I'd managed to contract something that *kills people* was pushing things.\n\nAnd HR tells me that I shouldn't look at these things as a punishment but instead as a \"documentation process.\" And that, if they reach the stage where they're thinking about firing me, *then* they'll look back at exactly why I got these writeups, and of course my job'll be safe. \n\nWhich is not comforting. \n\nHR went on to say that anyone can get a doctor's note these days, to which I offered to go and fetch them the x-rays of my lungs.\n\n\"I don't know if you're trying to be funny, but no.

        "text": "I work as the secretary for a business. I don't want to go into too much detail due to anonymity and privacy, but it's not exactly retail - it's a business where we provide a service, are paid by the hour, and have a minimum retainer amount. Essentially, our company spends most of the hours researching/improving the request of the client, and then we create the final product for them.  95% of the work though, is the researching part, which is why we charge by the hour and have a minimum retainer/hours amount (very similar to a law office). We are a booming business and have a hard time keeping up with all the work coming our way (which is why I was hired a couple months ago and why we're adding so many more employees). Most people who call in end up purchasing more than our minimum retainer amount, so the minimum is usually not an issue.  I handle all initial new customer calls and help get them started if they are interested in working with us.  \n\nThis morning started off in a terrible way. I got a call from a huge fucking asshole. We're getting a lot of these sorts of calls this week since we just started a couple new marketing campaigns.  This call lasted over 15 minutes and I spoke a total of 10 lines during the entire thing.  The caller essentially wanted us to skip the research part and just have us create the final product at a hugely slashed fee, which we can't do - because we have a minimum retainer. \n\nCaller: *I work for an honorable judge who works for the US government.  He has already done all his research and just wants it printed in a nice fashion.  He's a very important man and I'm not going to tell you his name because you could google him and he's too humble, he's not braggadocious at all and I don't want you looking him up.  He's a very smart man and very important and he's also an admiral in the navy and he's related to the royal family of Norway - when he's visiting Norway, he's considered a prince. He's already had his research done because I did it for him because he's such a good man, I wanted to have it printed out nicely for him.*\n\nMe: *Oh, that's very nice of you.  Well, here we can do that for you but our business here is mainly to do the research and because of that, we have a minimum retainer amount. [I explained to him the amount.]*\n\nCaller:  [this part goes on for about 14 minutes straight, no interruptions from me] *THAT'S your retainer amount? I know you're uneducated and young so you have no concept of how businesses work, but if you keep up those high prices, you will certainly go bankrupt.  The honorable judge is a very important man - he's an admiral! He's celebrated as a prince in Norway! and that's NORWAY, not Germany or Switzerland.  He isn't vain about his accomplishments, but he's a very important man!!! You have solicited him with your emails and commercials! You can't solicit someone and then charge outrageous prices! You will go out of business.  I have been working longer than you've been alive. I have 6 years of college and 4 degrees.  You need to listen to me when I say you will go out of business and you are snubbing a highly decorated honorable judge and navy admiral and prince of norway! I know you're just a low level employee and don't understand all that, and you'll lie to make your company look better, but this is a serious problem that if you don't address, you will go out of business. You need to put your supervisor on the phone so you can change your business model and make a very powerful friend at the same time.*\n\nMe: *I'm sorry we can't provide what you're looking for.*\n\nCaller: [starts screaming] *how dare you not listen to me---*\n\nme: [hang up]\n\nSome people are so rude and entitled, I can't wrap my brain around it.  \n\nEdit: omg guys he sent in an email to our support email complaining that \"the girl on the phone\" hung up on him and didn't provide the product the commissioner/admiral wants. He sent it from his \"unofficial\" government email that was (slightly changed for privacy) commisionerciagovernment@gmail.com 😂😂😂 I'm dying guys\n\nedit: [ok, ok, here are some blanked-out (for privacy reasons) images of the email](http://imgur.com/a/sOXCf)",

Posting it here more as a therapeutic device rather than because I believe anyone wants to read it. \n\nTL:DR is man is elderly, makes me repeat everything, tells me stories about getting his PC fixed (I'm in a alcohol retailer) and other stuff. \n\nEnjoy.\n\n___\n\n\nMember called back concerning account on STOP and failed payment. Hadn't checked with his bank but did check with his daughter who advised him not to pay us until we had described the entire ordering process and where the payment had failed down on the original order in October. Did this in stages, went over each segment of placing an order multiple times whilst member wrote this all down and told exactly what I have access to when viewing the failed payment dialogue. \n\n\nMember asked if the problem could be that a man came to repair his computer monitor, I said that would not have affected a telephone order no. Member then told me step by step the details of how his computer monitor was taken away and how his desk looked empty without it. How the repairman brought it back and said some part of it was broken and couldn't be fixed and how he had a spare monitor he would charge the member £25 for. Member said how he thought this was suspicious as he couldn't even fix the monitor and was just trying to make a sale (I didn't tell member that it's odd he wasn't charged labour or that a replacement monitor should cost way more than £25 because it wasn't relevant to our query today). Member then told me how his phone was playing up and I needed to either speak as loud as I could (I was shouting already) or I should call him back on another line. Called member back. Continued speaking loudly but not as loudly as before. Member told me not to shout because it's rude. \n\n\nOnce i'd apologised for shouting I managed to steer the conversation back to the failed payment. Member offered a solution. That he attempt to pay the £75 again now. I said I thought this was a brilliant idea and took the payment.\n\n\nThis all took about 45 mins.\n\n\nMember then wanted to place another order. Got member taken off STOP and proceeded with order. Member made a point about telling me before he gave me any product codes that he would be buying one item that was his usual and another that was slightly more expensive. I said this was fine. We reached the end of the order and I told him the price. Member was astonished to find that this was more expensive than he usually had to pay. I advised that this is because he picked a wine that was slightly more expensive than what he usually buys. Member asked if we're charging for delivery because of this. I confirmed we are not. Member said he didn't understand why he was being charged more but said that he'd spent too much time already trying to sort this out and that he would just pay for the order and receive it when he received it (booked for next Monday, confirmed this with him 3 times). Member thanked me for my patience and said he hoped he doesn't have any problems with this order. I also hope this.\n\n\nEntire call length approximately 1hour 10mins.",

I was harassed for bringing bleach wipes to clean my desk for the day because of the \"no personal items on the floor\" shtick, the hilarious thing is they have a wipe station that sits empty because they \"aren't required to supply wipes\". I can't tell you how many times I've found blood among other things of varying size, color and frequencies on my desk. The health department has been called on them numerous times in the 13 months I've been there but nothing is ever done.\n\nI'm convinced that upper management are sadists who will harass you unmercifully if you don't kiss their ass I was vilified for getting sick, and my doctors note was refused had to go to the head of Hr to have the psychotic om put in their place.",
