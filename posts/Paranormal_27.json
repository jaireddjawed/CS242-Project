        "text": "       As of now, I‚Äôm 17(M) and I‚Äôve been seeking answers for a lot of unexplainable things, but one sticks out to me in particular from the first few years of my life and I know reddit is superb for consulting others to find answers on these sorts of subjects. \n\n       I don‚Äôt remember much of my early years which is fairly normal but I have vivid memories of being watched and scared by who I called the ‚Äúrock ladies.‚Äù I‚Äôll provide a detailed description but the fact that I remember them so clearly still, freaks me out. I know they weren‚Äôt all in my little child noggin because I could see AND feel them. \n\n       One of them was (assuming the best I can) about 6‚Äô7‚Äù the other was around 5‚Äô6‚Äù\nand had little to no body fat whatsoever. They were both white, with flesh and bones resembling that of a flying squirrel on their arms, the flesh connecting from their arms to chest was always ripped and tattered. They would try to talk with me, but I never understood. By that age, I spoke sentences well on my own so I knew that what they were speaking was not english. I can't describe what it sounded like and nor do I wish to remember. \n\n       The most prominent things, though, were the plethora of rocks lodged into their skin. They had little to no hair and eyes they bulged out plus the smile of a chain smoker. But the rocks were the freakiest part. They varied in size and the women were absolutely covered in them, never did I see them with any clothes on either. In my childhood home my room was a corridor across from my parents and I can vividly recall trying to get through the corridor at night to sleep with them because the ‚Äúrock ladies‚Äù were freaking me out. They‚Äôd scare me deliberately and when I would sleep on my parent‚Äôs floor they would stand over me and just watch. They went away around sunrise every morning. \n\n       They stopped appearing to me when I was around four and a half. I haven‚Äôt seen them again but it haunts me like crazy. I‚Äôm a total magnet for weird shit to go down, I‚Äôve seen and experienced things I wish I could explain but all of which I‚Äôve been able to let go of, even if they were objectively (far far far) scarier than the ladies. I have no ideas nor answers. They only touched me a few times but the feeling I could describe was feeling like where they touched, it would feel like ragged wood was being probed against me. They also had far more joints than the average person and could extend parts of their hands and necks. \n\n       That‚Äôs all of the information about them that I can recall. Keep in mind I had an entirely healthy childhood up until that point and had never seen or heard anything of the sort. If there are any ideas I would be over the moon to hear them out, this has been haunting me for over a decade and I‚Äôm positive it will continue to until I can get some answers.",

As a kid I used to sleep with the door open, so I left the door open as usual and went to bed that night. There was light bleeding from their living room/longue from their TV so the stairway opposite my room was dimly lit, not completely dark and I could still make out color and detail of wall pictures etc. Maybe about an hour after laying in bed facing the wall as I usually did, I turned round and I saw (what at the time I thought) was my friends mother standing on the middle of the stairs so I could see only her upper torso, she was staring at me with a completely emotionless and blank expression. I could make out the clothes she was wearing, the direction her hair was angled  and everything in pretty good detail considering the lighting. She was staring at me directly in my eyes and I was staring back mainly because I felt really uneasy considering i was a child sleeping in bed and i didnt want to take my eyes off her incase something happened, after about 10 minutes I decided to get up and go and see what she wanted. It was only about 6ft from the door of my room to where she was standing, and by the time I got to the top of the stairs she had just gone, literally like she just demanifested into thin air before my eyes, I never took my eyes off her once except to blink. Confused I went downstairs to see if she was there and she was just watching TV in the longue with her husband, so I went back to bed. About an hour later I woke up feeling the same uneasiness, and I look out of the door and she was there again and this event repeated itself. After this one, I fell asleep until the morning. \n\nTLDR: Saw a 'ghost' of my friends very much alive mum in fairly good lighting\n\nI have no idea what I could have possibly saw, does anyone have any ideas?",

I was always easily scared at that age, probably around 6 or 7 years old, so I would often crawl into my mother's bed after a bad dream or something.\n\nAnyway, I remember laying in the queen-sized bed, my mother was on the phone at the time, and I was bored, so I crawled down until the duvet covered my face, and suddenly I was dragged down the bed by the ankles. I could feel the cold hands of whatever was grabbing me, and when i sat up and pulled off the duvet, no one was around, and my mother was still on the phone, only she was looking at me as if she expected that to have been completely random. I even told her what happened and checked the foot of the bed to see if someone was there. No one was. I told her, and she shrugged it off. The bed itself doesn't have space for someone to crawl under it, the mattress base only had a few centimeters of space from the ground, and to this day, it still creeps the ever-living shit out of me at 18 years old.

        "text": "I used to live by a cemetery\n\nI used to live by a cemetery, I could see it from my bedroom window.\n\nSome nights I would look out at it in boredom, willing in my mind for something to happen, something other worldly to appear.\n\n\nNothing ever happened, of course, it remained dark and empty. No zombies or ghosts ever appeared, but it was a game I played with myself. Stupid but fun.\n\nThat night was different, though that was the night everything changed.\n\nAs the years went by and I grew older, my fascination with the cemetery waned as childhood curiosities do.\n\nFor whatever reason, though, as I was getting ready for bed, something drew me to the window. When I looked at the cemetery, I saw that there was a light emanating from the ground, at the center of the headstones.\n\nI tried to figure out where it was coming from, a car, a flashlight, maybe somebody had lit a candle?\n\nI dismissed every explanation and decided to go and find out what the light was. In all the years I lived there, I had never seen anybody on its grounds. The headstones were so old that they jutted from the earth crooked and yellow, they looked like they would crumble if you touched them.\n\nThe moon was huge, there were no stars, and the air was crisp and sweet. It was unpleasantly cloying, like fruit gone bad.\n\nIt had rained earlier in the day, and mud squished beneath my feet. My heart thumped in my chest painfully, and anticipation rushed through my veins.\n\nThere is something serene about being in a cemetery at night. I have been here dozens of times and never found it scary. This night felt different, though. I felt different.\n\nIt was as though this was the moment in my life that I had been waiting for. \n\nThe light was brighter, and there were more of them. They weren‚Äôt coming from the ground as I thought, but rather from each headstone. \n\nThe epitaph‚Äôs glowed as white as angel wings. I read the one nearest to me, and it said:\n\nBaby\n0000 - 0000\n\n\nUnderneath it, in red paint, was a crude drawing of a stork with a distended stomach.\n\nI frowned. I had never seen this one before, and it‚Äôs not as though you would forget a thing like that. \n\nI checked the one closest to it, and it was the same date. It said:\n\nChild\n1111-1111\n\nUnderneath it was another drawing. This time it was a smiley face, but where the eyes should have been there were only X's.\n\nMy heart was beating even faster, and my mouth had gone bone dry. I watched as the words on the stone grew darker until they bled a crimson red. \n\nI made to run, and that‚Äôs when I saw her. It was a human hunched over a grave, her eyes fixed on me hungrily, and as she smiled at me, I saw how unnaturally wide her mouth was. \n\nThe woman straightened, and I heard bones snap. She leered at me, and I screamed as she began to limp towards me on broken feet. Her gait was slow, but purposeful.  \n\nShe was very tall and very thin. Her skin was the color of fresh paper, and her hair was wild and white like snow. Her fingers were hooked into claws, they looked like the talons of a bird. \n\nI was frozen in place, I forgot how to breathe, and as she came closer and closer to me, I saw just how wide her mouth was, and God she had so many teeth.\n\n\nI don‚Äôt know how she could see me, because she had no eyes. There were only empty black sockets, half full with dirt.\n\nMy paralysis broke, and I turned and ran. I ran out of the cemetery and into my house. I didn‚Äôt stop running until I reached my bedroom. \n\nMy blinds were still open, but there was no way I would close them tonight. I could feel her underneath my window, staring up at me with those horribly empty eyes.\n\nI don‚Äôt remember falling asleep, but the sun woke me. It was so bright outside that I felt like crying in relief, and I rushed to close the blinds.\n\nI can‚Äôt lie, I did look and saw nothing.\n\nThe cemetery was as it always looked. Peaceful. Empty.\n\nFrom then on, I never looked out my window at night. I kept my window closed and brought black out curtains, so nothing could look in at me either.\n\nI moved out a few days ago, I had graduated and was excited to be going away for college. \n\nIt had been a year since my excursion into the cemetery, and my senior year was so busy that I forgot about it. It was so surreal, so otherworldly terrifying, that I convinced myself that it was a bad dream, even though deep down I knew it wasn‚Äôt.\n\nI was more than happy when me and my parents finished packing and finally drove off. Of course, I couldn‚Äôt help but peek at the cemetery one last time.\n\nNothing. There was nothing there. If I hadn't just imagined it, at least I had gotten away. I was going far from the cemetery. I let out a breath that I didn't realize I had been holding in for the better part of the year.\n\nAt least, that‚Äôs what I thought. \n\nYou see, I have been having strange dreams lately. In my dreams, it‚Äôs always night. There are no stars, only the moon, and it is the color of fresh dark blood.\n\nThat woman is there. She stands in front of me, smiling that wide toothy grin. She dips her finger into something I thought was paint, but now I see her palms are bleeding. She is drawing with her own blood.\n\nShe is so close I can smell the rotting fruit on her breath, and her hair tickles my face. I am frozen in place as her canvas, so still as she draws clumsily on my forehead.\n\n‚ÄúMine,‚Äù she rasps. ‚ÄúMine.‚Äù It is all she ever says.\n\nWhen she is done, I wake up drenched in sweat.\n\nThis night was different, though. See, after she drew on my forehead, she grasped my shoulders with strong hands and turned me to face a headstone.\n\nIt looked new among the others, and in shining letters I saw my name, my birth date, and this year as the date of my death.\n\nBelow the epitaph drawn in her blood is a face with black eyes and a crooked mouth, which is made into a frown. \n\n\nI would just chalk it up to another nightmare, I mean what else could it possibly be? But when I woke up and went to the bathroom, I saw my reflection.\n\nOn my forehead is the face with empty sockets for eyes. When I touch it, my hand comes away wet and smeared with blood.\n\nI can hear her now, beneath my window, she‚Äôs calling for me.\n\n‚ÄúMine‚Ä¶‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMine.‚Äù\n\nI realize now that she‚Äôs marked me, and no matter where I go, she‚Äôll just follow. \n\nI used to live by a cemetery, and I‚Äôve learned that curiosity has many consequences and is best to leave the dead and their resting place alone.",

My cousins decided to take advantage of the occasion and play a game of hide and seek in the backyard. The atmosphere was filled with joy and excitement as we all ran around, trying to find the best hiding spots.\n\nThe architecture of our house is similar to that of two neighboring houses. We have a large front yard, and on one side is a Kachari house, which can also be referred to as a sitting room. Beyond the old courtyard lies a small road that leads to the surrounding area. At the time, the road was lined with many trees, all of which were cut down and taken to the sawmill the following day.\nAt the start of the game of hide and seek, it was my duty to locate everyone. As the players scattered, the atmosphere became eerily quiet. I scoured the area, my eyes darting around for any sign of movement. Suddenly, I spotted a woman wearing a black veil striding down the street. It was the neighbor's aunt, a devout woman who often went to different places to receive Taaleem (Islamic education). I called out to her, but she didn't respond.\n\nI approached the woman in the black veil cautiously, but before I could react, she spun around and gave me a powerful shove, sending me sprawling. When I looked up, I was met with a face that I had never seen before - a face that was so terrifying that I couldn't help but scream. My cousins rushed out upon hearing my cries, followed by our guardian. After hearing my story, they searched the area thoroughly, but to no avail - the mysterious figure had vanished.\n\nIt has been quite some time since then, and there have been no issues. The issue arose precisely two years later, in 2009. I was in my tenth grade at the time. My favorite subject was computer. So I joined the computer class beforehand. Which takes twenty three minutes to go from our village. I used to come and go by bicycle every day. One day I was coming after class. The time is a little before the Maghrib call to prayer. On the way there was a monastery or temple opened by the Hindus. I saw a friend of mine standing in front of the opening of that monastery.\nI exclaimed, \"What the heck? Why are you just standing here?\" My friend glanced at me and replied in a soft voice, \"For no reason.\" \"Come on, I'll take you home.\" \"Okay, let's go.\"\n\nI was cycling with my friend behind me, and after a while, it felt like there was something incredibly heavy behind my bicycle. I was much heavier than my friend, so I assumed it was a mistake in my mind. Then, the Maghrib Azan began and it felt like there was no one behind me anymore, and the bike became much lighter. I looked back and saw my friend sitting there, and everything was normal. I said a lot but he didn't answer. Eventually, we arrived at my friend's house.\n\nHis house is situated in the middle of a vast field, with a bench nestled beside a coconut tree. My friend informed me, \"No one is home; they all went to Nanabari (grandfather's house). Why don't you take a seat here? I'll be back shortly with a Dub (green coconut) from home.\" \n\nAfter I had been sitting for a while, my friend brought the Green coconut. We were enjoying our beverages together when he suddenly asked me, \"Do you know this place?\"  \"Why don't you recognize it? This is your home - the road in front of the house.\" \"Who said this? Well, don't you know me?\"  \"Don't be silly.\" \"Take a good look at me and tell me if you recognize me.\" \"Why are you doing this to me?\" My body froze in place. I saw him leaning against the bench, his long hair cascading down his back, his body covered in thick fur, and his face twisted in a grotesque expression.\nThe moonlight illuminated him, and I began sprinting in terror. As I raced into the field, I noticed numerous rat burrows and craters scattered across the terrain. Suddenly, a hand emerged from one of the holes and yanked my leg. I freed the leg with great difficulty, and I had no idea how long I had been running. Eventually, I heard the call to prayer, and then a menacing voice from behind. After sprinting for a short distance, I collided with a man and tumbled to the ground, and I passed out. Fortunately, he was an Imam of a nearby mosque. \n\nHuzoor ushered me into the mosque with a few of the worshippers who were accompanying him. Upon seeing the scratches and wounds that covered my body, he attempted to staunch the bleeding. After reciting some surahs over me, I regained consciousness. I recounted the entire incident to him, and after reciting something else, he blew into a glass of water and gave it to me to drink. Finally, Baba escorted me home from the mosque.\n\nAfter returning home, I phoned my friend and discovered he was at Nana's house. Later, I was informed by a Hafez that a Jinn  named Kali had followed me from the temple, by taking the form of my friend.",

        "text": "      I had an experience years ago that really freaked me out. I‚Äôve always been skeptical of ghosts and similar phenomena and I‚Äôm not religious, but this is one of the oddest things I‚Äôve ever experienced. Years ago, probably around 2014, I was visiting family in Colorado. That side of my family is into the paranormal, especially ghosts. Something we do when we meet up is use a ‚Äúghost box‚Äù, which I‚Äôm sure many of you are familiar with. For those who aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a radio that scans across channels very quickly and supposedly picks up the voices of spirits. Not the most technical definition, but just to cover the basics. \n      Anyways, we decided to use it one night but didn‚Äôt have anything interesting happen. So, we instead decided to swap ghost stories in the backyard, which I always enjoy. Well, about half an hour into our discussion my brother starts feeling nauseous. He‚Äôs saying weird things and acting possessed, which I thought was a cheesy (and not very funny) joke. He‚Äôs pretty funny usually, so I knew something was wrong when the ‚Äújoke‚Äù was going on for too long. Besides, our interests in the paranormal are typically limited to ghost stories, tarot readings, and energy. Needless to say, this was not in our wheelhouse of typical or expected outcomes. \n      My aunt decided to cleanse the area with some sage but he was saying it smelled like burning bodies, which isn‚Äôt the most comforting thing to hear. Some time goes by and he feels more normal, but still nauseous. At this moment, suddenly, there was a blue ball of light (maybe a foot or less in diameter) across the yard and past their fence, into their alleyway. I saw the light lower slowly towards the ground, shrinking as it descended. Descended seems to be the proper word, as it didn‚Äôt seem to be falling as it was much too slow. The ball of light got smaller and smaller until it touched the ground, remained stationary for a few seconds, then went out. There was no noise and it seemed to just ‚Äúpop‚Äù up out of nowhere. \n      Nobody said a word until it was over, which is when we started freaking out all over again. We searched the next morning for anything that could have caused the light but there was nothing. We have a few brain cells between the few of us and ruled out flashlights, flares, reflections, etc. My aunt and cousin claim to be more ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù to energy, and stated that it was quite intense during the experience. \n\n      Any thoughts on what this could have been? I can‚Äôt remember if it had been storming, but maybe it was ball lightning? No clue. Please feel free to share below! We still have no idea what happened that night.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,  I need advice.  I live in a house that was built over 125 years ago, that we have been renovating slowly but steadily for several years.  Upon moving in we tore down some walls, took up carpet, etc. Within a month I was outside in my car, calling my husband because I heard someone walking on our staircase calling my name. I had grabbed my infant, phone, snagged keys and a knife in the kitchen and was out the door. \n\nWe've heard organ music, which the previous owner used to play in church. We've heard heavy, booted footsteps on our attic steps, and more walking on the staircase.  All of the kids have seen shadows, and have heard someone walking at night while everyone is asleep.  \n\nI get it. Houses have history,  the previous family was here for 6 decades. That's fine. As long as it isn't malicious then it's whatever. \n\nUntil this week. We had negative 40 temps and took down plaster and lathe to add insulation.  While doing so we took down part of a wall to reinforce our daughter's room with extra support beams. Since then, something is PISSED.\n\n Here's a breakdown of the past 7 days. All 3 kids,  at different times of the day, different days, and entirely independently of one another have told us they saw a shadow that they thought was their dad. All 3 saw it in the same general area next to the wall we took down.  Again, not too bad, just kinda eh. However,  I'm now having literal spontaneous scratches and bites showing up on my arms. I took fleece pajamas upstairs,  on my way down I felt a burning on the inside of my arm. 2 sets of 3 scratches, all roughly 2.5-3 inches long and perfectly symmetrical were developing.  Tonight I came back upstairs after just turning on the dryer. I had a sharp stinging on my outer wrist, and what looks like a possible bite is there. I've thought I was maybe biting my wrist in my sleep because I had another on my other wrist 3 days ago, this looks identical.  \n\nI have eggshells, cinnamon,  sage and salt for my doorways.  I have infused sage spray that I've been using liberally.  What else can I do? Does it sound like a normal haunting? Like I said,  sounds and shadows are fine, but hurting someone is too far. The previous owners were EXTREMELY devout Catholics, and we are absolutely not religious- my husband is atheist,  I'm more spiritual/pagan oriented.  We both come from very religious families though. Any thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated.",

I've gotten a random free reading from my father over tiktok Live with a talented medium. She just out of the blue called out his name and told me many details she couldn't possibly know. I believe in spirits. I think he sends me signs too.\n\nLast night we got in the mail a men's silver wedding band that is engraved \"with you in your dreams\" on the outside and \"4 Lor with you always XOX\".\n\nMy mom has a following on social media for work and it's not uncommon she is sent random gifts. But this one was really personal. My father always called my mother Lori, Lor. He was poked at for how he called out to her with his new york accent and it sounded like \"Law\".  My friends would imitate him. No one calls my mom Lor except him. If it was just a typo then I still think it holds meaning. \n\nAlso my mom has been having night terrors recently, like in the last 2 weeks. She had sleep paralysis once and it was scary for her. She would ask my dad to visit her in her dreams every night. She only told my older sister about this recently. And to suddenly get this ring saying he is with her in her dreams? \n\nWho would send a grieving widow such a personal gift? Seems really weird if it was from a stranger. And if you go through the trouble of engraving something, you'd think they would double check the spelling of everything. There was no nice message with it. My dad also didn't have time to plan this before he passed. \n\nI emailed who I *think* is the manufacturer of the ring, it didn't come with a lot of information. Hope to hear from them soon and if they can tell me any information on it. \n\nIs that even possible?",

All we have is a loud recording from her baby monitor.\n\nMost Recent. Yesterday around 11:00pm-11:30pm we again heard someone knocking on the window to ‚ÄúShave and a Haircut‚Äù.

OTW to Newnan, GA once, I stopped at a friends house for a visit because I hadn‚Äôt seen them in years. This particular friend had a very alternative lifestyle and dibbled and dabbled into a lot of things. While at their house, I was very uncomfortable. I have always been in tune with my spirit and it was in an uproar in this house. I couldn‚Äôt even sit down. I stood the entire time and made up an excuse as to why I had to leave earlier than planned. \n\nThat night I got settled into my hotel room and began to doze with the tv on, which I rarely do. As I‚Äôm dozing, I can tell I‚Äôm not alone. I look to the foot of my bed and see a dark figure, tall, lanky, with long fingers that came to a point (I‚Äôm scaring the shit outta myself just recalling this). The figure begins to pace in front of the bed, dragging those long fingers across the comforter as it paces. It was teasing me. I couldn‚Äôt move. It felt like sleep paralysis but while I could talk, I couldn‚Äôt move. Suddenly, it crouched down as if it were going to pounce on me so I closed my eyes as I felt something jump on the bed. I began to pray aloud and something told me to call out my friends name. I did and told him he couldn‚Äôt have my soul. I just KNEW to say that. I continued to pray. It got still and quiet. I opened my eyes and it was gone. \n\nI can‚Äôt explain it but something within me knew it came from my friends house. I had an incident with this same friend years later that confirmed it. That‚Äôs a crazy story as well. I don‚Äôt know what it was but it never came back.",

I had multiple nightmares all with a common theme, discover hidden chamber above my room, staircase leads to hidden basement, bloodthirsty monster resides within said basement and I let it out to ravage the house.  When I would wake up, I would feel something watching me.  Sometimes I would feel malicious intent, sometimes not.  The most intense phenomenon happened in that room like a seductive female voice saying ‚Äúdolphin boy‚Äù. I saw a shadow figure standing in my doorway one night.  We eventually moved but the feeling of being watched remained.  We moved again, the feeling remained.  After a couple of years at this house, the bop it would randomly activate as I was going to bed.  This happened so much we removed the batteries and put it in the laundry room.  Finally, my most terrifying experience, I woke up in the middle of the night to the intense feeling of being watched. At some point, I felt cold, icy fingers reach under my sheets and touch me.  It couldn‚Äôt have possibly been anyone in my family because my door was locked the whole time.  However I went to college and I no longer felt as if I was being watched at night.  My personal theory is that this entity from the first house latched onto one of my things.  What do y‚Äôall think? Paranormal or something mundane?",

        "text": "Hey, sorry in advance since english isn't my first language. This happened a few days ago and I don't really know where else to share it.\n\nIt was around 7:30 PM and I got a message from a friend asking me to help him out with his garbage. I didn't really understand it at first but thought maybe there was too much trash and he needed my truck(?) He lives a few miles away from the city and needs to take his trash out by car to a common dumping area since the garbage truck won't go up to his house. He does this daily on his way to work.\n\nI arrived there about 40 minutes later and he was on his porch area smoking a cigarette with a blank expression on his face. We hugged since it was some time since we last saw each other, you know how life tends to get in the way. I lit up a cigarette as well and he started explaining why he wanted my help. He put the trash out the night before and was explicit that there was nothing out of the ordinary with it, he lives alone so there wasn't much trash, and it was new since he drove the old trash out to that garbage area in the morning.\n\nA few hours later, he was watching TV and got startled by some noises coming from the back of the house, where he puts his trash. He didn't want any wild animals going through it so he got up to scare it away. After a few steps he heard something akin to a cat meowing, so he figured it was one of his neighbor's cats, they don't live that close to each other but you can see his house from my friend's porch. I've never seen him, but I've occasionally seen cats around my friend's house, and he always said they were from that neighbor. Anyways, my friend really likes cats, so he started \"talking\" to the cat while walking to the kitchen, where the door to the back is. When he was arriving at the back door he bumped into a beer bottle that was on the counter and it crashed on the floor.\n\nHe heard the cat screaming and when he opened the door he saw a dark shape dashing for the tree line. \"welp, he isn't coming back after that scare\" he said to himself as he was taking a look at the garbage. It looked normal and there weren't any apparent holes in the bags, so he went back inside, cleaned the glass from the floor, and threw it in the kitchen garbage. The next day he woke up and decided to empty his kitchen trash before taking it all to the dump area. As he opened his back door, the foulest stench hit his nose and he immediately started to gag.\n\nHe threw the kitchen trash bag next to the others and closed the door. He immediately went to the bathroom to throw up and decided to deal with it when he was back from work. We've been having quite a lot of rain for the past few days, so he thought it would help with the smell. Hours later he arrives home, already forgotten about the smell. As he opened the kitchen door, he was hit again with it, and it all came back to him.\n\nThe smell hadn't gone away, it had gotten worse, and was now inside his kitchen. He threw up on the floor, didn't have time to go to the bathroom this time. He decided to go around the house to see what the hell was wrong with his trash, and from afar, he almost puked for the third time, all the bags had holes in them, and there were maggots all around. He ran back to the front of the house, and thought a bit about it, how was it possible for the fresh garbage to be in that state after just one day? Doesn't really matter, he just needed it fixed, so he sent me the message and didn't leave his porch\n\nThis friend was startled really easily, he always jumped when watching horror movies, so I thought that maybe he was exaggerating a bit about the smell and the maggots, maybe it was rice from a bag that spilled onto the others when the cat was going through them the night before. We finished our cigarettes and after a deep breath, he opened his front door and we got inside.\n\nThe living room had no smell at all, making me confident that it wasn't that bad. \"Actually, don't want to go around the house? I think the kitchen is unbearable right now\". \"Don't worry, man, let's see if there's anything wrong with the kitchen first, and then we can go around if need be\". Boy, how was I wrong.\n\nHe opened the kitchen door after a few seconds holding the door handle and gestured for me to go inside, as he got out of the way holding the door open. 1, 2, 3, and on the fourth step I froze, I could feel my nose, my mouth, my throat, everything burn with the most horrible smell I've ever felt.\n\nIt reminded me of one time when I was a child, and I and a few friends were riding our bikes through my uncle's property, but this time we went further than we ever had before. We came across a small house next to the woods and decided to knock, because I was sure that at this point we were no longer on my uncle's land, and we wanted to get permission to ride around there. As we rounded the house to get to the door, there was none, the place was abandoned and filled with animal carcasses. There was rotting flesh, bones, and flies everywhere. The air was heavy and humid and the smell unbearable. We got to our bikes and booked it back.\n\nEven that smell, rotten animals, blood, and death itself, couldn't come close to what I was feeling at that moment. I held my breath and ran back to the leaving room, shutting the door behind me. My friend looked at me with that \"I told you so\" look, and we started thinking about how to make it easier. The plan was to spray air freshener on some masks and wear smaller bags as gloves. After we prepared ourselves, we went out to go around the house. It was dark, so we couldn't see that much, we also couldn't turn that light on since the switch was in the kitchen, and no way in hell any of us would go in there again before getting rid of that smell.\n\nWe approached the garbage area and I help up my flashlight to get a better look. I was immediately struck with horror. That couldn't be normal, no way. I've seen garbage before, I've seen dumps before, but nothing came close to that. There were maggots all over the bags, their movement making the tiny reflections flicker. It was like looking at the night sky, pitch black from the bags combined with glistering white dots. I could see my friend press his mask to his face, hoping that the lavender smell could prevent him from throwing up.\n\nOur eyes squinted, it was involuntary, we could feel a little burn sensation and the tears coming. I put the flashlight between my neck and shoulder and held a new big garbage bag open while my friend tried to lift one of the rot-infested bags to put it inside the new one. He was trying to hold in places where there were no maggots or holes, but there were no empty areas to hold onto, as he tried to lift it, brown liquid started oozing from the holes. You could see several white dots falling into the dark pool that had formed under the bags, it was like sprinkling sugar into a black coffee. He managed to get a good grip on the bag, and I held my bag open for us to secure the trash, but as he was slowly lowering his bag, it started coming apart. To our luck, most of it fell into the new bag. We couldn't handle any more of the smell at that point, so we decided to take a break and ran back to the porch.\n\nKeep in mind that this ordeal couldn't have lasted more than 30 seconds. We took out our masks and started smoking our cigarettes, trying to get that awful odor out of our respiratory systems. \"Fuck it\" I said, my friend looked at me with terror in his eyes, I think he thought that I was going to leave him to deal with it alone. I took another hit off the cigarette and looked at him, \"Here's what we are going to do\", he listened intently, \"I'm gonna park my truck back there, we are gonna throw the bags on the back as fast as possible, just trying to now destroy them and spill everything. After that we will drive to that dumping zone and take everything out\", his eyes glowed with hope, and that's what we did, that part was still horrible and we almost threw up a lot, but this is getting too long and I still have things to tell.\n\nAfter driving to the dumping zone and back, my friend took a hose and we cleaned the back of my truck, we also tried to wash away the area where he kept his trash, it was concrete, so it all came out after some cleaning products and a lot of water. After that, we sat in his back area and started smoking again, I've never seen him more relieved, and to be fair, I was really relieved as well. There was still some odor in the air, but nothing close to whatever the hell that was before. We were discussing how bizarre it was, and with the light on this time, I was looking around the area and could see what looked like a path on his back lawn, it was surrounded by dying grass.\n\nI asked him what that was. He didn't know, so we went to have a closer look. It was a pathway of dead grass from his trash area to the woods. I held the flashlight up to it and could see what looked like paw prints on the wet soil, it looked like it was from a cat, but bigger, not much, but enough to make it weird. The weirdest part, however, was that every print was mirrored. Imagine if put your foot on the dirt, then turn 180 degrees on your heels and press your foot down again. I've never seen anything like that.\n\nMy friend said it was probably from his neighbor's cat, and that he came and went through that same path so the prints were overlayed on each other. I think that's highly unlikely since all prints we saw were like that, how would he step over all of his past prints? And how do we explain the trash being in the state that it was after only one day, with nothing out of the ordinary inside it? Or the weird rotten path formed from this house to the woods? Do you think that cat thing had something to do with the rotten garbage or was it attracted to it?\n\nI know this isn't all that scary and is more on the nasty side, but thinking about it all gives me the creeps. I can't seem to get that smell out of my nose and mouth, I've tried it all. My friend for some reason doesn't want to talk about this with our other friends, and I also don't understand that. Am I supposed to forget about the weird cat and rotten garbage? How? I can still smell it, I don't think I'll forget it that soon.",

        "text": "     Well this tale is a true and passing strange thing which happened and was witnessed by multiple people in multiple homes. I can only tell my part in it, and what I saw. It goes like this;\n\n  I was arriving at my little trailer deep in the heart of Tennessee from my job at a haunted Dollar Holler (a story for another day) and drove up the 1/4 mile driveway  that runs next to State Wildlife preserve. I pulled in front of our place and parked and greeted Jake, one of my red tick coon hounds, and let him off his lead to run to the porch as is his habit. But this time he acted out of character and ran off into the dark with me cussing at him and made a big circle around the 5 trailers and met me at the porch from the opposite side! I called him colorful names and he went in the house easy with the rest of the dogs and settled in for dinner, which is my habit to serve when I get home. Didn't think much of his behavior until later. I then made a simple meal for wifey and me and came into the bedroom to settle in for the night with her and maybe watch some Netflix before drifting off, unaware that the whole time we were being.... observed.\n    See, over on my side of the bedroom is a mounted 32\" security monitor with 4 night vision cameras with IR spotlights in overlapping fields of view around our home, all feeding to a 1TB hard drive. It's a habit to look over at the monitor while watching TV or whatever and I noticed on camera #3 (the one facing the wild wyld wood about 50 yards from our house and the driveway) an extremely bright, arc welder bright, sphere of light about 4 ft across sitting motionless about 30' off the ground just outside the tree line. I wrinkled my brow in curiosity and raised my finger to point at it on the monitor and started to say \"Baby, what's tha-\" and the sphere winked out like a soap bubble and our cameras blinked.\n\n     Ooo, feel the pucker there? Yeah, me too.\n\nSo like sane people we ran around locked all the doors and windows, grabbed some guns and hid under the bed with the dogs.\n\n   But what kind of story would that be?\n\nNo, I put on my boots and grabbed a flashlight and my Ruger .40 with hollow points and headed out into the night.\n  \n  I came around the house to my gardens and walked out on the great stone slab where I had many containers and old bathtubs and drums cut in half longways full of dirt, waving my flashlight around. I wasn't sure what exactly I was looking for, but I knew I'd know it when I saw it, yah know?\n   First spot I shine the light on was the area we saw the sphere of course. Saw a pair of glowing eyes. \n\"Cat\" I said out loud and panned the beam further down the trees. Still seeing nothing, I swung the beam back to the only thing I did see, which was the cat. \"Cat\" I said again thoughtfully as I looked at it for lack of anything else to look at.  I was just about to head back in when the \"cat\" stood upright about 3 ft tall and opened a second set of eyes right under the first.\n\nSuper pucker\n\n So, I dropped everything and ran in the house and locked the doors and windows, grabbed the guns and hid under the bed.\n\nBut what kind of story would that be?\n\nI learned that night what I'm about and how I react to the beyond when it's staring at me. And apparently my reaction is to call out in a loud and cheerful voice, \"Hi! You don't have to be afraid. I won't hurt you. Please don't hurt me? You can come here into the gardens to meet, but you are not invited inside!\"\nThe eyes surged forward as soon as I was done speaking. It was coming right at me.\n\nSo I dropped everything and ran in the house, locked the windows and doors, grabbed the guns and hid under the bed like a sane man, right?\n\nBut what kind of story would that be?\n\nNo, I held firm. I had every stress emotion my brain could produce suddenly on stage as whatever it was sped through the long grass toward me. I kept telling myself that no matter what resolved itself into the beam of my light I needed to keep my hand off my pistol, and just accept whatever event was about to happen in a nonviolent manner.  Closer the form came, strangely morphing and shifting until what was revealed was....2 cats that had apparently been standing on a stump and came when I called out because foodgiver, and one great giant jackass swinging a flashlight\n\nSo a bit chagrined, I headed in to see what babydoll had CSI'd out of the video. And that's where it got really unsettling.\n\nShe tried to back it up to round the time the sphere was seen by starting from when she can see my flashlight beam bobbing about on the trees but she kept running into a blank spot. Starting the video from the time you can see my headlights and letting it run forward also ran into a blank spot. We determined by the timestamps that there was about 11 seconds unaccounted for. At first she thought it might have been an artifact of trying to pause and backup the footage. But then we played it through for a 5th time starting from the headlights, and the video played smoothly without a glitch all the way to my bobbing flashlight. \n\nNo light. No blank spot. Just smoothly edited footage. Why would I say edited? Because, if we saw a drone, a reflected bug, a weirdo in a tree with a spot light, a plane with a light at the right angle, swamp gas, Venus, a flock of geese, whatever, we would have seen it on the playback. This left us with no clue and no leads and a growing doubt that we had really seen anything at all. Until the next day that is.\n\n  It was about mid-afternoon the next day and I had flagged down the landlords handman to chat and make plans for maybe doing a scrap haul later. The conversation worked it's way around and I said \"Hey, you wanna hear something odd?\" and told my tale. He halted me halfway through and asked \"You saw it too then?\"\n    I guess ol' boy had sent it through the cameras at the back family's trailer when he was making a few minor plumbing repairs that evening. He said they had seen it sitting in that same spot for the past 5 nights all night and had thought that we had installed a spot light. On state land. 30' in the air.\n\n So with this final revelation coupled with our experience, we laid out a pretty eerie reality; there was something there. It was watching me and the wife specifically, as the moment I noticed it, it poofed away, but didn't care about the folks 75 yards on. It was able to tell from 50 yards away at night through a wall what I was saying and where my attention was at. It was able to edit a non remote hardwired cameras system on the fly as easily as rolling a coat of paint. And since it did not finish the editing until after I was inside, it was definitely watching me outside alone.\n\nWhen I told the tale several folks told me that my story matched many tales of a similar type, and many of them were paired with a strange cat encounter immediately after the events.

        "text": "I had an experience years ago that really freaked me out. I‚Äôve always been skeptical of ghosts and similar phenomena and I‚Äôm not religious, but this is one of the oddest things I‚Äôve ever experienced. Years ago, probably around 2014, I was visiting family in Colorado. That side of my family is into the paranormal, especially ghosts. Something we do when we meet up is use a ‚Äúghost box‚Äù, which I‚Äôm sure many of you are familiar with. For those who aren‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a radio that scans across channels very quickly and supposedly picks up the voices of spirits. Not the most technical definition, but just to cover the basics. Anyways, we decided to use it one night but didn‚Äôt have anything interesting happen. So, we instead decided to swap ghost stories in the backyard, which I always enjoy. Well, about half an hour into our discussion my brother starts feeling nauseous. He‚Äôs saying weird things and acting possessed, which I thought was a cheesy (and not very funny) joke. He‚Äôs pretty funny usually, so I knew something was wrong when the ‚Äújoke‚Äù was going on for too long. Besides, our interests in the paranormal are typically limited to ghost stories, tarot readings, and energy. Needless to say, this was not in our wheelhouse of typical or expected outcomes. My aunt decided to cleanse the area with some sage but he was saying it smelled like burning bodies, which isn‚Äôt the most comforting thing to hear. Some time goes by and he feels more normal, but still nauseous. At this moment, suddenly, there was a blue ball of light (maybe a foot or less in diameter) across the yard and past their fence, into their alleyway. I saw the light lower slowly towards the ground, shrinking as it descended. Descended seems to be the proper word, as it didn‚Äôt seem to be falling as it was much too slow. The ball of light got smaller and smaller until it touched the ground, remained stationary for a few seconds, then went out. There was no noise and it seemed to just ‚Äúpop‚Äù up out of nowhere. Nobody said a word until it was over, which is when we started freaking out all over again. We searched the next morning for anything that could have caused the light but there was nothing. We have a few brain cells between the few of us and ruled out flashlights, flares, reflections, etc. My aunt and cousin claim to be more ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù to energy, and stated that it was quite intense during the experience. \n\nAny thoughts on what this could have been? Please feel free to share below! We still have no idea what happened that night, but have leaned towards the idea that we accidentally messed with something we shouldn‚Äôt have. I‚Äôm not sure about that, I just know it was strange.",

        "text": "I haven't spoken about these events to anyone since they've happened to me over a decade ago, honestly, closer to fifteen years. I am now a 30 year old man and what I experienced in Red Ash, Caryville Tennessee  happened to me when I was about 15 or 16 years old.\n\nRed Ash is a small area off interstate 75 running through Campbell County Tennessee, the county where I was born and raised and still reside in now. Red Ash was established over a hundred years ago as a little mining province, but is now defined as the land between Red Ash Cemetery and Red Ash Baptist Church off of old Tennessee Highway 63 and if you go googling it you'll see that it has a reputation of arguably being one of the most haunted places in Tennessee. \n\nFrom ghosts of miners, goatmen, and even murdered witches; if you read long and deep enough, you'll see there's lots of strange happenings around this area. But I am not here to tell you I saw a 7 foot tall man with the head of a goat and hooven feet standing at the base of a train track tussle. But what I saw I still to this day can't explain.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, a few friends and I, one guy who was a couple years older than myself and two lady friends of ours, were driving around one Saturday night looking to find something to get into in our small, quiet town. So naturally, of course, we came to the conclusion to do what all the teenage kids do that grow up in our county. We decided to go to Red Ash and test some of the legends and boy are their a lot of them.\n\nBut those are stories for a different page, this one isn't about urban legends. This is about what I actually saw. \n\nWe went to a set of train tracks that if you park on and turn your vehicle off that, somehow, the car will start to rock and gently roll off the tracks. That didn't work for us.  So we decided to head up the road to the cemetery to tell ghost stories. On the ride to the cemetery, one of the girls with us said her grandpa had told her on one of the unnamed dirt roads in Red Ash is an old, abandoned graveyard where a lady was murdered and buried almost two hundred years ago for supposedly being a witch. \n\nWe thought what the hell and decided to go looking for this graveyard to see if we could find the unmarked grave. We turn down one dirt road barely wife enough for my friends small car and drive down it for a few minutes when all of a sudden we're hit with blue lights behind us. \n\nAnd when I say all of a sudden, I mean it. Now, mind you it was around midnight and pretty dark out but we didn't see headlights or anything trailing behind us. Just the burst of blue police lights. My friend pulls off the road as much as possible and the cop pulls behind us and gets out of his cruiser and walks to the door. My friend already has his window down. It's late July and 80 degrees at night with no AC in his car, and he is waiting to be asked for his license and registration. The cop doesn't ask for it though. He walks up and looks through the rolled down window at my friend and says, \"You guys shouldn't be here, it's dangerous and a bad place. Please leave.\"\n\nNow I'm not sure about you guys, but hearing a guy say shouldn't and please isn't normal. Usually we here can't and now. But that's what he said and it through my friend off and he kind of stammered for words before the cop repeated himself, \"Please tell me you'll turn around, you shouldn't be here. It's dangerous.\" This time though my friend said yes sir and the cop just turned around and walked back to his car, turned off his lights and drove around us, continuing on thr road. That's when I noticed he wasn't driving one of the Tahoes or Chargers they typically drove, but a crown vic and an OLD crown vic. An early 80s square body Crown Victoria car. It was so bizarre. \n\nBut we didn't think much of it then, we just decided to head straight and follow him and turn around when he did. We followed him for a few seconds, up until he went up the hill on the dirt road and went around a curve, once we got up there passed the curve we noticed he was gone. Couldn't see any signs of his vehicle or anything. He wasn't pulled over off the road so we thought he might have been more familiar with the road and must have sped up to get to the end of it. So we followed the road for a couple more miles, no sign of the cop anywhere... until we got to the end of the road and it ended in a dead end. The cop was still no where. No signs of him passing us, pulling off the road (which was barely wide enough for him to pass us while we were pulled off it earlier) and there were no roads connecting to this old dirt road. \n\nSo many little weird things happened, and honestly, I still don't know what I saw or how to explain it. All I can say is that things are weird up there around Red Ash, and even now, I still listen to that cop... it's dangerous up there, and I stay away from it.",

Back in 2012 when me and my sister were kids, we played with the ouija board in our garage. Nothing ever happened, it never moved, nothing. Well after that weird things started happening that i just ignore. Sounds of footsteps in the house with no one there, someone banging on the front door at 3-4am with no one there, dogs barking at nothing, lights flickering. Well the most thing that keeps happening is our hallway in the house. Sometimes, the dogs we own will refuse to go down the hallway, its like they are seeing something. All four of them will stand there, stiff just staring and wagging there tail. I've taken pictures of the hallway, nothing out of the ordinary. This happens at night and day. 10 years later the dogs still do this. One of mine passed away in 2020 so i got a new one, he does the same thing, refuses to come down the hallway, i have to beg and walk with him slowly or he won't come. He will lay down or sit at the beginning of the hallway. What's weird is sometimes the light flickers here, but I honestly have no idea why the dogs do this. Also i forgot to mention that all the dogs at random times of the day will run down the hallway barking and growling ferociously. Any ideas? 10 years and this still happens!",

It‚Äôs only when I‚Äôm alone but not every time I‚Äôm alone and it seems to only happen in Texas. It‚Äôs weird but I never even considered that this was maybe something to be concerned about until recently. It was just something that happened. I even followed the voice once and only thought it was kind of weird that I had heard my dad screaming for me if he didn‚Äôt actually call me because I got home later and asked him about it.\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this is related or not but remembering it is what sparked this post. A few years ago I was about a mile out in the woods in Pennsylvania when I zoned out for a minute. When I zoned back in I heard a stick snap and looked over to see a white tail doe staring at me from about 10ish feet away. It looked almost as though it had been trying to sneak closer to me when I looked at it. I just sort of backed away from it and went back down the mountain.\n\nI‚Äôm not entirely sure what to make of this now that I‚Äôm looking back on all the times I just sort of brushed it off as normal.

Gives me enough time to eat, shower, and relax a bit before heading in. I also live on the third floor of a house. So naturally I know when someone (roommates) is coming up the steps. Putting my shoes on and about to head outside, I was telling them goodbye when suddenly I hear running coming up the steps. I can see nobody is there and y'all...lemme tell you that Ive never wanted to run more in my life. I had to take a minute because I was sure I was about to faint.",

Ever since I moved, everything's been going good and fine, especially because we left this other apartment which was filled with terrible dark and demonic energy. Now I'm starting to think that it's back and this energy found its way back to us. It's sad because it feels very much real, and is generally hard to avoid and get rid of. \n\nI've been trying to avoid a few people I've known from the past from coming over but couldn't, since they're not my people nor do I have any say in this. These are my mothers friends and I've been warning her and reminding her about how badly affected we will be again, based on past events and experiences. \n\nLately and recently I've been seeing black shadows, constantly moving around at random. I've been seeing doors in the house randomly opening and closing, and this has nothing to do with the wind. \n\nI've been constantly looking around as if there's someone in the house or someone near me, even though I'm completely alone, just me and my mother living here. \n\nI found a few things that I had to immediately throw away. A tooth while I was cleaning, and no this doesn't belong to anyone in the household, specially with its shape and size. Nobody else I know has a missing tooth either, I checked. Besides that, this tooth was never there to begin with ever since I moved in, since I've always been cleaning and re arranging the furniture anyway. \n\nMore and more cats appearing infront of me and my door way. They're not even as scared. They just sit there and watch me with no reaction, and it freaks me out. \n\nStrangers appearing infront of the door way and the apartment, constantly staring and running away hiding whenever they catch me finding them. \n\nPlates, cups, and other random items falling apart and breaking at random times even without them having ti slip, which again, I find very strange. The other day a ceramic player broke without it being moved or touched. A huge Crack and that's that. It's worse when things just started falling all over the house anyhow. Even with the pipes and the sewer department. The explosion of water and so on. Scares me too at how aggressive it gets. \n\nWell. I wish for an escape. Let me know.",

        "text": "This happened to me and my siblings when we were very young, but the memory is very vivid. This was the most intense paranormal experience I've had in my life and just wanted to get it out there. \n\nTo start, the house we lived in at the time was definitely haunted. My sister told me much later on that she would hear someone walking up the stairs and then a shadowy figure would stand in her doorway. I heard the steps back then, but I'd always assumed it was just her walking around. She didn't tell me until much later, as she didn't want to scare me. The house was very creepy at night. I always felt a profound sense of being watched whenever I would go past certain spots. It was completely different when I would go back home to mom's house, I wasn't afraid of the dark and I would still get up at night to go to the bathroom, but it always felt very scary to do so and I would hurry as fast as possible.\n\nOn to the actual story...\n\nI was 10, big sister 13, and little brother 8. I begged my older sister to let us play with a little ouija board keychain toy she had, because I was fascinated by ghosts and the supernatural. I wasn't scared of ghosts at all, in fact, I loved them a lot and only thought they were interesting. It took a lot of convincing, but eventually, she agreed to play with the board.\n\nWe all sat down at the kitchen table and my sister and I put our fingers on the planchette and asked if anyone was there, to which it almost immediately said \"yes.\" We spent some time arguing that the other was definitely moving it and just asking some benign questions I don't remember. After a bit, we started getting scared, so we said \"let's stop.\" The planchette Immediately and harshly moved to \"no,\" and we instantly pulled out hands back. As soon as we did, we all hear this horrible screeching or scream, one that did not sound human at all. We each describe it a bit differently, but we all heard it at once. We RAN so fast to the other room, where we all sat huddled on the couch for a long time. Finally, I asked if anyone else heard that, to which we all just nodded. \n\nWe stayed that way for hours, until my dad came home. We didn't tell him about it and nothing really came of it, but it was so terrifying that to this day, recalling it gives me chills.",

        "text": "I shared this in a comment to another post and figured since I typed it out I would share it directly here as well. It‚Äôs a long one so I put a TL:DR at the bottom. \n\n\nBack in college around 10 or so years ago, I was on campus late one night returning from break. Essentially there was a mess-up on my end with booking my flight a night earlier than the dorms opening and i didn‚Äôt have a place to sleep.\n\nAfter a train/bus ride to campus it‚Äôs around 9-10pm and so I‚Äôm coordinating with some buddies for a place I can spend the night at while the dorms are closed. It‚Äôs dark, campus is completely empty (but decently lit), and I‚Äôm just thinking of spots I could potentially crash at in the event nothing comes up.\n\nThe campus has a ton of seating areas like benches and couches, especially around the library so I decided to just go to one of the spots I know with a good vantage point but is still someone hidden so I don‚Äôt have to deal with any random people passing by. My bench of choice has my back against a building on a raised patio so I have a great view of anything within 100 or so yards in front me. Not a full 360 degree view but solid enough for me to feel comfortable with my surroundings.\n\nSo there I am texting my buddies joking around with them about the situation as we‚Äôre striking out with available options with only a few people we‚Äôre waiting to hear back from. I‚Äôm keeping an eye on my phone battery and fortunately we find one of our friends who‚Äôs staying at the dorms where international students live at and don‚Äôt close down for the break. Now we just gotta wait for her confirmation and so I breathe a sigh of relief and kick back and just enjoy the peacefulness of the quiet campus.\n\nMaybe around 10 or so mins go by when we hear back and she‚Äôs able to house me but won‚Äôt be free for maybe another hour or so. I decided to hang where I was and wait there as I didn‚Äôt want to be waiting outside her dorm with luggage.\n\nNow for the paranormal part.\n\nAs I‚Äôm sitting there, I look onto the library (which is a big cube shape) in front of me (like at my 11 o clock for reference of direction) and notice 3 lights around chest height steadily moving alongside the library wall. There‚Äôs campus security so I figured it was them with flashlights but considering it was late I kept staring to confirm. As they continued to move I noticed how unusually steady they were and that I couldn‚Äôt quite make out the shapes of the bodies they should‚Äôve have been attached to.\n\nI was about 40 yards away from them and my vantage point had me about 15 feet above the ground so I had a great view of anything that would turn the corner or move out into the open space between the buildings.\n\nThe library walls are windows and because of the design of the building there are pillars located 5 yards from the walls with about 7ish yards of spacing in between them.\n\nI share this because those orbs would disappear behind these pillars as they moved alongside the wall in my general direction (south) and did so 3 times before finally vanishing and not coming out the other side. They traveled around 20 yards and I freaked out because I was fully expecting and wanting to see a pair or trio of people.\n\nI immediately scanned the area trying to see if they may have turned back or moved anywhere else but nothing at all. I even got up and walked up to the edge of the rail in front of me to get a better look and nothing. I could see everything and there‚Äôs no way I would have missed them entering or leaving.\n\nAfter scanning for a bit more confused as to what I witnessed I immediately jump back on my phone to tell my buddies about what just happened and they say to just start heading over to our friends place. We text for about 2 more minutes when suddenly I felt an unsettling coldness around me and my phone dies on me despite it being at 60+ %.\n\nI say screw it, and grab my stuff and begin to head downstairs while on high alert to make sure I don‚Äôt miss anything around me. I have to walk by the library where the orbs were and I walk under other pillars  and was convinced that those orbs were definitely between the walls and the pillars as I would have seen anyone leave the area from where I was sitting.\n\nIt was a long walk to where my friend was and once my phone‚Äôs charged I see my buddies‚Äô message who freaked out when I didn‚Äôt respond after sharing the experience.\n\nPost event findings:\n\nNow what I experienced is questionable and so I wanted to do some digging into what on earth it could have been.\n\nAfter researching the university‚Äôs history, I learn of a triple murdered that occurred on campus in the 90s. A grad student (engineering) shot and killed 3 professors in the same department after not receiving the credit he wanted on his thesis and subsequent lack of employment.\n\nThe murders took place in one of the buildings nearby where I was at and considering the department they belonged to one could imagine them having strong ties to the library.\n\nAfter reading this I got goosebumps and believe it was that unfortunate trio I saw taking a ‚Äústroll‚Äù through campus.\n\nTLDR: I saw 3 orbs floating on campus moving between objects late at night with no one else around due to the holiday break. They disappeared after moving between pillars where I could see everything around in the area. Researched afterwards and learned 3 people professors were murdered by a student in a nearby building back in the 90s.",

In my dreams its home but I'm also very terrified in these dreams. \n\nI dont know how to explain it. \n\nIf anything its abandoned now. It's in Brandon MB Canada.  I dont know what to think of it. This house was very old and I recall experiencing things, like something unnatural was inhabiting the home. I even recall feeling tormented there, almost bullied like. I recall peeking around corners, being quite and alert within the home. I always felt uneasy. \n\nPrior to when we first moved therein 2005, we were told it used to be a party house. My mother told us before that there may be things that come with it from being a party house.. it's been nearly 10 years now and I just keep having these dreams where I'm back at home, but it's just me. It's a big 4 bedroom house and has alot of character to the building. \n\nI dont know what to make of it. I feel scared when I think about it. I feel theres a part of me that's hiding something in my memory that I've suppressed about the home.   \n\nHas this happened to anyone else? Is there something there that's not finished with me as to why it keeps bringing me back there in my dreams? I dont understand.",

I used to live in a small bungalow house with 2 bedrooms and during those times, my cousins are visiting. Our house is where some kids from the neighborhood hangs out.

        "text": "My mother and I were spending the weekend with my grandmother. We spent every other weekend with her, so I was very familiar with the area (I must have been 7 or 8 years old), and I eventually went on to live with my grandmother when my mother passed.\n\nOne night, I was in the guest bedroom playing Super Mario World on the Super Nintendo. The guest bedroom was very small with only one window. I was sitting in a little wooden chair that was made for me as a baby, and I still fit in it, so I would sometimes use it when sitting on the floor in front of the TV. I was very much into the game, when all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I heard what sounded like the loudest train horn I'd ever heard right outside the window. I was so startled that I knocked the chair backwards and ran out of the room screaming. I was scared enough to not dare go back into the room without my mother or grandmother with me.\n\nI have never been able to explain this. I have tried and tried. The reason I said I'm familiar with the area is because the closest train tracks are miles away. You could always hear train horns, but only faintly. This sounded like it was so close it was right in my ears, and it sounded like it was right outside the window, which I would've been sitting less than 10 feet from.\n\nI'm getting chills just thinking about it now, and I have no clue why. Since none of us have ever been able to come up with a reasonable explanation, I figured I'd turn here. I literally never thought to think that it might be a paranormal occurrence until just now. I'm usually a skeptic and have had multiple moments I life where I was certain that I had just had my first paranormal experience, only to later come to realize what had actually happened. But this is something that I have never been able to understand, it's just eerie to me. The best my grandmother and mother could come up with was that it was a freak occurrence where the wind had glanced with window in just the right way that it made such a sound. Possible I guess.\n\nNothing like it ever happened again. Though I should say that I always found that house to have a somewhat eerie quality. It wasn't that big of a house. Only one floor, and it was a condo, so it wasn't at all isolated or in the middle of nowhere either. There's a shopping center visible from the backyard. However, the layout of the house always slightly unnerving to me. Somewhat small rooms clustered very close together and a very small hallway with the remaining rooms connected directly to it. The hallway was always dark as there were no windows in it. I always had weird dreams about the house years later. Dreams that I was coming into the house late at night with all the lights off and the door being wide open. And other weird and creepy dreams. But literally nothing bad ever happened to me or to us in that house. But all my dreams about it were usually creepy in nature. And I was always especially unnerved by that bedroom in which I heard the loud sound. Even years later when that became my bedroom and I was in it every night. Something was always weird about it. However, I never felt like I was \"feeling a presence\" or anything like that. It was always so inexplicable.\n\nAnyways, just thought I'd drop this here to see if anyone would have a logical, non-paranormal‚Äîor possibly a paranormal‚Äîexplanation for the train horn thing. I'm sure there's also some sort of explanation for why I was always slightly weirded out by the house, but I just can't put my finger on it.",

        "text": "I'm normally a very logical person when it comes to these things and I investigate everything before declaring it to be paranormal but, something unusual is going on and maybe need other opinions about the situation. Every single night my bedroom door handme is shaking and it's sometimes violently shaking as if someone trying to break in or other times shaking 2 or 3 times loud enough to wake me from a deep sleep. As a result I have a door security bar under the door handle in case it's a possible break in happening. What's irritating about it is it happening every single night but also happens 5am - 7am. Before it happens around 3am sometimes 3:30am I hear a loud boom noise as if someone broke into the house but see no one when this happens and no sign of a break in. I've found no entry clues or anything and have a ringdoorbell on the front door. There is a back door but it's always locked and you'd have to enter the garage to get inside. \n\nThis is a brand new home built 4 years ago as well, everything inside is new and one wall which is in the kitchen/livingroom area is shared with the neighbors who havnt been so nice since I moved here. These are very angry people next door who bang on walls, let's their bulldogs bark for several hours, and who I feel have been the ones waking me up 3am and 3:30am every night. Sometimes waking me up 2am with the boom noises. I really don't feel it's a spirit or ghost since the home is brand new. I just bought this house and living here about 5 months now.\n\nThis home doesn't have natural gas so no gas leak, no unusual chemical smells, there is a higher EMF radiation level though at 12 6ft or higher and when laying down at 4ft above the floor on my bed. I have a shungite crystal that absorbs radiation as well in my home I recently bought thinking maybe it's radiation. I havnt found anything indicating previous tenants were using magick or anything but found number 3 and 9 written on 2 different door frames on the side with a grey pencil but if won't come off. \n\nNothing else unusual at all about the home had a full home inspection including the attic. So, my theory is it might be a neighbor coming into my home from the garage having an additional clicker and key since I still havnt changed locks yet but, it's generally a very safe area. I think someone is trying to persuade me to think the home is haunted to move out. Someone is opening the outside panel to the garage like the cover to it where you put in the code so, I'm finding that. I have no evidence to support this is a neighbor.\n\nI put a jar of salt and cinnamon outside the door the absorb negative energy in case its a spirit but nothing happening to stop the door handle to my debrook from violently shaking waking me up. I'm thinking it has to be the neighbor that doesn't like me next door. At the same time I am thinking what is the neighbors are evil or something. I really don't know what to think at this point.",

        "text": "i feel creeped out even typing this. i‚Äôm staying at my friends house in tennessee over winter break, and tonight i helped her feed the neighbors dogs because they were out of town. her house is in a somewhat rural area, there‚Äôs clusters of homes kind of spread across fields, forest, and lake areas. all very beautiful and lots of wildlife. \n\nanyways, it‚Äôs about 9 pm and its way past sunset, it‚Äôs quite dark, and we‚Äôre walking the short distance from the neighbors house back to hers. we‚Äôre on a road but directly next to us is a small woods sloping down into the lake. i am a little nervous about it so i make a joke like ‚Äúthat forest is kinda creeping me out, imagine if there‚Äôs a sk*nw*lker in there‚Äù (my friend said it‚Äôs bad luck to type it out/say it aloud, i didn‚Äôt know that til after this event and i‚Äôm not taking chances lol). she laughs and gobbles like a turkey loudly into the forest. i jokingly say like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôll attract one‚Äù and not even 5 seconds later we hear an identical gobble back to us from the forest. it was definitely not an echo and there were no light in there, no paths, and it was very cold, like 30 degrees, can‚Äôt imagine anyone would be there. \n\ni just remember saying ‚Äúoh my god‚Äù then sprinting as fast as i could back to the house. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever ran so fast or meaningfully. i didn‚Äôt turn back and was so out of breath. my friend thought the whole thing was funny but it was so freaky! does anyone know what this was? maybe it was just a turkey or someone trying to be funny?",

I pray for them to get better; I'm never afraid of what I'm experiencing. Last night, I finally had a dream of a little girl that was possessed. In this particular dream, I couldn't get close to her for some reason. I‚Äôm wondering why do I keep having these dreams? Is there something happening in my life that I'm not aware of?",

        "text": "I woke up last night from a nightmare and my dream catcher was swinging and twirling around quite a lot. I also heard a really high pitched sound. I have no idea what the sound was as I have never heard it before. \nI tried to convince myself that it was the wind making sounds as it came through my top window (I assumed it was open and that‚Äôs why my dream catcher kept moving). I couldn‚Äôt see if my window was open or not because my blinds were drawn.\nI woke up this morning and the wind was way stronger then last night BUT the sound had gone. I went to check if my window was open but it was closed.\n\nDoes anyone know what happened last night? The dream catcher was moving so much, not like a gentle breeze was causing it to move. And the high pitch sound that sounded kind of electronic? If anyone knows what it could be, let me know please haha",

I hear the a door close and the door‚Äôs back in its place and I hear laughing, I aimed my gun at where the laughing was coming from and see the silhouette of a man in the doorway to my room, and I yell at him to get on the ground, and he just turns to dust, so I‚Äôve now locked myself in the bathroom, and I‚Äôve heard my name being called, the bathroom door and window are being slammed on whenever I‚Äôm not recording, and I‚Äôm having a mental breakdown, just sitting in the bathroom with my gun in my hands.",

        "text": "So I work in a restaurant in Wyoming that was where the towns original train station was located back in 1894, the original building was moved across the street and they replaced the train station with a bigger building in 1912 which is the building that I work in now. I‚Äôve been getting weird feelings since I started working there, I know the building has a lot of history and I feel the presence of different entities there for sure. I was scared out of there a few weeks back just from the heavy overwhelming presence that seems to get worse when it‚Äôs late and you‚Äôre alone. But tonight‚Ä¶.\n\nI was locking up the building, I went to lock the event storage space but realized one of the cooks left his bike in there so I went to grab him to pull his bike out so I could lock. He went in, grabbed his bike, and walked out leaving me alone in this room. I shut the door behind him and locked it, I walked through the room to the other side to turn the light off before walking through a swinging door that leads to the event dining area. As I turn the light off I hear a raspy, disgruntled voice, loudly and clearly say ‚ÄúMommy, Daddy‚Äù from the other side of the room. I‚Äôm not kidding you I ran so fast out of that room through the building I felt like I teleported. I found the cook and he walked through to see if anyone was in there and there was no one. It was just us two and one more server that was in the other side of the building rolling silverware. It was a very evil sounding voice, defiantly not a child. I should not have ran like a terrified child because now I feel like it‚Äôs going to just try to scare me more next time. It felt like it was intentionally waiting for me to be alone and for me to turn the lights off. Y‚Äôall I‚Äôm ready to quit because I‚Äôm sensitive to entities and can feel them, this just feels evil.",
