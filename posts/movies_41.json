I still prefer the more serious with bits of dark comedy in the first 3 movies, but this one has a different flavor that doesn't hurt for this franchise.\n\nI definitely appreciate that Chucky still remains serious as he started in Child's Play 1.\n\nI appreciate that this movie still takes itself seriously, while with goofy vibes, and I dig that this movie has a good amount of fun with the fact that Chucky and Tiff are both psychos that just so happen to be dolls. \n\nHowever.....Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile do not give very good performances in this imo, in competition for the worst of the franchise. They just ham it up way too much even for the tone of this movie.",

        "text": "Just wanted to share what I watch week by week and see what other people think. \n\n26/02\nAntman and the Wasp: Quantumania - I didn't like the film much. Thought there was too much of a tonal inconsistency, and most of the characters were very flat or existed just for a gag. Johnathan Majors was great as Kang and the sequence with Scott with his variants getting the core was great though. It's probably my least favorite out of Antman Trilogy.\n\nWe Have a Ghost - It's a decent family flick. It's a bit too long, and the first act is pretty hard to get through, but the rest of the film is pretty decent. It has a tonal issue, especially once it gets to the third act, but it's pretty enjoyable, and David Harbour is great as always. \n\n27/02\nBrendan Fraser's The Mummy (Rewatch) - It's a classic, not much to say, that already hasn't been said.\n\n28/02\nRed Notice - This was really bad. It's completely devoid of humor and life. It's a soulless big budget action movie. Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson don't have great chemistry, and neither has a funny line once. On top of that, the movie still ends up with Dwayne in a jungle. \n\n01/03\nBatman Ninja - It was alright. For around 40 minutes, it was pretty great. It's incredibly stylish while not losing the charm of Batman. It's towards the third act that it completely goes off the rails and becomes a tropey anime fest with palaces that are mechs, which can combine, and a combination of monkeys and bats forming a huge Batman. It jumps the shark to say the least.\n\n02/03\nMoonfall - It's probably the dumbest movie I've ever seen. It's the usual Roland Emmerich flick with destruction everywhere. The only difference is that it takes every single conspiracy theory about the moon, accepts it as fact, and rolls with it. The movie is taking itself so seriously that it's amusing. Probably the best bad movie released last year.\n\nKnock at the cabin - I wish there was more to the story but for what it was it was decent. Absolutely loved Dave Bautista in this, he was awesome. The ending was fairly predictable and pretty weak. Although I personally liked that the kills were mostly done off-screen so it doesn't take away from the overall tension. Also really liked the relationship between Eric, Andrew, and Wen.\n\n\n03/03\nThe Bad Guys - It was fine. I loved the animation and the physical humor. The story was alright but I didn't like the twist villain. It felt incredibly predictable and unnecessary. The movie could have just been a decent character piece about wanting to be a better person instead of having a world-domination scheme thrown in.\n\n04/03\nUncharted - Dull and boring. I don't hate Tom Holland's and Mark Wahlberg's casting as Nathan Drake and Sully, but I do hate how boring this film is. It really needed some sort of horror element or perhaps better villains to liven it up. The action sequences were mostly underwhelming and the characters were kinda flat for me. I liked the relationship between Sully and Nathan but it doesn't save the movie from being painfully generic.",

Bright colours like the original Star Trek? Would you keep the 8bit sound tracks? Would you make them gritty and real? Do you think they have enough cultural cache to do anything with?",

I've seen both films and I'm just absolutely shocked that they chose the latter over the former for the Oscar. \n\nIt really got me thinking about what movies other people on the subreddit thought got snubbed in the animation category so I wanted to make this post to see what others had to say and maybe find some new animated films I need to watch.",

His career has proved that the hype was real.\n\nOn the other side we have M. Night Shyamalan. The dude was touted as the next Spielberg. We now know how that turned out.\n\nSo, what directors lived up to their initial hype?",

        "text": "In the last few years, both TV and film have seen a ton of reboots (some say too many, but that's a different story) and a great deal of legacy characters have returned with them, to varying degrees of success.  I thought I'd talk about some of those here and which ones got it right or not:\n\n**Top Gun: Maverick**  Clearly one of the most successful examples, given how well received, critically and commercially this movie has been.  Maverick is older but we see he can beat pilots half his age, showing what an exceptional pilot he is.  The death of his buddy Goose has clearly sobered him as a pilot and he's learned to look out for his wingmates.\n\n**The Star Wars Sequels**  This seems to be on the other end of the spectrum.  I didn't hear much that was positive from fans as to how they handled characters coming back, especially Luke in \"The Last Jedi\", where he's cynical, sulky, and seems to get more wisdom than he imparts.  Maybe they were trying to do something different with him here, but I don't think it works.\n\n**Ghostbusters: Afterlife**  I don't think legacy characters necessarily need to be the lead characters, even if they were originally.  But the arrival of the three surviving original Ghostbusters at the end works well, and Egon's ghost manages to stay on the line of sentmental and not in bad taste.\n\n**Creed Films**  As above, Rocky Balboa is no longer the lead, but drops to the number two spot, but works great as a mentor and father figure to a younger fighter.\n\n**Jurassic World Films**  It was nice to see Grant, Ellie, and Malcolm again (that courtroom scene in the second film didn't really count), and they had some chemistry, but not as exciting as any of the above.  Actually the most compelling character in the last film was Dr. Wu, who, after being morally questionable for a couple of films, is genuinely determined to redeem himself.  Lewis Dodgson from the first movie also returned (played by a different actor, presumably because the original actor was involved in some bad stuff), without really any connection to the first film until a couple of callbacks at the very end. \n\n**Terminator films beyond the second one**  These just don't seem to work, even with Arnie or Linda Hamilton.  Maybe it's just that the second film offered such a definitive ending that anything else feels tacked on and unnecessary.\n\n**Spider-Man: No Way Home**  Another success story as the two previous Spideys have great chemistry with the current one.  It's gratifying them getting opportunities to correct past mistakes (especially Andrew Garfield) and the villains all worked great as well (though Lizard was a bit under-used and Sandman's motivations were a bit odd).  Overall, great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a few others, like Tron: Legacy, Backdraft 2, the newer Indiana Jones, etc.  Thoughts?",

Obviously he's too old to play a gunslinger, but I envisioned something where he played an old timer just trying to live out his final years only to be harassed by someone trying to take his land.   His son, played by Scott of course, shows up, maybe fresh out of the Civil War and wages war against the evil land baron and his hired guns.  \n\nCould have been sort of a passing of the torch from father to son, not that there's a chance that Scott will ever be the movie star his dad was.  Still, it would have been a cool way for Clint to end his career and a nice send off for his fans.",

        "text": "Just watched A House of Sand and Fog for the first time and thought it was very well done.  I am curious though why Jennifer Connelly's character Kathy never received any proceeds when the house was auctioned off to Ben Kingsley's character.  If they were auctioning it off to pay the back taxes that only totaled $500 then she should have received the remainder of the proceeds after the city/county was made whole.  Am I missing something here?  I know she wanted to keep the house more than she wanted the money, but at least she wouldn't have been stuck sleeping in her car if she had received the roughly $40,000 she was due after the auction.",

The best way I can describe it is that there are little snippets of scenes and hard cuts in the montages that they’re in. Is there a name for this type of editing style? I know I did a bad job explaining it, but if you’ve seen the film, you probably know what I mean.",
