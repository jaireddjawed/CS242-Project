I have done this, but I would advise using caution or avoiding this all together. People can become defensive and unpredictable when confronted about this type of thing.\n\n",

I'm thinking grabber for the small stuff, but sometimes a pick might be easiest. \n\nSince I would typically do this on hikes, are there any good lightweight telescopic ones ? \n\nEdit: Oh preferably available in Sweden, but if I know what type to look for I can maybe find it here.\n\nThanks!\n\nAlso what should I look for in my trash bags? At home I only use very small flimsy ones that are not suitable for this, I tried it once and they easily tear so that's not a solution. Do you just take the extra sturdy ones?\n\n\nSo far I usually did it with my bare hands (not so much dangerous stuff here anyway and I'm careful), but sometimes it gets annoying to crouch every other second.",
