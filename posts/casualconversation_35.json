I  pour about a teaspoon full of boiling water into his bowl and he laps it up like it's the best thing ever!\n\nJust giving him his wet food out of the fridge, he turns his nose up until it warms up to room temperature, but if I add the hot water, he's on it like he hasn't eaten in days.\n\nDo your animal companions eat their food in unexpected ways?

        "text": "19F here. About a month and a half ago, my bf(best friend) and friend went to a hockey game together. On the train back home, my bf seemed a bit off and since she was the first one to get off the train, I mentioned to my other friend. Anyway, our friend mentioned something about my bf getting a dating app which I didn’t know about, but I didn’t really care, many people use those apps now. And the only reason why she mentioned it was because she though I had known as well. The friend and I were thinking about telling my bf that I know about it but we figured that it wasn’t really that big of a deal so we kept it to ourselves. And honestly, I pretty much forgot about it.\n\nA few days ago, I get a call from that friend and she’s telling me that she told my bf and that she had a really bad reaction. I didn’t really know what to do, I wasn’t sure if my bf was going to approach me about it and I also wanted to give her time. \n\nToday, I text my bf, and she’s telling me to show her mine and my friends messages, and she asked if I could talk on the phone.\n\nWe get on a phone call, and I send her the messages, she’s pretty angry which I can truly understand. But at the same time, she was making it a way bigger drama than it actually was.. she was saying that we were talking behind her back, as if we had weekly conversations about her. (And just to clarify, that friend and I never have one-on-one meetups, we always meet when it’s the 3 of us). Anyway, the phone call was pretty much her telling me how disappointed she is in us and that she doesn’t know if she can forgive us. Again, I completely understand her perspective but am I the only one who think she’s overreacting? Like, she’s putting our friendships on the line bc her having a dating app got mentioned and we didn’t tell her…. I feel like that’s a bit too dramatic..\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Any ideas on what I could do?",

(When the data cap flips over to the new month, we may, and this is a \\*may\\*, get 2Mb/s down.) And even less up.\n\n It hardly works, it doesn't give the advertised speed (25Mb/s Down, and 10Mb/s-5Mb/s Up, I think.) can't play multiplayer games, can't stream YouTube videos hardly. Hardly can load Reddit sometimes. \n\nIf it rains, minds well do something else. Want to download a picture, it's only 1Mb? Oh, well, I see. That'll take 14-30 minuets. Almost done? Oops I'll just disconnect because a cloud showed up. Want to learn a programing language, as is my case? Nah, you'll be learning it and then the next hour you won't be able to load the page and your flow state is completely shattered. Bought this game on Steam/EpicGames/Xbox digitately? Might get to play it within 4 days from now if you keep the Xbox on over night. \n\nThis is what I have been dealing with for years... Unstable internet that is ripping us off. However, after years dreaming of the day I can load a website anytime of the day, download anything without a data cap of 50Gb's, etc. Fiber Optics is finally coming to our area! And I am super excited! There is a 1Gb/s plan, 700Mb/s plan, and 350Mb/s plan which is what we are getting only for $49.99 a month. No data caps, no contracts, nothing of the sort.\n\nFinally internet can be a tool that we have, instead of a luxury item we have to pay this price for because they can get away with it as they don't really have any competitors in this area. \n\n350Mb/s can stream anything, download something without worrying about destroying out data cap for the month and effecting the process of using the internet for the other people who are connected here as well.",

I feel like if any of my real friends discovered my Reddit account they'd be really surprised at how I act on here. Is anyone here the same or do you act similar IRL to how you act on social media?",

        "text": "Or anything in-between if you want, but ps and xbox are the big 2. So as per the long debated topic. Which is better? Frankly, with the latest ps things I've no clue anymore. Ps5 is super underwhelming, can't run ps3 games, sony merged ps+ and ps now. Streaming games is dogshit, and they won't develop an emulator for it. I just wanna play some good childhood games like infamous 1 and 2, rygar the kegendary adventure (which was actually ps2, but its not even available on this game in ps+ premium), fallout nv and 3, etc. But i can't because of all these issues. Frankly I'm considering buying an xbox, maybe xbox has all the games i want. That being said, ps has benefits. Some real good exclusives are on there, some of my best memories are on ps. And xbox has a large margin of exclusives i don't care for. Ex: forza, or any sport game fir that matter. I hate sports and sport games. That being said, game pass is better than ps+ by a long shot. And has better games available on it. \n\nAt this point I'm pretty confused which to like better. Ps has issues with ps5 being too expensive, ps5 has terrible storage, sony has made some bad choices for ps, etc. But has good games. Xbox has mostly little kids, less quantity of favorable exclusives imo, is much bigger and chunkier, etc. But really did some things well.\n\nI'm curious what you guys think? Whats your reasoning? Should i get a xbox?",

He just says he's \"in a new rental while his car's at the shop\". I was like \"Ok? So what kind of car tho?\". He says a new Chrysler Van. \n\nSo as I pull in, I scan the parking lot and there's one Chrysler Van parked. It's running, but it has no license plate and no temporary license plate in the rear window. Which, by itself, is not that sketchy. But. Rentals ALWAYS have license plates. But as that thought crossed my mind, I still didn't think too much of it. \n\nThen I noticed another car (different make/model), parked right next to the van.  This car is also running and also has no license plate and no temp plate in the window. \n\nSo my Spidey sense goes off and I bailed out.

And the community center where I worked, hosted a break dancing club/crew, that was started by ex gang members, who wanted to promote healthier things for youth to get involved with than violence. \n\nFast forward to about ten years ago, they made a documentary, opened up their own break dance academy, travel the world sharing their story. While I saw these guys every day, and served them meals, I wasn’t really involved at all with the breakdance ministry, they really did that ok their own. But I still am proud of them, and how they continue to serve the youth in their community. But is it weird to feel so invested in them and proud of them, despite not directly bring apart of their group? Anyway idk.\n\nRecently the topic of break dancing came up, in conversation, and I remembered those guys, and was curious where they are now. I found their Instagram account, and saw a recent post from last fall, that one of the kids I knew was killed in gang violence. It jolted me more than expected, I knew there was violence there, I’m sure there’s been others killed that I knew, but just have never heard about. But still, I feel grief over this guy. Even months later, and years since I’ve been in contact with him. \n\nIt’s also weird to realize the full reality of the violence and struggles of this place I love, and loved, and was my home for a short time. And the fact that I still can’t even realize the totality of it, is one of privilege and because I always was an outsider, and not truly living in it.",

My son just ROLLED with it.  He didn't let it phase him. He would circle back and offer to let her join in whatever he was doing or ask if there was anything she wanted to do, and when she would turn her nose up at it, he would just go off and do his own thing.  He was cheerful as could be and wasn't rude back, but didn't let her walk over him with either. He was just so mature about it.  \n\nLater in the evening, her mom pulled her aside and I assume had a conversation about it, because she was much friendlier afterward.  And they ended up having a good time together, no grudges. \n\nAnyway, it's not much, but I'm so proud of how he handled himself. And just how patient he was.  And I honestly believe his little friend left having learned from him how to be better person.\n\nAnyone else have little moments being impressed by the maturity of a little one?",

It gets lonely very often seeing others on social media having fun in clubs and other things while i sit in my room sitting numb on my chair and doing nothing. I thought at some point it’s ok but rlly i don’t want to lie to myself just to feel good. I have to embrace the loneliness. The gym is a good escape for me where i don’t think any of this but that for 2 hours a day. I will try to develop some skill or rediscover some old passions that i left behind. Deep inside me i know that my friends were bad for me and i couldn’t be myself 100% around them, but damn man i’m kinda lonely. I hope in time it gets better and i get to know different people that suit me better.",

I feel like I’m definitely a natural sciences girl. I am deeply passionate about marine biology, aquatic life, geology, botany and I feel like my interests in those fields are only growing. I am lucky enough to have a part-time job which is related to what I’m passionate about, but the job does not pay nearly enough to stay in it forever. I have also heard that most jobs related to natural sciences are not well-paid, unless you have advanced degrees. \n\nI realize that as I’m going to immerse myself into my corporate career I will not be able to continue working my part-time job. Or perhaps not even be able to maintain any sort of contact with the things I’m passionate about. What should I do in order to involve myself into those fields? I feel like switching my major and starting from scratch would be a terrible decision for me, as college is expensive here.",

I know it sounds a bit silly, as life is not black and white as I portrays, but I just wanted to talk about this matter and how some of you guys that are older would advise me to think about this now so I don't regret later?",
