Here are a few tips to help you wake up and make a great day:\n\nGet enough sleep: Make sure you are getting enough sleep each night to feel rested and energized in the morning. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\n\nSet a positive intention: Before getting out of bed, take a moment to set a positive intention for your day. This could be anything from \"I will approach challenges with a positive attitude\" to \"I will focus on being kind to myself and others today.\"\n\nDrink water: Drinking a glass of water first thing in the morning can help rehydrate your body and give you a boost of energy.\n\nMove your body: Even just a few minutes of stretching or light exercise in the morning can help wake up your body and mind.\n\nPlan your day: Take a few minutes to plan out your day and prioritize your tasks. This can help you stay organized and focused throughout the day.\n\nRemember, the key to making a great day is to approach each moment with a positive attitude and a willingness to be present and engaged in your experiences. With a little effort and intention, you can create a fulfilling and rewarding day, every day!",

I doubt you even listened.\n\nIf I tell you about a bad thing that happened to me, its because i need to tell someone about my thing and I trust you enough to come to you with it. I need to get it out, I need to talk about it. In this point in time Im not interested in hearing about your thing, I NEED you to LISTEN. Then once you have listened and ive got it all out and once you can tell Ive moved on, tell me about how you went through something similar.\n\nBy immediately going into your shit you are making it about you, try making the conversation about the other person and watch how much you help them.",

Keep electric outlets covered I stuck a penny into a slot when I was 3 and the hallway was on fire\n3. Never use the back of the stove for storage unless you take the knobs off\n4. Never store 9 volt batteries in anything with metal.  If you stick one in your pocket and it touches a penny or paper clip— you are going to the hospital \n5. Avoid charging an android phone near flammable stuff and don’t put in your pocket.  My boyfriend’s phone caught fire and he needed a cadaver donation for his butt cheek.

We like to both pre-heat our side of the bed before getting in, then to go to bed I turn mine off and she keeps hers on low. \n\nI will say one word of caution - if you’re trying to feel the wires with your hands through the sheets you can definitely feel them. But I haven’t once been annoyed by discomfort of wires on my body while I’m sleeping or falling asleep. We have a memory foam mattress so that might help.

Not my first operation but I have never figured out how to empty my bladder without this massive amount of discomfort of needing to pee. Especially when they pump your body full of saline. I really have to go Nr. 1 but those opiods just wont allow me. I have tried warm water, turning on the water crane, imagining a toilet right infront of me with closed eyes and what not. \nNothing seems to help and I dont want the Blue Mountain Stare Oil Change (Katheter).\n\nI think that could be a useful Tip for everyone who will need surgery in the future, because it is absolutely uncomfortable and can make life sooooooo much more easy.\n\nThx in advance.",

        "text": "You may not want to read this, but please share. I am not looking for anything other than support and love.\n\n[**The Past and the Present: A Two-Part Short Story Collection**](https://www.wattpad.com/story/323108648-the-past-and-the-present-a-two-part-short-story) **(chapter two for my story)**\n\nFor decades, people have debated the meaning of the word \"home.\" Some say it is simply physical, the bond you share between you and your house that you or your parents bought. Others say that it runs deep in the roots of humanity--somewhere someone can find comfort when needed, support in the darkest times. Somewhere where there is family. Now this brings us to the subject of family. Often when that word is mentioned, you think of your mother, father, siblings, grandparents... but have any of you thought about those who don't have a \"family\"? Children that have been disowned, abandoned, or have parents that have passed away, and now they have no friends and a horrible new foster or live in an orphanage? Hell, on the streets? Even children with toxic parents. They do not understand the meaning of family or home. I finally had a bitter taste of their experiences today. I just wanted to tell the world to be aware of these problems that occur in the deep reaches of society. My mother has been quite strange ever since, well, a long time ago. Irritable, hot-headed, irrational. Added the stress of having toxic friends at school and never really having a father figure in my life after my parents' divorce, it was too much for me. I knew that I'd never forgive myself for self-harm, so I resorted to something lighter, which I would later find to be much, much worse. I began to pull my hair, venting my anger on the dark, split strands. I had bald patches all over my scalp, ugly and horrid to the sight. Along with the acne I had sprouting on my forehead, which I often picked at when I was lonely or bored, I was a disgusting sight (this was further confirmed by one of my classmates and my mother). I cried myself to sleep almost every day, and my mom would always kick me out of the house with quite the temper. I had to walk myself to school one morning, an hour on foot away, almost. I had to wander the streets in search of something, anything, to ease the pain. Someone to talk to, I realized, alone out in the dark, dangerous streets of my town, flinching at every sound, wary of every car that passed our alley and stopped. It was easier said than done, I suppose. I worry that if I told the truest friend I had, then he would tell his father (good friends with my mother), who would tell my mother, which would get me in worse trouble. I feared her, the monster that had taken hold of my being. Whenever I brought this up, she would begin with the guilt trips, thousands of them piling at my feet, sealing me in a bubble filled with acidic air, away from the rest of the world. I got kicked out at least twice every week, with a black toe, a fractured finger, and a wounded pride and heart as the result. I thought I had finally been enlightened when I broke away from my friends (see the second chapter of \"The Past and the Present\" for details), finally free from torture, but oh how wrong I was. Tonight, I am in Taipei, with no resources, no money, and no way to get home to California, wandering the streets with three heavy suitcases, looking for someone that looked kind enough to give me even five NTD, around a couple cents USD. I had been at the Gongguan Night Market with my touchy mother when this happened. She saw one of the bigger, older bald patches that she had already probably thrown ten fits about, saying that it had gotten \"bigger, worse, balder\" which technically wasn't possible since it had those little inch-long hairs still steadily and evenly growing. Something that I've seen from my mother is that she jumps to conclusions very quickly. I HAD been pulling my hair, but just not there! I mean, I know that it's wrong, but, personally, I need someone to talk to, not her and her devilish self! It had seemed to matter where I pulled my hair (\"I told you to not pull that place!\"), then I was forced to admit that I did pull it elsewhere, then my mom was like: \"It doesn't matter if you didn't!\" \"...pull it there! Because, with my own two eyes, I see that it has gotten bigger than the last time!\" Well, I swear that I haven't been pulling that place, and she doesn't have solid proof: just the clues with the piles of hair by the bed and the time I spend alone in the bathroom. So, with 3600 NTD (120 USD), she asked me to go get a job and buy a ticket to go back to the US. For the record, I'm thirteen. Also for the record, nothing is that cheap anymore. She wouldn't even let me use MY phone to call the police! Not even the police! What am I going to do with this situation? I don't really know. I never curse, and here I am, saying all of the words in the light, or rather darkness, of the circumstance. I will never unpack my bags. I hope that you have gotten some type of message from my rambling. This experience shocked me at the cruelty of the world, and now I am always on my toes, not knowing when she is going to strike next, and how. I just wish that I had more time to prepare for this, scratch that, to prepare for life when I was in the \\]womb... I don't know. That's the summary of my life. Torn between two, never been able to punch her when she slaps me, kick her when she seizes me to pull me outside and hurt me... I want to rebel, but I can't. I'm scared that she'll find me someday. Share this with your friends. Make the world know the horrors of life. I hope that I will save people, unlike the mentor that I never had. I hope that you will succeed, unlike me.\n\nSave me.",

        "text": "Hello people,\n\nI know nobody will read this but.. i will give it a try\n\nafter I just had a spontaneous nervous breakdown (which I had ned for years) I need and want to change something urgently. Unfortunately, I come with known again and again to the point that I can not change anything big.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all to me, as I had already written in another post a few points about me.\n\nI have lost everything over the last years,\n\nJust under 34 years\n\n2 children with 2 women, divorced, separated.\n\nHave lost my job due to burnout and herniated discs and a GDB and equality(like a 50% diability), am physically limited.\n\nBecause of this, I have been in therapy for years (and still am), but these are only of limited help, because they do not change anything in my life.\n\nThen I started retraining (in which I am currently).\n\nI had to fight for this retraining in court, because it was rejected for no reason, although I had an equalization, that even an expert opinion had to be created, which threw me back years and made me financially absolutely broken. (Insolvency)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy current remaining property by all circumstances amounts to perhaps 2000-3000 € furniture clothes equipment, etc..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt comes to the fact that I am completely on my own, since my grandparents are already deceased, a few years ago my father, almost all my uncles and aunts and I have no real contact with my mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother has been receiving Hartz 4 for almost 20 years and unfortunately is 0 interested in my life, and since Corona contact has completely fallen by the wayside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMY current problem is simply my financial situation, everything you apply for takes months for no reason but if someone wants money this is immediately arranged.\n\na pair of examples:\n\nI get travel expenses reimbursed by the pension fund (which is virtually my employer through the rehabilitation retraining).\n\nThis has lasted 7 months until an automated payment was initiated regarding Abokarte ÖPNV,\n\nMeanwhile, however, or was a sick note internally 4 weeks later after submission processed whereby I had days absent in the system, which was immediately billed to me and me almost 200 € were deducted.\n\nThrough which I had, among other things, a chargeback of travel costs and extra fees (for which, of course, no one wants to pay).\n\nSuch things happen to me unfortunately constantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I had made a housing subsidy application in addition which now lasts but 4 months and I can count on it in April at the earliest, besides, the sum is much lower than I was previously assured and it brings in principle nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I want to do something and must I have asked the pension fund how it looks with a side job, because they would have to allow it.\n\nThese say however I may not make physical Nebenjobs (which unfortunately nearly all are) and besides perhaps 5-10h the week, since the retraining might not be endangered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen comes the point that had made me mentally really broken, I am in this whole situation ONLY because it was too much for my ex-partner with all these fate burdens, which is why she wanted to separate,\n\nA couple therapy and co. she had currently always vehemently rejected, because she also had some construction sites or has.\n\nWe parted on good terms and have always understood each other well and I did not want to burden her with my life even more, and I got along with it for a while. or has not kept me busy, because I wanted to sort out my life first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about 1.5 terrible years under really bad living conditions it went uphill again (Bzw. with the retraining) and my ex-partner had increasingly sought my proximity also because of our daughter.\n\nSince November we had decided to go to a couples therapy, because we wanted to work on communication etc. (Because there were always small unnecessary quarrels).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt all went well that I had even suggested to her that we could possibly just pull together again and be a real family.\n\nShe told me in January (I have not been seeing anyone for months and do not want a relationship in general).\n\nNow last week but only 2-3 weeks later she suddenly has a new partner and me Monatelang only as an emotional trash can used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat just broke me ... and I'm even more annoyed that it suddenly put such a strain on me ....\n\nWhat really annoys me, I can't even do anything about it, I tried to distract myself or even play the dating game and get to know others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's just that I kept becoming starkly aware that a lot of things don't fit into my life at all.\n\nA. many women actually have a problem with men having children (i.e. women who don't have children themselves).\n\nB. Women who have children are often so much time + their own responsibilities (handling, etc.) that you can almost no longer be spontaneous or generally meet with someone.\n\nYou would almost always have to decide to move in with someone directly. (Which is absolutely the wrong way)\n\nIn addition, my overall situation is also not really the best with which I also want to burden no one really and or I'm not looking for someone as a \"stopgap\" for something, just because I can not have what I actually wanted to have, \"Only a perfect family\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just find it very unfortunate that 2x was decided to put a child with me in the world, but then did not want to be pulled together and you are then just left standing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just mentally so broken, which always affects my body and I have for weeks now or a tonsillitis and irritable cough (No Corona).\n\nBeen to the doctor several times ... tried everything possible and can't get rid of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have also started in my spare time to become more active again or by playing evenings only that is also not nice when I'm health stricken.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy question finally, WHAT can I change in my life especially financially ... that I can simply breathe again ... I feel for years so just like a prisoner, because I am absolutely limited in my actions ...\n\ntanks for your time 😞",
