Near them, on the sand,\n\n&gt; Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\n\n&gt; And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\n\n&gt; Tell that its sculptor well those passions read\n\n&gt; Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\n\n&gt; **The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:**\n\n&gt; And on the pedestal these words appear:\n\n&gt; ‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\n\n&gt; Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'\n\n&gt; Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\n\n&gt; Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\n\n&gt; The lone and level sands stretch far away.”\n\ni love this sonnet but i've never been able to make much sense of *the hand that mocked them* or *the heart that fed.*\n\nthe absence of a verb leads me to think that these items are in apposition to something previously mentioned ... either the *passions* of the erstwhile pharaoh that the sculptor artfully captured or the *lifeless things*, which is more enigmatic to me.\n\nthe *passions* are the frown, lip, and sneer mentioned above (also the demonstrative *those* as opposed to *these* leads me to believe that it's referring to something above, not below), so let's rule that out.\n\nso the *hand that mocked them* and *the heart that fed* are, i guess, the lifeless things--the lifeless body parts of the colossus? but here is where i cannot follow. egyptian statues have hands, sure, but not hearts (they are not anatomical models).\n\nand what does it mean for a heart to *feed*? on what? worship?\n\nand the big question is: *whom* is the hand mocking?--what is the pronoun *them* referring to in *mocked them*? the passions?\n\ni am wondering whether *mock* here has the meaning of creating a piece of art (like a mock-up), and so i'm wondering if the hands and heart are actually those of the sculptor, not those of the statue OR the portrayed pharaoh. but i am really at a loss. thoughts?",

        "text": "Reading the section between pages 306 and 321 of Infinite Jest. WOW. First, the multilayered metaphor that DFW employs. We start footnote 110 with a discussion of the inability of Americans to parse information. This leads to a discussion between Hal and Orin speculating on the nature of Quebecois insurgency. But there is a psychological tone being built between them, between youngest and eldest, one of denial on the eldest's part and refusal to understand by the youngest. Trauma, on both sides, dysfunction, etc. \n\nThis, on some level, starts to build a parallel with ONAN-Quebecois relations, and the ability for an individual part to both represent larger frustration within the whole (Hal's deterioration mentally speaking, Orin's denial of base frustrations, with another et cetera for the sake of brevity).\n\nBut the beauty here is the contrast between Orin and Hals relations and those of Hal and Mario, who is beginning to be painted as a Mishkin-esque character. Martyrdom as seen from Hal could be a reason for him projecting the rationale for the Quebecois insurgence's irrational behavior. And this is all very moving to consider, the magnitude of the respect that Hal has for his deformed, arachnid brother. \n\n.\n\n\nBut, the real beauty here is the use of structure to create a larger metaphor, and a richer dynamic between characters. Reading this I was first reminded of Gass's *The Tunnel* in terms of complexity of symbol building and use of character as object within larger story structures, and then it was Foucault's *Preface to Transgression*, and the discussion of creating positivity from the abject and vile. While DFW's execution is not perfect, you have to respect the complexity of his plot structures and how well it all comes together. \n\nJust kind of rambling since 12 hours have passed and I'm still blown away/",

        "text": "To provide some background I'd like to say I'm twenty nine going on thirty and since the age of eighteen(?) I've had a biennial tradition of giving up on Ulysses forty pages in. It wasn't that I would get frustrated, but that I felt completely lost. Puzzled I would close the book and it would be placed in the library return pile. \n\n\nWell, something finally happened: I let go and let the text wash over me. I stopped trying to look for meaning in every sentence, accepted that I'm just not on the literary level of James Joyce, and now I'm just along for the ride. With that mindset eventually came the pleasure. I will say there is going to be some minor spoilers coming up. If you haven't read it note that I don't think it's possible to spoil this book but feel free to dip out. \n\n\n\nThe moment I can actually mark when I finally started having fun with the book is when Leopold Bloom takes center stage. It's then when I realized how much of a living, breathing book Ulysses is. Stephen Dedalus is a drastically different character than Bloom and being in his head is a vastly different experience. Dedalus is such a pessimist that it's a bit of a drain to start with him. If Ulysses has defeated you I can highly recomment holding on tight next time you make an attempt until you get to Bloom.\n\n\nOne part I really like about Bloom's section is the way he takes note of the smallest things. Walking to a butcher shop he catches an advertisement for a Ginger Ale brand and it describes the Ale as \"Aromatic\". That Aromatic part pops in his head a few more times as he continues his walk. I had to grin because it really *feels* like how our brain works. I actually looked up the ginger ale brand and was surprised to find out that it was a real brand at the time. \n\nAnyway, I just felt compelled to make a post. I wont lie, I always looked at Ulysses as a sort of literary dragon I had to slay one day. I can't describe how much it means to me that I am *enjoying* my time with the book. I'll also admit that I know I'm missing ninety percent of references, allusions, and allegories. I plan on doing some after reading studying once I finish. \n\n\nHave any of you guys had a similar experience? ",
