I'm trying to inject some more riddles and puzzles into our game. So far here is what I've come up with.\n\nI've purchased a physical puzzle that my players will need to solve. In the game it will be acting as a key to a door. I'd like to present them with the solution to the puzzle hidden as the answer to a riddle. [Here is a video demonstration of the puzzle and it's solution.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRUqCumu1UE)\n\nGiven the motif of the cardinal points of the compass it uses I was thinking something having to do with maps and navigation? Again, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this question. Thanks for your help!",
