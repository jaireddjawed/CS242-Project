It will take a show I might actually like and enjoy and turn it immediately into something I simply can’t watch. \n\nIt’s grating, and it’s just weird as fuck the way characters have to stall through this disembodied laughter for multiple seconds every time they say something mildly funny. Not to mention the fact all this stalling and laughter probably adds up, like, by the end you’ve probably wasted two minutes of runtime on “hahahahahahahaha”\n\nI was just honestly wondering who will fight me on this point haha, give me your arguments pro-laugh track folks, if any actually exist. I’ve honestly never met one. Even folks who enjoy laugh track shows tend to dislike the actual laugh track aspect but tolerate it because they like the overall show (I tolerate a few myself for nostalgia reasons more than anything). \n\nAlso wondering why people in the networks keep green-lighting this crap. Shows like Always Sunny and Scrubs back in the day have shown you can do this kind of sitcom humour without it, easily. \n\nSo let’s hear it folks! What do you think? Why does it still happen?",

And even if the order of those seasons in quality is correct, it’s not be the degrees that is usually thought - S6 of Community is amazing and still some of the most witty, heartfelt, and original comedy television in the past 10 years. \n\n\nPaget Brewster and Keith David were great additions with some of the series most iconic lines. The dialogue continues to be fresh and entertaining, there are multiple great plot conceits, and some hilarious jokes. If there’s a flaw, it’s the lack of Shirley and Troy and that the series doesn’t really know what to do with Annie and Britta- but that had been a problem since season 3. Plus, the finale is remarkable.",

And another one that starts off of an African boy who is about to die from a spear being thrown at him, but god makes the boy untied and not hit by the spear.\n\nAnyways, I would like to be able to view these films again, if someone would be willing to help me.\n\nThank you.",

The TV show... starts interesting, they've added plenty of interesting scenes to the whole outbreak. It's cool to learn about how Ellie ended up with fireflies, the fungus infection looks quite cool and I like the explanation of the pandemic on the beginning of the show. However it gets a little monotonous after we fast forward 20 years. \n\nThe story sounds cool on paper, Joel tries to get car batteries to be able to search for his brother. The show (and the game) uses this part of the story to show how people live during the pandemic and it's done better than in the game (I still don't know why Joel and Tess needed the guns in the game). I'm also glad they didn't try to squeeze some romantic moment when Tess sacrificed herself to help Joel and Ellie escape. \n\nDespite the story sounding good when I think about it now I can't help but feel like it just wasn't engaging at all. I somehow didn't care much for Tess, I don't care much for Ellie and Joel either. \n\nAlso, the VFX is just bad. Broken buildings just look very fake. The level of fidelity of far below other high budget shows and movies (or maybe I just shouldn't compare it to Avengers). Clickers also look bad imo. \n\nThe choice of actors is also bad. Don't get me wrong, they're all good at acting but it's a little weird that they look so different than in the game. Ok, Joel is ok, can't find someone who looks exactly like a fake character from a video game but Ellie just looks completely different. \n\nI'm only watching this show because I like the game a lot and maybe that's the issue. It follows the story closely to what was shown in the game so there aren't any major surprises. Although I'm somewhat bored, I'm still glad they didn't change the story much. The game was quite slow at this stage too so maybe the show will get more interesting in the 3rd episode. \n\nDo you enjoy this show? Have you played the game too? \n\nI know it got great reviews but it would be cool to hear people's individual opinions.",

Every actor is phenomenal, from the the heavy hitters like Turturro, Arquette, and Walken, to Britt Lower and Zach Cherry. And then Adam effing Scott doing the best thing he's ever done professionally. Such a good show, and a real lesson in casting the right person for the right role. So, I know there's a lot out there, but what shows have for your favorite casted roles.",

He's an obnoxious, privileged man child and doesn't seem to actually care about his 'art' as much as he does about getting famous. I was just wondering if that actually changes over the course of the next season or does he stay this unlikable. And am I the only one getting the feeling that the show knows it too? Is this some next level meta commentary?",
