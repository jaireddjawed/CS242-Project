And the fact that we don't have enough information to draw the figure often makes the question completely trivial when choosing arbitrarily the other undefined components (for instance in this video by presh tawalker: https://youtu.be/gXgQ9SY5Cn0\nThe problem can be solved easily if you decide that 8 is the height of the triangle and so, we can use the intersecting cord theorem to compute the answer quickly)\n\n\nIs there some \"common\" figure that people used to geometry would immediatly recognise as having those constant values, or are there theorems to find out what are the constant inna figure, given a some parameters (and other parameters undefined). I'm also asking that because I suspect there is some method to know that, as in functions you can use the derivatives, in geometry the relation between the different components is less obvious.",

Every number in the series multiplied by a, corresponds with the x-axis. The y-axis corresponds with the index of the number in the sequence.\n\nI don't know what this could be useful for but I used it as a difficulty curve for a game I was programming. 'a' was 50 in my case so when your score went over 50,150,300,500,750 or 1050... the difficulty would increase.\n\nIf this is some dumb crap and this could have been done way easier then please tell me how. Also if this is already something famous or something please send me some reference because i couldn't find it online.(which is why I had to figure it out myself)\n\nIf you haven't figured the logic behind the series of numbers yet. every number in the sequence is the previous number +n , where n increases every time you go further along the series.",

I have a physics degree and I've been working my way through some \"pure maths\" books (e.g. Spivak Calculus on Manifolds, Baby Rudin, etc).\n\nI'm using \"Singularities of Differential Maps\" by Arnold, Gusein-Zade, and Varchenko, and the first definition already has me completely confused.  Is this because the language used is a bit old or is it because I'm missing some background?  The quote in question is\n\n&gt;A critical point of a smooth function is said to be non-degenerate if the second differential of the function at that point is a non-degenerate quadratic form\n\nAs far as I can tell, differential and derivative are two different concepts but I can't find out what the quote is supposed to mean.  Another sticking point is whether non-degenerate quadratic form means non-degenerate roots in this context.",
