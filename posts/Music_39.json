The band members received death threats, country radio stations stopped playing their music, and sales went into free fall; their latest single \"Landslide\" - a cover of the Fleetwood Mac song - fell from 10th to 43rd on Billboard Hot 100. \n\nLead singer Natalie Maines apologized for her statement a few days later, but would later revoke her apology. In 2006 they released an album titled *Taking the Long Way* and a documentary, *Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing*, addressing the controversy and its impact on their lives. The Chicks - who dropped Dixie from their name in 2020 - continue to record and perform today.",

Look at ‘Die For You Remix’ that song didn’t break any records, wasn’t that big of a deal but thanks to fans buying and streaming it topped the chart. People need to realize that just because they don’t like a song doesn’t mean others agree with their tasteless takes.",

Dave Lombardo just kills on this one and the solos by Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are wild along with the speedy riffs. The way it ends the album with the same riff/drums that start the album is epic.\n\nThe minor challenge was hearing the drums on this one while playing, had to remix it, making the drums more audible for me to play.\n\nThis one is good for intermediate level bassists and would good for bassists who are new to thrash and speed metal genres.\n\nOriginal Bassist - Tom Araya\nGenre - Thrash metal / Speed Metal\nFrom the epic 'Hell Awaits'\n\nHope you enjoy it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/a1noLxFneRc",
