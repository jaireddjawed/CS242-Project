        "text": "Hey, everyone.\nThis is my first Reddit post ever and I’ve been meaning to post this for a while now, so no, it’s not just break week happening.\n\nLike many of you I’m craving for some development for one of my favourite characters, the straw hats’ sniper: Ussop.\n\nOne of the things I’ve been thinking could come as a power-up for him, besides anything he might get from Egghead, though it might seem very late story-wise, is a devil-fruit. And I’ll tell you what fruit it could be and why.\n\nFirst of all, I believe it should be a fruit that improves his role as the sniper of the team, following on his father’s foot steps and his natural inclination as shown in the manga.\n\nSecond, it should fit his character traits and overall story arc, not forgetting his story so far but leading him to wherever he is planed to go.\n\nSo what fruit is it?\n\nThe Mushi Mushi no Mi, Model: Bonbarudiabītoru\n\nOr Insect Insect Fruit, Mode: [Bombardier Beetle.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_beetle)\n\n(I kept the model’s name in Japanese because oddly enough [Oda kept the other Mushi Mushi fruit’s name in Japanese also](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Mushi_Mushi_no_Mi,_Model:_Kabutomushi).)\n\nAnd why?\n\nFirst because beetles seem to be related to Ussop in the story: his weapon shares the name with a beetle species, the Kabuto, [his master has a very clear beetle motif](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Heracles), the first animal he encountered in his 2 year long training was a giant beetle and so forth…\n\nAlso, he has some leaning towards nature and insects: he and Luffy fanboy towards beetles, his chosen weapons are plants, he used to set spider battles as a kid etc.\nBesides his friends, the Tonttata are sorta insect-like and are also the users of the other two insect fruits.\n\nOther than that there’s the obvious reason of the Bombardier Beetle’s main trait: they shoot.\n\nBombardier Beetles have a combustion chamber inside them, so when they mix naturally occurring chemicals on their body they cause an explosion, sometimes a lot of them, going as far as 500 a minute.\n\nThey can also aim in a number of directions, making them one of nature’s snipers.\n\nSo it would fit him.\n\nIn his human form he can stay crafty and friendly with his fellow nakama.\n\nI’m his hybrid form he could gain a better weapon, because let’s be honest: Oda won’t give him a gun and he can’t possibly fight endgame characters like his father and Van Augur with a sling shot.\nSo in his hybrid form he could gain a natural gun in his body, some sort of [megaman’s buster](https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki/Mega_Buster) in which he could load his vast arsenal of projectiles and pop greens and shoot them faster, stronger and cooler.\nHe would also gain a lot of resistance as a Zoan specially because [beetles have their armour.](https://www.insidescience.org/news/scientists-discover-secret-beetles-super-armor)\nSomething else is [the fact that beetles are very strong](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/quirks-quarks-for-april-12-2014-1.2842931/as-strong-as-a-beetle-1.2842936) so maybe he’d be able to actually lift a hammer weighting some tons. \n\nIn his animal form he would be very small and able to fly so he would be able to run and escape any battle or hazard he might fear, with an extra advantage if he so wants: he could live a life with the Tonttata once everything is over.\n\nSo, what do you guys think? Is it possible? Likely? Or is this just rambling from a delusional person?\nLet me know.",

        "text": "I learned about aspects of One Piece before I started reading/watching it. It was a little jarring at first getting used to the Japanese style of ordering your name with the family name first and then your given name (hence why I'm not using \"first\" and \"last\" name to describe them) when even shows like Naruto reorder them for a western audience, but I got used to it easily.\n\nWhen I learned about Whitebeard and heard his name was Edward Newgate, I got a little whiplash since I thought family names were supposed to come first. I figured that was the point of making Whitebeard stand out and there would be an in-universe reason like him being from a special place in the One Piece world. However, I slowly accepted that Edward, for some reason, is his surname and Newgate is his given, further confirmed when Weevil got introduced.\n\nIt's just so weird to hear and I crave for there to be a reason Oda did this. I thought maybe it was because Oda doesn't have the same ear for western names as the names in his native language, but some other names are \"properly\" arranged. \"Robin\" is a common enough western given name and it's used as a given name, same with Bonney. Capone Bege is obviously named after Al Capone so Oda was able to reorder that to be consistent with Japanese naming conventions. But then you have Rob Lucci with the same issue as Edward Newgate; \"Rob\" being a shortened form of \"Robert\" but it's used as a family name here. Same thing with Marshall D Teach, Jesus Burgess, etc. And then you've got the entire Charlotte family using a traditional given name as a family name.\n\nOf course, maybe some of the eastern names are actually reversed as well and I'm the one without an ear for them and just didn't notice.\n\nI know I'm going crazy over nothing, I just need some insight, lol.",

I feel like a lotta you are busy reading Two Piece because some of ya’ll seem to miss every mark and lesson this series is trying to discuss. I have seen some of the most racist, homophobic, transphobic, classist, sexist, irredeemable people in this fanbase and it’s insane. Don’t get me wrong, that’s plenty of animanga fanbases, but cmon One Piece is literally the nonstop discussion of freedom and love and I see so much crazy shit going down within the fanbase.\n\nConstant racism from anyone of darker skin trying to cosplay the characters. People who are vocally supporting the series spreading the most hateful things online. The treatment of women in the fanbase is fucking wild sometimes (including SW and non-SWs) because that needs to be made clear. Some of ya’ll are just hateful and for what? \n\nThis is a series about being nice to people and not harassing them, assaulting them, threatening them, etc. I mean what should I expect bc I have literally seen people empathize and personally relate to characters like Kaido and Doffy 😭 you people are wild. Being mad about a series is fine sometimes, but some of you are ready to start riots when Kiku being trans is discussed, not to mention trans people in the fan base being treated like shit. How you gonna praise Bonclay and hate trans people mfs!?\n\nI’m almost positive if some of ya’ll could be like the damn World Govt and own slaves, especially WOMEN, you would. And don’t get me started on Fish-Man racism going out the door w ya’ll. The fish-man species would by lynched if some of ya’ll made it to OP.\n\nTbh that’s it, this fan base is full of excellent people. But a lot of you are shitty lol",

These are a show of gratitude towards several OP Universe Characters... I'm going to do them 1 at a time over the next couple of days/weeks however long it takes to get everything jotted down. For now, I am going to write a letter that Buggy would probably want to kill the author over :) \n\nLetter 1:\n\nDear Yonko Buggy,\n\nEver since we first met, your hijinks and shenanigans have caused me to smile Flashily. Prior to meeting you, I had always hatted clowns, especially the ones with the big red noses. However, over time you've won me over as a fan. You're no Luffy, you're not even Shanks, but you are in my opinion, a vital part of the story. \n\nAs Luffy grew, you did as well and I quickly learned that you are no pushover. In addition to being the only man to ever catch Straw Hat Luffy, you're the only one that has even come close to killing him. The only one that Luffy admitted was ever in a position to kill him. Fortunately for him and for you as well, his life was spared via a lightning bolt. \n\nAs the show moved on and you followed Straw hat into the Grand Line, I thought for sure that you'd just be a gag character. Something akin to Jesse and James from Team Rocket. Thankfully, I was wrong. Instead of just being a gag character, you were one with the power of luck on your side. Luck saw your way into Impel Down where you teamed up with Straw Hat. Luck earned you Captain John's Arm Band, a partnership with Mr. Three, Crocodile and Mr. One. Luck saw you galivanting through the Prison relatively unscathed. Where Luffy almost died, you managed to not only not die but to seem untouched by the horrors going on about you. \n\nTogether with Jimbe, Luffy and a couple hundred escaped prisoners, you crashed the Navy's party with White Beard turning the tide against the Marines. You stole a Video Snail and destroyed the Navy's narrative, giving the public vital information that their government had tried to hide. Big News Morgan was envious I hear. \n\nYou stalemated Mihawk, the world's greatest swordsman giving Luffy the chance he needed to save his brother Ace. Amidst the chaos, there you were trying to bring order. Standing in the breach, you gave hundreds hope so that Luffy could get to the scaffold. Having planted Mr. Three there as one of the replacements was a stunning stroke of genius. \n\nEven after all was lost. Ace dead, Luffy catatonic with grief, an Admiral hot on your tail and a weirdo in submarine trying to get your battered rival from your grasp, you still kept your head. Lesser men would have given up. Yet you with your one-time rival held tightly in your grasp, a friend, a brother in arms, you did not give into despair. Instead, you questioned the loud-mouthed lout, dragging his intentions out of him before entrusting your charge into his care. \n\nAnd with the war over, the battle lost, you kept your men together, rescuing them from the vengeful clutches of the Navy. You hid out, garnering the respect of even the World Government itself. From the anonymous depths of obscurity, you'd risen into the ranks of the infamous. A warlord. \n\nFor a while, you lay low, quietly gaining the respect of other powerful men such as Crocodile and Mihawk who were determined to join your ranks rather than be left behind by the annals of history. Swelling your ranks with such talent, you were ready to take on the challenges of rapscallions everywhere, when suddenly the government determined that you and the Warlord system were obsolete. \n\nInstead of becoming discouraged as others would have been, you stood your ground and did not flee the Navy. Spitting in their face, a just reward for the false friendship they had offered you, you broke their ranks and made for the open sea. An infamous pirate turned Warlord revealed his true power as a Yonko. \n\nAnd now like a master general, you are gaining wealth as well as a fleet that you will have at the ready for when Joy Boy comes again. Your Captain's last wish that you should guide him, prepare the way for him when he is ready. No doubt you hid in anonymity for all of those years waiting for Roger's prophecy to be fulfilled. Then when one who bore the mark did arise, you tested him again and again pretending to be his enemy. You pushed him and trained him in secret so that none might suspect you or your purpose. \n\nEach time a test was passed, you upped the ante and Luffy met your expectations. And every time, hope grew within your heart until you were satisfied with your choice. Knowing that Luffy will take up Roger's Mantle has made your heart giddy for the day when you might aid him in overthrowing the shameless and oppressive government that has reigned for 800 years. \n\nBecause of this, I thank you for everything you have done over the years. The patience that you have borne and the will to see all things that your former master charged you and Shanks with come to fruition. Thanks for watching over the future Pirate King and for guarding the gates that lead to the One Piece.",

        "text": "Hey all, I’ve been thinking about how Shanks could possibly be a representation of the Norse/Germanic God Tyr. Looking into the lore I’ve noticed some similarities between the two. First, both sacrifice a hand for the greater good. Shanks saving Luffy from the sea king while Tyr sacrifices a hand while trapping Fenrir.  Tyr is often seen as a depiction of a God of war, however Tyr is representative of Treaties and Justice. This fits with shanks for a multitude of reasons, from his dealing with the elders as well and him stopping the War of the best and negotiating terms of everyone leaving peacefully. All of this is on top of his connections with the Giants that we can see from chapter 1076. This is all speculation and I don’t quite want to say what I think Oda will do but I thought it was interesting to point out the similarities and see what some of you can take from it. Cheers!",

        "text": "Please delete this post if it is not allowed. I am not sure where else I can get this answer\n\nMy boyfriend is 20 years old and has been battling stage four melanoma (skin cancer) for the last 8 months. His cancer is very advanced and has spread through a few major organs giving him a poor prognosis of about 10-12 months. \n\nWe actually met through our love of one piece. We haven’t read the manga but we always watch the new weekly episode together. One big motivator for getting through his treatment is to live long enough to see the end of one piece. \n\nWithin the last week, he has been nominated by a not for profit organisation that grants a wish for a person battling cancer\n\nFor his 21st birthday this year we are going with his family to Japan for the first time which is really exciting.\n\nMy main question for this post, is it actually possible to meet Eiichiro Oda? \n\nI can’t find any information or any forum posts about anyone getting to meet him. This is something my partner would have never thought would be possible in his lifetime. I wanted to reach out to the one piece community to see if anyone has any information or can help make his dream come true. \n\nOne piece has been such a big part of his life for years now. I cannot imagine him losing his battle to cancer before the ending comes out. I just thought it would be so amazing for him to have the opportunity to meet the man behind it all. We haven’t chosen what his ‘wish’ will be used for yet, but since we are coming to Japan in June for his birthday I thought I wouldn’t know if it was possible to meet Oda for his wish if I didn’t ask\n\nI know there is nothing to back up the truth of my story I’m sharing. I can’t post the gofundme or the news articles written as that would go against the rules of self promotion. \n\nIf anyone has any information or has any idea how I could make this possible for him. I would do anything to make this wish possible for him. I will go to any lengths to help motivate him to keep fighting, to give him things to look forward to in the future and to show him he is constantly supported and loved. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story❤️\n\nLet’s see how the one piece community can help!👊",
