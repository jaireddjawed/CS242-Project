        "text": " \n\nI  usually buy Sheba's perfect portions by the 24 twinpack case and get 3 a  month for my spoiled cats. Last month they were only 19.98 (approx) on  Chewy, and if I had to run to PetSmart they were $11 for a 12 twinpack. I  went to the store last week to pick up some extras, and the 12 twinpack  was up to $15!!\n\nI figured they  were doing some internal price hikes because they had been hard to  source during covid and were almost always out of stock. Checked Chewy  this morning, and they're up to 25.98 now for my 24 twinpack cases! What  the heck! Last month I only had to pay around $65 for a whole month's  worth of food, and now it's going to be $15 more? Crazy. these are the  mixed varieties, too. The single variety twinpacks are up to $28.98,  when a few months ago they were only $19-23 based on availability.\n\nDry food is also up in price, but I don't have to buy that as frequently, so I don't really add that to my monthly pet expenses.\n\nIs there some sort of shortage again? Or is this just due to inflation?\n\n[Chewy Link](https://www.chewy.com/sheba-perfect-portions-seafood-pate/dp/167206)",

        "text": " \n\nWas on Facebook and saw a post by director Kevin Smith “celebrating” the fifth anniversary of his near fatal heart attack.\n\nHis post goes :\n\n5 years ago, I had a heart attack. Happy to be alive today, of course - but also sad for those I’ve hurt and the damage I’ve done since surviving. To borrow from “Pet Sematary”: Sometimes, dead *is* better. However, I’m not dead yet. So to borrow once more from a King: “Get busy living, or get busy dying.” As much as I want to, I cannot change the past. All I can do is make it better for today. So that’s what I’ll endeavor to do. Every day. Until the Reaper returns. Today marks my 5th week without weed. I feel less numb and more present than I have in 10 years or more. No judgment on my green friends, but this is how I want to live from now on. I weighed 285 pounds the night of my widow maker heart attack - 45 lbs down from my all-time high of 330 lbs. Today, I weigh 180 - my adult thinnest. Change is possible. If you’re green, you’re growing. If you’re ripe, you’re rotting. And I’m done being rotten. Every day is a school day. And I’m willing to learn. Memento Mori.\n\nSceen cap for context: [https://imgur.com/gallery/KaKcQU1](https://imgur.com/gallery/KaKcQU1)\n\nSo what's the deal? I lost track of Kevin not long after the heart attack and was surprised to him him share a post like this.",

After reading article posted along with a couple other Alaskan newspaper articles I came away with the following questions:\n\n1. Why is there full bi partisan support from the state legislators and national legislators? I understand why the GOP is in favor but to get support from the Democrats seems odd especially since Biden made the campaign promise to not drill on USA national parks/conservation lands?\n2. What is ConocoPhillips environmental record? Per Wikipedia’s page they rank 4th out of 120 companies by AERI? The BLM also seems to be on board but can these groups be trusted? There seems to be a lot of smoke around them being connected to big oil.\n3. What are the positives of green lighting this project? The article I posted up top mentions it will create 2,000 construction and 300 permit jobs but I feel like those are hollow numbers and those jobs will be non existent for the most part in 10 years. The other benefit seems to favor big oil as it has the potential to extract 100,000 barrels a day. I guess environmentally it is better than coal production but economically it sees to favor ConocoPhillips and it’s shareholders more than the local economy.\n4. What’s the deal with this land being sanctioned in 1923 for the extraction of oil? If that’s the case I feel like there were several times in history where the president could have okayed it but that didn’t seem to happen which makes me question why now?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Most of which centered around the GOP trying to nueter it with legislation and Biden promising to veto it.\n\nIt's my understanding that ESG is merely a score a company is given based on environmental impact, diversity and inclusion and employee treatment. I don't understand what makes this a big deal. It seems like if people didn't want to invest in \"woke\" companies they just wouldn't. What am I missing that would cause an ESG score to \"destroy my 401k?\"\n\nhttps://m.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-states-seek-to-block-biden-esg-investing-rule-3010816",

Those channels spoke simply about community layout design and how it can be optimized to reduce things like carbon emissions. Everyone can (and should be) within 15 minutes of all of their daily needs.\n\nI also live in Paris, and am experiencing firsthand the city going car-free. I think all of this is at best “good” and at worst “good, but perhaps unattainable for many cities”. \n\nHowever, I am also seeing people protesting this concept, as well as the following link (did I do that correctly? (this is my first time)) which suggests the cut-and-paste side of media is trying to get ahead of said protests by downplaying any concerns. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/syft/comments/11d82i8/looks_like_the_call_has_gone_out_to_the_media_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",
