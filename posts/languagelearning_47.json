        "text": "Hi all!\nAbout half a year ago I just decided I wanted to try harder to learn Spanish than what I tried back in high school. I took in person classes and try to speak to people as well as good old duo lingo. \nRecently though, I started dating a man in Morocco. He speaks almost fluent English, however most of his family does not. They all speak French and Arabic (Darija to be specific). I would love to be able to communicate with them more. But I know that French and Spanish are very similar and it is discouraged to try to learn both at the same time. However, the task of even learning regular Arabic seems so difficult to me. What would you choose to do in this situation? Any advice is appreciated!",

You can have Spanish audio with English subtitles on all of their original shows.\n\nOther streaming services don't seem very well set up for this. Paramount doesn't seem to have Spanish dubs at all. Crunchyroll has Spanish dubs but no subtitle support.\n\nAnything else that offers a Netflix type of language support? My favorite thing to watch for learning purposes is animated stuff, but I'm open to any suggestions.\n\nGracias!",

        "text": "Hi! I already posted this exact same thing on r/languagelearningjerk, but people said that was the wrong place! This is copied and pasted, by the way. Someone said I should post it here instead. So, that's what I'm doing. \n\nI was born in the US, and I have lived there my entire life. My parents are from India. My first language is English. I speak English every day literally almost 100% of the time. Recently, I took a flight to India, and the plane layover thing was in Turkey. At the airport in Turkey, I had never heard so many people not speaking English before! Like, of course, I knew that a much larger percentage of people would not speak English because like, I was in another country. But I have heard that a lot of people in like, tourist areas can speak English.\n\nAnyway, my heart was racing the entire time. A lot of people were speaking Turkish, and the whole time, I was just like, \"Whoa, this is literally so cool!\" The owner of a store said something to me in Turkish, like, I could understand what he said, but I was too afraid to say anything! On the flight from there to India, I was kind of sad because I was too scared to speak to anyone even when I had the chance, and multiple people had spoken to me.\n\nOn the second flight, I needed to use the restroom on the plane. There was a small line, and I was getting a bit bored. There was a place where some of the flight attendants were just kind of hanging out. They were speaking so quickly to each other! I was completely mesmerized. Then, one of them asked me in Turkish, \"Do you know Turkish?\" And I just kind of nodded, which was a really bad idea because I actually don't know the language very well at all! I know the basics, but I'm not good at it yet. I could understand maybe like, 25% of what they were saying. I was really nervous!\n\nI couldn't believe it. Someone was talking to me! (This part wasn't in the original post)\n\nThat same flight attendant person asked me, \"Is one of your parents Turkish?\" I said no. He asked, \"What about your grandparents?\" I said no again. Then he said, \"Do you live or study in Istanbul?\" Once again, I said no. I was sweating so much because this was the first time I experienced actually speaking that language in a real-life situation. I think he was kind of confused, but the look on his face was kind of funny! He also asked me if I wanted some water. And this is unrelated, but he thought I was a child.\n\nHe asked me where I was from, and I told him. I was so nervous; I was shaking my hands up and down and moving back and forth. I couldn't believe this was happening! He actually said I spoke it well, and that people think it's really cool when foreigners learn their language!\n\nAfter I used the restroom, I was thinking about that almost the entire time and smiling. I can't believe that actually happened. A native speaker of a language actually complimented me. That interaction lasted less than 5 minutes, but like, wow, it was absolutely incredible!\n\nSo yeah, I just wanted to share that really awesome moment!",

Any tips on how to get started? Also, any resources for this? I typically always start with textbooks, a bunch of flashcards and just a lot of repetitive work, but I feel like this is going to be in more of an immersion thing, but please leave your thoughts.",

It’s to the point where I won’t call my friends by their names because their names are French and I’m worried about pronunciation. I know it’s ridiculous but this is where I’m at with it. I’ve been addressing this issue in therapy and slowly working through it.\n\nToday I tried to order my coffee in English and the lady responded to me in French, I think she didn’t speak english, and I just switched and continued the whole exchange in French without hesitation. I really shocked myself! I didn’t know I could bring myself to do that. I have really great listening and reading comprehension but my speaking is severely stunted… anyways. I’m very proud of myself so I wanted to share this for anyone going through similar!",

I’m Norwegian, but left Norway to attend university in the UK at age 18. I’ve lived here ever since (I’m 33 now, so 15 years). My husband also immigrated to the UK at age 14, from India. \n\nIn the past 5 or 6 years, I’ve noticed that English has become my first language. It feels like my native language - it comes to me more naturally than Norwegian does. I think in English, count in English, my phone is in English, etc. Of course I can still speak Norwegian and do regularly with family, but English has taken over in terms of dominance. While pregnant with my child I’ve started contemplating whether or not I’d speak Norwegian with them. The reason I’m unsure if I should is that I’m not sure if it will confuse them. My husband plans on speaking Bengali with them, but my husband has not achieved the same level of English as I have, and his parents/family cannot really speak English. If I speak Norwegian with them, will he end up having an accent when he learns English at school? I don’t want that, I want them to be a normal British kid. \n\nAlso, I’m not sure it will pay off beyond being a party trick for my child. Mathieu will certainly prefer English no matter how hard I try, and all of my family in Norway speak excellent English, especially my parents (they worked in tourism). So what do you think?",
