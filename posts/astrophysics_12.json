(the Kessler syndrome) Civilizations effectively trap themselves in their own planets. Our progression halts itself before we become capable of interstellar travel. We are currently doing this, and maybe the reason we haven't been able to contact other intelligent life forms is they have trapped themselves in the same way we have. Intelligent beings inadvertently doom themselves to a single planetary existence. Just an idea.",

If we want to put a satelite on the Earth orbit we have to give it enough speed for that to stay in the orbit (and not fall down) but not too much so that it won't escape. We do it by engines. It seems that both Moon and Earth are in their respective speeds sweet spot (as none of them neither falls on the bigger obcjects or escapes it). But why are they rotating? What gave them the spin? What worked as a rocket engine in their case? Is it, for Moon, the collision of Earth and another planet (billons of years ago) that led to creating the moon - is that what gave the moon its spin? What was the corresponding event for the Earth's movement around the Sun then? ",

Here are a few of them:\n\nIs it true that we don't know why gravity works?\n\nThe larger the object's mass, the more gravitational pull it has on other bodies. Do we know why?\n\nIs it possible that gravity is the result of the \"wake\" in spacetime left by the object as it travels?",

Beggars can't be choosers. You can't expect to get the same shit as people that pay money or else no one would spend a goddamn dime on anything.

Plus it's not our fucking problem that you can't afford to put any money down on this game. Why the fuck do you care what people do with their money? Jfc are you in high school or something? Are you going to start bitching about how people have nicer clothes or a nicer car because they spent more money? Are you going to start bitching that it isn't fair for others to spend money on nice things just because you can't afford them?",

You're a bunch of miserable failures who must have thought: \"My self-esteem is terrible because I'm a severely retarded loser living in mom's basement who spends my free time making anime jokes on the internet that literally no one could ever find funny. How do I fix this? I know! I'll find a sub where intelligent people hang out, then ruin it with my incredibly hilarious elementary school 'humor' along with a bunch of my severely retarded friends! Maybe the emptiness inside will go away if I show all those smart people how funny (read: retarded) I am!\" Unfortunately no one beyond your weird little homoerotic group of mentally handicapped manchildren will ever think you're funny, so you're literally just jerking off into the mouths of your fellow retard failures. You people act like middle school children, but I'm willing to put money on the fact that you're actually adults, which is the saddest fucking thing I've ever witnessed. How much of a fucking failure do you have to be to act like a severely autistic middle school child on a science forum which you decided to ruin purely to put something on display which most moderately functional adults would be deeply ashamed of? The hilarious part of all of this is that you're probably so proud of yourselves for driving all signs of intelligence out of this sub, but at the end of the day those people are going to have their lucrative technical jobs that they worked extremely hard to achieve, while you pathetic cum stains just have your little buttfuck subreddit that you stole from people who aren't miserable failures like yourselves. 7-11 is probably the highest any of you can hope to aspire for, and even that's a stretch. So live it up while you can. The astrophysicists who used to hang around here don't give a fuck any more, but your lives are no less pathetic than they've always been. I'm guessing that your little embarrassing internet power trips are the only thing keeping some of you from killing yourselves, which you should honestly consider if you wanted to do some good in the world. Enjoy being useless scum on the bottom of the barrel of society while the smart people you've le epic trolled make money and contribute to humanity. Go die in a fire you fucking retards.
