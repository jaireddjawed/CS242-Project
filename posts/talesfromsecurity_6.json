        "text": "Working at a bar on a Sunday night (Last night). Manager gets a call from a guy named Rick Micheals (Probably fake). Says his truck was stolen had his wallet and atv on the truck all he has is a laptop. A real good sob story. Asks if he can come in without his ID because we don't let people in without ID. Manager okays him Tells us. I say \"fuck Rick Micheals I'm not letting him in\" Manger laughs and says \"well you'll be fired\" I said \"okay until then no rick Micheals\" I was joking and the boss man knew. \n\nSO we got Me Chuck, Dave, and Kyle for the security and Ed in for manager Other manager who took the call ended his shift. About 1:15 Rick comes in shakes Ed's hand at the front door. Goes straight to the VLTs. I notice he has a bag I tell Ed \"Yo he has a side bag should grab that.\" (We grab all bags and keep them at the front due to possible drugs weapons and such) Ed says \"It looks like his laptop it's all he had left\" He felt bad for the guy so he gave him a lil more cushion. \n\n2:30 runs around we kicked everyone out so we thought. Dave does bathroom check tells me and Chuck to get the guy out of the last VLT Bathroom. We head over to the door knock on it no response.\n Oh Goodie a passed out person!! Head back to Ed tell him we need the key. Head back to the bathroom. Hear some scraping then the tile above us falls through and it's this guys ass looking down on us Turns out he wasn't passed out he was crawling around the ceiling! I yell up to him \n \" Alright bud come down\"  \nEd tells Kyle to call the cops because he broke the tiles and is crawling around the ceiling. As Kyles on the phone the guy hops down back in the bathroom. Opens the door We can see the fear in his eyes. We take a step towards him he Yells at us \n \"Hands up!!\"  \nand points a gun at us! Ed was in front of me and a good thing to because my instinct was to jump the guy. He was 5'6 110lbs the gun was small still a gun and can kill but in the moment I would have lunged at him when he turned to the other bouncer who ran straight to the back door to open it. He ran out the back door as we all stood there with our hands up. Fun night.",

Well, dear reader, those things do not mix.  I was standing outside the room as the nurse was checking on him and asking questions when I saw him slightly heave.  The nurse saw it as well, and she knew what was coming.\n\nIt all happened in slow motion.  The heave, the cheeks ballooning, and the nurse dodging the stream of black liquid that erupted from the patient's mouth.  It spewed halfway to the door from the patient's bed.  The room instantly filled with the smell of wet earth, dirt clods and mud intermingled with vodka all over the floor.  The doctor walked in and saw the mess, and asked herself \"Is that coffee?\"  Before I could answer, I saw her sniff, frown, and mutter \"Nope.  That's dirt.  Thaaaaat's dirt.\"\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/43d0j4/hotel_security_is_weird/",
        "text": "So, after the Army, but before I got into my current job in Hospital Security, I worked in Hotel Security for the largest hotel chain in the world. These are my stories....\n\nhttp://www.myinstants.com/instant/law-and-order-dun-dun/\n\n**Texas Hockey:** So, Houston has a hockey team. Or we used to, anyway. I actually had to go check that they were still a thing, and they're not. R.I.P. Aeros. Anyway...\n\nWe had a group of players from somewhere in Illinois staying in the hotel. Where in Illinois? I have no idea. Does Illinois even have more than one hockey team? I still have no idea, because I'm from the Gulf Coast of Texas and it's Hockey. \n\nAnyway, so this team comes into town and spanks the Aeros. Just murdered them. Maybe that's why they aren't a thing anymore. So the team goes out to party after the game, high on victory and alcohol, and comes back to the hotel with their \"dates\", who are clearly girls they picked up from the club/bar. Some of them go up to their rooms, some stay down in the lobby to hit on the front desk chick (who was worthy of being hit on), and some go chill by the pool, because Houston in the winter can still be hot as balls.\n\nSo I'm in the lobby, keeping an eye on things, because the front desk chick is Scotty 2 Hotty for words (and we've been working together for a year or so, so we're bros), and the hockey players are all big, loud, and drunk. Not aggressive, yet, but drunk. \n\nSo the conversation ranges from this to that, and eventually turns to three dudes trying to pick the front desk chick (FDC) up. They wrangle me into the conversation. \n\n*\"Dude, tell her she's hot. Isn't she hot? She's hot, man, tell her she's hot!\"*\n\nI should mention that people who work night shift can have weird senses of humor. FDC and I were two of these, and we'd started messing with the drunks that give us problems. These guys weren't problematic (Like River Tam's food), but they were headed that way, so we started early. \n\nI glance at her, and then back at the guys with a questioning look, and shrug. \n\n**\"I mean, I guess. If you're into that kind of thing.\"**\n\nShe gives me a wibbly face, asks to be excused to go around the corner and compose herself, with tears in her eyes (in reality she was trying hard not to laugh and went and ran a nightly report). The hockey players turn on me, pissed that I'm screwing up their chances with this intelligent, attractive young woman.\n\nNow, they're all three bigger than I am, and they get paid a lot of money to fight while wearing blades on their feet and sliding across frozen water. I know there's more to hockey than that, but at the moment, that's all that's in my head. I start to think that maybe this wasn't the best idea, when I hear her voice from around the corner. \n\n*\"ISometimesCrit!!!\"*\n\nI quickly back away from the three, around to the other side of the desk (small wall splitting the desk) and find that another player is trying to crawl across the front desk at her, pants around his ankles. \n\n**\"What the hell are you doing?** I roar.\n\nShit goes from 0-100 real quick.\n\nI grab hold of the dude's collar and yank him back off of the desk, sending his beer soaked sticky self spilling to the floor. The other three come around and the biggest of them wraps me in a bear hug while the other two help their buddy up off of the floor. \n\nI manage to get loose and tell FDC to call the police, while I'm lamenting the fact that this is going to make for a weird eulogy at my funeral. The tallest of the group, who was clearly the leader of the pack, assures us that police won't be necessary. They'll contain their teammate, get him safely up to his room, and we won't hear from them for the rest of the night. \n\n.....and, we go from 100-0 just as quickly.\n\nThey were true to their word, though other team members had to be told off several times. \n\n1. Helped a guy to his room when he passed out in the elevator. \n2. Doing rounds on the Pool Floor, I hear a knocking at an exterior window in a conference room. I pull the curtain aside and see a woman's face mashed against the glass. Her bolt-ons were slapping against the window as some dude grunted behind her. When my loud voice and knocking didn't seem to faze them, I slapped the glass hard, right against her cheek. She looks up, and smiles. I shook my head and pointed towards the door, and they moved the party to their room. \n3. Found the same guy with a different woman in a hallway on my next round an hour later, and had to chase him back into his room.\n\n**Soccer Ball:** Just before I left that property to transfer to a larger hotel, I get a call about someone banging on the front glass doors (which were locked after dark). I go out and find this woman holding a bouquet of flowers wrapped in dingy newspaper that look suspiciously like the ones around our fountain out front. I ask if I can help her, from inside the glass, and she makes it clear that I'll have to come outside to talk to her. I step out, and she begins her rant. \n\n*\"They told me to come down here and stay here because my daddy's getting out of the Army tonight and they said that I have a room and I need to get in my room because my daddy's getting out of the Army tonight.\"*\n\nNow, we're at capacity (completely full), and it's 3 in the morning. I inform her that we're full, and that we don't have any open rooms. I ask if she's registered, if she has a key, blah blah blah, and she just repeats herself. She goes over towards the fountain and starts washing herself in it, and I put a call in to HPD. I follow her around the front drive, while she picks flowers, despite my protestations, and moves our traffic cones to the middle of the drive. \n\nI approach the cones to move them back, and she backs up quickly. \n\n*\"Why you creepin' on me? You don't know me! I could have a knife.\"* she says, holding an obviously empty hand out. *\"I'll cut yo' head off....kick it like a soccer ball.\"*\n\nShe proceeds to demonstrate a hopping kick motion until the police arrive and take her off to a shelter or hospital, since she was obviously not with it. \n\n**I Hate Vodka:** Once I transferred to the larger hotel, I started dealing with large scale events. Banquets, parties, conferences, etc., and we sometimes had a few hundred people to watch over at a time. \n\nOne New Years Eve, a vodka manufacturer that took it's name from a duck like creature decided to have a release for a new product, and do it at our hotel in the form of a toga or lingerie party. 2 drinks per person, 150 people max, they told us. They paid for that amount of drinks from our stock, and provided us with several cases of their new stuff.\n\nExcept that a major radio station decided to announce the party that morning, saying it was open to the public. \n\nSweet bouncing baby Buddha.....\n\nWe wind up with 1500 people showing up. Someone from the corporate office at Bird Vodka, Inc. pulls out their corporate \"Fuck You Money\" card, and says \"Make it flow.\". \n\nOne of the lovely things about working for an international hotel chain is that you have lots of resources to pull from in emergencies. This apparently qualified, and so our Event planners pulled out all the stops and we raided the liquor stores of five other major hotels. \n\nSo...many...drunks. \n\nBy the end of the party, around 0200 hours, the count was as follows:\n\n1. Four fights, two with injuries. \n2. 16 arrests, mostly for alcohol related stuff, but a few were for public indecency. \n3. $5500-ish in damages.\n4. Ass grabs (my ass, not theirs): 6 women, 2 dudes\n5. Junk grabs (my junk, not theirs: 4 women, 3 dudes\n6. Kisses (non-intentional): 4 before midnight, 2 at midnight, 6 after midnight\n7. Dudes falling out of their toga/lingerie: 3\n8. Ladies falling out of their toga/lingerie: 8\n9. Ladies straight up naked: Too many to count\n\n**Christmas in the skies:** We had several recurring contracts with various airlines to house their crews as they made regular flights from Europe to the US. One of the larger airlines based in the UK had people in house almost every day. For the most part, they were awesome. They were quiet, they followed the rules, and they tipped (not a regular thing for a lot of Europeans).\n\nOne Christmas they got stuck in the US. The hotel was damn near empty, being Christmas and all, so the Hotel Management decided to let them use one of our smaller conference rooms (still a sizable location) for their Christmas party, free of charge. We hooked them up with Christmas dinner, some free alcohol (which wound up being unneeded, as they had a good sized stash of their own), and two empty floors in both directions. \n\nTurns out, the empty floors weren't enough. \n\nI get a call about 2300 hours, about noise. I go upstairs, head to the conference room, and hear a ruckus, but nothing that sounds dire. I knock and announce myself. I hear the music stop, the lights go off, and through the crack in the double doors I see people running back and forth, hiding....evidence? Themselves? No idea. I knock and announce again, and tell them I'm coming in. \n\nThere's a definite \"whump\" sound, and something hits the door. I use my master key card, and the door unlocks, but won't open. Turns out they've dogpiled against the door. I sigh, and go around to the adjoining conference room. I go in, hit the side door, and find a large pile of British flight crew wedged against the door, giggling and snorting. \n\n**\"Um, what are you doing?\"** I ask. \n\nThey turn to look at me, surprised to find me magically inside the room, when clearly they'd blocked the door. One of them, (the guy I'd later find out was the pilot), stands up and brushes himself off. \n\n*\"Ah, well, my good man. We didn't want you to get in and see us in such a horrendous state. Didn't want to ruin the image the hotel staff has of us as good people, you see.\"* he says in a very upper crust type British accent.\n\nI just shake my head and chuckle. \n\n**\"Drunk doesn't mean bad people, ya know.\"**\n\nHe blushes. \n\n*\"Ah, yes, well...quite right.\"*\n\nI help him get the rest of the crew off the floor, and ask them to keep the noise down. They all apologize, and agree, and I don't hear from them for the rest of the night. They even cleaned the room up after they were done. Bagged the trash and everything. \n\nIn the morning, they all shuffle out to catch their plane home, with apologies to me and the housekeeping staff. They left tips, as usual, and I got a few handwritten letters from some of them (the pilot included) thanking me and the other staff for keeping their Christmas away from home a Merry one. \n\n**Most Awkward Lost &amp; Found Ever:** One of the things we did at the hotel (like most Security Departments) was Lost &amp; Found. If we had things that we could positively identify as belonging to someone, we'd hold it for them until their next visit, or ship it to them on our dime. \n\nOne week we had a volleyball tournament in town, and every hotel in the city was booked. Girls from middle school to college were EVERYWHERE. For the most part, besides the hotel being full, they were a non-issue. After, though......\n\nOur office was a glass walled room in the basement, just inside the loading dock and the employee entrance. When folks came in for their shifts, they'd sign out their key-card with us. When housekeeping found items that were left behind, they'd put it in a trash bag, tag it with the room number, and bring it to us to log it in and store or ship it. \n\nThe morning that the tournament left, I'm sitting in the office on Dispatch, and logging in the odd stuffed animal or pillow. One of the housekeepers comes by and drops off a handfull of bags. All with girls underwear in them.\n\nOkay, that's not awkward. \n\nThe other housekeepers start coming by, and I'm quickly surrounded by a mountain of stuffed animals and little girls' underwear. I'm in the middle of cataloging it, when I come across what I can only assume is named \"Penetrator 5000\". It's big, pink, and has what can only be described as appendages. \n\nSo let's recap....\n\nI'm sitting in a glass room in the basement. \n\nI'm surrounded by girls underwear and dead eyed plushes. \n\nI'm holding a pen in one hand, and a dildo in the other, making a list of these things like a serial killer......\n\nThe Hotel's General Manager walks in. \n\nI've never seen a smile fall from someone's face so quickly.\n\nShe steps into the office and asks, *\"What in god's name are you doing?\"*\n\n**\"Um.....Lost &amp; Found from the tournament, ma'am.\"**\n\nShe looks at the rubbery sword in my hand, and my logbook, and shudders. She calls my boss over.\n\n*\"I know you've been asking for blinds for the office so you're not in a fishbowl where everybody can see you. I think that's a good idea. We should get this office some blinds, don't'cha think?\"*\n\nWithout missing a beat he says *\"I think that's a lovely idea.\"*",

        "text": "So, folks seemed to enjoy my last post, so I figured I'd add a little bit more.\n\n**How long does it take to break into a car?:** So, this was something that we wound up integrating into our orientation for new employees to get them accustomed to securing their belongings properly. \n\nI was in the office one morning, doing paperwork or something. I get a call on the radio from our off Duty PD Officer, asking me to put a camera on a suspicious vehicle in one of our employee parking areas. I did, and found a truck circling around and around and around this tiny parking lot. \n\nThe PD Officer called for an on duty unit to stand by in the area, and got in his vehicle, just in case this joker was up to something and tried to run. \n\nI was watching the truck circle, and it finally slowed to a stop, right at the vehicle beneath the camera. I couldn't have asked for a better view.\n\nGuy jumped out, glanced up, face right into the camera, and paused, but decided to go ahead with the theft anyway. He took a screwdriver from his pocket, punched the door lock in (we timed it) .87 seconds, and was inside the vehicle in less than two seconds. He grabbed a purse, a laptop, and the radio faceplate, and jumped back into the truck, his getaway driver clipping another vehicle on the way out of the lot. \n\nThe Police officers on standby stop them before they make it to the next driveway, and they get carted off to the pokey. \n\nNow, I ask my incoming employees during orientation, *\"Who knows how long it takes to break into a car?\"*. Anybody that says less than 3 seconds gets pointed out. *\"Yall need to watch him/her, they know how to break into cars.\"*\n\n**I'm not a Nazi:** So, I've got tattoos. Lots of 'em, in fact. Up and down both arms, chest, back. Most of them are superhero related, Superman, Batman, Cap, Thor, etc, but a few aren't. \n\nI'm also a white guy. Enough Native American blood that I turn dark reddish brown instead of burning, and I've got brown eyes. I shave my head because I started losing my hair early, and it's much easier to maintain than actual hair, though I do keep a dark brown beard.\n\nI don't usually get shit about the ink, but when I do, I'm automatically a Nazi. \n\nLet me e'splain...no, there is too much. Let me sum up.\n\nI've got a tattoo on the front side of my right forearm that comes from X-Men comics. It's Rachel Grey's Shi'ar Death Mark. Black and skeletal and bird like. \n\nhttp://images-mediawiki-sites.thefullwiki.org/09/2/8/3/80820532514690164.jpg\n\nIt is not, in fact, a swastika. \n\nI've also got an off the wall of the tattoo shop flash Celtic armband around my right wrist.\n\nhttp://img00.deviantart.net/6381/i/2006/065/8/d/celtic_knot_armband_by_ppunker.jpg\n\nLike that, but with a skull and crossbones on the top of my wrist. It is not, however, a chain. \n\nSo I get called to one of our observation units about an aggressive patient. I go over, and the guy sees me coming down the hall. Now, keep in mind, I've never dealt with this guy before. \n\n**\"FUCK YOU! YOU KEEP THAT SONOFABITCH OUT OF MY GOD DAMN ROOM!\"** he shouts. **\"I DON'T NEED HIM TO TELL ME A GOD DAMN THING!\"**\n\nI keep coming down the hall, and he slams the door. Well, as anybody who's been in the military (I was) or has had police training (I did) can tell you, we can be a stubborn lot. Tell me I can't do something, and I'm like as not to do it anyway just to prove you wrong. \n\nSo I go in and try to open the door. He is standing on the other side, his foot wedged in front of the door so that I can't open it. \n\n**\"Sir, please open the door.\"** I ask, in my most polite voice.\n\n*\"Fuck you. I used to be a cop. I've got thirty years on the gang task force. I know who you are.\"*\n\nI'm confused at this point, because we've clearly never met, and the only organization I've ever been a part of that could qualify as a gang was the US Army. \n\n**\"Excuse me, sir?\"** I ask.\n\n*\"Yeah, I know.\"* he replies. \n\nI step back, and call for the PD Officer on duty, since I'm figuring we're gonna have to go hands on with this guy. He arrives, and is a no-nonsense kinda Sergeant who goes in and sits the guy down and tells him what a jackass he's being, while I wait outside. \n\nSarge comes back out, shaking his head, and chuckling. He shrugs the guy off, telling me it's all good, and we go back to the Security Office, where my boss, the Security Manager, is on the phone. \n\n*\"Yes, sir...no, sir....no, sir, that's not.....Uh huh.....no, sir....no, he's not....I can assure you he's.....Sir....Sir.....SIR......\"* \n\nThis goes on for a minute, before my boss puts the phone down, shaking in silent laughter. He composes himself, and picks the phone back up. \n\n*\"Sir, you're an idiot, and I'm not going to talk to you anymore. Have a safe day.\"* and he hangs up.\n\nHe turns to Sarge and I, and grins. \n\n*\"Why didn't you tell me you were part of the Aryan Brotherhood?\"*\n\nI'm confused as hell.\n\n**\"Uh....what?\"**\n\nMy boss laughs. \n\n*\"Yeah. Apparently your bird there is a swastika, and also...and I quote 'The chains on his wrists mean he's chained to the Brotherhood.'.\"*\n\nWe all burst out laughing, and that's the story of how I had to build and maintain a spreadsheet of all my tattoos and their origins for work.\n\n**Strong Southern Dislike:** So, we had a patient who would come in every six months like clockwork. She was named after a month, so we'll call her November, which was not the month she was named after. She had all sorts of issues, but the long and the short of it is that she'd get discharged from my hospital to a psych facility, they'd get her back on her meds and send her home, and she'd go off them again. Her husband would call EMS and say \"I'm sick of dealing with her shit, take her to the ER.\"\n\nThe issue we had is that the meds we'd typically give to help someone calm down from \"an acting out episode\" were meds she took on a regular basis. They didn't have the same effect, and so they just made her drowsy and pissy. \n\nShe liked to get naked and walk around the ED, shouting at the top of her lungs. And damn, did she have a mouth on her. My grandfathers were both in the military, I was in the Army, and then worked in chemical plants, and she said stuff that made me uncomfortable.\n\nSo, Mrs November came into the ED one day, and is sitting in her room, fussing about one thing or another, while I'm passing through the area on my rounds. I hear her voice, and immediately decide to stick around, since she usually causes problems. I hear her call the sitter an unkind name, and I step in. \n\n**\"Miss November. You know you can't be talking to folks like that.\"**\n\nShe rolls her eyes. \n\n*\"Not you again.\"*\n\n**\"Yes, me again. Now what seems to be the problem?\"**\n\n*\"I need ta your nate (urinate).\"*\n\nI look over at the bedside commode. \n\n**\"Well, that's why we have this here. I can step back out if you need to do your business.\"**\n\n*\"Well.......my huuuuzzzband....would have a stuh-RAWWWWWNNNNGG Southern Dislike for people watchin' his wife....YOUR NATE!\"*\n\n**\"Miss November........nobody wants to see that.\"**\n\n*\"Well....alright.\"*\n\nShe then proceeds to just pee in the bed. \n\nCat Jesus: This was one of the strangest delusions I've ever heard. \n\nGuy comes into the ED because he had some violent episode related to psych issues. No idea what they were, but he proceeded to explain what specifically he believed. \n\nWe were a non-smoking property, as most hospitals are these days. I take him out for a smoke anyway, because he's 6'8\" and solid muscle, so I don't wanna piss him off. We're standing outside, and we have the following conversation.\n\n*\"Ya know how Jeezus is a cat?\"*\n\n**\".....sure.\"**\n\n*\"Well, I wasn't gonna say nothin', but you seem alright, takin' me out fer a smoke and whatnot. I'm protected, y'see? Cat Jeezus put his cat blood inside me. It's fer protection from the witch.\"*\n\n**\"....oh?\"**\n\n*\"Yup. She lives in the walls wherever I am. She's killed millions, but don't ya believe her when she tells ya it was me. She's tryn'ta frame me, on account 'a the fact I won't give her my seed.\"*\n\n**\".............oh. That's, uh....that's a tough one.\"**\n\nHe nods solemnly, finishes his cigarette, and I escort him back inside to await transport to a psych facility. ",

        "text": "So, I've been doing Security for about ten years now, and am now the Manager of a Security Department for a small hospital in a major city. I've been reading work tales here and there, and figured I'd share some. Obviously names and locations will be changed to protect patient privacy.\n\nIke: I was working at my first hospital with this company, and had stayed at the hospital through Hurricane Ike to properly secure the facility. Mostly, this consisted of us evacuating as many of our patients as we could, and riding out the storm in relative comfort. We had massive generators, plenty of food stocked up, and comfy beds, so it was a relatively easy way to earn Disaster Pay and all the overtime I could handle. \n\nFirst day after the storm, the entire city is flooded, we don't do much at all. No visitors, only a handful of patients. \n\nSecond day, the waters start to recede, still not doing much. A few patients come in by ambulance, but we're still turning away visitors and outpatient appointments.\n\nThird day the people in the city find out that we have not only air conditioning (due to the previously mentioned generators), but also dry floors and power to charge their cell phones...\n\nAll hell breaks loose. We quickly have 1500 people outside our doors, demanding to be let in. The city Police stationed a bunch of officers outside, along with our Security, and some armed contractors we'd hired for the emergency, and for the most part, the crowd just mills about. \n\nThere was this one guy, though, that I'll never forget. \n\nHis underage girlfriend had come into our Emergency Department, in labor, and not having an easy time of it. We had her covered, no worries, but we weren't allowing ED visitation, since we were inundated with patients. \n\nSo this guy comes in, demands to see her, and when he's denied, he starts threatening my ED nurses. He's gonna find their homes, he's gonna come back to the ED with his boys, you get the drift. \n\nWhen my partner (a tiny 35 year old housewife) and I (an average sized, if a little big, 25 year old guy) approach him, he demands we let him see her. We explain the situation calmly, and then he tells us he needs to go back to give her his phone number. \n\n\"Your girlfriend is having your kid, and she doesn't have your number?\"\n\n\"Nah. I keep my bitches separate.\"\n\nWe offer to take the number to her, and ensure that she has it, but explain that we can't force her to keep him updated, and as he's already threatened people, we are certainly not going to let him back in the building.\n\nHe says the following:\n\n\"Man...muh fuckin' bitch ass nigga white people runnin' this muh fucka'.\" \n\nAnd he storms off. To this day, it's the most creative set of words I've ever been called. \n\nThe King: About three years ago I was working as a Security Officer in a large hospital in our division, and I'd been there for a few years. One of our duties was to sit with disruptive patients for safety reasons, whether it be for the patient's safety or for that of the staff.\n\nSo, I'm working day shift, and get a call to go to the building across the street from the main hospital, which is a part of our six building property, to sit with a violent patient, who we'll call \"The King\". \n\nHe's got a patient sitter, a buddy of mine, who stays with him 24 hours a day because he requires that much attention. This patient is mentally deficient in some way (not sure why). He's got the mentality of a toddler, is non-compliant, and is almost completely non-verbal. Yes, no, phone, go...that's about the extent of his vocabulary. Mostly it's just gestures and grunting.\n\nBlah blah blah, problems with his home situation, but no medical problems to speak of, so we can't transfer him to another facility. We've gotta take care of him until Adult Protective Services and the courts can work out where he's gonna go. \n\nSo me and my buddy, who we'll call \"Batman\", are hanging out in this dude's room, which is right off of the Nurse's station. The nursing staff have had it up to here with this guy, because he's smart enough to demand things, but not smart enough to understand why we can't comply with his demands. He demands to leave by gesturing at the door, and when told that he can't leave, he screeches and throws things. \n\nHe's also built like he was carved out of rock. Seriously. Dude didn't skip leg day or any other day. Strong as an ox, this guy.\n\nSo we're well into day two with The King. We've explained over and over and over that he can't leave, because the doctor says so, since that's the only explanation he'll semi-accept. He's had breakfast, and he is sitting in his bed, eating powdered creamer packets like they're ambrosia. No coffee, no liquid, just creamer powder. \n\nBatman and I are talking about gaming, and The King gets up out of bed and slowly approaches, listening. Wary, since we'd had to go hands on to keep him restrained before, we pause the conversation. He looks at us, a sly look on his face, and I take a step back to make sure I'm out of his reach. \n\nHe grins, and launches a gob of half moistened creamer at me, spattering my all black uniform with foul smelling milky liquid. Then he utters the only multi-syllabic word I heard him say during his entire stay.\n\n\"Nigger!\"\n\nHe grins even wider, and shrieks with delight, clapping his hands, as Batman quickly escorts him back to his bed. He starts singing the word, over and over. \n\nMost patients that I have to deal with either have some sort of psych problem, or have something in their system that doesn't allow them to control their behavior, be it drugs, or alcohol, etc. I can deal with that all day. No problem. \n\nNot this. This guy knew. He knew exactly what he was saying, or at least, the response it was designed to provoke. He did it specifically to get a rise out of me. \n\nIt was one of the very few times I had to walk away to keep from losing my cool with a patient. \n\nFirst Night: So, my first night at the previously mentioned large hospital, I was training with another officer when we got a call for Security assistance in the Emergency Department. We went running down the hall, and could hear the screaming from the moment we entered the department. It was like a banshee was being held captive. We found the off duty PD Officer that works in the ED standing outside the door, and he nodded me in. I pushed the doors open, and found the source of the screaming. \n\nA skinny girl, in her early twenties, was arched up on her shoulders and heels, bending her spine in a way spines shouldn't bend, being restrained by several nurses and techs and shrieking about people wanting to touch her inappropriately.\n\nNot complaining about it, mind you. Demanding. Demanding that someone...assist her. \n\nI should probably mention that she was completely naked, hence the closed doors. \n\nMy partner and I closed the doors again, catching the PD Officer chuckling at having let us just walk right into that with no warning. We grabbed gloves, donned them, and approached the bed. We replaced the nurses holding her arms, and our uniforms apparently caught her eye. \n\nShe fixated on us, and started demanding that we assist her in achieving fruition, shall we say, with our batons. Which we didn't carry. She screamed at us, demanding we comply. She managed to kick free of the nurse holding her ankles, and rolled her feet up towards her head, forcing her pelvis over her head, closer to us, as we stood at the head of the bed. \n\nWe managed to put her in soft restraints, cover her with a sheet, since she clearly wasn't going willingly into a gown, and the nurses gave medication to help her calm down. She eventually went to sleep, though she kept humping the air, the blanket, and the bed rail whenever she could. \n\nWe never did find out what was causing the behavior, but it made for an interesting first night...\n\nShopping for a husband: So, about a year after I started at this large hospital, I got a call to assist with an unruly patient. Most of the time, if I can, I'm going to try and de-escalate the situation. I might be able to take a patient in a fight, but I might not, and I'd rather not find out, so I try really hard to talk people out of fighting. \n\nThis patient was a woman in her forties, with her husband and teenage daughter in the room. She was fussing about something that I don't even remember, but wasn't violent or aggressive. Just fussy. She refused to listen to the nurses, the techs, the doctor, so they called me. \n\nCool. Sometimes a person with a badge, even if it's just a Security Officer badge, can calm things down just by showing up. \n\nSure enough, that's what happened. Her whole demeanor changed. She was polite, calm, and chatty. We talked for a bit, and I came to understand that she was having problems with perception. She thought she was backstage at the Rodeo concert, and her husband told me they were in the nosebleeds. She was best friends with a celebrity, and I was informed that she'd met the person once. \n\nShe turned to her daughter, who was probably 14 or 15, and said \"Sweetie, this is the kind of man you need. Good job, very nice manners...why don't you date him?\"\n\nThe daughter was absolutely mortified. \n\nI thanked her for the compliments. \n\n\"Well, I appreciate that, you're very kind. My wife would probably have a problem with me shopping for her replacement while I was at work, though. Also, it's kind of frowned upon when a 28 year old man takes a girlfriend that young.\"\n\nShe \"Pshaw\"ed me, and suggested that age was just a number. \n\n\"Yeah, but there's still that whole wife thing.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \n\n\"Well, if that doesn't work out, my girl just broke up with her boyfriend, and I'll make sure she stays available.\"\n\nI thought the daughter's face was going to catch fire, so red it was. The situation apparently calmed down, I told her and her visitors to call if she needed anything else, and thanked her for her time as I left. \n\nNOT MY GUMDROP BUTTONS!!!: So, I was sitting in the ED with Batman one day, on a patient that had been violent, but was now asleep. From the next room, we hear a voice that I swear came directly from the Gingerbread Man from Shrek.\n\n\"I'm just...I'm just so bored I wanna die.\"\n\nDude came in because he was \"suicidal\", though he later informed us it was just for attention. But I swear, he sounded just like the Gingerbread Man. \n\nSome of the more memorable things he said:\n\n\"I have a plan on how, too. There's a fake plant at my grandma's house. I'll probably eat that till I die.\"\n\n\"I don't want to cause problems. I just want to eat that fake plant. It probably tastes fake too. I wonder if hot sauce would make it taste better.\"",

        "text": "Tonight was a first. I spent almost 2 years in a hospital before moving to a much slower paced mall last year. I saw some things that would turn you hair white. I dealt on a regualr basis with people that the toughest of us would cross the street to stay the hell away from. But tonight? \n\nI think I saved a guy's life.\n\nWe have one of the big, multi level buildings that have the core cut out so you can see straight down to the bottom. At 10pm, my partner and I are locking up the outer buildings when we get a call for our presence. We wandered back over to the source of the call to find a drunk, lying on the floor with no shirt, flopping around in a stupor. Hardly the first time I've seen it. The guy is mostly out of it, though he seems to register that the Fuzz has arrived. He crawls under a bench to get away from us, and my partner and I go to the sides to keep an eye on him. My partner says, \"Hey, keep him away from the rail.\"\n\nThe next bit is about 3-5 seconds but seemed a lot longer. I realized that he is right next to the rail just as he pulls himself up. I asked my partner if I even said anything because I didn't remember after. Apparently what I had time to say was \"Aw, SHIT.\" I managed to get the guy just as his balance was starting to shift passed the point of no return. My partner was there a heartbeat later... but looking at the footage after, that heartbeat may have been the difference between getting him and watching him do a 50 foot swan dive. We got him on the ground just in time to have him vomit on us. \n\nI don't know what to feel. I don't know if he was trying to jump, or puke, or just get away. But realizing that if I had been a little slower that a life would have ended..... \n\nWell, remember gentlemen and ladies: this may be the night you make a difference. It may also be the night you get your shoes cleaned. Be safe out there.",

Weird, kind of late for someone to be doing laundry this late, I'll pop in and just say hi.\n\nOpen the door, and lo and behold it's not a student. Instead it's Joey. Now, while Joey might be a raging alcoholic and perpetually homeless, he's generally a pretty decent guy. He'll get loud and bombastic but I've never seen him even so much as swing at somebody. \n\nI walk in as he leans up against a washing machine, taking a slug from the pint of Black Velvet he's clutching in both hands. If you've never had this stuff, just imagine drinking tar. Pretty much the same thing. \"Joey, my man, what's up?\"\n\nHe looks at me, immediately confused as he slumps down against the machine. \"Ughh...w-what da fug are you doin' bro?\"\n\n\"Just chilling brother, same shit different day. C'mon, you know you can't be in here. Let's go, you live right across the street.\"\n\nI take him by the arm as he stuffs the bottle in his pocket, like I hadn't seen it already. \"F-fuck off, I'm...I'm married!\"\n\n\"I'm sure she's a lucky lady. Now get the fuck out of my laundry room.\"\n\nHe lumbered off towards his own place, somehow waving like I was his best friend and calling me a long string of expletives that would have made a sailor blush at the same time.

There was a joke around the office that your first shift alone something always went wrong. From a bull running loose to all the cameras going out, there was always something. \n\nThe first shift I took was a Sunday swing 1400-2200. Easy. Most of the state didn't shop Sunday due to religion. I'm excited and ready to go. \n\nThe first few hours went by and nothing big happened, then a homeless person is drunk and had wandered on property. No big deal. 2000 rolls around and I thought that I had gotten off with nothing going wrong. How wrong I was.\n\nI'm moving cameras around trying to get used to what I can and can't see with them, and I get a call over the radio from one of my officers. I can't remember what was said exactly, it's been so long, but here's what I do remember.  \n\nOfficer wanted our Sgt who had met training down at the middle of the mall. A person had been stabbed multiple times in the abdomen. Request dispatch call paramedics for transport to hospital and roll local pd out to the scene.\n\nI was terrified. I did everything I was supposed to, guy gets taken to the hospital. Pd comes out, ends up finding a blood trail off property.  We end up finding out what happened a few days later.\n\nGuy worked at one of restaurants in the mall, decided to go buy some drugs after work, just off mall property and had been stabbed as part of the transaction. He figured, correctly, that if he could stumble back to the mall that security would save him.  \n\nFrom there on in I knew the first shift anyone worked alone would be bad. I'm just glad I was the one behind the radio. I don't think I would have been able to deal with that situation in person as well as my officers did.\n\n\nTl;dr.

Most of the stuff we dealt with was pretty normal college fare: Minors with alcohol, drugs, car accidents, suicide attempts, facilities problems, you get the gyst. \n\nWell I'd been there for a solid year and hadn't gotten to have an actual \"vacation\" except for a couple day trips here and there. My boss was a fantastic guy, former detective and LT at our local department. When christmas came around he basically told me \"Go home for a week or two and get a break.\" Not one to turn down some time off, I agreed.\n\nMy parents were still living on the west coast and I was in the midwest. So I planned a 10 day trip home, made sure my shifts were covered, filled in the new guy on how to run weekends and flew home.\n\nI was four days into my vacation when one morning my phone rings. I roll out of bed, still mostly asleep and look at the number. Oh shit, it's one of the local cops we worked with at the school. This oughta be good. \n\nMe: \"This is Seatown93, what's up?\"\n\nOfc: \"Bro, you're the worst good luck charm I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nMe: \"Huh?\"\n\nOfc: \"You remember that bet we made a couple months ago?\"\n\nI thought back and immediately remembered what he was talking about. Like most cops, this guy had a really dark sense of humor that I just so happened to share. After responding to two suicide attempts and an \"almost\" overdose in the span of four weeks, he joked that we'd probably find someone dead before the semester was out. I said no way. \n\nMe: \"Yeahhhhh...\"\n\nOfc: \"Well, you owe me, because it totally just happened. I'm on scene now.\"\n\nIt felt like someone kicked me in the gut and I groaned. \n\nMe: \"Shit...student?\"\n\nOfc: \"Nah, one of the homeless folks. Investigators said he probably had too much to drink, stumbled over here in the cold (It was getting to be around -20F at night then) fell asleep and didn't wake up. No evidence of foul play so we're going with accidental so far.\"\n\nMe: \"I leave for a week and you asshats start finding dead people on campus. What the hell?\"\n\nOfc: \"Hey, not my fault you're cursed. Just be glad you're not writing the report, it's gonna be a looooong one.\"\n\nWe chatted for a bit and I called my boss. He verified everything and said he'd brief me more once I got back. Fast forward to when I return and we go through the details, I check out the report and it seems to be just what we had thought; bad accident, nobody at fault. \n\nMe: \"So...I'm guessing this means you don't want me taking time off any time soon?\"\n\nBoss: \"I can't stop you, but it seems everyone stays alive while you're around.\"\n\nFunnily enough, I didn't leave the state for my remaining time there and guess what? No more dead people on campus. ",

        "text": "Took me all day to find this subreddit, knew there had to be one. Here is one of my stories.\n\nRequired background reading: This happened 14 years ago, after I recently remarried after a 20+ year marriage that dissolved when I began seeing other women and became addicted to the thrill. After a year of being a playboy I finally married again to someone that knew my history and trusted me.\n\nMy first job as a Security Officer was working third shift at a well-known Hotel brand on the other side of town. This included Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nOnly a few weeks went by before I was tempted. One Friday night I stepped outside for my quick smoke break—standing outside watching the parking lot and entrance. (The hotel was conveniently placed next to a Mall so it was pretty fun sometimes.) As I begin to take one last drag of the smoke I noticed a Camaro swerve into the parking lot at a high rate of speed. (I just knew I better watch this one.) Sure enough, the driver pulls into a parking space and goes forward (so they are facing out when they leave) and stops suddenly. The car then shifts and backs up, trying to place the car evenly within the yellow strips of the stall. The driver moved forward again, still crooked and a little too fast, smacking into the car next to them.\n\nI went up to make sure everyone was okay, which they were, and radioed to the front desk that there was an accident and to call the police. A male jumps out of the passenger side and asks me if I called the police—I could smell the booze from 10 feet away. As I said yes a tall blonde woman wearing a knee length coat and looking like a million bucks (Imagine Trica Helfer from BSG) steps out of the driver’s side.\n\nI go back to the sidewalk were I was before the excitement began, my eyes watching the woman, late 30’s I think and at least 6’1” but still beautiful. About 10 minutes go by before I hear the sirens and the couple begin to walk my way. The man slips through the door to check in and the woman walks up to me close enough to smell the perfume and notice she was much soberer than the guy.\n\nI was surprised by the favor she asked for. “Could you tell the police that he was driving? I don’t have a license but he is smashed, they will take him away all night. I’ll make it worth your while.”\n\nI think the thought of what would be “worth my while” bounced around in my head for the fraction of a second…then I turned her down, telling her I was sorry but I couldn’t lie.\n\nThe police took them both away and they returned around 4am. Sometimes I wonder what could have happened that night.\n",

        "text": "So, I worked surveillance at a casino. 2 years of it. Fun job, honestly, and it pays well. One of the main things security does is what are called \"chip runs.\" Basically, a table needs more chips to cover buy ins/losses, etc. It happens probbaly 15-20 times a night (more from buy ins than losses, or they need to replenish low denomination chips).\n\nOviouslly, since it's as good as cash moving across an open floor, security escorts, and surveillance maintians camera coverage the entire time, at least until they are in the pit, at which point we have enough camears already there, we don't need to actively monitor.\n\nSo on this fantastic night, one opportunistic member of the general public saw what was about $13,000 in chips in the hands of a smaller, older individual, escorted by one guard. Clearly seeking the element of surprise, this specimen decided to grab the box holding the chips, and make a run for the door.\n\nObviously, security calls it up as a rush situation, so guards are converging. What slipped their mind though, was that I, in surveillance had access to the 10,000lb test magnetic locks on the doors. I saw which door they were running to, and engaged those locks.\n\nThe film from that incident, which I am sadly not allowed to show anyone but my coworkers and casino management is one for the ages though.\n\nYou see this long haired, scriffy looking guy grab the chips and beeline for the door, security on his tail. He lowers his shoulder to hit the door and go through. His shoulder hits, and stops. Then his head hits, hair flies all over the place, and he crumples to the ground, totally unconscious. Chips went everywhere, and were collected and verified at the cashier's cage before being sent out again. \n\nBoth police and ambulance showed up, and last I saw of the guy, he was getting handcuffed to the stretcher as he was wheeled out of our casino.\n\nWe may or may not have made a slow motion video of him hitting the door. (We do have ssome fun up there)",

        "text": "To set the scene, this happened at the hotel I work at on a cold, rainy Friday night. I apologize in advance for the length. \n\nI was patrolling and got a call that two guests were locked out of their room. I head up to assist them and when I arrive they inform me that they are late for their rehearsal dinner and just needed to put some things in their room. I try my master key, but the orange dead bolt light flashes, indicating that the deadbolt is engaged. I confirm that they don't have anyone else staying with them and that their room isn't connecting to anyone else's. At this point I figure the lock is just dead and offer to send them down to our hotel bar for a complimentary drink while we fix it and to put their bags in their room for them. They were very polite and gladly accepted. I have the maintenance guy come up to the room with the emergency dead bolt key. He uses the emergency key and I hear a surprised \"oh. Sorry sir. I didn't think anyone was in this room.\" I notice a man in a bath robe standing in the living room of the suite and immediately book it over to a phone and call the front desk. I confirm that this is the correct room, that the couple were the only couple checked in, and no other keys had been made. I inform dispatch, and as I turn to head back to the room, robe guy appears. \n\n&gt; Me: \"Sir, I'm very sorry, I'm not sure why you were put in that room. Did someone give you a key to get in?\"\n\n&gt; RG: \"I'm going to be honest with you. I'm in the CIA.\"\n\nCue internal freak out because obviously this guy is insane, which I don't have any experience with. \n\n&gt; RG: \"I've exposed some very important people and they sent me here. They told me this was a safe house. Obviously this isn't a safe house, so I have to go.\"\n\nRG jumps on the elevator barefoot, with nothing but a robe on, to go downstairs. I jump on after him and alert dispatch to call the police. Once we get off the elevator, he takes off into the cold, rainy night. I chase after him. Turns out he ran into our valet parking lot thinking he could cut through to the street, but there is only one entrance/exit. I corner him in the lot and try to talk to him to stall him. He keeps going on about being in the CIA and how he's going to get shot, etc. Finally, he realizes where the exit is and takes off again. Seconds later, the cops show up. I tell them where he went and go back inside, freaking out internally at the thought of having to tell these soon to be newly weds that some insane man had somehow gotten into their room. Luckily they had already left to go to their rehearsal dinner which bought me some time to assess the situation. \n\nThe next step was trying to figure out if anything was taken and to interrogate the lock on the room to find out exactly how and when this guy could have gotten in. As I'm standing at the room probing the lock, I get a call from dispatch that RG is back on property and has just gotten on to the elevator. Luckily I run into 2 managers in the hallway that had already been briefed of the situation. I asked one to stay by the door and make sure no one got into that room, and the other to start checking floors with me. I started at the top and worked my way down (there are only 6 floors). Most of our floors are shaped like a capital H, but the fourth floor has an extra little hallway at the top left corner that has a few rooms jutting off of it. it's a creepy, isolated part of the hotel and there are no cameras on the guest floors. Finally I round that corner and see our friend sitting there on the floor outside of a random room. \n\nI ask him what he's doing and why he came back. He said that he is locked out of his room and that he needs to get his things. I inform him that he does not have a room with us and that he is trespassing. I let dispatch know what's going on and he informs he police. I stand with the gentleman in the hallway for a few minutes before I realize that he really believes he's in the CIA and that he's fearing for his life. I ask him to please wait with me until an ambulance arrives so they can take a look at him and make sure he's not sick from running around in the cold. He agrees. But of course, it takes the police over 30 minutes to show up. \n\nI figure at any point this guy can take off and the chase will be back on again, so I decide to just keep him talking. I ask what he was wearing, what was in the room, what he touched in the room, were there any electronics, did he eat or drink anything, did he take a shower? He answers all of my questions with perfect accuracy (confirming the condition of the room). He also told me who was after him, what he did to piss them off, and how he had been traveling on a scooter but had it stashed somewhere. He was honestly a really nice, honest guy who has some severe mental issues. \n\nThe cops finally arrive, all 8 of them, escort him back to the room, find the clothes he had described to me on the bathroom floor, checked his pockets, checked the room, and arrested him. I was hoping they would take him to the hospital, but that didn't happen. \n\nAfter all the fun, we were finally able to determine that he had entered the room while housekeeping was in doing turndown and had the door propped open. He walked in the room, sat down and immediately started eating the food that was on the coffee table. The housekeeper thought he was the guest and left. I ended up having to be the one to confront the couple when they came back and luckily they were extremely understanding about the entire thing. There was nothing taken or tampered with other than the food and bathroom, and they just saw it as a great story to tell their kids someday. It turned out a lot better than I expected and I was in court 2 months later over the issue. Luckily all of the charges were dropped, he was banned from hotel property for life, and is being forced to undergo mental evaluation and treatment. I hope he gets the help he needs, and I'm glad things didn't go worse than they could have. ",

        "text": "This was the first occurrence report I ever had to write, but remember it well.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur company was one of several subcontracted for a large annual city-wide event, ~10000 people in the city (town/whatever). Through the middle of the city is a canal, with bridges that can raise up and down (literally the pavement is raised straight up, not folding up from the center). On the last day I was posted at the far side of the bridge from the event, which took up the main street. My post orders were, and I quote, \"Keep drunk people from continuing to walk when the bridge is up\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOccurrences on this final night include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n-Pair of guards using a call sign that sounded like 10-78 getting reamed out and told to change it (Emergency/Need assistance)\n\n-Man waving to police, they waved back, then he pissed on the building beside them\n\n-Man running up and down the street with his arms outstretched, trying to slap everyone he can\n\n-Couple having sex on one of the benches. All roaming guards attended, applauded, and had them move along\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNear the end, I was sitting on the curb bored out of my mind shooting the shit with another guard who was patrolling a nearby park. Bridge alarm sounded and I watched a man finish crossing. When I looked back across I saw a man on a bike weave through the traffic barriers (think railroad crossing) and start crossing. I yelled at him to get off the bridge, the bridge started rising, and then he sped up.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, about 13 feet up cross beams start that are nearly flush with the rising bridge, meaning after that point he can't feasibly get off the bridge. I'm watching him thinking \"you can't be this stupid\" as he's trying to race the fucking bridge. Gets to my end, throws his bike over the edge, and he's now too high to jump off, so he sits down on the edge and hops off. Keep in mind this is about a 10 foot drop straight down, he had no room for any forward momentum.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe hits the pavement screaming and I lose some time as I go over there. I had two radios; security and bridge operator. The bridge radio was on my belt and the security radio was on the curb to my left, while the bridge was on my right. I managed to lose the bridge radio and pick up the security one when I lost time. I call it in and start running through the head to toe check, then the last man who crossed the bridge comes over to help. Who is he? A fucking paramedic. Fantastic, competent help! Points out that both his ankles are broken (turning purple, yup he be fucked up). I get him laughing in under a minute and admitting his stupidity, and when he was eventually wheeled off he was all smiles.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe greatest part about this is he couldn't have picked a better time for this to happen. Me and the paramedic are trading off talking to him when I'm not talking to my supervisor, and the other guard I was talking to is just standing nearby writing down EVERYTHING in his notebook (loved that guy so much after). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe questionable problem we had is that we were directly under the counterweight for the bridge, which stopped about 4 feet above the man. I couldn't think of a reasonable way to secure his ankles to move him with 3 people, and I knew that weight would stop, so when the paramedic suggested we move him I nixed it. What I didn't know at the time is that for liability reasons, the bridge operator is not allowed to touch any controls while we are under the weight. This left my supervisor LOSING HIS FUCKING MIND on the other side of the bridge, like I can literally see him pacing and he's radioing me every minute for an update, because he can't get over here. EMS has to drive out and around the whole city to get to us too, which took nearly half an hour.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo yeah. That was my first occurrence ever. I was taught a bullshit way of writing a report (my biggest issue is I was told I cannot write someones name until after I learned it, so if I didn't know someones name until the end of the incident I have to refer to them as \"Male 1\" the entire fucking report. Repeat for all persons. FUCK that). Good first experience though, seeing as I wasn't alone for it at all.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOh right, why did this moron cross the bridge? Because he only lived two streets away and didn't want to wait the 20 minutes for the bridge to come down. ",

        "text": "Special event in a community centre, my first mistake was thinking it'd be easy since no alcohol is being served. My second mistake was thinking I was told everything about this party when I specifically asked for all the details.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI went with 3 other guards, I was supervising. We arrived 30 minutes late due to being stuck behind a snowplow for a long portion of the drive (1 hour to the site under normal conditions). I had to collect the money from the client, who didn't want to pay for the 30 minutes we weren't there.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCue first problem. I have the invoice, I do the math in my head but want to double check with management because I don't do invoices. Supervisor says call the owner. Owner answers the phone and is obviously drunk. After 15 minutes I manage to get off the phone with him. He has, with a calculator, given me 4 different numbers at this time, none of which were my number. I went with my own math.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGet paid and get event details from the client. The theme is ABC's - Anything but clothes. The lineup is full of people in bathrobes, caution tape dress, duct tape, etc. And ALL OF THEM HAVE BACKPACKS with their normal clothes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I post my guards as instructed; smoke pit door, emergency exit by the bathrooms, and the last with me at the main entrance. Then I do the math; 300 people, 4 hour event. Call it a minute of two per person to \"by the book\" search a backpack full of clothes (we touch nothing, they have to empty the bag themselves). Not happening. We can't really search most people either. So I make the call; no searches of bags, all bags go against a wall near us, and we will just have to watch people as they go to backpacks to make sure its only money they are grabbing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPeople get wristbands as they go in, which is how we know who can come back in from smoking. Great, wonderful. First problem comes from the client, who complains that we let someone in who was thrown out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"We haven't thrown anyone out, we are just here for the doors.\"\n\n\"No my chaperones threw them out.\"\n\n\"What chaperones?\"\n\n\"I have a bunch of teachers inside who will throw people out if they see them drinking or smoking inside.\"\n\n\"Thanks for telling me. Which door did they throw them out? Did they take the wristband off?\"\n\n\"I don't know\"\n\n\"Well if they throw anyone else out they must go out this door.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo now I'm banging my head against a wall. MY first person tossed was a guy who went to the washroom 4-5 times in 30 minutes. I went in after him, he was drunk, sweet talked him to his backpack and out the door. Client then points out a male who she asks me to remove because he is high on LSD. Well I just plain don't trust her judgement at this point so I pull him aside and chat with him. His eyes were really wide, not bloodshot though. Spent 5 minutes talking to him, seemed perfectly normal except for the eyes. He let me search him thoroughly and I found nothing, so I let him go back in. He comes up later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNext complaint I get is that there's a guy inside with a knife. No they don't know who he is, where they are, or what they look like. I do a walk through of the floor and advise the client, and we find nothing out of the ordinary. We jointly decide to continue the event but she will let the chaperones know, I let the guards know.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShortly after I get two more complaints, one person actually knows the knife wielder as the brother of LSD guy. I advise the client that I have enough information to be comfortable calling the police, and I take the three outside while we wait. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShortly after LSD guy comes out and walks up to me, telling me the client said I needed to talk to him. I go inside and she says again that he is high on LSD and he can't come back in. I come back out and tell him the police were on the way for some small complaint and needed to talk to him along with these other three. He was fine with that. One of the witnesses asks if he can wait inside, I say sure just don't go far. Police arrive, I advise them that the complaint is that LSD guys brother is inside threatening people with a knife, and LSD guy loses his shit in pure shock. His face was priceless, no violence though. Police see something I don't and take him aside, I tell the sergeant I need to get one other person and go back inside.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy last witness was curled up in the fetal position crying just inside the door, no one in the crowd can get him to talk. I get a story out of him that LSD guy kicked his ass and threatened to kill him if he saw him again and starts showing me the cuts and bruises he has. Ffs. I get him up and have him walk out with me, he tells his story to the police, LSD guy gets cuffed for drugs and this threat. He is known to the officers, as is his brother, whom we later find out left before police arrived. Police promise a restraining order and will pay the brother a visit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe have no other issues for the rest of the night, and find a bunch of those small \"travel sized\" bottles of liquor on the floor during cleanup. Police decide to stay for the last 45 minutes of the party, as they have been called out to this building 3 times tonight (other events in the building). Sergeant looked inside at the bags, looks at me, and says \"Next time, no bags.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"No shit, but I'm not the one running the show.\"",

        "text": "Ok, I don't work in security but this happened to me this evening.\n\nI live in the UK, and my flat (apartment) is in the city center. Because of the limited space available both inside and out, we don't have anywhere to recycle cardboard, plastics or glass etc. Our city is so determined to get us to recycle that they have on the spot fines for putting recyclables in the normal rubbish bins.\n\nUsually, we don't really bother with recycling because we don't create a lot of waste to begin with - plus the on the spot fines aren't really enforced anyway.\n\nSo this evening, I had a load of old electrical items which I was disposing of at a local 24-hour drop-off point (Speakers, DVD player, hair curlers etc) but there was nowhere to dispose of the boxes which I'd been keeping them in.\nThe boxes were a bit beaten up so I decided to find somewhere to recycle them. I remembered reading in the tenancy agreement for our flat that we are allowed to take our recyclables to the local authority's office car park where there is a number of recycling bins for all manner of things - excluding electrical items.\n\nSo I drive over to the local authority's office and it's completely empty, although it is well lit. So I park my car up and take about half a dozen cardboard boxes from the boot. I take them over to a waste bin marked \"Paper &amp; Cardboard\". I notice out of the corner of my eye a pile of LCD monitors, but I go back to my car and grab the rest of the boxes. I return to the bin and dump the rest of the boxes and have a quick look at the monitors, purely out of curiosity. All of them are Dell, probably 22\" or thereabouts - interesting to see thrown out considering they looked practically new. Yes, I do subscribe to r/dumpsterdiving as a lurker, but I only have a small flat and my days of having a shed filled with ex-corporate IT equipment are over.\n\nSo I go back to my car and start reversing out of the small car park. I hear a knock on my car windows - which scares the hell out of me because it's about 11pm and I haven't seen a single person here.\n\nI stop the car and turn to see a security officer next to my car so I open my window.\n\n**\"What are you doing in our compound?\"**\n\nI explain that I just dropped off some cardboard boxes for recycling.\n\n**\"Why were you looking at them screens then?\"**\n\nI told him that I was just curious, and that I didn't move them anywhere - let alone take them!\n\nHe peers into the boot of my car to see it's empty. He seems a bit less aggressive now.\n\n**\"That's fair enough, I wasn't accusing you of anything\"**\n\nI explained that where I live, there's nowhere to recycle cardboard, and as I was instructed in my tenancy agreement, I've brought it here to recycle. I explain that the boxes were completely empty, flattened and that I didn't throw anything else in there.\n\n**\"Oh, that's fine. I just saw you on the camera and wondered what you were doing.\"**\n\nWe had a quick chat and I explained about the lack of recycling facilities at my home address, and that I hardly ever bring them here but there was rather a lot of cardboard to throw in the normal rubbish.\n\n**\"Yeah, I have heard about that, but nobody actually brings anything here usually.\"**\n\nWhat probably looked like a suspicious character driving up to their office late at night, poking around their old IT equipment turned out to be nothing more than an honest citizen recycling some cardboard boxes.",

        "text": "A little bit of backstory here. This was a long time ago, I'd say about a year ago or so. My security company had a contract with a local DSHS office. It was a pretty comfy place to work. I honestly did nothing but watch stupid youtube vids on the computer with my partner, patrol the buildings and look at security cameras. My partner and I would take turns with the computer, and this day was their turn. This office building was pretty big. There were a total of 4 buildings, and in the middle of them was kind of an open area. The employees used it as a smoking area and people would eat lunch outside as well during the day when it was nice out. It's not really hard for someone from the public to walk into, but you'd have to know where it is to actually realize it was there. They also require a key card for basically every single door in the building, which was understandable as this was where their main data center was, and held a lot of personal information.   \n\nIt was about 10pm that night, pretty typical day. A few employees who were working overnights as well as the maintenance crew and janitors were still there, nothing special. It was my partner's turn to watch the cameras and mine to use the computer. I was minding my own business, doing some paperwork whilst browsing facebook, and my partner gently taps my shoulder, with a completely horrified look on her face and is absolutely speechless. I ask her what's wrong and she just points at the monitor with her hand over her mouth. Just when I thought I had saw it all, humanity throws a curveball at me. I see on camera a bearded man clad in raggedy clothes pressed up against one of the vending machines outside. I thought it was odd and I giggled a little.  I proceeded to gather up my vest, hat and badge before I go ask him to leave, until I hear my partner shriek \"OH MY GOD, HE'S...HAVING....SEX....WITH THE VENDING MACHINE..\". At this point I'm almost on the ground laughing until my sides about turn to jello. I make my way outside to where he is, and sure enough, there he is. Half naked, pants around his ankles trying to give that vending machine a one way ticket to Poundtown. I've been told I've got a great poker face but I just couldn't help but release a giggle that resembled that of a school girl's.  I, as politely as I can, ask him what he's doing. He turns to look at me, with a deer-in-headlights type of expression, his lips tucked in and his uhh... love gun...inserted into the coin return slot. He hesitantly replies with \"I'm just making love with my wife man, why? You wanna join or somethin bro?\". I'm trying not to laugh as hard as I can, and I inform him that it's a vending machine, to which he replies with \"NO. HOW FUCKING DARE YOU. THIS IS MY PARTNER AND WE ARE MARRIED.\" He proceeds to then bend over and grab something out of the bottom slot which your snack is supposed to come out of.\n\nAt this point, shit gets from absolute hilarity to serious business. He reaches down and grabs something from the dispensing slot at the bottom. I didn't know exactly what it was at this time, and it's definitely within the realm of possibilities that a drugged out homeless man had a weapon in there. I quickly reach for my maglite that can easily double as a club (I was only licensed as an unarmed security guard at this point.) and order him to place his hands where I can see them. To my disbelief and relief he pulls out one of those plastic rings you insert quarters into and get a plastic ring. He waves this around as some sort of proof that he's married to this vending machine and begins to shout \"SEE. IM MARRIED TO HER YE FUCKIN  COCK SNOT. AND YOOOOOOOU CAN NOT HAVE HER!\".  Now this guy is really getting on my nerves and it stops being funny (of course when I look back it's all funny as sin). I raise my voice a little bit and sternly ask him to leave once more or I'm calling the police. Well, he doesn't seem to like this much, but he at least steps away from the vending machine, waddles over to one of the nearby benches and takes a seat. Mind you, these benches were made up of  concrete, and at 10 at night, that sucker is going to be cold. He begins to reach over to the ashtray, pull out a half smoked cigarette, lights it and calmly says \"Go ahead. Call the cops, they don't have the balls to arrest a pregnant man.\". \n\nAt this point I got a serious case of the fuck-its and just call the police. There's a police station not even a mile away so the response time is pretty quick. They come over, arrest the guy, and as I'm standing by, he keeps shouting \"DON'T HURT MY BAY BAAAAAAAY. I'M HAVING A CHILD YOU PRICKS LEMME GOOOOOOOOOOOO\". While in handcuffs he keeps trying to grasp at the vending machine. I go back inside and though my partner seemed to be scarred from the incident, I was having a good laugh. Whoever you are, homeless guy, I do commend you for being able to sit down on an extremely cold stone bench in the middle of the night bare naked without freezing your balls off. Hats off to you.  \n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: Worked at an office building, pregnant homeless man makes love to a vending machine outside. Gets arrested. Partner is probably still in therapy. ",

I was just starting to work graveyard and I was chilling in my office getting my paperwork and gear ready for the night when I hear this over the radio. I grab my stuff, get in my car and head down there giggling like a school girl, yet what I found was the exact opposite of funny. Here's what I found when I arrived at the location: A hairy, presumably drunk homeless man resembling a miniature Chewbacca, and the new guy, scared shitless (no pun intended). He just stood there in awe with his flashlight repeating the same phrase \"S-Sir, please refrain from defecating on the railway\". I tell the new guy to just sit there and let me deal with it. With every step, I can better smell what can only be described as is: fecal matter, mixed with some pretty bad BO and a hint of whiskey. When I get close enough to the man for him to acknowledge me (I wanna say about 15-20 feet). I see all of his clothes spread out on the railroad tracks, a nice big turd inside of a hard hat one of the railway employees seemed to have left there. Doing my best trying not to puke, I, as politely as I can, ask him to please leave or at least step off the railroad tracks and come with me. After about 5 minutes of dealing with this guy, I tell the new guy to go ahead and give the police a call as we're instructed to by the company if there's a trespasser who refuses to leave. While the cops are on their way, the guy begins to then run up and down the railroad tracks and eventually trips and let's out a blood curdling scream followed by, and I quote: \"HOLY TIT BISCUITS. I. JUST. BROKE. MY. DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK\". I finally catch up to him and see that he just has a scraped knee. By this time, the cops had just arrived, so one of the officers was dealing with him and I was giving my statement to another one as well as the new guy. Homeless guy ends up peeing on the officer, getting tased, and thrown into their car. After that, I never saw the new guy again. Don't know if he quit or got transferred, either way, I don't blame him.. ",

It was a bright, and cold, February day when we got a fairly normal call from one of our most \"kid friendly\" stores. They had a little boy who was 5 or 6, who had been there parentless for about an hour.  As I was dispatch at the time, I sent one of our guards over to see what was going on. The boy had been told to wait there, but we brought him back to our office anyways of course.  I pulled out my stash of crayons and coloring books (I always had them near me just in case). After he had calmed down we got him to tell us what had happened. \n\nThis little boy had been dropped off at school that morning by his mothers boyfriend, who had told him to get on the train after school, and head up to our mall, and wait for him at the store we had found him in. I had the ever so fun job of calling the local pd, and explaining this to them. For the next two hours, I waited with this boy and got to know him, even though I had clocked out. When pd did show up, I asked what was going to happen, if they had found his mother (being a mom now, if my kids bus is 15 minutes late I start calling the school and bus company). The officer informed me that no one had reported a missing child, but they were going to take him to a group home for the night. They left, and I was determined to check up on him. \n\nI called the next day, but still no one had come to pick this little boy up, or had reported him missing. The day after his mother finally reported him missing and they found out that he had spent about 45 minutes on the train from his school to our mall. After that, I tried, but having no relation to the boy, and not being a case worker, I couldn't get anymore updates on him. \n\nI wonder what has become of this little boy who is now probably in high school. \n\n",

As far as I can see there was no justifiable reason. Apologies if this is the wrong place but idk where else to get an answer. Just trying to understand.  ",

        "text": "... They blocked YouTube, our only source of entertainment while we sit in this tiny ass box in the middle of the road with nothing else to do at 2:00 in the morning.  \n\nI'm sure you *all* know the pain.  I work on a medium sized manufacturing facility and the only entrance to the property is where I'm located.  I see everyone that comes in or goes out, and there aren't very many at all during the night.\n\nSo we watch YouTube videos all night.  Until now.  \n\nI'm in my final months until I've finished college.  I'm going into I.T. and I can't understand the need to block YouTube so that the guards are unable to watch it in the middle of the goddamned night.  \n\nThey *specifically* targeted the post computer, too.  None of the other computers I've checked on this site are affected.  \n\nThe hosts file was modified yesterday so that YouTube.com would direct the browser back to their own intranet website.  I assumed one of the airhead guards did it accidentally or as a prank so I fixed it.  \n\nWell today I come back, and the hosts file has once again been modified.  Only this time, the user account has been changed so that it no longer has administrator privileges.  I can't fix the hosts file, so now YouTube is gone for good.  \n\nI just don't get it.  Who gives a shit if a couple of guards are watching YouTube at 2AM when practically no one is coming or going?  WHO CARES?  Am I supposed to stand here at attention all fucking night staring blankly ahead until someone decides to pass by? No.  If someone walks up, I always notice them.  It's not like I won't see someone coming just because I'm not looking dead ahead.  \n\nIt isn't a matter of backups either, because YouTube is pulling down and backups are going up.  \n\nThis is nuts.  I understand blocking it everywhere else because it would hinder worker productivity, but what the fuck kind of productivity do they expect from the guards?  It's not like we have any set workload.  We have a huge amount of downtime.  \n\nI'm probably going to change jobs since I can go work for another company and make more and *still have YouTube*. ",

        "text": "I work security at a small hospital in the states and this story involves one nuisance that lasted a work week.\n\nIt all starts near the end of my first patrol round on Monday afternoon.  I'm checking the employee parking lot on foot when all I hear on the radio is \".... and bring some gloves.\"  It sounds like it came from my coworker so I ask for clarification.  \"We're needed at \"X\" building and you should bring gloves.\"  OK, odd.  I start to walk through the hospital to get gloves and get to the destination when my phone rings.  It's my bosses boss.\n\nAfter pleasantries.\n\nBB \"What do you know about a naked person on the property?\"\n\nMe \"I just called out to building \"X\" and told to bring gloves.  I imagine it involves that but I don't have details yet.\"\n\nBB \"OK, Don't hesitate to call the Sheriffs and keep me informed.\"\n\nAbout this time I've arrived on the opposite end of the property, with gloves, and have found my coworker talking with a member of hospital staff.  That staff member informs us that her subordinate told her about a naked man in some bushes.  I send my coworker around one side of the building while I search around the other.  When I meet him on the other side he tells me that the staff member got a description and a different area to look in.  A white male who is skinny with gray shaggy hair lying in the bushes near the main entrance.  Just what we want people to see as they leave the hospital.\n\nA quick walk to the main entrance and I get an eyeful.  A naked old man with his rear-end in the air covered in feces.  Did I mention it's Monday?  One eyeful is all I need as I turn around, dig out my cell phone, and call the sheriffs department.  While on the phone explaining my problem I move to an area where I can watch the naked guys area just to make sure nothing changes while waiting for deputies to arrive.  Naked guy will now be called Defecating Bum or DB for short.  It is a very long five minutes.\n\nThe local Deputy arrives and after a brief introduction he starts talking to DB who now has pants and a shirt on.  A brief conversation occurs and the deputy walks back to me to inform me that DB claims to be sick and he has to call emergency medical services, EMS.  DB gets to go to the hospital.  Not jail.  DB is on hospital property so he will get a $400 ride 800 feet into the ER Department where, you guessed it, I get to deal with him more.  Me and my Bosses Boss are amused at how he plays the game.\n\nA little about The Defecating Bum.  He is homeless by choice.  He hasn't bothered with a job in about 20 years.  DB is emaciated,  skinny legs make his knees look comically large. He panhandles long enough to buy a couple beers and that is all he needs to get wasted.  He has also worn out his welcome at most of the homeless shelters in the area.  He has spent time in jail.\n\nThursday of the same week and The Defecating Bum has spent three days admitted into the hospital, After being discharged in morning he went back into the ER Dept, and finally discharge again on my shift in the early evening.  An ER Nurse rolls him out in a wheelchair with instructions.  \"DB, you have a bus pass, you need to go home or to a shelter.\"  DB will if given a chance stay in the waiting room all night.  So I take initiative \"DB, I'm going to take you to the bus stop.\" After finding out from him if he wanted to go north or south, I don't think he wants to go either way, I roll him out to the bus stop and get him to move to a bench.  I think I've won in getting rid of a vagrant who should be in jail.\n\nA couple hours later I'm on another walking patrol and decide to go out by the bus stop.  DB has found a few vagrant friends and they are having a pow wow at the bus stop.  I instruct DB that he needs to catch the next bus,  I don't want to find him on property tonight,  I will have him trespassed.  As I'm leaving I notice DB has an open can.  I can only tell that it's a can not if it's alcoholic.  I walk away with the understanding that this isn't over.\n\nOther tasks and duties take me away tell the last hour of my shift when I decide to take a walk out to the area of the bus stop and the ancillary buildings only to find DB, no surprises, sleeping under a tree on the property.  Guess he can be trespassed now.  The Sheriffs arrived to issue a trespass warning to DB and if he doesn't comply he will go to jail.  I've done it.  Victory right?  \n\nAfter the Deputy gives DB five minutes to get to his feet and get off the property it's become apparent that he is now a liability to the both of us.  DB admits that he panhandled enough money to buy some beer.  His light weight status making a small amount of the devils nectar enough to incapacitate himself.  Guess where DB is now going.\n\nMy post's ER Department.\n\nGuess I can call it a Pyrrhic victory as DB is now trespassed from the hospital so if he loiters after being discharged I can get him a one way ticket to jail but did I really need that much paper work?\n\nTLDR Defecating Bum uses his bum to defecate all over my work week.",

        "text": "So I've recently gotten a side job doing security for an Irish pub close to where I live (and also pretty close to my normal daytime job). My normal job at a nonprofit organization is good, but I've been spending like crazy and needed to get this side job to get my savings account back to where it needs to be. \n\nThe owners are great (decent pay, free cigs/food/beer) the staff are cool, and most of the customers are regulars with some college kids thrown in. I mostly work the door, checking ID's and helping to shut down the bar at night. Aside from a few fakes and some people that needed to be told to leave, I essentially do nothing. I've had the job for a few months, and there have been no fights even though this bar is on one of the major \"party\" streets in one of the busiest cities on the East Coast. \n\nMy question is this: am I really being paid good money just to sit on my ass for 8 hours? I have no desire to get in unnecessary fights, but I almost feel as though I'm taking advantage of my new boss because nothing really happens and I'm never really needed. I've heard from others that a big guy like me being there usually deters fights that might've otherwise happened, but I'm not sure if that's true.\n\nIs this normal? Are you all just a bunch of lazy fucks getting paid because no one knows that we do absolutely nothing most of the time? Or did I just happen to land the best bouncing gig ever?",

        "text": "Good evening, night, or early morning SecuriGuys and SecuriGals! Today's tale is one of woah, followed by woe. \n\n\n *(Fancy melodic transition music)* \n\n\nIt was a warm, and muggy night in my nation's capital. Warm enough to draw out both the lovely interesting folks, as well as the homeless. I spent my remaining moments of non-uniformed bliss just sitting quietly in the public smoking pit. Usually I would avoid the pit (as the homeless like to cause problems), but that night, well, I must have craved some human interaction.\n\n\nAnd so I puffed away, just enjoying the thought that maybe someday, I could be awake while the sun still held the sky. The fog of my ~~daydreams~~ wakeful-nightdreams was dispelled however, when a nice elderly lady sat down next to me. She broke the silence:\n\n\n**OL:** \"It's quite a nice evening! Isn't it?\"\n\n**Me:** \"It is! I just hope the heatwave stays away for good this time.\"\n\n**OL:** \" I agree completely! Too hot my ol- Well what do you suppose *that* man is doing?\"\n\n\nAs soon as I turned my head I knew trouble brewed. A lanky, ragged, angry looking man came limping out of the forest next to the hospital. If it had been any more cliché, I would have thought he was a zombie. Before I knew what was happening the old lady was walking away, and this man now sat next to me. I never found out his name, but he looked like an *Andre*:\n\n**A:** \"Oh h-hey there bud... Y-You got any s-spare smokes I could bum off ya?\"\n\n\n**Me** (not wanting to deal with him): \"Sure, two good? Need a light then?\"\n\n**A:** \"A-Absolutely! I-If you don't mind... (I gave him a lighter) Thanks. Pretty fucking h-hot out isnnit? I c-can't fucking stand this shit.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Yea... But at least it's not 35 like yesterday.\"\n\n\nAnd then, just as things seemed normal enough to relax, one of the hospital's security guards (a black guy) walked by laughing.\n\n\n**A:** \"Yea, I s-suppose that's tr- **Oh yea just keep fucking walking you fucking (racial slur omitted)!**\"\n\n**Me:** \"Woah, k, ah, jeez... Um, I don't really think-\"\n\n\n**A:** \"**Back in the GOOD old days, we used to fucking (graphic description omitted). With one of THESE!**\"\n\n\n*And suddenly there was what looked like a large metal knitting needle in my face. I don't know where he got it, or where he was keeping it. I guarantee somewhere out there, there's a giant grandma who's very sad she can't knit giant sweaters with giant cats on them. Although, to be fair, the guy had it so close to my face that I'm pretty sure it tickled my beard.*\n\n\nAnd so happy-funtime was over, and he definitely didn't stop with racial slurs. Suddenly every person within 50 feet was getting called some obscure angry term that I could only imagine racists and evil people think up when there's only their kind around. \n\n\n*If you've watched community, and you remember Pierce's father, then you're on the right track.* \n\n\nWhile he was distracted by yelling at cars, I quietly alerted the other security peeps (those currently working). I tried to avoid his attention as I made my way towards my section, but just as I got to the door he called out-\n\n\n**A:** \"**Thanks for the smokes bud!**\"\n\n\n-before being absolutely surrounded by big black dudes in stab vests... \n\n\n\nAnd so: I don't use that pit anymore...\n\n\n**Tl;dr - Late one night before work I met Andre, two free smokes did he take for an entré, then he pulled out his spear, spewing insults and jeers, forcing me to sit near a new ashtray.**",

        "text": "After a brief stint working as a part-time Police Officer, a job I loved but well, part time and in a location I didn't like, I ended up moving back across the country, finishing my degree, and decided the whole civilian thing was getting old and to go back into the military life. However, with the current way things are, my ship date was like 6 months into the future, and my Peace Officer cert was only valid in the state I came from. I needed a job to tide me over until then, and I was pretty over-qualified to do some shitty security job and I knew with my background I could get flexibility to juggle enlistment stuff with. So anyway, that's the background.\n\nI shot my application off to a couple major security firms, who called me back right away and set up interviews. A friend of mine also recommend I apply for a small in-house resort security near us, so, shit, why the hell not. They also call me back, literally as I was walking out of the building where I dropped off my application and resume. Good signs. I apologize, explain I'm not really dressed or have documents prepared for an interview, but agree to return tomorrow. I also explained that while I didn't have the required certifications for this state, I was in the process of getting one and could expect to have one by the time I came into work.\n\nI put on some nice clothes, print out a few resumes and certifications, etc, arrive 20 minutes early. Yeah, it's a shitty security job and I don't need to do this, but old habits die hard and I figure it's good practice for life. Can't really be too professional. So this is where things started getting weird.\n\n\"Hi, I'm here to Mr V.\" \"Okay, fill out this application.\" \"...I already filled that out, I have a copy if you need. Mr. V wanted me to come in for an interview.\"\n\nShe looked at me kinda confused, but then waved me through. I stood in the hallway for a while, about 15 minutes, with nothing happening. A woman comes out and explains that Mr. V and the head of security are not in today. Well then. I double check that my appointment was indeed today, and yes, she explains, but apparently they had a busy weekend so he decided not to come in today. Huh. \n\nI leave a message for him explaining that I \"must have missed him on Monday, but would like to interview with him later if he has the time.\" \n\nI leave a couple more messages over the week, until I get a message more than a week later saying, \"We can't hire you because you don't have your guard card (I actually did have it by that point).\" You know, the thing I explained I didn't have when I first scheduled the interview. I attempt to call them back, but the receptionist doesn't know how to transfer calls and keeps disconnecting me instead of transferring me. At this point, I'm like why the fuck am I even bothering, but I like to finish what I start. I finally just ask her what the extension I need to call is, and leave a message explaining that, yes, I do indeed have all required certifications, the state processed it all.\n\nAnother few days later he calls me back wanting to schedule an interview... for being lifeguard. He makes no mention of the previous mess at all. I explain that I was in fact applying for a security position.\n\nWhatever, I'm getting this done but at this point I'm like 99% sure I don't want to work for this outfit. I iron my clothes, show up 20 minutes early, and check in. As I'm waiting, someone comes out and explains that they lost my application packet, and would like me to fill out another one by hand. Holy shit. I call my friend (my application was saved on my computer back home) who relays all the contact info/address/references on my application. I get halfway through finishing when they come back out and say, \"Oh nevermind we found it.\" Christ, this is bad.\n\nI sit down with this superstar HR guy, Mr. V and the resort's head of security. \n\nThe head of security suddenly launches into me about my police background, why I was working for a short time, and challenging me. It's pretty clear he thinks my resume is fraudulent. He repeatedly asks me over and over questions that imply I was fired for misconduct or something. It's also pretty clear he didn't actually bother to call any of the references I provided for the police department, you know, during that nearly two weeks I had given them my application until I actually showed up for an interview when they bothered to show up.\n\nYes, it was pretty unusual for a sworn and armed officer to be working the short time I had before leaving, but fuck, you could have checked all of this before all but calling me out.\n\nMr. V then remarks, in a suspicious and condescending manner, that I \"must really, really want this job\" because I've been calling him so many times to schedule an interview. No, motherfucker, I think to myself, it's because you can't fucking show up and take a week to return my calls. But, I smile and say some bullshit about hearing really great things about the security here.\n\n\nI'm a very calm person, but after about 10 minutes of this, I just have to be like, look, this is the phone number for my shift supervisor during my time with x department. You can verify that this number belongs to the police department with an internet search. \n\nThey direct me to an empty ballroom, and say they'll be right back. Almost a half an hour goes by when they finally come back, thank me, and tell me to expect a call by Monday.\n\nThe very next day, I filed my application with a well-known security firm (a large one), who hired me on the spot and offered me a position within walking distance of where I lived, flexible days and hours as long as I could work nights, and better pay, and they'll pay for additional certifications. Awesome. \n\nA whole week goes by (it's now thursday, interview was on tues) when I get a call back from Mr. V offering me the job. I attempt to call him back, and the receptionist again keeps disconnecting me every time I ask her to transfer, until I dig up the right extension again and call him directly.\n\n\"Sir, thank you but I'm going to have to respectfully decline.\"\n\n\"Okay- wait, WHY?\" he sakes me, shocked.\n\n\"Um, personal reasons.\" \n\nAfter their clear demonstration of their inability to handle documents, I was also really worried about my personal information being in their hands, so I ask them to shred my application. Mr. V refuses, saying it's \"company property\" and he wants it for when I reapply. Wow. \n\nSorry it's long, I'm still jaw-droppingly stunned at this man and his organizations not only sheer incompetence but their total lack of awareness.",

No post orders or explanation so I just did my patrols and noted anything that was odd. Was told to patrol once an hour.\n\nIt was October 31st, so shenanigans were expected. During the night I observed a large number of people entering the building with large amounts of alcohol. There was a party on the 3rd floor since the start of my shift. Somewhere around 2200 I found three people in the stairwell with a 24 case of beer, 6 smirnoffs and a 40oz of vodka. I asked if they were hosting a party and they said no, they were going to a birthday party on the 3rd floor. Why are you in the stairwell? \"Oh we're just waiting on our friends with the rest of the booze\".\n\nTwo more people come in with another case of beer and more vodka/smirnoffs and up they go, and I follow them to the party room. So now I know where ALL these people have been going with their beer. Around midnight I bang on the door to tell them to quiet down, and someone bangs back. Call my supervisor, tells me to call the police. I call the non-emergency number and am told by dispatch that they don't deal with noise complaints, bylaw does, but I'll have to call bylaw on monday because they don't operate on the weekend. I call my supervisor back and tell him what happened, and he tells me just write it in my report.\n\nNext patrol I find many broken bottles on the floor of the 3rd floor, some were not empties, and more in the stairwell. I call my supervisor again, and am told to write it in my report.\n\nNext patrol, blood on the walls and in the stairwell (not someones dying amount, smears hear and there). More broken bottles, party still going strong. Call my supervisor and update him, told again to write it in my report.\n\nFinal patrol, holes punched in walls, some broken bottles near the main entrance as well now. Call my supervisor who is now on his way to pick me up and drive me home, told again to just write it in my report. I clock out at 0400, report goes under the door of landlords.\n\nNext day I get called by management asking me what happened, they tell me 911 should've been called, and they will be \"dealing with\" the supervisor. At 0700 the landlord read the report, found the party still going (11 hours at this point, minimum), and called the police. Lots of property damage and cleanup because I was too new to the job and my supervisor was useless.",

He wouldn't return a single \"Good morning sir!\", or when he did, he spoke with a tone of disdain for the pleasantry. He once even went so far as to yell in my face for daring to make him wait five minutes to be let in (how dare I use the washroom!). This man was bad enough that I even suspected that he must have a dying marriage or something (nobody is that consistently mean for no reason). He once tried to get me fired because I asked that he show me his DND pass (no pass, no entry, no exceptions). \n\n\nBut anyways, I digress: I sat at my desk awaiting my daily encounter with the bully. As the time neared 4 am, I knew he would soon arrive. But wait, something strange was occuring! 0430 rolled around, no captain... 0500, still no sight... I decided to sit outside and await his majestic arrival. And then I saw it....\n\n\n\n*The man had decided to come to work via the most awful mode of transportation: Ruck March. As he arrived I noticed that he looked especially pissy in his full kit and ruck sack. I opened the door for him, and before I could even say a thing he produced his DND pass. He swung his arm straight forward, and with the momentum of a hundred angry koalas he fell onto his face and arm. With a loud SNAP I knew that this once-mighty officer was about to be a very sad man in need of assistance.*\n\n\nI knew it hurt his feelings to accept my help, but I couldn't just leave the guy there (with a ruck pinning him on top of his likely broken wrist). I will concede that at first I chuckled internally at his pain and shame, but that was short lived. I pretty much gave up my grudge against him in those following moments, and he seemed pretty happy to have the help after all was said and done. Eventually I got him clear of the ruck, and walked him over to the civillian emergency sector of our hospital. He thanked me as sincerely as I've ever been thanked, and I hoped that from now on our work-time interactions would go smoother. In the end he had a broken wrist, a broken pinky, and a gash in his chin. Nothing permanent....\n\n\n...I couldn't let him off that easy (I'm petty, what can I say). \n\n\nSome of you might not know this, but military personnel are some of the best/worst gossips in the world. All it took was a teeny tiny account of the respected officer's fall and.... well... *somebody* even posted a dramatized newsletter of the event. \n\n\n\n*As a side note, a PO2 actually told me to have a \"Navy-Great Day!\". I miss the navy.*",

This guy was absolutely massive. We'll call him The Hulk.\n\nMy supervisor is the one doing the talking, being calm and friendly with him asking him to leave. The Hulk is just a broken record asking \"why? why? why?\" and my supervisor is beginning to lose patience repeating \"you've had too much to drink. you're too drunk. blah blah\". Eventually, my supervisor begins to get a little more aggressive, and The Hulk just stops responding. We're all getting ready to start wrestling this guy out of the door.

We are all flabbergasted, and my supervisor says \"Fuck it! Pick him up and carry him out\". We each grab a hunk of flesh, and begin walking him down some stairs, where he begins to wildly flail, causing someone to let go of his leg, and the rest of us to let go in a domino effect. The Hulk smashes his head again on 2 or 3 stairs.\n\nWe pick him up again, get him through the door and out to the sidewalk where he flails *again*, and smashes his head AGAIN on the concrete, and is now bleeding out of his head. \n\nBy some miracle he still has the capacity to jump back on to feet, and is still quick enough to land a punch one of our bouncer's face. The bouncer responds in kind, returns a punch to The Hulk's face, where he falls **AGAIN** resulting in one final encore of smashing his head on the ground. \n\nThere might have been 100 people standing outside of the bar laughing uproariously. The hulk, who must've had a [skull as thick as Homer Simpson](http://i.imgur.com/BqUdfi7.jpg), picks himself back up, dusts himself off, and walks away.\n\nTales from security.",

        "text": "First post, and I'm very excited to have finally found a place to dish some of my tales. \n\n\nI'll start off with a little background: I work security for a Canadian company with a pretty good reputation. We've been known for years for awesome customer service, and so we often get cushy positions with the goverment. At the moment I work at a military facility (military wing of civie hospital), and my duties are minimal. We actually have a seperate company contracted to take care of bullshit we don't want to deal with. All things considered, my current post rocks.\n\n\n\nAt my post, I have two responsibilities:\n\n1. Stay awake while manning the desk\n\n2. Make sure nobody parks in the military section of parking\n\n\nNext to the main desk area is an outdoor parking lot with a row of military (DND) spots. These are for reduced mobility service members who should be allowed a shorter walk to the facility. On a couple of occasions there have been training accidents with reserve units nearby, and spots were needed that weren't available, so that's why we keep them clear at night. \n\n\n\nOn this particular night, I found myself enjoying a cancer stick in the DND parking. As I contemplated all my life's decisions, an early 2000s dodge caravan came rolling up and parked nearly on top of me across 2 DND spots. The driver resembled a female Jabba the Hutt, and her male counterpart was pretty much Ricky from Trailer Park Boys. As many of you fellow security peeps know, this was already a recipe for awful. As Jabba commenced a graceful descent from her steed, I regretfully engaged in conversation:\n\n\nMe: \"Excuse me miss, may I please see your DND Identification?\"\n\nJabba: \"What? Uhh, I'm not army.\"\n\nMe: \"Well you can't park here if you're not military, sorry.\"\n\nJabba: \"Aw come on, I'm here to see my mother! She's got *insert long story about mom*!\"\n\nMe: \"Sorry miss, rules are rules. You'll get ticketed and possibly towed if you're parked here.\"\n\n*Her man chimes in* : \"What the fuck man? Her mom's in the hospital, why you have to be such a dick?\"\n\nMe: \"Look bud, these spots are for injured military personnel. There's plenty of spots open to you all around here.\"\n\nJabba: \"Fuck that, I'm not moving now. Fucking ticket me if you want!\" \n\n\nAt this point they both made their way into the hospital, and I finished my now wasted smoke. I contacted the sub security guys, and they left a ticket on her van. I figured the situation was over, and for the next few hours it seemed as such. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFast forward to 6am, I was at my desk and the military section's doors unlocked. Almost immediately I heard footsteps and angry mutterings coming around the corner. Jabba had returned, and she was done no favors by being illuminated in sunlight. She ignored the big sign saying \"No Entry before 0715\" and began berrating me about the ticket:\n\n\nJabba: \"You spineless piece of shit. Who the hell do you think you are putting a goddam ticket on MY car?\"\n\nMe: \"Good morning miss. I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't use that language with me. I warned you about the policy for those parking spots, and you refused to move. You can appear at (insert local courthouse) to contest the ticket if you like.\"\n\nJabba: \"No fucking way! I want to speak to your supervisor!\"\n\nMe: \"Sorry miss, my supervisor does not come in until 0715, which is also when this section opens up. If you'd like to wait, there are benches just down the hall, and a timmies if you would like a drink.\"\n\nJabba: \"I'm waiting right here, thank you very much.\"\n\nMe: \"That's against policy miss. We don't even allow military personnel past that barrier (as I point to the barrier) until 0715.\"\n\nJabba: \"Well I'm not moving. If you fucking lay your hands on me, I swear I'll sue you!\"\n\nMe: \"I have no intention of having a physical altercation with you miss. However, if necessary, I will be forced to alert the Military Police, and they will be more than happy to come explain why you are not permitted to stay here while you wait.\"\n\n\nSuddenly, like a child, she crossed her arms and turned her back on me. She just stood there, refusing to listen for a good 10 minutes or so. Eventually I needed to go complete some paperwork, so the MPs were called. All I can say about the MPs is that I'm very thankful they have so little to do in the mornings, because they showed up in damn near 2 minutes. \n\n\nIn the end, she screamed, and yelled, and finally was detained when the MPs called in the local PD. Apparently she had a couple outstandings, and they wanted to talk to her. While it was a little too late, it was nice that she eventually wanted to just settle down and leave. Too bad she no longer had that option. So, I guess it's a lose-lose, because she did get arrested, but I had to write up a report about the whole thing. I fucking hate paperwork. \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\nTl;dr - Jabba came parkin', Jabba went cray. Jabba came callin', Jabba detained. ",

My job is to check tickets and issue fixed penalty fares to passengers who don't have tickets.\n\nIt was a quiet afternoon so the rush hour hadn't started yet. A woman in her mid 20's boarded the train and went into the 1st class carriage. She was sobbing on her phone and holding a roll of toilet paper. My duty is to ensure that all passengers have the correct ticket, and that passengers with standard class tickets aren't seated in the empty 1st class compartment. \n\nI walk over towards her with the intention of asking to see her ticket. She is facing towards the front of the train so she doesn't see me walking from the rear of the carriage. As I walk over to her, I heard her sobbing on the phone about \"Intensive Care Unit\" and the repeated phrase of \"I just wish I was there\". \n\nObviously this young woman is in a very distressed state. So I leave and give her some privacy. A few minutes later, she hangs up the phone and just starts crying uncontrollably. \n\nIt's not part of my job and certainly none of my business, but out of human compassion I ask her if she is OK. She is very polite and explains that her uncle has just died in hospital and she's on her way there now. I can only assume from the bits of the conversation I picked up on that he was probably in a terrible accident. \n\nI apologise for disturbing her, I tell her that I'm very sorry to hear of her loss and that I don't pretend to know what she is going through at the moment but if there's anything we (me and my colleague) can help her with, to let us know. \n\nShe seems grateful of this simple gesture and I leave the carriage.\n\nDid she have a ticket? I don't know. \n\nDid she have a 1st class ticket? Probably not. \n\nBut asking to see her ticket when she was obviously distressed from a family tragedy, especially if I had \"followed the rules\" and issued a penalty fare to her for not having a ticket would have been a catalyst which would have made one of the worst days of her life 10 times worse and she would probably never have wanted to travel on a train ever again.\n\n\nYes, I could have been a jobsworth and done my job to the book, or I could have been human for just a few minutes to avoid making a terrible day for somebody even worse.",

This joint is a busy one, but relatively little to no trouble as it's a niche crowd. Unfortunately as it's the latest licence in the area, we do get an influx of people around 3am that we have to screen for entry as near all of them are not our core clientele. Some of them do slip through, and as such the last half of the shift is invariably dealing with these people that don't abide by a strict patron code of conduct thinking it's a normal nightclub. \n\nAnyway, the owner calls me up to the CCTV room (he's a pretty hands on bloke like me) and points to one of the screens. Clearly seen is some damn hipster leaning over a closed bar and helping himself to a tap beer about 10 minutes ago, whilst his girlfriend watched him laughing. He was wearing a pretty distinctive jumper, as such was easily spotted in another area. So my enforcer and I go for a chat. \n\nRoll up on the hipster, tell him he is to leave immediately. He's cool with it, as he was well into his cups and stoned outta his head 'But I've only had three beers' (side note; *never* say this to a Bouncer. Three beers is always the default number people go to when they are lying about their intake) but asks why anyway. We inform him about his theft, he starts denying it. I pull my phone up, show him the recording I had made off the screen upstairs so he promptly shuts his mouth. \n\nNow to the revenge part. \n\nHe dug his heels in at the door, so we had to re-educate him on how to move forward. He's kicking a stink up when a devious little thought popped up. Me in Italics, him in quotes; \n\n*'Mate, do you or have you ever worked in a bar?'*\n\n'Thats none of your business.'\n\n*'True, but it's relevant for my next question; do you know what Tap-line cleaner is?'*\n\n'...What?'\n\n*'The reason that bar was closed is because we were running a chemical through the lines to clean them. They were hooked back up to the beer afterwards, but weren't flushed clean. That beer you poured was probably at least 1/3 Glycol, or 1/10 Hydrogen Peroxide depending on which line they are cleaning. Do you know what that does to your body mate?'* \n\n'No...' (His GF is paying real close attention now instead of harping on at my doorman) \n\n*'Well it'll start shutting down your Renal System as it starts fucking you up internally, making it seem like you are getting really drunk real quick cos your system is fighting the poison instead of processing and breaking down the alcohol. It's not pleasant to experience in say, 4 hours or so as you essentially just drank a toxic substance. I would recommend going to the hospital, right now.'* (fun fact; Alcohol is a toxin as well, hence why the term 'Intoxicated' is used when under it's influence) \n\n'...You're full of it.' (Not by the drunken fear in you and your gf's eyes matey) \n\nI shrug. *'Think what you want mate, although,'* I look over to his gf, *'do you really want to risk it? Again, get to a hospital. I'll call an ambulance if you like.'*\n\nI turn to walk back inside, my doorman plays along. \n\n'You want me to make the call for em Guv, or leave it to them?' \n\nI turn and look at em. *'Probably should call 000, he's already starting to look a bit off.'*\n\nWell the gf starts panicking as I walk through the door. Second I'm through, I race back up to the Control Room, let the owner know what's happening. Quick check on the radio to ensure all posts are covered in my absence whilst he tees up the front door cameras.\n\nCameras up; the guy is across the road, making himself vomit. Gf is crying, on the phone. They both jump in a cab a few minutes later, speed off in the same direction as a nearby hospital. \n\nThis was all at around 4am on a Saturday morning. Anyone who works in a hospital knows that because of this, they would be in the Waiting Room for a *long* time before being seen.\n\n Enjoy the rest of your night, you thieving douchebag hipsters.",

We work a lot of Section 8 properties and deal with a lot of crap, make frequent detentions for felonies, and for our safety. I've been threatened death, Assaulted, even shot at one night. I've had to pull my duty weapon more times than i'd have liked to, I have lots of stories. All names are changed from real events.)\n\nA few weeks back a co worker and myself were doing a foot patrol of a section 8 housing project and we had heard a fire alarm going off in one of our three floored apartment buildings. (Fire alarms are quite common and its usual a group of people clam baking some weed or k2, or someone burning food.)\n\nwe had found the alarm coming from unit B2 and we knocked, no answer. We knocked some more, no answer. We could smell food cooking and initially suspected some burning food. We went outside of the building to see if we could see anything from the patio sliding glass doors. Smoke was billowing out of the back windows and doorway. \nAdrenaline went up 150% My partner called it in to the fire department and i sprint back to the front door. I'm a stocky guy and i figured my weight and running at full force into the door would bust the latch. (Sound logic in the heat of the moment, but i remembered that this isn't a movie and we are in the middle of the ghetto and all of these doors are steel and reinforced to attempt to keep thugs from beating them in.) So i ran at that door at full speed with my shoulder, and my momentum whiplashed my neck forward and i straight up headbutt the steel door. Completely rung my bell and i was officially dazed for about 20 seconds. I then start the slow process of kicking in a steel door. \n\nI'm shorter so it was hard for me to reach and aim for the deadbolt of the door, it was taking too much time. After getting off the phone my partner joined me  after pulling the buildings fire alarm. The two of us kicked the door one after another and it finally gave in. We got hit by a plume of smoke, and i did something incredibly stupid. I went inside.\n\n The smoke was really thick and dark and i could barely see. I went from room to room looking for any people or pets, nothing in the two bedrooms, and nothing in the living room. It was getting incredibly hard to breathe even at a crouched position and i made my way to the kitchen, the stovetop and the wall behind it, and the cabinets above were completely engulfed with flames. \n\nI Ran back out to the hallway and found a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall and tried to rip it off, it wouldn't budge, my head was going a mile a minute and i couldn't register why it wouldn't come off it's mount. the bottom clasp was still attached, i had just enough time to call myself an idiot before i unclasped it and went back inside. I pulled the pin and started spraying the wall and cabinets and the stove it self. I was coughing pretty badly at this point and i could barely keep my eyes open, i remember the fire was almost trolling me at one point, the fire was out for a split second, then whoosh, came right back up. this happened three or four times before the extinguisher ran out, luckily i managed to put it out.\n\nI ran back outside to my partner looking at me like i was a crazy person and the fire department pulling up. I was hacking up a lung and got offered some oxygen, but i wasn't dying or anything. Fire department gutted the kitchen and estimated the fire did about $2000 dollars in damages. The apartment owner had left food cooking on the stove while they left to go to the store.\nSo i saved a building. That's my story for the day. \n\nwhile taking photos of the damages my co worker snuck a photo of me looking confused as hell. http://imgur.com/9RVXLYS\n\n\n",

        "text": "I've done 3 shifts now. On my first shift, I arrived at the site, and was informed via telephone half an hour into my shift that I'm supposed to call in on arrival (and not just sign staff books). That information would have been far more useful *before* starting the shift. That's when I decided the management at my company was subpar.\n\nHowever, it pales in comparison to the actual site I work at. I have never seen such ineptitude in my life. It's night reception work, so there's very little to actually do. Watch CCTV, go on patrols, man the phones, weigh down the chairs, and keep the residents in line (it's basically a youth hostel).\n\nTheoretically (and as my situation proves), one person is capable of doing that, provided there's someone you can call out to grab reception while you do other security things, which there is. However, at best, that should be an uncommon, emergency scenario. There is CCTV, so by my reckoning, there should be one CCTV trained security officer on site at all times. I'm licensed to operate CCTV, but I have not had any on-site training for their systems, nor do I have admin access to the system to be able to switch cameras or review footage. I also believe a second security officer should be on site at all times. If anything happens, two is better than one, and also, written logs from two separate sources are going to provide a more reliable sequence of events if there is ever an altercation between a security officer and someone else.\n\nAlso, someone in charge of the site, and their own day-to-day activities, should be readily accessible at any time.\n\nLast night was an interesting one. I got some reports of something kicking off in one of the rooms, so I called someone out from the back office (separate company, not security-related, and unaffiliated with the site's management) to man reception while I went to check things out. Arrived at the room, and called through the door, and was responded to with 'we're ok, go away' (not what was said, but I'm trying to keep things vague for reasons). I returned to my reception desk.\n\nLater, reports came in about a flood. Again, I called someone out to hold reception while I went to investigate. Sure enough, the room had water coming from the light fixtures. I used my common sense and decided there was no way I would let anyone sleep in that room, given the scale of the problem. I had to get hold of the management somehow. Went back to my post, dug around for information, found an on-call management service. Called them up and found out they were 200 miles away and **had no record of the building in their systems**. Through the resultant 45 minutes on the phone, I got permission to investigate the room above the incident, where someone had left water running all over the room, so I turned it off. This was when the manager from afar decided to end the conversation, until I reminded them that the room was unsafe for the resident... none of this part is my job, now.. I'm getting into tenant placement and well... running their business. If there had been anyone either on-site or local on call, I could have summoned them in and got on with doing my own job. Eventually, the resident went off-site, even though that meant breaking the terms of police tagging, but fuck it. Not my problem. I wasn't going to let them back into a room that was completely drenched and therefore full of extra safety risks (that I can't assess from outside the room, and won't be risking my job entering someone's private space to assess). Meanwhile all the leaking water has triggered a fault in the fire alarm systems, for which there are conveniently no instructions around for shutting up. Cue constant buzzing for the next 8 hours.\n\n10 minutes peace after all this, and then a phone call from another room. The first room where things were kicking off before are at it again, and have woken up all the others around them. I decided that since I'm only going to get the same response as before (and the previous night) if I go up, I would just get police in to eject the guest, and put an end to the nightly disturbances. They came, they did it, and then 2 hours later that guest returned and simply brute forced the main security door open (which I later showed police was as easy as getting a grip on the door and pulling). The police wanted to see CCTV footage...\n\n'Sorry, but as the only CCTV officer on site, I an completely unable to access the CCTV to show you what happened'. (yes, I felt like a complete fool).\n\nNeedless to say, my handover to the day staff (employed by the company that runs the site) a number of hours later contained quite a few choice words about just how secure and safe the site is when the lone security guard cannot effectively do any security guarding, and instead has to do everyone else's jobs. FWIW, the people I spoke to were sympathetic, but even if they weren't they couldn't exactly fire me. I hear their manager, who is the only one likely to be able to talk to my company's management, basically doesn't care (which I can believe considering how well managed the place isn't), and the only other guy from my company contracted there has been universally described as impossible to hold a conversation with, consistently unreasonable, and quite probably would manage to cause a fight between two heavily sedated, stoned pacifists. Needless to say, they prefer having me there, even if I do care enough to get snarky about safety, over having him there.\n\nEDIT: I actually got to meet the other guy from my company yesterday morning. After 14 and a half hours on shift, I was about ready to go home. There were two of us on that shift (apparently weekends are busier, and require 2 people, but now I have the experience that says otherwise... or just had a bad couple of weekdays), and the other guy from my company came to relieve us both... half an hour late. The guy who's worked there 3 years took charge doing handover, and I felt it would be the proper thing to do to stay until handover was complete. However, halfway through handover, the other guy from my company, in his broken English, half-shouted at me 'why you here? go home, go home!' in the tone you would use to shoo a stray dog. I think I understand why he's not well liked, now.",

When I give her the \"I hope you die\" look, she acts like I'm being some uptight asshole. No, I just don't enjoy being groped by strange drunk chicks.\n\nNow, I'm married - so I don't look for hookups on the job. I know a lot of bouncers out there do.

        "text": "I work as a Revenue Protection Officer (\"Ticket Inspector\") on a busy train network. My job role involves ensuring passengers pay the correct fare for their journey and issue Penalty Fares to those who don't.\n\nI'm checking one of the last trains to leave the station in the evening. I check about 40 tickets in the standard class carriage before I check tickets in the 1st Class compartment.\n\nThere's about 6 or 7 people in there and after checking all their tickets, one smartly dressed guy in an expensive looking suit and, what looked like a Rolex on his wrist, slowly hands me his standard class yearly ticket. I explain to him that as he is sitting in the 1st Class compartment with a standard ticket, I will be issuing him with a penalty fare. I explain to him how much it is and ask how he wishes to pay. \n\nHe then slowly, and almost drunkenly, pulls out his wallet containing about 10 different credit cards and gives me an American Express card in the name of \"Mr Smith\" before he puts his wallet very slowly back into his jacket pocket. \n\nI explain that we don't take American Express, and ask if he has a VISA or Mastercard. He pauses before telling me that's all he has. I have just seen at least half a dozen other cards in his wallet - most of which would have been VISA or Mastercard, but I'm not in the mood for arguing with him. \n\nI hand his American Express card back to him and ask for him to provide his name and address, explaining that he will have to pay it at a later date. I ask him to write his name and address on my notepad.\n\nI still have his yearly train ticket in my other hand, which has a photo card with the same serial number on it. Let's say the name on it was \"Smith\"...\n\nHe slowly scrawls some details onto my notepad with great difficulty. As he hands the notepad back, the name he has written down is \"Jones\".\n\n\"Is your name *really* Jones?\" I ask him, as he hasn't noticed I've got his photo card in my other hand which clearly has the name \"Smith\" on it.\n\n\"Yeah....... Why?\" He replies in a slurred voice.\n\n\"Well you are in possession of a yearly ticket in the name of Smith. Why would that be?\" - Bearing in mind that lending a yearly ticket to a friend, or using a lost or stolen ticket is against the law!\n\nHis eyes become wide open and he slowly reaches forward and tries to grab the yearly ticket from my other hand. I'm quick to see this so I step back, preventing him from doing so.\n\n\"No..... It's not my name..... lemme write down my name again....\"\n\nThis time he gets halfway through writing down an equally illegible name and address before he asks how much the it (the penalty fare) is. \n\nI tell him exactly how much he needs to pay, so he reaches into his wallet and pulls out two £20 notes which tend to have a tendency to roll up on themselves, as if they'd been used to \"consume\" certain illegal substances.\n\nI issue him with the penalty fare and give him his change before I  start to tell him all the legal jargon I am required to explain.\n\nAs I hand it to him, he starts complaining that he's being victimized and claims that I haven't checked the other passengers tickets. I correct him on these accusations, but I think he was just too drugged up to notice I had checked the other passengers first.\n\nTLDR - Drugged-up city boy sits in 1st class without the correct ticket, then gives a false name without realizing his real name is on his yearly ticket, then pays with two banknotes which he'd previously used to \"Consume\" illegal substances.",

The girls with the later shifts have to deal with parking further away from the building than their morning counterparts. It's not even that bad right now, the building isn't at full capacity! But there is one girl... \n\nShe is 19. I'll call her Tara. Unbeknownst to me, she had been parking in a space reserved for one of two employees for one of the various companies housed here. Neither of them ever came to me, and there's no parking pass for it - they just have to report it if someone who isn't them is parked there. \n\nOne day, I get an email from Tara - \"Hey did you put a note on my car telling me I would be towed if I kept parking there?\" No, that definitely wasn't me. The note was unofficial, taped sloppily to her windshield. She was pissed because \"the tape ruined the windshield\". So I went downstairs to chat with her. I told her \"Nope, we have official parking violation notes for that kind of stuff. But all things considered, you're lucky that you just had a note taped to your car. If they had followed proper protocol and reported it to me, I would have had your car towed before you shift ended.\" She responded with something along the lines of \"I know, totally my fault for parking there, but this was really unnecessary and I want you to check the cameras and find out who did it. They need to fix my windshield and they had no right to threaten to have me towed\" yeah alright you're wrong but whatever. Check the cameras. Turns out the space is in a blind spot. But, I know who it was - there are literally only two people it could have been. \n\nShe knows the name of the company, just not that it's so few people, and begins to pester me about telling her the names of the employees (while I'm on my lunch break in the cafeteria!). No, no, and no. She got pretty pissy and eventually exclaimed \"We're here together every day! I thought we were friends!\" At this point I had to shut everything down on her. \"My job requires me to be friendly, but to also keep everyone at a distance. We're not friends. This is my job. I'm not gonna give you the names of these folks so you can harass them. If you have a problem with that, you can take it to management.\" \n\nShe did not take it to management. She has also not spoken to me in a week, and is switching to a different building soon. I'm relieved. \n\nFinal note: I've had stuff taped to my windshield before with no damage. Unless they put superglue on the tape, I don't believe her claims.",

        "text": "Howdy guys! I'm sorry I haven't posted in a few months, been super busy. Let me take you back to a simpler time. The good old last key round before graveyard shift comes in.\n\n So, as most of you who have read my stories know, I worked in a Mall back in the day. We used to close down at 18:00 on Sunday, which obviously left a few hours before 22:00, which was the end of swing shift. We used to do door check and electronic tour watch between 19:00 and 22:00. To those of you who don't know what this is, it's the same as walking rounds! With an annoying beeping blue pipe! \n\nAnyway we do the mall interior and after we would go do an ETW in the six story building, and other stores and stuff on the property. So this six story building we had on the property was usually the last stop for our shift.\n\n Multiple officers have reported that building was haunted. Even our Assistant Director, who did multiple tours with the Marine Corps, and who I swear literally wasn't afraid of anything, said that the damn place was haunted. \"The Haunting\" as I'll call it, consisted of several odd occurrances.\n\n One of the FTO's swears to this day, that something said her name and blew her hair back. Ok sure, but I'll go ahead and chock it up to exhaustion from school and family stuff. You know those engineering majors, always kinda crazy and exhausted at the same time. Such a great combination! Our ADR said that something told him to get out of the building. Alright I'm interested, so now it can talk! At first I just thought he was screwing with me, because he has a fucked up sense of humor! \n\nNumerous other officers and supervisors had preached about how it was haunted, and I kept thinking one thing.\n\n Bullshit it is! \n\nI've been in that building dozens of times, morning, noon, and night. I'd never seen a thing wrong with it. So, one beautiful Sunday night in the fall of last year, I strapped up, and headed to do my watch in the haunted house. First thing I noticed, because for whatever reason I was extra attentive that night, (Shocking I know) was that a light was on inside the roof access. Alright, Engineering must have left the light on. Checked the access log, not a thing, all fricken weekend. Immediately I think, \n\n\"Great so someone got upstairs!\"\n\n I sigh thinking, great another report I have to do before end of shift, and head into the access area, and start looking around. The room is about 12x24, with long pipes going down to the left, a door to the right into building stuff, a door in front directly to the roof, and a door you have to climb up a ladder to look inside of. Just keep that model in mind for a quick second, I promise it's relevant.\n\n So I do my security thing and start looking around going in and out of doors. I get to the ladder door, (Hate that door) and climb up and look inside. Alright, nothing whatever time to move on.\n\n In that split second, I think my mind was thinking about what I was gonna say to that cute blonde girl I'm so stuck on and like so much after shift, because immediately after I had that thought, I didn't stand a chance. \n\n All of the sudden it sounded like someone (The Hulk probably, it was that loud) punched the wall next to my head. This obviously startled me. By startled me, I mean I fell off the ladder and hauled ass outside of that building. I say startled because it makes me sound like less of a bitch.\n\n So I called my partner and told her I was done doing checks, and coming back to the office, and that I just got haunted. So I get back, (White as a ghost, I know that was bad, shut up .) and tell her the story, and she's like obviously you got haunted S-16.\n\n Well word quickly spread around. S-5 and S-8 obviously used this opportunity to make fun of me the next day. Oh but it didn't stop there! My own little Amityville Horror Story spread to our ADR. Well I'm sitting Dispatch and he comes in smiling (I just know I'm about to catch hell). The exchange went a little like this. \n\n\"So I heard you had an experience with a ghost in the six story.\" \n\n\"I did, it was terrifying.\"\n\n\"Alright so we're gonna give it a call sign for the radio list, you know just in case it ever wants to talk to you. It's now Ecto-1.\"\n\n\"Shut the hell up, I almost died!\"\n\n(Laughing)\n\nWell that was just the start, that damned call sign has followed me around ever since. I just hope that Ecto-1 decides not to take another roving patrol while I do my checks again. \n\nThanks for reading guys, I'll try to post more frequently now, I have a whole new wealth of stories, ghost related and non ghost related!",

She doesn't recognize me but she's talking to everyone about how she used to come here all the time and compete often, and how awesome the old staff were.. bla bla bla... Then she just disappears.\n\nAbout ten minutes later one of our Gogo girls (they dance in cages while dancers aren't on stage to keep the mood going) comes up to the front door and this conversation ensues:\n\n&gt;Gogo: Uh, Trystanik you might want to run down into the bathroom. There's two girls in one stall. I think they're doing drugs.\n\n*I'm PUMPED to finally do something because the guys always handle shit without me(I know I'm not security, but I've got the security license so if shit goes down with the ladies, they don't need to worry about getting sued n'stuff). So I run out of the back and run downstairs*\n\n&gt;T: I'm on it!\n\n&gt;Gogo: Yeah Bouncer, you miiiiight want to go with her.\n\nWe get to the bathroom and *FOOT CHECK*. Yep! There's 2 girls in one stall. So I just stand there and wait.\n\nThey open the door.\n\n&gt;T: Sooo, Whatcha dooooing in there? *I try kinda humorously peer over their shoulder* Having a...\"party\"? A party with coke?\n\n&gt;NotCokehead: We were going pee.\n\n&gt;T: Yep. Suuuure you were. There's no need to double up in the bathroom because the other 5 stalls were empty so I'm not buying it. You're night's over. Let's go.\n\n&gt;NotCokehead: But I said I wasn't doing anything! I was going pee.\n\n&gt;T: And I said your night is over. Case closed. Let's go.\n\n&gt;Notcokehead: This is so unfair. I didn't doooo anything! I don't even have any coke! I don't do it. I swear! *take note that at this time, the girl that she was with totally understood and was just glad that they were leaving*\n\n&gt;Bouncer: Listen, you have to see it from our point of view. We had someone come up to us and say that we had 2 girls in a stall doing drugs. Now, when we came down and DID see 2 girls in one stall, that's the first thing that comes to mind. You've been here before. You know this. You know the rules. We aren't changing our minds. Let's go.\n\nShe ends up getting to the front door then REFUSES to move. Calls for the manager. (At this point she has drawn a crowd and all the bouncers are paying attention.) But the manager finally comes down.\n\nMgr: How can I help you? What's the problem?\n\nNotacokehead: I wasn't doing anything... blablalblalblalbla coke bla bla bla bla bla Peeing bla bla bla bla *Obviously edited because we DGAF at this point.*\n\nMgr: Okay. I understand, but as my staff have explained to you, the situation was pretty clear as to what was happening and I'm agreeing with them on this one. Unfortunately you're going to have to leave. We can get you cab vouchers to get you home, but your night here is done.\n\nAt this point we start turning her and directing her to the door and she just goes nuts. Screaming, Flailing and the works. Doorguys get me out of the way and start DRAGGING her out to the door.\n\nNotacokehead: Let me GO! I'll walk out MYSELF!\n\nSo we let her go. She almost falls over and trudges out the door.\n\nThe friend that was in the stall with her apologizes and is completely understanding of our rules and is incredibly compliant. Then she drops this one on us:\n\nFriend: You see, I really wanted to go and NotaCokehead didn't want to leave so I got her to do coke in the bathroom because I knew you'd find out and make us leave.\n\n**LOLWHAT**\n\nOnce they both leave the bar, the bouncers come back into the bar and they literally look like they just dusted the bar with their vests. One guess what was on them?\n\nBouncer: So uh, I think I accidentally just did cocaine. I feel kinda funny. (I'm pretty sure that he was just saying that for the LOLS.. At least I'm hoping so. Haha)\n\n**Oh!** The reason why I remembered the girl from before is because she tried on numerous occasions to try and get one of the bouncers to sleep with her and went so far as to stalk him on social media and stuff.\n\n\n**TL;DR: Girl doesn't do cocaine. Actually does it. Apparently that was the plan all along.**",

        "text": "9:15 am and I had just cracked open my Double Shot canned goodness and\nsat down in my office chair. The computer whirred to life after being\nin sleep mode all night. As I cast my glance between the different\ncamera views, I notice some activity in the Liquor department. I\ndouble click for full screen, and wouldn't you know it? These 2 guys\nlook barely old enough to shave, let alone be in the liquor section by\nthemselves. I reluctantly push off and head down stairs to put eyes on\nthem. Right as I get to the end of the Aisle, Suspect 1 performs a\nmagic trick and makes a bottle of vodka disappear to the inside pocket\nof his jacket. As I look to his companion, another feat of mystery, as\nhis bottle magically ends up down the front of his pants. I feel my\nheart start pounding. Now, I just have to wait for them to leave\nwithout them seeing me. But they jump on their phones and start\ntalking to an unknown person at the other end. They don't know that\nthey're really distracting themselves. Subject 1 goes to the opposite\nend of the store to exit. I end up making it out the door first, and\nwait 10 seconds for him to smell the fresh air.\n\nAs soon as his foot landed past the door threshold, I turn and show\nhim my badge. \"Hey man, let's go inside and talk about that booze in\nyour jacket.\" He's dumbfounded. I put my hand on his jacket,\nunderneath his right arm to help guide him back. \"Hey you can't touch\nme! He's recording you!\" I felt the slight tug of desperation, as he\ntried to turn his hips to run the opposite way. I grabbed the front of\nhis jacket, and pushed him inside further, advising him that running\nwould be bad choice. As we entered back into the store, I see Subject\n2 in fornt of the exit door, wide eyed. He didn't know his buddy had\nbeen caught. He turned and promptly headed to Aisle 3 in an attempt to\nhide. But I saw him, and yelled for a manager to grab him.\n\nSubject 1 began to cry as I started paperwork. As I requested ID from\nboth subjects, Subject 2 decided he wanted to play mini gangster, get\nout of his chair and get in my face. I have no tolerance or patience\nfor people acting tough. I grabbed his wrist, put him on the ground\nand handcuffed. \"Hey man, I didn't do nothing! What the fuck, bro?\"\n\"That was when I informed him of his imminent arrest. I don't think\nI've seen such a transistion from hard ass to blubbering baby happen\nso fast.\n\nBoth subjects lied about their age and identity to myself, and the\npolice which is a Felony in my state. About an hour and a half later,\nthe arresting officer called and informed me about the falsification\nof identification.  Subject 1 was actually 18, and has about 2\nprevious arrests from my location. Subject 2 was 17, and was found to\nhave an outstanding warrant for Grand Theft Auto. All in all, it was a\ngood day.",
