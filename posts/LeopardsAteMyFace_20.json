        "text": "Recently, we’ve seen a marked uptick in posts that are not leopards eating faces. Just because someone is experiencing consequences doesn’t mean that the Panthera pardus is dining on a face. \n#We’re aiming for quality over quantity here, and in order for something to be suitable for this subreddit ***all*** the boxes have to be ticked:\n\n-\tSomeone is suffering consequences\n-\tSomeone has a sad over the consequences\n-\tThe consequences are something they voted for/supported *and* the consequences are something they wanted to impose on someone else\n-\tThe leopards are doing the dining\n\n*******************\n\nWhat isn't Leopards Eating Faces? Some examples include (but not limited to):\n\n-\t[**Twitter post claiming Tesla is recalling every single car from fake Elon Musk account starts chaos**]( https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/twitter-elon-musk-fake-account-tesla-recall-ethan-klein-b2250036.html?.tsrc=applewf) …This is consequences, but you’ll notice the other 3 criteria aren’t being met. Musk isn’t sad, this isn’t something he voted for or supported, this isn’t something he wanted to impose on anyone else, and the leopards aren’t eating his face.\n\n\n\n-\t[**Trump-Pardoned Criminals in Trouble for More Crimes**](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/US/trump-era-pardon-recipients-increasingly-back-legal-jeopardy/story?id=95568587) ...They are suffering consequences and while there’s no evidence of it, they’re probably dealing with a case of the sads. But this isn’t something they for or supported, this isn’t something they wanted to impose on anyone else, and the leopards aren’t eating their faces.\n\n\n-\t[**Tennessee lawmakers have some regrets about rushing a new law holding back 3rd graders who struggle to read**](https://wpln.org/post/tennessee-lawmakers-have-some-regrets-about-rushing-a-new-law-holding-back-3rd-graders-who-struggle-to-read/) ...They’re not really suffering consequences, and while they do have a case of the sads, and this is something they voted for, this isn’t something they wanted to happen to someone else, and the leopards aren’t eating the faces.\n\n\n-\t[**Russian oligarch who criticised Ukraine war has $1bn hotel complex seized**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/12/20/russian-oligarch-oleg-deripaska-who-criticised-ukraine-war-has/) ….He’s sad, and he’s got consequences. But he didn’t support the war, and members of his own party (aka the Leopards) aren’t eating his face. \n\n\nSo what are some good examples? [I never thought they’d deport *my* undocumented immigrant husband!](https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/05/us/undocumented-husband-deported/index.html) says women who voted for the man who said he’d do that very thing. [I’m living paycheck-to-paycheck!](https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/zqmu7j/and_republicans_still_support_them/).... Cries the man who voted for the “bootstrap it, asshole” party. [Why are you refusing me service, this is unacceptable!](https://old.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/kttdp5/how_dare_a_private_company_refuse_service_to/) ….says the woman who voted to ensure that businesses could refuse service to whomever they want, and who’s pissed that it’s not just the LGBTQIA+ community that’s getting the short end of the stick.\n\nWe’d ask that you report wherever you see something that doesn’t tick all the boxes to report it. We may not get to it immediately, since we have lives and shit, but we will action it.  If we remove your post, don’t take it personally- it’s just not a good fit. (Good news is you get to keep all the karma you earned, so there’s that!) If you have any questions, please feel free to shoot us a modmail, and we’ll get back to you.\n\nCheers and Happy Holidays!",
