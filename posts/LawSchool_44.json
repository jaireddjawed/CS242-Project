        "text": "Hi all, \n\nAs a current undergraduate and prospective law student, I‚Äôm wondering how heavy the 1L workload is at a T14? \n\nI‚Äôve been described as an ‚Äúintense‚Äù student and am perpetually busy/stressed. I keep a 4.0, usually take 16-18 credit hours, and last semester had two different internships (not doing that again though, that was wild). I‚Äôm also a research assistant, and I am the co-chair of one campus org and the founder and exec chair of another. I also commute an hour each way to campus.\n\nI have a lot going on, but I‚Äôm at a fairly uncompetitive, low-stress state school (because free) and have relatively ‚Äúeasy‚Äù majors (double majoring in poli sci and international affairs and minoring in French and PACS). Often, I‚Äôll just listen to my readings (speechify saves lives) and be fine for the lecture, and maybe scan them once before an exam/assignment. I sometimes feel like I put less effort into school than I do my internships/extracurriculars. For law school, though, I have my sights set on a T14.\n\nMy question is ‚Äî will it be that much of an adjustment, workload wise, going into my 1L? I often hear horror stories about the stress/workload of law school, but I also feel like I‚Äôm doing a lot more than most of my peers. I‚Äôm wondering if it will be somewhat similar to my current workload, or if I‚Äôm in for a rude awakening? Knowing me, I‚Äôll prob want to get involved in law review and/or student gov, and aim to be towards the top of my class, too.    \n\nI‚Äôm just trying to get a better sense of what 1L life is like from my T14 redditors. I have a partner who has expressed interest in moving with me, but don‚Äôt want to make him uproot his life if I‚Äôm going to be a stressed asshole that never comes out of my room.\n\n***if it makes a difference, I am an older undergrad with some professional/life experience.

        "text": "Based on the grades I've received thus far, it's looking like I'm going to be just above median (above a 3.3) at my T25 school (University of Minnesota). This could change if my remaining exams turn out drastically different from expectations (hasn't been the case so far), but this looks to be the most likely outcome.\n\nIn order to be competitive at OCI/guarantee 250+ attorney summer offers (want to make money, at least to start), most upper level students have recommended that you finish at least in the top third. While I obviously have one semester to go, I'd like to hear stories from attorneys / upper level students who didn't have the grades for OCI and still landed similarly lucrative employment offers upon graduation. I know it's not as common, but I'd like to get an idea of how difficult it's going to be if my grades aren't what I want them to be after 1L.\n\nAny advice? Encouraging success stories? Sites I can visit to find some? Statistics on how many \"make it\" without top 1L grades? Figures on how much longer it takes to achieve the same salary?\n\nAlso - if you start midlaw, and then transition to a big firm 2-3 years in, do you start at first year pay levels again or are those years taken into account, at least somewhat? Asking for a friend.",

        "text": "So I graduate this May. I have a 3.8 GPA and an LSAT score of 159. I have only taken the LSAT once and did very minimal studying. I have always wanted to attend the top 20 law schools, but with my current scores do not allow me to enter into them. I was registered for the November LSAT, but due to the class load, I ended up canceling it all together, and now I can‚Äôt retake the LSAT again for a better score to use for any applications this cycle. I‚Äôm worried about applying to my local schools in Texas because it would feel as though I‚Äôm ‚Äúsettling,‚Äù and I hate knowing that I didn‚Äôt truly put my best foot forward by giving my LSAT enough preparation. I also don‚Äôt love the idea of waiting a full year before I can move forward with a career in law school. I have no work experience and wouldn‚Äôt know how to begin or how to find internships or work experience if I was to take a ‚Äúgap year.‚Äù I am a second-generation college student in my family, and I have no lawyers or anyone to turn to for advice. I‚Äôve registered for the February LSAT; however, these results won‚Äôt come back until March 1st, which is the deadline for many tier 2 schools. I‚Äôd also only be giving myself a month to prepare for the LSAT. I‚Äôm just not sure what I should be doing or if I‚Äôm rushing into a mistake, and I don‚Äôt want to make a decision I‚Äôll regret later. Does anyone have any advice on what I should be doing?",
