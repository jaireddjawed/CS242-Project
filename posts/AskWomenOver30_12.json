        "text": "I am probably not a great son. I'm not terrible either, but I know I am not doing my best.\n\nI have definitely fallen into the '[You should have asked](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/)' category male. This comic really lays bare the negative dynamic between my mother and I.\n\nMy mom is smart, well-educated (PhD), raised three boys on her own (father left when his kids were 9, 7--me--and 2), and is active with her church, and has her own hobby &amp; activity set.\n\nI have COPD &amp; asthma, and the equivalent lung capacity of an 80 year-old based on my height &amp; weight, even when healthy. I have been sick my entire life (100+ lung infections just in the past 23 years), probably spending 2+ years cumulatively in various hospitals with severe lung infections (bronchitis, pneumonia). I am permanently disabled, and there has never been a time in my life in which someone could have said, \"healthy-looking guy right here\". Both of my bothers are 6', 180#, married, with stable careers. My older brother has two kids.\n\nCompared to my brothers, I definitely feel like a loser--What have I accomplished?--and this causes depression, which makes to hard to see the point in doing anything. I have been in therapy for my depression, and want to resume it when I get back home.\n\nBack when I was 25 and first went to work in Alaska for the summer (2006), I think I saw myself as having a shot like any other young guy at having a normal work life. Looking back, 16 years and several dozen lung infections later, that was never realistic. Being chronically sick prevented me from having a career, which I think is partially responsible for stunting some of my opportunities for maturity (lack of money caused a lack of independent housing, lack of housing caused an inability to have a LTR, no LTR no kids, etc).\n\nNo woman would have wanted to have had kids with my bad genetics. I haven't had a GF in 12 years. I don't doubt I am emotionally stunted--probably some sort of attachment disorder, but I don't know enough about them to know which. It's hard to admit this. Certainly this something I will need to discuss with my therapist.\n\nWhen I am sick, I am virtually incapacitated, given that my lung inflammation causes me to be a 'mucus volcano' where I cough all day, for a good 2-3 weeks until I return to normal. I am coughing every 2-5 minutes, or taking a nebulizer all day, so it isn't practical for me to hang up the laundry, or try to sweep the floor, etc. Often, making it up the stairs causes 5 minutes of coughing just to return a desperate wheeze.\n\nWhen I am sick, I do a good job at NOT asking my mom for too much. I am always telling her not to worry, \"Nope, I'm fine.\" I don't ask for food, or for her to go shopping for me, etc.\n\nBut, being sick has definitely caused me a certain 'learned helplessness'. When I am sick, I just read books, and watch movies / TV on my computer. When I am healthy... I do the same thing when I am not working.\n\nWhen my mom was forced to retire by her school district, she bought a small farmstead. I moved in about 18 months later, and have been living a home for the past 5-ish years (Spring 2018 - Fall 2022).\n\nBecause we have a bit of land, I accidentally ended up with a poultry farm--if you know anything about 'chicken math' this will make sense to you.\n\nI ran my poultry business successfully for five years until Fall 2022 when I sold off my birds, and went overseas. I worked everyday for five years with no appreciable time off, so I figured it was okay to take a break, and get away from myself, my patterns, and ruts / habits for a while.\n\nI have been overseas for the past four months, and am headed home in 10 days. I saw it as a way to give my mom a break from me, but there was definitely an element of, \"Instead of dealing with my problems, I'll just run away from myself.\"\n\nAs the above comic explains, I think my biggest flaw is just not seeing, or semi-purposefully ignoring the housework--washing dishes, making dinner, doing laundry, etc. I do these chores sometimes, but definitely not enough of the time.\n\nWhen I get back home, I am going to make a concerted effort to do more housework. I am also going to share this self-realization, and apologize for not being better, for arguing too much--\"You should have asked!\" Ugh, geezus. I get it now. How terribly obtuse men are--how terribly obtuse I am. I am just a faceless text box here, but I apologize to everyone.\n\nWhat ELSE can I do for my mom?\n\nAll comments welcome. I would value any insight or advice this community is willing to share.",

And to an extent, it did. He was still my best friend, but due to time differences and the difficulties of distance, we weren’t able to be all that in touch. After my course, I went back to my hometown. For a number of reasons, we didn’t hang out all that much, and I was actively trying to stay away in order to get over him. Some of his opinions about me at this time also did not sit well with me (for eg, when I confessed that I felt badly about not having a dating life, he said I would not be able to have one until I lost weight, can be seen as unattractive because ‘men will always be men’ and should work harder on becoming fitter). So I distanced myself from him.  \n\nHowever, over the last 1.5 years, our friendship was rekindled after we took a trip with mutual friends, and it was back to being best friends, like the last 4 years never happened. We got very close, and unfortunately I realised we had both matured, and I fell even harder this time. I was in way over my head.  Now, I’ve moved cities again, but I can’t seem to stop thinking about him. We still consider each other best friends and he treats me as such.\n\nI also know, given his preferences, that he would never want to be with someone like me. We aren’t even compatible, given that he wants a family and kids and I intend to remain child free.  I know in my head that it will never work out - but my heart just refuses to listen. I am filled with grief every day. How can I get over him?",

I often get invested in text conversations that require a time or emotional investment or I’m constantly handling parenting logistics, responding to family, etc. And, of course, there’s all the work messages that might come in at odd times. I usually handle things as soon as I’m notified because I fear that if I don’t address something right away, it won’t get done because I won’t remember later on. I know a big hurdle for me will be creating some kind of easy to do list system or training myself to only look at my phone at certain times, like between 8:30pm - 9pm (and can use “sorry, have to go to bed!” to cut off long and unnecessary convos that can start from just responding to a text.)\n\nAny strategies you’ve found that have worked for you?",

I don't want to use fake tan, I want to feel pretty in my pale skin but I feel like everyone around me looks better &amp; not funny like me, bcs they're matching \"the season\" so to say.

There are some compatibility issues for sure, but we  generally have been able to make it work. Generally.  \n\nI'm feeling a bit lost. My father passed away this month and it wasn't expected,  (he was older and had been sick for a few weeks). I'm dealing with this grief in ways I know aren't real healthy. Finding myself isolating a lot. I talk to friends often, family, etc, but I am not connecting with my boyfriend right now and I think it's bringing back some of the issues that existed before this happened. I knew that our emotional maturity wasn't on the same level and I honestly was worried about how things would look when a parent sadly passed. He was there physically for me and tries to be there emotionally but it's not what I need. \n\nMy boyfriend tends to make jokes to deal with pain, and he said something pretty stupid to me while all I wanted was for him to listen.   When I talk about things I'm feeling, he keeps trying to solve or share, and I just want him to listen.  I confronted him that the joke he made was just not appreciated and he felt really bad, sincerely.  But it was just so stupid.   He keeps hugging me and I don't want to be touched.  I know this is hard for him because usually we have this joking relationship.  Based on these past experiences in the last 2-3 weeks I don't even want to talk to him about it anymore since we are so not on the same page.  \n\nI look at this like one other thing on the list that we can't seem to get right.  I love him, but we are roommates. Our bedroom is dead (not from me), I get mad at how loud and inconsiderate he can be (lots of long nights playing videogames with friends).  He listens when I ask him to do something differently, but the patterns repeat.  And after almost 3 years I feel like I'm with someone who doesn't really understand me.  When I look at him he still seems like a stranger sometimes.   \n\nGoing into therapy to deal with the grief, but feeling like the one person who is supposed to get me, doesn't.   I need to have another conversation about him not interrupting or sharing his experiences and just listen. I've mentioned it, but not strongly enough.  I just worry this is another example of us not being right for each other. Has anyone else dealt with something like this?  Where grief reveals things that maybe you had tried to hide from in your relationships?  TIA.",

        "text": "I have an ok relationship with my mom. She cares, but she's difficult to communicate with, and my parents are both \"strange\" people, for lack of a better word. My dad has major issues and my husband says he doesn't know how I became a normal person after being raised by my parents. I feel for my mom a lot because I think she's a victim of an emotionally unavailable marriage, and a lot of her intellectual and emotional growth was stunted as a result of her upbringing. She grew up very poor and only finished 7th grade. I love her, but it's hard to talk to her about anything that's beyond surface level. She doesn't know how to form deep connections, she's generally uninvolved with my kids, and she has no idea how to take responsibility for anything. It's just a weird dynamic that I can't explain in a paragraph. Essentially, I was emotionally neglected as a child and I stopped being able to communicate with my parents after, say, 6th grade. I struggled with most things alone as a teen, and as a result, I don't rely on my parents for any kind of emotional support as an adult (I'm happily married and thankfully have a husband to depend on).\n\nThat was a long way to say that I dream about a close mother-daughter relationship. My one daughter (I also have a son, but this is primarily about the mother-daughter dynamic) is almost 6 and I work really hard to be everything I didn't have and wanted from my mom. I'm so jealous of friends who hang out with and talk to their moms regularly. Even though my MIL is problematic at times, she is able to hold meaningful conversations and it's refreshing talking to her. It makes me think, \"this is what it should be like to have a mom as an adult.\" \n\nIf you have a close relationship with your mom as an adult, what did she do right? What nourished that bond? Nothing would make me happier than to have my daughter as one of my friends when she's an adult--to be someone she wants to hang out with and share with and find comfort in. I don't expect her to put me on a pedestal by any means; I just want us to be friends.\n\nSorry for this completely random and mixed up post. It's just something I think about a lot.",

I'm curious to hear if you too experienced this bloating how long for? It is not the most motivating experience to have previously well fitting clothes that have become ill fitting now become even not fitting whatsoever up my thighs!",

I struggle to do small talk so I think while I’m very reliable, respected and trustworthy to deliver I lack the social skills to build casual relationships with colleagues. I am super reserved and sometimes feel the weight of being the minority/youngest in my team\n\nAnyway, I’d really welcome any tips, advice and strategies for navigating a corporate career as a woman.

        "text": "My twin sister's husband has been emotionally, verbally, and sexually abusive with her, plus he was physically abusive with his ex-wife. They've been married for 3 years, but she didn't share how unhappy she was til 6 months ago. To quote her, he \"lacks empathy,\" is \"controlling, possessive, smothering, jealous, physically aggressive when they argue (which is almost every day), and gets angry a lot.\" \n\nThey're currently in individual and couples counseling, but BIL said therapy is \"trash,\" the \"counselor is out to get him,\" and \"it doesn't matter what the counselor says because she's not the one in the relationship, they are.\" So I have little hope that he'll change his attitude and mistreatment toward my sister anytime soon.\n\nThere's been numerous incidents of him being disrespectful, controlling, and abusive - from him sabotaging her career, to not letting her pet her cat or put her hands in her pockets while talking with him, him expecting her to sacrifice a lot for his 4 kids, yelling &amp; cursing at her, forcing her to be physically affectionate when she didn't want to be, etc. But she loves/forgives him and thinks he'll change.\n\nI love my sister and don't want to push her away, but my husband and I aren't comfortable with BIL coming to our home or get-togethers. BIL doesn't mistreat her in front of the extended family, but I can't stomach the idea of welcoming him here, enabling or passively approving his behavior, or pretending everything's okay. But she's in denial that he's abusive, now claims she made a mistake sharing his mistreatment of her with me, and wants us to \"show Christian love and forgiveness.\" She's also started isolating herself again - we used to chat multiple times a week and now she's ignoring my texts and making excuses to skip our weekly phone calls.\n\nI've accepted the fact that I can't convince my sister to be open with me anymore, much less leave this toxic marriage, but I do my best to support her. Currently, we live in different states and will only see them for the holidays (we previously went camping with our kids every summer and planned on retiring near each other). This past Christmas we simply didn't talk with BIL because we didn't want to cause conflict or ruin the holiday for the kids/stepkids. But because BIL isn't welcome at our home, now my sister won't visit either - not even for our son's First Communion, her godson. \n\nSo my question is - for those of you who have abusive family or in-laws, especially those who are actively mistreating your loved ones, how do you deal with them? Do you grey rock? Do you smile and pretend everything's okay? Do you go no contact, even though it means your loved one may be pushed away?\n\nIf you have any advice or experience dealing with such situations, I'd love to hear it. Thanks y'all.",

We are a great match so far.\n\nPrior to us meeting he was a couple of months out of 10+ year relationship (engaged, no kids or house). He said for him it had ended \\~6 months earlier than that - but extracting himself took time. Obviously this is a yellow flag, and I haven't ignored it - it's been at the forefront of our dating, and we've talked about it a lot. I have never felt like a rebound or a therapist. He's been clear with his feelings towards me, and his hopes for what we could build.\n\nHe was no-contact with her for a while, after things turned toxic when he tried to get some of his stuff back after leaving. \\~ A month into us dating he told me he was in contact with her for the express purpose of trying to get his stuff back, so that he could completely close that chapter and focus on the future. He was happy to answer any Qs I had, and was open with me about how everything was going. \n\nHe eventually got his important stuff back, and that was that, or so I thought.\n\nFast forward several weeks and I asked him the other day if he had heard from her recently (came up sort of organically - he was talking about a mutual friend of theirs). He said yes, but that he didn't really want to talk about it. He said it was just her \"usual emotional pleas.\" I said it was ok that he didn't want to talk about it now, but I may want to at some point.\n\n(added context: We had a bit of a hiccup the other week where he really withdrew for a few days and I assumed he was about to call it quits. turns out it was that his mental health was rough, and thats how he processes. and my extra neediness at him withdrawing made him withdraw more. we've talked about this a bit, and it's mostly ok. we're going to come up with a plan for next time it happens, where we can both feel supported).\n\nNow, I'm a tad worried, and the main reason is because of the difference in him being proactively open about being in contact a couple of months ago, to now where I'm not sure he would've mentioned had I asked. And also if she's part of the reason his MH is poor, and the effect that has on our relationship.\n\nI wanted to get advice generally, but also to help ascertain if its reasonable\\* for me to:\n\n* to be worried about this;\n* to want more info even though he doesn't want to talk about it;\n* to think that going no-contact is the best chance for us to develop our own healthy relationship;\n* to want him to tell her, or at least to tell mutual friend, that he's seeing someone new.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\\*I know that I'm ultimately the arbiter of what is/isn't reasonable/acceptable for me, but I'd appreciate other opinions as I know I have my own emotional scar tissue that impacts how I view things.*",

        "text": "I'm in mid 30s, been married over a decade and entirely self sufficient. I never thought of my mom as overbearing when I was younger and we always had a close relationship so I just saw it as we were besties, no big deal. \n\nShe hasn't dated in over a decade. Several years ago we moved for work reasons and she went through a major depression - while I understand it's hard to have family move away, that was the point where I realized she's way too dependent on me make her happy. A few years later we lost my Gramma and that's when it got even worse. I kept trying to encourage her to meet people or go out with people she knew but she just kept saying she has no one and is alone, meanwhile she has so many coworkers who care and invited her to do things, plus acquaintances trying to get to know her but she always made excuses and chose instead to remain alone. I've also suggested several times she needs counselling but she won't because she did it ONCE and didnt like it because they told her she should join a group to meet people...\n\nNow we've moved back closer to family (about 25-30 min away to keep a buffer lol). I'm happy to be closer but the clinginess remains. We get together every weekend but then I went away for 3 weeks and she was miserable. Every time I talk about something I'm doing (like a concert) she acts upset that I don't invite her too. \n\nI've been living away for the better part of a decade, building a life with my husband and becoming a lot more independent, building a career, travelling, etc. There are going to be more travels in my future, including weekend trips away and she's gotta get used to the fact I am not committing every weekend to her and need to continue having my own life. Better yet I need her to create her own life that makes her happy instead of relying on me.\n\nGiven how emotionally fragile she is I'm not sure how to approach this without just upsetting her to the point of another major depression and feeding this learned helplessness. \n\nTLDR: I need to set boundaries with my clingy emotionally unstable mom without sending her into a spiral. \n\nAny advice is much appreciated!",

        "text": "I was dating someone for nearly 6 years, we had a few breakups in the meantime.  We were both freshly separated when we fell in love and that clouded things a lot in the beginning which led to breaks because we hadn't dealt with our shit.  \n\nIn January, we had a disagreement (small one in my mind) and he stonewalled me for 24 days (no contact).  It was very hurtful and I decided we were done.  My birthday was recently and of course he reached out to me to wish me happy birthday.  He said he didn't handle things properly at all and that he \"missed everything about me\".  I did not respond to this because I was still really hurting from what he did to me.  I was pretty stern, too about how he handled it and unlike prior transgressions, I wasn't quick to forgive.\n\nWe texted and things would seem sort of normal and then I wouldn't hear for a few days.  Finally, I called him one day and asked him what the status of us was because he was sending mixed messages and I was confused.  He never said he broke up with me, he just kept saying he messed up/fucked up, etc.  But, I eventually said- so are we broken up? and he said \"he couldn't do it anymore\" and he was frustrated and didn't know what else to do.\n\nThe next day I told him his stuff was outside of my home and he could come get it.  He kept saying again and again that he messed up and was sorry.  I stood my ground and told him that I had grown and pushed myself throughout our relationship to improve myself and he had too- and just when we finally were getting to a good groove of understanding each other, he gave up on us.  Again, more \"I fucked up, I messed up, I'm sorry's\".....I ended up telling him that the only way I would give him another chance was if he went to therapy- for him, for me, for us.  I told him he had a month to think about it and if I didn't hear from him, I would move on.\n\nA few days later, he is texting me, small talk, etc.  We decide to meet up for a drink.  Everything was still there between us.  He tells me a few minutes into meeting that he reached out to a therapist and that he knows he needs to work on himself.  The night ended in very connected, mutually pursued sex.  He texted me the next day multiple times.  The next night I asked if he wanted company.  He says \"Sure\".  I get there, he kisses me and holds me there for an intensely long time- I even went to pull away and he just held me there...it was surprising.  We start talking and he asks what I feel we need to work on to make this work.  I tell him my thoughts, he reiterates that he reached out to the therapist and they are working to get him in.  We continue to talk about the relationship and pretty abruptly, he shuts down and says he is exhausted and needs to go to bed.  I get ready to leave and he stops me and says, \"I just want to be honest, I needs to fix myself before we can fix anything with us\".  To which I calmly say, \"Ok, that's fine.  Why did we have sex then?  Because it felt like there was still a connection there- why did you just kiss me like that?\" He said there is still \"very much\" a connection but that he is so fucked up and he needs to fix himself.  I offer to leave him alone completely (no contact) and he quickly says no that he wants to keep in touch.  I leave and he keeps texting me the same thing over and over.  \n\nThe next two days, he texts me in the morning and evening, night- I am more reserved because I am really confused.  My friends tell me he is fucking with my head and to block him and move on.  My gut tells me he had many opportunities to quietly slip away and break up if that's what he wanted and was too afraid to do it....He is doing what I asked him to do (therapy), still texting me, keeping me in the loop here and there....but....I am so confused and my mind is swirling with scenarios and what ifs.....\n\nI just need some encouragement.  I am taking the space to do things for myself- gym, work, therapy, fun, family time, etc...but he really is the love of my life - and I am heartbroken.  But, vacillate between hope and a deep rooted belief that he is being truly honest with me and I should support that- and that I am a complete idiot and he is stringing me along.  (He says there is no one else and that he is just really \"fucked up and needs to fix himself\")…..\n\nThank you for sticking with the story this long and any input is greatly appreciated.",

While they may laugh at or joke about a friends situation, they at least let each other know the truth for better results. For example “Bro, I’m going to tell you where you’re going wrong with women and how to fix it.” Sometimes, it just feels like women tell you what they think you want to hear instead of being honest. I just don’t understand why it’s so hard for women to admit the fxck ups in their lives and to want to do better and to teach our younger generation not to make the same mistakes.

All moods, energy levels, pains, and bloating can be attributed to where I am in my cycle. 4 months ago, I started taking note of when my mood changes, when bloating starts, etc., and thought it would be interesting to share! I'd love to hear others' experiences :).\n\nHere's a breakdown of my cycle: \n\nMy cycles are 24–25 days on the dot. The only change I've noticed as I've aged is that they've gotten shorter, they used to be 27–28 days. \n\nDay 1: Period starts.\n\nDay 2: I could not be in a worse mood. Everyone is annoying, I can't even be arsed with people sending me texts, and don't get me started on the crazy drivers and me wanting to ram my car into them. Everything I eat causes bloating, even a piece of frumping lettuce. My low energy level + dull achy cramps have me in bed binge watching shows most of the day.\n\nDay 3: I thought my mood was getting better, I was wrong. Bloating is still bad, cramps still prevalent, and energy levels are still low. I don't normally work out on days 2 or 3 of my cycle. \n\nDay 4: Mood SIGNIFICANTLY improves; it's like a light was switched on. Bloating still slightly there but cramps are gone. \n\nDay 5: All of a sudden I feel cute again, bloating has disappeared. \n\nDay 7: I can feel my testosterone rising and my mood and energy levels are amazing.\n\nDay 9-12: Ovulation PEAK. This is when I'm in the best mood. Everyone is amazing, I want to give all the compliments, let's do all the things. My sex drive is sky-high. My workouts are beast mode. I have some ovarian pains here and there, some months worse than others. \n\nDay 14-19: Mood comes back down and I'm just operating normally.\n\nDay 20-21: Sass level goes from my normal 5-6/10 to 8-10/10. \n\nDay 23-24: Bloating begins, mood begins to become meh.\n\nDay 24-25: Period starts.",

Most responses basically rip them a new one, saying that if you don't trust your partner you shouldn't be with them and basically just advocating for 100% trust with no consideration of the fact that someone could develop feelings for their friend/co-worker over time even though they are not doing anything shady with them right now.\n\nHowever, I've recently seen some other posts crop up where people are advocating NOT to blindly trust your partner. For example, people get advised NOT to add their partner's name to the deed of the house they bought themselves. NOT to send their partner nudes that have their face on them. NOT to go to Iran with their husband, or at the very least hide their daughter's passport from him so he can't kidnap the daughter once they are there. \n\nIs it more common to think your partner might decide kidnap you or leak your nudes then to consider the fact that they might, without planning to, develop feelings over time for a friend they've been hanging out with and then handle it poorly? I feel like cheating is arguably common and it's not THAT weird to think yes, there's a chance it could happen to me someday. Yes, sometimes friends don't start out with romantic feelings but then after months of hanging out, those feelings could develop.",

If so, how long have you been together?\n\nI’m just curious bc there’s a lot of man bashing on Reddit. I myself have not found a man who isn’t half a baboon and would like to hear other perspectives. \n\nI dont know if I’m looking for a glimmer of hope or what lol just curious.",

        "text": "A little background, I'm 32F and my partner is 31M, we've been together for a year. I'm the planning type, I have my weekends sorted in advance and use my phone calendar religiously. I also communicate any updates regularly, especially if we are not together on the same trip. However, I just found out my partner is not like that at all.\n\nFor weeks he was just telling me he had \"friends coming in to town to ski\" this month. I kept asking for plans or details but he kept deflecting, saying that the group chat was too busy to keep up. Turns out, it was really a 10 fucking day boys skiing trip to the mountains. It's now day 7 and he hasn't called me once. Just a few texts in the morning and afternoon. Yesterday it was sub-zero blizzard conditions in my state, he went skiing anyway and didn't contact me from 7am to 9pm despite me trying every way to make sure he was alive. Turns out he didn't charge his phone, went backcountry skiing with just short range walkies, and then decided not to charge his phone at all on the 4 hour drive back. I told him I was not happy at all.\n\nBut honestly? It's 5am and I'm fuuuming right now and my blood is boiling. I tried to sleep on it, but it only made me angrier. I went on a 10 day trip last summer for my sister's college graduation and despite being deep in the National Parks, I called him 3 times in the 10 days. We had only been together 2 months at that time and I feel like I'm getting less respect than that a year later!!\n\nHe knows he sucks at planning and I've already explained I need him to communicate better. He gave me 0 heads up on these plans and then when he did know, never once called me. We are planning on moving in together this summer but now I'm really reconsidering it. \n\nAm I being unreasonable here? I'm so angry and I can't tell if it's justified or not. Female perspectives only please.",

I want to love my body in all of the stages it's going to take to hopefully get back to \"normal\".\n\nI feel like in the past two months, I have started to finally feel my age (38) because of all of this-- I'm slower, easier to tire, more lazy and less active, etc.\n\nI don't know-- I'm just looking for any advice or personal stories that might make me feel better in how I'm doing right now.",
