        "text": "Lately, I feel like the top Youtube comments have improved a lot in quality.  Now, obviously, the most likely culprit for this is some change in the Youtube's sorting of its comments or its functionality of liking comments.  But I also can't help but feel that the top Youtube comments these days tend to feel a bit Reddit-like to me.  There's more \"meme humor\" or internet humor infused in them, whereas it used to be that Youtube comments had a more \"Facebook flavor,\" a more \"general population\" flavor to them IMHO.  (I may also have a biased sample in that many of the videos I see are linked from Reddit.)  \n\nHas anyone else had this feeling?  I wonder if it's due to more Reddit people commenting or liking comments on Youtube, or whether it's the general population that was first commenting on Youtube that has started to use Reddit more and more, and then bringing back \"Reddit-style humorous comments\" back to Youtube.  Kind of a silly question, I know.  I used to put \"4chan style comments\" on one end of the spectrum (in terms of memey-ness and edginess), Facebook comments on the other end (very \"general population\" feeling), Reddit comments somewhere in the middle, with Youtube comments very close to Facebook comments.  These days, I would put Youtube comments much closer to Reddit comments in likeness rather than Facebook comments.",

        "text": "The observation that Reddit has become politically polarized has been made frequently.  It seems there are two opposing groups - the alt-right, and the progressives - that drive most political discussion, with very little in-between.  To get anything else you must venture to the less subscribed subreddits, which appear to have fewer problems.\n\nI think that this might be an inevitable outcome of a system where communities are grouped together in \"folders.\"  Subreddits are meant to be places to submit bits of content that have similar properties.  This is to make it easier for the user to find what they're looking for.  This site was built around the idea of putting content in folders, but it seems to have inadvertently put the *people* in folders as well.\n\nTo put it less dramatically, there are certain combinations of subreddits that appear more often in a user's list of subscriptions than others.  People who frequently visit /r/The_Donald are less inclined to visit /r/politics (unless purposely engaging the other side), and vice-versa.  Instead of one big bucket that we all begrudgingly ride in together, there are two smaller buckets with more similarity between the users.  Users are given the choice to self-segregate and form cliques, until eventually new users cannot choose *not* to form cliques as the two opposing factions become too dissimilar to be logically consistent.  This is until somebody takes charge and creates a new \"neutral\" subreddit, only for the cycle to repeat itself (see: *real-X* subreddits).\n\nTo be fair, this is what any vBulletin forum would have done by default.  The old forums of the early 2000s were themselves proto-subreddits where similar people would congregate, and the web was Reddit.  However, it was more difficult to observe the existence of an out-group, since you would have to be familiar with many different websites in order to do so.\n\nThe idea of grouping content together is so fundamental to Reddit that it is very unlikely to change.  A website that properly lubricates discussion would probably do away with folders and have less discrete boundaries.  The more popular social media websites are however content-based, not discussion-based, so there doesn't seem to be as much of an incentive to fix discussion as there is to cluster content for users to consume.\n\nHow accurate of a picture does this paint, and what are potential solutions to this problem?",

In subreddits that are echo chambers, this just leads to the same shallow  discussions over and over. \n\nPersonally I cannot stand seeing massively upvoted comments that obviously came from someone that just read the headline. This means that most voters and not just commenters are doing the same thing. So how can we fix this? Would it be possible to require commenters click the article before they are able to comment? Would this have any downsides that possibly outweigh the pros? Would it perhaps be better to just have a note at the top of every comment section strongly suggesting you read thr article for the sake of improving the quality of this website?

        "text": "Please read first\n\nI used to be a mod for a subreddit. It's top mod had a thing for free speech and forced the rest of the mods to stop banning people. He banned bots only. \n\nOur sub was a national sub and was almost always politically charged. His solution was a spam filter. He programmed the filter with the names of people that were troublesome, which would automatically put their posts and comments into the mod queue, awaiting approval. Then, he would go ahead and approve EVERYTHING that anyone ever said except bots and those that broke the rules. This means that even those that COULD shill and do shady stuff were also allowed. If we removed a comment that we deemed was unfit but did not break the rules, he would warn us and approve the comment again. It eventually worn me out and I quit before I couldn't handle it anymore. \n\nAn example of what would be removed or approved if he were modding:\n\n\"What a piece of shit you are\" Removed. Breaking rules. I agree. \n\n\"This [insert controversial political party] is the BEST THING EVER. All you people need to stop dwelling in your parent's basements and see the world for what it is!\" Approved. Not Breaking the rules. I disagree. \n\nHis thinking: We were a small subreddit trying to make it into the top so we had to compromise. There were others like us so competition was up. It doesn't matter what you think of the post,  as long as it's an opinion, it's good to be approved. The thing to compromise was to handle everybody. Fair point, but to what price? \n\nWhat I think:\n\nI thought that banning is necessary because some people might be shilling or using the sub for political reasons beyond \"casually redditing\", if you catch my drift. Other than that, the price that we had to pay was getting people to stay.  Our top mod did not understand that the voting system could dissuade people from engaging in our sub again. Here's how. Remember that approved comment above? Imagine that you see that comment with a +6 votes. You will probably think that this sub really likes said controversial political party and decide to pack your bags and leave. Now say that the same user that posted that comment is consistent in his efforts so much so that he is willing to hop on reddit, write a comment, and be willing to provide walls of text to prove his point but anyone challenging him either doesn't feel like or doesn't want to spend time arguing on reddit so he comes up with a weak argument. Result, the former user has a higher vote count than the latter. This dissuades people with a better rationale from coming to the sub ever again. I mean, how would you react to something like this:\n\n- \"[Controversial comment]\" +10 upvotes\n\n- \"[yours or others' rational argument]\" +2 upvotes\n\n\n\nAgain, to recap, the important key words to remember are :\n\n- Small subreddit seeking growth\n\n- Small mod team (2-4)\n\n- the voting dissuades people\n\n- other subs with high competition \n\n- Openness to any comment or post\n\n**What do you  think?** \n-",

One might think intuitively that this is prohibited by the site rules but it isn't, at least not under the harassment prohibition:\n\n&gt;We do not tolerate the harassment of people on our site, nor do we tolerate communities dedicated to fostering harassing behavior.\n\n&gt;&gt;Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.\n\n&gt;Being annoying, vote brigading, or participating in a heated argument is not harassment, but following an individual or group of users, online or off, to the point where they no longer feel that it's safe to post online or are in fear of their real life safety is.\n\nThis applies to the harassment of an individual, but what about when an individual isn't targeted but one of those protected groups above? We could examine not just whether or not the members were doxxing/theatening individuals but whether or not a user/subreddit is focused on harassing a group (which, to the individuals of that group, has the same chilling effect on their ability to participate openly).\n\nUpdating that above paragraph to include \"a class of people\" rather than just referencing the harassment of a specific person would make enforcement easy and ban egregious hate speech.",

It's unique how 'strong' both camps are on reddit at the moment.

And when things get sticky, they can just 'retreat' into their subreddit (/r/the_donald, /r/politics). \n\nI might be talking bollocks, but what do you guys think.

But with Reddit we offer a level of connection that is much deeper. People are coming to find out about their communities and their passions.\n\n\n# \n\n&gt;Our general ethos at Reddit is to create more discussion and not less. And what we’ve found is that when it comes to this post-facts world, interestingly enough, the communities on Reddit are pretty good at self-regulating and have started developing tools on their own to flag data sources as being suspect.\n\n#\n\n&gt;I hope we can play a really big role in helping people know what it real and what isn’t. Obviously there are things that are demonstrably true and demonstrably false when it comes to news but there’s also a big grey area where interpretation plays a role. I think a lot of the grey area of this new world we live in simply comes from people digging deeper into their echo chambers and not wanting to consider other perspectives.\n\n#\n\n&gt;By letting people sort comments with up votes and down votes you get all the benefits of scale because you can have literally hundreds of thousands of people watching a thread around an event. It promotes engagement and lets the best content, as determined by the crowd, bubble up to the top. That’s the magic of Reddit. It’s a signal-to-noise ratio that rewards people for really great comments and contributions.\n\n[relink to source](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/media/reddit-we-can-fix-fake-news-unlike-google-facebook/news-story/e81b6f2b3194aaec2b564b859e9bbf6b)\n\nFeel free to share any other thoughts and reactions to this vision for reddit and what it entails for us as redditors.",

        "text": "First, obligatory link to the continuously-updated Astroturfing Information Megathread.  Its main purpose is to [categorize and archive factual information on shilling.](https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=iyc3jh2c&amp;sh=892c7094) It currently has over 70 citations, mostly reports in the mainstream press detailing various astroturfing programs by many governments and corporations. We also have a [list of shill confessions.](https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/5pzcnx/shill_confessions_and_additional_information/?st=iyc3r7x4&amp;sh=fe5da973) \n\n-------------------------------\n\nA lot of people have the false impression that Reddit is a niche wonderland (or wasteland), unknown to the majority of the country. This causes people to question why anyone would hire Reddit shills in the first place. If there isn't much of an audience, why manipulate Reddit? \n\nAt least until very recently with the change in the submission vote count, a post on /r/all may have received 6,000 upvotes. Does this mean that 6,000 people liked the post, and perhaps a total of 10,000 viewed it? Not even close. \n\nComparing Reddit.com to CNN.com, Reddit is 3 times more popular. The majority of Reddit's traffic is what is on /r/all during peak traffic hours, which is around 6-10 pm EST. Shills may not be interested in most of the content of a subreddit, but you bet they will be interested in the top post, especially if it hits /r/all or has the potential to later in the day. \n\nCNN.com averages about [5 million unique visitors per day](https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/05/record-traffic-day-at-cnncom-27-million-uniques-276-million-page-views/) and 417 million per month. \n\nFoxnews.com: [240 million per month](https://www.similarweb.com/website/foxnews.com#overview)\n\nMSNBC.com: [20-30 million per month](https://www.similarweb.com/website/msnbc.com#overview)\n\n**However, Reddit.com is the** [7th most popular website](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com) **in the United States and has** [1.2 **b**illion unique visitors per month.](https://www.similarweb.com/website/reddit.com#overview)\n\nFor television, [the total average viewership over a 24-hour period in 2015 for CNN was 490,000; for MSNBC 352,000; and Fox News 1.1 million viewers.](http://www.mediaite.com/online/fox-news-leads-in-revenue-ratings-cnn-gets-the-largest-surge-in-viewership/) (Monthly totals would be about 10 million, 15 million, and 30 million)\n\nYou may have seen the post on The_Donald that claimed their subreddit has more traffic than CNN. This was a shitpost, but as you can see above, they were on the right track. \n\nThe Donald has about 2.5 - 3 million unique IP addresses per month, and about 200 - 250 thousand unique IP addresses per day. The claim that The_Donald has more traffic than CNN is obviously wrong. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/about/traffic/\n\n/r/pics gives a better picture of the kind of traffic and engagement that /r/all can receive. They have about a half million unique visitors per day and about 8 million per month. https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/about/traffic/\n\nYou can check other subreddits by substituting the name of the sub (if they allow the traffic stats to be available to the public)\n\n",

I wonder if such a result has any implications for reddit, which is a site that can harness crowd wisdom -- for example, the various \"Ask____\" subreddits. \n\nAn intuitive explanation for the efficacy of the \"surprisingly popular\" heuristic is that when enough answers are sampled, the sample population will include a minority of experts whose answers should carry more weight since they are more often correct.\n\nCould the reddit voting algorithms identify correct answers more reliably by exploiting this research?

        "text": "This is something I've noticed since Redditing for 8+ years (I delete accounts every so often).  Once upon a time, a single typo in any argument would instantly become the only thing discussed, with the offender being mercilessly mocked for being too stupid to spell.\n\nThat's no longer the case, and now typos are barely mentioned at all.  Most gilded, bestof posts contain typos as well, and they're never mentioned or corrected.\n\nI think it's due to the rise of smartphones and Reddit apps, and more people engaging on Reddit via their phone than through a keyboard.  So now everyone has typos, and calling them out makes you look like a tool.\n\nGranted, calling out a typo was always a cop-out for someone losing an argument, but now that escape route has been cut off.\n\nSomething I find interesting. If someone has a different theory, I'd be interested.",

        "text": "I was browsing r/all when I came across a discussion in the subreddit cringe anarchy about how the 'related subreddits' in the information bar included the Donald and the Alt right subreddits. A lot of people were voicing displeasure with how the previously politically neutral sub had been turned into an echo chamber for the so called 'anti-SJW' and Trump movements, and discussed how a lot of the anti SJW rhetoric has enabled actual racism to creep in to the aforementioned subs. \n\nI know Reddit has historically been pretty hostile towards the alt right subreddits (as they are literal nazis) but had gained the impression that a lot of anti-liberal, anti-SJW views were passed off as the norm on subs like cringe anarchy in the last. This new discussion seems to indicate some sort of backlash against certain elements of those views.\n\nSo in conclusion, do you think in light of Trump's win, that Reddit as a whole is seeing a backlash against  anti-SJW views that were previously common, and do you think that indicates a leftward shift in opinions?",
