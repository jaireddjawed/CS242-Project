        "text": "Recently, my friend told me she's struggling with post-partum depression. I wanted to help but didn't know how so I gave her a list of things I'd be willing to help with: cleaning her home, cooking food for her, shoveling snow off the driveway, running errands for her, financial help, or a compliment a day. She requested the daily compliment. It's been fun to give out and it's an easy way to help someone else out. I told my therapist about it and she said doing something as simple as giving people praise when they're going through a hard time is a practical way to provide support. And that she would try it with her sister. As a friend or family member you can't always offer the exact support they need especially if it's grief, loss, or a medical issue. So where possible, give people a few options and try to include an emotional gesture in your list of suggestions.",

I’ve always worked full time jobs and my gaming would never affect my job or sleep. Even now being married for 3 years I still can play 6 or so hours straight on days off with my friends without a thought. I don’t ignore my wife or neglect my kids at all but I don’t feel like I should be giving my gaming more time than them. My wife never complains about it because if she needs me I will get up when I get the chance to help with what she needs but I’ll usually go back to gaming after. Gaming has always been a fun hobby of mine that helps reduce any stress or depression I gain mostly from my work so it’s not something I want to drop entirely. But I feel like my family needs more of me. Any advice?",

        "text": "Physical therapy with insurance: $400-500 a session. Without it? $90 flat fee. It won't count towards your deductible but if you have a high deductible and are pretty sure you won't hit it before the end of the year or before you change plans then you might as well pay yourself. Same with medications with goodrx instead of insurance. Also it seems ultrasounds and ct scans and such can fall under this as well. Again this is all based on your deductible and how much they cover after you hit it. Let's look at an example where you need 10 PT sessions.\n\n$9,000 deductible and they will pay everything after you hit it.\n\nWith insurance: You pay $400 x 10 = $4000. You don't hit the deductible and they cover nothing.\n\nWithout insurance: You pay $90 x 10 = $900. You still wouldn't have hit the deductible and they cover nothing.\n\n$400 deductible and they will pay 90% after you hit it.\n\nWith insurance: You pay $400 x 1 and then $40 x 9 = $760. You hit the deductible and they cover enough to make it worth it.\n\nWithout insurance: You pay $90 x 10 = $900. You would have hit the deductible and now you are paying more because they cover nothing.\n\nBut still be careful. In the first example with the $9,000 deductible if you end up needing $10,000 of other procedures while not using your insurance would make the PT cheaper you would miss out on hitting your deductible quicker and end up paying more out of pocket overall ($900 for the PT and $9,000 out of the $10,000 for the deductible = $9,900 instead of $9,000 total if you just did everything through the insurance.)\n\nThese are just simple examples with made up numbers but hopefully you get the idea. But if you do have a plan with a ridiculously high deductible that doesn't cover anything before you hit it and you didn't get a huge injury that is likely to take you over it you could very well be better off not using your insurance.",

How?\n\n1) It forces you to reach out to your larger team, and in doing so, you meet the new people, and reconnect with some old ones you haven’t talked to in a while.\n\n2) it also connected me with a former colleague, who left our firm 5 years ago and wants to do lunch with me next week. I’ve been thinking about interviewing and he could be a great resource. NETWORKING. Plus- That guy reached out to a former colleague that retired from our firm and who I miss! \n\n3) Everybody wants to be in a Super Bowl pool but nobody wants to do the leg work- people keep thanking me for running it.
