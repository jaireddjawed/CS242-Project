We do accept debit deposits, so he paid a $200\\* deposit then went to park his car. On his way out the door, he drops his debit card. Another guest hands it to us at the desk and we held onto it until he returned from parking. My shift was ending at that time so I was walking out, only to see this guy dropped a $10\\* bill on his way in. I chased him to the elevator to return it.\n\nCut to the next day after he checks out (yesterday). Housekeeping inspects his room only to find this guys debit card sitting in the drawer. We kept it at the front desk so he could come back for it (he must have gone back to the room after checkout because we returned the deposit to the same card). He comes to pick up his debit card later last night and informs the desk that he left $500\\* in the drawer as well. The agents inform him the room has already been inspected and another guest is currently in that room, but took his phone number letting him know we will call him with an update tomorrow (today).\n\nSo of course, today comes around and we call him to tell him nothing was found in the room again today, and that the housekeeping supervisor confirmed with the cleaners that no money was found. He got belligerent, asking if we thought he was stupid, did the money grow legs and walk away, that he \"knows\" he left the cash in the drawer before he went to bed (if you knew that why didn't you grab it before you left?).\n\nThe things I wanted to say to this man but didn't should get me an Oscar. I used to cry when people would yell at me but I fully kept my cool and told him he could call back tomorrow to speak with a manager.\n\nWhat I wanted to say, Yeah. I do think you are an idiot because you keep dropping things out of your pocket, and who the hell carries $500\\* cash around without making absolutely sure you have it with you at all times?!\n\n\\*amounts slightly changed for extra anonymity.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678639208.0},{"title":"Got my first negative review","author":"TheBotchedLobotomy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11pthho\/got_my_first_negative_review\/","text":"It was a particularly busy Sunday morning.

I said no, I\u2019m terribly sorry, but today I simply cannot offer that courtesy as housekeeping needs all the time they can get to prepare for another near full house today. \n\n\nHere is where my grave mistake was made. \n\n\nI told her \u201cno I cannot offer late checkout, but I will give you until 1130 before I charge you for another day\u201d \n\n\nShe took this as a late checkout 1130.

I get a angry phone call to the desk, followed immediately by an even angrier interaction at the desk.

Not that I\u2019d want to resuscitate a guest who gave me hell anyway. \n\nSigh, I just wanted to enjoy my last day of work before my weekend and fools just had to make it totes stressful...\n\nSo anyways, I've got one arrival left here at the [REDACTED] Motel and we're sold out, so when this guy comes in to check in, I'm disappointed it isn't said arrival (as a full house means I can do end-of-shift reports early), but instead some guy, who I'll alias as Joe Jankmemes, who looks pretty drunk or otherwise spaced out. Upon seeing his ID and his debit card, I inform him we don't have a res under his name.\n\nJoe swears up and down he has a res here, I check not just our property management system, but also our extranets for third-party booking websites like E[gg]pedia, B[a]king.com, and Hot[cake]s.com, but nope, nothing. I check the hotel's main email account, which gets emails for new booking confirmations made online, regardless of whether it's through a 3rd-party site or the hotel website...nope, nothing there either.\n\nSo I ask him to present a confirmation email or other evidence that he made a reservation. While, like I said, we were sold out tonight, I would've at least tried to walk him to a sister property, cancel for free if that's not an option, or get him a refund if he prepaid for his reservation (not that it would help him find someplace else to stay if money is tight, because card refunds take several business days to process). But instead of providing anything even remotely helpful, Mr. Jankmemes just opens his texting app and shows me a bunch of automated bank texts. I point this out, I ask him again, can you show me a confirmation email that proves you did book here at the [DATA EXPUNGED] Motel?\n\nI just try to hand him his ID and card back, but he's still lazily scrolling through his bank texts, I try to get his attention and he accuses me of being rude. Like bro, you are trying to do business with me and you are not doing anything related to this transction. *PAY ATTENTION TO ME, THE FRONT DESK EMPLOYEE ON DUTY, DIPSHIT.*\n\n(As a general rule, even if you're not being a shitfaced fool who thinks bank 2-factor texts amount to hotel confirmation, if you are poking around on your phone for irrelevant purposes or having an equally irrelevant phone conversation when you are checking in, I will politely, but firmly tell you that I am happy to assist you *when you're done with your phone.*)\n\nEventually he starts to pack his things and asks me for some nearby other hotels he could try, I tell him where he can get a room (while making it a point that we're not going to confirm if they have rooms or any of their policies, that's up to him to find out). He gets in an Uber and leaves. Well that's the end of him, right?\n\n**Wrong.**\n\nJoe comes back a couple hours later after midnight. And for some reason he's holding a caulking tube in his hand. I ask him what I can help him with, now he's insisting he has a room here. Like not just a reservation, he swears he's already staying here.\n\n> **Me:** What's your room number?\n>\n> **Joe:** I DON'T KNOW!\n>\n> **Me:** *(sigh)* Look. We don't have you checked into a room. We don't have a reservation for you. If you can provide me a confirmation email or something else as evidence that you booked a room with us, I can figure out a solution for you.\n>\n> **Joe:** *MY NAME'S JOE JANKMEMES, THAT'S MY CONFIRMATION!!*\n\nAnd then he starts to throw swear words at me. I generally don't take offense to swear words in and of themselves (partly because there's way worse things one can say to me, like [homophobic slurs](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/wzzgwm\/got_called_slurs_because_i_committed_the_mortal\/)), but seeing as he's giving me some blatant attitude at this point, I inform him that we are exercising our right as a business to refuse service and if he doesn't GTFO in the next 2 minutes, I'm calling the police.\n\nUnsurprisingly at this point, Joe does not comply, nah he just goes deeper into the parking lot of the motel. I set a 2-minute timer on my watch, it comes and goes without him leaving, so I call the \uff43\uff4f\uff50\uff53 on him because this guy is now a trespasser and he's making me feel mighty unsafe. I also lock the front office up because fuck this guy.\n\nCops show up, Joe's warned not to come back or else I have the right to call the cops again and have him sent to jail. Only, he doesn't get the hell out immediately. Once cops start to pull away from the property, he tries to walk back on...only for the cops to loop around the block and catch him, at which point he leaves and never comes back...but only for the rest of my shift.\n\nAccording to my coworker's report, he came back during the morning shift while I had my day off, still piss drunk, still insisting he had a booking when he literally hasn't made one for here in months, and now he's on Do Not Rent. Or \"Dinner\", as I like to shorten it to. Hopefully it's the last I ever see of him.\n\nAnd...I understand substance abuse is rarely ever the root problem, it's often a sign of something deeper, and people who do that kind of thing of such deserve to get the help they need and not have it be held against them for the rest of their life. But at the end of the day, Joe's still responsible for his own actions, whether sober or not, and I hope he sees this night as a catalyst to start seeking the help he needs.\n\n**Tall deer:** Drunk guest tries to check in for nonexistent booking, comes back later and insists he's already checked in, gets Totes Mad and starts swearing at me when I tell him the truth, he's removed for trespassing and put on DNR.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678616647.0},{"title":"Just had an awesome experience with the front desk!","author":"Goal1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11q31q6\/just_had_an_awesome_experience_with_the_front_desk\/","text":"So I checked in to a hotel while traveling.

The lady on the phone said that was fine for the government rate.\"\n\nOh.  Not even a state government employee.  A contractor.  Let's pause here to explain one thing.  The government rate is technically for federal employees traveling on federal business.  We'll also extend it to military, both active and retired, because quite frankly that could easily become a PR shitstorm we don't want if that kind of thing goes viral.\n\nBut it's not available to state employees.  Nor is it available to federal contractors(I'd actually had to explain that to a federal contractor earlier in the evening, but she didn't make a fuss).\n\nSo, if it's not available to either of those, why in hell would it be available to a combination of the two?\n\nIt wouldn't.\n\nI tried to explain this, quite diplomatically.\n\nKD wouldn't have any of it, so she called our corporate reservations line.\n\nDuring the next 15 minutes, they manage to finally pull up the email, and show it to me.  The look of triumph, my friends, as if they'd dealt the death blow.\n\nMe:  \"Indeed, you were able to book it.  However, without the proper credentials, I can't honor it.  Even if the reservation had come through, I wouldn't have been able to do so.\"\n\nKD:  \"Fine, I'll just wait for your corporate to answer.\"\n\nKM:  \"So you can't sell us a room?\"\n\nMe:  \"I'm more than happy to do so.  Just can't at that rate without a federal government ID.\"\n\nSome more back and forth, basically repeating ourselves.  They try to play on my emotions.  Ha.\n\nFinally, they get through the queue and talk to CR.  I can hear her telling them how mean I am for not honoring that rate because they get it everywhere.  Meanwhile, I've pulled up our job aid and guidelines on the government rate.  Had bookmarked them earlier in the evening when I was explaining it to the federal contractor.\n\nKM, her phone back to hold music:  \"She's going to call you.  She'll sort this out.\"\n\nPhone rings.  I give my required greeting.\n\nCR:  \"So our guest is telling me that you won't honor her rate?\"\n\nMe:  \"Unfortunately, we do not have a rate of that nature that would apply to her.  We do not have a State Government rate.  And even if we did, government rates don't apply to contractors, only employees(well, there are some ancillary groups that also get it, but that doesn't apply here).\n\nCR:  \"Guest has stated that she gets that rate all the time, and you're the first person at one of our properties to deny it.  You must honor it.  It is <corporate> policy.\"\n\nMe, internally:  \"Okay, these assholes DID give her that rate knowing full well that she didn't qualify.\"\n\nAlso Me, internally:  \"Well, that's their problem.\"\n\nAlso Also Me, internally:  \"JENKINS!  NOOOO!!!!\"\n\nMe:  \"It's <corporate> policy to ignore <corporate> policy?  Can you quote me the job aid or policy document number so I can verify it?  Because I'm looking at Job Aid <number> as well as document <other number> which CLEARLY state that I am only to offer the federal government rate to federal employees traveling on business.  It does also state that we can have a separate rate for state government employees, but it isn't required.  It also states that contractors are not eligible for EITHER rate.  As our guest is a contractor, she is not eligible for the rate.  And as she is a state contractor, she's further not eligible for the rate that doesn't exist at this hotel.\"\n\nCR:  \"There's nothing you can do to honor this for the guest?\"\n\nMe:  \"Unfortunately, not without violating <corporate> policy.\"\n\nCR:  <pause>  \"I guess I'll inform our guest.\"\n\nMe:  \"Please do.\"\n\nAfter I hang up, they go to the far end of the lobby and are talking with CR.\n\nKM give it one last try.\n\nKM:  \"There's nothing you can do?

Guess we're doing it.  You'll get in trouble.\"\n\nMe:  \"If that's what has to happen, I understand.\"\n\nAnd then they leave, but not before KD glares at me.  We got a service case.

It is by no means a bad part of town but we get our fair share of sketchy guests. Lately we've been getting an epidemic of party rooms. Locals who rent a room or three and invite a large number of other groups (large swaths of teenagers, kids birthday parties, lots of drunk adults coming back from bars and clubs, etc.) back to the hotel and all squeeze into our small double queen studios. We have a pretty strict no party policy, you can be evicted if we believe you're hosting a party at our hotel, though it doesn't get enforced as much as I would like.\n\nTonight was one such night, and now that I'm home and hopefully the police have left, I don't know my shift had been finished for over an hour and they hadn't left before I did, I can share this tale.\n\nWe had a minimum of 4 suspected parties spread throughout 6 rooms. One in particular seemed to be, in hindsight, a bunch of unsupervised teenagers. Well supposedly a guest of the guest's daughter in this particular room invited a small group of guys to this party. When they arrived I asked where they were headed and they stated plainly \"out back\". They proceeded to meet someone by the back door and head out to the smoking patio. After they returned inside they stood around in the lobby and loitered in the hallways for a good 30 minutes before the guest's daughter came up to us and informed us they weren't with the group. Me and security were keeping an eye on them but by the second time the guest came up and said they didn't want them there, we stepped up and told them they had to leave. They argued with us, saying they were trying to get an uber but our states currently a non-stop snowstorm and rides were few and far between. \n\nAfter a bit of arguing I told them they could have 30 more minutes to wait for their ride before I call the police for trespassing. They had arrived around 9pm and this happened at 9:30. They made a fuss and tried to act tough, it was teen boys after all, no older than 16\/17. I taunted \"oh you wanted me to call the police now\" and they quieted down. After their thirty minutes were up security went over to see what was going on and apparently their uber that was \"on the way\" cancelled on them so they were still trying to find a ride. Security and I decided that we understood this situation, due to the bad weather and icy roads, and gave them a bit more time. \n\nMy shift ended at 11 so I told security I wasn't gonna pass this off to the night auditor, if they're not gone by then, I'm calling the police. In that time, I called the hotel manager and she was fully on board with my choice and was even a little surprised I hadn't called by now. \n\nAround 10:45, I get an unexpected call from a women looking for a supervisor, that would be me. She tells me shes aware of the loitering teens and that we were gonna make them leave by 11, probably my fault for telling them but I would rather they know our intentions. She goes on a whole thing about \"they were invited by the party room, this isn't fair, we can't call police on a bunch of young black boys cause police tend to kill them, you know you're going home safe but if you call the police, they wont be\". I completely agree with her and whole heartily do not want to call the police on these boys but at that point it had been almost 2 hours, they've been told to leave repeatedly and they just hadn't. I agree to give the mom a few more minutes to make some calls and figure stuff out. She eventually calls me back around 11:15 saying that she ordered an Uber it just hadn't been picked up by a driver yet and it should be there soon. Her son had supposedly separated himself from the group and could wait for the ride. Cool, when the police come Ill see if I can say he is cool to wait a bit longer but the rest gotta go. I call our local police department, say this isn't an emergency, I've just got unsupervised teens trespassing in the lobby. They take our info and say someone will be there, eventually.\n\nPretty soon after I call, my security guy overhears them say that if police come their gonna try to duck into the party room, so I mentally prepare myself to keep my eye on them. Not 5-10 minutes later the first officer pulls into our parking lot and as soon as the boys see them they stand up and start walking down the halls. I tell security they bolted and to follow them to the side stairway exit, they're probably trying to run run. I meet the officer outside the front door and tell him that they're probably trying to run out the side door and he turns and immediately starts running that way. \n\nI go back into the hotel and head down the hallway after them to find security holding the side door open and tons of fresh footprints in the snow heading towards the back of the hotel. I start heading back that way and I round the corner to see cops had already cut off the teens and had them stopped. Not seeing any use being involved anymore, I went back to the desk. After a while the sergeant comes in with the kid whose mom I spoke with and I told him what was going on. He asked if we knew the road conditions and how hard it would be to find a ride right now and I confirmed I did, which is why I gave them 2 hours to find a ride before calling. He takes the son aside and they start talking and eventually it sounds like they're gonna take him to the station to wait for his mom's uber there. \n\nAfter a while the officer starts taking the kid to the back to get in his squad car when they ask if the kid can use the bathroom, so I go down and unlock it for them. We don't have a public bathroom, you need a room key to access them. I let him in and head back to the desk to watch the events unfold out back on the cameras. Police had a few of the other kids in cuffs and were patting them down. Security, my night auditor, and I were speculating on why that was when another guest comes to the desk and says that she thinks they need me, motioning towards the bathrooms. I leave and head down the hall to the bathroom to find that the officer had put the kid in cuffs. Confused I asked what they needed and the officer said to open the bathroom. I do immediately. He does a quick inspection before starting to pat down this kid. I'm thinking oh maybe he has drugs on him and he tried to get rid of them in the bathroom real quick or something, weed is very common but still mostly illegal here.\n\nNOPE! The officer proceeds to pull a loaded handgun with one of those extended magazines out of this kids pants. I'm standing there, my jaw all the way on the floor, when my security guard walks up behind me, just as surprised. Were standing there, dumbfounded, as we watch this officer haul this kid out the back door. Still watching out the back, we see another officer searching behind the ac unit just outside the door, when from behind it he pulls another loaded handgun out of the snow.\n\nAll in all the police found three handguns, two which were \"ghost guns\". They were supposedly about to let all the boys go as long as they leave the property until one of the officers spotted the gun laying in the snow just out back. They ended up searching the whole property for any more discarded weapons and asking us a bunch of questions about the boys actions before they got there. They said they might need video footage and head outside. I showed my security guy and auditor how to get the footage and waited for a bit longer before security told me that he could handle the rest and that I could leave, since by that point it was already after 12:30 and he knew I had an early morning tomorrow (today).

He was surprised, and when I asked him to contact \"M\", he said he would see what he could do. Haven't heard back from him personally since, but more on that later.\n\nA commenter suggested I take my post to the \"M\" subreddit to get some more information on how I proceed with my issue. I did, and I was able to find a bit of corporate information. I will be contacting them on Monday.\n\nThe biggest issue is what information I got from AM shift yesterday. She told me my manger had watched the cameras and saw the whole encounter, but he will not be reporting to \"M\" because he will be getting in trouble for having lackluster security. He told AM shift this to her face. I am obviously upset by this. I can't even go to his superior, because that is his father. There is no HR for my property, nothing. I literally have to climb the corporate ladder to get some justice for myself. My manager also told AM that the shiny will not be losing their status for this, but that makes no sense. Does \"M\" just let their employees be at the mercy of whoever encounters them?\n\nAnyways, it's been a week for me. Nobody had my back that night, and nobody still does (besides y'all's). That's the update I have, and I'll be documenting this fiasco as much as I can.\n\nThank you, guys, for helping me thus far, the \"M\" subreddit and this one.

The friend les call her Taylor (I don\u2019t know her name) was not staying with the guest just visiting. Jim wanted to know if there was anything I could do to get her to leave. I let him know the only thing I could do was call the police and have her trespassed off the property. He stepped away to call him GF to let her know and ask if she wanted me to take this course of action. A minute later he came back and asked me to call. He went back to the room while I was on the phone. A few minutes after I hung up he called the desk asking for the ETA, letting me know that they managed to get her out of the room but she was now banging on the door. I told him probably 5 minutes as I just got off the phone with them. He said Thank you and hung up.\n\nThe cops got here a minute later (fastest they have ever come) I told them what going on and they went up. I went to snoop on the cameras to watch. She ended up getting on the elevator with them so they didn\u2019t even have to go to the room. They walked her out of the hotel and talked to her for a few minutes. \n\nWhen Jim came down, they talked to him as well. Once done, Jim his GF and another friend went to out back patio. The cops then left, leaving Taylor outside my hotel. She came to the front door wanting to be let in (I had the doors locked) I told her that I can\u2019t let her in as she was not a paying guest and the paying guest do not want her here. She walked away for a minutes before coming back. When I walked to the back she would hold down the buzzer we have. I told her to stop. This went back and forth a few times before I went to get Jim to ask what he would like me to do, he told me the cops said they would bring her home, he also told me to just leave her out there. So I did, but she kept coming back to the door and holding down the buzzer. Now this buzzer is crazy loud and I kept telling her to stop. She then decides that her phone is still in the room and she needs it. SO I walk back to Jim to ask about her phone. They tell me she has it, but Jim does get up to go talk to her while the GF goes to double check that her phone was not in the room. \n\nShe is begging him to let her stay but he is refusing. When GF comes back she tells her the phone is not in the room. \n\nJim and co go back to their room, leaving Taylor outside. She never comes back to the door and eventually she walks away. A few hours later I see her walking the parking lot again but I have no clue where she went and never saw her again.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678609214.0},{"title":"For overnight auditors, what is your sleep schedule like, and how has the job impacted your social life and daily routine?","author":"StellarDiscord","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11prlin\/for_overnight_auditors_what_is_your_sleep\/","text":"Please let me know if this doesn\u2019t belong here, I just couldn\u2019t find another sub similar to this one.

I got hired through connections and felt under qualified. The higher ups aren't really nice to me because I made a lot of mistakes. After 3 months I decided to quit because the job stressed me out. I ended up crying a lot when I came home too. I had a meeting with my boss and she told me \"that's nice you offered to work 2 weeks but I think you can leave today. Because to be honest, I don't want anymore mistakes.\" My boss has also told me before she only hired me because I know the manager personally. \n\nI'm aware that I'm not a good fit for the job but her words still stung a bit. I've also complained about work in previous posts. Because it was my first job I didn't immediately notice the red flags. I started noticing when I talked to my friends about it and posting on Reddit. I realized the boss doesn't seem to like me, and the manager is insanely strict because since she recommended me it reflects back onto her. Then I ran into a few rude customers, and when I tried to help them I felt zero support from my manager and boss. \n\nEven on my last day of work, a customer yelled at my coworker. I couldn't really help because I wasn't sure what to do. My manager doesn't work on that day and my boss was no where to be found. When the customer left, turns out my boss hid from them and came out afterwards. I really wish when we face a rude customer, we should support each other and face them together. But it's one person handling and everyone else doing other things. \n\nAt least my coworkers are nice to me. The one who got yelled at actually told me she'll handle the rude customer. Because she saw me talking to them and they were a bit irritated so my coworker took over. I felt bad but also glad she was able to handle a rude customer, because I don't think I could do it. She's always calm in these bad situations. I thanked my coworkers on my last day, some of them gave me snacks and hugged me during closing hours. \n\nI finally got hired without any help in retail and is currently training. The people there are pretty nice and helpful so I hope I'll like that job. Thank you to all the Redditors reading my posts, the comments were quite helpful.

I know it's March and this is when these things happen. But we JUUUUUST finished Mardi Gras, and our extended stay crews still have their scent in the building. I feel like we barely had time to breathe!\n\nThe kids, as much as I hate to admit it, have not been too terrible. There is a singular group of boys I've had to yell at multiple times for running in the halls and screaming. But the rest of the kids, not so much.\n\nI *have* had to reprimand a concerning amount of adults though. These are the adults who I assume are associated with the kids.  Our lobby is not small, but it's certainly not big enough to set up camp at our snack table with 12 people and 2 cases of beer. Take your loud gathering elsewhere!\n\nAs far as this wedding, I don't know WHO is promising these mofos early check-ins, but they need to be stopped. Check in is at 4pm. Why are you in my face at 11:30 am?! And why do you think hyperventilating about how you can't be late is going to magically make this room available any faster? **BOOK YOUR FKN ROOM A DAY IN ADVANCE.**\n\nThere was a lady who called earlier to see if she could check-in early. I told her very plainly that I didn't have any rooms available just yet for check in. She short circuited. *\"Well, I'm with the wedding party...\"* Her tone was more like *\"No no, you don't understand... let me speak slower for you!\"*\n\nIt's not hard to do research on the place you're going to.

Randy is around my height (six foot two), and at minimum weighs in at four hundred pounds. Randy has extended his stay by a day, every day he's been here. Randy likes to sit in the lobby and talk loudly to nobody about how they're not gonna be able to beat him and how he'll show them and how he's gonna kill them if they try and touch him again. \n\nRandy is mentally unwell, but usually not troublesome for us. Just let him run off steam for a couple minutes, let him buy his Starbucks in a bottle, and he'll go back to his room and stay there all day. \n\nToday, I was working a 12p-6p shift. Ar 12:07 PM, Randy approached the desk. He grabbed a sandwich, a Starbucks, and a fruit cup from our market area, paid for them, and then immediately started talking to me, as if we'd already been engaged in conversation.\n\n\"So what would you do in my situation, dude?\"\n\nI said, \"What situation?\"\n\n\"Well, you know. I got these fucking, these magnets in my head and in my collarbone, dude, and they're using them to attack me. They're using, all my life, all my life, my grandmother is very rich, and she's using magnets to attack me man, she didn't want me playing soccer in high school so she used magnets to break my legs all the time, and she and her friends have like five hundred million dollars, so they're untouchable, and they use these magnets to attack me all the time, and the doctors can't help because they've been paying them off, and even here!--even you, kthrnhpbrnnkdbsmnt, even you, I know that you've been trying to kill me because they paid you to, I know you've been magnetically trying to--to use the magnets to magnet dust into my throat to kill me, man, but I'm not mad, dude, I know they're paying you a lot to do that and you gotta make ends meet, but if you were me, what would you do, man? Because they've got the --CITY-- PD, and they've framed me, because of my extremely small penis, they've framed me for molesting children and they're trying to arrest me right now, but the police are little bitches and I dare them to come here and try to take me, I fucking dare them, I'll kill them all with my bare hands I swear to fucking god, I'll fucking kill them if they don't let me see my brothers man, I just wanna see my brother, I'm gonna go out in the woods and call the cops and tell them where I am and that if they come there I'll kill them, and when they come I'll kill them until they let me see my brother, but man, you don't even know, I've got this neural implant in my skull, and it's attached to the cameras that they put in my eyes, and I've been spying, my grandmother is preparing, using me, she broke my foot when I was a teenager by magnetically stealing my, she used magnets to steal my shoe to break my foot.\"\n\nHere I interjected, \"If it's the magnets, maybe go to a place with no cell phone signal.

I'm literally leaking radiation, I've been to all these doctors, they say I'm schizophrenic and they give me pills to pop but the pills don't make me feel smart. They make me feel stupid and depressed and they make me defenseless against them. I'm trying to resist the forces of evil but they're targeting me all the time, with the magnets.\"\n\n\"Magnets bad, yup.\"\n\n\"But you're using them to try and kill me, dude.\"\n\n\"Gotta pay the bills, I guess.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I'm not mad at you about it, kthrnhpbrnnkdbsmnt, I know you don't want to kill me, they're paying you, forcing you.\"\n\nThen he wandered away to drink his starbucks and converse with his demons, out loud, in the lobby.

Because our system doesn't charge when you extend, only when you check in and out, it had been unnoticed. But Randy owed us seven hundred dollars. And my manager was gonna get it. \n\nOf course, she was gonna talk to him about it, despite warnings from everyone else there that he was the size of a bull elephant and clearly unwell, while she's five nothing, weighs a hundred and ten if she's soaking wet. She agreed to have 911 pulled up to call in case it went south, then she called everyone else in the building working down to the lobby in case she needed backup. I was standing by ready to call the cops since I can't fight with a broken arm, and the other FDA working had quietly retrieved Bertha the Bitch Beater, the crowbar we use to break into rooms that guests accidentally deadbolt behind themselves. \n\nMy manager went and sat at his table and started gently talking to him. While they were talking, he started getting loud, and she just raised her hand up and slowly lowered it and he got quiet again. Then, after about ten minutes, she walked up to the front desk with him following her. \n\n\"Hey man, sorry I started telling you all that. I'll check out tomorrow, don't worry, I won't be a bother anymore. Thanks for listening. See you later when you try to kill me.\"\n\nThen he stumped away back to his room. My manager informed me that Randy, fearing government surveillance, had locked his card, but he was gonna unlock it in 30 minutes once he was able to hide from the window. He did, and I extracted the payment, and didn't see him again until I left.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678502594.0},{"title":"Creepy Woman was stalking one of the guests at the Hotel I work at.","author":"robertomarxo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11o5e7v\/creepy_woman_was_stalking_one_of_the_guests_at\/","text":"For reference, this happened back in the summer of 2022. I work the 3-11 shift at the hotel, so I deal with most if not all of the check ins. \n\nThis particular guest checked in at around 6:00-7:00. For privacy reasons, I\u2019ll call him Jack. At check in, everything went smoothly. Jack seemed like a nice, albeit quiet man. Before he went down to his room, he said something that my coworker and I should have taken as a forewarning for the rest of the night: He asked us to not transfer any calls to his room.\n\nLater, a woman comes in, asking if Jack is there. My coworker tells her that as per policy, we can\u2019t tell her that. She thanks him and leaves. Shortly after, a phone call comes in, this time from a *slightly* different sounding woman who claimed to be from Dominos Pizza, asking for a room number for Jack so she could bring up his pizza. She sounded different enough and we were busy enough that we didn\u2019t think much of it and gave the number to her and went about checking other guests in. \n\nAbout 5 minutes later, we receive a call from Jack, asking to be moved since we have out his location. We realize what we did, apologize, and promptly move him.\n\nMaybe 15 minutes passes before we receive another call, this time from the woman. She asks to be transferred to Jack\u2019s room. In the interest of rectifying the mistake we had made, I tell her that no one under that name is staying here. She tells me that that\u2019s bullshit, as we had just transferred her there. This was when we figured out that the  \u201cDominos\u201d woman and this woman were the same person. She\u2019s correct, obviously, but I\u2019m not going to tell her that. Instead I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know what to tell you ma\u2019am.\u201d She then asks for a manager. The thing is, my managers are only there from 8-4ish during the week. So there isn\u2019t currently a manager in for her to talk to. \n\nI tell her this and she gets PISSED. She started to cuss me out and threatened to call corporate on me. In response I say, \u201cYou can do that if you want ma\u2019am, have a nice night.\u201d And promptly hung up on her. \n\nI would have thought that\u2019d have been the end of it but I was sorely mistaken. 5 minutes later I pick up the phone and she\u2019s there again, yelling and swearing and generally being terrible. I immediately hung up again. \n\nMy coworker calls me to the back office and shows me the cameras. On them, we can clearly see the woman and an unknown man trying exterior doors around the wing where Jack\u2019s room was. \n\nWe have a can of pepper spray behind the desk so we grab it and walk down to the halls, but by the time we got there, they were already gone. When we get back up to the desk, we notice a silver SUV with the woman and the man in it lurking about in front of the building. They did this for about an hour, and finally left just as we were about to call the cops.\n\nDefinitely one of the weirdest things to ever happen to me while working at the hotel.\n\nTLDR: crazy woman stalks a guest and threatens me when I try to hide that he\u2019s here. Tries to break into the building when she can\u2019t get us to help her and loiters outside for almost and hour afterwards.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678493500.0},{"title":"Our Resort Was Attacked by Pirates Last Night.

We have a beautiful protected cove and a marina here. Last night, we were attacked by pirates.\n\nThere is a boat I've seen in our harbour a few times. It's about a 72 foot sailboat and it's NOT in good condition. There are tarps and junk all over it and it flies a pirate flag. Apparently, it has no insurance so it isn't allowed to tie up on any of our docks. Also, the owner and his friends are a bit sketchy, so they aren't allowed on the resort grounds either.\n\nLast night, whiskey was the drink of choice on the pirate ship.\n\nTwo men from the boat stole a neighbouring dingy and rowed ashore, onto the beach in the cove just south of ours. They came in through the dark, tried to wake up a girl they knew on the docks, but she wasn't having any of it and she told them to leave. They then came to our front desk at our guest reception in the Lodge, which was closed at the time. When guest reception is closed, there is just a sign on the counter with an emergency number to call if a guest needs assistance in the night.\n\nWe sell cigarettes from the front desk and they are kept in a locked drawer behind the counter, along with the float ($600). Last night, these pirates, drunk on whiskey, broke into the drawer and stole the float and all the cigarettes. They did this directly on camera, which they even looked at while performing this plundering of our treasure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlas, as is the fate of most dumb, drunk pirates, they were arrested today in their beds, woken from their slumbering hangovers, the loot piled on their bedside table.\n\nNot a good time to be a pirate.\n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678414519.0},{"title":"Uhh...

I politely let him know that our lobby was closed (closes at 10PM), but he could sit there for a bit. He sat there for 20 minutes, even turning his phone on max and listening to FOX News or something. I was going to give him 30 minutes, which I felt was more than reasonable, until he got up and approached my desk.\n\n\"You know, sometimes you need to bend the rules for guests. I didn't want to disturb anyone in my room.\"\n\nI almost told him that I *did* bend the rules for him, but I just said \"I'm just following rules.\"\n\nHe just walked away. I was left scratching my head. Everyone wants the rules to be followed until it comes to them.

Steph sees me and basically says hallelujah. Her night has been a disaster because, well, Fosse has this neat little feature where, if you\u2019re trying to mark a room as dirty but you forget to type in the specific room number, it goes ahead and assumes you want every single available room in the hotel to be marked dirty. No undo button. No warning box popup that says, \u2018yo, you\u2019re about to set every room as dirty, with no undo option.\u2019 Nope. Fosse is the Ron Burgundy of property management systems. It follows whatever order you put through, no questions asked.\n\nSo that\u2019s where we\u2019re at when I walk in. Steph has been on the phone with an operations supervisor, a housekeeping supervisor, and texting with the front desk manager. Apparently, none of these people are familiar with the room status tracking report, because it looks like she\u2019s been video chatting with the supervisors and trying to have them recall from memory which rooms were vacant, then she\u2019s running off to check some of them individually when she gets the chance. \n\nYou would think we just need to make sure a room isn\u2019t occupied, and that would mean it\u2019s clean, even though the system thinks it\u2019s dirty. But when you have a housekeeping department that drops some twenty rooms every weekday, there\u2019s a few landmines out there\u2026\n\n(They\u2019re doing the best they can. If anyone in Chicago wants to work as a housekeeper, PM me.)\n\nOkay, no big deal. I show her there\u2019s a room status tracking report, and how to read through it and flip the rooms back. It\u2019s a bit difficult to read, but as long as we don\u2019t have a line of guests out the door, we can get this straightened out. We usually only have five remaining arrivals at this hour on a weekday.\n\nOh God, we have fifteen arrivals. And about five of them walk through the door all at once. WTF!?\n\n\u201cJust give me one minute, sir. Our system is a little out of whack,\u201d I say, as guests watch me dig through a report just to find them available rooms. Okay, so every checkin is going to take a couple minutes extra. And I just have to hope I don\u2019t misread something and checkin a few guests to some dirty rooms. Not that bad of a night right?\n\nPhone rings. A pissed off sounding guy wants to speak to a manager.\n\nLol. Even though this hotel has 300 rooms, we haven\u2019t had a manager on the graveyard shift since before Covid. Well, he says, dealing with us has been ridiculous and he\u2019s sending his boyfriend over to get those two lost phones and wallet, and they\u2019re bringing the cops with them.\n\nWut?\n\nAs I\u2019m asking questions, Steph overhears and says, \u201cOh I\u2019ll have to tell you about him. He\u2019s gonna have to deal with a manager.\u201d\n\nI tell the guy I\u2019m not a manager, but I can try to help out his situation once I figure out what\u2019s going on. He says \u201cI\u2019ll hold.\u201d\n\nHope you\u2019re okay with holding for five minutes, buddy, because you\u2019re low priority right now.\n\nEventually Steph gets the chance to tell me two phones and a wallet were found in the parking garage lobby\u2014technically not even the hotel\u2019s property, but I guess our restaurant manager decided to make these items into a problem for the hotel to deal with. Earlier these two guys showed up to the hotel wanting to get the phones and wallet back, but they look nothing like the guy on the ID. They say he\u2019s in the car out front. Okay\u2026so have him come in and get his stuff? They disappear, and a while later the \u201cguy who lost his stuff\u201d is calling from a neighboring hotel claiming he sent his friends to get his stuff. From various phone calls and different sketchy people showing up to the hotel to claim the stuff, no one can give us the name, address, or date of birth of the guy on the ID. So\u2026go away until the guy on the ID comes to get it.\n\nA guy shows up to ask me for the phones and wallet just as I\u2019m done flipping the rooms I\u2019ll need for the rest of the night. He says the police are on their way.\n\nI smile and say, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nGood. I can ask them to remove you for trespassing if you cause a scene. \n\nBut of course, it\u2019s Chicago PD, and they\u2019re not gonna show up for another hour. I sit in the office out of sight, until eventually he gives up and disappears. I have no idea if these guys are just trying to recover their friend\u2019s stuff or this is a full-out case of identity theft. But you would think, if the guy who owns the wallet is apparently staying in the hotel a couple blocks away, he would have come in by now\u2026\n\nThe next day an operations manager showed me that you can print the room status tracking report and organize by name of who made the changes. So all the changes you\u2019re looking for would be lumped together. That\u2019s your best option, lest you risk flipping dropped rooms over to vacant-ready. She turned the wallet and phones over to the cops. Not our problem anymore. Never should have been.\n\nIf any other night auditor had walked in to work that night, the whole place would have been chaos for hours. Turns out, knowing how to print reports can save you a massive headache. \n\nJust another day of saving the Courtyard.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678438953.0},{"title":"Man was upset he had to wait five minutes for valet, asked me to cancel his reservation, which I did.

This is one of my favorite stories because the karmic justice was hilarious at the end. I deal with a batshit amount of problems because I work at a 4 star luxury hotel that is also in the middle of a downtown city and connected to a convention center. I literally deal with everyone, from the homeless to celebrities. This isn't my \"craziest\" story - but the funniest when it comes to instant karma. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo most of my problems usually happen right at the beginning of my shift. It's when late check-ins start finishing up but only with the drunk and the rowdy, and the occasional late flight. This man was of the drunk and rowdy nature. He was middle aged, looked like your typical Marvel fan from the shorts, the shirt, the beard and the glasses. Reeked of neckbeard. (We all know the type, I'm a nerd too but the kind that showers and has friends and boundaries) I don't work alone but was alone at the front desk (26F) and he comes up to complain. He is checking in and stating valet wasn't there and he has been waiting 20 minutes. I call valet and find out he has only been waiting 5, and assure him they are finishing up with a couple guests and will park his car. He would not let it go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe starts going on a rant about my terrible customer service, how there has to be SOMETHING I should do for him to make up for this. How completely unacceptable he had to wait at all at a luxury hotel for the valet, and thought that was the whole point of us being luxury. Clearly hasn't been to a hotel in general, nevermind a nice one. I told him I talked to the valet and it's normal for people to have to wait for others who were there first, there was nothing I could do. It wasn't even an amount of time that I could fake being sympathetic for. He was clearly just being an ass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe then keeps demanding an explanation from me as to why he was waiting, now trying to tell me I am lying to him and they were clearly sleeping or on break. He then tells me to just cancel his reservation. I said ok! The valet was ready for you but if this isn't what you wanted I will go ahead and cancel. So I do, and hand him the printed cancellation. Still won't leave. Now he's standing at the front desk staring me down, and repeatedly asking me why he had to wait for valet and to admit they were sleeping. I tell him he no longer has a reservation with us and I will call security to escort him out as he is no longer a guest. He says fine. So I call security and he still won't leave, starts yelling at them that he won't leave unless we call the cops. Man LITERALLY asked us to call the cops on him. He then looked at me and was like \"You're not gonna win this you know\" (me not even knowing there was something to \"win\" here) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo cops get there, they come up to me just to ask what's going on and feel bad cuz they know the dude is just being a dick. I tell him he literally told us to call the cops to make him leave. Cops go deal with him, they tell him not only are we not reinstating his reservation which I guess he was trying to get them to do, but he had to call an uber home and had to abandon his car at the hotel because he was too drunk to drive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cops literally made him call the uber in front of them and get into it and watch him leave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this dude clearly had some sort of power struggle thing going on, or rough shit at home. Idk and frankly don't care. He thought he could just pick on some random hotel worker and instead got the biggest walk of shame I have seen and also had to pay for an uber, a cancellation fee, and god knows what else to get his car back.

Not a typical rant about what The Kids These Days Are Wearing, or anything like that, as I am a child of the 80s, and have seen some outlandish attire in my day. Buttercup is wearing her usual radiant sheen of sparkles and rainbows, with some ribbons in her mane, should anyone need cheering up. This is a long one, so you may want to pull up a chair if you're going to be brushing her.\n\nOur story begins one fine night on your humble narrator's shift. I've completed the audit and am listening to some lovely jazz streaming on my laptop when in walks a young woman. She has a reservation, and would like to check in please. \n\nI sigh inwardly, and tell her that with it being *thirteen hours* before check-in time,  she will need to have an additional night added to her stay. Surprisingly she is okay with this, unlike *most* post-audit arrivals who will whine and wheedle to try and get an extra night for free. Very well, I start in on the paperwork.\n\nAs I'm printing off the registration card, in walks her boyfriend\/baby daddy\/etc. This fine gentleman is wearing a purple bathrobe and an unsettling grin. Think Gomez Addams (Astin, not Julia), but without the charm. Before anyone asks, I was unable to tell if that was *all* he was wearing, and I trust that you will understand my lack of curiosity on the matter. While certainly unusual, it's not awful enough to warrant more than a raised eyebrow.\n\nIn any case, the guy is giving off a 'vibe'. Nothing noticably off or unusual besides the bathrobe, but he's setting off a *lot* of alarm bells. I can see why he sent his girlfriend\/baby momma\/etc. in to get the room rather than come in himself, as she could present herself as a respectable and normal member of the general public. Keys are handed over, with the fervent hopes that there wouldn't be any issues.\n\nThat's when grandma walks in, pushing a stroller with one young child, while carrying another.\n\nGentle readers, this now makes *five* people (two of them admittedly quite small) in that room. Which room, you might ask? Our Two *Twin* Bed Accessable. The sort of room that will really only accomodate two people comfortably.  They've undoubtedly selected this room because it's cheaper than the Two Queen Bed rooms, but they'll pay for it in lost sleep. I am genuinely surprised when they don't come back to change rooms.\n\nAhh, but our story doesn't end there.\n\nThat was all I saw of the family until the next night, but my coworkers filled me in. At some point the grandmother had left, presumably to find a bed of her own. The gentleman in the bathrobe had been acting increasingly 'off' all day long. He was apparently (and thankfully) wearing shorts under the robe, as he'd been wandering around with it open during the day. *Classy.* Never wore anything else. By the time I arrived, he had been rather persistently chatting up my coworker while she tried to diplomatically extricate herself from the conversation.\n\n\"Oh look, there's Skwrl. He can help you with any thing else that you need tonight.\"\n\n\"Hey, no problem. Can I walk you out to your car..?\" \n\n\"Nooo no no.. that's fine, I'm fine, it's okay, really...\" She then ducks into the back office to clock out, \"SO glad you're here... He's been bothering me for the past three hours. He was having a bad time of it, but some coffee and a banana seem to be helping. Still, he was starting to get creepy.\"\n\n\"He's got a girlfriend and two kids...\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know, he mentioned them.\"\n\nWith that, my coworker left, and Bathrobe Guy followed, though only as far as the door, watching forlornly as she drove away. I stayed in the back, hoping that now that his object of fixation had left, and with nobody else to chat with, he might get bored and head back to his room. \n\nThis was unfortunately not the case, as without someone else to talk to, he began pacing around the lobby, muttering to himself. Being in the back office I didn't hear all of it, but it started out as random mutterings and progressed rather quickly to disjointed word salad. Not sure if he was on something, off something, having a mental health issue, or all three with fries and a drink, but he was definitely no longer fully on this planet.\n\n\"mumblemumble ... they think I'm Jesus but I'm *not*, have to keep telling people I'm not Jesus.. (author's note: ain't nobody mistaking him for Jesus) Mumblemumble ... she expects me to eat *canned* food, what's up with that mumble...\" You get the idea. After about half an hour of this, he shambles back to his room. I breathe a sigh of relief. Maybe he'll go to sleep now.\n\nGentle readers, he did *not* go to sleep.\n\nAbout a half hour later, I am jolted from my net browsing by a shout down the hall. Oh joy, it's Bathrobe Guy yelling at his girlfriend as she tries to bundle both her small children down the hall.\n\n\"I AIN'T LETTING YOU TAKE MY KIDS!!\"\n\nPapa Bear Mode Engaged.\n\nI bang out of back office, give him a glare of absolute murder and growl, \"People are trying to sleep. Be. Quiet.\"\n\n\"But she's taking my kids!!\"\n\n\"Then you will resolve it *quietly*, like adults, and not wake up the entire hotel.\" My secret plan seems to have worked; while he's focusing on me and trying to get me on his side, she's getting the infants out to the car. That said, I'm staying close enough that if he lays a finger on her, I'm ready to snap him in half. He has angered the Skwrl.\n\nHe does follow her out to the car, shouting at her that he's calling the cops on her. He is very noticably *not* doing that, bluffing to try and get her to listen to him. I tell him that if he doesn't keep quiet *I* will be the one calling the police. His girlfriend has been completely ignoring him the entire time, and once she has the kids secured, drives off into the night, leaving Bathrobe Guy fuming and cursing. Quietly.\n\nI head back inside. He follows a short time after. Seems he doesn't have his key. I'm *really* tempted to tell him that since his name's not on the registration, I can't give him one... but I want this guy out of my lobby. I fix him with a stern glare, \"Will you be *quiet*?\" \"... yes.\" \"Then here is your card. Go to bed.\" WIth that, he slinks off to his room, never to trouble your humble narrator again. \n\nHe left the next morning, without further incident.\n\nSo there we have the saga of Bathrobe Guy. Here's hoping he gets whatever help he needs.

I went straight from work still wearing my work clothes, but took off my nametag and anything that states my hotel on it; basically, I was wearing my checkered long-sleeve shirt and black pants (yes, this is important). I had a great time, downing shots, drinking beer, and then having my designated driver roommate drive me and my car back to our apartment.\n\nTwo days later, I get into work and my boss is there. Felt it kind of odd because she is usually gone before afternoon shift gets there at 3pm. She doesn't look mad, more concerned and confused. I clock in and she asks to speak to me. Again, she didn't sound mad, so I was more wondering if everything is ok. She pulls up our review forums and shows me the most recent review. It reads something like \"I saw the front desk agent getting drunk with friends, downing shots, and unable to walk. Very poor choice of staff.\" I recognized the name as someone I checked in the day I went to the bar.\n\nObviously, my boss had to ask me some questions to follow up, with the biggest one being \"were you drinking at work.\" I say that I was of course not and I just went to the bar after my shift two days ago. I explained that I made sure my nametag was off and there was nothing that said our hotel on it, but still had the same work clothes I had on that shift.\n\nPer requirement, she reached out to the guest for more info and the guest explained that they recognized me at the same bar with my work clothes, beard, and my long hair.

A blonde forty-something woman comes down, tugging a coat over her arms. I greet her with a smile. \"Good morning!\"\n\nThe woman looks at me and rolls her eyes, asking me what time it was. I tell her the time, and she grumbles, \"I got here at 8PM and I'm awake at 1AM, ask me again if I'm having a good morning.\"\n\nAh, so we have a tired, grumpy guest. Well, it is early, and I am on a night schedule, so it's no biggy. Doesn't bother me. I just laugh it off and mention how tired she must be, hoping to smooth over her attitude with some positivity. But we only went downhill. She mentioned something about the hotel making a lot of money off of being greedy. I was a little shocked by this, since that wasn't the usual dialogue my NPC brain had to use. \"Winter time is a slow season, so we-\"\n\n\"Are you the owner?\"\n\nI blinked a few times. \"No, I'm night audit.\"\n\n\"Then don't say 'we'. You are not 'we'. You don't own this building.\" She banged on the fireplace a few times before tightening her coat around her. I thought for a few seconds about how odd this interaction was. If anything, this was a crackhead encounter, but since she came from the elevator, she had to be a guest. The side doors were locked, and she mentioned paying for the room, so this had to be someone staying here intentionally. She was already being extremely hostile, and since I work alone, I needed some information off of her.\n\n\"What's your room number?\" I asked, hovering my fingers over the keyboard. If anything, this sounded like a complaint in the making, and after one of my last stories about a flood of complaints, I wanted to give my boss a heads-up about a future issue so he could address it ASAP. I mean, he told us our location gets fined $150 per complaint. But the woman told me she didn't know her room number. I raised a brow. \"I can use your last name, then.\"\n\n\"I don't want to give you that.\" She looked me dead in the eyes. I knew this was about to turn into an issue.\n\n\"Then you need to leave,\" I told her, giving her the option to either return to her room or go outside. I really did not know how to continue. I was sure she was a guest, so I wouldn't have said anything if she went back in the elevator, but in the lobby fighting me was one place she shouldn't be. If she went outside, I'd ask her her name again to verify her identity. I was getting a little worried about this confrontation. however.\n\nShe pulled a key out of her pocket. \"You don't get to fucking tell me what to do. I have a room here.\" *Ah, so she does have a room here*. Except now it escalated, and she was fast approaching me. There is no security guard, and I was starting to feel afraid. I told her if she did not leave the lobby, I would have to have police come and remove her. \"I will do what I fucking want. Call the police. See if I care.\"\n\nMy hands were shaking. She was right up in my face. I didn't feel like I could further deescalate the situation, and she was obviously not acting right. I have never, not in my life, had a confrontation like this. I grab my phone and my keys and head into my safe zone, the laundry room, to remove myself from the situation and calm us both down. Yes, I was still going to call the non-emergency number because I needed some assistance in figuring out what to do with her (no training on situations like this). I mostly hoped she'd scamper off to her room, but she stayed out in the lobby, ringing the service bell, trying to get me to come back out and face her.\n\nI whispered into my phone so I wouldn't anger that woman further, watching her from the front lobby cameras. The woman left the bell and began to rummage through our Uber cards, yelling about how I had \"white privilege\" and I was a \"white bitch.\" Up until this time, I assumed she was a white woman, too, but she may have been white passing, I don't know, nor does it matter, it's just part of the story that will come back up later. I watched as she eventually exclaimed she doesn't have to wait here for this, and she began to walk back to the elevators, when she stopped and rushed to the office door to get to me. She pulled on the lock, trying to break in, and this is when I started to freak out to dispatch. I begged dispatch for help and to send someone right away. Tears started flooding down my face. I have never had someone do this before. I was scared, because she may try to hop the counter, which is really low in one area, and the laundry door does not lock. Dispatch told me an officer was in the area and to stay where I was.\n\nThe woman abandoned the door and went to the low area of the front desk. I held my breath. The laundry room door was ajar, and I was hiding in a corner, but she could still see in to the room (not at me). \"I'll stuff you in that fucking washing machine,\" she said, and I repeated it to the lady on the phone. Thankfully, the crazy woman decided against hopping the counter, and I watched as she went to our north facing door. She put her hood on, held the door open for a cigarette (because why wouldn't she keep breaking the rules), and... dispatch hung up on me. I didn't realize she did and kept talking on the phone. I've never had them hang up on me before, but oh well. At that time, I could tell the crackhead was talking to someone, since her arms were flying all over the place. I call my partner at the time for comfort, then the police came to find me.\n\nI tell him the story above, reminding him I also have cameras to back me up. He asks me what I want to do, and I tell him she has got to go. The officer advises me against it, which I thought was odd, but I told him that I am the only one on site, and she was no longer welcome. He says okay, and she is brought through the front door. If looks could kill, you guys wouldn't have this story. Anyways, I'm finally given her name and room number, and she\/her husband are the second highest shiny you can be for my brand, so I am absolutely shocked by her behavior. It's under her husband's name, whom the officer says is in the room with her. Apparently he was a swell guy, sleeping peacefully until the cops came knocking on his door. He didn't seem surprised that his wife got him kicked out of the hotel at 2 in the morning. He has a Nigerian first and last name, and the cops told me the woman was ranting and raving about how racist I was. I, again, told the police I have cameras to back me up, and they told me they believed me, regardless. This was the second white woman this month that took it upon herself to call our front desk racist to their husbands without us ever seeing said husband. I have no explanations for it, but I have a feeling that's why the cops didn't want to kick them out. They were really trying to guide me to not to give 'em the boot. That's really the only explanation I have.\n\nThe cops tell me to go back into the laundry room while the couple wheels their luggage through the lobby and into their vehicle. They were nice enough to wait while the crackhead de-iced the windshield, and one of the officers chuckled as the woman flipped them off. We talked about her testimony, how it was absurd, and the high probability that she was high on something. I try getting a hold of my boss to see if I did everything right, but he has told me in the past that he turns his phone off at night, so no luck. I'm really scared about how the night went, but I won't see that couple again. They're on their way back to North Carolina or Connecticut, and I doubt they'd want to stay here again and receive my poor service.\n\nI'm scared to think about what that woman would have done to me if the door wasn't locked, or if she jumped the counter. She was really twisting that handle. Do I think she would have put me in the washing machine? No, but I've never been beat up before, so I don't really know how to defend myself. I left the lobby to deescalate the situation, but she wanted more. I hope my boss does not refund her. I would like to know if I can contact the franchise and report her somehow, since the account is such a high shiny (under her husband's name). If it helps, my franchise starts with an \"M\", and it is definitely the one that first popped in your head. I also think this may be the beginning of the end of my job as a NA, at least at this location. I really need to work somewhere with a security guard and a functioning front door that locks. I know there's crazy people everywhere, but there's only so much I can do.\n\nTLDR; I say good morning to a guest and she tries to fucking jump me lol\n\n\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678363037.0},{"title":"Barefoot guest snores in the lobby, DJs at the FD, complains about the size of his daughter\u2019s boobs, asks about local brothels, and gets hit (in the face) with karmic justice.","author":"WoeYou","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11mvkp1\/barefoot_guest_snores_in_the_lobby_djs_at_the_fd\/","text":"FDA (f, 21) here at a small hotel.  This happened several months ago. Four university professors (all middle aged\/older men) were staying with us, having been invited as guests to one of the local unis here. \n\nThey were pretty problem-free at first, when i checked them in on my day shift. I work the nights as well and happened to have two, during their stay. \n\nThese were some of the most bizarre nights i have had to this day, thanks to ONE of these distinguished professors, in particular. \n\nMy colleague has mentioned to me, something about one of the men being a bother, but didn\u2019t really go into detail. The details\u2026 I found out for myself. \n\nOn the first night, I learnt that this guy never sleeps\u2026 and I mean, never. He came down to the lobby at 1am, strolled to my desk from the elevator - barefoot, not even wearing socks. \n\nThis left me in initial shock. I recovered when he asked for slippers, which, unfortunately, we do not provide. Then asked for a coffee. He starts complaining how he cant sleep, has insomnia, yada yada. Bro\u2026 youre drinking espressos at night. \n\nAnyway, I try to look busy on the pc but he settles down at my counter, instead of sitting at the lounge area. He asks for a pen and paper, scibbles a few things down, some crude drawings of shapes and makes me guess what the drawings are (they were everyday items, drawn from a weird perspective, if anyone knows this game). \n\nEverytime i reluctantly looked over and guessed, he urged me to guess one more\u2026 and praised me when i got it right, like I was a trained dog or smtg. \n\nI was bored at first, thinking id entertain this for a while, out of sheer goodwill, given maybe this was some harmless quirky professor behavior\u2026 it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe more time passed, the less this man acted like someone fit to teach others\u2026 not even kindergardeners.\n\nHe began to muse that I remind him of a female singer from some old rock band (idr the name) then it came to him and he pulled up a yt live performance on his phone he started BLASTING on full volume in the lobby. \n\nI tried pacifying this activity and send him off but everytime, he started a pity party about his inabllity to sleep, his horribly tragic life and asked for another coffee. \n\nSo he began to tell the tale of his family (accompanied by photos from his phone): his marriage with his wife and their daughter ( around my age). \n\nTragically, he was oh so worried his daughter would never find a boyfriend, because\u2026 because\u2026\n\nand here he motioned in circles with two hands around his chest area\u2026 \n\nhe said that I should understand. \n\nI said i have no idea what hes talking about. \n\nI, of course, had put 2 and 2 together, but feigned ignorance due to the sheer horror of what was being implied by the poor girl\u2019s OWN FATHER.  \n\nHe unfortunately spelled it out for me: his daughter\u2019s breasts were too small to find attractive. He said that. And this worried him so very much. As was his fatherly duty. \n\nYeah. So here, as you can imagine, I was getting really, really uncomfortable and was beginning to show him hostility, on purpose, hoping he would feel bummed out and leave. \n\nI said that I believed the size of his daughters boobs has nothing to do with him, which he ignored and instead asked for advice on how to invite \u201ca [insert my country\u2019s name] girl\u201d to coffee. \n\nI was like\u2026 sir, did you not say you were married? Now\u2026 and I recall this with great pain\u2026he took this as me being JEALOUS and accused me of being interested in him, to remember he has a wife (she was mentioned mere minutes ago). \n\nThen he went on to ask if I knew any brothels in the area, and whether it was legal here. (The amount of times Ive been asked this question by guests is staggering\u2026) \n\n And before you ask why didnt I call security, its because we dont have any and I was the only person on the property. \n\nThe dam broke lose and he was passionately raving about loving his wife very much, with his heart, but needing to meet girls for coffee and have an intelectual discussion ONLY, to appease his brain. Because those were two separate matters, and in no way did that dimish the love his heart had for his wife. \n\nOkay???! Okay. \n\nThis guy made one more incredibly strange attempt, which was that he insisted on teaching me how to use Excel and tried coming BEHIND MY DESK to my computer. \n\nThat was my last straw and i really did blow up on him and he finally dragged himself away to the elevator. At 5am. \n\nAt the beginning of my next night shift, i noticed his coworkers were looking at me apologetically, each time they passed the desk and even tried dragging him away, when he approached me again. \n\nI was nonetheless bracing myself for another horrific night, not knowing, that karma was indeed real, and it was on my side.\n\nI waited with bated breath, as he passed by couple of times. Yet, not once stopping to torture me. \n\nHe DID, however, fall asleep at one of the lobby arm chairs, and began to snore loudly. This was beyond embarassing for the hotel, as it was a chair close to the front desk, which meant anyone who entered or exited passed by this snoring old man. \n\nAnd I found it, quite frankly, beyond my paycheck to wake him up. I would have poked him awake with a long stick, If i had one. \n\nAnd it was quite late, not many guests, so I waited and soon, his collegues came to collect him, apologizing to me. \n\nAround 1 am, he came down again and asked me, gloriously, to call him a taxi to the city center. I rejoiced, he was going out and I would most likely be free of him most of the night. \n\nI was in bliss, for about two hours. \n\nThen the front door bell rang, and I saw police officers on the camera, standing outside the door. \n\nThen I saw, they were holding up a third person\u2026 my lovely guest. \n\nWith blood running down his forehead and a black eye. \n\nI confirmed his identity. Apparently, he was attacked at the train station, and robbed of his wallet and other belongings. He had recieved some light first aid treatment on the spot.\n\nYou might call me a bad person, but in this very moment I felt pure, unbridled joy. It felt like universe did have a karmic balance and it has been restored. \n\nThe officers said he was drunk. He was probably out taunting someone he shouldnt have and he needs to just sleep it off.\n\nHis collegues came down around an hour later, saying his injuries were hurting and i helped them contact the ER, which they came back from untreated, because, his wallet being stolen, he didnt have any form of ID with him and they refused him treatment. Idk how that works\u2026\n\nThis fact earned me an earful from his coworkers, who were genuinely worried about him. And they were returning to their country and now had a problem because this guy got his Visa stolen along with the other things.\n\nHowever, that was no longer my problem because I finally\u2026 finally clocked tf out.

I'm not exaggerating when I say we've shared the best and worst times with this crew. \n\nEveryone--the hotel staff and the crew themselves--got progressively sadder as their checkout date encroached. I wasn't there on the day of their checkout, which is good because I would have been an ugly crying mess! But I do have an awesome picture of all of them on their ship (which I need to get blown up and framed). \n\nThey haven't taken the ship yet.

There are *hundreds* of issues with the ship that make it incredibly stupid to move it even a few feet.

Yeah, that\u2019s what I thought too. \n\nEnter: Gary. Gary was staying at the hotel with his teenaged son for the weekend. They had a weekend trip planned and were in the area, so they needed a place to stay. Gary was a pretty unassuming guy at first glance, and his son had that impatient silence about him that most teenagers have. \n\nEverything is a-okay. I come in the next morning to relieve the night auditor, and Gary is standing at the desk talking passionately about something. The night auditor made eye contact with me in a way that said \u201cpls help me.\u201d I silently giggled and continued into the office where I overheard Gary say something about sun rotation and Earth as a plane. I assumed he was poking fun at the Flat Earth idea and joking about the whole thing.\n\nFive minutes later, the night auditor walked back into the office with a handful of papers and stared at me unblinkingly as he ripped them up and shoved them in the garbage. He gave me report and then told me \u2018good luck\u2019 as he left.\n\nI thought that that was it. Seems that Gary had gone up to his room, so I thought nothing of it. Ten minutes later, he comes back down to the desk and introduced himself. Uh, hi? Nice to meet you I guess? I didn\u2019t know what he expected me to say, honestly. Turns out, I didn\u2019t have to say anything. He could speak more than enough for both of us. He began to talk about the basis of the Flat Earth theory, and I laughed about it and shook my head a bit. I thought he was joking, but as he kept going, I realized he was completely and utterly serious. And the mirth in my eyes turned to horror.\n\nGary barely stopped for a breath. It took me a minute to tune back in to what he was saying after the realization that he was serious hit me.  He starts pulling out all these resources. He was obviously very well prepared for this. I\u2019m not talking about a couple random sources he mentioned in passing here. I\u2019m talking Bible Verses, mathematical equations, diagrams, drawings, websites, YouTube videos, measurements, tools, and more. My hope withered more and more with each new source he presented to me. \n\nHe showed me clips of videos. He drew pictures as he was explaining. He worked out the mathematical equations in front of me and explained every step. He wrote down a dozen URLs for me to look into. He referenced specific Bible verses and emphasized the word choice in them.\n\nIt went on and on and on. At this point, it\u2019s been an hour and a half, and I\u2019ve tried to walk away about a dozen times. I deadass said, \u201cI have to work now,\u201d and went to sit in the office and tried extremely hard to look busy. He just. Kept. Talking. Every time I had to go out to the front desk, he had something to show me. Every time I walked back into the office, he spoke more clearly so I could hear him.\n\nI eventually asked him why people don\u2019t fall off the ends of the Earth. He said that there were great ice walls surrounding the edges of the Earth. I asked why it\u2019s not common knowledge. He says the ice walls are guarded by a branch of the military, and they make people turn around before they can see the walls. He said that this information is kept under wraps because the government doesn\u2019t want to admit that they\u2019re using so many resources to guard these walls. If everyone knew about it, there would be a riot.\n\nI managed a grimace\/smile combination as I politely nodded my head. I thought that maybe he would leave sooner if I looked like I believed him. And honestly, I didn\u2019t particularly want to antagonize a weirdo when I was alone in a hotel. I just tried to go with it. \n\nHe told me that he\u2019s saving up for a sophisticated Nikon camera so he could have photographic evidence of the Earth being flat. This guy was saving up for a $1k camera to prove that the Earth was flat. \n\nEventually, a big group of people came to check out, and he finally walked away. He came back about 10 minutes later and said, \u201cy\u2019know, most young people don\u2019t have an open mind like you do. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re so willing to learn and consider new information. Can I take a picture of you?\u201d And as he raised his phone camera up to snap it, I shouted \u201cNO!\u201d A million mental images of my face appearing on flat Earth websites and social media pages flashed before my eyes, and I was nearly frozen in horror. \n\nHe was disappointed but left nonetheless.\n\n20 minutes later, I have a guest come to the front desk and say, \u201cExcuse me miss, I\u2019m sorry to bother you, but there\u2019s a man outside harassing people. He\u2019s out there shouting about planets and ice walls to anyone who walks by.\u201d\n\nI sighed and looked at him. I lowered my voice and said, \u201csir, he stood here and preached the same things to me for over two hours. If he isn\u2019t following people into their cars or hurting anyone, there\u2019s not a whole lot I can do. I\u2019m not going to invite that man back inside.\u201d Thankfully, the guest understood and assured me that we was just standing out there preaching and not actually hurting or stalking people.\n\nBut damn.

As of late, we've been sold out nearly every day. That's normally fine, but the circumstances of it are pretty sad. Lots of reporters. but, thankfully, most of them have left. Now we're just inundated with the normal crowd. . . and a couple of stragglers, which is good news, because it wasn't fun having reporters turning our lobby into a newsroom. I'm only including this to reflect my mental state as of late. Hearing your town, and your friends' accents being made fun of. . . morbid jokes about a man you personally know. . . it causes a lot of stress, and anger. I've been waking up talking to myself about work. I've been having panic attacks. I guess I'm still incredibly thin-skinned for this industry, despite working in it for 14 years.\n\nAnyway, we sell out all the time, but we try to keep from overbooking, because it's a small town with few hotels, so we can't really walk a guest to a \"comparable\" property. There's another hotel close by, but it isn't the same brand, and it isn't interior access.\n\nThe past couple of days, OTAs have been overbooking us when our inventory is closed. Yesterday, I put like four non-existent rooms on hold. My GM okayed it, and said that she would be sure to talk with the OTAs to make sure it doesn't happen.\n\nOnce again, we were sold out today. We got overbooked right as my GM was leaving, and had to open a DNR room with a leak in the bathroom. That was the last feasibly available room. There are two others. One is a storage room, and the other is being treated for the dreaded bedbugs (ugh...).\n\nSo, all is well, right? I go on break to the store, and pick up some ciggies. . . and my coworker takes off early. I'm confident that everything will go well. The inventory's closed, etc. . . Nope.\n\nJust as he leaves we get a new reservation. I call my GM, and all she can do is to tell me to call the OTA. I tried the number on the reservation, but it didn't work, so I had to call my GM again. I felt like an idiot, because I didn't think to click on the travel agent tab. So, I call them, and go through all the hoops to get a person. The woman on the other end of the phone starts acting like it's our fault, even though the inventory was supposed to have been closed-- like my GM specifically told me that it was, and that she personally did it. She asked me if I could walk them, so I call my GM, and tell her that I need her to talk to them, which becomes a speaker phone conversation that went around in circles, and my GM flat out told them that this was an issue on their end, so she wasn't willing to pay for the guest to be walked. . . all the while. I'm checking in guests with this going on in the background. \n\nThen a supershiny with no reservation comes in, and asks if we have rooms. My GM is on the phone explaining that we are overbooked, but I guess he wasn't paying attention, because he has the nerve to ask, \"Not even for a supershiny member?\" Girl, bye. Sold out means sold out, and we are more than sold out. I gave him a water, and a cookie. Whatever.\n\nOut of nowhere, a regular calls, and says that she needs to cancel. So, I modified the reservation for next week. Immediately, I put a hold on the upgraded room, and called the OTA back to let them know that a room is now available. This resulted in me getting put on hold for about an hour while they attempted to contact the guest. Finally they just asked that I keep the hold, which is fine, because the hotel gets paid either way. They told me that they would call back as soon as they got a hold of her.  I guess they finally did, because right as she was walking in, about an hour and a half after this ordeal, I got a call from them telling me again to keep the room.\n\nSo, she got an upgraded room, and I got to listen to a jaunty tune while on hold. I guess it did make the time go by faster. My panic attack has dissipated. They aren't too bad, my hands just shake, I can't think quite as clearly, and my chest hurts. I've seen worse, but it isn't pleasant. I've just had a few bad experiences with \"walking\" guests, and being yelled at mercilessly. \n\nSo, here's to a hopefully better night!\n\nWell, never mind, guest assistance just called. . . Someone complained that their room smelled of chlorine.

I recently moved to a new state and got a job within the same brand. This wasn't an official transfer I just got lucky to be within the same branding just a different franchised company.\n\nNow this isn't some off brand hotel this is genuine hotel.\n\nI came from a property that our scores were dancing between 85-95% all around each month. The lowest i've ever seen was 78%.\n\nThis new property dances around 30-47% its mind-boggling. I was determined to make a difference and try to bring these scores up as a front desk agent. I can't.\n\nIts been 4 months now at this job and I can't bring the scores up regardless of everything that I do and the biggest reason is that this hotel needs MAJOR repairs and a new paintjob. I feel like i'm in hotel nightmares with that Gorden Ramsey show. We have no maintenance guy, we have no basic items that are needed like non-slip pads, coffee for the rooms, water dispensers or water jug anywhere in the lobby, freakin GUM OR COUGHDROPS IN THE MARKET??? The pool! The pool has been closed this whole time I started working here. I'm in Ohio where apparently everyone and their dog wants to use the pool its bonkers. Mold! mold on the entire first floor so we all are told to avoid using the first floor. Leaking! the roof leaks in some hallways because it rains so much here. Breakfast! Now This is my first property that has a bistro for breakfast, and I understand there are package deals when you book you get \"complimentary breakfast\" but thats just not true. If your rate includes it you get a coupon for 10 dollars off the breakfast, NOT FREE BREAKFAST. Now I don't know the logistics behind it but I feel like there is something shady going on behind the scenes. Meeting rooms! If you so much as REQUEST a 2nd table or another chair or god forbid a jug of water, thats a 150 charge to include while you get setup in there. Like at my old property if they requested to move a table or an extra chair or 2 we just did it. But here one slight adjustment will be a major charge no ands, ifs, or buts.\n\nNow that you know the background; onto the story, my main manager came up to me directly extremely upset that the scores are still low and asking me (not the front desk supervisor btw) why the scores aren't getting any higher. I explained to them and SHOWED them the reviews explaining that people are upset because the pool is never open, showers either don't work or they don't have hot water, the furniture is old and just worn out, or the breakfast is overpriced (which it is) for what you get. There is literally NOTHING, nothing in terms of the front desk or customer service, in fact those are the best qualities you have.\n\nBut he doesn't care and explains that we at the front desk should be very apologetic and that will fix the issue, but I couldn't help but talk back and say, \"No this hotel needs a lot of work and repair, your trying so hard to up the scores but don't want to fix the issues the guests themselves are telling you because it costs money. We at the front desk are doing our best and asking every guest if everything was okay, what to improve on, and to please give us a good review\" (which btw they drill it in our brains to ask that to every guest which just feels like begging up the wazzo now i'm not psychologist but I feel like begging for good reviews will make someone not want to do it) to which he explained that hes working on it but he wants to get the scores up first before comitting to spending the money for the property. WHAT. I even asked why haven't we opened the pool yet and he explains because its chemicals in the water and waiting for the health inspector. Its been over 3 months now! We don't hire a maintenance man because we can't find one but I believe because its that he doesn't want to pay a good wage for one and he does it himself. He practically is prepping to lay off front desk agents to get fresh ones in here because of this, probably me included. (during tax season btw I had literally over 100 W2s to put into envelopes to mail to previous employees here, it wouldn't surprise me if they were all front desk agents who either left or got laid off). At the end of the day he is explaining to me or lecturing me \"You guys at the front desk need to be making these  guests happy that your job\"\n\nI practically got yelled at for the bad scores when all these scores are saying \"because the pool wasnt open.\" or \"I had to move rooms because my shower \/ TV didnt work\" or \"breakfast was supposed to be included but it wasn't I just got a 10 dollar off coupon\" or \"I booked a meeting room but was charged an extra 150 because we asked for one extra table\".\n\nI came here hoping to make a difference at this property because they all seemed like honest people that are struggling or just didn't know what to do, but now I see the main manager just don't want to put in the money or effort to repairing the building itself or hire people to fix the issues on the daily. Hell I bet the health inspector for the pool hasn't shown up because he just doesn't want to pay for it.\n\nI have a job interview soon so I hope to bounce out of here lol. \\*rant over\\*\n\nEdit and update; wowza i didn\u2019t expect this to pop! Hi mom! Lol realistically though i have a 2nd job interview next week and i hope i get the new job so i can leave. Because i don\u2019t want to rock the boat when i still need a job. Ive never contacted corporate before or tried to whistleblow anything as i wouldn\u2019t even know where to start or what to do exactly but i do know once i get my new job and put my 2 week i\u2019ll contact corporate because this is bananas and id hate to at worse subject guests to bad experiences and new employees having to be yelled at or complained about with room issues when they can\u2019t do anything and in hopes corporate can do something about it because ive never seen anything like it.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678282824.0},{"title":"Local fool is surprised that we need the cardholder in the lobby when using her card to pay for the room.","author":"MaidOfClarity","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11ltwa5\/local_fool_is_surprised_that_we_need_the\/","text":"Soooo, it's somewhere past midnight.

I blame the full moon.\n\nI got the Liars, the Complainers, the Unprepared, the Faulty Equipment, the \"I Booked at the Wrong Hotel\"s...\n\n...and I got to end the night with the Drunks! \n\nWe've had a ship crew staying with us since November. Nice guys, they are. They're leaving soon to take their ship elsewhere. The majority of them thought today was going to be their last day in the hotel (apparently the lady in charge of their reservations hasn't been communicating to them that she's extended them 3 times). A chunk of the crew decided to go out and have a few drinks to commemorate. They left around 6pm. \n\nMy shift ended at 11, but I have a terrible habit of staying way after I clock out to talk to NA. That terrible habit has come in handy for her as she sometimes gets guests who come down to flirt with her. She's about 10 years younger than me, and her Mean Gene hasn't kicked in yet, so I act as a buffer for her. \n\nI was especially useful last night when our ship crew came back around midnight *absolutely schmammered!*\n\nNA and I were at the desk when we saw them stumbling through the parking lot. There were 5 who went out. One was stone cold sober, and you could see the annoyance on his face as he walked ahead of everyone. Another guy, drunk af, actually could walk a straight line. That line was just perpendicular to where he needed to go \ud83e\udd74\n\nThen there was a guy who I'll call Lumber Jack--partly because he was dressed like one and partly because it describes how he walked back into the hotel. It's like he was trying to remember how to use all his limbs all at once. \n\nAnywho, all the guys made it back into the hotel without falling or bumping into anything. No one was obnoxious. They just couldn't walk correctly. They all headed straight for their rooms (allegedly). I wished them a safe journey up the elevator and continued my chat with NA.\n\nSix minutes later, we heard a loud beep from our stairwell intercom behind the front desk. Scared the *shit* out of us because no one ever uses it. Thankfully, I remembered how to operate it, so I went over to see who needed our assistance.\n\n\"Hello?\" I said into the speaker. I was met with heavy breathing. This repeated several times before I decided that NA and I should just go up and see who was there. We had a suspicion that it was one of the drunks who just walked in, but we didn't know what state we'd find them in. We were nervous as all hell, but we agreed that we were each braver with each other.\n\nWe walked cautiously up the stairs. The higher we got, the more we could hear labored breathing and dry heaving. To avoid startling whoever this was, I let out a few timid Hellos, and still got no response. The distress call came from the 3rd floor stairwell. NA and I arrived to see no one, but the sick sounds were louder than ever. We soon looked up to see Lumber Jack leaning over the wall of the 4th floor stairs. This is odd, because his room is on the 3rd floor.\n\n\"You okaaaaayyyy...???\" NA asked, her voice giving away her nervousness.\n\n\"Yezzz ma'am,\" Lumber Jack replied, initializing his catchphrase of the night (think Matthew McConaughey's \"Alright alright alright!\"--it sounded just like that lol).\n\nThrough some other unintelligible grunts and drunken gestures, he assured us he was okay and didn't need any assistance. We retreated back to the front desk. Ain't no way in hell we were gonna just take his drunk ass word for it though, so we planned to go back up after a few minutes. \n\nAnd so we did. We went back up the same stairwell, only for me to round the corner and stumble upon him slumped over on the 3rd floor stairs. I held my breath waiting for signs of life. They came quickly with his signature heavy breathing. NA and I took turns trying to wake him up. He flashed his bloodshot eyes at us and gave us a few more \"Yezzz ma'am\"s before agreeing to let us help him to his room just down the hall. \n\nThe image of us two shrimpy little women trying to keep this 7'12\" drunk ass tree of a man from pinballing down the hall was hilarious to watch on camera later when it was all over. I'm just glad it was 2 of us there, because I don't think either one of us could have done that on our own. \n\nBut, we got it done. We got him into his room, then later we put together a hangover package of sorts for him--bottle of water, some Powerade, Tylenol, and a couple packs of coffee. If I could have thrown in a big greasy burger, I would have lol\n\nHe's been in his room all day. There was a note about the whole incident on our communications board. GM commended our quick thinking. FOM and I both did a wellness check on him. When I called him tonight during my shift, he said he has no memory of even coming back to the hotel and could only imagine what an ass he had been.

People with chronic pain, more intense or visible disorders. I don\u2019t wallow or feel sorry for myself over something that\u2019s manageable.\n\nDespite my mild anxiety, ongoing sleepiness, and occasional tremors I\u2019ve had management positions, been in very highly sought after commission roles, and generally have impressed everyone with my professional performance and have a resume I\u2019m proud of.\n\nI remember this guest.

I know what they\u2019re talking about and I know for a fact that I wasn\u2019t pausing between words to communicate articulately with a stutter because I have a *friggin family member* who has been doing that my *whole life* and what the hell were they doing talking about it amongst themselves then putting it in a review??

Because obviously, having people stay with you for free makes much more financial sense than fixing the problems at your property...?!?!\n\nRammington (not the actual name), get your shit together. Assford (also not the actual name), get your shit together. It's ***embarrassing*** to work here. It's a drain on my soul. We fail at being a hotel. And that's ignoring the fact that we have no management, the task force managers that have been sent are useless, our medical kits have NONE of the items that are mandated (to the point that I need a band-aid and we don't have any), we're out of office supplies, the alarm in the back office has been going for months, checklists are grievously out of date, sales is outsourcing 90% of its job to the front desk, charge routing isn't being done properly, we don't have the supplies to make HHorrors bags properly, the pantry is horribly under-supplied,  I don't have the supplies to organize the audit properly...the list goes on, and on, and on, and on. I could take $100 and solve eight or nine of this place's problems in the space of an hour, but I'm not confident I'd get reimbursed.\n\nI suspect we're finally going to get our renovation - meaning, make the place look pretty - somewhere around the middle of the year, and they're going to immediately turn around and sell it to some poor soul without telling them about the massive, fundamental problems with the place. Add in the fact that I've applied for the now-vacant management positions and no one has even talked to me, and hope has left the building.\n\nOh, and just in case this isn't enough of a tale...just tonight this guy came in with a group and wanted to get something from our pantry. The group organizer made sure that notes were on each account stating that they covered room and tax only, and each person was responsible for their own incidentals. Well, this guy first complained that the group *always* covers incidentals (well, not this time buddy) and then wanted to put his card on the room for incidentals. Cool, we did that, and he complained that we charged him $80. (We authorized $80 on his card. 4 x $20 = $80.) When I explained to him that it was an authorization and not a charge, he demanded that I remove the authorization...which I don't have the permissions to do. I guess he thought he could just put a card down for incidentals and it wouldn't authorize anything???\n\nRant over.

I say no, as long as we receive payment before check out he wouldn't have to. Otherwise he would have to check out and check back in and would have to give another deposit. He said okay and left. A few hours later he was back and said he wanted to extend the room. I said no problem and asked for the room number, which he gave. The room had a woman's name on it, so just in case he had given me the wrong number, I asked him to confirm the name. He gave me a blank stare, then stepped to the side and started fumbling with his phone and mumbling something about not knowing her name.\n\nMy spidey senses tingled. Pretty weird to not know the name of the person who booked the room you're staying in. It's not even like he knew the first name and not the last name. After I checked in another guest, he came back up with the correct name. I informed him that since the room wasn't in his name, I could not extend the reservation. I'd need the person who rented the room there to confirm that it was okay. He didn't like that answer for obvious reasons but didn't fight me on it.\n\nThis morning, a young woman comes up to the desk and asks about extending that room. I'd seen her around with the guy because they'd been in house for a couple days. I kind of suspected she wasn't the person who booked the room, because she'd been around with the guy. Seems weird not to know her name at all. Unless it's like a Seinfeld episode. (Also Dolores only rhymes with clitoris if you're pronouncing it wrong. That fictional character knew some weird ass people if they went there with that name. Also I don't watch Seinfeld and I don't remember why I know about that scene. So if for some reason you want to talk about Seinfeld in the comments, I only know that scene and the one where Jerry has a reservation for a car, but they don't have any cars. That one I know for the obvious reasons. Anyway this parenthetical has probably gone on long enough).\n\nBack to the story, I ask the young lady for her ID. Deer in headlights. She says she lost it. I tell her I will need it to extend the reservation. She says she's going to go get it. Which seems like a weird thing to say if you've lost your ID. 45 minutes or something later, it's 2 minutes to checkout and she's back... to turn in the keys. Guess she didn't find the ID.\n\nThis all happened six hours ago, and by weird coincidence while I was writing this, the dude came back in and asked if they had to pay a deposit if they booked online.

I personally handled Steven\u2019s check-in. Nothing out of the ordinary, but I thought he was a bit forceful and intimidating when he spoke to me. As I was checking him in, he asked about a late checkout around 1pm. I told him that we could accommodate that, but per our policy, he\u2019d have to pay for half a day. He\u2019d booked a prepaid nonrefundable reservation through a third party, and as such, I\u2019d have to make a new reservation just to charge for his late checkout. Third parties suck. \n\nI explained why a new reservation would be necessary if he wanted a 1pm checkout. I can\u2019t charge half of the OTA\u2019s rate- it has to be the hotel\u2019s rate. He was super understanding and polite about it and thanked me for my help. \n\nI noted the 1pm checkout in three different places. I wrote it in my recap email (which goes to both my managers and the next front desk agent coming in, so we can all stay updated on what\u2019s going on), in the notes within his reservation, and in housekeeping\u2019s notes so they\u2019d know he\u2019d be there until 1. \n\nHe asked me for a corkscrew that night. Not a strange request at all. I actually bought a corkscrew for the hotel because they only had a bottle opener, so I gave it to him to use. He never returned it.\n\nWell, the next afternoon he storms into the lobby after getting a courtesy call from the front desk around 1:30pm regarding his late checkout and how payment would be for a full night if he didn\u2019t check out by 2pm. \n\nSteven reeks of alcohol and starts yelling at the FDA. He said *I* told him that he could stay until 8pm for a half day\u2019s price. My coworker immediately said, \u201cuh, no, I\u2019m certain she didn\u2019t say that.\u201d He tried insisting before saying that the guy who did night audit also told him he could stay until 8pm. And then he said that the manager told him it was okay over the phone.\n\nMy coworker held steady and didn\u2019t humor his lies. And when someone won\u2019t believe your lies, what\u2019s left for a grownass man to do but start screaming and making threats? So that\u2019s exactly what Steven did. He insulted my coworker, sat down at the high top table in the lobby and just stared at her maliciously, and then got back up to scream some more. He demanded to see the manager, so my coworker called her (it was the manager\u2019s day off) and she said she\u2019d be at the hotel as soon as possible. \n\nMeanwhile Steven is foaming at the mouth and calling the FDA a \u201cfucking bitch\u201d and saying that he\u2019d \u201cfind her and she\u2019d get what\u2019s coming to her.\u201d More screaming. More insults. More threats. She did ask him to leave, but he refused. And then she told him to leave, and he still refused and then told her that he\u2019d figure out where she lived and what her full name was so he could \u2018get back at her.\u2019 And then he said, \u201cif you try to throw me out of here, I\u2019ll call the cops.\u201d\n\nMy coworker said, \u201clmfao good idea, let\u2019s call the cops.\u201d And she did. My manager arrived and told this guy he needed to get his shit and get out. Of course he refused and wanted a full refund. Nope. Police got there, and he slipped out the side door to try and get in his car. The police stopped him and told him he couldn\u2019t drive while he was so drunk. They told him his wife needed to drive and Steven would just have to come back and get his car when he was sober. They told him he\u2019d be arrested if he came back inside to start his shit again.\n\nSo Steven left. And you may think that\u2019s the end of it, but apparently while he was pouting while we were waiting for the police to get there, he made *another* prepaid nonrefundable reservation through a third party. Most likely as an attempt to prevent us from throwing him out. \n\nWell, later that night I got a call from a third party customer service representative saying that she, \u201chad a client on the phone who says he was forced to leave the hotel for no reason and was denied a refund.\u201d She asked if I could explain, and I did. I told her that he\u2019d been removed by the police after drunkenly threatening the staff. This bitch really asks me why he felt the need to threaten us. As if there\u2019s any valid reason to threaten an FDA. I told her. And she says, \u201cwell can you at least cancel and refund his reservation for tonight?\u201d Uh, no, I\u2019m not authorized to cancel any prepaid nonrefundable reservations. What part of \u2018nonrefundable\u2019 did she not understand?? So she said, \u201cso you\u2019re refusing to give my client a refund?\u201d No ma\u2019am, I\u2019m saying I can\u2019t cancel third party reservations. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my client that you\u2019re refusing a refund then. Can I have your name for the record?\u201d\n\nImagine the sheer audacity it takes to, after making threats and being evicted by the police, go crying to the OTA and asking for a refund because he was unfairly denied a room.\n\nNo, Steven, you can\u2019t stay until 8pm without paying for it. Seems a logical conclusion to make, but with people like Steven, logic doesn\u2019t enter into the equation.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678109982.0},{"title":"This is going to be a fun weekend\u2026","author":"Vilaya","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11k67rh\/this_is_going_to_be_a_fun_weekend\/","text":"Gonna vent.\n\nI hate that Sales lets these groups keep coming back. The entire FD hates that Sales lets them keep coming back. The housekeepers hate that these groups are allowed back. The kitchen was given a heads up that the groups are coming back. The groups? A few teen athletic groups and we\u2019re currently at three people who walked out in the middle of a shift and threatened to quit over how these teams treated them.\n\nNear us is a sports area that hosts a competition that involves several middle and high school teams. So we have like three or four blocks of little athletes and their parents every six months. Let me tell you, they are hell incarnate. They were so bad their first visit that our former GM told the coaches that every guest who stayed with us would be banned from the property if they treated the staff the same way during their next visit. Things got a bit better after that, but this time we have a green Guest Service Manager.\n\nShe sent an email to the FD that she allowed a few promised late check outs already for a very small fee. Big mistake. All the parents know each other, and you probably know where that goes. She didn\u2019t cc the GM who is familiar with these groups and that escaped my attention. I mentioned it to him in passing when he was touching base with the FD this morning. I wasn\u2019t aware that he didn\u2019t know about this muck up and I swear I actually saw him develop a headache when I rehashed the news to him.\n\nYou see, the last event for the groups is a few hours after check in, so literally everyone wants an complimentary late checkout which is two hours before check in and can only be promised to a few people a day. Housekeeping just can\u2019t do that. Because of the sheer amount of requested late check outs, we\u2019ve become creative since the groups started coming, but haven\u2019t found the right method yet. GM told me this morning to start keeping a list of the names and phone numbers of the people who have been calling requesting a late checkout so we can do first-come-first-served with whatever we end up doing. I put in the pass along that the list now exists and to keep it updated per GM. He said he\u2019s going to figure something out and he has to BECAUSE\u2026 the first stay the hotel ran into the problem of people not leaving their rooms until after that last event to shower and pack.

I met them initially once briefly because I accidentally left with the office keys after audit and had to come back to return them. There were several guests at the lobby when I walked in and our normal FDA was off taking care of something leaving the new owners at the desk and they didn't seem to know what they were doing--becuase they don't. They didn't even know who I was despite my introduction and had to explain to them several times I was returning the office keys. \"Who are you?\" uh ... your NA?\n\nThere is a much larger backstory but I'll try to be brief. The wife's family owns a large number of hotels in not only my state but several neighboring states as well. They own franchises for a number of brands. Anyway they \"sold\" our property to the wife (is very dubious but what can I do) who has only owned grocery stores and never a hotel. From what I can tell so far they are good business people, they just never worked in hotels. \n\nEveryone was taken aback initially becuase we received no warning and they didn't bother telling our GM until a week or so before the \"sale\". My GM, who is wonderful btw, is basically being phased out after the new owners are fully trained. She'll be OK though I'm not privvy to their negotiations but they're letting her go with a sizeable package ... probably knows where the bodies are buried etc. Us normal employees though who knows.\n\nSo currently the owners are on property and make it a point to waltz into the office unannounced at odd hours to make sure I'm still here I guess. They'll throw out new terms they learned that day like \"RevPar\" just to make sure I'm on my toes checking in non-existent people. They told me not to turn down anyway because they have bills to pay. I asked about the DNR list and they said \"whats that?\" Oh boy ... I explained it and they said only turn down drug users and room damage. Noise complaints etc. are OK now. \n\nOK so thats that. Tonight (audit) I had a lady come in who booked through Hellpedia for the FOLLOWING day of course. This happens so many times when they give me their name and its not there \\*internal sigh\\* \"let me check tomorrows reservations one moment please.\" Its the usual I beging to explan what happened and since its third party Hellpedia SUCC they need to contact them directly etc. She looked at me and said \"Are you kidding me, I just made the reservation I HAVE A CONFIRMATION #!\" I said yes, and it is made for the next business day yada yada. \n\nShe pulls out an Ipad and points at the date and says \"What. Day. Is. It.\" I open our POS and say the date and she says \"Yes, I booked for today I need to be checked in now.\" I politely inform her our check-in time for \"TtOoDdAaYy!\" is 3pm as spelled out on the website. That got under her skin because you know, its true. Around that time a mother walked in with 3 young kids.\n\nShe kept demanding I check her in \"immediatetly\" and I tired several times to explain that I could not as in the system itself won't let that happen she needs to contact Hellpedia directly and go from there. I wasn't even saying I wouldn't approve of the date change because I would but she would have to contact them HERSELF. Eventually I said I could check her in \"immediately\" but it would be our in house rates not Hellpedias. \n\nAt this point the mother behind her was getting visibly annoyed as she waited to check in. She let out a sigh and the Karen turned around said said \"Shut your ass.\" The mother looked slightly bemused I made eye contact with here and shook my head, she got my message I would deal with this she didn't need to get involved. I said, politely, \"Ma'am we do not tolerate that behavior here. I will not be renting to you so you can leave \"immediately\". I have already explained to you how to change dates on this reservation which is the same way to get a refund. You need to contact them directly. Have a nice day.\" \n\nShe looked like she was about to blow a gasket and pulled the usual \"give me your managers #!\" \"you  can't do that!\" I just told her to leave and ignored her until she did. I apologized profusely to the mom and she understood and was very nice. I called my FOM who is relieving me this morning and told her I'm DNRing that lady and could she please explain that to the new owners.\n\nIts my 8th day in a row working because we're short and had a no\/call no show FDA. I pulled a double today 3pm-7am and we're well into the new pay period so I will get at least a 3 day weekend, I'll ask for 4 and make a mini vacation out of it. I'm not sure if I'll have this job for much longer the new owners are taking applications for \"all positions.\" Honestly though, if they don't even know what a DNR list is and its value maybe its for the better.

Let's find out!'\n\nSo we go into the back office and we see that the top flap of the backpack is already unzipped so we decide to look inside. I reach down and grab the flap to open it...\n\nMe: 'Yeah housekeeping was kinda freaked out because they said the found some dirty things in his room and didn't want to JESUS CHRIST! FUCK! FUUUUUCK!'\n\nAnd there, on the very top of the backpack, it was staring at us. *The biggest goddamn fleshlight in human existence.*\n\nI immediately jerk my hand away as my Auditor is literally doubled over with laughter. I ran back to the front desk and the sanitary station and doused my hands in Ecolab Sanitizing Foam^TM.

I'm off to take a long, hot shower.\n\n\nEDIT: To clarify...the guest abandoned his property. Yes we wondered about it and went to check it before putting it in our offices.

We tipped even the Front Desk staff, and were nothing but appreciative. We asked for an upgrade in the room not because there was anything fundamentally wrong with the room, but just because we did not have an ocean view. Very nicely said \u201cif it is not possible, not a big deal because the place and the staff are lovely\u201d. \n\nWell turns out the staff talk to each other, the front desk staff said \u201ccheckout at noon, hang out until 3 and we will rearrange rooms\u201d. That waiting was not a big deal, we had a great time sitting on lawn chairs soaking up the sun. The wait actually turned out to be until 5 and each time the staff came by to say \u201cdelay, please wait a bit longer\u201d. Each time we were \u201cnot a problem and thank you for the help\u201d \u2026 there was a gentleman from Germany near us bitching about his room sitting waiting near us and the front desk staff\u2019s answer to his angry was to give him a couple keys and let him pick his room from one \u201con par with the price point he paid\u201d \u2026 honestly he was a jerk because what do you expect when you go inexpensive ? \n\nwell got the upgrade at 5 and we are blown away !!!

To be honest, we had enough people to handle work at the front desk but she wanted a job and the owners didn\u2019t mind giving her a chance to work the front again. The only problem had been her attitude and I assumed that she might have matured a bit and learned how to curb her negative attitude since then (despite the fact she was already a grown woman at the time of my previous experiences with her).\n\nThis girl was assigned the evening shift as she lived a bit away and requested It, the owners \u2014 doing as they do \u2014 agreed readily.\n\nEvery single goddamn day I worked \u2014 and somewhat sparingly on the days I didn\u2019t \u2014 she would not come in on time.\n\nSo what? It\u2019s not like five or six minutes are that big a deal? Right?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t mind if you are five minutes late or so, I can deal with it.\n\nBut try her coming in to every evening shift at 7pm. 4 hours after she was supposed every single day I worked and on days I didn\u2019t work she would come in a little earlier but not by much.\n\nDo you know why?\n\nBecause I do my best and my bosses liked me and I was capable of 12 hours shifts \u2014 despite how tiring they were \u2014 because if they needed me to I was usually willing to give up my off days for overtime\n\nBecause she was sure that she could do that with no repercussions as she was the daughter of the owners and were all supposed to work under her and listen to every demand she because she might as well be the owner of the hotel.\n\nShe took advantage of that.\n\nEvery single time she would saunter in with a coffee in hand and make up some BS story about her driveway being blocked or her cat having a medical emergency or some other crap. And this was always a text to me \u2014 not the owners \u2014 at around 5pm.\n\nAfter a month of this, I had enough of her shit.\n\nSince I had those texts, I screen-shotted all of them and sent them to my boss who passed it to the owners who were subsequently appalled at her conduct. They were the type of people who didn\u2019t tolerate their employees \u2014 especially me \u2014 being taken advantage of by anyone, no matter who they were. Within the week she was not on the schedule and they restructured it back to the way it was originally. I was happy but then I got texts from her accusing me of being a fat diabetic and virginal little boy who is delusional who will never amount to anything. I sent those \u2014 after blocking her \u2014 to the bosses and they were furious with her for verbally abusing me and I never heard from her again.\n\nLesson to be learned?\n\nDon\u2019t fuck with me.\n\nI bite back, bitch.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678081650.0},{"title":"My (long) horror story for the week","author":"dixonticonderogahb","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11j7ywx\/my_long_horror_story_for_the_week\/","text":"It's 2:30am on a busy Saturday morning (Friday nights are usually busy, but tonight our hotel had received all the passengers from a diverted flight, so I'd just spent the last hour-and-a-half checking-in 60+ unhappy people and was now drowning in airline vouchers and paperwork).  I step away from the Front Desk to use the copier, and when I return a minute later, there's a man slouched against it with a can of beer on the counter.  We have a beer fridge up here, but I can't sell any after midnight, so my first words to this gentleman are to apologetically inform him that, unfortunately, I can't sell alcohol this late.  This is always awkward, but guests trying to wrench the door to the fridge open after hours has ruined the lock, so I get lots of practice.  He tells me that the beer is his, and he just wants a new key-card for his room.  Okay, of course; I apologize for misunderstanding.  I can certainly get him a new key.  I request his ID, explaining the policy about needing to check when I hand out keys, and he gives me his license without complaint... and then, suddenly, he's angry.  Not just a little angry, but startlingly angry; livid.  He doesn't appreciate being treated this way.  How dare I talk to him like this!  If I'm going to talk to him like that, he's going to give it right back - I'm a fucking racist, I'm a fucking piece of shit, he's going to get me fired, ruin my life, I'm FUCKED.\n\nI just stand there, blinking.  He didn't seem to mind my asking for his ID; was it the thing about the beer?  Is this a joke?  No, not a joke - he's screaming now.  He's apoplectic.  I try to apologize: \"Sir, I'm so sorry I've offended you.  It was not my inten-\"  He's not hearing me.  \"NO!  NO!  NO!\" he screams over me.  I know exactly what I did and now I'm fucked, I'm going to regret this, he's going to make sure of it.  I've handed him his new key by now, and he starts toward the elevator, yelling over his shoulder at me the whole way.  I'm a fucking bitch, but he's going to show me.  I'm going to get what's coming to me.  The elevator doors close on him as he screams about how much of a bitch I am.  By the way, I'm male, so please do not impute any misogynistic attitudes to our guest based on any of this.\n\nI'm stunned, and my heart is too rapidly distributing adrenaline, but the puzzle is starting to come together: this guy must be on something.  Either that or he's dealing with untreated mental illness, but he had the distinctive wiry, dentally-deficient look of a meth-enjoyer, so I'm betting drugs.  I'll just put a note about this encounter in the day's log so that-\n\nThe elevator doors open.  It's him again, and he's already screaming at me from across the lobby.  He's calling the cops.  He's pressing charges.  He's on the phone with the police right now and I'm fucked.  I'm going to be arrested.  \n\nOkay, so definitely drugs... but now it's beginning to dawn on me that I don't actually know what this tweaker is capable of.  He's not letting this go.  There are almost 300 rooms in this hotel, but tonight I'm the only employee here, and me and this dude have the first floor all to ourselves.  Usually, the hotel has a security guard on duty at night, but not tonight.  It's just me.\n\nOur guest is now striding with great purpose toward the front doors, hurling invectives at me the whole way.  Is he going outside to wait for the police?  I can only hope.  I watch him go; I couldn't get a word in if I tried.  He appears to leave, and I continue typing my now somewhat expanded log entry.  A minute later, he's back, headed toward the elevator, still yelling at the top of his lungs.  Now he's telling me that he's called his lawyer: he's on a plane at this very moment, coming to ruin my life.  I'm so fucked.  I'm a bitch.  I'm a fucking bitch.  The elevator doors close.  \n\nThree minutes later, the elevator descends and he's back, again stalking determinedly to the front doors, screaming at me as he traverses our voluminous lobby.  He's starting to make me nervous.  I don't think he actually ever called the police, and I'm beginning to entertain doubts as to whether this man even HAS an attorney on retainer... so just what is it that is repeatedly drawing his attention outside?  Why does he keep making the same circuitous trip?  It almost seems like he's working himself up to something.  Does he have a vehicle out in the parking lot?  Does he have a weapon in it?  \n\nThis continues for another two or three passes from the elevator to the parking lot and back as my level of concern increases.  With every loud ingress, I'm anticipating with growing alarm what implement of violence he might have collected during his absence.  I know I need to act, but I don't know how to approach the situation.  He hasn't technically done anything more than yell at me... and he is a paying customer.  I try again to apologize for whatever has agitated him, but again, he drowns out my words with denials and vulgarities.  A few minutes later, he storms up to the desk and throws a handful of key-packets at me, containing perhaps eight keys between them.  He's clearly requested new keys a few times since checking in this afternoon.  He screams that I have locked him out of his room.  He paid a hundred and fifty dollars for that room and he wants back in.  I snuck up and locked him out because I'm a fucking bitch and I'd better give him new keys right now.  I numbly go through the motions of coding new keys, trying to explain that I didn't lock him out, but he proves less than receptive to my words.  Some part of my shell-shocked brain is wondering how all of these keys could have malfunctioned at the same time.  Is he even trying the right door?  No, of course he's not, because he's whacked out of his gourd.  He rips the new key packet out of my hand and takes off back up the elevator, loudly issuing proclamations about my character and impending fate.\n\nI'm trying and failing to bring my focus back to paperwork when the elevator again discharges him, now yelling something about how he's got people coming, and when they get here, I'm fucked.  Okay.  Okay, that's enough.  I've never evicted a guest from the hotel before; I don't even know if I'm allowed to do that, but this deranged meth-head is now explicitly threatening me with something other than dubious legal action, and, if my own safety wasn't enough of a concern, I'm also responsible for that of the property and all the other guests here.  So I tell him that, if he doesn't stop harassing me and return to his room, I'm going to call the police and trespass him from the property.  He loudly informs me that, in fact, I will be the one leaving the property, and he then reprises the classics for good measure.  I reply that I'm calling the police, and then I do.  He takes out his phone and starts filming me as he walks rapidly out to the parking lot, but I notice that he's no longer yelling.\n\nA lady answers and I stammer something mostly intelligible about how there's a guy at the hotel who is threatening me, I think he's high on something, I suspect violence is imminent, and I would really appreciate it if a patrol unit could swing by whenever it's convenient and assist me in making him leave.  She assures me that a unit is on its way.  I leave a voicemail for my GM explaining what I'm doing and why, and he texts me back immediately, telling me that, while he's out of state at the moment, he has my back and guests are definitely not allowed to threaten me, so I'm good to kick this guy out.  Our guest makes a couple more circuits of the lobby, but now he's ostentatiously filming me with his phone and muttering about how he's got people on the way and I'm going to find some things out when they get here.  I silently assure him that we have this in common.\n\nTwo police officers arrive fifteen minutes later, and I'm very glad to see them.  Our guest has now retired to his room, probably in anticipation of their arrival, so the cops ask me to clarify that I am formally trespassing the individual in question from the property.  I confirm this and further express that I've never had to do this before, but I'm ready to cooperate in whatever capacity needed.  Is he a long-term tenant, because tenant law would then be in effect?  No, officer; he checked in yesterday afternoon and is due out today.  The officers begin to put on gloves and then the phone at the Front Desk rings; it's our guest's room.  I pick it up and our guest informs me that his friends are coming, and when they get here, I'm fucked, and also I'm a bitch.  I convey the gist of this to the two officers.  They tell me that they're going to go up to our guest's room, and they'd prefer if I remain in the lobby.  Of course, officers, whatever you say, and thanks again for your help.  They depart up the elevator.\n\nA scant few minutes later, the two officers debark from the elevator and approach me.  Our guest is conspicuously not with them.  They tell me that our guest has declined to open his door.  They knocked, but he didn't answer.  Is he definitely in the room?  Yes, he just called the Front Desk phone from that room as you were standing here.  Can we call the room and speak with him?  Certainly; let me dial the room now.  I do so and hand the phone to the officer: he reports that nobody is picking up.  I tell the officers that I have the master keys with me right now, and I'm more than happy to assist in getting the door open.  The two officers exchange a look.\n\nThe lead officer informs me that our guest has a reasonable expectation of privacy as long as he's in his room, and the police department will under no circumstances violate this.  I'm confused.  I tell him that I've confirmed with the general manager of the hotel that this guest is no longer our guest, ergo it's no longer his room, but rather, it's the hotel's room, and the hotel is private property upon which this drug-induced psychotic is currently trespassing.  I remind him that this man has repeatedly threatened me and that I am at this very moment expecting the arrival of a group of his associates, at which time I've been assured I will be fucked, which, while nonspecific, is surely a term implicative of danger to my person.  I ask him what he's suggesting that I do about all of this.  The lead officer tells me that I can follow whatever hotel policy I want, but that he is under a supervisory directive not to act or appear to act in any way as an agent of a private business, so they will not be assisting me in evicting anyone.  He will in fact not even go so far as to accompany me up to the room, as that would constitute appearing to act as an agent of the hotel.  He gives me his business card and assures me that they will intervene if our guest assaults me, and suggests that I should call the police if I see him again.  I ask him what the point of that would be; he says something polite.  Then they leave.\n\nSo, as it turns out, our guest was correct and I am, in fact, a bitch.  There was nothing I could do other than try to get back to work and hope that he would leave me alone and that his friends wouldn't roll up and beat me to death in the lobby as inoffensive covers of 90s pop hits play on the sound system.  I guess I could have walked off the job, and maybe I should have.  I spent the rest of the night too jittery with adrenaline to concentrate and tensing up every time the elevator opened or the automatic doors stirred.  His friends never did show up (neither did his lawyer), and he never came back down to the lobby.  I guess he'd decided to turn in and have a restful rest of his night, secure in the knowledge that I was a bitch who could do nothing to stop him from doing whatever the fuck he wanted.  Then I went home and tried to relax, only to realize that I couldn't stop shaking, and I was way too wired to sleep.  \n\nI don't know what the lesson of this story is, other than that the police here are less than impressive, that being a night auditor might actually be kind of dangerous, and that I don't get paid enough for this.  Thanks for reading; hope it wasn't too long.\n\nedit: thank you all for the kind words and advice and for letting me vent.

When the aux console worked everything was fine, you would hear it throughout the entire lobby and had plenty of time to deactivate the sirens before they even activated.\n\nUnfortunately for everyone, the auxiliary console is no more meaning that now you have to be sitting right at the desk to even have a chance to hear it. Want to go to the toilet? Want to do one of the many tasks a Night shift has to do? Too bad!

A *local* lady (\u201clocal\u201d as in she has a residence in the same city as the hotel\u2014you get it) checked in with us for a couple nights. I was not the one to check her in.

She retreated to her room with no comment. \n\nThird time: She came back down the next morning, **still in just a towel.** She wanted to talk to a manager about a replacement of her detergent and dryer sheets because she said her clothes came out smelling like pee. I told her the manager was unavailable (because *what manager are you about to talk to in just a towel?!?!*) but I would see what I could do. \n\nShe went back to her room to be naked in private, which I was grateful for. I went and checked the laundry room. She\u2019s the only one to ever make this complaint, plus the dryers were brand new at this point. I went to check anyway. There were no foul odors to speak of. I called her back and said she could grab a complimentary box of detergent and dryer sheets. She said okay. \n\nFourth time: this was about an hour after our last conversation, where I had already agreed to give her free stuff that she never picked up. She called the front desk and demanded to speak to a manager again. My manager had just stepped away from the desk, so I asked if there was anything I could help her with. She said no, she just wanted the manager to call her. Then she hung up. \n\nI told my GM all about this lady when he returned 5 minutes later.

From what I\u2019m told, she finally came to retrieve her complimentary items, with no change in apparel (*ma\u2019am, why did you walk out of your local house in just one outfit???*). She then went into the laundry room, sat on a washing machine in her towel, and was not-so-quietly chanting to herself. \n\nOut of curiosity, my GM went to see the state of her room after she left.

Over half of our staff is brand new, and have been thrown onto desk with little to no training. One major rule of this job is we DO NOT touch 3rd party advanced purchases under ANY circumstances, well a new hire DID touch an ADV purchase and changed the dates for them.

I informed him that since it was our mistake he could contact my general manager and go through the process of a refund, however i would have to make a new reservation for him tonight and grab a new payment method. I have to commend the guy, seems like he finally found his own voice and he started screaming at me along with his wife via speaker phone. \n\n\n\nI was proud of him for finally speaking up for himself, but he was horrid. He stood in my lobby, while a crowd of men formed around him. He called me useless, while he recorded me (a 20 year old girl) sob. I have never been yelled at to this extent before in my life, let alone while being recorded in front of a crowd. I had called my GM 3 times, because that was the only thing that would calm him down in that moment. She never answered.

I\u2019ve told them on multiple occasions that the pool closes at 10pm and they can\u2019t be in after hours. They comply and get out when i ask but they\u2019ll spend the next few hours just hanging out in my parking lot, and then they\u2019re right back the next day!! This has been going on for weeks now.

Here's the gist of what the caller stated...\n\n\"Hey, so I'm trying to see if I'm allowed to rent to your hotel. I tried making a reservation from (insert corporate hotel chain here) website, but it won't let me. I think I've been flagged, and I just wanted to see if I could stay at your hotel because I paid good money to stay before. I didn't know I was suppose to lodge a complaint with the hotel first before going to corporate...etc.\"\n\nSo, yeah, this guy just kept digging a hole for himself. Of course I very politely confirmed that our hotel would no longer honor any of his reservations, and the call ended shortly.\n\nBasically, instead of lodging his complaints to FD, he went straight to corporate to get free nights\/refunds\/points...etc. The hotel staff should already be aware of hotel issues, but if there's something specific, please let the front desk know as soon as you can. Chances are it's an issue that we can resolve right away. Also, we don't want the same issue to happen to a future guest. So, you're doing us a favor by letting us know of any issues with the hotel.\n\nAlso, this guy has been (by his own words) flagged by corporate. Which leads me to believe that our hotel was not the only hotel he has complained about. But that means he's not allowed to book with any of our hotels in our chain. The corporate website has prevented him from booking reservation. Which, in this scenario, is in fact an issue to take with corporate....lol.

I told her I couldn't rent a dirty room, so she called me a racist and said I just didn't want to rent to her. That's the only thing I don't like about working here, as I'm white and my hotel is in a predominately black part of the city.

The lady started screaming at me because she was unaware that this exist. I told her I can reschedule her but I have to discuss with my manager about the fee because she MIGHT get charged. She just keeps yelling and this is the first time I'm getting yelled at because this is my first real job after graduating college. But surprisingly I wasn't upset at the customer, I just felt tired and want to get this over with. She wants to speak with someone in charge, so I put her on hold, and went to ask my manager for help. \n\nMy manager was in another room with the boss. My boss comes into the office a lot because it's a small business so she does work too. Since my boss was there I asked if she could talk to the customer because she is in charge, but she refused, and told me to solve the problem myself. The manager didn't say anything. \n\nI went back to the phone and said unfortunately they're unavailable. I will try to figure this out and call you back. The customer calmed down a bit and she hopes to solve this issue too. After a few minutes, my manager and boss asked me what happened. I told them and they looked annoyed. They told me you're supposed to solve the problem with the customer not call them back. So my manager decided to call them back and decided to waive the fee because the customer is actually new and no one told her about the policy. \n\nBut then she told the customer the first person on the phone is a new employee and she doesn't know what's she's talking about. That comment really hurts me. I tried calming the customer down. And I felt so useless when my boss and manager won't help me. Well, now I learned I can waive the fee if it's a new customer. I didn't know I could do that. I actually did thought about just rescheduling the customer and telling my manager not to charge her because she didn't know. But I was afraid that my manager would yell at me because I didn't follow the policy. \n\nIn the end I got lectured by both boss and manager. Telling me I made such a small situation into a big deal. They told me to just reschedule the customer. But I asked what about the policy? They said it depends on the customer. We only charge them a fee when they're a rude customer. If they're nice, you don't have to charge them. In this case, this customer is new so don't charge her. I find this a bit weird that they're picking favorite customers rather than the customers not following the policy. I guess that's why they said customers might get charged because they decide if they like this person or not. \n\nThe customer decided not to reschedule and came in the next day. I work the next day and I saw her. I'm unsure if she recognized my voice because she was calm. I checked her in and when she went into a room I can hear bits and pieces of her ranting about yesterday to my coworker whose hearing about this for the first time. \n\nIt really hits me when I got home because I started uncontrollably crying to the point I couldn't breath. I started calling myself useless and that's why no one likes you. A lot of negative thoughts. I'm considering leaving this job since I feel like I have no support when I run into an issue. I'm always getting blamed. \n\nI'm unsure if I'm in the wrong. I just wanted to make sure about the policy because the company is quite strict about it. There's post it notes that says you have to remind customers about our policy.

It is a story of delirious highs and despairing lows, of anger, frustration, and hilarity, of questionable choices and righteous struggle. And though the tale is tragic in the end, its telling is a lesson, and perhaps will not leave listeners too sorrowful. For even as we all must pass beyond the mortal veil, each life may contain its moments of joy and contentment. So here, too, though this Tale ends sadly, there are surely brief moments of triumph. This is no [legendary tale of depravity](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/yr9etd\/the_storage_room_of_a_catholic_high_school\/)--truly, one of the greatest Tales ever put to electrons--but it is likely to be my own most epic contribution to this humble subreddit's archive. Enjoy.\n\nIt began late last August, when a first time guest--we'll call him Barry--made a reservation with a couple of my co-workers on the PM shift. The circumstances are obscured now, but Barry claimed that a local airline would be footing the bill for his room (distressed passenger or contractor was his story). Passengers from this airline have been known to be an issue on occasion, but I actually do not recall any disruption from Barry's room over the course of the night. Things were relatively quiet...\n\nUntil the morning. My relief was just warming up, having strolled in pleasantly early and we were having a conversation about the usual pass-down topics when a few guests passing by the Front Desk mentioned there was water coming from the ceiling on second floor. We pulled up the cameras.\n\nThere was a huge, dark puddle of water stretching down half of the western section of the third floor hallway: a good twenty feet or so, meaning it could have come from any of five rooms. (At least it wasn't a leak UNDER the floor. Probably.) My relief called our General Manager, and went up to the floor in question with our shuttle driver (whose background is useful at times such as this). After listening at the doors of several of the nearby rooms, they heard water running in the room at the end of the hall: it was, as you may have foreseen, the room registered to Barry. Loudly did they pound on the door, but hearing no answer, they used a staff key to enter.\n\nGreeting my co-workers was a fearsome tableau. Water puddled deep past the door, carpet squelching underfoot. And to the left, across a vast stretch of impromptu swamp, lay a glimpse of the source of this spreading flood: an overflowing bath tub, occupied by a loudly snoring, pale, drunken, flabby Barry. Our fearless shuttle driver stormed in to asses what had caused this state of affairs.\n\nWith a quick slap, he shut off the flow of water from the tub's faucet and forcibly shook Barry's clammy shoulder, speaking the ancient revival incantation: **\"WAKE UP, YOU IGNORANT SONUVABITCH!\"**\n\nMeanwhile, our staff on site had already started scrambling to clean up the massive leak (and I had gone home). I am unashamed to say I was a little gleeful that I did not have to deal with the forthcoming poo-storm. I missed quite the show, however, as I later learned.\n\nReading the beginning of this tale, and seeing how it progressed, some of you may have predicted that the airline to which Barry billed his room, would not cover the damage he caused. And indeed, they did not. He had no authorization whatsoever to bill them for his room. And now (he complained, standing outside his room on third floor, amidst all the damage he had caused), all of his things were wet. All of *his* things were wet? Talk about the Lion, the Witch, and the Audacity of this bitch.\n\nMy General Manager, absolute legend that she is, took one of the soaked carpet tiles **and flung it at him like a frisbee**. (She asked that I not include this part. I told her, I have to: *it's the BEST part.*)\n\nWell, as it turned out, Barry was on our shuttle schedule for a ride to the airport. Guess who *did not* get a ride to the airport. He did *get* there, we are just not sure *how*. Later in the day, our GM needed to discuss this situation with the airline, and so headed up the hill, and who should she meet there, but Barry. Another confrontation ensued, with much *sturm und drang* on both sides. It was perhaps not the climactic moment, but my second favorite of this whole episode, where my manager proclaimed to Barry **\"You are SUCH a LOSER!\"** Complete with the finger-L laid on her forehead. Yes. Friends, this happened. There is a reason I have worked at this property for twenty years.\n\nAlthough they would not pay for Barry's room, and certainly not the damages he caused (four rooms were out of order for two weeks afterward), the airline did refuse to let him fly. How he got home, we do not know.\n\nNow we enter the realm of the movement of corporations and law. Our owners (locals, but with quite deep pockets) elected to pursue legal action to force Barry to make good on the damage he had caused. It took quite a bit of research (during which we discovered that evidently Barry owns, or at least works for, a consulting business: a **safety** consulting firm, if you can believe it) to track down Barry's wife. We believe if she is not yet, she soon will be, his **ex** wife. She had been trying to serve him divorce papers, but he had eluded her, as he had us. (When our GM got hold of her and began to explain the situation, she cut to the chase: \"He was drinking, wasn't he?\") Our manager had a lovely chat with her. We also tracked down his gradmother, whom he was apparently living with, or at least sending \/ receiving mail through (as you are surely aware, a measure common among consulting professionals), to send him notification of our expectations.\n\nTwo weeks after his stay, Barry called the hotel and ended up getting hold of one of our employees with a name similar to that of our manager, and engaged in some verbal abuse. Evidently he had drunk-dialed us. Barry is obviously not known for his judgment. Unfortunately, this is where our story takes its sad turn. For though we could surely wring no small amount of damages from Barry, if we could only get him to the courtroom, he seems to have gotten away. Leads on his 'consulting firm' have not panned out, any other avenue we pursue has gone nowhere. No fixed address for himself or his business, makes him a pretty slippery customer. So friends, I must inform you that unless a sudden and dramatic reversal occurs, this is where our Tale concludes. The only justice Barry received was that meted out in person by our General Manager. Perhaps there's a lesson there. Perhaps not. In any case, rest assured if there are updates worth making, I shall gleefully inform you all. In the meantime, remember: don't take baths drunk, don't fall asleep **in** a bathtub... And **especially** do not fall asleep, drunk, in a bathtub, *with the water running.* Otherwise strangers will make fake Internet points off your idiocy.\n\n**TL; DR: Drunk guy falls asleep drunk in a bathtub with the water running and causes several thousand dollars worth of property damage, after which he gets away scot-free, however he does get yelled at repeatedly by my manager, and it's hilarious.**","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677872349.0},{"title":"Refunds for power outage from high wind storm?","author":"Many_Gap3869","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11ho6fc\/refunds_for_power_outage_from_high_wind_storm\/","text":"We are currently dealing with high wind and a partial power outage in the building.

We\u2019re a smallish hotel, so we\u2019re not heavily staffed, but when things get hectic, it helps to have multiple people at the desk\u2026 one answers phones, the other checks people in, blah blah blah. \n\nI was juuuust about to clock out for the day when some of our guests were entering the hotel\u2014a woman and her 3 or 4 kids in tow. My coworker noticed she looked a little upset as she was speed walking through the lobby. She got on the elevator, but a couple of her older kids stayed behind. \n\nVery shortly afterwards, a man came to the desk asking for a key to her room. I recognized the man from when they all checked in together. My coworker did not. Her spidey senses were tingling\u2026\n\nShe asked for his ID, as she should. His name was not on the reservation (we can call it laziness on my part and absent mindedness on the guest\u2019s part). My coworker offered to call the lady to see if she could let him up to the room, since people need a key card to use the elevator. The man got mad and walked away. By sheer luck, the two older kids were getting on the elevator, so he just followed them up. Not much we could do about that since he didn\u2019t pose an immediate threat. \n\nA few minutes later, the entire party came back down to the lobby. I was headed to the back to grab some supplies when suddenly I heard my coworker yell \u201cOOOO!!\u201d I ran out to see what the problem was. \n\n*\u201dHe just hit her! In front of her kids!\u201d*\n\nAww hell\u2026 \n\nSo my coworker and I had a decision to make. And that decision was to call the cops. The guests had already left the lobby, headed to the parking lot, so we didn\u2019t even say anything to them. The dispatcher said they would send someone out. Almost immediately after the call, 2 other guests came to the desk to report a lady being hit in the face in the parking lot. \n\n**YES, THIS MOFO HIT HER AGAIN.**\n\nThe lady went back to her room and the guy took off somewhere. When the police arrived, we told them what happened, and then sent them up to talk to her. It had to be maybe two minutes later that the cops came back down saying she didn\u2019t wanna do anything about it. But they told us if he came back, we could just call them back and have him escorted off the property. \n\nBut wait, it gets more annoying!\n\nThis lady had a couple more days left on her reservation. I had not seen the guy inside the hotel since that incident. The lady had been making herself scarce as well. We figured it was from embarrassment.

I soon learned that she had been sneaking around the side of the hotel to let him in and\/or go out and see him. I was so disgusted with her, but I reminded myself that this wasn\u2019t my business. All I knew was that I was still gonna call the police if I saw him back inside. \n\nThe day of her checkout proved to be difficult for the lady as she was still resolved not to use the elevator and risk being seen by the front desk.

I knew it would be pricey - it ended up being just under $500 for two 80 minute massages - but I know the service is fantastic and it was what she wanted and deserved!\n\nThe massages were indeed amazing and the facilities were everything you\u2019d expect them to be for that sort of thing. We were really enjoying ourselves and went to lounge by the heated pool. We decided to order some food, which you can do by calling room service. The room service menu is pretty limited, but nice. \n\nHere I have to explain that my sister and I are both gluten free (medical, not personal choice) and she has additional allergies. We are both also lifelong vegetarians, although this is no longer really an issue in our country or in places like the States or the UK. \n\nWe are extremely aware that this makes us very annoying diners and we both avoid eating out because it\u2019s often a bit of a headache. When we do, we both try very hard to limit questions or requests, and to be satisfied with whatever a place can do to accommodate us, even if it means just having a plain old side salad as a main. We have both worked extensively in customer service (I have waitressed specifically) and know how it goes, so we try as hard as we can to be nice and as not demanding as possible. \n\nUpon looking at the menu, I saw they had a GF Mac and Cheese (this is extremely rare and super exciting so I nearly didn\u2019t believe it!) and a sandwich on GF bread that looked tasty. My sister wasn\u2019t quite as easy, but saw a salad she could have. She also wanted to inquire about corn vs. flour tacos and if she could have a certain side. \n\nMy sister made the call and prefaced it by apologising that we would have some questions. She first asked if the Mac and cheese was actually GF and the girl on the phone said yes so I was thrilled! That and my sandwich ordered, that\u2019s me sorted. She then asked if the side she wanted was GF, as it wasn\u2019t noted on the menu, but usually would be (it\u2019s VERY common at least where we live for things to not be noted as such when they are). The girl asked her to hold, but she didn\u2019t actually but the call on hold, instead just put the receiver down. My sister heard some shuffling and background talk, and then the following occurred:\n\nGirl (muffled but clear, in our local accent): well this lady is asking for so much bullsh*t! (Then after picking up the phone in a customer service, non regional accent) Hello!!\n\nSister: (still cheerful, but quite surprised) Wait, am I the lady? \n\nGirl (pretending not to hear her): hello? Hello?\n\nSister (less cheerful): seriously, am I the lady asking for so much bullshit?\n\nGirl: click.\n\nMy sister was very upset and hurt and wanted to just not order food or anything else, but I decided we should call the front desk and discuss it. My reasoning for doing this is that a) we deserve to be able to ask a couple questions without rudeness and b) this resort is a famous rep of our country and the type of tourists they cater to would not tolerate this - this sort of attitude is getting more common in customer service here and it sucks. I work in tourism and our reputation is important to me. \n\nI called the front desk and asked to speak with a manager, the lady who answered said she was one. I explained the situation and she was horrified and said she would investigate. She then asked if we had made our order, and I said no because we were hung up on. She asked if we\u2019d still like to and I said that I was rather hungry but was concerned about any kind of pushback from the girl in question. She asked who I had spoken to and I told her I didn\u2019t have a name, but it was a (probably) young woman of our nationality. I also explained it may be difficult to take our order as we still had a couple questions and didn\u2019t want to trouble her, and she said she wouldn\u2019t know the answers but was more than happy to find out. I explained our order and asked one question, and she said she\u2019d call back. \n\nFive minutes later the phone rang and the lovely front desk lady informed me that the GF Mac and cheese didn\u2019t exist and my sisters question was a negative. She offered a alternate to the Mac, which I declined (still had the sandwich!) and took my sisters new order. This phase was not without its issues, as she didn\u2019t know the menu - but I expected this and kept asking her to please stop apologising as she was going above and beyond. She said she\u2019d call again and please stay by the phone.\n\nShe called back soon after and said she had investigated the situation. As follows:\n\nManager: I have spoken to the girl in question and she says that she wasn\u2019t speaking to your sister but venting her frustration over the chefs not being able to accommodate her questions. However, this is not an excuse for profanity, and it is a resort policy that staff not use profanity on property for any reason, and for that I apologise. This is an awful situation for you and I\u2019m sorry she used profanity with your sister. \n\nMe: I appreciate your apology and your efforts to resolve the issue! However I wish to make clear that my complaint is not her use of profanity, I myself swear like a sailor and that alone wouldn\u2019t bother me at all. My concern is that what you have said isn\u2019t what happened. I completely understand that may be what she said, or what you need to tell me, but I want to make clear my concern was feeling and not the phrasing, as it upset my sister a lot. \n\nManager: I completely understand and I apologise again, I really don\u2019t want you to feel unappreciated.\n\nMe: you have done all you can and I know how these things go, thanks again for your efforts and apology! \n\nShe then asked to speak to my sister, and apologised to her. My sister explained how hard it is for us to order food sometimes and how badly we feel, but it was really upsetting to be spoken about like that. She then thanked the manager, who told her the food would be there soon and let us know if any further feedback. \n\nThe food arrived about 30 minutes later, mine was delicious. My sisters was very good, but not overly filling for a nursing mum. No one\u2019s fault at all! We were given a 15% discount on the food before service charges and grats. The man who brought the food told us the discount was \u2018for not being able to hear us on the phone and disconnecting the call.\u2019 I have been given a greater discount for less fraught issues, but I was pleased to be accommodated and ultimately would not have cared discount or not since the manager made it clear she was concerned. \n\nMy boyfriend seemed to think I had made a big fuss over the whole thing. That being said, he always thinks I make a fuss even if I simply ask if something can be GF if it\u2019s not noted. My sister is still upset and feels like we deserved to say something, but it wasn\u2019t worth it. I feel confident in what I said, but I wish I had explained to the manager that I too work in customer service and I too complain to colleagues about my guests ALL the time - I just make sure they don\u2019t know about it. I have no issue with the girl in question complaining about us (I\u2019m sure it happens all the time, no matter how polite we are), but us hearing it isn\u2019t great. \n\nAlso, I wonder if my elaborating that I didn\u2019t care about profanity but did care about the real issue came across how I intended it (I\u2019d never complain just about someone swearing, and especially not directly to me) or if it came across as me just being nit picky, which I didn\u2019t wish to be. \n\nThoughts? Karen or nah? \n\n*note - I only refer to her as the \u2018girl\u2019 because the manager did. I originally called her a woman, but I never saw this woman, and for all I know she really is a girl. It\u2019s very common for us to refer to someone even my age (29) as a \u2018girl\u2019 so it\u2019s not a big thing, but I know it is in some cultures. Also, I only made note of her using our local accent because it is clear she wasnt speaking to my sister. My sister sounds somewhat American, I sound more \u2018local\u2019, and the girl used a very customer service version of our accent with my sister, as did the manager with me until she realised I was local, when she then switched to a stronger accent. This is normal for us in any interaction, but it strongly shows to me that the girl definitely didn\u2019t know my sister was listening and also let\u2019s me suspect we would have been treated differently (better or worse, not sure) if we were tourists or not local.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677710487.0},{"title":"The One with the Private Citizen","author":"sparkletippytoes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11f0ert\/the_one_with_the_private_citizen\/","text":"Obligatory \u201con mobile\u201d notice yadda yadda.\n\nTealdeer: Sovereign Citizen Karen demands privacy.

If you are unwilling to meet that requirement, I will not proceed. \n\nK: THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!! Who owns this hotel?\n\nM: {insert hotel management group name\n\nK: No, WHO owns it?!

So long as you hand me your ID and I can verify you are in-fact the guest who rented this room for tonight.\n\nK: I already told you! I expect privacy!\n\nLe Sigh.. \n\nM: Ma\u2019am, since you are unwilling to provide proof of identity, I cannot and will not proceed. However, because you are a valued member and we are grateful for your loyalty, I will cancel this reservation without penalty once you make a case through Larryott member support, and you can find accommodations elsewhere that will meet your particular need for privacy.\n\nK: Fine.\n\nM: Wonderful! It sounds like we\u2019ve found a resolution. There is a cozy lounge just a few steps that way, where you\u2019ll also find our bartender who\u2019ll mix you up something lovely, if you\u2019d like. You\u2019re welcome to relax in there while you arrange your next accommodations for tonight.\n\nK: No. \n\nM: I\u2019m sorry?\n\nK: I\u2019m going to stand here until I find somewhere else to stay.\n\nM: Ma\u2019am, I need you to step aside so that I may be readily available to assist another guest. Unless you\u2019d like to order a beverage at the bar, there is no more business to be had between you and this hotel.\n\nK: No! I\u2019m not leaving here until I\u2019m finished!\n\nM: Ma\u2019am, I am asking you kindly to please step aside so that I may conduct my job. As you are no longer a guest of this hotel, I\u2019m now telling you to leave this property or I will have no choice but to call for someone to assist you in doing so. This will be your only warning.\n\nK: You\u2019re terrible at your job! What\u2019s your name?! I\u2019m going to have you fired for being so unprofessional! \n\nM: My name is SparkleTippyToes!

At this point I\u2019m burnt and just want this interaction to end, so I relent to this small victory and ignore her until she\u2019s ready to leave.

I assumed this was why his key stopped working. In this guest\u2019s case though, his key didn\u2019t work because he was supposed to be gone (according to the system). But me being a dummy, I didn\u2019t actually check his reservation, so I just reactivated his key and sent him on his way. That had to be how he got back in. And I\u2019m sure he believed this whole time that his reservation ended the next day, so everything was normal to him. \n\nIt is weird though that he left NOTHING in the room between checkout and when he got back. No clothes, no paperwork, nothing to indicate that he was coming back. And with the room listed on the housekeeping boards, no one had a reason to believe he\u2019d be back. \n\nAs far as I know, this guest is blissfully unaware that this situation even happened.

A lot of strange, annoying, and infuriating occurrences that piled into just a bad week.\n\nSo, I'm a night auditor, and Wednesday is my Monday. Last Wednesday, a blizzard was blowing through the upper Midwest, giving 9-14 inches (23-35 cm) of snow to most places.\n\nThe manager and assistant manager were staying at the hotel and acting as skeleton crew, but I still come in as normal because I've had to drive 40 miles in a blizzard before, so a few miles up a plowed street seemed like child's play. What I wasn't ready for was my assistant manager and general manager being shit faced drunk, ONE OF WHOM WAS OPERATING THE FRONT DESK.\n\nI don't like drunks. My dad was an alcoholic and abused me heavily. You have to talk to drunks a certain way to avoid their emotions turning on a dime, and I don't have the emotional bandwidth nor the monetary incentive to babysit.\n\nThey made a bunch of lewd remarks about each other (both are women and had been friends for ten years before coming to the hotel). I'm a bit of a prude, and have had bad experiences with an ex-coworker complaining about her sex life to me, and just wish they would leave me alone to start my shift. Instead, they order dinner and force me to eat with them in the breakfast room, where I can smell the booze seeping out of their pores. I don't like talking to people. I took the night audit because it minimized the number of people I have to talk to. This is every nightmare scenario rolled into one and it's my SUPERIORS.\n\nEventually they left, after begging me not to tell HR. I hadn't said anything, but they must have known how drunk they were.\n\nThursday night, I lost my debit card. Sucked. But on the plus side, the winter storm had passed enough that the roads were mostly cleared and the usual evening shift was in. I almost hugged him, I was so happy. But the elevator was down and not getting fixed until morning. I got some belly aches from the upper floors, but assured them it would be fixed and they'd be compensated. However, one guest on our upper most floor got the short end of the stick, because he was in town to go to the hospital, had a huge wound on his leg, and was using a walker.\n\nThe part that pisses me off about this is that the GM and AGM were both using first floor handicapped rooms.\n\nThen comes Friday. Up until now, there's been some players missing. Bar sports. Not gonna specify which, but one of those where they get VERY drunk while playing. We had a hotel full of them and they harassed me all night. One of them complained about not being allowed to use the breakfast room to drink in after 11, because it's closed, and then I had to chase him out of there again at 4 am when he tried watching TV in there. He said he was watching the weather (it was F*x News, which notably does not have a weather segment). He finally went in again at 6:15, 45 minutes before breakfast was set to start, but technically the room was open to the public at that time, staring me dead in the eyes as he did it. Somehow, this drunk man stayed up all night after spending the previous day drinking from morning to night.\n\nThen Saturday, the night that turned this from a moderately annoying week to a \"I should have stayed in college\" week. I should have known it was cursed when I'd heard the elevator broke down twice more.\n\nI was sitting at the front desk. Our one permanent resident walked up. Now, not many hotels have permanent residents, but they're usually old people who are too wealthy for a retirement home but still need to be taken care of.\n\nThis man, stone cold sober, started complaining to me for over an hour about how he's not allowed to say \"n*gro\" anymore, and dropped the N word, hard R and all, multiple times in the lobby. This is a 76 year old white man, using racial obscenities in the middle of a hotel lobby, while people are walking behind him. And I am forced to sit there and listen to him piss and moan about made up BS. And then he went into a rant against Muslim people.\n\nNo matter what your politics are, racial epithets are not ok in a business.\n\nFinally, I managed to shoot my family group chat a single message: call me\n\nAnd thank Christ, my brother called me.\n\nThe resident got a little comeuppance, though. Sunday morning, the elevator finally went down permanently, with him inside. He was in there for about five minutes and the idiot forgot his cell phone in his room because he doesn't \"like to be glued to it\". YOU'RE OLD, YOU NEED A THING TO CALL 911 WITH, YOU IDIOT. His time in the elevator sadly was not long enough to reflect on his life choices, but just a little karma.\n\nAny of these days alone would just be a forgettably bad day in a normal work week, but the whole of them was rotten.\n\nI spent most of my weekend sleeping and fighting a cold before I go back into the breach tonight.\n\nPray for the boring nights, and relish them when they come.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677685592.0},{"title":"Odd lady makes me close inventory and put up our No Vacany sign.","author":"toadTHEBlTCHdette","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11f2qjh\/odd_lady_makes_me_close_inventory_and_put_up_our\/","text":"I'm working audit tonight and around 12:30 or so a large truck pulls up from next to the lobby and its rather busy and truthfully I just heated up my food after I thought the initial rush was over.

Then she started making these awkward gyrating\/jecking motions but was also singing.\n\nI cracked open the office door and heard nothing even though she was no more than 15ft away. For the way she was jamming I'd expect to hear music. I figure when she was done doing whatever she was doing she'd book a room or, I strongly felt, book online.

They refused housekeeping for the first couple weeks. Finally, they let us go in. Our housekeepers probably should\u2019ve worn hazmat suits given that room was basically a biohazard.

I\u2019ve gotten to be pretty good at it, considering all the shit I\u2019ve dealt with over the past 2 years. Here\u2019s tonight\u2019s scenario:\n\nA guy walks in around 9pm to check in. He\u2019s a digital check-in, so all the \u201cwork\u201d of checking him in has already been done by the morning shift. All I need from him is his ID. I hand him his keys, and he\u2019s on his way. \n\nTwo minutes later, he comes back down with all his stuff, saying someone is already in the room. *Tf??* This is the kinda crap that always happened at my last hotel (I should really post more stories about that hellhole). My current hotel is usually more thorough than this, so I\u2019m incredibly confused. \n\nI go ahead and switch rooms for the digital check-in guy\u2014he actually ended up in one of our suites and I gave him some extra rewards points for the inconvenience. Then I start doing my research. \n\nThe last guest in that room was a guy who was only supposed to stay 2 days. Today was the last day on his reservation. He was fully checked out of the system this afternoon. I call the room to see if anyone is there. No answer. I make my way up to the room to get eyes on the situation (not my favorite thing to do alone\u2026 that\u2019s another story \ud83d\ude2c). The room is devoid of people, but is indeed still occupied: open suitcases, a laptop, an unusual amount of tumblers on the counter. So in my mind I\u2019m like \u201cAww shit, we got a squatter!\u201d I go back downstairs and I make a new key card for that room so it locks him out. \n\nAfterwards, I sent an email to my GM and FOM to let them know what happened. But then I did some more research. Turns out, the guy initially made his reservation to check out tomorrow. But, in an attempt to modify his stay for him to check in a day early, his whole reservation got shifted over instead of extended. So instead of having the reservation for 3 days like he wanted, it was still for 2 days with a checkout for today instead of tomorrow. \n\nSo I just reinstated his reservation. \n\nBut still, a **LOT** of shit had to go wrong for that to happen. The room was definitely on the schedule to be cleaned today. The assigned housekeeper never went to the room. The executive housekeeper didn\u2019t inspect the room or even go to see if it was empty. Exec reported to the morning shift that all rooms were vacant and clean, so morning shift took her word for it and assigned to room to a digital check-in, which sends the guy a notification that his room is ready when it wasn\u2019t at all. \n\nIt\u2019s always satisfying to me when I can figure stuff out like this.

Nope nope nope. \"You need to tell him to leave. We have an obligation to keep our guests safe.\"\n\n\"He's not bothering anybody.\"\n\n\"I don't care.

I'M A GUEST!\"\n\nWe go back and forth like this for about 5 minutes; he insists he knows the manager (he doesn't), that he has a right to be here (he doesn't), and that he's going to get me fired (spoiler alert: he doesn't). I keep asking him to leave, but he keeps yelling. Eventually he stands up, tips over, and stands up again.\n\nI hold my hands out and open, universal sign of \"Let's not start nothin' here\" and ask him again to please leave. He pulls out his phone and starts recording me; I pull out my phone and call the non-emergency number for the police. The entire time this man is yelling that I've assaulted him. I give the police his description, and even take a picture. They tell me to leave him alone unless he becomes violent.\n\nI tell him the police are on their way and he's welcome to leave. I left him standing by the chair across the lobby, and stood by the entrance, assuring guests they were safe and that the matter would be handled.\n\nThe entire time I'm doing this old scraggly is recording me, yelling at me from across the lobby. The governor is going to come arrest me, he's gonna own the hotel, lizard people, birds aren't real, blah blah blah. \n\nOur lobby has two entrances: the main front entrance, where I was standing, and a side entrance guests can use their keycards to enter. A guest starts to enter from the side entrance, and he is immediately on them when they walk in. \n\n\"HEY THAT MAN ASSAULTED ME, THAT GUY WHO WORKS HERE JUST HIT ME!\"\n\nI'm across the lobby in a flash, putting myself between him and the guest (she's an old battleaxe of a retired police officer and repeatedly stays here, so she wasn't scared), and his nasty stanky fingers actually touch my face. On instinct I slap the piss out of his hand, knocking his cell phone across the lobby, and I start raising my voice. \n\nI tell him to get his phone and get out of my lobby, or I'll skip his ass across the parking lot myself. He runs and grabs his phone, and I'm able to herd him outside. Now he's really going off. Apparently I've broken his hand (the hand holding the phone), he's gonna own the hotel, Governor Andy Beshear is going to come personally arrest me. I'm still telling him he needs to get off of my property or when the police show up I'll have him arrested for assault and trespassing. \n\n\"No when the police show up they're gonna arrest you! You hit me two times! I got it on camera!\"\n\n\"Okay big man! If you are so sure the police will arrest me then stick around! Go stand on the sidewalk and wait for them to get here! They'll be more than happy to review the footage of our security cameras inside and outside.\"\n\nI see the xannied-out little hamster in his brain start running on that wheel; he didn't realize there were cameras, he didn't realize literally every second of his life for at least the past 25 minutes had been recorded.\n\n\"I don't have to stay here! I can leave!\"\n\nYEAH DAWG THAT'S WHAT I BEEN SAYIN'!\n\nSo he finally walks off. The guest who he approached had followed us outside, and I asked her if she was okay. She laughed, said she was fine, and that I handled that about as well as someone could expect to.

The tale of Dave, Anna and Chloe","author":"Kwecks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11e5uo1\/hope_to_never_see_you_again_the_tale_of_dave_anna\/","text":"Hello! If you remember me from the Katherine story, here is another tale from the (B&B) Front Desk that might prove that not everything is sunshine and rainbows here. I hope this isn\u2019t too long - I just thought I\u2019d take the time to tell you a story about the other side of hospitality - one that we don\u2019t run into often around here (luckily), but if we do, it hits all the harder. Yesterday was one of those days. But let's recap first. \n\nA few weeks back, my partner and I had CoVid. One of the families booked within that time frame requested a date change to Feb. 25 - 27th, which I was happy to apply. I'll call them Chloe and Dave Hughes here. They also have a 12-year-old daughter, let\u2019s call her Anna.\n\nThe only issue with the Hughes\u2019 arrival on Saturday was that we had a village meeting in our common room that evening. Part of village life is that we sometimes host gatherings - in this case, it was a prep meeting for the village flea market with around 20 people attending. It was important that my partner and I attend in person as well since part of it will be held on our property and there is some red tape that we\u2019re eager to iron out. The day before check-in I gave Dave a call explaining all this and asking for their approximate arrival time so we could work something out. He was friendly enough on the phone and told me he\u2019d get back to me, but never did.\n\nSaturday. Of course, they hadn\u2019t shown up by 5:30 pm, so I made them a welcome envelope with room keys and a welcome letter, which I put in our lockbox outside and sent Dave (who didn't answer his phone) instructions via email + sms. Both my email and the welcome letter mentioned the meeting, and that we'd be happy to help them with any further questions and breakfast bookings via email - or in person after 8 pm.\n\n6:45 pm. The meeting was in full swing with lots of ideas thrown around when the doorbell rang. Thrice. Must be important, I thought and hurried outside. \n\n\"Hello, we have a booking.\u201c  \nThe guy was stocky, bald, and clean-shaven, his head looking a bit like an egg wearing glasses, but maybe that's just me being unkind. His wife Chloe - in her early forties with a jet black pixie cut - stood behind him, looking like she just bit into a lemon, the corners of her mouth turned downward in disapproval. A little off to the side, daughter Anna was on her phone, looking bored like only (pre-)teens can. Uh-oh. Spidey senses tingling I switched on my friendly mode, trying for damage control.\n\n\u201eWelcome! Chloe, Dave and Anna Hughes, correct? Let me just get your key from the bo...\"  \nHe didn't quite let me finish my sentence, waving the key and welcome letter in my face. \"Yes. We got it, but have a few questions.\"  \n\\- \u201eUh, we actually have a meeting right now, but let me show you your apartment and \u2026\u201c  \n\\- \u201eThat meeting, does it mean we can't use the common room?\"\n\nThis guy clearly wasn\u2019t someone to let other people finish their sentences.   \n\u201eDon't worry, Mr. Hughes\u201c   \n(I was in full-on distanced, but polite mode now. With 95% of our guests we\u2019re on a first-name basis. Not the Hughes.)   \n\u201eThe meeting will be over in an hour. You\u2019ll be more than welcome to use the Common Room afterwards, as well as all day tomorrow.\u201c  \n Chloe tutted, while Dave just muttered something unintelligible. Anna was still on her phone, oblivious to the world. All right then.\n\nOn the way to their apartment (with a living room and kitchen - not sure why needed the common room so urgently) it turned out they wanted to know about breakfast - which I had already outlined in my welcome letter. Oh well. They proceeded to book breakfast for 9 AM, then took up another ten minutes or so asking about activities (which are all described in our welcome booklets as well as on our website). Clearly, all this was much more important than my meeting - in their eyes anyway. I missed the tail end of it, but I'm told my partner had our questions covered. \n\nNext morning. Sunday, 8:30 am. We\u2019re in the middle of serving the first round of breakfast when in walks the Hughes Family half an hour early and none too happy that their table isn\u2019t ready. They order eggs three ways (boiled, over easy, scrambled). And because they\u2019re one of *those* families, once breakfast is in front of them the following conversation happens between Chloe and my partner, who has been spared the whole difficult-for-the-sake-of-being-difficult spiel up to this point.  \n \u201eExcuse me! Do you have cherry juice?\u201c  \n (Note: cherry juice is not common for breakfast in our country. At all.)  \n \u201eI\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t. I can offer you more orange juice or breakfast juice?\u201c  \n \u201eYou don\u2019t understand. My daughter Anna (who is, once again, on her phone, oblivious to the sunny day and snowy hilltops outside) has an iron deficiency and needs red juice for breakfast.\u201c\n\nI\u2019m bussing two tables over and only just manage to turn my snort into a cough. My partner, being much more diplomatic than me, actually offers them a freshly made smoothie. They decline and leave in a huff. It\u2019s a beautiful day outside, sunny with snow dusting the forests and hills. The stream right in front of our door is tinkling and the first birds of the season are in full song. One can only hope they\u2019ll come back in a better mood. Personally, I take the time for a lovely, two-hour afternoon hike with the dog and come back refreshed and happy. \n\nAlas, it\u2019s not to last. Sunday, 5 pm. My partner is downstairs showing other guests our Sauna and Hot Tub, which they have booked for the evening. The guest bell rings three times. Uh-oh.  \n Of course, it\u2019s the Hughes. They insist that they have a Sauna booking. I tell them that I am very sorry indeed, but there is no note of that in the system. I even offer them a drink on the house by way of apology. No dice (and no cherry juice). Once again they leave in a huff. \n\nNow this one actually turns out to be partially my fault (I\u2019m being generous here). After having changed the dates for their booking, Chloe sent us an email asking to reserve the Sauna for \u201eone of the evenings\u201c, but didn\u2019t specify a date or time frame. Due to having Covid, I apparently never got back to her (not my usual style at all!). How they construed that mail as an actual booking - your guess is as good as mine. Clearly, we\u2019re just not seeing eye to eye here.\n\nMonday (bloody Monday!), 8:30 AM. The Hughes show up for breakfast early again without letting us know beforehand. Ha! I actually figured as much - and it\u2019s no hassle since we have just one more table anyway.   \n \u201eDo you have cherry juice yet?\u201c  \n Anna clearly is her parents\u2019 child. Yesterday was Sunday and the village shops were closed - which she would be very aware of.   \n \u201eSorry. What would you like instead, maybe a smoothie or hot chocolate?\u201c  \n \u201eUgh. (Gotta love these pre-teen noises of disapproval. The world surely must weigh heavy on your shoulders.) Fine. Give me hot chocolate.\u201c  \n   \\- I get it. \u201ePlease\u201c and \u201eThank you\u201c clearly are too much to expect from the Hughes. \n\nAfter having served everyone, I ask if anyone is interested in feeding the chickens (the other table has two pre-teens as well - who are jumping at the chance. Chicken-feeding and petting is often a hit with the city kids.) Chloe gets her phone out and urges Anna to come with me. More noises of disapproval, but she actually gets up. Dave puts on his jacket and actually comes with us as well. \n\nOur small group heads outside into the garden, where the chickens are happily gathering around me - they are smart enough to know they\u2019re getting food. I take a second to explain that the kids can take kitchen scraps from the bucket and throw them on the ground for the chickens. Whoever\u2019s brave enough can also hand-feed them from open palms (as demonstrated by me), they might sometimes peck fingers though. I also show them our tamest chicken, which is happy to be petted. The city kids are loving it and are taking turns petting while being very gentle. Chick seems to be enjoying the attention. \n\nCue Anna taking a fist full (quite a lot for one go!) of salad scraps and lowering her closed hand between the eager chickens. Predictably, she gets pecked - and starts screaming. Not crying (it can\u2019t hurt much, there isn\u2019t any blood either), but screaming like a banshee. Dave is angry and actually\u2026 KICKS ONE OF MY CHICKENS. \n\nA grown ass man. Kicks my chicken. With his hiking boot.   \nThe poor thing run-flies out of there in a panic, cackling in protest. He then stomps the ground and flails his arms, making the other chickens follow. It isn\u2019t until much later in the day I manage to catch the poor kicked chook and double check that she didn\u2019t break her wing or injure anything else. Much to my relief, she seems fine. At the time of writing, she\u2019s happily foraging outside with the others.\n\nBack to the moment after the kick. That\u2019s it, my limit has been reached. I ask the Hughes testily to step inside, away from the other guests. Anna refuses to have her hand inspected and cleaned and runs off, presumably to tell her friends about the big, bad monster chicken that pecked her. Still no tears. \n\nI call my partner for back-up and tell Dave and Chloe that I would like them to leave my property within the next fifteen minutes since they just unnecessarily abused one of my animals (and made other guests\u2019 kids witness it). Chloe waves her phone around, threatening to get the police involved since my chickens are clearly dangerous. I snort out a non-professional derisive laugh at that and dare her to - two of our local police people have chickens themselves and we know the whole department. Still, not my proudest moment. My partner, my rock, pulls me aside and tells me to go and cool off - he\u2019s got it handled. I follow his advice and go to the kitchen for a well-deserved coffee, so I actually have no clue how he got them to leave. He did, though - twenty minutes later I see their car speed off, hopefully never to be seen again.\n\nHonestly, even after a day of cooling off, looking back to 14 years in tourism and hospitality, I have NEVER been more angry, disappointed, or annoyed with guests. Even before the whole chicken incident, they managed to push every single one of my buttons. I just can\u2019t stand inconsiderate, arrogant, moody and impolite people. I like to think that I am none of the above towards my guests (whom I highly appreciate) and would like the same courtesy extended to me... To quote Anna here: \"Ughh!\" Let\u2019s just say this one will stick with me for a while. Which I HATE because we have so many more amazing, funny and heart-warming moments with guests, which should count for more than the bad ones. But right now\u2026 I am still angry. I might head out for an extended hike again, since we have no check-ins. Just wanted to share, since this is such a lovely community and I could use some words of encouragement right about now.

He gave her Id and a Credit card and said he has 2 rooms and he would like to cancel 1 of his reservation. They had a separate reservation with the group block as well so total 3 night stay for each reservation.  I had to step in and informed him that we won't be able to cancel the reservation for free as it was the day of arrival and the cancellation policy is 3 days prior to arrival. I got ready for a fight the moment I said those word because you know from the beginning he looked and behaved like he was not having a good day. He informed me that if he can make a reservation then he can cancel the reservation if he would like to anytime he wants. So again I refused to agree on that. I again informed him about the cancellation policy and showed him a contract signed by his leader and then he tells me that he travelled all around the world and never heard of a cancellation policy in life. If he doesn't want to stay, he shouldn't be getting charge for that room. on top of that he said he even tried to cancel the reservation few days ago but we just hang up on him so it was our staff's mistake that I couldn't cancel this reservation so give me my money back. I just gave him my general manger's card and said I won't be able to help him with anything else if he would like he can contact his leader or my general manger. \n\n1 of the other group member stepped in and I had a argument with her as well. I told her the same thing as I said to the male Karen after few words she go to her room. But but but, She came to the desk right after she saw 2 beds in the room. She needed a king size bed as you all know it was a  sold out night so I had to break that news to her. she asked me why I was booked into 2 queen size bed. I said your leader blocked room with 2 queen bed only and I am the one who made a reservation for you and I always make sure that I confirmed with the guest what room they are booked in once I get all the information needed for reservation.

The hotel was a 600 room 4 star property in Chicago. Heavy arrival day with about 300 arrivals, more than half of these were third party bookings for one night. \nOur hotel required a $200 hold for incidentals, no cash no exceptions. You know where this is going\u2026. \nIt happened time and time again, couple tries to check in and is shocked to learn about the incidental hold, we go back and forth, some tried their card and it declined. Lots of bruised egos. Several left to \u201cgo to the bank\u201d and never returned. It was very awkward and I had to turn away roughly 10 couples who were super pissed at me. I don\u2019t make the rules sorry.\nThe worst was a guy who blew up about this policy and became very rude. I always handle myself professionally and can handle conflict easily. He and his girl leave and actually come back an hour later. He turns the corner and says \u201cnot this f*ggot b*tch again\u201d then tries to check in with me at my desk.

This is his story. It\u2019s a bit lengthy, but trust me, it gets better and better (or worse and worse, depending on your reaction to the crazy shit he did) as it goes on. \n\nJoe comes in one Winter afternoon in December saying he lost his wallet and needs somewhere to stay. He says he doesn\u2019t expect us to let him stay for free- he\u2019s currently waiting to see if he can get a prepaid visa from a local store or something. Okay, sure, whatever. He sits in the lobby and plugs in his phone. And I wait.\n\nAn hour later, I hear him in our little marketplace next to the front desk, so I come out to see what\u2019s up. He\u2019s sitting on the floor with his phone plugged into the nearest outlet. He talks to his friend on the phone for awhile, and I get annoyed by him sitting around for hours talking on his phone without any visible effort in getting a prepaid card. He ends the call, and I ask him for an update. He says he has the money in his account. He just doesn\u2019t have a physical card. I ask if he has a virtual card, and he said yes. I told him that I could input the virtual card information manually if he had the money in his account. He insisted he did, so I did that. And his card declined. Multiple times. And he gets angry and says \u201cyou didn\u2019t tell me I\u2019d have to pay NOW.\u201d I explained that it\u2019s an authorization hold to ensure that the money was there. He said he never agreed to pay NOW. \n\nJoe calmed his ass down a little bit and said he\u2019d text his friend and ask if he could send pictures of his (Joe\u2019s) other credit cards. Y\u2019know, the ones he said he lost. Three more cards, three more declined transactions. Then he asked if his mom could pay. I said sure, as long as she filled out a CC authorization form. Joe called his mom. She refused to give him an email address for me to send the auth form to her. And she said she wasn\u2019t paying for shit. And hung up on him. Joe disappears into the bathroom for a solid 20 minutes. My guess is to do drugs tbh. \n\nWhen he comes back out, he calls his mom again to plead for money. She demands to talk with me. Not over the phone, either. She demands a video call. He asks me to talk to her, and, believe it or not, it wasn\u2019t the first time someone has called their parents and asked me to talk to them lol. But usually those people aren\u2019t 31yo like Joe is.\n\nAgh, fine, whatever, anything to make this guy stop bothering me like he\u2019s been for hours already. His mom video calls, Joe hands me his phone, and I can\u2019t even greet her before she says, \u201cdo you REALLY work at (hotel\u2019s name)?? And is Joe REALLY there?\u201d\n\n\u201cEr.. yes ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay. Well, I just needed to make sure because Joe lies to everyone all the time. Always screws people over.\u201d\n\n*\\*Joe standing at the front desk, nervously laughs:*\\* \u201cthat\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants me to pay for his room. How much is it.\u201d\n\nI tell her the price, say I\u2019d need an auth form from her, and explain our incidentals hold.\n\nShe let out an incredulous laugh and said, \u201cthere\u2019s no way in HELL I\u2019d ever pay for his incidentals. He fucks shit up everywhere, and I\u2019m not going to take responsibility for his mess. Sorry he\u2019s wasting your time.\u201d\n\nAnd then she hung up and I gave Joe\u2019s phone back to him as he nervously said, \u201cheh, she doesn\u2019t really mean all that stuff she said.\u201d \n\nUh huh. I said, \u201clook, I\u2019m sorry, but if you can\u2019t provide a valid source of payment, I\u2019ll have to ask you to leave.\u201d And then, because he made me feel anxious, I made up an excuse so he didn\u2019t pin his anger solely on me (and so he was aware of the cameras and possible witnesses) and said, \u201cmy boss already texted me and asked why someone was loitering in the lobby for hours, so again, apologies, but you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d \n\nHe got pissed and said, \u201cLOITERING?! I\u2019m a guest trying to find a valid form of payment. And you are telling me to *leave?* Why the fuck didn\u2019t you tell me this hours ago instead of wasting my time?\u201d\n\nAnd he stormed out. And stormed back in 20 minutes later saying his dad was on his way and would be there in 5 minutes to pay for a room. And Joe paid for a snack and sat down in the lobby. Five minutes later he went to the bathroom for a suspiciously long time. Came back out. And then left before I could tell him to leave again.\n\nAwhile later, I was reading the local news and found out that he\u2019d been arrested less than a month later. And then assaulted two officers in jail. I looked into his criminal record, and hoo boy\u2026 in the past couple years, he\u2019d been charged with drug possession\/paraphernalia, harassment, retail theft, theft of movable property, receiving stolen property, unauthorized use of motor vehicle, conspiracy relating to the auto theft, tampering\/fabricating physical evidence\u2026 and some of those events happened multiple times. Like. He stole a car and then a few months later stole another car. And committed retail theft multiple times.\n\nWhat most recently got him in jail though, was how he physically assaulted his sister, harassed her, screamed at her, and eventually pulled a fucking gun on her.\n\nAnd while he was in the county jail, there was an incident where a female officer was passing in his meal tray, and he reached through the bars and grabbed her breast. Hard. And wouldn\u2019t let go. She called for help, and a male officer came running. And Joe, with his other hand, grabbed the male officer\u2019s wristwatch and ripped it off, along with a big chunk of the officer\u2019s skin with it. They had to fucking taze this guy to make him let go of the female officer. So there\u2019s four more charges tacked on. \n\nAnd I haven\u2019t heard anything since then. I assume he\u2019s awaiting a hearing in jail. But man what a shitshow. I feel lucky he didn\u2019t hurt me, seeing that I was the only one working in the hotel that night.

Gather around, friends, and let me tell you the tale of the soccer team and the wedding.\n\nPicture it: a branded select service hotel, filled with the delightful combination of a kids soccer team and a wedding party. One side of the lobby was occupied by the energetic young athletes, while the other side was taken over by the wedding guests, who were busy enjoying a few adult beverages at the bar. All was well, until one of the groomsmen decided to order a ton of pizza for the wedding guests. Hey, no judgement here, we've all been there. But after realizing he had way over-ordered, he thought it would be a generous idea to give some of the leftovers to the soccer team.\n\nWell, the Best Man didn't quite catch on to the whole \"generosity\" thing, and thought that the soccer team had taken the pizza without permission. So he did what any reasonable adult would do, and started yelling at a group of innocent 8-year-olds. Classy move, buddy. Needless to say, the parents of the soccer team were not too thrilled with this display of adult tantrum-throwing, and a physical altercation was about to break out.\n\nBut fear not, for the whole two employees on property were quick to the rescue! We quickly jumped into action and deescalated the situation before it turned into a WWE-style brawl. The bride and groom were appropriately apologetic, but let's be real, they can't be held responsible for the actions of their overgrown, pizza-obsessed friend.\n\nAnd there you have it, folks. In all my years in the hotel industry, I've never witnessed anything quite like a grown adult trying to pick a fight with a bunch of children over some pizza.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677278057.0},{"title":"Weekly Free For All Thread","author":"marmothelm","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11bcj8t\/weekly_free_for_all_thread\/","text":"Want to talk about something that isn't a front desk tale?

I've been working in my current hotel for 9 years. But I've been in the hotel industry for about 15 years. That aside, I found out that the new person I'm training was getting more money than me. Now, keep in mind, I never asked this young man what his salary was. He volunteered the information as he believed our hotel was doing the old bait and switch. If you know then you know. And I thought to myself, this is so unfair.\n\nSo, a few days ago, I requested a meeting with my GM to discuss a pay raise through text message. In the request, I asked that it be just me and her. And I left it at that. I knew that if it was her and two other managers, things would turn ugly. As time grew near for the meeting, I wasn't to hopeful and texted her this morning that I wanted to cancel. And I didn't pay it no mind. I arrived at work today and was met with friction and attitude from the assistant manager. I should have known something was up when she said \"you wanna come in the office and talk to US?\" US? who the hell is US? I should have said no but...Anyway, another asst. manager had overheard me and the new guy talking about our pay days before. and he relayed that info back to the gm and the other assistant manager. \n\nYa'll, it was like I was being ganged up on. These two heffas, insulted me and offended me and then had the nerve to pour on the gaslighting like it was lotion. When the assistant manager told me \"if you don't like how we do things, you can leave\". I imagined myself beating her ass like Ike beat Tina. But I tried my best to hold my composure. She kept over talking me and interrupting me. And when I returned that same energy, she gaslights the hell out of me following the GM backing her up and allowing her to do so. \n\nAnd OMG, I had the nerve \\*rolls eyes\\* to try and record some of the conversation for which they both didn't like. I recorded the conversation with the desk and wall for background...just in case. With this they both threatened me and my job but by then I had stopped recording. They told ME that MY PAY was confidential and it was illegal to discuss it with anyone; which I reminded them that it was MY pay. and them threating me for discussing it was the illegal part. I even googled it and showed it to my GM who  simply said \"I don't care about that\". Ok, Ms. Thang.  \n\nAfter the argument was said and done, for which most of it, the GM took the asst manager's side of everything, the GM told me she's giving me a raise. I went through all of that just to end up STILL getting a raise. The assistant manager stormed out, slammed her office door, got in her car and left. Even after getting my raise, I've been kinda salty with the GM because I felt she allowed that bitch to verbally attack me. \n\nAnd....hours later, the manager who overheard me and the new guy talking, had the gall to call and try to gaslight me again. How did he know what was said in that meeting without him being there!?! was one of the points I was trying to make in the meeting. No doubt in my mind, they're probably having a phone conversation about me right now as I type this. And I expect my assistant manager, who writes the schedule up, to retaliate against me next week by taking all of my days off the schedule. \n\nBTW. I told my GM my expectations of the assistant manager in regards to her retaliating against me as I witnessed her do just that to a former employee in favor of a new employee. She put the girl on the schedule for only one day per week making her quit. And then a week later, the new employee did a no call no show and bought her uniforms back the next day. I took a picture of the government post about workplace retaliation in front of the GM so she'd get the hint that I'm done playing their stupid games.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677210379.0},{"title":"The wholesome tale of Katherine - an unusual guest that I judged way too soon!","author":"Kwecks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/119yu0e\/the_wholesome_tale_of_katherine_an_unusual_guest\/","text":"Hello again. It's me again - a B&B owner that mostly has wholesome stories to share, and I thought I'd post another today to hopefully make you smile. \n\nThis last week we had a guest, let's call her Katherine, who turned out to be one of those people we're not likely to forget any time soon. Katherine is in her sixties and upper middle class judging by her clothes, sports car and extensive plastic surgery, which tends to give her unlined face a look of perpetual slight surprise. She had booked a studio with a kitchenette and breakfast, because she wanted to experience the snow and our mountains are the best bet in a five hour driving radius. No idea what brought her to our humble B&B, rather than to one of the four and five star resorts in the area, but she turned out to be genuinely loveable.\n\nBut let's start from the beginning, her arrival. Unfortunately, climate change is real, and these last few winters have been serving a lot more rainy days, storms and grey skies than the snow-covered, blue-skied winter wonderlands she was probably hoping for. Katherine arrived on a singularly rainy day and came in rather drenched after the 30 second walk from her expensive sports car. On first glance I couldn't suppress a bit of a smile - her business shoes, skirt, blouse and fur trimmed overcoat were pretty far removed from the oftentimes mud-drenched hikers, dog owners and young families from the cities we usually get here. Misjudging her arched eyebrows, I took her to be surprised (perhaps negatively) and half-prepared myself for a walkout. \n\nWhoops. I was quite wrong there. Turns out this was her happy look - she complimented our common area, which doubles as breakfast room and has a self-serve bar, reception and fireplace. Granted, the latter is intentionally extra cozy on dreary days. Having been shown her room, she was quite content. Now, normally we don't offer daily housekeeping, but I decided to ask her if she'd prefer that. \"No, no, I'm fine, I actually prefer it if I can just leave my own mess lying around for a few days.\" She told us she'd just let us know if she needed anything. A woman after my own heart. \n\nThe next few days, Katherine was decidedly different from our usual guests, at times a bit eccentric, but always polite and genuinely fun to be around. She forgot her toothbrush and paid us well to get her a new sonic one on our shopping run (\"do you own a sonic toothbrush? I just need that feeling of clean teeth, you know!\"). \n\nKatherine's Breakfast consisted of two eggs, fruit, mozzarella and cheese, but no bread. Flat White with Oat Milk. Oh, and a cigarette on the patio after. In the evenings, after having had dinner somewhere, she'd often buy a bottle of wine from our bar, never without offering us a glass, too. \n\nWhen she expressed her disappointment with the weather (it remained stormy and rainy throughout her stay) we quickly came up with alternative activities. National Park and Natural History Museum, a tour through a historic mine and a spa day. We even booked her a driver from the village so she could sample the local Liqueurs and Spirits. \n\nKatherine being Katherine, she befriended a young hiker couple - let's call them Len and Tina - from another room one evening over a bottle of wine or two. The next day, they all went shopping for outdoor clothing in Tina's beat up little car, since Katherine's two seater couldn't fit them all. Katherine left in white trainers and her fur trimmed coat, only to return with new top of the line hiking boots, trousers and an insulated winter & rain coat that cost decidedly more than a week's stay with us. She even bought Len and Tina a pair of gloves each (the smallest item they could come up with when she offered to buy them something, as  they later told me). \n\nTo her credit, the very next day she put those hiking boots to good use and joined Len & Tina for a hike that would take 5 hours on a good day - they came back after 7 - wet, muddy and happy, especially after we brought out the hot chocolate. Later, Katherine discreetly asked me for band-aids and disinfectant - apparently she hadn't been aware that hiking boots should ideally be broken in with series of shorter hikes. Her blisters had gotten so bad that they burst. The next day, feeling sorry for her, I bought her my favourite blister pads. That afternoon, she actually bought me a bottle of Riesling (she knew it's my favourite by then) to say thanks.\n\nKatherine checked out this morning - after having kissed me and my partner on both cheeks three times, thanking us profusely for \"a great hidden gem that you have created here\", leaving a very generous tip and promising to come back. Not going to lie, I was genuinely touched, but didn't think anything would come from it.\n\nWhat can I say... she wasn't lying. Just now, I received a phone call from Katherine's personal assistant. They have booked the entire B&B - 24 people (including some bunk beds - I triple checked and was assured that's fine) - for a family get together. They'll stay a full week in October and have asked me to work out a bespoke itinerary that's quite eclectic - including an informal, vegetarian pizza night in our garden as well as a high end Michelin Star Restaurant visit in the next town over (I already called them, they're happy to open specifially for Katherine's group on a specific date). Additionally, the PA asked me for Len & Tina's contact details, since Katherine wants to hire them as dedicated hiking guides & photographers for a day or two (they have a semi-successful hiking themed Instagram). I called Len - he had a good laugh and will talk to Tina, since he'd absolutely love to make it work. Shorter hikes this time, he promised.\n\nGuys... All the feels. With the risk of being cheesy: It's days like this that I genuinely love my job. It'll never make me rich (unless Katherine would like to buy the property? Just kidding!), but the services we offer make people from all walks of life genuinely happy - and to me that's even better.\n\nPS: I know this is the wrong thread (sorry Mods, hope that's okay), but thank you again for all well-wishes from this lovely community when we had Covid (see my last post).

For reference this story took place at a Resort property\u2026 enjoy! \n\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOne morning I received a report from a Room Attendant that she had found a couple of articles of clothing in a room that had been marked as vacant. She followed protocol and turned them into the Office, where I was present.\n\nSuddenly I heard yelling down the hall. I quickly realized that a guest was in the room in question, screaming at the top of her lungs that we had stolen her belongings. I immediately went to the room to address the situation, but the guest was already in a frenzy.\n\nShe was not just yelling, but full-on screaming, making it impossible to reason with her. She accused us of breaking into her room and stealing her belongings, despite the fact that the room was marked as vacant and the clothing left behind were minimal.\n\nThe situation was extremely tense and volatile. The guest was unresponsive to our attempts to calm her down or reason with her, and she refused to listen to reason. It was clear that her anger was irrational and out of control.\n\nThe guest slammed the door in my face, with the deadbolt out. The door bounced off the deadbolt so hard it was damaged beyond and repair and had to be replaced. \n\nRight after this guest and her husband went to the Front Desk, where they continued their rampage. They were screaming, shouting, and being verbally abusive to the staff. Their behavior was disruptive, and it was affecting other guests as well.\n\nAs they were finally leaving, after being told to go at least three times, husband almost got into a physical altercation with another guest who said \u201cjust leave man\u201d. He had to be physically restrained as he started aggressively walking towards the other guest and basically pushed out the door while law enforcement was called. \n\nAfter they were finally gone and the poor people at the Front Desk had finished crying we started doing some investigating. I wanted to know how my boards showed the room as vacant when the guests were oh so clearly still here. Turns out, and it should come as no surprise, the guest had checked out IN PERSON at the Front Desk and then went to breakfast, and then back to the room. They had already loaded most of their stuff up, which is why we only found a couple things, not enough to make us think they were still around. \n\nOverall these were the worst guests I have ever encountered, and I have had my fair share. Nothing compares to the level of disrespect, aggression, and just overall anger that they both exhibited.

He spent hours in the waiting room for a VERY minor complaint, snapping at us about the wait (Critical Care was SLAMMED all day and constant arrivals through both the waiting room and the ambulance bay), loudly moaning or wailing, and making snide comments to us across the room or to anyone who happened to sit down near him.  He wants pain meds, he wants food, he wants blankets, he makes us run around getting every little thing that strikes his fancy.\n\nAt long last, he was slated for discharge.  He makes a big show of limping up to my desk and spits out, \"When are they giving me my paperwork?\" with a huff.\n\n\"It'll be very soon, but the nurse is juggling a bunch of things right now so it might be a minute.  I'm sorry, I know you've waited a long time today.\"  I try to be nice just because I know he's leaving soon, but my patience has almost run out for this guy.\n\nHe then refuses to leave my desk (which really needs to be kept clear and unobstructed for incoming patients) and glares daggers at my nurse the whole time, all while she's discharging another patient and fielding phone calls from other medical staff.  She prints out his discharge paperwork while she's still on the phone, and places it on my desk in anticipation of going over it with him as soon as she's done with her phone call.\n\nHe sees the papers and condescendingly says, \"Ugh, it's been ready this whole time?\"\n\nI'm done.\n\n\"You are not the only patient that the nurse needs to take care of right now, so you don't need to come at her with the attitude,\" I tell him in my best teacher voice.\n\n\"I didn't,\" he says.\n\n\"Yes, you did.\"\n\n\"I was just asking.\"\n\n\"Yeah.  With an attitude.\"\n\nHe didn't argue past that point, thankfully.  I'll put up with a lot of crap directed at me, but I have especially little patience for people who treat my nurses like dirt.\n\nAfter he was given his papers, I watched him limp away on the security cameras.

Renovation is currently happening and it was desperately needed. Management kept up business with our corpo contracts but stopped listing with 3rd party sites. Thank goodness! Loyalty program members are still allowed to book here and they have been a nightmare. Nearly all of them lie that they were not made aware that heavy construction is happening and attempt to get their stay refunded.\n\nWell, one of our largest accounts is a giant international retailer. They use our property for their corporate events and treat the hotel as if it were just dorms for their personal abuse. They also have a habit of lying to their employees about what the hotel is like, promising far more than is possible. I guess they have problems enough coercing world-traveled professionals to come stay a week in a cult-addled southern backwater. So, they tell these guests we are like a 3 star hotel when that is FAR from reality.\n\nThe shuttle service.  The retailer tells their executives to just call the hotel once they disembark from their plane.  Well guess who does not and never has had a shuttle vehicle to the airport? So here an executive in sales or tech is being forced to travel thousands of miles from Spain or Taiwan or Abu Dhabi, and their own employer lies to them that a car will pick them up. Only to find out they must scramble to book an Uber on the spot, late at night, in an area that does not have taxi services or public transportation, at all. And, It's very far out to the airport, like a 30 minute ride.\n\nSo at midnight I had such a young woman come barreling through our doors, already quite pissed off. Her employer pushed the hotel hard for her to be able to stay here. The retailer did not want to adjust their calender, had this event arranged last year, but waited until the final weeks to try to book rooms. Finding that we are down by 2 entire floors, they begged and pleaded and harassed until our managers agreed to make it work. Maintenance and the renovation crew busted their butts pushing up the time table especially for this young woman and her peers.\n\nOf course she does not know this, but I guarantee that if she did it would not matter and she would STILL complain. Not 5 minutes after getting her checked in she returns to the desk, very unhappy. She wants to move rooms. I apologized, telling her that the retailer booked her group very tightly at the last minute; there are no spare rooms, the construction crew worked very hard to get what we have ready for her.\n\nWell, she is not happy to be staying in the hotel in such a state. She was not told there would be construction dirt in the main halls and the elevator. Her room feels uncomfortable because the paint is TOO NEW. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Her room would be beautiful but it looks like it was rushed and just doesn't look right. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!\n\nSo tomorrow morning bright and early she is calling their corporate liaison to demand a meeting with the hotel managers. To see what can be done to rectify this affront. You see, she is a professional, and must conduct networking sessions during the day time. How can she possibly work and invite her clients to our property when it looks too new?

Until our last GM (that lasted all of 2 months) favorited her and made her think she could get away with anything. One day she was three hours late to shift. I worked from 11pm to well after 9am. (and Tammy \"clocked in\" on the sheet at 9am so sus.) When I left after the GM got there to relieve me Tammy still hadn't arrived. Both were late for their shifts.

I gave an awkward laugh, but didn't say much more. It felt like she was taunting me. Making fun of me for having stayed late? She continued on and on about her sleep and how wonderful it was. So, I closed out my shift and I decided to remove myself from the situation like a grown adult. I know my temper and I would have said something if she kept going. Clearly, she wasn't done.

Would whistle and hum until she could clock out and leave. There was no communication. Then she got her promotion. Now officially FOM, she couldn't be told anything. Her ego was through the roof. Except. . . she couldn't be contacted outside of her 9-5 shift. and she expected to be clocked out and able to leave at 5pm.

It got serviced, but the external devices like our credit card terminal and the printer need to be reinstalled. I have had that note on the computer for WEEKS. TAMMY WAS THERE WHEN I PUT IT UP- we had discussed it! So, I put it in the website we use, just to make sure either she or the new gm starting this week sees and gets the computer fixed. I end it with \"i put the note up a few weeks ago\" nothing bitchy, just stating facts. Instead of calling me about the post, she calls my coworker. \n\nTammy: Travis! Hey, is there a note on the computer?\n\nTravis: Yes.\n\nTammy: Hmph. Well has it *really* been there for weeks?\n\nTravis: I don't know the exact day, but it's been there a while.\n\nTammy: Well I havent seen it.\n\nTravis: Yeah- it's bright yellow and it has (reads off the list)\n\nTammy: Well- that's not my job. \n\nAnd they go on to chat about the problem and she has Travis look into it quickly. THEN she posts under mine and acted like she checked into it, and that she was completely unaware of the issue- but also implying she knew about it and was working on a solution?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I go to check in a few reservations that book for the day before because they come in at 6am. I see a bitchy note on the reservation. Granted, I did move the reservations because originally they were supposed to check in yesterday, but didn't. I remembered a discussion i had with another member of the group and realized it wasn't just ONE reservation that needed the dates adjusted, but all of them. so i fixed it for the TOP tier member that stays here weekly and has been for months now. But I dont get the issue (mainly because she never came to me directly). I can't no show them to get payment becuase of the type of reservation. and i knew they were coming in. WHATS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CANCELING THEM AND JUST fixing the mistake? Am i really supposed to cancel them just to remake them a minute later?\n\nShe has no idea who these people are or that they're regulars.

I don't work a specific shift, sometimes I work a 12 hour day shift, sometimes a 12 hour night shift. Weird shit always happens during my night shifts.\n\n*Note: SI units are used*\n\nChapter I: The Jacuzzi Bandit\n\nOne of our guests booked said wellness area for one hour from 9 to 10 PM and immediately complained that there were no bathrobes and that my supervisor (here from 9 AM to 9 PM) had promised her that there would be bathrobes which seemed odd given that we do not provide any at this hotel, fortunately he hadn't left yet so I asked him and he denied ever promising her anything like that.\n\nFast forward ten minutes, she comes to the reception (without clothes and with just a towel around her) to complain that the jacuzzi is \"ice cold\" and asked whether I can raise the temperature, she berated me about it and said that \"Jacuzzis are supposed to have at LEAST 42 degrees!\" which seemed a little off, but alright, I went in after she told me to change the temp and cranked the thermostat on the jacuzzi to 40 degrees - the highest it would go. At the time it was at 33.5 degrees.\n\nAfter another ten minutes she called to tell me that the water is still not at 40 degrees, I tried to explain that since the jacuzzi holds 300L of water, it would take either an incredible amount of energy, or an incredibly long time to heat the water by 6 degrees. She emailed me a link to a google search of \"how hot should jakuzi water be\" [sic] which itself confirmed, when you clicked on the first search result, that the temperature shouldn't go over 35 degrees if children are in the jacuzzi, **(She brought 3 children with her, the youngest being 8)** and anything over 40 is dangerous to even adults. (So much for \"Minimum of 42 degrees\") \n\nAfter her hour was up she marched to the reception with a smirk on her face and a phone in her hand to I guess \"own\" me with facts and logic with a google search result that said the **average** jacuzzi temperature is 37 degrees. I had calculated the amount of energy and time needed for fun earlier after the last phone call and tried to yet again explain that it would take a while to reach 40 degrees. She told me that we should have checked before they went in if the temperature was right. **(Completely ignoring the fact that different people have a different idea of what the \"right temperature is\" Hell, the thermostat is accessible to anyone who rents that room, so the previous renters probably turned the temp down because they thought it was too hot.)** One gem of a line was \"Didn't they teach you in biology class that anything below 37 degrees is legally considered cold water?\"\n\nShe continued to verbally abuse me including telling me that a dumbass like me must have flunked middle school and bragging about how she has a Masters degree and started recording me on her phone despite me telling her that she can't do that - We were on private property after all and this was way past the line of harrassment at this point. She replied that she can do \"whatever the fuck she wants\" especially if she's going to use the recording in court. Yeah_Ok. Afterwards she went to her room only to call me not even five minutes later to let me know that one of the lamps in her room is unplugged, \"come plug it in.\" For sure, I will!\n\nSo I knocked on her door, she let me in and I walked to the unplugged lamp, tried to plug it into the radiator, tried to plug it into the bed, and then said something like \"Aw shucks, a dumbass without any education such as myself can't do something so complicated, I have no idea how any of this works.\" Only for her to start verbally abusing me again, I responded simply that if she really had a Masters degree, she'd understand how to plug in a bed lamp. She started yelling at me to get out and that she won't listen to this abuse in front of her kids and started to shove me out of the door. I had peace for the rest of my shift.\n\nChapter II: The Aftermath (tm)\n\nRight after my shift ended she walked up to the day shift to complain about me, from what my colleague told me she told him and management the following:\n\n* I was harrassing her.\n* She was afraid of me and so were her kids.\n* I have access to their personal details including their address and I could come hurt them anytime.\n* She is going to notify the police because I threatened to harm her kids.\n* I am a dangerous psychopath.\n\nAnd to this I raise the following:\n\n* Being refused a full refund after you were caught lying twice AND fully used the service is not harrassment\n* If she was so afraid, why did she keep seeking me out to yell and abuse me, not to mention call me to her room for an absolutely mundane task?\n* We only store addresses of foreign nationals, which means, no, I do not know the address of a local Karen such as you.\n* The \"threatening kids\" part is an absolutely vile lie and shows just how disgusting she is as a person.\n\nSo here I am, at 2:40 in the morning of another night shift contemplating whether I should go to the cops after my shift ends and report her behavior as slander, given that she has lied to management in an attempt to (I guess?) get me fired.\n\nTL;DR: Karen wants refund after using a service, doesn't understand basic physics, yells and abuses me, calls me an idiot, then lies to management that I'm planning to hurt her kids.\n\nExcuse me for any typos\/grammar mistakes, I was trying to get this out of my system ASAP and then get back to work.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676944847.0},{"title":"We Met an Angel","author":"pneighthan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/117jntt\/we_met_an_angel\/","text":"TL:DR AT BOTTOM\n\n  I worked in the restaurant industry for 14 years, so I know customer service. This is a thank you to all who go above and beyond in the hotel industry. \n\n  Several years ago, my wife and I traveled to the Florida Keys. As my restaurant wouldn't allow managers to take a vacation in the \"-ber\" months, we went in August, before students arrived in our town. \n  \n  We landed in Miami and rented a car. Even for off-peak season,  traffic was bumper to bumper on the two lane road connecting the islands. A long drive. We were staying on Islamorada, the halfway point through the Keys. A friend recommended an inn. It has less expensive stamps. So glad we didn't have to drive all the way to Key West that day.\n \n When we got to the inn, we were informed that our room would be ready in an hour. Cool. We parked, walked over to one of the outdoor bars, got a specialty cocktail, and just enjoyed not being in traffic. We admired the empty pavilion, commenting on how packed it would be this time next month. One day we'll be able to travel when we want to. \n  \nAfter a cocktail, or two, we got checked in and headed to our room. It was a little hard to find, but we made it up the couple of outdoor flights of stairs and around some corners and walked by it a couple of times (it wasn't spaced like the rest of the rooms.) The room (shoe box apartment size) has a double bed, a bathroom, and a TV hanging on a half wall. On the other side of the half wall was the largest closet space we'd seen in a hotel. There was enough room to sleep two on the ground.  The actual space was small, but, we were there to see the sights. This would be fine. Only one problem. The air conditioner is running full blast, but the inside temperature of the room was only a couple of degrees (\u00b0F) lower than the outside temperature. It's Florida in August. It's hot!\n  \nWe call the front desk, and they apologize and let us know that an engineer will be over shortly. About 20 minutes later, we get a knock on the door, and a man in his late 50s introduced himself. Enter the angel. We'll call him George. George tells us that the AC is probably frozen. He then discloses that he doesn't know why they rent this room out. It's a converted utility room, and the poor design of the half wall blows all of the cold air into the \"closet area.\" He turns the AC off to let it defrost and tells us to turn it on in several hours, and that should take care of the issue. Cool. Problem solved. \n  \n  We go to a local seafood place for an amazing dinner, then dancing at a shag bar. (The shag is a southeastern American dance style.) We get back to the room, turn on the AC and spend the night sweating on top of the covers. Yeah, it's hot in Florida. We call the front desk again in the morning. George comes back. He tinkers with the AC, mumbling and grumbling. \"Give me a few minutes.\" He says. \"I can't make any promises.\" Sure, do what you gotta do. He comes back twenty minutes later, seeming very apologetic. He's mostly upset that we have the hassle of having to move to another room. He assures us that it's the same style of room, and that the rates will be the same. (We're staying for another five nights.) I take the new keys, a little incredulous. George, what have you done? My wife thanks him graciously with the idea of a room that's not 85\u00b0 (over 29\u00b0 C). She doesn't know the room number yet. \n  \n  We thank George again, and he leaves us to get our belongings together. As we're heading to our new room, my wife asks if I know where the new room is. I got ice the night before and had a walk around, so I know the layout. I tell her there's another spot of rooms that seems like ours on the other side of the inn. We'll need to go up some stairs again. \"As long as it's cool,\" is her reply. We get down the stairs, cut through a bit of parking lot, and walk under a breezeway. I stop. \"Honey? You okay?\" \"Yeah,\" I smile. \"This is our room.\" She looks at me, as incredulously as I looked at George. We open the door to a king suite with a kitchenette and full bath. Beach front access past our patio. George, what have you done?!\n  \n  We get settled in, and I go out for a smoke. I see George on the path. I graciously thank him and chat with him a bit. He tells me he moved to the island 25 years ago and loves his life. That it's nice to help people be happy. He lets me know about a meteor shower in a few nights. That it was lovely meeting us, and that he's sure he'll see us around. That was the last time either of us saw him. \n\n  Thank you George, and thank you to all in the industry who know what hospitality is truly all about. We'll be back when we head that way again.\n\n  Customers, please be patient and kind, sometimes the reciprocation can be immeasurable.\n\nTL:DR Engineer couldn't fix our AC in our double-bed room.

Literally my worst fear since I started this job.\n\nSUPER chill night, had one late check-in I think, and it's the last day until I have my \"weekend.\" 4am is coming around, probably the slowest part of the night until I go make coffee. Then I start hearing this high pitched beep, and just as I realize what it was, a light flashes. Then as I say \"oh f***,\" the alarm AEERRRGGGHHHH echoes throughout the hotel.\n\nI run to the alarm panel down the hall, (the one at the front desk didn't work??) and see it's something with some pool duct. I go to the indoor pool room, and it's humid as hell, but no problems. Go back to the panel, at this point guests are coming down to the desk, going outside, or just calling to ask what's going on. I call my supervisor like wtf? Apparently this happened the other day too and no one thought to tell me! Just seems like a thing that would be nice to have a heads-up about!\n\nI'm trying to silence the alarm, but it keeps going off and the lights are still flashing, so as you can imagine guests are getting pissed. Dispatch calls me, I tell them theres no fire, my alarm is broken and its happened before, and they say the fire department are on the way. Cool. Something I can tell guests to hopefully calm them down lol.\n\nFire department gets there, and they already know more than me about the situation, as they dealt with it a few days prior. No joke, the alarm was going off for a good hour. I was constantly talking to guests, trying to make coffee, talking to the fire fighters and my managers over the phone, it was chaos. Plus they couldn't turn it off like they did before. The fire department finally had to disconnect power to the whole alarm panel to get it to turn off.\n\nSo that gave me the extra job of \"fire watch\" the rest of the morning, had to walk the hotel 2-3 times every hour. That one late check-in I had just walked out of the hotel after asking for a refund. I felt so bad, I wasn't even going to ask for manager approval, I just told her I'd make it happen.

Selected highlights from this call:\n\nCan you send me a confirmation email? Can you send it to two email addresses? My second email actually is actually my show business email, I'm a performer and actually I'm quite well known. In case I don't get the email can you give me a confirmation number? How do I get there from the airport via public transit? After the train stops running what are my options? And how much would that cost? How many days should I stay? Do I need to book in advance if I want to see a show? How about if I want to visit [major tourist attraction in your town]? I still haven't gotten the confirmation email, could you send it again? Do you have any discounts? Do you think the reason I haven't gotten the email is because I'm having bad weather here? Do you think I'll have a good time there even though I'm older? I don't look that old with all the makeup on when I'm on stage, but I am older. I'm so glad I'm talking to the supervisor, you must be older. Why was the kid last night so short with me? That's bad customer service, that would have gotten people fired back in the day. Oh a truck from [Name of Internet Company] just drove by, isn't it funny that we were just talking about my email and that truck drove by? What will the weather be like in October? Should I stay for longer, I was only going to do a short stop on my way to New York, but is it worth it to make it a longer stay? I really love the fall on the east coast. Will you have Halloween events? What is Halloween like there? Will you have Halloween events two weekends before Halloween? Do you have anything like [event in east coast town i've never heard of] in your town? Should I fly X Airline? I'm really used to the VIP treatment and I don't know if X Airline would be right for me. I still haven't gotten those confirmation emails, could it be the storm? Just one more question... Just one last question...\n\nNow notice he never asked me any wildly inappropriate questions... but that was one LONG ASS PHONE CALL. At around the 24 minute mark part of me wanted to say \"maybe the reason our overnight person was so short with you was because 20+ minute conversations with the front desk agent are NOT NORMAL\" and another part of me was like \"hm, maybe you're not 70+ year old sex offender\" (he certainly did not sound 70).\n\nAfter I hung up I finally get the presence of mind to look up his name in our system again, but this time spelled \"Brian\" with an \"i\" and not a \"y\" (again, this is just an example and not his actual name). Apparently this dude has been **banned** from calling our central reservations department for tying up the phone line for extended periods of time and also asking inappropriate questions. I'm also able to glean that he has in fact stayed at one or more of our other properties, so he's not just all talk... but I also find out from a coworker who now works at another property that he also called there and tied up *their* phone line for an hour and a half!\n\nMeanwhile I text my manager: \"I did a bad thing.\" Within 24 hours my manager, who gets shit done, convinces the company to put a nationwide ban on \"Brian\". \"Brian\" is contacted and told that we will no longer be honoring any reservations for him, etc.\n\nBut no, gentle reader, the story doesn't end there!\n\nToday \"Brian\" calls back the front desk (with his number blocked from our Caller ID) and asks for me! He wants to ask about a reservation he says! This time I'm ready.

You could say I have a passion for what I do, I love all my coworkers and I absolutely love making all my guests happy and satisfied.   \n \n  Today I just clocked in on this lovely Sunday afternoon. My GM was filling me in on information on how her day was going and all the normal shift changing things. I had this wonderful lady come in from out of town and she asked to see a room. Soo of course I give her a limited use key, take her ID, and give her directions on where she can find her room.   About five minutes later a local comes in. Now I know most hotels don\u2019t rent out to locals (and I can\u2019t even imagine how many locals we have on the DNR, cause since I\u2019ve started working here, I know I\u2019ve put at least 35 people on that list) but we\u2019re one of the few in my town that do rent out to locals. She comes in and this is how the exchange goes.   \n\nMe: \u201cHello! How are you??\u201d  \n\nHer: \u201cHi, I\u2019m doing well thank you.\u201d   \n\nMe: \u201cHow can I help you today??\u201d   \n\nHer: \u201cWe\u2019ll I was wondering if I could get a room and if you guys rent out to locals?\u201d   \n\nMe: \u201cYes ma\u2019am we certainly do!

(Property name is a fictitious alias for privacy and subreddit rules reasons.) For about a week we had noise complaints from a guest who I'll alias as Alice.\n\nAlice was in Room 129 and during my days off, she had made noise complaints about Room 130, an adjacent room. Afterwards she would tell us to please not rent Room 130 to anyone else, according to my colleagues' shift email reports.\n\nWell, one late night during my shift, Alice came to the front desk to buy some odds and ends when she repeated the same request to me. I got a chance to break it to her: *Sorry Alice, we aren't going to block off a room from being sold just because previous guests were being noisy in it, but of course if anyone does raise hell in that room, let us know and we'll ~~yeet them onto the parking lot pavement~~ tell them to pipe it down.*\n\nShe pretty much dropped the subject of \"don't rent 130\" after that.\n\nI'm sorry Alice, but hotels (and related establishments, like motels, inns, etc.) are businesses, and businesses by their nature want to fully sell out their product to make revenue. Management would not be pleased to hold back one room just because you're complaining of noise from that room specifically. Also think of it from a customer's perspective: Say you wanted to rent a room at some other hotel just to get some shut-eye, and there was one vacant and clean room left. Except that room was being blocked off so as not to disturb some cranky old guy next door. Would it be fair that that last room is being denied to you just because said cranky old guy thinks whoever gets put in that room is going to be a party animal?\n\nOnly way you would've prevented Room 130 from being rented to someone else was if you rented and paid for that room yourself. Or if that room went out of order for some reason or another, but of course never count on that.\n\nRemember that hotel staff, particularly security as well as front desk at smaller properties without dedicated security, are paid to deal with noise issues among other things. More often not, the hotel you're staying at is staffed 24 hours a day. If noise nonsense happens during your stay, let us know while it's still a problem and we'll handle it.

The hotel I work at is a duel property, so it's one building but two hotels, let's call one of them Inn and the other one Suites because one is more basic and the other is more high-end.  We only have one front desk though, and overnight it's just audit at the desk and security doing rounds or stationed on the ground.  Our main lobby is on the fourth floor and is devided into two lobbies for each hotel.  The front desk is on the Suites side, and aside from some cameras, any FDA can't see the Inn side.  There is a small ground floor lobby with a seating area.  The floors in between are for the garage.\n\nThis happened a couple nights ago.  I usually try to do a walk-through of the Inn side lobby between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM to clean up, check for people sleeping, et cetera.  While doing that around 3:15 AM, I encountered a man (wearing a grey overcoat) in the men's bathroom washing his hands. \u00a0He will be Grey Coat from here on out.  There was nothing odd about it at the time.  I just said 'Good morning' and checked the women's restroom.  While walking back to the desk to finish audit, I noticed a guy at the business center  (wearing a black baseball cap and checkered jacket).  He'll be Checkered Coat. \u00a0The business center is also obscured from the front desk, but it's open 24\/7, so I just made a mental note of it.\n\nI got back to the desk and finished up audit, but I also noticed I hadn't seen Grey Coat on the cameras.  He was washing his hands, so presumably finishing up, but there was no sign of him either leaving or taking the elevators to the guest floors.  Out of curiosity, I decided to review the cameras to see if he came from outside or from the guest floors.  The elevator cameras for the ground and guest floors were reviewed from 12:00 AM until that present time, and he was not seen coming down from the floors or coming from outside.  It should be noted that there is a stairwell, but it's directly in front of the desk.  So this would indicate that he had been hanging out in the Inn lobby, off camera, since at least midnight.  There is no rule against guests doing that, so long as they don't sleep in the lobby, but it's unusual.\n\nWhile I didn't see Grey Coat, I did notice Checkered Coat was seen coming into the building around 12:30 AM and taking the elevators to multiple floors throughout the night. \u00a0When he first came in, he went to the 5th floor, which has the meeting rooms and whatnot, but he also pressed the button for the 17th floor.  He got off on the 5th, but almost immediately got back on the elevator, but instead of going to 17, he went to the 9th floor.  I tell myself that maybe he was just lost.  He popped up a few more times on the camera going to different floors between then and when I saw him at the business center though.\n\nThis only took about ten minutes to review, and at 3:40 AM Grey Coat finally shows up and Checkered Coat meets him at the elevator.  This is the first time I've seen any indication they were together.  Both men took the same elevator to the parking garage. \u00a0Alright.  They're leaving, and I was just being overly suspicious.  But then Checkered Coat got back on the elevator and went to the ground floor at 3:43 AM, leaving Grey Coat in the garage.  Checkered Coat sat on the ground floor, and I left it alone, thinking he would leave soon.  But then, twenty minutes later, here comes Grey Coat, back on the elevator going to the ground floor.\n\nAt this point, I gotta see what these guys are up to.  So I contacted security and had him check on them.  He asked the normal questions, like if they're guests and if they're waiting on something.  They showed him a key card and said they were waiting on a ride.  That's all good and well, but it did raise the question of why Grey Coat was in the garage for twenty minutes. \u00a0Security told me that he had seen Grey Coat around 11:00 PM in the Inn lobby and again around 2:00 AM, but just assumed he was up late.  So I decided to review the cameras beginning at 10:00 PM, but still did not see Grey Coat enter the building or come down from the guest floors.  Now there's no reason why he can't spend all evening in the lobby and on to the wee hours of the morning, so there's not much I can do about it.  Around 4:30 AM, I asked security to check up on them again and ask if they have an ETA on their ride, because at this point they've been waiting for nearly an hour.  I also asked him to see if he could get their names and room number.  They told him their ride was scheduled for 5:00 AM, but refused to give the name and room number. \u00a0It didn't seem worth pressing because aside from some abnormal behavior there's nothing we can really say against them.  So we decided to give them until 5:00 AM before we bothered them anymore.  And, of course, 5:00 AM rolled around, and they left.  So they were probably guests, although you can easily get your hands on a key.  People leave them in the lobby all the time.  Why was Checkered Coat going to all those floors?  Why was Grey Coat hanging out in the lobby for hours?  Why did they leave together, but didn't spend any time together in the hotel?  What was Grey Coat doing in the garage for twenty minutes?  And why would you go to the lobby to wait over an hour for your ride?  And why refuse to give a name and room number when security as for it?\n\nJust to justify myself a bit, we've had problems with non-guests coming in and hanging out or sleeping in the lobby (or even on the guest floors on rare occasions).  Also, not too long ago, someone stole a car out of the garage.  I don't know that there's a point to this story, but sometimes you see stuff at this job that just seems off.  There's no hotel policy against it, but something about it isn't right.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676808795.0},{"title":"Deadly virus at the sail away dinner","author":"AuntieFifi61","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/115gzbr\/deadly_virus_at_the_sail_away_dinner\/","text":"No not COVID.

He spoke a few words to the parents and then he rushed over to the Captain and all of a sudden there were two deck hands escorting the family away and were ordered to sequester them in their cabin until they could figure out what to do.\n\nWe later found out that he asked that boy\u2019s parents if they knew their son had\u2026. Drumroll please\u2026 chicken pox. Their answer was\u2026. Clash the cymbals\u2026.YES. As our nickname stated we had many elderly passengers. The parents excuse was that they couldn\u2019t get a refund and so they went anyway. The airline they flew over on was contacted and they stayed in their cabin for the remaining of the cruise, 7 days, just to make sure the virus ran its course, that no other passengers were affected and to keep them away from the public anywhere.\n\nEdited to add: I posted in this subreddit because a few of the members here wanted to read more stories from my time as cruise ship front desk (pursers desk).\nAlso this was around the time chicken pox vaccines were coming out in the USA. And why it was so dangerous to be in public with active chicken pox especially for the elderly and pregnant women.

On Valentine's Day, we had a high-end room deal with romance packages. There was a generous woman who wanted to get away and her partner is from the army. She booked the suite with a whirlpool tub in it and everything went perfectly smoothly from our in terms of setting the romance packages. I was happy about it. \nApproximately at 10:30 PM, she came crying by the front desk. Apparently, her partner dumped her that evening. I used to be a good listener and advisor when this matter used to happen but then I gained 1 year of experience at the hotel where it was in the middle of an absolute crime hole. It hardened and left me emotionless. I had no idea what to tell this guest and I felt if I say something, then it is out of my professional border. \nWhen I came in for my PM shift, the AM shift front desk agent mentioned about 2 credit cards being captured. One of the credit cards belongs to her boyfriend. Due to my hardened nature, I consolidated her and replied to her I am sorry about what happened to you. I wish I could help you out in a better way. By the way, I see there are two credit cards on file. I can split the bill for you. She started crying more and stormed off. Apparently, my manager just came from his break and saw that. He was kind of hysterical and called me the meanest person at the front desk.\n2 years later I think about this incident. I always question whether I could have dealt with this situation better in an empathetic way but most of the time I just chuckle at the situation off.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1676780355.0},{"title":"Down to the bone","author":"AuntieFifi61","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/115jrzm\/down_to_the_bone\/","text":"Working the night shift at the front desk of a cruise line (or any hotel) is when the crazies come out. Cruise lines sail at night and dock for the day. One night a many hours after pulling up anchor on a rough seas night a deck hand comes to my desk and asks for the doctor immediately. He had traces of blood on his shirt so wasn\u2019t sure what was going on. The doctor meets him in the lobby and the deck hand escorts him to the bow area. We had the pool and poolside bar there. Since is was rough waters that area was closed down for passenger safety. \n\nThe next morning I had to write the report. A passenger had come aboard just wasted out of his gourd and kept drinking in the inner bar until it too closed. Nope he wasn\u2019t done! He gets to the poolside bar and sees all the liquor shut and locked behind a metal grate. Yeah you know where this is going. \n\nWell this bar was set up like most bars with the hanging racks for the glass ware where wine glasses hung upside down. They were barred closed so as not to roll out. Our brilliant guest decides to leap frog over the bar to get to the liquor and upon doing so went just a few inches too high and hits the wine glasses. They shattered and his whole back was spayed wide open right down to his spine. Yep, nope, glad I didn\u2019t have to see that.

A little loud.  A little drunk.  But not bothering anyone other than the misanthropic night auditor, so I ignore it.\n\nI see a little movement, and my Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I kid you not:  One guy(we'll call him Mr. Krispy) is laying on our big marble table.  And another guy(We'll call him Dr. Rice, because I'm going for a naming theme here) is...ooh.  Ow.  Yeah, he just twisted that guy's neck.  I fucking heard that pop.\n\nWell, uh.  The hotel lobby is not the place for that kind of thing.  And not on that table.  With your dirty fucking shoes.\n\nCast will be **Me**, **Dr. and Mrs. Rice**, **Mr. and Mrs. Krispy**, and **Security Guy**(SG, my long haired hippy weekend auditor who is here three other nights a week to support me as sort of security).\n\n**Me**:  \"Uh, guys, you can't be doing that on a table in the hotel lobby.  People eat on that table.\"\n\nThey ignore me.  Mrs. Krispy returns from the restroom and apologizes.  I try to get her to help me get them to stop, but she just kinda shrugs.  Dr. Rice has Mr. Krispy change positions, and in the process, he kicks over a beer bottle.  Great.  Mrs. Krispy picks it up and moves someone's cell phone.\n\n**Me**:  \"Guys.  This is why I said you can't be doing that.  You need to stop now.\"\n\nThey ignore me and Dr. Rice pops Mr. Krispy's hip or whatever.  But they look like they're done and Mr. Krispy gets up.  Ooh, he's wobbly.  Shit.  Please don't let this idiot collapse and die.  The paperwork would destroy me.  But his wife gets him and helps him off to his room.  Maybe he'll die later of an aneurysm.  Whatever, as long as I don't have to hear about it.\n\nSG comes back from a patrol around this point and I ask him to get a mop to help me clean up this spill.  Dr. Rice begins gathering his stuff.  SG gets the Swiffer wet.  I grab the sanitizing cleaning spray and a towel.  I start working on the other end from where their stuff is.  \n\nLet me explain something.  This table?  Pretty damn big.  It has a bend to it, but it's maybe 18 feet long all told?  Could be bigger.  I've never measured.\n\nYou may have noticed that one of the cast hasn't shown up yet.  Yeah.  Here she comes.  Mrs. Rice.  I never asked her first name.  But I'd bet small amounts of money that it's Karen.\n\n**Karen**:  \"You're being very rude.\"\n\nYeah.  Those were literally the first words out of her mouth.\n\n**Me, internally**:  \"Bwuh?\"\n\n**Me**: \"Bwuh?\"\n\nEloquent, I know.\n\n**Karen**: \"You shouldn't be cleaning so close to our stuff.\"\n\nMy dudes, I had stopped spraying about five feet from their stuff, and was currently just wiping with the wet towel about four feet from their stuff.  Their stuff that was closest being a cardboard box.  You know what?  Game on, Karen.\n\n**Me**:  \"My apologies.  But I need to get this area cleaned because someone felt the need to put their dirty feet up on this table, where people eat.  That said, I have not sprayed anywhere near your stuff.\"\n\n**Karen**:  \"YOU NEED TO STOP SPRAYING NEAR OUR STUFF AND JUST LEAVE.\"\n\nI look Karen dead in the eye.  I give her a beatific smile.  I pick up the spray bottle.  And I spray right next to that fucking cardboard box.  Then, without breaking eye contact, I start wiping the table.\n\nDr. Rice starts trying to deescalate the situation.  By telling me that I should go back to the desk and leave them alone.  I look at him, and as my gaze passes over the table, I notice something.  I let my smile drop, and return to a blank, neutral expression.\n\n**Me**: \"Sir, now that I've noticed it, I must inform you that the consumption of outside alcohol in any of the public areas of the hotel is strictly prohibited.  I must ask that you put it away immediately and return it to your room before I'm required by policy to contact the authorities and have you removed from the premises.\"\n\nI'll be honest.  I was pretty sure they were drinking outside alcohol the whole time.  But I hadn't actually seen it from close enough to identify what kind of beer that was.  So I decided that until I could confirm what it was, it was neither my circus, nor my monkeys.\n\n**Karen**: \"Your face is very rude!  Stop making rude faces at us!\"\n\nI look over at SG, maintaining my neutral face.  He shrugs.  I turn back to Karen.\n\n**Me**:  \"Ma'am, I don't understand what you mean.  I'm not making a face.  This is just what my face looks like.\"\n\n**Karen**:  \"Whatever.  It's a very rude face.\"\n\n**Dr. Rice**:  \"Just have a seat and give us a moment.\"\n\n**Me**: \"Of course.\"\n\nI sit down on the chair next to me.  One of the ones at the table.\n\n**Dr. Rice**:  \"No.  Go back to your desk over there and have a seat.\"\n\n**Me**: \"That's okay, this chair is fine.\"\n\nDude gets in my face in a mostly non aggressive way and starts talking to me like a child.  His wife begins talking to me the same way.  I just stare at them, maintaining my blank expression.\n\nThey go on like this for a couple minutes.  Finally, SG decides to intervene.\n\n**SG**: \"Guys.  He's not fifteen.  Stop repeating the same things over and over like you're talking to an unruly teenager.  He's in charge here and you need to show some respect.\"\n\nCue SurprisedPikachuFace.jpg as they stare at him.  \n\n**Me**:  \"I really have to insist that you guys put away this outside alcohol and go to your room, mmkay?\"\n\nDr. Rice finishes gathering his things and they begin leaving, but then, she storms over to SG and gets in his face.\n\n**Karen**:  \"You need to cut your hair and beard!  You look gross.\"\n\nShe made a few disparaging remarks about me as she left.  But whatever.  \n\nSo, yeah.  I'm sure they'll complain in the morning.  Probably not going to help me any that someone wrote in a complaint about me a couple weeks back because they were checking in a little after midnight on Thursday night and I told them that it wouldn't count as checking in on Friday.\n\nI still hate Fridays.\n\n*TL;DR: A guy inappropriately pops his friend's back on one of our tables which, through a series of events, causes his wife to snap at me.*","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676719861.0},{"title":"Finally Front Desk Manager.","author":"cydthescifikid","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/115egi1\/finally_front_desk_manager\/","text":"I have had a rocky hotel journey.

Nothing too crazy, I go upstairs reprogram it all good.\n\nThen, at about 1:34 in the morning, right as I begin my night audit, I noticed that I have a guest with a hanging balance. So I go to try to clear it and of course it gives me issues. Apparently we owed the guest $100, but my system just kept making a negative. Eventually figured it out, and all is well\u2026.\n\nBut in the midst of this happening, I need to call the helpdesk . As I\u2019m on the phone a gentlemen walks in who looks a little suspect but if I\u2019m being honest, didn\u2019t look like any sort of problem. Instantly went to the guest computer, and started playing music really loud. I noticed he was looking for a place to plug his phone, or would look like a phone I think it was a tablet. I expressed to him that there was an outlet at the large table near the fireplace. He then attempted to purchase a beer to which I expressed to him I couldn\u2019t do any sort of card transactions at the moment as I was having a little difficulty. I didn\u2019t notice. He had a bunch of bandages all over his fingers, and he starts to take out stuff from his pocket, that\u2019s when I started getting the homeless vibe. I then ask him if he\u2019s staying here he says \u201c of course\u201d (on a sidenote, I now know to ask for further proof) like why wouldn\u2019t you go to your room to fix up?

Management has now encouraged us to be more confrontational with these guests. We now HAVE to ask the purpose\/task provisions and establish whether or not a pet qualifies, including the distinction of ESAs versus regular Service Animals. That said, a good majority of guests with ESAs end up agreeing that they are not Service Animals and paying our pet fee.\n\nToday though, a guest became the bad example that I will refer to for times to come.

Could you provide an ID and Reservation Number please?\"\n\n**Guest**: \"Yes, I'd also like to let you know that I have a Service Animal with me today.

Small towns being what they are, everybody knows everybody else, and we all have strong opinions about everybody else's business, and any gossip makes the rounds in under an hour.\n\nThe subject of this tale happens to be a local business owner who married a more successful business owner as their business strategy. It worked, and \"Manny\" lived like a very big fish in a very small pond for a good while until his spouse passed away and Manny ran the various businesses he inherited into the ground. He eventually sold most of them off including his hotel which hadn't been updated or repaired in nearly 20 years, which was bulldozed and a new hotel was built in its place.\n\nManny would live off of the money from the sale as well as some rental property income for... a shockingly short amount of time. It took less than 5 years for him to be sighted working an actual honest job at a budget motel nearby. Where did the money from the sale go? Nobody knows, everybody has theories ranging from tax debt to drug addiction.\n\nTime goes by at New Hotel, and the GM here decides that the hotel industry isn't for her, nevermind the Raging Asshole regional manager, so she hightails it for greener pastures. Manny sees the opening and pounces, it pays more money and probably isn't as physically demanding as the honest work at budget motel, and Manny is nearing retirement age. Raging Asshole sees Manny as an obvious choice due to his many years in the industry, so Manny gets the job.\n\nUntil now I had never met Manny, only heard some stories. Not flattering stories. But hey, people change, and even if Manny is still everything they say he is, I'm not going to treat him any differently than any other new GM. Boy did that attitude last long. I came in for a rare morning shift less than a month later and what did I see as I rolled in but Manny carrying out a big box of hotel supplies to his SUV. Before I can even get to the door Manny comes running up to me to let me know that he wasn't stealing. Buddy, I didn't say a word and this ain't my circus, but for some reason you feel a strong need to change any ideas I might have had about you being a thief? That's some serious self incrimination.\n\nLoads more happened over the next year, we got a new regional \"Total Moron\" and Manny drove off all the decent employees. My job quickly became \"show up, clock in, watch videos, clock out\" because none of Manny's hires could do anything right and I couldn't keep my sanity if I tried to wrangle them myself. I did what I could for guests, but kept everything else to a bare minimum. Yes, I was the \"warm body doing night audit\" trope. Yes, I would fall asleep frequently. Fellow NAs you can curse my name any time a guest asks you if they woke you up.\n\nManny had been stealing here and there for a while. Nothing big enough to make the dimwitted regional manager take notice, but it definitely added up. Then came the day I had been waiting for. Manny fucked up so bad that even Total Moron would have no choice but to fire him. Manny entered a guest's room while the guest was away and locked the door behind him. Guest (an older man) came back and was absolutely bewildered that his door was locked from the inside so he started banging on the door and out comes Manny, all apologies and pretending it was an honest mistake. Well, when guest started looking through his stuff he realized some prescription medication was missing and rightfully raised absolutely hell, contacted corporate and left a scathing review.\n\nI was giddy. I was gleeful. I was in a state of pure dopamine induced good feels. The verdict from corporate came down. Manny convinced Total Moron that he didn't take anything, that it was actually a housekeeper who did it.

We have already told him twice to move the car and he has brushed off the requests, after that we will tell him one last time and give him thirty minutes before we call the city\u2019s towing service to come and pickup a car.\n\nI sigh and call the room, when he picks up, I inform that I need to see him at the front desk.\n\nSilence\u2026 then a low mumble of him agreeing.\n\nI wait for fifteen minutes handling a check-in or two before he shows up.\n\n\u201cHello sit are you from room ___, Mr. Kevin?\u201d I greet.\n\n\u201cYeah, what\u2019s this about?\u201d He said, already irritated.\n\n\u201cWell sir, I am sure you\u2019ve already been informed that your car is in our emergency parking area and need to be moved.\u201d I inform him, not taking offense as he had probably been lying down before he was disturbed.\n\n\u201cWhy do I need to move my car?!\u201d He demanded indignantly.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026 it\u2019s out emergency parking area sir. Only emergency vehicles are allowed to park there.\u201d I replied, willing to explain what I thought was pretty standard for hotels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there is an emergency going out right now!\u201d He countered angrily.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t really matter whether or not there is an emergency or not at the moment.\u201d I tell him, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a parking that is predicated on time or whether or not there is an emergency. That area needs to stay clear in case an emergency happens.\u201d\n\nHe sneered and crossed his arms, \u201cSo what are you going to do about it if I don\u2019t move my car?  Huh?\u201d\n\nI frown but he should know the consequence, \u201cI wait 30 minutes before I call the city to tow your car.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour not gonna tow my car!\u201d  He laughed, already walking away.\n\nI level a flat look at him walking away, \u201cAlright.  Bet.\u201d\n\nI do wait the customary 30 minutes that I told him I would wait to see if he would heed my advice and he doesn\u2019t come back.\n\nA small call and interaction with the tow truck driver later and our emergency parking area is clear once again.\n\nWhen he returns \u2014 three hours later \u2014 he looked around in the lot in confusion before realization dawns on his face and he storms back in, scowling and ready to deck me.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d\n\nI look him straight in the eye, \u201cI had your car towed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you were parked in the emergency area.\u201d","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676579583.0},{"title":"Brooooo Today Was a Dope Ass Day!","author":"AngelaIsNotMyName","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/114c3dz\/brooooo_today_was_a_dope_ass_day\/","text":"Today I was planning to go to the hotel on my off day to bum the internet for a work-related call.

So if any of my coworkers are reading this; yes it's me, hi.\n\nTonight gentle readers, we shall speak of sacrifice. To give up that which you most hold dear so that others may continue. And what it means when that is completely taken advantage of. Buttercup the Emotional Support Unicorn is over in her paddock, with a bunch of brand-new spring-themed ribbons, if anyone feels like braiding her mane.\n\nOur story begins one fine afternoon. Your humble narrator is enjoying the day off, and has done some weekly shopping, including some tasty Chinese food. It's a lovely, relaxed sort of day and oh hey, my phone is ringing.\n\n\"Hey [manager], what's up?\"\n\n\"How soon can you get to the hotel? Becca is having a medical emergency.\" There is a tone in his voice I've not heard before - panic and desperation.\n\n'Rebecca' has been working for us for a while, hired during the worst of the pandemic shenanigans. An adequate worker, though flustered when confronted with more complicated issues. \n\n\"I understand. I'm not at home, give me ten minutes to drop things off and grab my shirt, another ten to get there. Twenty minutes, tops.\" Engage SuperSkwrl Mode.\n\n\"Thank God. Please hurry. I haven't been able to get ahold of anyone else, and I'm a good two hours away and have my daughter today...\"\n\n\"On my way.\" \\*click\\* There follows a considerable amount of *hustle* on my part. You see, your humble narrator doesn't own a car, and was riding his bicycle across town. I shift up a couple of gears and in the patois of my generation, book it home.\n\nGroceries are tossed into the fridge. Shirt is grabbed. Go go *go*..! I make the trip from my house to the hotel in five minutes, an unheard-of speed that may have included a couple of blown stoplights and my gasping for breath by the time I arrive.\n\nI don't know what to expect when I get there. I don't have any idea how bad it is. Will there be an ambulance? Will Rebbeca be laying in a pool of blood? *Am I going to have to hear my coworker's tearful final words*?? THIS IS NOT OKAY. I catapult myself into the lobby, bracing myself for the worst.\n\n\"Oh, you're here. Thanks for coming in. Bye.\"\n\nRebecca is... fine? She's certainly not showing any signs of stress or pain or anything as she clocks out and walks out the door. This is most certainly *not* the 'medical emergency' I was expecting. I am more than a little annoyed - had my manager exaggerated the situation to get me to come in? I call him.\n\n\"Hey Skwrl, how is she, is everything okay? What's going on?\" Okay, so not his fault.\n\n\"Yeah, about that. She's fine. At least she looks like she was. Left here under her own power.\"\n\n\"*What*?? I told her that if it was that bad, she needed to go to a hospital and... arrrgh...  Can you cover her shift?\" \n\n\"Ugh... yeah.. I suppose I can.\" At this point, I'm seething. As near as we can tell, my coworker has just decided to bail on us. Not okay.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the accordionist. We're getting there.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon proceeds normally. Lots more check-ins than I'm used to doing on the night shift, but I'm able to scarf down my dinner between guests. Chewing the last of my now-cold chow mein, I get a text from a friend, asking me if I'm going to the concert tonight?\n\nConcert? *What* concert? At the Performing Arts Center? Who's playing that my friend would know I would be interest- \n\n**OH.**\n\nGentle readers, there is one musician for whom I hold the deepest respect and adoration. Whose works I have followed since his earliest days. I could sing the entirety of his catalog back in high school. HE is the one playing tonight. The accordion player. Yes, *that* one.\n\nHe was on tour. Not just any tour, this was to be a *special* tour. Not the usual songs for which he is known, but highlighting his own *original* works. No big-concert flash and bang, just him out playing his songs for happy fans. I'd actually looked into getting tickets for the show in San Francisco, but it would have been logistically impossible, since I don't have a car. I'd resigned myself to missing out.\n\nIt turned out that with all the venues selling out, he'd added a couple more dates and locations.\n\nIncluding the Performing Arts Center one mile away from where I was standing. Tonight.\n\nI cannot adequately describe the sound my heart made at that point.\n\nThere were still seats available. I checked. I *could* have gone. I *should* have gone. This was a *once in a lifetime* event. Instead, I was covering for... Deep breaths. That way lies anger. So much anger . . .  Okay, nope, I tried. Looks like I'm gonna be pissed off about this. My long-time readers may recall the time 'Eric' [ruined Christmas](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/dhnv2y\/in_which_christmas_is_ruined\/). Yeah, same amount of anger.\n\nThankfully, the evening passes uneventfully, because I was NOT in the mood to deal with any problems or grumpy Karens, Emotional Support Unicorn or not. My shift ended about an hour after the concert. By the time I got home I was exhausted - being that angry takes work. So I just went to bed and passed out for sixteen hours.\n\nTo follow up, my manager stonewalled a bit when asked what happened. \"Not able to discuss it.\" with a tone of *deep* disappointment and anger. He was able to to tell me that he had pulled his daughter *out of a birthday party* in order to be able to deal with this mess. Thankfully his getting ahold of me meant that things weren't completely ruined and she was back in time for cake. Becca was off the schedule entirely, during a time when we were already very short-handed. A while later she was officially let go. I never received an apology from her.\n\nSo there we have it, a Tale of panic and deception, of a missed adventure, and stolen joy. I'm afraid it's not a happy Tale, so take some extra time with Buttercup if you need to.\n\nTeal Deer; coworker claims a 'medical emergency' to bail on her shift, I miss out on a once in a lifetime concert to cover.\n\nETA: link to Eric's story.\n\nEdit 2: Oh FFS...

When I clocked in for my shift there were 10 arrivals left, not bad at all. Usually when there\u2019s  more then 5 or so left, they end up coming around the same time to check in. I checked in all of the guests, with the exception of one no-show.\n\nThere was a group of guys that came to check in for two reservations. I checked both reservations in and they went to their rooms. About 10-15 minutes later they came back down to check out the suite shop area. One of the guys came up to me and claimed I was discriminating against him, because I gave some of the other guest\u2019s bags (it\u2019s literally a bottled water, a bag of chips, and peanuts.) I advised to him as a black man myself, that I was not discriminating against him, and that his claim was extremely ridiculous.

The fact of the matter is, there haven't been any stories to tell. My hotel has been rather strikingly bereft of any sort of anecdotes, humorous or otherwise. I mean, there was that one thing, but that's boring. And the other thing with the accordian player, but that's a bit personal. In any case, the overall vibe around here has been rather dull.\n\nNot that I'm complaining! I know better than to poke Murphy in the eye like that. Believe me, after the past couple of years, a year or so of dullness is actually rather welcome, even if Buttercup the Emotional Support Unicorn is looking bored. Go say hi to her, she could use the attention. Anyone needing some sparkles in their lives get priority.\n\nWIth that said, we did have an incident regarding a guest. Following behind the story of 'Janet' that someone else posted recently, our Tale tonight also involves a woman and her dogs.\n\nWe shall call her Kathryne. Kathryne Smellbutt. I'm not feeling kind.\n\nSome weeks ago, Kathryne checked into our lovely little hotel. Her address on file is in a nearby town, less than fifteen minutes away. Yes, Kath is a 'local', with all that implies. *Somehow* she managed to check in for her three-day stay with a crappy pre-paid gift card which we're not supposed to be *able* to take, not even for incidentals. And oh such incidentals there were to be.\n\nWhat Kath hadn't told us was that she was bringing her dogs. Two untrained huskies. *Very* untrained. Not housebroken. Both beds and the carpets and most of the towels were completely befouled. We suspected she was turning tricks in there, which makes me really wonder about the quality of her clients if they don't mind that much filth. Also if you've never been around huskies, they have an awful tendency to sound like someone is sawing their legs off with a rusty hacksaw when excited. Or bored. So we had dogs screaming loudly at random intervals.\n\nIn addition, she had some other charming traits, like visiting the breakfast bar three times a morning to sneak piles of food back to her room. She also smoked in the room, and would get very angry and verbal at staff.\n\nSo it came to little surprise that when she asked to extend her stay, we pointedly declined. When she checked out - late because she was planning on extending - the crappy gift card declined for the additional charges placed upon it, and she was added to the Do Not Rent list. A regrettable and expensive lesson as to why policies need to be adhered to, but it's over and we're done with her.\n\nOh wait, no we're not.\n\nIt seems that Mrs Smellbutt had gone ahead and made a new reservation for the next three nights before the DNR had processed. Okay, fine, canceled, dealt with. This apparently resulted in a screaming tirade when she tried to check back in a few hours later. She stomped off, never to be seen again.\n\nOh wait, there she is.\n\nShe had apparently just had an older gentleman make a reservation, and was staying with him, smugly informing us that there wasn't anything we could do because it wasn't *her* room, she was just visiting.\n\nWe informed her that this was not the case, that she was banned from the property in any and all contexts, as was her friend. And with that we bid her and her friend farewell.\n\nOh wait...\n \nShe decided to continue making reservations at our hotel, determined to *make* us let her stay with us, no matter what. The automated system would deny her of course, but she didn't let that stop her! She made over a *dozen* reservations over the next couple of weeks, using variations and misspellings of her name. Kathy Smellbutt. Cathryne Smellbutt. Kathrine Smellbutt. Katerine Smelbut. Smellbutt Kathryne. Each of them canceled as soon as they popped up on our Arrivals list. Then she tried the same thing with the third-party sites, only to run into the problem that as soon as we told them we didn't want her, her email address was blocked.\n\nWe never really figured out why she was so determined to stay with our hotel. Why make so many reservations, when we're just going to turn her away? Maybe because we're the only one nearby that accepts pets, but then she snuck them in anyways and didn't follow the pets policy. My guess was just sheer stubborn obsession. After about two weeks, she finally got the hint and stopped. \n\nIn any case, take some time to say good night to Buttercup, and hope that you're untroubled by persistant locals with untrained dogs.\n\nTeal Deer; persistant local won't take 'go away' for an answer.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676543409.0},{"title":"Pursers desk on a cruise","author":"AuntieFifi61","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/113cd8a\/pursers_desk_on_a_cruise\/","text":"The Pursers desk on a cruise ship is the front desk of a hotel.

It was about half and half between people here for Mardi Gras balls or here for work. I do the customer service thing with making food recommendations, giving people numbers for transportation in case they're too tired\/drunk to walk back, all that good stuff. The majority were satisfied and I hope *theyyyy* enjoy their stay.\n\nThese other two dingbats... I hope they always manage to somehow step on a Lego. From bad to worse, here's what happened tonight:\n\nThis man comes flying into the hotel only to be met with a locked door. Instead of reading the 4 carefully crafted colorful signs I have on the doors explaining both how to get in and where to park, *he starts banging on the door*. I can hear this from my back office (and yes, I can see it on my camera too. No I'm not getting up, and I'm not sorry). I assume the worst and decide it's best to keep whatever danger he's running from outside of the hotel for the safety of my guests indoors.\n\nIt finally dawns on him to ring the doorbell... multiple times in succession... \ud83d\ude12 At this point, he's truly been out there long enough to read all the signs twice. So he shouldn't have any stupid questions by the time I get to the door to let him in.\n\nHe immediately asks about parking, for which there are 2 signs on the doors, and one at the desk. My tongue was probably bleeding from biting it so hard, so I simply pointed at the sign on the desk. His response:\n\n*\"You speak English?\"*\n\n# (MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU READ IT?!?!?!)\n\nMy actual response: \"Not really, no.\"\n\nI got to the end of his check-in in silence.

I am taken aback. I see that she's a digital check-in, so all I need is her ID. Her husband is nearby on the phone, and heard me say \"ID\", so he offers his own.\n\n\"*SHE DON'T NEED YOUR ID! IT'S UNDER MY NAME!\"* \n\nI am taken further aback, but I say, \"Sure, sir, I'll take your ID and add your name to the reservation!\" As I am doing this, she says that she should be on the 4th floor. I look and see that she is indeed NOT on the 4th floor. Her reservation has no notes about any room requests. In fact, her reservation indicated that she reserved whatever we had left, so that's what morning shift gave her--a room on the 3rd floor. We are sold out, so I couldn't make any changes. \n\nI do my best to explain to her that requests are not guarantees--we have a lot of extended stay guests in the hotel and they occupy a lot of the high demand rooms.\n\n*\"Well I spoke to \\[a person who is not an employee at the hotel\\] and she said it WAS available!\"*\n\n\"...ma'am we don't have anyone by that name who works here, so she can't guarantee anything.\"\n\n*\"I MADE THIS RESERVATION A MONTH AGO!

I tell him that she didn't get the floor she requested. He looks at her and says the same thing I already told her (I love that guy). She eventually retreats to her room.\n\nI was ~~pleased~~ to get a call from her a short time later wondering why she was in a 2 queen room instead of the King suite she asked for. I repeated the conversation at the front desk.\n\n*\"It seems like I'm just wasting my time, huh? How am I supposed to get the things I ask for?!\"* \n\nShe came back down with her husband a short while later dressed for a Mardi Gras event. They tried to leave through the side of the hotel we have locked (signs posted). Instead of reading the sign and attributing it to why the door didn't automatically open, she decided to push her way through. The noise of it all brings me out of my back office, just to see her pretending to read the sign. I say nothing. \n\n*\"Everything I try to do gets messed up! Now I gotta go aaaalllll the way around!\"*\n\nIn my head, I'm thinking \ud83c\udfb6It's you... hi... you're the problem, it's you!\ud83c\udfb6\n\nI'm sending good vibes to my coworkers who have to deal with her later.

I believe they stayed Friday, Saturday, and Sunday- leaving on Monday morning. We didn\u2019t really have any problems with them during the stay, and they didn\u2019t stick out in any particular way.\n\nA couple days after they had checked out, I received a phone call from the man. And apparently he was on speakerphone, because it was easy to hear the interjections his wife was periodically making. Here\u2019s how the conversation went:\n\n**Man:** Hello, I just wanted to ask about a rate discrepancy I noticed when I checked the transaction history on my credit card. It looks like we paid $85 the first night, and $120 for the next night, followed by the third night which cost $92*\n\n*\\*(Note: can\u2019t remember the exact numbers since this happened awhile ago, but the exact numbers aren\u2019t really important.)*\n\n**Me:** Alrighty, I\u2019ve pulled up the folio from your last stay, and I can see you were charged the $85, $120, and $92 for each night, respectively. Is that what you\u2019re asking about? \n\n**Man:** Yes, that\u2019s it. I was wondering why they\u2019re all different instead of having the same price each night. \n\n**Me:** Okay, I understand what you\u2019re asking now. Our rates change from night to night based on availability, day of the week, and the rates of other hotels in the area.\n\n**His Wife:** That\u2019s fucking bullshit\n\n**Man:** Is it something you change manually each day?\n\n**Me:** No, sir. It\u2019s generally calculated by our system based on the aspects I mentioned earlier. Future dates already have a predetermined rate in the system. That rate might change as we get closer to the week in question, but never does it change on a reservation that\u2019s already been made. \n\n**Wife:** What the fuck is she talking about? She\u2019s lying! *\\**(speaking to me directly)*\\** This is ridiculous. They told me what the price was on Friday, and it should be that same price for Saturday and Sunday. \n\n**Me:** Ma\u2019am, the registration form you signed upon arrival did list the rate for each night you planned to stay, and you would\u2019ve been offered a receipt during checkout.\n\n**Wife:** No, nobody told me that. Nobody changes prices like that. You need to tell people that each night isn\u2019t the same rate before you fuck them over like this.\n\n**Me:** Ma\u2019am, it\u2019s pretty standard for hotels to change their rates from night to night based on availability.\n\n**Wife:** Well it\u2019s not standard for ME. You didn\u2019t tell me that each night was a different rate. You need to tell people that! This is FRAUD, and you should have your business fucking shut down for fraudulent charges and deliberate deception-\n\n**Me, Interrupting her:** Ma\u2019am, I\u2019m very sorry that you were taken by surprise over this, but this is pretty standard for all hotels, and the price for each night was clearly listed on your registration form. \n\n**Wife:** This is fucking ridiculous. You should be sued over this. \n\n**Man:** I understand, I know it\u2019s not your fault and I appreciate your help. Is there anything you can do?\n\n**Me:** Unfortunately no, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s just the way our rates work. \n\n**Wife:** *\\*Scoffs in the background*\\*\n\n**Man:** Okay, I understand. Thank you for your help.

I offered to get their stuff out there on booking platforms, help with their websites, accommodation systems, or anything really. I just wanted a cool place to stay for some work trade.\n\nI got a few offers, but one came from this brand new luxury resort on the far side of the island in this little seaside town. They said they needed help getting reservations, so off I went. I'd actually ridden across Europe from England on my bicycle and was now just trying to make the last of my money stretch until airfares got cheaper in September (this was July, last summer). Free accommodations would do the trick.\n\nI was picked up by the one of three owners of the luxury resort. One owner was a Greek guy that thought he was some magical healer that could read auras (The Mystic), there was his American wife, and a Greek chef that made Greek-French fusion food that was absolutely incredible. My ride was with the Mystic.\n\nI threw my bike in the trunk of his car and we climbed the mountain range over to the far side of the island and pulled into the resort. It was small (14 rooms), but very, very nice. There was a heated pool, a restaurant, and a terraced view of the entire coastline below us. Stunning really. They had two Polish girls for waitresses and not a single guest, in mid July, on an island that was basically sold out in every other resort.\n\nI asked how they were advertising...\n\nMystic's wife: \"We have a website my husband's brother made us.\"\n\nMe: \"Hmm. but how are you advertising the website? Do you have Blooking.crom? Exploitia? Air Blee n Blee?\"\n\nMystic's wife: \"We have none of those. I don't know how to use them.\"\n\nMe: \"Do you have any reservations coming in at all?\"\n\nMystic's Wife: \"None. We've been open for two weeks. We really need your help.\"\n\nMe: \"Alright then. Let me get to work.\"\n\nIn the next 48 hours, I had them up and running on the big three online booking platforms. By the second day, our first reservation came in. It was 10k Euro for two rooms for the month. Mystic's wife cried when it came in. By day 4 I had over 60k Euro worth of bookings. This was the only resort with rooms left in the area and it filled quick.\n\nI then went on to make them a MUCH better website (easy website builder), and set up an accommodations system and a channel manager for them. Then I taught them how to check guests in and meet their needs while they were there. I basically ran the place for about a month.\n\nThe chef was especially grateful. He gave me a MASSIVE glass container full of homemade wine and fed me delicious food every day. The Mystic was a little stand-offish, but he warmed up after awhile. The Mystic's wife devolved into a bit of binge drinking while I was running the place and rarely came to work for awhile, but she got it together in the end, when I said I was leaving and really needed to show her how to manage what I had going on there. She finally went sober the last week and paid attention and figured it out.\n\nThe place finished the season well. I've checked the reviews and they are doing fine.

It's our corporate number. I pick it up (obviously) and the following conversation ensues\n\nRep: \"Hi this is a representative from the \\*company name\\* Diamond Elite special line. I have a guest who is staying in your hotel and he is asking why he is not being allowed to sit at the bar area?\"\n\nMe: We got rid of our barstools due to covid and just have not put them back up.\" \n\nRep: Oh well the guest says that covid is over.\n\nMe: Well it most definitely is not, I myself just had covid a couple of weeks ago. We still have guests check out early due to having covid.\n\nRep: Okay thank you, I will try to explain it to the guest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA minute or so later the guest comes up to the desk and tells me\"Sorry about that, Just had to get it on record so the manager was aware.\" I told him he is. \"Oh okay, maybe that will light a fire under him haha.\" One of my other social girls then comes up to me and tells me he's bothering other guests about it and asking them if they miss the stools, to which all of them said no. He's then bragging to them about reporting us to corporate.\n\nIs it just me or is he literally just doing it for fun? Like what does it bother you so much for dude? No one else has ever complained about them before and frankly, I don't think anyone will. I think it's so stupid because he's never been to our location before either. And why would he feel the need to drag others into it?

I\u2019ll affectionately call him Asshole. \n\nAsshole booked two rooms with us on an employee rate\u2014one for that day and one for the next day. He came to check into his room with me, and most of the time was spent going back and forth about his rate\u2014incidentals, parking, etc. \n\nOnce we finally got everything figured out (as in **HE CONFIRMED THAT THE RATE HE BOOKED WITH WAS THE RATE HE WAS PAYING NOW\u2014A FIXED EMPLOYEE RATE**), I checked him in and gave him his keys. Asshole stuck around for some reason while I checked in another guest, who I was able to properly give my welcome spiel. Apparently the new guest got more info than Asshole did (maybe because he didn\u2019t waste time arguing about his rate). Asshole was upset and wanted to speak to a manager. I gave him my new GM\u2019s card. \n\nA short time later, he said that the other room he had reserved was for his cousin, who would be arriving at 3am. He said he spoke with \u201csomeone\u201d who said it was okay for her to check in at that time. The problem was, we were sold out. Her reservation was for the next day. She would have been fine checking in at check-in time. But we\u2019re not really in the business of kicking out paying customers just because your cousin wants to arrive at 3am on a sold out night. So of course, Asshole was upset because he felt like he was lied to. I don\u2019t really know how that conversation went when his cousin arrived. I was long gone. \n\n*(This next part is on the hotel, in the way that if one of us makes a painfully odd and bad decision, then it reflects on all of us. At the time of this incident, we had rehired a NA who had previously been with the hotel for 10 years. I will affectionately call her Can\u2019t Get Right. What she did, I still can\u2019t explain\u2026)*\n\nI got to work the next morning and I made the housekeeping boards. On the board to check out that day was Asshole\u2019s cousin. I thought nothing of it until the housekeepers came huffing at me at 11:15 asking why she hadn\u2019t left yet. So I go to the room to see what was up. \n\nCousin answers the door and tells us that she\u2019s not due to check out for another 3 days. Ummm\u2026 no, we have you out TODAY. So everyone was confused. Cousin chose to make a call to Asshole while I went back up front to figure out if we did something wrong. \n\nI went back to my computer to do research when I got a call from Asshole, who wasn\u2019t on property at the time (thank goodness). He\u2019s yelling and screaming about how we messed up and we need to fix this and *\u201cYOU NEED TO GET ON YOUR LITTLE COMPUTER RIGHT NOW AND TELL ME WHAT YOU DID WRONG!\u201d* I was trying to get him to calm down long enough for me to tell him I was trying to figure it out. But he kept screaming, so I hung up on him. Not sorry. \n\nThe mistake that was made \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u2026 when Cousin came to check in with Can\u2019t Get Right, her card kept declining. So in order to get the card to go through, Can\u2019t Get Right chipped away at her length of stay until she got an approval. *She whittled it down from 4 days to one day, and didn\u2019t tell anyone*. I will literally never know why she thought that was a good idea. \n\nOnce I figured that out, I told Cousin to meet me at the desk so I could fix everything. She gave me a card that worked, and she was honestly a sweetheart about all of it. We had a lovely conversation about her being a nurse through COVID and I wished her luck on the rest of her career. She went back to her room and no one bothered her for the rest of her stay. For the inconvenience, the GM gave her one night free. \n\nThen came the day for Asshole to check out. I had been bracing myself for his departure because there was no time I talked to him that he wasn\u2019t an absolute prick. But he came down from his room, I handed him his folio, and he jetted out the door. I let out a sigh of relief. \n\n\u2026until he sprinted back in claiming there was a problem with his bill \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\n\nHe claims we overcharged him $10 a day for his stay. This was simply not possible because he was on a fixed employee rate\u2014the same rate HE quoted ME when he checked in. My GM had stepped in, and Asshole was waving a screenshot at us attempting to prove us wrong. He was such a monster that GM gave him the discount just to get him to leave. \n\nBUT, so y\u2019all don\u2019t think my GM is a punk\u2026 he told me to figure out where Asshole works. He planned to call Asshole\u2019s GM to tell them how much of a bully he was. Yep, just throw the drama in his court and let his GM decide if he can keep his employee benefits \ud83d\ude0c","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676402337.0},{"title":"Are taxis this bad everywhere?","author":"mstarrbrannigan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/112mhtf\/are_taxis_this_bad_everywhere\/","text":"Dealing with traditional taxis companies is such a pain in the ass. I'm trying to get this delusional old homeless woman out of the lobby of my hotel and she needs me to call a taxi for her. Okay, I call the number of the cab company she wants to use. They say *maybe* they can have a car out here in 35 to 45 minutes. I can't have this lady here that much longer. She's bothering me, she's bothering the guests, it's just not going to happen. She's been in and out for the last three hours and I've reached my breaking point.\n\nIt's nice outside, so I instruct her on where to go and wait there for the cab that's off the property. She relays this to the taxi company, and they say they'll call back in ten minutes and let us know when they'll have a car out. The lady starts moving her mountain of stuff and I breathe a sigh of relief. Ten minutes later the taxis company calls back and suddenly the dispatcher is like yeah I don't know when we'll be able to have a car out there, we don't have any cars in the area.\n\nWhich is ridiculous. One of the hotel's main selling points is how conveniently located it is to EVERYTHING. We're fifteen minutes from the airport, we're less than that to downtown. Five minutes in either direction and you're right at huge shopping centers We're right on one of the main veins of this part of town. And you've got no cars in the area?\n\nThe taxi company just called back while I was writing this to say they're not coming. Absolutely useless, no wonder they are losing the transportation fight against Uber.\n\nEdit: I just got back from telling her the cab isn't coming and she asked me to call the police to give her a ride. I told her no, and she asked if she could come back to the property. I told her no. She asked if I was going to call the police if she came back, and I said no but I would throw her bags in the dumpster if she came back. I really don't want to do that because it's so shitty, and probably won't but I don't want to call the police either. They're going to take forever to show up too, if they even bother, and I'll have to deal with her the whole time.\n\nEdit 2: She got her wish.

Buckle up folks. \n\nTo start this off, I\u2019ll tell you that my hotel has three floors. The first, which consists of pet-friendly rooms only. The second, in which we occasionally put pets in 201-205 if the first floor is full, but otherwise there\u2019s no pets allowed. And the third, which is completely pet free. It\u2019s our \u201chypoallergenic floor.\u201d Guests without pets who may be allergic or sensitive to animals can be assured that the third floor does not house any pets whatsoever. \n\nOkay, this guest, let\u2019s call her Janet. Janet checks in at 4am. The night auditor said she wanted a price match for an online rate. Online rate was for the incorrect day, so we couldn\u2019t honor it. Janet kept fighting. NA called the manager and asked, and the manager said \u201cyeah whatever, $92.22 is fine, don\u2019t waste time arguing with this lady over $10.\u201d \n\nJanet gets checked in, and since she denies having a pet, she\u2019s put on the third floor. Her initial reservation was for two nights. She did not leave her room for two entire days. Somehow, Janet snuck a little dog up into her room after being checked in. And like I said, she did not leave her room for two entire days.\n\nAfter two days, Janet came down to ask for an extension. Since the initial reservation was through a prepaid NF third party, we had to make her a new reservation. And while making her a new reservation, Janet let slip that she had a dog. Whoops. It was explained to her that she had to move down to the first floor. She was immediately upset and annoyed by this, and demanded to know why she couldn\u2019t just stay where she was. And it was explained, once again, that dogs were not allowed on the third floor. After some more whining, she was told that she\u2019d move to the first floor or move to another hotel. She chose the first floor. \n\nShe\u2019d refused housekeeping while she was in the third floor room. That\u2019s not uncommon, but the report I got from the housekeepers was, well, it was\u2026 something. Like I said, Janet did not leave the room for two days, so Janet\u2019s dog did not leave the room for two days either. Where in that room did the dog relieve itself? Take a guess. Go ahead. She let the dog piss and shit in the bed. That\u2019s right, folks! Fido hopped up on the bed and shit in the sheets. \n\nAnd not only did Janet allow the dog to do that- she also fed the dog while in her bed. Cut up pieces of hotdog, to be exact. And Janet ate her own food in bed too. (And just as a bonus, she also set the supervisory fire alarm off one night. She frantically called the front desk and apologized- explaining that she\u2019d lit a candle and didn\u2019t realize it would set off the alarm. Uh huh. I\u2019m not entirely convinced it *was* a candle. But okay.)\n\nSo housekeeping went into the room to find the sheets completely covered in dog piss and shit, cut up bits of hotdogs, and various other food crumbs and stains. The bathroom towels? Also covered in smeared dog piss, shit, and food stains. Every flat surface in the room was dirty and very sticky. The housekeeper assigned to laundry that day said she could smell those sheets before they were even the whole way down the laundry chute. \n\nA pet fee was added to this woman\u2019s room, and she had to sign a pet policy (which detailed our fee at the top of the page), and she signed without a word. \n\nThe sheets, to everyone\u2019s surprise, came out of the wash completely clean, although the towels did not. They were unsalvageable and had to be discarded. Management decided it was appropriate to charge this lady the $20 needed for us to replace the towels. Sounds reasonable to me. \n\nJanet stays in her first floor room for the night and then wants to make a new reservation for an additional two nights. She won\u2019t extend her stay. She wants a whole new reservation for reasons unknown to me. There\u2019s no benefit to creating a new reservation rather than extending the current one, but she demanded it, so whatever. You learn to pick your battles in this field. \n\nSo she stays the extra night then packs her stuff and heads out. Housekeeping found that the room was in a similar state to the one on the third floor. Unsurprisingly. \n\nAnd if you think that the drama ends after checkout, boy are you in for a shock.\n\nJanet calls the hotel the next day and demands to know why she was charged $25 plus tax for the pet fee. Um, possibly because you had a pet with you, Janet. Had you considered that? Janet was angry and said that her dog was a service dog and not a pet. She said she wanted the fee dropped because we aren\u2019t allowed to charge for a service dog. And y\u2019all, it\u2019s sadly so very easy for people to game the system since we can only ask people with service dogs two questions: do you have this animal due to a disability? and what tasks has this animal been trained to perform? Nothing else. And she knew that and gamed the system. She really claimed that her small dog, who pissed and shit in the bed repeatedly, was a service dog. Much convincing, very intelligence. \n\nAnd since we can\u2019t ask any additional questions, we ultimately had to drop the pet fee. \n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! The next evening, Janet drives herself back to the hotel, busts through the doors like the kool-aid man, and throws two damp and discolored towels up on the front desk counter. Janet said she was upset that she was charged $20 just because \u201cthe towels accidentally got mixed up in her laundry.\u201d \n\nAnd then she immediately launched into saying that the pet fee hadn\u2019t been dropped and it needed to be dropped immediately because it was a SERVICE. DOG. I explained that the fee was reversed, but would take some time to be reflected in her account. She hops on her mobile banking app, pulls up a charge, and then turns her phone to show me and says, \u201cthere, do you see it?\u201d The charge was for a transaction at the local Subway. I said, \u201cer\u2026 no?\u201d And she looked, said whoops, and pulled up a charge and again turned her phone and asked if I saw it. And it was still the same Subway transaction. No ma\u2019am, I *don\u2019t* see it. Third time\u2019s the charm, and she finally pulled up the pet fee. Which literally just said \u201cPet Fee- $26.50.\u201d I again explained to her that  it was indeed reversed, but it would take time for it to show up in her account. \n\nAnd then she launched straight into saying that the price of her room was incorrect for the first night. She was charged $92.22, but the \u201cwoman at the front desk had agreed to $80 because she (Janet) was only here for seven hours that first night!\u201d Lady. Seven hours is a night. It\u2019s the whole night. Some people stay shorter times than that and pay for a whole night. Like cmon now smh.\n\nAnd then she kept saying there were things wrong with the other charges on her card. Keep in mind that she has three different folios on three different reservations, so I was jumping back and forth between all three trying to follow along. At one point, I tried to explain what an authorization hold was, and she freaked out thinking that we\u2019d frozen her bank account. I honestly facepalmed when she said that. I couldn\u2019t help it. She just wouldn\u2019t stop rambling. \n\nFinally I decided that I couldn\u2019t help her myself with everything she wanted help with, so I interrupted her and said, \u201cma\u2019am I don\u2019t think I personally will be able to help you with this. Adjustments to charges beyond glaring mistakes have to be taken up with management.\u201d She says, \u201coh I know, I just want to make sure you know exactly what my problem is.\u201d\n\nProblem? Singular? Lady you have multiple problems. Multiple fabricated problems. As if I didn\u2019t know she was retroactively lying about everything. We ain\u2019t stupid. \n\nAnd she went straight back to rambling about the charges, and I tried to ask if the phone number listed on her reservation was the best way to contact her. \n\nShe kept rambling over me. So I just kept saying, \u201cma\u2019am. Ma\u2019am. Ma\u2019am. Ma\u2019am.\u201d Until she stopped and said, \u201cyes that phone number is fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAwesome, I\u2019ll have my manager call you with more information. Hope you have a good day!\u201d (Hint hint please leave)\n\nAnd she huffed and said, \u201cwell, okay. But I am mad about being charged $20 for those towels. They just got mixed in with my own laundry accidentally. I\u2019d like that charge to be dropped.\u201d And she gestured to the damp and discolored towels up on the counter. I said I\u2019d pass it along to the manager.\n\nAnyway, the punchline is that those weren\u2019t even the towels we charged her for. We charged her $20 for the towels she ruined on the third floor. We hadn\u2019t even realized that she stole towels from the room on the first floor. She brought in the stolen towels we hadn\u2019t even realized she stole. And she asked for the charges to be dropped.\n\nAnd those ones were also unsalvageable, so guess who got charged another $20 for the additional towels. Thanks for letting us know, Janet. We\u2019ll adjust your charges accordingly!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676391021.0},{"title":"Being followed to my car really took the fun out of my job.","author":"Imaginary_Quit_2283","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/111wt77\/being_followed_to_my_car_really_took_the_fun_out\/","text":"I work for a hotel that mostly houses construction workers and truckers.

She wanted this fee waived. My GM said to accommodate this, we either waive her parking fee or take $40 off at the end of her stay. \n\nI was the one lucky enough to check her and her husband in. I had already been briefed about her situation. Because I had to give out wristbands to all our guests for security reasons, I wanted to verify how many people would be staying in the room. She said 3. Three people in a 4 person max room. I became confused at what the \u201cextra person fee\u201d was about*, but since she already talked to my GM about it, I didn\u2019t fuss. I waived her parking fee. \n\nThis was all fine and dandy until the husband produced a small dog with an Emotional Support vest on.

I occasionally think of this story when I ask for an ID.\n\nIt was a really beautiful hotel and conference center. It was a refurbished factory mill in a small New England town with a settlers landmark. So we got business people attending conferences their companies book for an eclectic space and wedding blocks for scenic weddings. It was only the odd guest who came for a different reason.\n\nIt was around noon, totally empty and way before check in time without many check ins at all. I was training with the FDM just the two of us. In walks a man who\u2019s practically my P\u00e9p\u00e9: French Canadian, about 70yo, wearing a trucker hat and reeking of alcohol at noon on a weekday.\n\nHe comes up to the desk and wants a walk in reservation. We had availability so my manager told him we could do it. But this guy was probably my P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s twin, so I knew he was going to be a problem even as she said that.\n\nMy FDM asks for a credit card and ID. He wants to pay \u201cup front\u201d with cash. Again, he\u2019s clearly functioning drunk from the smell and there\u2019s the question of why he wants a walk in reservation at noon on a random weekday. My FDM is firm and tells him that we charge upon check out, need a credit card on file and require an incidental hold. He still wants to pay up front with cash and is now arguing about the incidentals. It goes back and forth until FDM shows him the reg card he\u2019ll have to sign that explains exactly what she\u2019s been telling him. He seems to finally accept that we need a card and gives us his debit from the local bank. FDM asks for an ID to go with the card. He gives her a handwritten prison ID. Kudos to her for continuing to keep a straight face, I was still pretending to be busy doing paperwork. She tells him that it needs to be a photo ID, like a drivers license, state ID or passport. Guy gets upset because this is his only ID. He doesn\u2019t have a drivers license and apparently hasn\u2019t had a need to get a state ID or passport. (Btw, we saw him drive up alone in a car, so now I could probably trade him in for my P\u00e9p\u00e9 with no difference.)\n\nMy FDM smoothly and quietly asks me to get the GM while pretending to study the guy\u2019s prison ID. The GM comes out and explains to this man that we need a credit card, a photo ID with the cardholder\u2019s name and the person on the ID. The guy starts accusing us of discriminating against him for previously being in prison. The GM says that\u2019s not the issue, it\u2019s that a handwritten note is not the same as a photo ID. The guy wants to speak to GM\u2019s boss. GM tells him that he\u2019s the GM of the hotel and that there\u2019s no corporate. P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s twin throws a few curses at us and storms back out to his car.\n\nThe three of us are watching him drive away and my FDM asks if we should call the cops because he\u2019s clearly DUI and apparently doesn\u2019t have a license. Again, small town, so I, 100% familiar with how this works, just say, \u201cYou can give whoever\u2019s patrolling a heads up. I can guarantee you they recognize him.\u201d So GM called the police sergeant.\n\nTL;DR: Local drunks are fun.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676314899.0},{"title":"Seriously this early\u2026(rant)","author":"oliviagonz10","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/1114ka7\/seriously_this_earlyrant\/","text":"Okay sorry for bad formatting I\u2019m on mobile but this just happened at 4:30am.\n\nI\u2019m in the back making coffee when I walk out and notice a couple sitting waiting for me.

He says what it is and told me that he stayed here at the same time for the same event and it was only like $250 total. 1.) That was a rate two years ago. Rates can change yearly. 2.) Two years ago was still during the pandemic, so prices for a lot of hotels was lower to try to get business, or we didn't increase the price since the event wasn't as big as it usually was due to Covid. And 3.) Prices are made based off what the surrounding hotels offer too. There are six hotels that are next to us and dozens more down the road since we are by a major university.\n\nI explained that rates can and do change every year, and those are the rates that I can offer.

(Vent)","author":"FarbatosXD","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/11033gz\/whys_your_manager_not_here_at_243_am_vent\/","text":"I've been waiting to be able to tell my first tale from my workplace, but now that I am, boy, do I wish I weren't.  \n\n\nContext: The hotel I work at is a 4 star property located in Central Europe. The hotel is owned by a German chain and is the only hotel from this chain in the country. It is right next to one of the three major railway stations of the country's capital - as such, most of our guests are leisure groups, airline crews, people on business trips and occasionally the participants of the events held in our conference rooms. I work as an FDA, the other heroes of this tale are FDA1, FDA2, FDS (supervisor), FOM and RDM (Front Office and Rooms Division Managers) and SEC (Security). During the day shift, usually both managers are in, during the night shift only one FDA and SEC - two people in total.  \n\n\nI was just returning home from a short countryside trip thursday night, when I received a message in the Front Office group chat from FDA1, which loosely translated read as follows:  \n\"I request that during the day shift either of the managers please have a firm talk with the guests on a stag party \/ bachelor party about basic human behavior and rules present at a hotel. \"Just having fun\" is not an excuse, especially for (supposed) adults. See FO report. Thank you.\"\n\nI could already tell stuff was going to go down. Friday night comes, as does my shift. I come in at 7pm, situation is as follows:\n\nThe guys on the stag party are foreigners, they have 7 rooms with us, two people in each room, all booked through a 3rd party site. When checking in on thursday, FDA2 and FDS were on shift. By their account, they were already drunk at arrival, they were causing a scene, being loud and disruptive. FOM and RDM at this time were in the back office, directly behind the front desk, painfully within earshot of all this happening and lifted not a single finger to get the situation under control.  \nFDA2 and FDS, both women of smaller statures wanted them in their rooms ASAP, so they did not take credit card guarantees for all of the rooms because quite frankly they were scared of these 14 or so drunk, unpredictable and possibly agressive men of bigger statures - and I can't blame them one bit.\n\nThursday night the stag party guests, drunk off their behinds started belittling and berating both FDA1 and SEC for not serving them way outside the bar's opening hours. After that they started coming up with reasons they weren't able to order food for themselves and wanted FDA1 to do it for them, who obviously refused. In turn, they told her to go make sandwiches, then. Then they couldn't get the elevators working because they were too drunk to touch their keycards to the sensor inside - so FDA1 had to help them - all while enduring a barrage of 'come, tuck me in'-s and 'you could come with me, you know'-s.    \n\n\nDuring the friday day shift FOM and RDM managed to acquire some more credit card guarantees, but not for all of the rooms. These guys are out at night and sleeping during the day - and they also sleep in bulk, so only in 4 or 5 of the rooms of the 7 total, and they keep switching around between each other. How do we know? When Housekeeping went to do the daily cleaning in the rooms, they found them knocked out on each other - that's why noone answered the door, so Housekeeping thought it was empty. And in the 2 empty rooms they found urine and vomit on the bedding.\n\nEnter me and my shift on friday night. All goes relatively well until about 2:45am, when one of the stag party guys arrives at the hotel drunk, with a taxi driver on his tail. He comes up to the front desk and I ask how I may help him. He says that his card was authorized for much more than discussed and now he can't pay his taxi. I'm checking all the reservations for the group because at this point it's clear that it does not matter which room has his name. Lo and behold, his card is given for two rooms as guarantee, and there's an alert on the reservation that he voluntarily gave his card for two rooms. Counting for exchange rate, the authorized amount is correct - ca. 80 \u20ac \/ room. I tell him this and that if he has an issue with this, him and the others can discuss this with any of my managers.  \n\\-Ok, where is he? - he asks.  \n\\-He's not here at the moment, sir.  \n\\-Why, where is he?  \n\\-Not here. It is 2:45am, he is not working now.  \n\\-Call him. Give him a call to give me back my money.  \n\\-I'm sorry sir but this is not an emergency. I am not calling him.  \n\\-Then you give me back my money.  \n\\-I am absolutely not going to behind my manager's back about this. Even if I did, you may not get the money for 2-5 business days if I reverse the authorization in this very moment.  \nAt this point he started going off about how he's not able to pay the taxi driver; how if I have kids then God bless me, I should know how important a full fridge is; how this is utterly embarassing for him and pretty much everything else while berating my managers. After about 7-10 minutes of this, the taxi driver leaves without his payment and the guest goes to his room. Or at least one of the rooms.\n\nThen at about 5am five of the guys arrive in the lobby. #1 asks for pen and paper and starts scribbling something. About 20 minutes later he leaves for his room.   \n\\#2, supposedly the groom, from what we could make out is going on to me and SEC about how he's going to dropkick #1. After about 5 minutes of this, he finds himself a seat in one of our sofas and starts doozing off.  \n\\#3 and #4 ask me if I have a microwave they can use. I tell them that due to both health regulations and house rules I cannot let them use the one they figured we have in the kitchen. They start indirectly talking to \/ about me between themselves from next to #2.  \nAfter #1 leaves, #5 arrives on the scene, making his way from the guest bathrooms, which I did not even see him enter in the past 2.5 hours. First he stumbles into the kitchen, so I kindly ask him to turn around and make his way to his friends in the lobby.  \nSo now #2 is sleeping on a sofa, #3 and #4 are conversing and #5, seemingly clueless to where or who he is, just sits down next to them. #3 and #4 have a grocery bag with them that is going to be important later. #3 and #4 go out the main entrance to smoke a cigarette. #5 picks up their grocery bag and starts heading towards the elevators. He stops for a second then exits to the garage.\n\nAt this point, much as I'd love to babysit grown, drunk foreigners, I was way behind my NA work so I could not afford to point him in the direction of his room. About 3 minutes later I see #3, #4 and #5 enter through the main door without the grocery bag in hand. #4 and #5 sit down next to #2 and #3 comes to the front desk to ask me about the grocery bag. I tell him all I saw and that I don't know where the bag is now.\n\n5:40am rolls around and the three blokes gather their strength to raise #2 from the dead and get him up to his room and I'd thought that's all I would have of them for the remaining one hour of my shift. At about 6am the Housekeeper that just arrived brings me the bag #3 was looking for from the garage. 'Great, I think to myself, I can return this to #3 and he'll be happy, all's well that ends well.'  \nRight? Right? Yeah, right.  \n6:20am: #3 comes to the front desk to ask about the bag again and I gladly hand it to him. It is at this point he starts promptly screaming in my face about how I lied to him and how I took it afterall.   \n\n\nSo when are our managers kicking them out and not letting them harass employees any longer? - you might be asking yourself. Yeah, not happening. They're still in-house tonight and are departing tomorrow. I'm guessing that'll make for another story - one that I'm glad I won't be around to witness firsthand.  \n\n\nMay be making another post if anything Part 2 worthy happens tonight.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676163676.0},{"title":"Guests got upset because I couldn't recommend a \"quiet\" sports bar","author":"toadTHEBlTCHdette","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10zi9mq\/guests_got_upset_because_i_couldnt_recommend_a\/","text":"This couple can down in the evening and asked if I knew of any bars where they could get a glass of wine.

I've been working at a relatively small hotel for almost 2 years now, primarily on the 4 pm to midnight shift, and I actually like working swing. Don't have to wake up early, go to bed as late as I feel like. Yeah, I usually deal with more assholes on swing shift, but I can handle that.\n\nWhat I dislike more than anything on morning shifts is having to tell someone that we're confiscating their deposit or part of their deposit because they've fucked something up in their room. Granted, I don't like kicking people out either, but when people need to go, they've got to go.\n\nSo we take deposits for all locals and for people who  just generally look sketchy, since we've had rooms get trashed and lost money having to repair or replace things. I figure that's pretty standard for most places. Today, I had to confiscate three deposits for varying levels of damage. The first guy broke the glass plate in the microwave. Sorry, that's $40 because without it, the microwave is garbage. He wasn't too happy, but left without saying anything. Second guy ruins towels and items are missing from the room, so I have to take his whole $100 deposit. Naturally, I get cussed out, and he peels out of our parking lot and onto the main drag without stopping at the intersection. Whatever.\n\nThird guy comes up, and I have to take $25 out of his deposit because there is dog hair all over the room. I mean, it's going to take the housekeepers a lot of extra time to clean this room with all of the fur just everywhere. I apologize, and go to return the rest of his deposit, but he starts cussing me out and calling me a lying scumbag (among other things, of course). I'm furious now, and only barely manage to keep it together, but he goes to his van and I'm expecting the worst of it to be over. Asshole then comes back to yell at me more and demand to speak to my supervisor. I lose it and tell him to fuck off, and start calling the cops to get him to leave. We end up having a massive screaming match in the parking lot until I storm off back into the office. Dude's now on DNR and the rest of his deposit is confiscated. Call it the asshole tax. Fortunately, the owners have my back, and the altercation is all caught on camera.\n\nOf course, he calls Customer Care and makes a complaint against me, but at this point, I don't really give a shit. I know my job is safe, but I hate losing my temper the way I did with a guest. It sounds fucked up, but at least he paid a literal price for his actions. And to think, it was over 25 fucking dollars.\n\nGod, do I hate morning shift.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676150559.0},{"title":"Second week in a row I check someone into an occupied room due to 2nd shift","author":"Healthy-Library4521","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10yp9ly\/second_week_in_a_row_i_check_someone_into_an\/","text":"My 2nd shift person keeps messing up on basic things.

They come back to the desk and tell me the room is occupied.  I go to the room, find out they were originally checked into another room that was flooded. 2nd shift moves the guest into their current room without changing anything in the system or reg cards.  1st guest gets 30% off rate due to my guest walking into the room. My guest gets a smaller room due to availability and $20 off rate.\n\nThen tonight, it happened again with nothing in the system or a reg card. I check a guest into a room at 1230 am, they go up to the room about 2 am. Come down saying someone is in the room. I quickly get him moved to a new room apologizing.  He isn't happy, but he is in an upgraded room. \n\nThe guest in the occupied room had a reservation that was canceled at 530 pm through b--k.com. No paperwork for this guest, system showed room unoccupied & nothing signed.  I get him checked in, but again nothing is signed so he can easily dispute everything.

I used to work at another name brand hotel as a front desk agent. When I moved to this hotel, I was hired in sales. Now, it makes sense that I would have to learn the operating system (I knew Opera, they use FOSSE) so they had me train with the front desk for two weeks when I came on. Because of my previous experience, they asked if I would be able to occasionally cover lunch breaks when the FD manager isn't there or be able to hop in if it got super hectic. Sure, we all have to pitch it. Once I finished my training, I went to live in sales, and only covered the desk very rarely.\n\nEventually we lost a front desk agent. We were approaching the slow season, so I agreed to one shift a week until we were able to get by with the staff we have. A couple weeks at MOST since things were slow in sales. Great, only a couple of weeks! Or so I thought.\n\nDuring our weekly managers meetings, the GM kept encouraging the managers to come up with their plans on cutting hours\/staffing during the slow season and to keep the staff updated. Housekeeping shared their plans with the group. Food & Bev shared their plans. Front Desk Manager says she's still working on it. Theoretically, we should have been able to get by with the FD staff we had. \n\nFast forward to the slow season. I go one week without a full desk shift (hooray!) and I think it's back to before. Schedule comes out for next week. I'm on twice. Huh? FD agent has vacation. Whatever, I'll help. Next week? Two shifts again. Next week? Three shifts. It kept going on and on and on and on. Meanwhile, the few times I see the actual FDAs they're mentioning how their hours have been cut way beyond the full-time marker. Many of them were struggling to pay rent. They were asking for hours, even a couple more just to make ends meet. They were not informed that the cuts would be so dramatic and thus did not seek out other part-time employment or adjust as needed.\n\nTurns out the Front Desk Manager's plan for slow season was just to use me. Cut the FD staff hours and slap me on the desk to do their job AND my job simultaneously. There was never a moment where it was brought up to me. I'm not even next in command to work the desk. They just figured they could spread me thin and benefit on the payroll. \n\nWhile I know I'm good at working the desk- I left being a FD agent for a REASON. My physical and mental health cannot handle it. I can do the coverage for lunch, I can cover here and there, I cannot be a permanent FDA without ruining my body. (Cue another rant about not being allowed to sit. they don't even let the FDA with cancer sit) On top of that, my family was going through a horrible medical emergency as it was. Sales was also picking up, so I was following behind on my responsibilities by A LOT, which affects the entire hotel's communications.\n\nI finally broke when they slapped me on the desk alone when \\[prestigious university\\] opened bookings for their alumni weekend. 12pm I am flooded in calls. Completely overwhelmed. This led to a guest interaction that led me to a panic attack (I plan to post this story eventually). AGM steps in and takes over while I speak with my Sales Director about what just happened. He tells me I'll never work the desk again.\n\nI have a sit down with GM. I give almost this exact account.  His response? \"Working the desk comes with your position, I told you that when I hired you\" Uh, no sir, you does not. My application never had this responsibility listed. It was never mentioned during the interview. It was merely an occasional favor to watch the desk in extremely tight situations- not be the financial plan to save a few bucks. If I was \"the plan\" I should have been told, or am I crazy?? So now I'm in a position where it is being expected of me to work the front desk part-time or whenever they decide and I can't do anything about it. It's either deal with it or be put to part-time or leave.\n\nI love the hospitality industry but I moved to sales and not operations for a reason. Am I being irrational? I asked for better communication moving forward but apparently I was given \"ample notice\" and given the \"hospitality is always changing\" spiel. I feel taken advantage of, undercompensated, and quite honestly, burned out.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675980266.0},{"title":"You Could Just, You Know, Not Say Anything\u2026","author":"AngelaIsNotMyName","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10y5wr6\/you_could_just_you_know_not_say_anything\/","text":"People are so bad at small talk, it hurts.

This Sunday, as I'm sitting in the back office watching the cameras (it's slow, so I take the opportunity to get off of my feet), I see a police SUV pull up in the check-in area. I get up and go to the front desk, anticipating something stressful or annoying. However, the police come in and say \"we're just going upstairs.\" I respond that I'm happy not to be involved and continue checking in the man who walked in just before them. About 5 minutes later, the two officers leave without saying anything. Ok, strange, but clearly nothing I need to be worried about.\n\nThat is, until I get a call on the in-house line. It's the man who the police visited.\n\nGuest: \"Hello, this is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I just wanted to clear up why the police were here. I don't want any trouble and I don't want any involvement with the police.\"\n\nMe: (Thinking) Uh oh, here we go. \n\nGuest: \"There are fish in my pillow.\"\n\nMe: \"Excuse me? Did you say that there are fish in your pillow?\"\n\nGuest: \"Yes, there are fish in my pillow. It's like when you buy fish at a store and they come in that little bag. There were fish in there and it blew up and now there are fish all over the bed.\"\n\nAt this point, I'm thinking \"What in the hell?\" Maybe a housekeeper left a freshly cleaned room door propped open and someone got in and pulled a very weird practical joke. So, I relate to him that it's a very strange thing to happen and ask him if he'd like me to switch him to a different room. He says yes and I tell him to come down to the front desk and I'll move him. He arrives several minutes later and I make him new keys for the new room.\n\nMe: \"So, there are fish in your pillow? That's the strangest thing I've ever heard.\"\n\nGuest: \"Yes, and in the mattress too. You should get someone in from the BLM to pipe them back out into the river.\"\n\nMe: Just \"mmhmm\"ing because I don't know what on earth is happening.\"\n\nGuest: \"If you don't believe me, come up and I'll show you.\"\n\nMe: \"That's fine, I'll check the room a bit later, let's just get you into a new room.\"\n\nSo, he's fine with that and I think it's over (except for me checking the room). But he calls about 3 minutes later. This time he's on the outside line, not inside.\n\nGuest: \"Can you send someone up to help me? This room really creeps me out, I don't want to go back in there.\"\n\nMe: (I'm the only employee working at the property by this time and we have maybe 2-3 reservations left to check in) \"Sure, I'll be up in a couple of minutes to help.\"\n\nSo, I go up to the room and he's standing outside of it with a half-loaded luggage cart. He asks me to get the rest of the things from his room and help him move them to the other. Not a service we offer, but I'm happy to help when I have nothing else to do. So, I walk in the room to retrieve a few bags he has laying around and a couple items from the fridge. At this point I'm being careful and keeping a close eye on him because, though I'm 6'4\" and a mountain of a man and he's about 5'5\" and very small, I'm already questioning his sanity and motives. As I walk in he says,\n\nGuest: \"There's a woman in there too.\n\n\"Me: Startled, I look around the room (keeping him in my peripheral vision) and into the bathroom. \"I don't see anyone.\n\n\"Guest: \"Well, you can't see her now. But she was bothering me earlier and there are fish in the bed, see?\" At this point he pulls up the comforter and plops it in the middle of the bed so that it's bubbled up. \"See? Full of fish.\"\n\nMe: Pulling the comforter all the way back and folding it at the end of the bed, \"I don't see anything.\"\n\nMy response must have shaken him because he immediately says:\n\nGuest: \"I swear I'm not on drugs and I'm not crazy. Please believe me.\"\n\nMe: \"Sir, it's really none of my business one way or the other. Let's just get you moved to the new room so that you're more comfortable.\"\n\nHe continues swearing up and down that he's not on drugs, not crazy., begging me to believe him. As we're leaving the room he half shouts \"What's that!?\" and points. So I turn around (keeping a distance between him and myself) and look back into the room. Nothing. Then he runs over to the easy chair we have in the room and grabs a pillow \"Where's this from!?\" I was uncertain and said \"I'm not sure\" (turns out these are pillows we have in (almost) every room with such a chair, just for lumbar support). He asks if this kind of pillow is in any other room. I say \"I'm not sure, let's check your new room.\" That room does not have the pillow. He is now convinced that the pillow is haunted and that it's the source of a ghost of the earlier \"woman\" who was in the room with him. Apparently she's an old woman ghost who would... need lumbar support? So, I agree to remove the pillow from the room, though he won't be using that room any more. At this point, I'm just trying to make him feel more comfortable and calm him down. Again, he half shouts \"what's that!?\" but this time he has fixated on the ottoman in front of the chair.\n\nGuest: \"Who sits like that!?\"\n\nMe: \"Sits like what?\"\n\nGuest: \"Like that! I don't sit like that. I'm a short man, I don't sit like that.\"\n\n\"Like that\" was a bit underdefined. I had no idea what he was thinking. The ottoman is right next to the chair, exactly as a shorter person would have it if they were putting their feet up. Now he's convinced that the ottoman has something to do with the \"haunting.\" Before leaving the room, he flips it over upside down, kneels down, and appears to pray over it.\n\nSo, we get him in his new room and I manage to pull myself away from him and get back to the front desk after I assure him that I will take the pillow and put it in a safe place, that I will not check anyone into his old room, and that I will contact management and ask them if I'm allowed to burn the haunted pillow. He offers to help burn it.\n\nBasically the end of the story, except that 15 minutes later he called back to again insist he was not on drugs and to follow up with me on whether I had contacted management about burning the pillow. Now, if the police had not already been up to visit him, I might be inclined to call them just to check that he's well and not having a stroke or psychotic episode (probably, this is what a guest did, and that's why the police showed up). But, I assume the police came to the same conclusion I did... dude was having the trip of his life.  \n\n\nEdits: For better formatting.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675932947.0},{"title":"\u201cShe\u201d is right here if you have any questions\u2026","author":"AngelaIsNotMyName","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10xh6jr\/she_is_right_here_if_you_have_any_questions\/","text":"I think there\u2019s a general consensus that if you treat the person giving you assistance *like a person*, you\u2019ll generally get better service.

This is Vilaya speaking, how may I help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHello, is this Super Full Name of Hotel?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes it is. How may I assist you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Mary Sue from The Shuttle Service That\u2019s Supposed to Pick Everyone Up. Are there wedding guests in the lobby?\u201d\n\n\u201c-Looks at our bursting lobby- Yes there are.\u201d\n\n\u201c-Changes from professional to exasperated casual talk- Oh boy. Look. You see, the bride never paid us. Not even a deposit. So we told her we\u2019re not coming but we never heard back from her. I noticed the date and time and decided to check if she found a different shuttle. Is the wedding still at _:00?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh f-ck it is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m *really* sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Thanks for calling.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood luck.\u201d\n\nI hang up the phone, ignore my coworker who\u2019s looking at me confused and a bit worried, take a deep breath, move from behind the front desk so I\u2019m in front of it, and loudly clap my hands twice.\n\n\u201cCan I please have the attention of Jim and Jane\u2019s wedding guests. We have just received word the the shuttle will not be arriving, so please use your personal vehicles to drive to the venue. The Front Desk will be happy to provide the venue\u2019s name and address if that wasn\u2019t provided to you. Please remember not to drink and drive. Our bar will be open for drinks until 2am if you\u2019re a designated driver. Enjoy the wedding.\u201d\n\nPeople just looked at each other and walked out. I\u2019ve never seen a group leave a lobby so organized. I stepped back behind the desk and my coworker was looking at me with bug eyes. I looked at him and just said, \u201cI don\u2019t do \u2018shoot the messenger.\u2019\u201d He replied, \u201cI see that\u2026\u201d\n\nI go over to the bar to update them.\n\n\u201cExpect patrons tonight. The bride f-cked up the shuttle so hopefully there\u2019ll be designated drivers.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm yeah. We could hear that over here\u2026 Impressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. Hope you get tipped well.\u201d\n\nSomehow this became a story in the hotel and bar. When I talked with that coworker later in a circle with a couple other FD associates he said, \u201cYou should have seen it. She didn\u2019t pause for a moment. Just hung up the phone and walked out there without pausing. And literally nobody got upset at us.\u201d\n\nMoral of the story from me to anyone in customer service: Sometimes you have to leave no room for argument. Just state the situation and don\u2019t accept any pushback. I didn\u2019t let anyone get mad at me, the FD lady just telling them the situation, and they didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t let guests bully you for anything. Work on it and you\u2019ll get there.\n\nWhen you inevitably get into a similar situation, good luck.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675717267.0},{"title":"Bystander effect","author":"Hipnog","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10vlab5\/bystander_effect\/","text":"I work at a medium sized independent hotel as a desk jockey and, just like everyone else here, morning shifts include coding all the keys for the arrivals for the day. When they hired me they showed me how to code keys through this PITA interface that bugged out half the time, had a million things to click before you made the key, and even if you got everything right it still somehow got stuck sometimes for like a minute before it encoded the keycard.\n\nBut you see, whenever you check someone in in the hotel management software, it gives you an option to encode a key since the management software is integrated with the keycard coding software we use - but I, as well as everyone else, was told that that feature doesn't work and we have to manually encode every single keycard.\n\nSo one day, on a slow day I decide to poke around in the management software since I figure there HAS to be a way to get it working and - to my surprise, there was no need to get it working, because it already worked! And I know WHY people thought it was broken: After you code a keycard through the management software, you can't read key info through the encoding software for about a minute (No idea why! It just says that the key is blank or damaged) but the key works just fine.\n\nSo basically somebody tried it, then tried reading the info on the key and saw that it said it was \"blank or damaged\" and assumed that the easy option is a no go, told everyone else and everyone else believed it without checking themselves.\n\nTL;DR nobody bothered to check if \"broken\" feature was actually broken, and I can now make one keycard every 10 seconds (if not less) instead of one every minute.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675724928.0},{"title":"vent","author":"bobannnderson","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10vl6d2\/vent\/","text":"one thing i hate about the front desk is that i\u2019m usually the only employee on the property during my shifts.

A bit odd for the slow winter season, but here we are. There was some kind of college function, a sports event maybe, going on for the local university, so we had a big group of university parents spending a night or two at the hotel. \n\nI jump right to it with getting people sorted and checked into their rooms. First red flag: tons of these people kept turning around to talk with their friends or group while I was trying to check them in. Like I\u2019d be running the charges and printing out a registration card, and they\u2019d deadass turn around and walk away to chat with their friends. While there were other people waiting to be checked in. I had to repeatedly ask people to come back to the desk to finish the check-in, and they were annoyed that I kept asking them to come back.\n\nSecond thing is that a handful of these people took phone calls while I was checking them in. And some even had the audacity to tell *me* to wait a minute while they\u2019re holding up the rest of our arrivals. And just a note in general- if you take a phone call while I\u2019m trying to check you in\u2026 I\u2019m not telling you shit. Nothing. Not about breakfast, not about parking, not about check in\/check out times. In fact, I won\u2019t speak to you at all because it\u2019s rude as fuck. If you want me to continue giving you information and checking you in, then get off the phone for five minutes. \n\nOkay, now that I\u2019ve set the scene, here we go. Big group, primarily women, in the lobby being loud. Some of them even brought in lite beer and wine coolers. And people aren\u2019t supposed to be drinking in the lobby, but whatever. Two hours after I arrived and they were still in the lobby being loud. A guest arrived, and I was trying to get them checked in and answer their questions. Shocking observation here, but it\u2019s generally really difficult to hear someone when there\u2019s a group of people shouting nearby. \n\nThey asked a question and I couldn\u2019t hear them. So I raised my own voice and yelled, \u201cHey folks, I need you to quiet down please.\u201d A bunch of the women turned to look at me, and one of them immediately says, \u201c*excuse me?*\u201d I told them again, \u201cI need you to quiet down so I can hear the guest I\u2019m trying to help.\u201d \n\nI\u2019d barely finished my sentence before this lady turns back around to her friends and says, \u201care you kidding me?? Who does she think she is to tell *us* to be quiet?\u201d \n\nI grit my teeth and ignored it since they did quiet down a tiny bit- though it soon went back up to their original volume. I was able to finish checking in the guest I was with, and I go back into the office for a minute. As soon as I\u2019m back in the office, I hear that Karen in the lobby mocking me to her Karen friends.\n\n\u201cYoU gUyS aRe bEiNg ToO fUcKiNg LoUd\u201d *\\*group snickers*\\* \u201cBitch.\u201d \n\nThere were a few more mocking remarks, but I was too mad to pay any more attention to this bitch.\n\nWho do I think *I* am? Oh I don\u2019t know, maybe just the person responsible for handling guest satisfaction and any complaints for the entire hotel during my shift. Just the front desk agent who enforces rules meant to keep the environment safe and welcoming for all guests.  Just the person who has to think about the whole hotel and not just a few people staying in it.\n\nThat\u2019s who I think *I* am. I just wanna know who she thinks *she* is to act like it\u2019s an affront for me to ask the entire group in the lobby (not just her) to please quiet down so I can help someone. She was pissed. Apparently she thought she could do whatever she pleased without interference from an employee. As if she was the main character. The only one who didn\u2019t have to follow rules because she thinks that rules are for everyone except her. She is not the only person staying there, and contrary to popular belief, not everyone wants to hear the ugly hyena screeching sorry excuse for an indoor conversation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, to the loud, entitled Karen, I leave you this sentiment:\n\nFuck you.\n\n**Edit: y\u2019all. I\u2019m a small woman who works alone at night. I was exhausted and getting a bad migraine. I didn\u2019t claim to change this woman\u2019s whole perspective. I said she was disgusted and shocked that she had to follow rules created to maintain EVERYONE\u2019s comfort and not just her own. So no I wasn\u2019t going to upend 20 people (including a handful of large, drunk men) when they left shortly after I yelled at them anyway. If they\u2019d stayed for longer? Yeah, I would\u2019ve had them return to their rooms or face being evicted. I dislike all the nasty shit people are saying to me here. I didn\u2019t ask to be graded on my performance.

I have several jobs at the local museum, one of them being an occasional cashier at the front desk where I sell the tickets and souvenirs. Despite its name, it actually isn't right at the front of the museum and you can access the rest of the building without even approaching it.\n\nOn that day, we had lots of people coming in and out who were preparing the event. As a result, this particular guy managed to blend in rather easily. I was sorta aware of him, but there really were many people walking in and out at that time, wearing all kinds of clothes and carrying various equipment for the event. This guy was holding something that most coworkers who saw him assumed to be a camera with a small tripod. He asked someone for the bathroom, then entered the first exhibition and also tried to enter the rest of them (not possible though - they have turnstiles and require a ticket). So he returned to the ground floor.\n\nThe guy then walked up to me at the front desk and showed me what he was holding. It was a small telescope. No idea how he got it but I doubt it belonged to him. He said he needed money for the ride back home (which is a common thing to say when you ask strangers for money here). Then he tried to sell the telescope to the museum. I refused and he tried to sell it to me instead because you know, I was a smart young man who would surely like to own a telescope. I still kept saying no. No explanation, just plain no. He was trying really hard and not gonna lie, I was becoming very uncomfortable. Luckily, me not budging and repeating the same thing over and over helped. He left...\n\n...and tried to sell the telescope to the group of women he stumbled upon outside. They immediately went into the museum and asked whether he had stolen it from us. The management checked the cameras and I asked around the exhibitions, but he wasn't even able to enter the only exhibition which is related to the space (plus their telescope is much bigger). So yeah, luckily the guy already came with the telescope to the museum, even though he most likely stole it from somewhere.\n\nI don't mind dealing with problematic visitors (not that we get many, luckily) but it would be nice not to have to meet the telescope guy again.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675728145.0},{"title":"Update: Impending Doom and the Disappearing Keys (ft. A Guest Not Paying For Their Order)","author":"LaVieDrole","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10vh05x\/update_impending_doom_and_the_disappearing_keys\/","text":"Hello everyone! As you can see, this is an update of [another post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10szb7p\/impending_doom_and_the_disappearing_keys\/) I made. You'll need that one for context but I can make a TLDR real fast.\n\n\\------\n\nThe story so far:\n\nFor the last week or so at my hotel, I've witnessed our key supply dwindle from about thirty keycards down to one. I let a manager know we need more and thought it was okay, but it turns out they were never ordered and I discover our housekeepers have been throwing away our keycards when they find them in the rooms, hence the current situation. Through some scrounging, we conjured up eight of nine needed keys and yoinked a fob to use as our ninth key since we couldn't reprogram the keycards the owner borrowed from a nearby hotel. During this whole ordeal, I feel a continuing and growing sense of foreboding that I've dubbed Ichabod.\n\nGot it? Great.\n\n\\------\n\nOur Cast:\n\nMe, the teller of this somewhat stupid story\n\nManager, the manager of the front desk and bar\n\nGM, our old GM who no longer works at this hotel\n\nKid, a girl about 8-10 years old that was staying the weekend here with her Mom\n\nAlly, a server in the restaurant.\n\nJay, a fellow front desk agent\n\nManager II, the restaurant manager\n\n\\------\n\nPicking right back up where we left off, my night is not peaceful. It's somewhat slow, sure, but in the remaining four hours of my shift, I slowly begin to check in the remaining ten of eleven rooms, one key per room due to the shortage.\n\nWhile any impending doom is saved for tomorrow--we have one check-out but two check-ins, so even if that room returns their key, we'll still be one key short--I must remain at my post instead of considering tearing apart our office in search of keycards.\n\nInstead, I make some more attempts at turning the keys we borrowed just to entertain myself in between messages to an online friend, reading comments on the first post, and side-eyeing a still rather large Ichabod.\n\nIt's about another hour into my shift, however, Manager appears from the office with a deus-ex-machina.\n\nSee, our property has been open for about six months. The owners run mostly restaurants and this is their first hotel so we're really new. That being said, we also started out with a GM that some of you might have questioned the absence of in the first post.\n\nGM was a nice and somewhat eccentric woman but I liked her--she seemed protective of me and called me cute nicknames like 'sunshine'. Plus, she was really experienced in the hospitality business.\n\nAnd with that experience, GM was very good at preventative measures or preparing solutions to problems we may have in the future that we may have no control over now.\n\nSo, the lovely deus-ex-machina that Manager plops on the front desk that's about to save our little key shortage comes in the form of a card binder that was tucked into one of the office filing cabinets. It has a sleeve for each of our rooms and three keycards per sleeve.\n\nFor those who don't want to do the math, that's forty-two keys.\n\nGM may have moved onto another property about a month ago, but the second I see the binder and what it holds, I briefly consider calling GM to thank her for her foresight.\n\nI don't, but I still think about it.\n\nBut, now that I have keys to work with, I am all too happy to poach one from each sleeve so I can give the remaining guests that must check in two keys rather than one. And also give new keys to the kind returning guests who were understanding when I had to hand them a fob.\n\nI'm then left with four extra keycards to be used for our check-ins the next day--two for each!--and we still have another twenty-eight in the deus-ex-binder. (No, that's not a typo, I'm definitely calling it that now.)\n\nThe night is improved now that there's hope for the next few days and I finish all my check-ins right after 10 PM. Sure, I end up having to jump my car because the temperature has dropped to a nice, breezy -7\u00b0F with a windchill that drags it all the way down to about -30\u00b0F, but I make it home alright.\n\nWe move on to the next day where I have to jump my car *again* because it's still below zero and when I get to work, I have only three check-ins but now we have an almost full house. I spare a few keys from the binder to give to the new guests but don't want to pull any more than necessary.\n\nThere aren't any huge developments for this night, just needy guest things that I deal with easily and an odd switch where one family left early but wants to let their friends use the rooms for the second night they'd reserved. Our housekeepers have gone home for the day at this point, but one room hasn't been used and the other had been refreshed so it's all set. The people can take the room and everyone is happy.\n\nWhen I return to the desk, there's a good stretch of sitting around and waiting for something to happen. Now, this next part isn't highly relevant but it's an amusing interaction.\n\nA girl comes up to the desk and says, \"I need another key to Room 10.\"\n\nNo real greeting or 'please' in there, but whatever. \"Did you lose your key or do you just need me to let you in?\" I ask.\n\n\"My mom has a key but I want to go back before her,\" she says, staring at me expectantly.\n\nI think for a moment. Sure, we have keys in the binder, but I'm not willing to part with another if their current room key isn't lost. So I tell her, \"Okay, well, I can let you in--\" I hold up the master key fob \"--since I can't make you another key because we're having a shortage.\"\n\nApparently, this information did not enter the kid's brain because she says kind of obnoxiously, \"Yeah but I need a room *key,*\" as she mimes a rectangle keycard with her hands. In hindsight, I realize she quite literally wanted her own key, not just access to the room--I blame my neurodivergence for not picking up on that initially.\n\nBut still, to talk to me like that?\n\nWhat a little shit.\n\nYou're *definitely* not getting a key with that attitude.\n\nStill, I try to patiently explain, \"Yes, I understand that, but I can't give you one--all I can do is go back with you and let you into the room.\"\n\nThe kid makes the real-world approximation of a :\/ face then walks away.\n\nAs I'm unsure if she wants me to follow, I get up and watch her go into the tavern--which is in the room beside the lobby--get the room key from her mother, and leave. I slowly return to the desk and immediately tell an online friend about it as well as update the draft of this post.\n\nIt turns out this interaction will actually come in handy later as Ally comes to the desk, informing me that one of the tables came in and sat themselves, had a coffee and dessert, then walked out without paying. Ally knew they were staying with us but didn't know which room, so she, Manager II, and I use process of elimination to figure out which guest it had to be.\n\nI personally checked in nearly all the guests excluding two rooms but Manager II confirms it isn't those two. We also cross out two other rooms because one is a family of Asian descent and the other is a father and daughter. Another two are out because I checked them in earlier and they're all men.\n\nThis leaves five rooms--two of which with connecting rooms--to narrow down. We cross off three as they're all friends and eating in our private dining room to bring us down to two.\n\nWith only two options left, I can't definitively narrow it down until I remember the kid from earlier. I ask Ally which table the woman was sitting at and confirm it was the same one the kid's mom was sitting at.\n\nBingo.\n\nI can confidently tell them it's the guests in Room 10--who have stayed with us a couple of times--and relay the earlier interaction then put the bill on their room. Later, Manager hears about this and says he's spoken to them a good amount before. He suggests that since the woman is pretty entitled she may have assumed we'd know her and to put it on her room.\n\nHonestly, not a bad theory.\n\nBut with this, there isn't much that goes on for the rest of the night and I feel a surprising lack of impending doom.\n\nThe same goes on for the next day as I don't have any check-ins, so I spend the time chatting with my coworkers or tending our firepit. I go home and Ichabod has shrunk back to pillow size.\n\nAnd thankfully, after a whole week, when I go to work on Monday our new keys have arrived. Jay and I check to see if they'll work--the moment where I'm really holding my breath considering the other day when the keys we borrowed didn't work.\n\nBut...\n\nGreen light.\n\nThe key drought is over and Ichabod is gone.\n\nWeightless shoulders have never felt so good but I'll still be grabbing a stack of keys to hide in case of emergencies.\n\nThis is where our story ends, but who knows when the next Ichabod will come along.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675714877.0},{"title":"Are we gonna renovate or is that a reNO?","author":"poshgiraffe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10vmlxg\/are_we_gonna_renovate_or_is_that_a_reno\/","text":"So my hotel is a bit overdue for a renovation.

I'm back with tales from the weekend. Together with my partner, I run a quaint B&B in a mountaineous, heavily forested area. People usually come here for holidays, not work, and 99% of our guests are honestly lovely. I should also mention that we live in house with a direct entry to the guests' common room.\n\nLate Friday evening, something happened that I'd been hoping to avoid. My partner and I were both feeling a bit under the weather and just to be safe we both did a CoVid test. Wouldn't you know it - we both tested positive (and have daily in the days since). Damn. Right after checking in the first four apartments (plus a double linked to one) for the weekend, too.\n\nSo, here's a bit of a rundown of what happened over the weekend - some of it bad, some of it honestly super sweet. \n\nFriday, past midnight: Trying to call a certain OTA to cancel the bookings for the next days turned out to be a nightmare. The first info I got was \"okay, well, tough luck. You'll have to pay for guests' upgrades to the (only other nearby accomodation, happening to be a) four star across the road.\" This would've cost us a fair penny, on top of the loss due to cancelled bookings. It was like they never heard of the pandemic?! Long story short, despite worsening symptoms I spent hours waiting to be connected to or called back by supervisor after supervisor. By 2am they finally cancelled the guests' bookings free of charge to me - after I had separately wrote a lengthy email to all four rooms that were scheduled to check in that Saturday. Obviously I apologized for the short notice and offered coupons for a discounted stay at a later date. \n\nA few short hours of sleep later we entered saturday morning feeling like cr*p. Nevertheless, we had to get back up to notify the in-house guests of what had been happening. I offered free cancellations to all, but interestingly, all of them decided to stay. Luckily (for us as well as for them) all were apartment bookings and had kitchens stocked with coffee, tea and spices. Fully masked and disinfected, we somehow managed to stay on our feet long enough to offer a DIY breakfast: bread is delivered daily from the local bakery, so we put out milk, eggs, juice, jams, fruit etc for the guests to grab and prepare for themselves. We communicated via messengers to further minimize contact. All were happy and - if you ask me - remarkably unconcerned about the possible risks.\n\nSaturday, 10am. Finally we were able to catch up on some much needed rest. My throat was clogging up, my headache the worst I've had an a while and the fever quite bad. Sleep helped. A little.\n\nSaturday, 4pm. The doorbell. Ughhh. I answered through our app to avoid direct contact with whoever it was. Turns out it was a group of five whom I had cancelled (and tried to call) earlier in the day. They would like to stay please, since they didn't have a backup plan and had been looking forward to their holiday. I offered to call my other hotelier friends in the area to look for vacancies. Nope, they insisted on staying here, since they had heard such good things about us.\n\"Well, thank you, but honestly, I am really not feeling up to hosting you right now.\"\n\"Please, we have an apartment after all... we would even make our own beds if it helps?\"\nLong story short: I buzzed them in and put the freshly disinfected key to their apartment in the common area. If they were willing to put up with the risk... yeah, whatever. Let them. I'm past willing to deal at this point.\n\nSaturday, 5pm. I'm feeling a bit better - and got a text from some lovely guests (that I had had coffee with the last few mornings and felt terrible for exposing):\n\"Hey. Hope you're feeling a bit better. Please take a look in the common room, we left you a little something.\"\nThey had bought us herbal tea, ginger shots and chocolate. Awww.\n\nSaturday, 8pm. Text from a different group of guests to look in the common room (again). They had bought us cough sirup, fruit and tylenol. Damn. I really love our guests.\n\nSunday, 7AM. After 10 hours of sleep, I felt a bit better and prepared DIY-breakfast again. Ran into one of the guests who wanted to grab early breakfast. Told me to please not give them a discount (as I had offered due to breakfast not being up to our usual standards), since he appreciated us getting up for them so much. \n\nMonday (now): we're still very ill and I wish I could just sleep for a week without having to worry about the business for once. That said, I am also super happy about the genuinely nice and wholesome experiences we get with guests here. Wish we could just scrap OTAs alltogether, but well, I guess we're stuck with them for now...","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675680207.0},{"title":"We heard a bark nearby","author":"Both_Cartoonist_6770","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10v7b75\/we_heard_a_bark_nearby\/","text":"Heard about this thread, and I figured I'd post about a recent experience. \n\nI was working my morning shift 6am-2pm and updating a list of rooms our head housekeeping gave me. Suddenly, I could hear loud barking coming from down one of our side hallways. My hotel isn't pet friendly, so I'm used to turning guests away if they come in without a service animal. \n\nI walked around the desk and down the hallway to find a blue heeler locked inside the hotel corridor. Looking around, I can't find the owner nearby. At this point, I'm assuming somehow the dog was running loose outside, and a guest locked it in the entry to prevent it from getting hit. Unfortunately guest sneak in animals occasionally, but I couldn't understand if this was the case, why they would leave it somewhere so easily noticed. \n\nGuests were starting to complain about this dog, who is constantly barking at this point. So I round back to the front desk to ask a manager about advice for the situation. With my manager with me, we started heading back towards the corridor. And see two guests who are taking off with the dog towards a big company truck. Before we were able to get outside, they were in the truck and just pulling out.\n\nI wanted to bring this experience up because it annoys me how entitled people feel nowadays. Look, I get that dogs can be your best friend and you want to travel everywhere with them. I have one of my own that I would hate to leave behind. However, some hotels aren't pet friendly for a reason. We have guests who choose our hotel specifically because we don't allow animals. They don't have to worry about barking or allergies to dogs. And when guest see that one is inside, they feel disrespected and take it out on the hotel. Staff is supposed to make sure we keep non-service animals out and we get in trouble when management spots them inside. I know this will never stop, but please just pay the $50 pet fee or choose a hotel that doesn't have one. \n\nSorry about the rant, but some people need to hear it","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675692030.0},{"title":"Don't allow a person in my room to bring any guests.","author":"SuddenStorm1234","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10v0xbn\/dont_allow_a_person_in_my_room_to_bring_any_guests\/","text":"Okay, this is one of the weirder situations I've seen. Like obviously something shady, but just weird. \n\nDuring breakfast a lady- obviously a tweaker (who will henceforth be known as tweaker)- came down and asked for a key to her room. I asked her name- which was not on the room.\n\nShe said the room was under John Smith's name- it wasn't, it was under Jane Smith. Same last name, different first. \n\nI said I can only give keys to the person who's name is on the room. I asked if Smith was in the room, she said no. The address on the room was about 20 minutes away.\n\n She was annoyed, but said she would wait since she had a friend in the room. She sat in the lobby for about 20 minutes then came to the desk to get a key again. I called the number on file, Jane Smith answered. I asked if I could give a key to tweaker, Jane Smith responded that tweaker already has a key. \"She said she lost it\" \"incoherent muttering\". Meanwhile, tweaker is telling me to tell Jane to call her since she doesn't have her number. Or something. Again, weird. \n\nTweaker came down to the lobby with a guy, who also looked like a tweaker,\n\nThe room was due to check out the next day, but I wrote notes to keep an eye on it since the red flags were starting to pop up. At 11am I get a call from the room. \n\n\"Hi, this is Jane Smith in room 100, you know the lady in my room with me? I think her name is pronounced tweaker. Or however you say it. She isn't allowed to bring guests to the room. If she brings guests you need to stop her.\"\n\nI'm thinking *huh*? \"Ma'am, I have no way of stopping her from bringing guests to the room. Are you worried she is bringing bad people to the room?\"\n\n\"Yes I think so, well, I don't know them but she can't be bringing guests.\" \n\n\"Okay, I can't control who she brings to the room but if you have a guest who is bringing bad people to this hotel, the solution is for the entire room to check out.\"\n\n\"What? No I didn't mean that. Please don't kick us out. My ex husband is paying for the room.\"\n\n\"Ma'am, you just asked me to not allow her to bring guests to the room. If she is bringing people who shouldn't be allowed to the hotel then you all need to leave. Check out is an hour.\"\n\nShe pleaded a little bit to try and convince me to let them stay, but I didn't budge. Too much strangeness and red flags. \n1. The local address. \n2. An ex husband who isn't present paying for the room. \n3. The fact tweaker and Jane Smith don't actually know eachother, not having eachother's contact info and not knowing how to say tweaker's name. \n4. Asking me to act as a security guard\/babysitter because tweaker was bringing unsavory people to the hotel. \n5. They pleaded a little bit but seemed like they knew the jig was up and had been kicked out of hotels before. \n6. The email on the room was along the lines of 'sexymodel69', it looked a lot like emails common on fraudulent reservations.\n\nThey left right at checkout, and actually came down to checkout at the desk. The room was fine. I never saw tweaker and the guy leave the hotel, she did not leave with Jane Smith and the guy Jane was with so I assume they snuck out the back.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675669458.0},{"title":"These types of people are starting to annoy me more then anything","author":"omenfiend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10uw1ev\/these_types_of_people_are_starting_to_annoy_me\/","text":"Been working for hotels for about 2 years going on 3 now and people who refuse to do their own basic research or even listen are starting to annoy me more then the other problem guests we all get.

Yes sometimes people are just hard of hearing or I say it too fast or the connection isn't the that good. But like I said in the comments you can normally tell when that is the case. Also me repeating the greeting isn't me trying to be an asshole. It is just me verifying that Yes this is the hotel and my name is this.

I work at a relatively quiet property, but there's a few weird incidents that have stuck heavily in my mind - this is one of them.\n\nI work as the solo night auditor in a medium sized hotel in a heavily gentrified tourist town that's only a few minutes drive from a small city known for its fishing boats. It's a warm spring night, not quite the tourist season yet so we're only around 25% full and it's all quiet at the front desk. Keeping an eye on the parking lot as I read a book, I notice a strange man amble into view around midnight, a young guy in his early 20s. He's shirtless and wearing only a loose pair of sweatpants that's barely staying on him. Suffice to say that I could tell that he'd skipped the undies. He crouches down and stares into one of the basement level windows, one which looks into our (currently empty) fitness room. Obviously, this isn't going to fly.\n\nRunning outside and confronting him, the only thing I get from him at first is a confused stare - he's obviously extremely high and disoriented. \"Are you staying here?\" I ask. He's mumblinlg a lot and difficult to understand, but I eventually manage to get a 'no' out of him, he's definitely not staying here. I assume he wandered here from a nearby apartment complex and tell him that if he's not a guest here then he's trespassing and has to leave and return home. He nods complacently and wanders off down the street, holding his pants up with his hands as he goes.\n\nObviously that isn't the end of it. Half an hour later he's back, in our front parking lot, trying the handles of multiple cars. I run outside again.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I ask, exasperated. \"If you're not staying here you have to leave immediately. And you need to leave these cars alone!\"\n\n\"This is my car.\" he mumbles, gesturing to the shiny new car he was just trying to get into. \"I parked it here. But I gotta go now.\"\n\nThis is the point where I call the police. The guy obviously needs help and isn't going to find his way home on his own. They're here in only a few minutes, sit him down outside and gently question him while they wait for an ambulance to show up. Whatever he took, he took too much of and is going to need to recover in a hospital.\n\nOne of the cops comes up to me and tells me the guy's name. Weirdly, I think I recognize it. I look at the room chart for the night and see his name on our guest list, staying in one of the outside rooms.\n\n\"I'm not staying here,\" he clarifies afterward. \"I checked in but I gotta go.\"\n\nI get the full story from the guy's father later - the cops had called him because his credit card and contact info were on the room, and he called the hotel to arrange picking up his son's posessions. Seems he told his father that he was supposed to be in town to work out on the boats, which may well have been true - a disproportionately high percentage of the fishermen who stay here have big league drug habits, some of them better at functioning than others. My best guess is that he lost his grip on time and was trying to go to work, but who knows? Just hope he's doing better now than he was then. Just makes me tired now, seeing this stuff.\n\nOh, and this isn't really a surprise either, but his car was on the total opposite end of the property. And I'm glad he didn't find it!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675663063.0},{"title":"\"Can you just call?\"","author":"tirriveeish","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10uihls\/can_you_just_call\/","text":"Just dealt with the weirdest call at work.

I didn't know why he couldn't do it on the phone he was calling ME on but I called it on another front desk phone. Rings and rings, no answer, he tells me to call again. This repeats like 8 times. Finally I asked why he can't do it, he says it doesn't work on his phone. I'm suspicious and tell him I can't do this all morning, he asks me to call again and I call, still no answer. He asks me to call AGAIN so I hung up.\n\nDude calls back right away and asks me to call again. I asked him what room he's in and he doesn't tell me, just asks to call. I told him he clearly isn't a guest and I'm not going to help him. I hang up.\n\nFor the next hour, no joke, he keeps calling. I hang up on him every time but he doesn't stop. Sometimes I answer and tell him I'm not going to help him and that he's being a major weirdo but all he says is \"Can you call it?\" At this point I figure he has the phone shoved up his ass and wants me to call it so it vibrates.\n\nFinally after at least 100 calls I answer and tell him that I'm here all morning and not going to help him, he's being a freak and I don't understand what the point of all this is. He tells me that he just wants me to call. I tell him I'm not going to and he says \"You have to call, or else\". I said \"Or else what? What're you gonna do?\" \"I'm gonna curse you out.\" \"OK, go ahead\" \"OK... can you just call?\" what the fuck\n\n\nhe finally just stopped after I answered and told him that I'm here all morning and I see when he's calling so he's not going to get someone else and I'm not going to do it.

Not super busy or anything, just really dumb situations I did not want to be a part of. We had an event that night, so most of our guests were here for that. It was a Whiskey and BBQ event. I had been worried leading up to it that the event guests would get too drunk and be an issue. Surprisingly, all my issues were with the 10-15 rooms that were left over for people who didn't go to this event. Every person from this event was nice and just slept after the event. It was these other people just here for the casino that were causing problems. I'm going to detail these events in order,  as each instance was worse than the last.\n\nIssue #1 [A Cold Room]: Upon arriving at 11pm, I am informed a couple had complained at 4pm and 7pm that the heat in their room wasn't working. It was stuck at 63\u00b0. The first complaint was right after entering the room, which people complain about a lot. Usually, it's just that they think the moment they change the room to a new temp, it will instantly be there. We tell them they have to give it 30-45 minutes to get up to temp.\n\nThen comes the second complaint, and my supervisor went down to the room shortly after they had come to the desk (it was very busy and she couldn't leave the desk for a few minutes, but it was not that long after they had been there.), knocked on the door to come in and fix the sensor causing the issue, and no one answered the door. She was confused why they weren't there after just having asked for it to be fixed, but they had much more to worry about for the night, so she went back to checking in the event guests. She even attempted to call the number on file, but it was disconnected. They never came down again on her shift, so it gets passed on to me when I come in.\n\nAt about midnight, a woman comes up to complain that no one ever fixed their heater, and they're very mad at the lack of service. I explained that we had made an attempt to fix her heater, but no one was there. She claimed she didn't know she had to be there and asked why they didn't just go in and fix it. I had to explain to them that we cannot do that. Once they are checked in, we have to have their permission, and they have to be present for us to enter. I don't know how to fix their heater, so I have to move them to another room. I pick a new room for them and give the woman the keys.\n\nNot even 5 minutes later, I get a phone call from this new room with a man now speaking to me. He said, \"This room is also 60\u00b0. This is ridiculous. We need a new room again!\" I had to explain that when you get into a new room, it is set to 65\u00b0 and you have to set it to what temp you want and wait the 30-45 minutes for the system to kick on. It is not instant.  He said, \"That's what they told me earlier too!\" I explained again, in an ever so slightly different way, that I couldn't do anything right now, but if he gives it that amount of time and it's still cold, I will move them again. He was very mad about it but agreed. I never heard from them again, so I assume I was correct and that they just didn't understand how it works.\n\nIssue #2 [The Drunk Choosing Beggars]: At about 2am, a very intoxicated man came up to me and started telling me his night's story. Him and his wife came to the casino, and she was supposed to not drink to drive them home, but she was blasted. He said he spent all his money in the casino and demanded a free room. I just stared it him for a moment, incredulous why he thinks this was going to work.\n\nThe casino does Comp rooms for high spenders, but how that works is if you spent X amount of money last month, you get sent either 2, 4, or 5 free nights for this month. We don't comp rooms for people just walking up and asking. The hotel I work in is also separated from the casino, so we actually have nothing to do with the free rooms at all. We are given a list before each month begins, and we work off this paper list. We were sold out at this time as well, so I explained our comp system to him and how even if he did have a free room, it is not valid on weekends, so he couldn't use it for this day anyway. Not to mention that we actually didn't even have a room for him. We were sold out by this point.\n\nHe was very condescending and said, \"Oh, you must be new here.\" while laughing. I laughed back at him and told him I've been there over 2 years. He got loud and said, \"No, you're definitely new here. Casinos comp rooms all the time. I've been doing this since '96!\" I think he meant he's been gambling since I was 2 years old, but what does that have to do with anything? He then said, \"Not to pull the race card, but I think you're being really unfair right now.\" He is a black man, and this totally caught me off guard.\n\nI said, \"Sir, there is someone in every single room in our building right now. Even if I did have a room for you, you would have to pay for it. I have nothing to do with the comp rooms, and we do not have anything for you tonight. This has nothing to do with your race. Next time, if you don't want to drive home, plan ahead and reserve a room. We sell out very fast, and you can't just come up on a Friday at 2am expecting a free room.\" He started on again about me being new and not knowing how to do my job, so I said,\"Whatever you say!\", spun on my heel, and walked into our back offices. He left, grumbling.\n\nIssue #3 [Scammer Vs. Escort]: A half an hour before the last incident, a man who I recognized instantly came up and wanted a room. I was gone at the beginning of this, and my new coworker gave away our secret hold room to him, even though I was trying to save it for the couple from the first issue. I had a talk with her later about not doing that again, but she had already told him we had this 1 room left, so we had to give it to him. I knew I knew him by face and name, but I could not remember why. I knew we had some type of issue with him, but I didn't remember what. And he was never banned from the hotel or casino, so it must not have been super serious.\n\nSo we give him the keys to his room at 1:20am. At 3am, right before I was going to run Audit, he came up and handed me his check-in packet and said, \"I need a refund.\" He didn't give me any reason at all, and was like really confident about it, but in my head I was like what the fuck is everyone on today? I asked him what's wrong with the room and he said nothing. So I told him I cannot give him a refund. He checked in almost 2 hours ago. Not to mention he paid cash, so the cash was already in an envelope and dropped into the safe. No one with access to the safe would be in until Monday, 2 days later. He said he never went into the room, but I have no way of proving that, so I tell him as much and say that maybe in the morning a manager could refund him, but I'm not allowed to do that and cannot guarantee he'll be refunded. Especially without a good reason. He asked what time check out was, and I told him. He left without incident, and I never saw him again that night.\n\nLater on, a little before 5am, I see a woman come up, stumbling and wandering. She seems like she has no idea where to go, but I watch on the cameras as she bee-lines for the closed breakfast door like 3 times, thinking that's where the rooms are. I can tell this is probably not a guest of ours. She walks down to the elevator and takes it \/somewhere\/, not sure where, then comes back a few minutes later and sits by the breakfast room again around the corner from our front desk. It's a little weird, but nothing major. Just keeping an eye out.\n\nAt 5:15am, a different man comes up and asks for a key to his room. I ask for his room number, and he gives me the number of the room the guy tried to get a refund for earlier. I already know what's happened at this point, but I play dumb and ask if he has his ID. He says yes, so I pull up the reservation, and the guy is just standing there. I look at him, he looks at me. Silence. I say, \"Sir, I still need your ID.\" And he says, \"Oh, I don't have it on me.\" I apologize and explain that to issue a new key, I need ID. He quietly leaves but walks towards the hotel instead of towards the front door. I go in back and warn my coworker a situation may happen. I also grab the security walkie just in case.\n\nMy instincts were correct, as this man walks up to the woman from before and tells her he was denied. She immediately looks angry and starts stomping towards the front desk. I prepare myself for this nonsense. She has the check-in packet, the room number card, and the receipt I had just delivered to the room. She says she needs a new key. I ask for ID, and she says it's in the room. I explain to her that I need ID and it has to match the name on file. I'm trying to give her a hint that I cannot do anything without having to confront her about what has actually happened.\n\nShe says, \"My ID is locked in the room. I have all this [gestures to papers]. Just give me a key to my room.\" I confirm her room number again and then asked, \"Are you [Male's Name]?\" She started to get angry and said,\"No, I paid him for this room. It's my room now. Give me my fucking key.\" I told her that unfortunately, he would have to be here with his ID for me to issue a key. She starts yelling at me about how this is ridiculous and she accidentally locked her key in the room because she was grabbing the receipt I had delivered just prior. She also gets mad that I'm aware of this guy and his room and accuses me of being selective about who I help and wants to know why I even know about this room.\n\nI told her he had just come up to try and get a refund for this room right before she came up. I say I'm sorry for the situation she is in, but legally, that is his room. If he wanted to give it to her, he would have had to tell us her name to add next to his. Otherwise, he's the only one we can issue another key to. She then changes course and just begs to be let into the room once to grab her food. I told her I cannot do that, as letting her into the room is the same as me giving her a key. It's a breach of privacy.\n\nShe then starts rambling about how she told the security guards downstairs in the lobby that she was here and that they said something and that I need to talk to them. I told her that security has nothing to do with the hotel, and whatever she told them doesn't matter. If her name doesn't match on file, there is nothing I can do. This went back and forth for like 20 minutes of her stomping and whining, and in between the coherent sentences were several word vomit sentences I did not understand. She was under the influence of drugs and definitely looked like a lady of the night. I felt bad for her because her food was in there, and she technically got scammed by this guy, but there was nothing I could do. I cannot break our policy. She eventually left in a huff with the guy who had tried to get the room card before at about 6am.\n\nThat whole situation was super weird. I spoke with my manager before I left in the morning and she remembered the man who had bought the room by name! He had tried the same thing before a couple times on the overnight shift before I moved to nights. He buys a room for the free play that comes with it, then tries to come back  later in the noght and get a refund. It's really stupid because he spent almost $160 to get $10 in free play. I bet he thought he'd be able to just stop by and get his money back after, based on how confident he has said it to me. But even if we could prove he wasn't in the room (his room is just off frame for the camera), if he spent the free plays, there are no refunds. \n\nSaturday was my day off, so I'm not sure if he called to try and get a refund, but my manager was pissed he tried scamming us and then scammed some random woman, too. I'll know when I go in tonight, but he may be banned from the casino over it. That is very serious. I hope that $10 free play was worth it. So that was my crazy night on Friday.

I went to my old dinky Subaru to go warm it up. I can't remotely warm it, so lucky me gets to sit in my car and listen to it cry for euthanasia, when I was scared half to death by a man stumbling forward. He was probably in his 20's, and his nose was beet red. I figured either he had been out in the cold for a while, or he was drunk off his mind. By the way he had to catch himself from falling, I'd say the latter. He was in between some walls, hidden from sight. If my car had been a parking space over, he could have seriously caught me off guard, but I was thankfully in my locked car. *This is exactly the reason I tell my coworkers not to start their car and leave it,* I thought to myself, texting AM shift to be careful if she came outside; there was someone on the property that probably shouldn't be here. I watched as the young man emerged from his hiding place and walk away, heading to the main road. I resided myself to some Duolingo.\n\nFive minutes later, I see the man appear again. He literally just walked in a circle around the building to right where he started. He purposely didn't look at me, but I had no qualms looking at him. This was certainly strange behavior. Sure enough, he goes up to the Escalade right next to me and starts trying the doors. I honked my horn and climbed out of my car, shouting at him to \"stop fucking breaking into cars!\" Still not looking at me, he stuffed his hands in his pockets and haughtily walked away. Even though he was off the property, I still called 911. He could have gone behind the building again, and guests were eating breakfast, about to come outside and maybe be met with their car being broke in to. As I waited for police, I walked around the building, making sure he really was gone. I also called our sister property right next to us to warn them.\n\nI waited for an hour for police to arrive, but ultimately, I had volunteer work to go do. I left a description of the guy, my number, and left. My mom eventually told me that a couple of hours before this incident, there was a shooting at another one of our sister properties, so the police probably were all caught up. These two sister properties mentioned are literal shitholes, but my property is not, thank god. I would never work here if it was dangerous, but my bosses do dabble in a few shitty hotels as a treat. Anyways, the police showed up twenty minutes after I left and took a report. They told AM shift that they had multiple calls from other hotels that morning about this guy, so at least they're on high alert for him. He's very recognizable, so I'm not too worried about forgetting what he looks like.\n\nHe did pee on our building, though, so I think I caught him taking a drunk leak. Out of all the grass out here, he thought the wall was the best place. Good for him, I guess.\n\n\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675578532.0},{"title":"Discount for a good review?","author":"snowlock27","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10twdel\/discount_for_a_good_review\/","text":"Anyone else ever have someone ask for a discount if they give you a good review?

One night about two weeks ago at the hotel I call work, a mother and her eight-year-old son come to the desk to air a particular grievance about their stay:\n\n\nGuest: Hey, would it be possible for us to switch rooms? I was woken up by the neighbors twisting the lock on their connecting door. They wouldn't stop, and I'm just so unnerved right now. I'm traveling with my son, and I don't feel safe in that room anymore.\n\n\nOP: I'm sorry to hear about that, ma'am. I'll see what I can do for you.\n\n\nSince occupancy was pretty low that night, I'm easily able to switch rooms for the guest. I immediately searched for any two-double that does not have a connecting door, and found one far away from their current room.\n\n\nWhen making the new keys, I also included a breakfast voucher for the guest as a further apology for the experience she had to endure so far. They're overly appreciative of the effort I've made as I send them up to their new room.\n\n\nWhen I got back to work from a vacation, I notice the guest had left a positive comment about me and our interaction on the post-stay survey, complete with a perfect 10\/10 rating for the hotel.

We're bassically checking out the whole house last minute. It's Friday the day where the corporate clients are going home and the tourists are getting in.Tourists have a tendency to try to come in early and I'd been informed no early check in. Add onto that that we had a company book 40 rooms for their holiday party and those partied out guests were ringing the front desk left and right asking for late check-out (most of them denied). \n\n\nAs the infinite line of check out had just started to flow in a comfortable pace, comes in Cat Lady. Cat lady is with her grandchild and is old ennough that I would give up my seat on the bus for her. She has a bunch of stuff so she took one of our trolleys that are taking a lot of space . A cooler, suitcase, sleeping bags and a box covered by a blanket.\n\n\nI'm silently hoping the line moves in my favor, aka she goes to my collegue on the right instead of me. I have no rooms I can't check them in and I don't feel like dealing with that. But alas, she comes up to me.\n\n\nCat lady: Cat Lady, I have a reservation.\n\n\nMe: Hi, welcome. Actually check in time is at three, It is too early for check in right now. \n\n\nCat lady : Oh I know, I called earlier and was told I could leave my bags here. I'm just gonna pre register then we're gonna go eat.\n\n\nMe : alright no problems. We don't actually pre-register here but we'll do our best to accomodate you. I see you have quite a lot of stuff so you can just put this trolley next to my desk here. We are putting a priority on your kind of rooms so it should be ready in an hour. \n\n\nWhile she parks the trolley takes her grandchild's hand and heads to the breakfast place that's on the second floor of the building. I realise that between her cooler and under the blanket is a carrier. With a cat in it.\n\n\nThe cat is cool, doesn't look distressed is hanging out between what seems to be piles of stuff. I, kinda bewildered that she would leave an alive being to strangers, walk over to my manager's desk and explain to her that we just have a cat at front desk now. \n\n\nAs I watch my manager run to the second floor to intercept the guest I can't help but think : Biiiiiiitchh what ?!?!? I love cats but I'm not keeping that thing and a whole ass cooler next to me in the middle of the lobby like that.\n\n\n I Iook up their reservation and of course they didn't disclose having a pet so I don't have any  pet friendly rooms ready and of course we  have no double standard rooms clean yet. Cause CHECK IN IS AT THREE.\n\n\nGuests come back to the lobby looking and sit on our fancy rocking chair, cat lady is staring at me the whole time as if it'll magicaly make the room clean. Meanwhile her grandchild runs around and cause a little bit of madness but not destructive ennough for me to intervene. \n\n\nFinnaly at 11h15 we get a call for a clean 2 beds room.As I thought it was over and done for Cat lady Ask my collegue who's checking her if everything is ready for them. Collegue says yes of course we double checked everything is in place.\n\n\nCat lady : great I'm so glad we won't have to go outside and can rest now. \n\n10 minutes later I get a call.it's Cat Lady.\n\n\nCat lady : where is the litter box ??\n\n\nMe : I'm sorry? \n\n\nCat lady : there is a water bowl and a Cat bed the room but I don't see his litter box? \n\n\nMe : I apologize we are more used to dogs than cats.\n\n\nCat lady : the girl told me you had everything ready for me. What even was the 30$ pet fee you charged me if it wasn't for a litter box ??? For the price I paid this room  if I knew you didn't provide litter boxes I would have stayed somewhere else! We have been driving all morning. He's gonna have to go anytime now!! \n\n\nMe: let me check what we can do. \n\nQueue me looking around everywhere for a fricking litter box. Of course we don't have one in house. Most people who travel with their cats have their essentials as well. \n\nSolution? Intercept a server that was coming in for his shift ask him to buy a litter box, a scooper and litter for the guest, which took him an hour as each place he went to only had one of the items needed. Went up to their rooms at 1:00 pm brought the catstuff and was met with cat lady wearing only a towel that almost slipped when she got the items from my hands. \n\n5\/10 shift.

We were about 6mins away from the airport, and there was another same brand hotel right next to it.  I check in this 30ish lady, we\u2019ll call her Karen (this story could fit in that sub too!).  We do the check in chit chat, she says she usually stays at the other hotel but it wasn\u2019t available her first night, so she had decided to book her 2 nights at our hotel.  She asked if I could see their availability via my system, I said the computers aren\u2019t connected but offered to call and also offer our lobby computer to make any reservations.  She declines me calling the other hotel and says she\u2019lI use her phone later. I explain incidentals, confirm her 2 day los, checked ID, she inserts her credit card and I, very friendly, go over amenities, hours, our shuttle, open food places-all the normal hospitality spiel.  An unremarkable check in, or so I thought\u2026 cue the phone call-\n\nI\u2019m the only fda there for the evening, it\u2019s been about 2hrs since her check in, I answer and she doesn\u2019t even let me get out the \u201c good evening mrs\u2026\u201d before she shouts \u201cYOU HAVE THE STUPIDEST FRONT DESK STAFF I\u2019VE EVER EXPERIENCED!!\u201d She was one of like 3 c\/i\u2019s that night so I knew she was talking about me. I play ignorant and ask what happened. She says the girl (me) was rude, didn\u2019t know what she was talking about and had stolen her money. I inquired further how her money was stolen and she screams that I took out the incidentals. I explain them again (exactly as I did at c\/i), and she\u2019s still raving that the dumbass in front (me) did the math wrong. She saw the total when she inserted her CC. I break down the math, and explain the system auto calculates the total, fd doesn\u2019t input the amount. She then proceeds to insist the other  same brand hotel, that of course she stays at ALLLL the time, has NEVER, EVER taken any of her money at check in, no incidentals and was only charged for her room once she checked out. I explained that not just our brand, but every hotel has an incidental policy at check in. She now switches her insults to phone me, not the idiot who checked her in (also me). She can\u2019t believe how dumb I am making that statement, repeats how I was so stupid thinking thats a standard hotel practice to take a nightly incidental and how no hotel ever \u201csteals\u201d the guests money upfront.  At this point I\u2019m just amused with her angry ramblings and wondering if I should start counting how many times she calls both of me stupid. She wasn\u2019t getting anything from her first two rages, so now she moved onto the give me my money back phase. I explain the whole- even if I release the funds it takes a few days blah blah blah. No your room won\u2019t be comped and again, hotels require rm+tx+inci for the entire length of stay, I can\u2019t refund you for tomorrow, tonite.  \n-Now heres where I discovered where I think her entire issue stemmed from \nKaren indignantly asks \u201cSo I changed my mind about staying a 2nd night and you\u2019re still going to charge me for it?!? I told that stupid fd girl I might not stay the 2nd night (lies), but she didn\u2019t listen and stole my money!\u201d Insert some more childish name calling, with a few more repeats of her asinine arguments of \u201cthis has never happened anywhere\u201d and we circle back to her angry about being charged 2 nights. I state, her rez was for 2, she had originally booked 2 and there were no notes about early departure. She keeps insisting the incapable front desk moron (still me), added another night when she stated the other hotel was sold out, and how she had asked if I could book the other hotel for her 2nd night but I rudely refused and how she was undecided on that 2nd night and shouldn\u2019t have charged. I then say \u201cwell you told ME this at c\/i: I repeat the actual convo\u201d. Her response\u2026 \u201cWell you should have known I might change my mind! I\u2019ve never dealt with someone so stupid in my entire life!\u201d and finally hangs up.

That ends today as something has been going on the last few days. Also, I'm not on mobile, names are changed, and English is my first language but be gentle with me and I hope you enjoy this story.\n\n\\------\n\nCast:\n\nMe, the teller of this somewhat stupid story\n\nManager, the manager of the front desk and bar\n\nOwner, one of the owners of the hotel\n\nJude, a housekeeper\n\nKay, a fellow front desk agent\n\nJay, another fellow front desk agent\n\n\\------\n\nThis story starts about a week ago when on my shift (3 - 11 PM), I look in the front desk to grab a keycard. Sidenote: we use keycards that can be reused and reprogrammed, so the front desk doesn't throw them away unless they stop working\/are bent\/damaged in some way.\n\nIn the drawer, there are about twenty to thirty cards for our new little fourteen-room hotel for a booked weekend.\n\n*A bit of a tight squeeze but that doesn't matter,* I think to myself, *we keep the backlog in a different drawer.* I check the other drawer and... nothing. No keycards.\n\nI check the office. No dice.\n\nTrying to ignore the impending doom I can feel lurking over my shoulder, I put in our shift recap that we need keycards ordered but that we'll be okay for the weekend since we're pretty dead during the week. I also tell Manager in person. Later, he informs me that he's passed the message onto Owner and that more keycards have been ordered.\n\n~~(If that actually happened, though, we wouldn't be here.)~~\n\nBelieving that things would be alright, I continue on with my night and end up chatting with Jude.\n\nI rarely have contact with our housekeepers due to the timing of my shift, but upon speaking to them, I realize something. Housekeepers have borrowed keycards from me when they forget their personal keys and need to get into the rooms. But they've never returned them to me.\n\nI decide to ask Jude what they do with keycards they borrow from the front desk or even find in the rooms.\n\nJude hums a little and says easily, \"Oh, those? They're disposable so I've just told everyone to throw them away.\" They see nothing wrong with this.\n\nAnd suddenly, I understand where all our keycards have gone--accidentally taken by guests and thrown away by our housekeepers.\n\n*Who the hell just assumes our keys are disposable, though?!*\n\nI want to hit my head against the wall.\n\n*Seriously, they didn't even ask anyone what to do with the keys--just assumed they could throw them away.*\n\nAfter collecting myself and nicely but firmly urging Jude to please return the keys to the front desk when they find them and tell the same to all the other housekeepers, they go home while I sit at the desk with my new knowledge. Despite my annoyance, I'm satisfied in knowing how we reached our key shortage and am hopeful that I'd prevented any future catastrophe.\n\nWe move on.\n\nA few days later, the hotel is nearly empty again and all check-outs are complete for the day.\n\nI clock in, go to the desk, but when I open the front desk drawer...\n\nEven *fewer* keys than before. About seven, if I remember right. It doesn't match up with how many there should be, but I suppose that some of the guests walked off with them. It happens.\n\nStill, I reassure myself. *That's fine, Manager talked to Owner and they ordered the keys. They'll probably get here on my days off.*\n\nI leave it be. It had only been two days since the keys were ordered and we've got until Friday to have enough keys for all our rooms again. This night is quiet and I head home, happy to have my days off. They're uneventful and I return Thursday relaxed and refreshed. Clock in, go to the desk, ready to hang out with the AM guy until 5 PM when he heads home.\n\nI open the front desk drawer, a habit I'm now forming in order to check our key supply.\n\nThere's *one* key.\n\nFuck.\n\nThe impending doom is back on my shoulders and it's gained a few pounds.\n\nThankfully, since we're such a small property, the Owner is often on-site. After informing Kay of the key predicament and catching him up on all that I'd learned, I speed-walk to the office.\n\nPopping my head in, I spot the Owner and say, \"Hey, Owner, I just wanted to ask about the keycards. Do you know when they'll be getting here?\"\n\nOwner turns in his chair and asks how many keys we have left.\n\nI have our remaining key in my hand and hold it up. \"One. Plus the two the current guests have, so three if they give them back.\"\n\nThe face he makes is somewhere between startled and confused before he switches in problem-solving mode, which I leave him to. Behind me Kay is somewhat amused--mostly because he has the next couple of days off so it won't be his problem--but suggests he and I go check the different sheds around our property to see if there may be any boxes or spare keys laying around.\n\nWe divide and conquer.\n\nWhile I check our laundry shed for loose keys, Kay checks the housekeeping cabinets that are by the rooms. Nothing in either, but we regroup and check the final shed. There's a box in it branded with the same name as our keycards, but it just has some cables, which is decidedly unhelpful but at least we tried.\n\nKay offers to check all our now-empty rooms and heads off to do that while I ask my coworkers to keep their eyes out for keycards. When we both return to the desk, Kay's got a few small pieces of trash and we muse about how thorough our housekeepers are. Oh, the irony.\n\nWe decide that, while it's not much, we both have keycards on us that we turned into master keys (there's a keyring with a master fob, but we kept accidentally leaving with it). Kay and I give up our keycards, bringing our sum total up to three. Five, if we include the ones our only guests currently have. It's progress.\n\nLater, after Kay has left, I'm informed by Manager that Owner has now ordered keycards with overnight shipping. This news does not soothe the lurking doom, which has grown enough that I consider giving it a name. Maybe Ichabod--something suitably weird.\n\nWith nothing else to be done about the situation, I tiredly ask Manager about the original order that was supposedly put in, but it seems Manager assumed Owner would have ordered them upon being informed we were running low. Great. Wonderful.\n\nWhen I go to sleep that night, I am not excited about what tomorrow brings. Ichabod would make a good pillow if he was more tangible than an ominous sense of foreboding.\n\nToday rolls around. It's Friday, wonderful Friday, where I have eleven check-ins today and two tomorrow. I go out to my car and it doesn't start. Damn this cold weather. (As I type this, it's literally one degree outside.)\n\nI call the hotel and inform my other coworker, Jay, that I'll be late. I eventually get to speak to Manager and learn over the phone that not only have the keycards still not arrived but that he and Owner are contacting nearby hotels to see if they have the same kind of keycards and if we can borrow some.\n\nIchabod is big enough to ride in the passenger seat and after getting my car to start, I tell him to buckle up because this ordeal still isn't over and that I wish he was Buttercup the Unicorn.\n\nWhen I arrive at work, Owner has already left to drive about an hour--there and back--to get keycards from another hotel because we're getting desperate.\n\nTo myself, I think, *What if the keys Owner brings back don't work?* Then I immediately cut that train of thought because we don't need that kind of negative energy when we have Ichabod lounging on one of the lobby couches.\n\nI clock in and check the desk. We've got eight keys. Honestly, it's a miracle they scrounged up three more keycards even if it's not enough.\n\nEventually, I get distracted by having to make daybeds for two of our rooms because our housekeepers didn't make them--another ongoing problem that I wouldn't care so much about if I didn't have eleven check-ins to worry about on top of the single-digit temperature and windchill that makes it hurt to be outside. Jay mans the desk while I do this and checks in one of the rooms that needed a daybed right after I finish it.\n\nI pat myself on the back for this because at least something is going right, then head back to the desk after I finish the second daybed.\n\nThere's a few small tasks for me to do, so I do them while Jay continues to watch the desk.\n\nWhen I return next, Owner has also just gotten back. Yes! Hooray, we're saved!!\n\nJay tries to key one of the borrowed cards.\n\nRed light. Error.\n\nHe tries a few others just in case.\n\nRed, red, red.\n\nWe're fucked again and I'm considering changing careers to work as a seer. Or a fortune teller.\n\nI can ride Ichabod home if my car doesn't start again.\n\nOur final resort is to give each reservation one key as two reservations have connecting rooms, which brings us down to only needing nine keys. You may remember that we only have eight keys, not nine, but Manager has a fob key he doesn't really use.\n\nTo get our grand total of nine keys, he gives it up for the weekend and it's re-keyed to one of the rooms to be given to a repeater guest that's been rather polite.\n\nAnd that, wonderful readers, brings us to the present. I've got four hours of my shift remaining, Ichabod in the chair next to me, and ten check-ins to go, but maybe I can add an ETA tomorrow if there's any developments in this story.

I'm usually a very strong person, but I just had a super Shiney rock yell at me for ten minutes because he wasn't automatically upgraded on a sold out night that I'm working alone, i cant stop crying now, i feel so broken anymore.

I just got off work and my blood is still boiling. I\u2019m mostly mad that I didn\u2019t say anything when this happened. \n\nFor the past few weeks, my hotel has been gearing up for Mardi Gras. We are right in the thick of all the action, so people want to come stay with us. We\u2019ve been preparing rooms, policies, and security. But there\u2019s only so much prep you can do for the actual people. Free stuff and alcohol bring out the worst in people, and if they\u2019re already the worst, you\u2019re gonna have a bad time. \n\nSo I\u2019m at work today for my 3-11 shift, with everything nice and neat and prepared. Paperwork is in order, doors are locked, signs are up, fridges are stocked. The guests I checked in were decent enough. Usual level of annoying, but nothing I can\u2019t handle. Parade comes and goes, people come back like they haven\u2019t lost their minds. Some go back out to Mardi Gras balls, others to hit the bars. Because of this, there was a good 2-3 hours of my shift that was dead quiet. Security guard was even bored. \n\n10:45\u2026 golden hour. My relief arrives early, and I\u2019ve already got my notes to pass along from my shift. It\u2019s at this time a woman shows up at my locked doors, waving frantically for me to let her in, completely ignoring the sign telling her to go around to the other door. I basically \u201cYMCA\u201d to her to read the sign. She does, and she disappears. \n\nShe appears at the correct doors, and confirms she can\u2019t read by asking about parking, which is thoroughly explained twice on the doors she just walked through and once on the sign she was standing in front of. Moments later, two girls appear at the door wearing dance gear, and she goes to let them in. A couple minutes after that, another woman appears, at the correct door, also waving frantically to let her in. This time, the security guard goes over to do his job and verify if she\u2019s a guest or not. \n\n\u201cIM STANDING OUT THERE SCARED! IM JUST TRYING TO GET IN!\u201d she screeched. \n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, you need a key to get in,\u201d the guard explain, visibly wondering why she didn\u2019t see the two signs on the door explaining how to get in. \n\n\u201c\ud83d\udde3\ufe0fIM! JUST! GETTING! HERE! How would I get a key if this is my first time in here?!\u201d\n(Again, this is explained on TWO signs. Maybe her flailing hands blocked her vision, but that\u2019s honestly not our problem.)\n\nI could feel my blood pressure rising. I had had a surprisingly good shift, only for it to be ruined by a dance mom with the audacity to scream at a man with a gun.

My housekeeping team is a family, Mom and two daughters (ages 18 & 16).\n\nOur checkout time is 10am, which is a little early by industry standards. Because of this, people aren't always out on time as they didn't realize our checkout time is 10 instead of the standard 11.\n\nWe are entirely contactless, much like an AirBnB, guests make reservations and their room numbers and key codes are texted to them the day of their arrival. They don't have to do anything to formally check in or out. Since we are so small, we can usually tell who is in their rooms based on the cars in front. Everyone just parks in front of their rooms.\n\nThey have been working for me for about 8 months and over that time, the youngest daughter has walked in on naked people about 3 times. The mother is extremely mama-bear and the girls are very sheltered... I actually only ever hired one of the daughters and the mom took it on as like a whole-family job LOL which is great. One of those 3 times that the young daughter walked in on people, it turned into a big blow-out where I had to come down to the room and force them to leave because they were extremely disgruntled at realizing they didn't have an extra hour and being walked in on by a teenager during sexy time. The mom got down to the room before me and they actually slammed the door in her face, breaking our door.\n\nThe morning of New Years Eve, my assistant manager on duty arrived at check-out time to help the ladies start pulling bed sheets since we were full back-to-back. She just wanted to be helpful because she was new. The housekeeping team saw this act as my assistant manager arriving at check-out to make sure that everyone left on time so my housekeepers wouldn't be delayed.\n\nSince this, the mom has approached me and said that I should be doing that every single day (not just busy days, I asked). She wants me to knock on all the doors and tell people it's time to leave, and they will enter once the guests are 100% gone.\n\nShe posits that it is my job to do that because they are housekeepers and should not be responsible for guest interactions. I told her that the girls need to KNOCK ON THE DOORS LOUDER AND ENTER SLOWLY if they think someone might still be there! I said it's certainly not their job to deal with disgruntled guests who are refusing to leave on time... but yeah, it is their job to knock on doors and go in when they are ready to start cleaning. I said if guests were mistaken about check-out time, the way that they know it's time to go is because housekeeping comes around to clean. It is too abrasive to have the manager going around evicting people at check out time, since I'm obviously not a housekeeper... it seems weird and jarring and uncomfortable for me to do that.\n\nIt's like... how do I even put this \"job requirement\" into words? That yes you have to knock on the doors and yes you might run into people sometimes. That is part of your job.\n\nPLEASE tell me your thoughts on this, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!!!!!\n\nP.S. I have since purchased red door handle signs that say CHECKED OUT, which I will make clear as a new check-out protocol for guests... please hang the checked out door tag on your outside handle when you leave. Easy peasy. However, I'm sure some will forget or ignore that, what am I supposed to do about these housekeepers refusing to knock on doors now? We are a small town and it is REALLY hard to find good help.\n\nGive me all your feedback!!!!\n\nEDIT: THEY ARE ALL PAID UNDER AN LLC THE MOM FORMED. I hired the older daughter and said I would need to hire her help, the mom said she would help, which turned into the mom actually liking the job and forming an LLC that they are all paid under.\n\nEDIT: THEY DO \"KNOCK.\" They don't want to admit they aren't knocking loudly enough or announcing themselves loudly enough. They keep telling me that guests can not hear them, but I know that these girls are very timid and their \"knock\" is definitely the issue.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1675392667.0},{"title":"The Events, As They Happened\u2026","author":"AngelaIsNotMyName","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10s5pqd\/the_events_as_they_happened\/","text":"A very interesting series of events just happened at my front desk.

The girlfriend comes to retrieve her food, telling the dasher she had been messaging back and forth with her, with instructions to meet in the lobby. The dasher blames the app and dashes away. \n\n-Boyfriend comes to my desk with 4 pot pies. I ask him if he\u2019s paying with cash or card (if it\u2019s cash, I can take it at the desk.

AM shift pointed him out and told me how great of a guest he was; I never spoke to him, but apparently he was quite the witty person. This man happened to be confined to a wheelchair, which does happen to be important to the story.\n\nAnyways, I was told he was a resident of my city, which is against the rules. We do not rent to locals. I asked why he had spent the night if he was a local, and AM told me there is a assisted living facility in town, which was news to me. This man's room was being renovated and he asked to stay at our sister location across the street. It went through the owner, and the owner himself bent the rules and let the guy stay for however long he needed. I made a comment about being shocked the owner would do this, since they are heavily anti-local, but I was quite pleased with the situation.\n\nBut then it dawned on me. I questioned why if this man was supposed to be at our sister location... why was he at this hotel? AM shift looked a little uneasy before telling me that the guest had apparently urinated and defecated all over the bed, effectively ruining the mattress. Now *that* was a shocker. After this was relayed to the owner, instead of kicking him to the curb for destroying a whole mattress and fouling up a room, they sent him to our hotel for a second chance. Again, surprising, because my bosses aren't the type of people to be so nice. I love them, but the moment you cross them, things get dicey. They are very protective of their workers and property. I wondered why there was a second chance, but again, I was happy there was some leniency for the lad. I don't know much about handicapped people, but I was under the impression he was incontinent. It wouldn't happen again, right?\n\n*Well*.\n\nIt happened at our location. He defecated on our mattress, piled the feces into a towel, and called for room service to dispose of it. When the owners found out, they ordered him out immediately. In the matter of one week, he fouled two rooms at two hotels. I don't know much about his removal, but I definitely was scared to do laundry and accidentally touch something I didn't want to. All was well (or so I thought), until this past Tuesday, when I got a text from one of my coworkers. She said she kept getting calls all night from the once nice man's friends, calling her ablest, horrid names, the whole nine yards. Mind you, this is a random employee. We don't make rules, nor had any part in his removal. I told her to notify the manager of the harassment and went on with my night.\n\nAnd that brings us to tonight. As I was relieving the PM shift, somehow we got on the conversation about terrible recent guests, and this man was brought up. I told PM shift about our coworker's nasty phone calls from that man's friends, and PM shift told me that wasn't all that they did. They were now leaving false reviews that were flagging our franchise's management. I was floored. I went to our comments and, sure enough, there are horrific reviews. Here are a few:\n\n\"*Manager is treating people badly and illegally barging into rooms without permission because he thinks someone \"stinks\" very rude and discriminatory towards the handicaps . As a Muslim it hurts my feelings that another Muslim would treat a person like this*.\"\n\n\"*My wife was breastfeeding our boy and the manger barged in and saw my wife\u2019s DDD milkers!!*\"\n\n\"*I witnessed the new manager \"\\*\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*\\*\" allow himself inside one of the guest's rooms uninvited and hoist an disabled adult male out of his wheel chair to drag him out of the hotel while he was supposedly in the middle of using the bathroom, the manager was screaming at the parapalegic who of course retaliated in correspondance. Overall subpar quality and this discrimination towards the disabled is unacceptable, overheard that they specifically \"don't like people that look like that*.\"\n\nI was not there or informed on what happened to remove the man, but never in a million years would my boss drag a handicapped man out of a room like that. If push came to shove, police would have been involved. There are so many awful reviews, and with them being as horrific as these, it's no wonder the franchise is getting involved. But I am also disappointed with my boss because now there is a flood of stellar reviews made all today. With us being a small hotel, I really doubt these were all made by actual guests. Just a bunch of fake reviews on both sides, now. But the boss is working with the franchise, that's all I know.\n\nI tried to type this as appropriately as I could. Please let me know if I said anything offensive, because that was truly not my intention. Even with our no-local policy, I have let a few people in when there is a problem at their own residences, like frozen pipes and whatnot, but I guarantee there is going to be a huge crackdown. Dishonesty is my biggest pet peeve, and I feel helpless in this situation. I know I don't have to worry about it since I'm just the NA, but I hate seeing my bosses go through this. That doesn't mean I'm okay with these seemingly fake positive reviews, but I hate that the one time the owners let a local in, it was thrown back in their face. They are super nice, peaceful people.\n\nThanks for listening to my little rant. Again, I mean no offense. Thank you, and have a nice night :)\n\n\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675409698.0},{"title":"No money.......","author":"CaringBubbles","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10s84ur\/no_money\/","text":"So tonight was interesting. \n\nI work as a night shift admin and night bartender at a 3 star hotel, we have billiards at the bar.\nI had these 4 guys come to play some 8 ball pool, 2 locals and 2 foreigners.\nThey played and had some beers, then one other local started to whisper to one of the foreigners that those two locals are trying to scam them or something, after a bit the foreigners left, and the 2 locals had to pay their whole 8ball pool bill, but as it turned out they had payed their last money to taxi that took all 4 of them here, and they suposedly had an agreement that locals pay for taxi but foreigners pay for the 8ball pool.

They are nice people, but have that stereotypical \"old people crankiness.\"\n\nSince they got here, I've noticed that a lot of our inventory with breakfast & the coffee station started going quicker, specifically oatmeal, green tea, and our special flavored teas. I had a feeling it was them because the rate that they've been getting low has been much quicker than it usually does, even during sold out weekends (plus, oatmeal and the teas are not that popular here and typically we need to restock them for guests once a week average). To not make this sound like a witch-hunt, this happened even on days where they were basically the only people who were inhouse or the only ones who came down for breakfast\/coffee.\n\nSince they've been here, restock has been daily. We had to buy more stock than usual for both, but it still depletes quickly.\n\nNow green tea specifically, I put out between 10-15 bags when I am the morning shift, and after breakfast each time I'm here, they are all gone (even on days where they were the only people down for breakfast\/coffee).\n\nNow that there is some context, fast forward to this morning. We only have five bags of green tea left total. The morning prior I put the remaining bags out and it was like 14 or so bags and told management that we needed more that same morning. Since we only had three rooms in house the previous night going into today, I believed we could survive on four bags and I could get some more after my shift if we totally needed some.\n\nI got in, checked breakfast (nothing was touched, shocker) and night audit said he saw nobody all night\/morning. That was the same with me through 9am when the couple came down a few minutes before breakfast was supposed to be closed. We say our good mornings and they grab food.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the wife comes to me and asks if there are any more green tea bags. I ask her if we were out and she says there were only five bags left. I then ask her if she needed more than the five bags and she says she needs like ten or so more. I tell her that what we have out is all we have left unfortunately and we won't be getting more for a little bit. She gets cranky that that there isn't enough (she isn't necessary mad, just kind of like that old person \"I have no patience\" type of thing. Don't know how to describe it).\n\nLet me put some math out there before I continue: if she needs \\~15 green tea bags a day every day, that is over 100 bags a week, and about 450 bags a month. Seeing as how a standard box only has like 20-30 bags in it and the Costco bulk has (iirc) six standard boxes in it, we would need to buy a Costco box every week just for her alone. For context, before they showed up, a Costco box would last us AT WORST a month, but usually two months average.\n\nOf course, I'm not going to call them out for taking literally all our green tea, so I just apologize again and told her that we will get more green tea out there as fast as we can. She grumpily says ok and grabs her breakfast before going back up to the room.\n\nBut I really don't like these types of people. I used to be that type of person who grabs as much \"free\" stuff as possible to potentially use later (even weeks after I leave the hotel), but since I started working at one, I realized that these people kind of suck. Not only does it limit other guests from having said items \\[green tea\\], but it does put a hole in our inventory and makes us lose money (and this couple has the cheapest rate possible since they are staying for months). I mean, if you are going to actually use it, then that's fine; go ahead and take it. But unless they are making pitchers of green tea and drinking gallons of the stuff daily, who really needs 15 bags a day?","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675274263.0},{"title":"Read before you book please...","author":"IkeaKat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10r48me\/read_before_you_book_please\/","text":"Background:\n   So I am a FDM for a popular party hotel.

We started the new year with four people on the management team, and now...well, keep reading.\n\n\\-----\n\nOur story starts on New Year's Eve. Or, more accurately, New Year's Morning. The front desk supervisor is a woman who trained me, who taught me all sorts of stuff, and she's one of the more popular front desk employees with guests because she's very boisterous and outgoing. Lately, she's been complaining that she doesn't really *need* this job, that she's about to start her own business and she's only there so that she can leave on good terms. She's my relief for the morning! A bit unusual, but not unheard-of. \n\nGuess who neither calls in nor shows up?\n\nVery unusual for her. Very VERY unusual. This is not something she's done at any point in the past. Management texts her, I text her, I want to know if she's okay...nothing. It's like she's vanished off the face of the earth. I'm doing audit again the next day, and she's again supposed to be my relief! Again, pretty unusual, but weird things are happening with our schedule, so whatever.\n\nNo-call-no-show #2...in a row.\n\nAt this point, she's gone. You don't get to pull a no-call-no-show twice in a row over a holiday weekend and keep your job. Unless...at this point, I fear the worst. I know what the holiday weekend can be like. I know how crazy people are. And I know that the only no-call-no-show I've done in the past was when I was in a hospital and I didn't call in because I *couldn't*. So I'm having these visions of her in a car wreck or god only knows what. Anyway, she wasn't scheduled for the next few days in the first place, so we're kinda left wondering. Her next shift is at the end of the week, on Friday. Of course, someone is scheduled to cover, because no one has heard from her and we have no reason to expect her to come in.\n\nGuess who rolls in for her shift as if nothing happened?\n\nFive minutes later, the FDA who was scheduled to cover shows up. The two of them *hate* each other with a passion, so things get *super* awkward. Eventually, supervisor gets a message to call AGM, and she leaves. We haven't seen her since.\n\n\\-1 Front Desk Supervisor.  \nRemaining management: GM, AGM, FOM  \n\n\n\\-----\n\nThis next one is much less of a tale. We've known since before the new year that the AGM was looking at moving to a different property to take over as GM, and she apparently managed to get that opportunity right after the above story. She turns in her two weeks, leaves on good terms, everything is okay. She was the woman who hired me, she was very...direct sometimes, but she genuinely cared once she came to understand that you *also* cared.\n\nUnfortunate timing, but sometimes that just kinda happens.\n\n\\-1 Assistant General Manager.  \nRemaining management: GM, FOM\n\n\\------\n\nAnd then we come to tonight. Or I guess technically last night. We're in the midst of an ice storm, and the roads really aren't safe to drive on. For a bit of perspective, our FOM is a tremendous piece of shit and nobody likes him. He's the sort of guy who will never cover for any shifts, will always schedule his time off so that he doesn't have to deal with the big groups, always makes schedules wrong, and so on. He was brought onto that position by the previous GM, who is now gone.\n\nFDA is unable to make it in, because the roads are just an absolute mess. (This is understandable.) One of our maintenance guys volunteers to go pick him up! This prince of a fellow not only goes and gets FDA, but takes him home at the end of his shift. (Also, for those of you who have been reading, this is the same FDA from the first story.)\n\nWhat I didn't find out till later was that when FDA was brought to the hotel, FOM ***fucking bailed.*** It wasn't even the end of his shift - he was scheduled from 6a until 2p - but he decided that he just didn't need to be there anymore, and took off without any warning. If my co-workers are to be believed - and the GM's demeanor suggests that this is correct - then the FOM no longer works here. (Good riddance to bad rubbish.)\n\n\\-1 Front Office Manager.  \nRemaining management: GM\n\n\\-----\n\nI've applied for the AGM position, with the understanding that I'd be willing to take FOM or Supervisor if GM thinks I'm not ready for the AGM role yet. (I am, but I don't know if she realizes it). But...yeah.

In the thick of winter, there was no more need for ties, shiny shoes, or freshly pressed shirts. It was the same outfit we've been wearing all week, picked up from the chair by the bed, sprayed with cologne or a little bit of perfume and pulled over our un-showered bodies. These were dark days indeed.\n\nThe shift we're replacing gives us a quick nod, nothing to report and eager to leave before the next snowfall drops. Once they are gone, the routine slips in. A few emails to answer, a few reports and we're done. It's been 45 minutes and we are already finished our work for the evening. For this NA, there are no guests tonight. The resort is empty. All that can be heard is the wind whistling through the crack in the lobby entrance doors and the elevator music that pipes through the vacuous lobby and echoes down the hallways to the empty rooms. Or, are they empty?\n\nThe sound of a door opening on the lower floor shocks me from my internet-surfing slumber. It takes a moment to realize - there is no one staying in the resort. Who just came through those doors? I get up, tip-toe to the stairs, not wanting to give away my presence to the intruder. I hear them walk from the bottom floor to the 2nd. I am on the 3rd. Are they coming here? Should I grab a weapon? Am I over-reacting? The front doors to the lobby behind me shudder with a gust of wind. I spin around, but there is no one there. Just me and whatever is downstairs.\n\nThe footsteps stop on the 2nd floor. Whoever it is isn't coming to the lobby. They must have gone down the hallway to the rooms we are renovating on that floor. I creep down the stairs, fear creeping up my spine. It's my job right? I'm here to protect this place, right? I reach the 2nd floor in time to hear a sound down the hallway. It's one of the room doors being opened. I enter the darkness of the hallway to investigate.\n\nThe lights are off in the hallway to save on the power bill while the rooms get re-carpeted during the day. Tools are strewn about and I step gently over them, so as to not make a sound. I approach room 205 where the intruder is located. I reach the door and it's propped open with a doorstop. There is someone, or something in the room. I can see a shadow in the backdrop moonlight, looking out the window at the ocean below us.\n\nI creep in behind them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Hey! Who are you and what are you doing in this room!\" I scream with a squeak like I'd just reverted to puberty.\n\nThe shadow leaps in the air at the sound of my voice, spins around and then comes crashing down on the bed. I jump to a light switch and turn off the darkness. There he is, twisting on the bed, holding his now-sprained ankle. It's our maintenance manager.\n\n\"What the F\\*\\*\\*!\" He screams. \"I'm just getting my cell phone. I dropped it here this afternoon! You scared the sh\\*\\* out of me!\"\n\nI apologize and go back to my desk, ashamed and proud of myself at the same time. As I walked through the hallway of death, I feared no evil.

So let me tell you what happened. \n\nFor context, there\u2019s a side of the hotel we keep locked at all times. We\u2019re a downtown hotel and this entrance leads directly to the street. To cut back on weirdos waltzing in, the door stays locked. \n\nThis guest (a high tier member of our rewards program \ud83d\ude44) walked up to the door and was seemingly confused as to why the door didn\u2019t immediately open and roll out a red carpet for him.

Once the milk lady is gone, I bring my body around the desk to go open the door for Mr. High Tier. \n\nI will say\u2026 I was nervous to let him in. Not because I thought he\u2019d be pissed about waiting an extra minute and 30 seconds, but because it was pitch black outside and this man had perfectly round eyes that did not blink. I didn\u2019t know what I was about to let into the hotel. \n\nThe doors slide open and I greet him, \u201cHi, how can I help you?\u201d\n\nHis eyebrows furrowed, but his eyes stayed round. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m here to check in?

Guest accused me of perjury when discovering this online and is threatening to sue me and our GM for \u201cbillions\u201d, etc etc. She also started saying that someone outside was stalking her \u2014 it was literally my coworkers relative that picks them up and is only there for 5 minutes at a time twice a day. Delusional stuff.\n\nWell the purpose of the affidavit was for a summary judgement that would fast track the eviction. The summary judgement was granted last week! Though her story is that the bacteria all over the room we \u201cforce\u201d her to stay in was causing such detrimental health issues that doctors told her she HAD to leave. There\u2019s no mold obviously. Her room is fine \u2014 even better now that she\u2019s gone!\n\nThe exit was anti climactic but sweet nonetheless. She used all our luggage carts, told me I was going to hell, and asked me to keep track of her stuff while she waited for her ride lol. I was happy to help her out the door. She didn\u2019t make a huge scene at her departure, so at least she has her dignity? As long as we forget every other day of her stay. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what the deal with the jury trial is now. She can\u2019t come back because we won\u2019t rent to her. She doesn\u2019t have a room. She left of her \u201cown volition,\u201d according to her, and the whole thing didn\u2019t even require a police escort. As far as I know she also hasn\u2019t been charged for her room since September. I don\u2019t know what is happening there, either, but the hotel I\u2019m at isn\u2019t struggling and no one even cares about the money. We\u2019re just happy she\u2019s gone.\n\nTLDR; we got rid of her!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675133648.0},{"title":"Why argue when you know what I need is required?","author":"Flame_Queen69","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10pm9mt\/why_argue_when_you_know_what_i_need_is_required\/","text":"Thank god it\u2019s my Friday.

She asked for a quiet area so we put her away from the elevators and ice machines and for the first 4 or 5 days or so there have been no issues. I checked in a couple with 2 kids into a double queen room a few nights ago and that's when everything started.\n\nIm working audit and when I arrived yesterday the evening clerk advised me the lady next to the people I checked in was complaining about noise all night. As in \"do you have a day care center next to my room?\" I've gotten calls like that before during my years in this job and the one I remember is some grumpy guy who called me and began the conversation with \"why are there elephants moving furniture above my room?\" Like erm ... OK. \n\nI roll my eyes and start my shift expecting a call from that room which is what happened. She called around midnight and complained about noisy children. I said OK I will look into it and she scoffed and said \"sure\" with that tone you can imagine. I head up to the room in question and I hear nothing. I made a point of stomping a bit outside of the woman's room because I'm sure she is listening to make sure I actually came to the area.\n\nShe called back 30 mins or so later and said the kids are still making a ruckus and I said I checked earlier and I heard no noise from that room could it be a different room? \\*mouth drops open\\* No ... its \"that\" room. Ok so I say I'll look into again and same thing I go there and stomp around a bit and hear no noise at all from the room in question.\n\nI didn't get a call back for awhile so I figured that was the end of that, which it was not. She called back and said she can't sleep because she can smell food being cooked through the adjoining door (there is no adjoining door in that room). I tell her we don't allow food being cooked in rooms and she said well they are it smells like tamales. Same routine I'll go check it out, some stomping, no noise no food being cooked in the room. This time she asked me to call her back which I did.\n\nI said I hear no noise and smell no food being cooked from that room and she asks me what I'm going to do about it. I offer her a room move, and upgrade actually, at no additional cost and she begrudgingly accepted that. Or so I thought. A few minutes later she calls and says she's offended that she has to move and the other people don't. I tried upselling the room its an upgrade no charge etc. but that got her more agitated. \n\nShe informed me she was \"considering\" staying another week and if I didn't move the family in question she would go to another hotel. I've done what I could so I tell her I won't ask the other party to move to a different room and I'll log her concerns for the day managers.

But I can have a look in the system and see what I can do.\"\n\nAfter a while, the DM found another suite for TLSPOC. Note that none of our suites has blue theme colour. That suite is also located near a nightclub so it would be noisy during the night. All of this was informed to TLSPOC by the DM. TLSPOC accepted the room and did not care about the noise. TLSPOC said, \"Well it will be fun in the nighttime anyway!\"\n\nThe day after...\n\nTLSPOC's husband: \"Do you have any bigger bathrobe?\"\n\nGSA: \"Unfortunately, we only have one bathrobe size in the hotel.\"\n\nTLSPOC's husband: \"Oh okay, no worries.\"\n\n\\*10 minutes later\\*\n\nTLSPOC: \"Do you have any bigger bathrobe?

Last weekend, during the crisis, every staff in the hotel was very busy, stressed out because of the work and worried that they could be stuck in the hotel due to the flooding around the city. Constant phone calls to book a room, cancellations, leakage in some of the rooms, etc. Yet TLSPOC still somehow found it appropriate to bother the staff.\n\nToday she sent a complaint to our email. I will quote some lines:\n\n\"... While the hotel is not responsible for the noise, I have requested to have a room away from the loud music...\" - Okey TLSPOC, we did put you in a room on the quiet side but you refused to stay, and also you were informed about the noise when you move to that room.\n\n\"...Additionally, when I requested a robe for my husband, we were informed that \"there is one size robe\". This is so insulting...\" - Why? because he was too fat?\n\n\"...All of this could have been different with a welcoming smile or a little kindness, but everyone was so rude. I am very sorry that Auckland has been through a terrible crisis. It is clear that everyone was stressed and we felt it as well...\" - Maybe because she read the news the day after the flooding that someone has died. But proceeding to say \"it was not my fault\" in the beginning was more than a \"fuck you I don't care\" to the staff face. TLSPOC clearly did not show any empathy to anyone who works in the hotel, even knowing we were \"stressed\" the fuck out that night, and still come down with a ridiculous demand.\n\nI was just too tired after that weekend. And not just this TLSPOC, there are more than two of them staying at the same time and we hate all of them!

Partly because I went on vacation for a couple weeks and partly because I haven't had anything really worth sharing lately.\n\nBuuuut tonight's story is brought to you by people who don't know how to order food delivery correctly.\n\nSo it's somewhat past midnight ~~and I'm just trying to debate the benefits of 120 Hz screens for rhythm games~~ when I see some Doordash driver drop off a bag of fast food in front of the front desk's front door and take a picture. \n\nFor reference our front desk \/ lobby isn't particularly big; it's a motel front desk so it's in its own suite in an outdoor hallway and a suite the size of a small bedroom at that. \n\nIrritated that this driver just completely ignored the person through the windows who was very much alive and working, I step out and tell the driver he can't do that. This is a business address, not a residential one, deliveries are supposed to go to whoever is on duty at the front desk. He just hands me the bag and is about to take off.\n\nI look at the receipt on the bag. There's only the customer's first name and last initial, and no room\/suite number. I pull up our system to see if there's a guest with this name...nope. My guess is that it's someone who's staying in a room under someone else's name.\n\nI step out and signal the driver who's about to leave. I try to explain that there's no guest registered by that name, but he doesn't accept it and just says \"500\", likely referring to the motel's address. But our motel's address is 600, he's off by 100.\n\nWhen I looked up the address on Google Maps, I got...another business address. And it's an industrial-type business, not the kind that also runs 24 hours a day. \n\nSo maybe he punched in the wrong address on his navigation app, or he is at the right place and he rattled off the wrong number.\n\nAssuming that the order *was* meant for someone at the hotel, I feel like both the customer and the driver are at fault here. The customer for not specifying the room number, likely under the assumption that their name is on the booking but they are actually staying with someone else who is the actualy registered guest or thinking the driver and I will magically figure out where they are. And the driver too, for not attempting to communicate with the customer; he should've noticed that the address was a hotel as opposed to a house -- I mean shit...we *have* a light-up sign with the property name on it -- and then tried to confirm with the customer whether to deliver it straight to their room or leave it with us for the customer to pick up.\n\nOf course I'm not sure how exactly DoorDash protocol works since I've never worked for them. But when I was working for a same-day merchandise delivery company, we never simply dropped off at business addresses and left without speaking to a human associated with the address; \"drop off no-contact\" was only allowed for residential addresses, and even then some retailers or types of deliveries forbade that approach (groceries for example, and for good reason - you don't want stuff spoiling from being left out in the sun!), requiring us to get a signature from the customer or someone picking up on behalf of them. If for some reason the business address is inaccessible, due to being closed and locked up for example, protocol was to report it in our work app and return the item, not just drop it off and assume it'll safely end up in the intended recipient's hands.\n\nSo if you're staying in a hotel and you order food, **please PLEASE put down your room number**. Otherwise, you're likely paying all those extra delivery fees for nothing. Especially if it's not you who checked in for the room personally.\n\nAnd if you're a driver...make sure you have the correct address, and at least open the damn door of the front desk and speak with whoever's on duty, don't fucking drop it off in front of the front door like this is a house, at least drop it off in front of the guest's room door. Not for nothing are (most) hotels open 24 hours a day. \n\nAs of this writing it's been almost three hours and nobody's claimed the food. Think I'll enjoy a nice borger and fries.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674992819.0},{"title":"Thoughts?

Over the last 2 years, I've worked in a few different hotels in a college town that has a large college football following. Here are my stories.   \n\n\nMy first hotel position was as a night auditor at a motel right on the highway. I've got two stories from this property.   \n\n\nFirst up is the time I offered to call an ambulance for a person and they declined. I got a call\/noise complaint shortly after running the audit (so around 2:30 am) and went down to the room to see what was going on. A long term guest on the property was trying to kick out a man (boyfriend\/hookup\/IDK). I could see the light from their door across the property, and I could hear the shouting as soon as I stepped out of the office building. When I get down there, I can tell the man is wearing a white shirt. He turns around to speak to me slurring his words and standing unsteadily, and I notice that the front of his shirt is completely reddened from blood. He's bleeding from the neck. I offer to call him an ambulance, and he just shrugged nonchalantly and waved me off. At that point, the woman asked me to remove him, and so I told him he had to leave the property. He just calmly waved me off and walked off into the woods behind the hotel. \n\nThe second story from this property is why I ended up leaving it. Luckily, I wasn't actually working the night that this happened, but I got the full story when I came in the next night. Upon arriving for my audit shift, I noticed that one of the rooms was entirely boarded up as the entire front windows and wall had been shattered. My coworker informed me that, the previous night, someone had driven their truck through the front wall of the room, beat a man into unconsciousness, and abducted a woman at gunpoint. I put in my 2 weeks the next morning, and got hired on a larger, nicer hotel across town.   \n\n\nSo this next property was a proper hotel. 4 floors, right near campus, serving mostly families, students, and employees of the university. We even hosted ESPN regularly. I have a few stories from this place.   \n\n\nFirst up: The time a man told me his room was possessed by Satan. \n\nThat night, I was training a new employee (actually my roommate that I had gotten hired to cover my nights off, management was cool with it) on night audit. On the way there, the 2nd shift employee calls me, asking how far away I am. I told her I'd be there shortly, and she explained that she was hiding in the bathroom because a guest was making her extremely uncomfortable. I told her to just stay there until I got there. \n\nWhen I got to the hotel, I clocked in immediately, and the issues immediately started. While the 2nd shift employee was explaining what was going on, the front desk phone rings. It's the guest in question. He asks me to come up to his room to talk about an issue. I guess he was expecting the female front desk employee, because he seemed a little shocked when I showed up. He recovered quickly, and started telling me that he felt like his room was possessed by Satan. He said he could hear the electricity in the walls whispering to him, and that the generic artwork on the wall above the bed seemed to be some form of devil worship. I assured him that the room was not possessed and that the room was safe, and he simply nodded and wished me a good night. By the time I got back to the desk, the phone was already ringing again, and my trainee was on the phone with him. He wanted me to come back up there. It was a repeat of the first time I went up there. This happened roughly 30 times between 11pm and 3 am.   \n\n\nThe second story is shorter and humorous: The hotel was pet friendly, and the university nearby also had a large veterinary college that offered discounted or even free services for special cases if the university was allowed to study them.   \n\n\nA woman called me around 3am (she said she was from the west coast) and asked if we were pet friendly. I explained that yes, we were, and explained our pet policy and fees. She agreed to all of it, and I was preparing to make her reservation when she asked if the pet policy included horses. Horses. Part of me wanted to tell her that if she could fit her horse into the elevator that she was more than welcome, and it took everything in me not to laugh. I told her that no, we didn't accept horses, and recommended she check with local stables to see if they could house her horse during her stay. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last property I worked at that had a crazy story at it was a very new property. It was business oriented, and designed to be a very casual-service hotel. No hot breakfast, etc.   \n\n\nThe night before this story, I had turned away a woman for not having a card to pay with, as well as just seeming generally shady and likely to cause issues for the hotel, as she had stated that she had bounced between 4 hotels that night, getting refunds from each one after calling the cops on them. Anyway, when I show up for that audit shift, I see the 2nd shift guy handing her room keys. I knew then that it was going to be a long night, and sure enough, it was. She was paranoid to the extreme. She called the cops to the hotel 3 times, and of course the front desk alarms let me know when the room phones dial 911. Each time, she would call me immediately after and tell me not to tell the cops what room she was in, but to have them walk the property because there was a billionaire hunting her down. She told me that in the past, the billionaire had poisoned the water supply of other hotels, put noxious gas in the AC systems, and even had \"heat seeking bullets\" that they fired at her. Every single time a guest pulled up to the hotel, or someone drove down the road in front of the hotel, or a door closed on her floor, she was calling me to check the cameras and to walk up to her floor. Eventually, I told her that if she called the cops again, I'd have her escorted off the property. She finally calmed down and went to sleep.   \n\n\nLuckily, I haven't had any more insane experiences since this, but I'm sure I will again soon.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674926866.0},{"title":"Maybe...just maybe...DONT DO THE NONCANCELLABLE RATE IF THE EVENT IS IN THE AIR","author":"PleasantPhysics7982","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10n29w7\/maybejust_maybedont_do_the_noncancellable_rate_if\/","text":"This is currently happening in real time. \n\nSo I'm working my shift, things moving slowly, and I get a call, \"hey my kids event at the university in town got cancelled and I was wondering about cancelling and getting my money back\" I look at the reservation, they paid with our advanced savers rate which we take a deposit for a week out and you can't cancel and can't get the first night's deposit back, the rest of the stay may be refunded (we'll only if you book multiple nights, if you booked 1 night the deposit covered the night and can't be refunded). \n\nAnyways, this week has been shit for me, so I said yeah let me transfer you to cancellations because I just couldn't be yelled at right now.\n\nThen another call comes through, same story, I do the same. He calls back saying he doesn't want \"enter several racist remarks about the overseas customer service representatives\" i said fuck it in my head and said \"it looks like you booked our advanced savers rate, you do save a couple of dollars but the offset is that you have to put down the nights deposit a week before and it's non refundable, if you booked our normal standard rate I could have done something, but it's just agreement with the rate.\" And he's like \"so you're saying...because of an event that's entirely not our fault...you won't refund me the money I used to book the reservation...do you know I travel with yall all the time...\" I looked  at the profile, no points. No points and no past stays...hmmmm idk about that. I said unfortunately our most loyal guests also have to follow the policies put in place. He goes \"I won't stay with you all ever again\" to which I said \"you have every right to make that decision\".\n\nI prayed to god he was the only one who went like that...no 3 calls later...one suprisingly said \"I figured not but worth a shot, not your fault\" and I felt kinda good.

I've heard about this scam before so I knew from the start what the scammer was trying to pull. \n\nThe guest books via a third-party booking website and calls and asks if we can hold his package that he's receiving. We say that's fine as it's pretty common. Then he emails us a shipping label from UPS. I assume he just wants us to print it for him as he may not have access to a printer, nothing unusual so far. Then we get a call at about 8 pm on is check-in day and he says he has tested positive for Covid and cannot make it so if we could print the label for him and ship his package. Also, there's two more packages belonging to his colleague that he'd like us to ship for him. His colleague does not have a reservation with us. \n\nAt this point, I'm pretty sure this is the scam I've heard about. Plus he speaks with a foreign accent, I'd guess some country in Africa so it all sounds pretty suspicious. I let him know we cannot forward his packages and he has two options, we can return them to sender or he has to check in as a guest and pick them up in person. We get off the phone and I try to pre-auth his card as I suspected it is a bogus booking made just to run his little scam and I'm correct, his card is declined. He even arranged a UPS pick-up for them the next morning but the staff had been notified to not hand them over to anybody as I will arrange for them to be sent back to where they came from. I gotta say it felt pretty good to foil his plan, although I'm sure it's not gonna stop them from running it somewhere else. Also thank you to this subreddit as this is where I learned about this scam, had I not known, I probably would've fell for it.\n\nThe second scam is where they were targeting the business itself. So I get a call on a Friday evening saying that our utility bill has not been paid and the shut-off crew is on its way to shut off power. I ask the lady to hold as I go and verify what she's saying. The bill's been paid and we have a receipt (we pay our bill at the local utility office in person). So I tell her she's wrong but she says there's an issue with processing our payment so unless I take care of it now with her, the shut-off crew will disconnect our power within the hour. Then I let her know I will visit the office the following Monday when they open and take care of it. She says they need the payment right now and I need to go to the nearby gas station and wire them the funds or they will shut off our power. At this point, I'm pretty sure this is a scam. So I ask her what my account number is, she pretends to look it up and rambles off some random number which does not match what I have, not even the correct number of digits. So I let her know to send the shut-off crew, I'll be here waiting for them. Also I let her know how pathetic of an attempt this was and to get a real job, she hangs up the phone.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674629454.0},{"title":"Freeloader at the foyer","author":"Delicious_Ad_2070","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10kw6lc\/freeloader_at_the_foyer\/","text":"This is a short one just supposed to make you laugh.\n\nI just got at work 1h ago, 7am, to take the shift from NA so she can go home.\n\nShe said a guest literally came back in last night, laid down (not sit, LAID) on the couch with their legs up on the couch arm and, even getting cross looks from their workmates AND NA, they stayed in that position for about half an hour before they all went up to their rooms.\n\nDear guests, we understand you're tired, specially if you traveled for business, but do remember: you're supposed to feel at home in your room, and remember you aren't home when you're outside.

If you read all the signs, you as a logical human will understand that its only street parking from 3am-7am. Otherwise it's part of the hotel's drive or a loading area.\n\nSo last weekend around 6pm, a car pulls up as I am checking in a guest's vehicle. Two women get out and I greet them. They ask if they can park there, and I ask if they are guests at the hotel. They say no, they are going to dinner at the restaurant down the block. I tell them no, that is for the hotel only. They start arguing with me that they are fine to park there cuz the signs say so. I politely tell them that no, the signs say its a loading zone and part of the hotel drive, so they need to move their vehicle or they COULD be towed. I in no way threatened them with towing. They again point at the bottom sign that has the word metered parking on it and say they can. I reiterate that that is 3am-7am, and right now it is hotel parking. I then point them to an open metered parking space literally across the street and closer to the restaurant, telling them that they can park there. They are grouchy but begrudgingly move their car and go to the restaurant. You all know that this cant be the end of the story, and you care correct,\n\nAbout 20 minutes later a man comes in already irate and demands to know who told the women they couldn't park in the metered parking. I explain everything above again to him. He asks who do I think I am telling them that they can't park there. I am the valet of the hotel (as I am sitting behind the valet desk wearing the uniform). He starts yelling that they can park there and the sign says so. I reply that no, again it does not say that and they are actually in a parking spot closer to the restaurant. He yells at me to come outside so he can show me on the sign where it says they can. I know he wants me outside so he can start a fight so I tell him no, I am not going outside and that the area is hotel loading only. He screams some more, so I tell him that I am an adult, not a child, and he needs to stop speaking to me this way. He responds that he can speak however the F\\*\\*K he wants to and I say he needs to leave now, because our conversation is done. He loses it swearing and calling me names so I call out to the FD to call the police if he doesnt leave the property. He starts storming out irate. I, being the infinite smartass I am, just yell \"Have a great evening sir!\" with a smile, to get a \"F\\*\\*K YOU!\" in reply. We all have a laugh because seriously, how hard is it to read a sign?","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674382607.0},{"title":"TIL apparently it's part of my job duties to keep random people's kids entertained.","author":"shrek_online","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10i9rwb\/til_apparently_its_part_of_my_job_duties_to_keep\/","text":"I work at a hotel within a big cluster of hotels. This weekend there's a basketball tournament in town. Hooray!!!\n\n It has been smooth at my hotel. Just a bunch of nice families here to do the sports thing. My shift ends in an hour and just as I was reflecting on how calm everything has been, things begin to unravel. \n\nA FD associate from the hotel next door to us (our sister property) walks in. He is sweating profusely, his hands are shaking, his voice is cracking. He wants to borrow some bars of soap. Sure thing! I give him a box. A woman walks in behind him (we will call her Jen) and I can practically see the steam coming off her head. She's furious about something. Karen energy is radiating off her. Whatever, I greet her anyway. She snaps back at me \"I'm not here for you I just wanted to see what he was going to say\". She had followed him over here berating him. Felt bad for the guy.\n\nI'm like ....Ok. Rude. Moving on.\n\nThis is where I should mention we have a basketball court on our hotel's property. It is clearly marked that it belongs to our property but unfortunately it doesn't require key card access so anyone could use it. It's closed right now because one of the backboards is shattered and there is broken glass everywhere. Also the entire court is like triple wrapped in caution tape. There is caution tape and traffic cones blocking the entrances. On the cones there are signs that say the court is closed. \n\nAbout 30 minutes ago my houseman notices kids on this busted ass court. WTF!! He tells them to leave and they do. They did not have an adult with them. They are not even guests of this hotel. \n\nMoments later... Jen comes storming into my lobby. She's screaming at me, swearing at me asking me how do I expect her teenagers to stay entertained when I can't provide amenities for them. The kids using the busted, clearly closed court were HER kids. Of course. \n\nI basically communicate to her that she is fucking insane. Like... the court is so obviously closed. It's also obviously dangerous, as evidenced by the broken glass. She isn't even a guest of my hotel and I am not responsible for ensuring her children enjoy their stay. The whole time I'm speaking calmly and she's screaming and swearing. Eventually we start going in circles and she's still making a scene and I've had enough so I invite her to leave and she does. I'm not sure what happened when she went back to her hotel but as I was writing this I saw 3 cop cars pull in the parking lot and go to the hotel next door. Perhaps it's a coincidence. Perhaps not. \n\nNow I'm just reflecting. It's soothing to type this out. \n\nLike, WHY do you want your kids to play on a basketball court covered in broken glass? WHY is that something you're willing to fight for? WHY ARE YOU INSANE?","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674357846.0},{"title":"Reading is hard, I guess?","author":"Tragodile","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10ibqf1\/reading_is_hard_i_guess\/","text":"Had a couple come up to out desk this morning not five minutes before I left for work.

I had to explain to them that it would take up to 2-5 business days to return, so most likely on Monday and at the latest Wednesday from them checking out.\n\nThey were not happy with this.

The website mentions the deposit along with a sign that was literally right in front of us both right as we argued as well.

This is OP, how could I assist you today?\n\n\nHP: Hi, I have my son coming down to your hotel for a hockey tournament. He's a Senior in high school, and I fear that people will be mean and cruel to my son when he's there. I was wondering how your breakfast situation is since he'll be by himself.\n\n\nOP: Well, we have two options for breakfast: one is a Starbucks that has the full menu of sandwiches, pastries, coffees, and teas you'd find in any Starbucks around the world.

It's time for another tale from the front desk. Here's a bit of background: I work at the front desk of an upscale chain hotel no more than five miles from an international airport. Guess how many full-service hotels close to this airport give complimentary parking?\n\n\nGive up? The answer, of course, is zero. Too bad tonight's subject didn't get the memo.\n\n\nIt's a quiet Saturday afternoon. We don't have that many check-ins to get through, as our hotel caters more to business travel than leisure. In comes Mr. Free Parking (FP, for short) with his significant other, Miss Information. I start to check them in by asking for an ID and credit card, telling them the room rate they booked includes daily breakfast, and asking how many keys they need. FP then asks...\n\n\nFP: I saw somewhere that parking is free during my stay, is that right?\n\n\nNaturally, I double-checked the rate to confirm whether or not parking was included in their special rate. I saw that the rate only included breakfast with the room, but not parking.\n\n\nOP: Unfortunately, your rate only includes breakfast, but no parking. Self parking is at $18 a night, and valet will-\n\n\nFP: Look, I've already had problems when calling (chain) customer service to book; the lady on the phone gave me the run-around and tried to sucker me out of more money than I was willing to spend. Now you're saying I gotta pay to park my own damn car? I drove too far to be paying for parking here. Is there anything you can do for me?\n\n\nOP: I'll go ahead and see what I can do for you.\n\n\nI then called up the manager on duty to relay this info, who said the parking charge would still stand. I told this to FP and Miss Information, and they still weren't having it. They wanted to talk to the manager in person, so I called him out to the desk.\n\n\nFP then parroted the same complaints about the parking fee and the customer service representative. The manager then opted to comp parking for FP as a one-time courtesy.\n\n\nSometimes, true believers, you have to choose your battles carefully. There are times when it's justified to stand your ground on policies, but this was not one of those times for the manager. Did I agree with the decision? No. But you have to understand that in the world of chain hotels, you have to do practically anything to make the guest happy.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674353723.0},{"title":"Elderly people in hotels","author":"Lilyblue1979","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10ht7xy\/elderly_people_in_hotels\/","text":"So, I am a front Desk Agent at a small Extended stay Franchise run hotel.

He can't even pull up his own goddamn reports. \n\nWhat's more, he's needlessly confrontational. He's literally asked me to deny a time off request so that the employee \"doesn't get too comfortable.\" Like, what the Hell? Are you \\*trying\\* to drive away employees? And finally his habit of giving me and other managers multiple things that \"need to be done\", not indicating which ones should have priority, then getting upset when they're all not done immediately. He's literally useless and I honestly think things would rum smoother if he wasn't around.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674268771.0},{"title":"My Weirdest Encounter","author":"hcsh224","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10gv1qa\/my_weirdest_encounter\/","text":"This happened to me about a year ago probably but I was reminded of it and wanted to share. \n\nI was working 3rd shift one night (my usual shift) probably around 2am-ish I came out of the kitchen to see someone standing in the office doorway behind the desk. \n\nI call out to him that he can\u2019t be back there and he just goes into the office\/laundry area.

I come from a family of six, and with my mom at his bedside, no food is being cooked. I don't live with my parents and am spending all day at the hospital (I'm NA), so I wished I could do more for them. Well, a man comes in wearing a restaurant outfit and sets this ENORMOUS bag of food on my counter. I smile and ask what the name and room for the order is, and he shakes his head.\n\n\"No, this food is for you.\"\n\nMy mouth drops open. \"I didn't order anything. Are you maybe at the wrong location?\"\n\n\"No, I am staying here. This was an order that didn't get picked up in time. I thought maybe someone here could use it. I also added extra food, like rolls and salad, so it didn't go to waste.\"\n\nI give the man another look-over. He is completely in restaurant attire. It's a really nice restaurant franchise over here, one 's name which begins with the second biggest state in America and is known for roadkill menu jokes. I am so gracious for the food and thank him from the bottom of my heart. He heads up the elevator to his room and I am left with a (no joke) ten pound bag of hot food. I pull everything out and look it over. There are two steaks the size of my face, bags and bags of rolls, two cartons of salad, two huge baked potatoes, ribs, a small steak, fried steak strips, chili, mashed potatoes, sauces galore, you name it. It is easily worth over $100. I try not to cry as I pack it all up again. This is just what my family needed. I'm not anywhere close to religious, but I felt like someone was really watching my family. My dad is up with my brother right now, and I asked if they could use the food. He immediately said yes.\n\nIt's fridge temps right now, so I decided to take the bag of food out to my car. This bag won't fit in either fridge we have, so it's the only option for me. It's currently 33\u00b0F and only two in the morning, so I wasn't too worried about putting it in my dinky Subaru. I heave the bag into my arms and strut on out. I check my surroundings because a bitch ain't about to get kidnapped. Good thing I did, because I saw a man watching me over by the dumpsters. That obviously spooked me, especially since my car was near him, so I noped back inside. I watched from the windows as the guy emerged from the other side of the dumpster and disappeared behind the hotel. Granted, he was minding his own business, but I am a \"better safe than sorry\" kind of gal. I waited twenty minutes, trying to figure out what to do. I didn't want to keep the food out any longer, since I really don't know how long it has been out and food poisoning is the last thing my little brother needs. So I try again. It has been about a half hour this point and I figure no one is in the parking lot.\n\nI look around again, making sure the way is clear. I am the only employee on the property, so if something happens to me, everyone is fucked. I catch movement across the other side of the parking lot and see a figure emerge from some cars, wearing all black. He called out to me, \"hello ma'am, hello ma'am.\" I am waiting on one more arrival, so I greeted him back. The hair stands up on the back of my neck. Wait... why are there no car lights on? *Why doesn't he have luggage? I didn't hear or see a car pull up, and I've been looking out the windows for the last half an hour!* I take a step back. I don't think this is a guest. At the same time I came to that conclusion, he bolts at me. I barely have enough time to spin around, run inside, and lock the doors behind me. I drop the food and run straight into the laundry room, not wanting him to start looking in the windows or try to come in. I ring the police. For all I know, he was in the middle of breaking into cars. Plus, I don't think chasing me is the most outstanding citizen thing to do.\n\nIt's the non-emergency line, but police were there in minutes. A young cop comes in and I explain the situation, and he says he thinks he knows who its is. He turns to leave, and I sheepishly ask him a favor. \"Can you walk me out to my car? All I want to do is put this food in my car.\"\n\nHe laughs and agrees. My car is literally only fifteen feet from the door. I fumble with the lock and place the food under a blanket. He tells me to look up and identify the man that a second officer is talking to. \"Is this the man you saw?\"\n\nI lock eyes with this young man. Not only is he wearing different clothes, he's a different race. I say no, and the police dismiss him. I'm a little bummed that the guy who chased me got away, but the cops aren't done. \"We know who it was.\"\n\nApparently at the same time I called, the hotel across the parking lot called the man in, too. They gave the exact description I did, except they claimed he was a decade or two younger. I have horrible eyesight and I was not in the position to let him get close enough, so maybe he was younger than I reported. But we both described his clothing the same. They reported him for going through their garbage, which is heartbreaking :( if he hadn't literally ran at me, I would have shared some of the night's spoils with him. He probably started at our dumpster, which is where I first saw him, before going over to the other hotel's bin. He may have started trying his luck with cars at that point, which is when I saw him again.\n\nI don't know if police ever caught up with him.\n\nI wish it went a little differently. I'm a survivor of assault, so I don't take any chances with befriending random men alone, especially in the middle of the night. I had the resources to help. I was gifted something wonderful that I plan on taking to my family in our time of need, but he could have used help, too. I feel really shitty about the whole situation, but nothing short of grateful for the guest, who didn't know I was in need, who gifted me the food.\n\nIf there is a God out there, thank you, and watch over that guy tonight.

He was from out of state and got a hotel room in our city. At some point during his visit our office got a call from the hotel. The guy had died in his room. They asked us to come and collect his belongings. He checked in with his company credit card and he listed his address as his work address so they had no way of notifying his family. I think the police were handling contacting his family. Anyway the hotel called and asked us to handle collecting his things. When we got there we assumed they would have his luggage waiting for us. Nope. They led us up to his room and everything was just as he left it. The employee who let us into the room quickly disappeared. There was no evidence of someone dying in there so I guess the guy had a heart attack or something- I never found out. We gathered everything up as fast as possible and got out of there. We did find some drugs and sex toys so I don\u2019t know if maybe that was a reason for them not packing his things up? I know hotels have no issue packing peoples shit up if they think they have overstayed because it\u2019s happened to me. Is there a protocol that gets followed when something like this happens?

This was on Christmas Eve, and I was relaxing in my room when the fire alarm suddenly goes off. I had my cat with me so I grabbed him, put tennis shoes on (with no socks) and we take off down the stairs. I go down to the lobby to talk to my coworker who was running the front desk for the AM.

I put my cat in the bathroom and ran upstairs with our night auditor to see the damage. Sure enough when I got upstairs there was water pouring all over the floor and coming through the ceiling. He and I start banging on the doors of people's rooms and telling them to evacuate. Then the power completely shut off in the hotel and we had to call 911 to get the fire department down to the hotel. \n\nIt took us a good few hours to get everyone out and relocated to different hotels. It was stressful and it was difficult because people were getting angry about getting their things together to move hotels. I was still in my pajamas.

I was MOD, and we had a woman come up to the front desk. She was actually very nice, but distressed - she said her car was hit in the parking lot, but she didn't know by whom. She wanted to know if we have cameras (we didn't) or if we could do anything to help. I knew I at least had to write up an incident report, so I went out to the parking lot with her to see the damage. Now, let's be clear - there sure as fuck was damage. It wasn't a tiny scrape either, or even a superficial dent, it was definitely going to cost her a pretty penny to fix.\n\nBut it was *weird*.\n\nFirst of all, it was on the front end of her car, not the back that was facing the aisle of the parking lot Which would mean that it would have to have been done by someone pulling in to the spot across from her... but that spot was occupied, and the car there didn't have a single ding, or any kind of extra grille that would explain why. It was possible that maybe there had been another car there before this one and another had taken its place since the damage was done... but that wasn't the only weird bit. This wasn't a big wide dent like you normally see when a car hits another. This almost looked like someone had taken a dull axe and swung it at this lady's car. The dent was DEEP, like a few inches deep, but it was super narrow and very localized. I was at a loss for a second.... until I saw a piece of particle board on the ground, right next to her car.\n\nSo, now we need to back up a touch. We were having some construction done on our hotel. And the construction crew that corporate had hired was well... not the greatest. Mostly because the night before, they had not properly secured a lot of their equipment. On the roof. Of a ten story hotel. In Oklahoma. In April.\n\nIf you're not familiar, spring in Oklahoma gets just a touch fucken WIMDY. As in, we're in the middle of Tornado Alley and spring is the prime season for it. And these morons didn't. Secure. Their. Equipment. I know this for a fact, because the night before, when I was ALSO MOD (overscheduling me as MOD was a large reason for my departure from this position), we had a Tornado Warning, and extremely high winds. During which we discovered a huge, metal hook, attached to a rope long enough to reach from the roof of the hotel almost all the way to the ground, had not been secured, and was swinging wildly against the side of the building, as well as through a heavy foot-traffic area. Thankfully, my engineer for the night and I were able to tie it down ourselves before it fucking killed anyone, and I got that down in a report. But I hadn't even considered that it wasn't the only thing those knuckleheads hadn't secured. And now I was looking at a piece of particle board that had almost certainly been blown off the roof by 60-70 mph winds, and had basically karate-chopped this poor lady's car.\n\nAnd I couldn't do sweet FA about it without losing my job.\n\nYou know how corporate is. If it got back to someone that I was the one who pointed out to this woman that the hotel might have some liability here, I'd be up to my neck in it. Especially since I didn't technically have proof other than common fucking sense. I do realize that ultimately it should be the construction crew who should pay for the damages - but again, corporate. Even a whiff of owing money and it'd be my head on the chopping block without a bit of hesitation. \n\nSo I played dumb. I felt like shit about it. This lady really was being as reasonable as can be expected about the whole thing. So I did what I could for her. I offered to take pictures for her of the damage (she was older and didn't really know how to use her camera phone). And I made sure to get the board in every shot. Praying to God that someone who looked at these photos would be able to make the connection. I took her information and gave it to the GM, with my suspicions of what had happened, and strongly hinted that he should do something about it with the construction company. But I have no idea if he actually did.\n\nLady, you're probably not reading this, but I'm so fucking sorry. I really hope that dent got fixed, and preferably paid for by someone who wouldn't miss the money. Because damn, I really wanted to tip you off... but I had to make rent that month.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674093548.0},{"title":"\"No cancel\" reservation screws another guest","author":"Jdawger_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10f90ga\/no_cancel_reservation_screws_another_guest\/","text":"At our hotel, we have a pool. It's not the biggest or the best pool in the area, but it exists. A few months ago, the pool heater broke, so the pool was ice cold because of the winter temps. Our owner ordered a new one back in November within a few days of it not working, but it never arrived. After a few negative reviews about the pool not being heated and the order getting cancelled (with no new heater arriving until Feb. at the earliest), management decided to close the pool & take the time to do other things to it & make sure the other parts are working properly.\n\nLess than a week after we closed the pool for this maintenance, I got a call from someone asking the price of the room. Told them the rate, but they didn't like it and said it was cheaper online. Said that if you can find a cheaper rate online, then book it since I can't honor a rate that you say you found online, but warned them about how those rates have less flexibility and worse cancellation policies. They hung up without saying anything after that.\n\nAbout a few minutes later, I see a new reservation come up from a third party with an infamous \"no cancel\" rate. For those who don't know, the \"no cancel\" rate from third parties is exactly how it sounds: no matter what, you cannot cancel the reservation nor change the dates, regardless of when you booked it. These are some of the cheapest rates you can find, but one of the worst reservations if things change. Bottom line, don't make reservations with this rate unless you know for sure you are going to be there for the dates you put in.\n\nAnyway, about four hours later, a woman shows up with her two kids, saying she is checking in under that \"no cancel\" reservation. I check it and it is registered to two adults and two children (thankfully. I hate when people don't register their kids on 3rd party discount reservations because we would then charge them per ours and the 3rd party's commission partnership, but that is another tale). \n\nAs I am starting to get the registration card printed with our hotel terms on it, the woman asks what time the pool closes. I explain that it is closed because of mechanical issues. She gets surprised, telling me in a kind of angry tone she booked the room so her children can swim before she asks to cancel the reservation so they can go elsewhere. After I tell her that the reservation was a \"non cancel\" reservation and she would not be refunded, she starts getting upset (thankfully not full stereotypical entitled Karen mode because her kids were with her, Karen-like)\n\n\"What do you mean you can't cancel? I haven't checked in yet and your pool isn't working.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, if you booked directly through our hotel, then I could cancel, but I can't without you still being charged as it was through a third party with their specific cancellation rules.\"\n\n\"I called a few hours earlier. Why didn't you tell me the pool wasn't open? I wouldn't have booked otherwise.\" It was a slow night and I only had one phone call, so I knew she was the one who just asked for room rates and wanted us to book it for cheaper than online.\n\n\"I was the one who talked to you and you never asked about the pool, just the rate. We got disconnected after I said if you find a cheaper rate online to book it there, and I didn't have a way to contact you otherwise.\"\n\n\"Well, either open the pool or I'm leaving. I expect a refund if I leave or I'm going to leave a bad review.\" Even if I wanted to at that point, I couldn't open the pool since we drained it the night before.\n\nI just said to her again that she is not getting refunded, so she can either stay the night or go somewhere else and still get charged the night. She left, but not before saying that she will be calling corporate.\n\nSure enough, less than ten minutes later, corporate does call and asks for my side. I tell them that she booked a \"no cancel\" reservation after we couldn't honor a rate she saw on a 3rd party and that's why we aren't refunding her. They asked about the pool situation and told them that it was indeed closed, but the guest didn't ask about it, so I didn't warn her over the phone. The person actually laughed saying if he had a dollar for every time he got a call about an issue that wouldn't be one if the guests asked the hotel in advance, he wouldn't need to work. I laughed back and asked if he needed any more information. He didn't and said he'd tell the guest she isn't getting a refund and they needed to talk to the 3rd party site, not our hotel brand's corporate.\n\nAn hour after we hung up, I got a call from the 3rd party asking about the reservation. Usually 3rd parties kind of ask in a demanding way that we refund the guest (or ask us to refund them), which pisses me off, but this person didn't. He just asked one single normally like he was required to ask and verified that it is a \u201cno cancel\u201d on my end. I confirmed and he was like \"that's what I thought. Thank you.\" and hung up.\n\nI know I'm preaching to the choir with y'all, but book directly. It's the only way to have flexibility and to cancel (even after the hotel's cancellation policy if they make an exception). And especially, if you are staying somewhere because of an amenity, make sure it is open before booking.\n\n\nEdit: \nSorry, I can't respond to everybody about this as I am at work right now, so I'll address the concerns here.\n\nFirst off, for the people asking or wondering if it was updated that the pool was closed on our site, on our direct booking site (aka the hotel brand's site) it was changed right away. As for third party sites and other sites that we don't have direct control on the information, some were changed but others not. We put a request to change the information to as many sites as possible right away. Some did right away, some took a few days to a week to change, and others haven't changed despite our requests. At the time of this post, a lot of major third parties changed the info to \"temporarly closed,\" but there is one or two major ones that hasn't changed yet\n\nSecond off, in relation to the site information again, the lady didn't state where she saw that the pool was open or if we had the pool to begin with (if she did see it on a site). For all we know, she could've learned about the pool some other way besides a site, like word of mouth, assumptions, a previous stay, or maybe she saw it driving down the road. If she said specifically where she learned that there was a pool that was open, then I could've checked said site or whatever, but because she didn't say anything, there isn't much I can do.\n\nThird off, one thing that you are taught as an FDA is to answer questions that the guest asks, especially over the phone. If I said to every single guest that the pool is closed, especially when they are only asking availability or rates, then at least 95% of the time (rough guess) they didn't need said information or don't care. \n\nFourth off, for said reservation and phone call, when the lady asked about the rate, I answered the questions, but she hung up after I said the thing about \"if you find a better rate online, book it since I can't honor it.\" Didn't have time to even remotely mention the pool was closed. And as for possibly calling the guest when the reservation was booked, one thing that I hate from third party sites is when they don't give any information besides name and payment. Her reservation (which I just went back in the logs to check) didn't have a phone number or email, just the name and a virtually credit card that the third party made. I couldn't call a number on the reservation to notify them beforehand.\n\nFinally, for those who don't know how third parties work for cancellation, to cancel to begin with, you need to adhere to both the hotel's cancellation policy and the third party's cancellation policy. The third party cancellation policy is the one that is always different from reservation to reservation since each specific one is different depending on how much of a discount it is (rule of thumb, the cheaper the rate, the steeper the cancellation policy from the third party). The cancellation policy for pretty much any \"no cancel\" is if you cancel for any reason whatsoever, you won't be refunded. When I stated that it is a non-cancelable rate code to the guest, that was based off the rate code the third party gave. Third parties don't care why you cancel, even if an amenity was not available. Even when the third party called, they didn't ask for an authorization for us\/them to refund the guest, just to confirm that said rate code was a \"no cancel\" code on our end.\n\n\nEdit2:\nWhether you think I am in the wrong or the guest, it doesn't matter. I'm not a \"heartless bastard\" (as somebody DM'd me saying). I did feel for them, but there was nothing I could of really done. There was no way of notifying the guest that the pool was down unless I said that in the first second of the call; we got disconnected right after I said to book on the site that has the rate she sees since I can't honor it and I didn't have a contact number from said call nor the reservation itself since 3rd parties have a habit of just giving us the guest's name and payment only. Our direct site says \"temporally closed\" and we put requests on 3rd party sites to get that changed. If the guest sees it still says it's open on any third party site, that is on the third party for not changing it since we did notify all our partnered third parties (aka the only third parties that you can make a reservation at our hotel through besides direct of course). We can't control them changing it besides sending more requests to change.\n\nEdit3:\nI can't believe how much fucking discord is happening in the comments, thus why I'm not reading them anymore after this edit. You can hate me because of this story, I don't care anymore. I don't need to explain every little detail of what happened for your amusement, especially since it seems half of you are trolls or want to stir up shit.\n\nThis post isn't to gloat that \"Hehehe I screwed over a family\" or \"guest is being an [insert word here].\" TalesFronTheFrontDesk, while usually \"guest is bad\" or \"this crazy shit happened\" isn't just that. There are stories that are more cautionary tales, like this one (I think that is the best way to describe this).\n\nBefore I go, let me explain a few more things quickly:\n\nIn terms of what the guest said specifically and her tone (which I can't believe I need to describe), let me pose three ways someone could act when they hear the news that the pool is closed:\n1.) \"Oh really. That sucks. I was hoping to swim with my kids. Is there any way to cancel this reservation?\"\n2.) \"Dammit. I wish this was told to me. Cancel my reservation.\"\n3.) \"This is fucking unacceptable. I demand you cancel my reservation now.\"\nThese are three (kind of extreme stereotypical) ways someone could react to the info. 1 I would work with extremely to see what we can do to potentially cancel or compensate heavily (had a guest a while ago in a similar situation where we ended up giving her a significant discount for her next stay as well as bonus points & $5 in Sundry shop credit during her stay). 2 might just be a free water bottle and\/or a few bonus points if they were a member. 3 would be a \"sorry, you cannot cancel\" and that's basically it. Based off her tone and actual word choices, she was inbetween 2 and 3, but approached 3 the longer we talked.\n\nAlso, yes the 3rd Party just asked me to confirm the rate code. That's it. I am not sugarcoating anything nor hiding anything else they asked\/said (besides the thank you at the end and the confirming that she was a reservation at our hotel).\n\nI don't know much about third party cancellation policies or how they are formed tbh. What I do know is they seemed to be the same in the area as I have stayed in a many hotels around this area (it's a campus area with at least 20 hotels in a 5 mile radius), so I assume (at least by area) that they have the same 3rd party cancellation policy per rate code.\n\nAnd I will state one more time that the info on sites was changed. At the time of the event, I knew it was changed on our official site and one popular third party. Did I specifically check the day or days after the pool went down? No, but I knew both those were changed because I used them at one point between the pool closing and the event. Most sites do have the correct info that the pool is temporarily closed. The only ones that don't are the smaller, company-based ones like a trucking portal or a construction portal (which we totally do not have control over).\n\nFinally, if the title is misleading to how I feel, I apologize. It was a very early morning while at the desk and I couldn't think of a title. I see how negative that sounds or how it can portray that I don't care. If I could change it, I would","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1674052972.0},{"title":"A broken key box, a fight, and a purple takeover","author":"Vilaya","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10emfmf\/a_broken_key_box_a_fight_and_a_purple_takeover\/","text":"In my history of work experience this was the most hectic day on the clock of my life. I remember the times because I kept looking at the clock hoping the next round would be over soon.\n\nIt was a Tuesday. I was on the 7-3 alone with no mid-shift coming in because it was only a Tuesday and it\u2019s a smaller hotel. While leaving my 11-7 the evening before, the only things that stuck out for the next day were that we were having a large group (let\u2019s call them Purple) that took up most of of our event rooms and that the key box was broken. The way our key box works is that it\u2019s locked and you use your employee ID number to open it. You select which key you\u2019re checking out from a list and when the box opens that key will light up. Our engineer was able to pull it open, but none of the keys were labeled, though it wasn\u2019t a huge deal that Monday. \u201cNothing big, just stuff happening earlier in the day than usual because of the event,\u201d I blissfully and naively thought.\n\n7:00 Tuesday morning I arrive and the Night Auditor sighs and asks if I know which of the now unmarked keys is the gate key. We have a gated lock and Sales asked us on Purple\u2019s group resume to open the gate at 7am and close it at 9am. I told the auditor that I was pretty sure which key it was and to just go home because she looked dead on her feet that particular morning. I grab the key from the box and walk all the way over to the gate and it didn\u2019t unlock. Went back to the box, grabbed all of the keys that looked like they could work and tried again, no luck. Some Purple organizers were arriving and I realize the Maintenance key ring probably has a copy of the key on it. Even though I knew I should never touch it, I took the Maintenance key ring outside and bingo, it had the key. Went to the back office, put the key ring back where I found it, went to the desk and one of our restaurant cooks was leaning on it inpatiently.\n\nHe asked if I had the GM\u2019s number. His personal cell is written on the desk so I felt comfortable giving it to the cook. He then asked if there are security cameras in the kitchen. There are. I know because the screens are in the office behind the desk. He told me that the other cook there tried to punch him and the waitress was able to break them up. The gate ordeal took almost twenty minutes, I was irked already because of it, and a fight is definitely above my pay grade so I tell him that the GM and F&B Manager will have to look at the footage when they get in.\n\nThat all took until 7:30 and I now have a small stack of room keys that are ready to be checked out. I try to settle payment for the first reservation. The credit card declined. Same with the second reservation. I had a suspicion about what was going on and tried to settle the third balance just to be sure. My credit card machine was down. I\u2019m checking a trickle of people out with open folios when I see my GM a *lot* earlier than I usually do (stays late and arrives late). I wave him down and he says \u201cLet me guess. Your credit cards aren\u2019t going through.\u201d All the credit card machines were down in the entire hotel and restaurant. The restaurant called him in early because they already figured it out.\n\n8:00. Our hotel\u2019s event rooms end up stretching out down three corridors with our lobby and entrance in the center. Things are getting loud with the nature of that layout holding one event. The two people in Sales who are supervising are running around, but one of the group\u2019s organizers seems to have been doing work with GM because she keeps coming to the front desk to ask for him by name. I have to actually leave the desk to find him because he\u2019s on his phone with the credit machine support and trying each individual POS in the hotel. He put support on hold to talk with this woman about two times before having me direct her to Sales. Had to hunt one of them down. Sales complains because they claim GM was supposed to work with the coordinator (bs) and I more or less tell them to make due because our hotel currently can\u2019t accept money. They didn\u2019t care and I didn\u2019t care about them not caring because they can bully the GM if they want to, not me. (Btw about that. Let\u2019s just say as far as bullying the GM goes, f*ck around and find out.) I just wanted to settle folios before 2:55pm.\n\n9:00 comes around and I see our Chief Engineer staring at the open lock box. He just came in and his key ring is gone. I admitted that I used it earlier but could swear I put it back. I\u2019m looking for it all over the desk and in the back office for it. I told him that I remember putting it back and it\u2019s nowhere to be found in my area. He clearly didn\u2019t believe me, but he said can make do with the other keys and I have my own things to do. I reminded myself that it was the extent I was able to help him and continued with my day.\n\n9:15 and I\u2019m looking for the GM at the coordinator\u2019s request again because Sales was pushing their luck. When I find him I hear a familiar jingle.\n\n\u201c[GM], are those the Maintenance keys?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Engineer] is looking for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? I figured he\u2019d know I have them because who else would grab them?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 He needs to close the gate at 9:00 which was fifteen minutes ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really busy. He\u2019s going to have to get them from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cK. Btw. Coordinator wants to talk with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought [Sales Director] was handling that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot anymore I guess?\u201d\n\n\u201c-Narrows eyes- I\u2019ll speak with them. -jogs off-\u201c\n\nI\u2019m not above throwing Sales Director under the bus at this point.\n\n9:20. I let a very frustrated engineer know where his keys were and continue to check people out with open folios and start on my paperwork two hours later than I usually do.\n\n10:00 and Purple\u2019s event is starting in a half hour. Now, here\u2019s something that Sales should have put on the resume and Purple should have told their attendees. Sales and Purple apparently had an understanding that our gated lot isn\u2019t big enough for both our guests and Purple\u2019s attendees. So there was valet parking from our hotel to a nearby parking garage for Purple. I had no idea. And neither did the literal dozens of people who asked for access to our gated lot. After the second person asked I hunted down someone from Sales to ask where parking was and with their explanation I knew sh*t was about to really, actually, hit the fan today once the attendees really started coming. I was explaining the situation on repeat and I\u2019m pretty sure not a single attendee knew this parking situation was going to happen.\n\n11:00 and checkout time with Purple attendees still asking about parking. That particular day our GM\u2019s master key card deactivated. Our Chief Engineer was the only other MOD who had the ability to make one for him. I love the guy, but he\u2019s a boomer who has little knowledge of computer programs. The poor guy was standing at the front desk trying to make a master key card and I couldn\u2019t help him because I didn\u2019t have access to the program so I was unfamiliar too. That was when Purple\u2019s biggest a-hole came to the desk. Even though I was the one dressed business casual with a name tag and Engineer is dressed like a maintenance guy complete with trucker hat, a-hole kept yelling at Engineer as if he was in charge of the valet parking. He did *not* like the parking situation that was set up. I\u2019ll skip over the accusations and curses, but it ended up with him saying, \u201cSo I can park \u2018anywhere?\u2019 Even the grass?\u201d I smile calmly at him, \u201cYes. Even the grass.\u201d He walks out with a smirk obviously thinking he had the last word and I say to Engineer, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any grass if I remember right, do we?\u201d Engineer looks at the door incredulously and replies \u201cI hope he pops a tire on the curb.\u201d\n\n12:00 and the event is at full swing. I had three old ladies attending Purple come up to the desk to ask if this was an actual hotel you can actually stay at. (No. The five floors and \u201cHotel\u201d in the name are for decoration.) I give them the spiel about room types, amenities, and our boutique aesthetic. I gave them brochures about our brand and turn around to see GM smiling approvingly at me. So I\u2019d done at least one thing right that day.\n\n12:15 and the credit card machines are back up. I\u2019m finally able to process everything. For my hotel that\u2019s the majority of the AM shift duties, so I\u2019m happy to get it done and I was able to do it in bulk, albeit untimely for reasons beyond my control.\n\nIt must have been 1:00-1:15 when I run into the F&B Manager on my way back from the bathroom. \u201cHectic day, huh?\u201d I remark. He gives a long sigh and says \u201cIt\u2019s been something else.\u201d Oops. Forgot about that fight in the kitchen earlier. Found him in the back office looking at the security cameras a bit later. The restaurant is full swing at the moment and probably missing him.\n\n1:30 and some of today\u2019s hotel guests started coming in hoping for an early check in. Housekeeping hadn\u2019t been dealing with Purple and didn\u2019t have a problem identifying the housekeeping keys, so the hotel is almost cleaned for the day. So thankfully I\u2019m able to accommodate the early check ins getting them away from the chaos which is Purple and the general entirety of the hotel. No complaints from any guests, just questions about what was going on because our gorgeous lobby was now Purple\u2019s waiting room for the valet. The event ends at 2:00 so people are finally leaving, but the lobby is hectic.\n\n2:00 and the event is over. Purple\u2019s coordinators are mingling with a few people, but Sales and our single Houseperson for the day are putting everything away trying to wordlessly kick them out. A few more people check in and the lobby is in\u2026 subpar condition to say the least. The GM grabs our Houseperson to clean it and she seems relieved that she\u2019s actually cleaning the hotel instead of cleaning up for Purple.\n\n2:30 and it\u2019s done. It\u2019s over. No one is checking in at the time and I just collapse into a chair. My last half hour is a break on my phone with a latte from the cafe that the barista gave me for free because she had more or less the same day as I did and everyone was taking pity on each other.\n\n3:00. The PM girl comes in to see me slumped in a chair on my phone and asks how the day\u2019s been. I cryptically told her to be happy that she missed everything, did the pass along, and wished her a good night. I drove home blasting music, took a nap, and just read until I was in again Thursday at 7am. It was a much less eventful shift.\n\nFun times.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673987042.0},{"title":"Call Of The Day","author":"literaryguru","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10e1wte\/call_of_the_day\/","text":"It's amazing how many calls I get pretty similar to this one:  \n\n\n  \n\nGuest calling in: \"Hi, It's me, Jen, just calling back about what we spoke about earlier.\" \n\nAwkward pause. \n\nMe: \"I'm sorry Jen, perhaps you can remind me what we were talking about?\" \n\nMe internally: \"You're my 47th call today lady.

From what I was told he came down to the lobby around 1pm and began to cry again and whine and try to get the hotel to do something for him. They didn't and he left.  I thought it was all said and done and he was gone. I was incorrect!\n\nJust after I come on for the NA shift with a total of 1 check in left. The guest arrives to check in. I nice foreign couple who had been assigned room 2703. Now, this room was vacant and clean in my system so of course, I'm going to check them in to a vacant and clean room.  I proceed with the check in process and issue them the keys, wish them a good night and send them on their way. A few minutes later the female comes down and approaches the desk. She actually apologizes to me and says\n\n\"I'm so sorry. There are belongings in that room and the door is open.\"\n\nI apologized and gave them a suite on the same floor and said \"wtf.\" to myself.  I look in the system and see that a woman had been in the room the previous night and thought maybe she had somehow extended her stay.\n\nI created a lock out key and take the elevators up to the 27th floor. I had to be quick because as I was doing this a homeless man attempted to enter my lobby. However I had to lock the guest out.\n\nWhen I get up i see the door is ajar with the long metal flip lock pushed outside. I open the door and walk in. Just inside is a taped up cardboard box with clothing inside. Yes! You heard me right. A taped up cardboard box!! Near the box were what seemed to be 3 larger insulated white zipper bags like one would use for catering purposes.\n\nI was puzzled. Anyway I used the key on the lock and headed back downstairs. I had contacted the previous shift to see if maybe he saw anything and he said that there was a woman with a cardboard box of stuff yesterday but not earlier today. Hmmmm. okay fine. When I asked him about the white bags he said that he never saw the lady with them. Only the cardboard box as she said she was moving.\n\nAll this was right at the beginning of my shift. Roll around to approximately 3am. I am standing over by the coffee area and part of the outside of the front of the hotel is in my view. I happened to look over and I see this guy come into the building.  When I arrived the first thing I did was check to see if he had stayed over as I had been curious. He was checked out of the system at 12:54pm.\n\nHe proceeded to walk back to the elevators. I had my suspicions so I let him do it and ran to the cameras to see where he was going. Sure enough he got off on the 27th floor. turned left off the elevator and about 3\/4 of the way to 2703. (keep in mind we only have 8 rooms per floor so what we see on camera is pretty clear) He stops! Dead in his tracks and hangs his head.\n\nHe goes back to the elevator and gets on. I pop out to the front desk and act as if I know nothing. I hear the doors open on the elevator and glance at my camera at the desk that has the view of the elevator doors.  Off he steps. He approaches the desk and proceeds to tell me that he needs a key for 2703.\n\nPlaying it cool, I asked him his name (even though I already knew it) and I tell him there is no reservation under his name. He then claims how strange that is but that he is in this room because he had checked out from the previous room stored his belongings with the desk and checked in about 1.5 hours later.\n\nOkay. someone could have screwed up. Its entirely possible that someone cancelled his reservation by accident. That the name is spelled incorrectly or any number of things. I do a search and find nothing.\n\nAt this point I have him sit down as I need to call my operations manager and see if maybe our system has done something strange. (this has happened before as the system we are currently using is made for smaller properties not large ones like ours and it has done some insane things.) However, tbh, what I really wanted to call my OM for was to pull up the camera footage starting from around 12:30pm. He immediately does and sees something within minutes of footage.\n\nThe room this guy had previously been in was 1407 which happens to be right next to the service hallway. He had been the only person on 14 the previous night so his room was the only one needed cleaning so the housekeeping staff had not yet come to that floor.\n\nMy OM sees him remove 3 white bags from the room and enter the service hallway. About 30 seconds to a minute later, this guy comes out with no bags.\n\nnext my Om sees him get on the elevator but doesn't come to the lobby. instead he sees this guy get off on the 29th floor (highest floor but no rooms) then go to the stairs and get off on 28. He walks down the hallway looking at room doors. The guy then takes the stairs and gets off on 27 where he sees housekeeping. just outside of 2703. (Normally what i am about to say would not matter, but in this instance it does.) He sees a Spanish speaking housekeeper and he too speaks Spanish. My OM sees a conversation of about 5 minutes. and then this guy goes into room 2703 as the housekeeper enters the service hall on that floor.\n\nMoments later he exited the room, went back down to 14 grabbed the bags from the service hall and went back up the elevator. All of this happened in a matter of minutes.  As my OM is telling me all of this, I am flabbergasted.  How? How did all of this happen?\n\nI exited the back office. I then crossed to the chair directly across where this guy was sitting. I sat down casually. I then began to tell him that we have camera footage of him doing these things and described in detail exactly what was seen. I told him that I had every right to call the police, but If he told me the honest truth, that I wouldn't call them but if I suspected even the smallest lie that I would.\n\nTo my shock he told me a story that I believe to be true.  as he began to cry. For real this time.\n\nHe said that he had planned to stay but couldn't get the money together and because he couldn't do that he was going to go around and see if he could find another room that had been open. He did. He stated that He had made the housekeeper believe that he was already in room 2703 and that he was staying over in that room even though it was as a check out on the housekeeper boards. Once he had convinced housekeeping of that he entered the room and flipped the lock to prop open the door. and then went to get his stuff and took it into the room where he slept for a few hours and then propped the door open again so that when he returned later he could get into the room.\n\nDuring this time I am thinking about where his dog was. What had happened to the dog that was running up and down the hall the night before?? I had asked him about it and he said that he had taken it to his friend's place.\n\nI told the guy that he had to leave the property immediately and if he wanted to retrieve the white bags he would need to come back between 9am and 4pm to do so. That if he were set foot on the property any other time at all that the police would be called. He got up from the lobby sofa and walked out the front door.\n\nI have so many questions. Which I will get answers to on Thursday after I return from my days off.\n\nWhy was this room Vacant and clean in the system?\n\nWhy was this taped up cardboard box full of women's clothing in the room?\n\nWhy did Housekeeping let him into the room if it was a check out?\n\nI guess these are answers for another time.

I figure its going to be a quiet morning so I sit back and turn on HBO max and start watching a movie to pass the time. Then I start to hear a thumping noise. It takes me a moment to realize what it is I'm exhausted and my brains working a little slow. Based on the location of the noise I know what room its coming from I figure they'll be done soon enough it happens from time to time.\n\nI turn back on the movie and zone out for about 45 minutes and realize they're still going at it. Movie finishes and I go to check the coffee supplies for the coffee service I'll need to set up soon and silence so I figure they're done. Then it starts up again. I don't care what people do in the hotel so long as its not illegal but its kinda hard to ignore that when it's so audible.\n\nSo I go to the maintenance room to get some cleaning supplies for the morning cleaning, check and clean the lobby bathrooms and get back to the FD and they're still going strong. OK, not really my business but you know its hard to ignore. There's still about 45 mins or so before coffee service so I sit down and check the cameras\/YouTube so I don't fall asleep. I hear a knock at our lobby window (we're supposed to be at full attention at the FD for our entire shift therefore we don't have lobby bells of any kind--yeah right) and its a couple asking for new sheets.\n\nI ask their room # and its from the noisy room ... so I give them a bag to put their sheets in and run and grab some new ones. When I get back the guy asked to ***extend*** (emphasis on extend) \\*couple giggle to themselves\\* their stay. OK sure weirdos. I do that and ask if they need anything else and the guy said \"yeah ... a SMILE ... ta-da!\" then does a pose like he just did a magic trick. I manage a weak smile and nod in \"appreciation\" and he said \"aww, that's it?\"\n\nI give another weak smile (I don't want to play this game) and say thanks I need to get back to my job and prepare the coffee service and he said \"boo no fun\" and walked off as they giggled some more. I'm tired and annoyed so I vigorously prepare the coffee service making sure everything is perfect, otherwise I'll lose it, and set it out. Then I put on some gloves and carry their bag of sheets like its a bio-hazard to our laundry room before returning to the FD. A short while later the couple walk by looking at me with frowns on their face. I almost flipped them off but I stopped myself.\n\nOne hour left to go and if they started up again I was going to sit in my car until the end of my shift lol. Luckily they didn't so I finished my shift and told my relief what happened and she laughed her ass off. Just a heads up they ***extended*** their stay, etc. I went home plopped down and went straight to sleep.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673928958.0},{"title":"Know where you are having your stuff delivered for God Sake","author":"Jdawger_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10e1u5t\/know_where_you_are_having_your_stuff_delivered\/","text":"Long story short, whenever you order something from delivery services (Doordash, Dominos, etc.), it is always smart to put your room number on the order, even if your instructions are to leave it in the lobby. Why? Because you can avoid two delivery mishaps that happened at my hotel.\n\nThe first one just happened tonight. I'm working afternoon and get a food delivery from one of my favorite burger places in the area. Let's say for sake of story it was supposed to go to a Smith S. Delivery Driver tells me the name and I look it up. Surprise, nobody has the first name Smith. Now, this isn't that uncommon that someone ordered food and they aren't registered to the room (usually a spouse or a visitor), so I check the address. It is indeed our address, but no room number. The delivery driver, not knowing what to do since instructions were to leave it in the lobby, leaves the food and I go on my way doing desk stuff.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I check the bag again and see a phone number. I didn't think anything of it since it was our area code, so I assumed it was the burger place's number. Since I order from them a lot, I realized that the number wasn't right, so I call the number. Sure enough, it was Smith. He was staying at one of the other hotels next to us. I tell him that I have his food, but the driver left and I can't take it over there (since I am the only one at the desk). He said he would walk over.\n\nI felt bad for him because he had to walk in the rain, but at the same time, check your address before you order; it wasn't like the address was like 204 versus 206, our address is a 3 digit number and the other hotel's is a 4 digit one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, at least they got their order. The other one didn't get their order.\n\nLast Thursday, at the beginning of my afternoon shift, I got a delivery of three Walmart bags from some grocery delivery app I haven't heard of. Again, our address with no room number. This time, it had a last name and first initial like \"S. Smith,\" but again, nobody by that last name.\n\nUsually, we'd hold onto it until post-audit if a delivery was made, but it was stuff like a book, sealed mocha, toothpaste, and other non perishables. Since it was on my shift and we had a full-house of high schoolers for some state tournament nearby, I made a staff note to leave it behind the desk until the kids leave (we don't register the kids' names unless we got a room list from the teachers, but we never asked for any).\n\nSure enough, two days later when we went from 100% capacity back down to like 3%, it was still here. We ended up dividing it up amongst ourselves, but I ended up getting most of the items. I felt bad, but at the same time, after 2-3 days of being unclaimed, it was clear that it was a wrong address or abandoned. If we had some sort of way to figure out who it was, then we'd totally try to get it to them (like the burger guy), but alas, we didn't.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673926922.0},{"title":"How I dealt with an angry mother during busy summer hours","author":"rogue1987","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10dqaxi\/how_i_dealt_with_an_angry_mother_during_busy\/","text":"I worked part time at a hotel while studying. The summer was always a pain in the ass as the regular low key business folks was replaced with stressed out families. A lot of the times the moms would make a stink in the reception area. \n\nOur rooms are small but can fit 6 people max, but really tight, almost crammed. \n\nThis one time this mother, the mother of all Karens came with her family of five. She was angry from the moment she walked into the reception. When she finally got her turn to check in(all checkins came at the same time so there was a line) she was annoyed and irritated even though I did my best to welcome them and greet them friendly.\n\nThey got their key and went to their room. Ten minutes later she came back and skipped ahead of the rest of the queue to complain about their room which she said was way too small for five people(even though it had five beds). Her entire family came down. She harassed me for about five minutes even after I politely explained to her that there were no more rooms.\nFinally I caved and said \"look, we're not supposed to do this but if you want I can give you the money for the rooms cash, and you can find another hotel room.\".\nFinally a smile from this bitch. I refunded her with cash from the register and she went on their way. They had not used anything in the room so I marked the room as available.\n\nTen minutes later another family reserved the room. \n\nAbout thirty minutes after Karen left, they came back. She was even more stressed. \n\"There are no hotel rooms available in the entire town! We have no choice but to take your room\" she said. \"Oh, I'm sorry I just sold the room\" I told her. \"But I'd be happy to find you a hotel room in X or Y,(neighboring cities both 40-45 minutes away).\"\n\nThis really set her off. \"We're going to the zoo!(local attraction, very popular), driving 45 minutes each way is going to ruin our entire day!\". \n\n\"I know, you told me. but to be fair, you did have a room here. It's always like this during the summer. All hotels are booked solid.\"\n\n\"So you knew this?\" She was so angry she was almost spitting\n\n\"Yeah, of course there could be cancellations at some hotels. But it is not likely during the summer. But hey, enjoy the zoo and your new hotel!\" I triumphantly said. \n\nShe stomped off, and her husband gave her the angriest look I've ever seen. He looked so pissed at her for complaining. \n\nTL;DR: worked at a hotel, angry mother complained. Gave her cash back and sent her family looking for other rooms even though I knew all hotels were booked and would have to drive a long way to\/from the zoo, effectively ruining their holiday.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673900455.0},{"title":"monday night weirdoes","author":"hikiko_wobbly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10dx7bc\/monday_night_weirdoes\/","text":"Most of our guests are pretty normal, often out of towners in to see a show, or regular old tourists touring around. But tonight I had a series of strange foreign men pass by the desk. I've put them in ascending order of weirdness so read the last one if you don't have time for all.   \n\n\nThere was a youngish, white north american guy who didn't seem to think that computer stores would be closed after 9pm at night, or he thought a convenience store would have his specific computer cable. Maybe he's just used to a city that never sleeps but most places here keep regular 08 - 18ish hours.  He had a strange, very awkward way of speaking, maybe he's just actually autistic, IDK, but he was the least weird of the group. Really he's just getting an honorable mention.    \n\n\nThen there was an african guy who stank of weed. Maybe not so bad that it was offensive but it actually left a trace at reception after he left. This is not so bad in itself and the guy did not appear unfriendly or in any other way difficult. He just didn't have a credit\/debit card with him to put on file. He called his friend who gave their card details over the phone (yes, we do this, not a problem - as long as we can force a payment if they smoke in the room or break something, we'll allow it.). During the call I got the impression it was actually some sort of organisation that was providing this guy with a place to stay for this week, maybe he's a legit refugee of some kind - who knows eh?. Anyway, at some point I had to walk to part of the building where he was staying and could smell a strong smell of weed.  However his room was still down the hallway so... not the strongest case to accuse him on. I notified the night attendant and left it at that.   \n\n\nNext we have a skinny middle aged dude from malaysia. Pretty normal check in, told him how\/ where he can park, check-out time, where breakfast was etc. Then he started asking what there was to do around here at night. I directed him with a map on the desk to a couple of streets with bars\/ pubs, pointed out some of the late-late night ones. Then he asks about 'ladies' and literally for a 'red light district' - I just say sorry I don't know, and I really don't actually. But I guess he - AND HIS WIFE - are intent on a wild one.   \n\n\nNow, here's the real cherry on the cake: an indian\/pakistani who barely speaks english but is probably living here long term (UK btw). He had called earlier and asked the price for a room. I told him 50. He said it was 45 online so I told him to book online. I had to repeat it a few times so he got the message and I think he might have just been expecting me to say I could take 45.   \nHe gets to the hotel, he smells like he works in a pizza kitchen, and says he's paid online. He hasn't, have to print off the confirmation and show him before he agrees to pay at the desk. Then he wants something else but it's incomprehensible, I say sorry I can't understand him a few times. Eventually, I manage to grasp that he wants me to show him where his room is. Not really normal for us, most guests manage to find their room with a little bit of gesturing or instructions in plain english. He's saying 'you're staff, right' and I roll my eyes and say fine, follow me, already thinking about which point to leave him so I'm not caught between him and the door.   \nMission accomplished, I'm safely back at the desk and the phone rings. Yes, my dude is asking about charge points. I tell him we have adapters to lend at reception if he needs it. Bit later, another call, the guests asks if its ok to bring 'ladies' - or at least that's what I understand, maybe he wanted me to send over a 'lady'...? I'm caught a bit off guard, he does have a double room, so technically 2 people could stay there, maybe his wife is joining him...? I stutter a little and then just say no. Then he asks if I can bring water. Drink tap-water, pal, it's very good up here.   \nHis coup de grace however, is coming back to reception, barefoot and in his shorts as he's locked himself out of his room. As I'm bringing the master key to unlock his door for him he says something about massage. What?! I ask. He says something incomprehensible again about massage and points at his legs. I ignore it. I get to his door, open it for him, he says 'thanks, bro' and he puts his hand on my back....   \n\n\nfuckno.jpg   \n\n\nI tell him to \"get away from me, leave me alone\", not so loudly but I think he got the message nonetheless.   \n\n\nI pass on my experiences to the night attendant and we laugh a bit about these weirdoes before I go home. \n\na shudder-inducing shift...","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673914374.0},{"title":"Yes, you need a physical, valid ID! No exceptions!","author":"dmitrineilovich","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10dh3xj\/yes_you_need_a_physical_valid_id_no_exceptions\/","text":"I am not in hospitality, but I lurk in this sub all the time and read stories very similar to what I have to deal with. If this doesn't fit, I will remove it.\n\nThis got long, sorry. TL;DR at the end.\n\nI work as a dispatcher\/clerk for a towing company in a popular NW city. We have a contract with said city to tow vehicles that are improperly parked, have been in an accident, were stopped for DUI, or were stolen. When towed, a vehicle is taken to our lot and stored until the owner comes to get it (or it gets auctioned). It is our responsibility to safeguard the vehicle and its contents until such time as it is redeemed or sold.\n\nOn occasion, a person will decide that the vehicle is not worth paying the impound fee and will abandon it. That's fine, that's what the auction is for. They will often ask to get their property out of the vehicle before writing it off. No problem.\n\nThe law (and our policy) states that whether redeeming the vehicle or getting property out of it, you have to show proof of ownership. We have registration information for most vehicles in our lot, so we know who owns it, whether or not it was recently sold, and to whom (if reported). So we always ask for ID so we're not giving someone's vehicle (or property) to the wrong person. Most times we're given a driver's license; occasionally I'll get a passport, tribal ID, or non-driver's state issued ID. Those all work and 90% of the time there's no issue.\n\nThe other 10% is when someone tries to use just a photo of their ID on their phone. Nuh uh, not happening. It's too easy to photoshop nowadays, and besides, I have to scan the code on the back of the ID.\n\nThere are exceptions I can make in the case that someone's ID has been lost or stolen, and all they have is a photo of the ID. For instance, if they have the temporary replacement ID from the DMV and the photo of their current, valid ID (assuming everything matches) I'll let them use it. Or if they have an expired one in-hand and a photo of their current one (again, assuming everything matches), I'll let them use that too.\n\nLast night the clerk at our other location called me to verify that a photo of the ID on a phone was not sufficient to release property. I confirmed that for him. He told me that the vehicle in question wasn't even at his location, but at mine, and that the customers were told by another employee the day before that the photo of the ID *would* be sufficient. I looked in the notes for the call, and saw that they had spoken to that employee, but she had put no notes in stating that she gave them that information. I reiterated the policy and he told me they were coming to my location. JFC.\n\nThey arrived after an hour, insisting that the clerk they'd just spoken to told them that the photo was sufficient, which I knew to be bullshit. Then they fell back on the previous story that the other employee yesterday said it was ok. I felt this was some kind of scam, but giving them the benefit of the doubt I said \"I'm sorry the other employee gave you incorrect information. I can't accept just a photo of an ID.\" I explained the exceptions that I could make.\n\nThey immediately began screaming at me, calling me a liar, and threatening to call the police. I told them to go right ahead and call the police. I pointed out that a bank would give them the same answer if they tried it there. I was given no explanation for why they had no physical ID. They went out to the parking lot to wait for the police, and after about an hour (this was NOT a priority call) they finally left.\n\nNot more than an hour later, I get a phone call from a different woman asking questions about our next auction, which was later that morning. I answered her questions and then she asked if a photo of her ID was good enough to get a bidder number. I told her that a valid, physical, government issued photo ID was required. She asked if a Costco card would work. \\*sigh\\*  I said no. She hung up the phone and then called right back and said \"What about my DOC ID?\" I was confused. \"DOC?\" \"Department of Corrections\". I said no, that's only valid for the period of time you're actually incarcerated. Hard no. She cussed me out and hung up on me again.\n\nTL;DR Entitled people attempt to use insufficient ID to conduct business and get pissed when told 'no'.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673882272.0},{"title":"Our week of locals and the I told you so night auditor.","author":"birdmanrules","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10dardv\/our_week_of_locals_and_the_i_told_you_so_night\/","text":"Well it goes without saying I hate locals staying. \n\n95 percent chance they are drug dealer's, pimps or escorts.

Unfortunately as they are all locals, they won't until 4,5,6,7 am and probably ask for a super late check out. One already asked for 1pm when check out is 11. Keep in mind  He checked in on Saturday it is now Sunday  shift according to the rules of working in a hotel. Yet, it is also 2:28am Monday morning.\n\nThis guy! Twice on Saturday after he checked in he came to get his key remade. He checked in around 8pm and by the time I left at 9:30 he had already come to the desk to get his key remade twice. As I am walking in the building at 10:40 this evening he is getting his key made again. He must have left at some point because around 1:48am He comes to the desk yet again to get his key remade. While he is at the desk he asks me what he has to do to stay over. I begin to tell him that since we only work online, he will have to make a new reservation online as we do not make them at the desk (This is 100% true as we have no reservations line. WE ARE 100% online only.) He then said that he only has cash.\n\nUpon informing him that we are a cash free property he began to sniffle and tear up. He said he was desperate for a room and then wanted to go buy a prepaid gift card. I pulled up his reservation and noticed that he has a card on file with his name as we do not accept gift cards or cards that do not match the name of the guest. He then asked if I could use the card on file? I said no as it is a brand new 3rd party reservation and our system will not let us transfer cards already on file. We would need it again  (the whole time I am guessing that the card is probably not his). He went and sat down in the lobby and did one of those very loud fake cries trying to gain sympathy. saying he has no where else to go and that he lost his wallet today. Yet, when i see him turn from the desk and walk to the lobby sofa to sit down I see a very thick wallet imprint in his back pocket. When he saw that i wasn't paying him any mind at all whatsoever, he stopped crying, became silent and walked to the elevators.\n\nI had a strange feeling about him so I watch him go to his room on camera. I see him open his room door on the 14th floor and suddenly a dog bolts out and runs down the hallway. I pull up his folio again and look. There is no notes about a dog anywhere. Nor are there any notes in our communications log. Come to think of it, when the front desk agent checked him in, I was standing a few feet away and never saw a dog at that moment either.\n\nI call the guest room. He answers and I ask him if he has a pet in the room. (we are sort of pet friendly as we do allow cats and small dogs under 50Lbs but there is a 75.00 per stay charge) He says he doesn't have a dog at all and I told him that I can show him the camera footage as I had literally just watch the dog bolt from his room and run down the hallway.\n\nSince he was caught and knows that I saw it, he admits that yes, he does have a pet in the room.  I have to double check his folio again and see how he made the reservation as all but one OTA site doesn't state the pet fee but the rest do. Luckily he made his reservation via Crackhead Tonight which states the pet fee. I tell him that I have to charge him this from his incidentals and he begins to suddenly fake cry again and say he has no money other than that. yet he told me prior he has lots of cash. Hmmmm.\n\nIt was at this time that I told him that it was best that he check out in the morning and I was even nice enough to extend his check out by 1 hour.  Even after 13 years at the same hotel in San Francisco and believing locals there were bad, Chicago Locals are 1000x worse.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673859496.0},{"title":"Youth Basketball and BDSM, what could go wrong?","author":"theraoul","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10crbe6\/youth_basketball_and_bdsm_what_could_go_wrong\/","text":"Every year my local youth basketball association goes to a large tournament a state away. All the teams from my town,  4th through 8th grade, boys and girls, A and B (roughly 12-13 teams, so 100-150 families) stay at the same midsize resort hotel. To be clear, I'm a guest, not a hotel worker, but this story is too good to not put here.\n\nAs we're checking in, we had to sign a waiver, things like no running, no yelling, no hover boards, etc. One of the other parents cracked a joke under their breaths about discrimination against the kids, which the front desk worker overheard and explained that all large groups had to sign waivers, laughing as she said it. Turns out that the other group sharing the hotel this weekend was a \"adult novelty industry conference\" or in other words, a BDSM convention. Their waiver included things like no public exposure, no paraphernalia outside of the conference room, etc. Yes, I kid you not, the two main groups at the hotel this weekend were a merry band of fetishists and middle school basketball families.\n\nAt one point, I was in the elevator with three sixth graders, and two guys wearing these flamboyant blue leather suits, one of them holding a brief case. At one point I overheard a elementary school age kid asking his mom if he could go to the costume party. \n\nHighlights of the basketball families included:\n-Drunk parents permanently inhabiting the lobby\n\n-Older siblings permanently inhabiting a stairwell\n\n-Younger siblings permanently inhabiting the pool\n\n-3 different times where I got into an elevator to find all the buttons pressed\n\n-Massive SUV's blocking the carport for periods far longer than they were supposed to be there. \n\n-The entire 8th grade team gets kicked out of the area where the BDSM conference is being held\n\n-The entire 7th grade team gets kicked out of the gym.\n-All the 5th\/6th grade parents and kids get called to the lobby for a discussion on proper conduct, specifically the elevator button pressing.\n\n-7th grade girls try to use the spa\n\nThe highlight had to be when five kids were chasing each other down a hallway, yelling one of their friends names. One of the wedding planners walks into the hall, saying \"So right down here is where your wedding will be\". At that moment, one of the kids gets tackled, going flying towards the wedding planner and narrowly missing her. Absolutely golden.\n\nTl;dr a youth basketball tournament and a BDSM convention are held in the same hotel, chaos ensues.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673808191.0},{"title":"Where do they find these people?!","author":"gogiants1988","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10d1mc8\/where_do_they_find_these_people\/","text":"I work at a small 52 room basic interior access economy hotel.

She supposedly worked at a similar property to ours before.  So she gets here the first day to train and has on pajama pants so we are off to a good start.

I wonder often how some people make it as far as they do.

There's a private security company with some guys here that I've gotten to know pretty well, so I was joking around with the supervisor as he grabbed some eggs. Bible Dude comes down with his wife, and I guess I stiffened up because the security guy perked up and gave me the \"are you OK?\" look. I smiled and nodded, and scooted off to the GM's office, OPM was there as well. They said they had talked to him, and added the note to his profile. If he said anything else or was proselytizing to anyone - guest or staff - to let them know. \\*sigh\\* He's an extra shiny member, here while his house is being remodeled, so he gets warnings.\n\nBack at the breakfast area, I put the cheerful customer service grin on and chatted around, including a warm welcome and short conversation with Bible Dude's wife while she made a waffle. Then he walked up to me with that look of \"Oh, she's going to be so happy with my \"helpful\" note!\" and I switched immediately to my ice cold disappointed mother persona, complete with raised eyebrow looking over the glasses almost daring him to say something.

Anyway, I think the title sums it up.\n\nAs you can probably guess from my first paragraph, English is not the main language in the country I live, but we do receive a lot of foreigners (business related mostly), so English is a must have. Spanish is a good addition, but not mandatory for hospitality. And this guy just can't utter a single word in English to save his life. For my own privacy, I'll keep his age vague, but let's just say he's 30+, working in hospitality for at least half this time and just can't speak English and literally told me he refuses to learn because \"he's old enough, has his life somewhat settled and the youth should battle for better opportunities, not him\". His words, not mine. Oh, but he also gets mad when people PTO approved by management and he doesn't, but isn't willing to put in as many hours as we do.\n\nBreaking into this to give an example, he literally raised his voice at the manager of front desk for approving PTO for me on a Saturday, but not doing the same for him EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER ASKED FOR IT. He said with all the words that, since me and my coworker, who speak English, are more qualified for the job, that they should fire him and it wouldn't take a toll on him at all.\n\nAlso, I'm being moved to NA, and that is enough reason in his head to have my mensal Sunday (in my country it's only mandatory to approve PTO for your employees one Sunday a month, and you all know how hospitality goes) removed and my Saturday break is also unfair, even though I worked Christmas Eve and Day, and New Years Eve and Day, and also helped the restaurant with the dinner for guests on New Years and literally started 2023 in the hotel. Fine, he did work both also, but we had 3 or 4 check ins tops, and he didn't lift a finger to help with the dinner, instead leaving two girls to it. Fine.\n\nMy coworker was supposed to have her Sunday break today with the manager of the front desk, but she didn't give it to her \"because she was afraid of what this specific coworker would think\". She didn't need to complete that she was afraid he would berate her again, we all know the story at the front desk, it went from one person to another.\n\nHe also does the most he can to not work, except when I'm around, since we were admitted around the same time and now seems like he's worried I'll get more noticed than him, even though I already am, since he does nothing.\n\nThe icing on the cake? He once tried to act arrogant on me and said coworker because we had put in more hours than we were supposed to and we're being released early. He did that, we gave him the cold shoulder and he immediately changed his behavior, but it still pisses me off how he thinks he can handle his coworkers however he pleases just because he's the only man at the front desk, as if that changes anything.\n\nAnyways, I think I just needed a place to vent, but if you have any opinions on how to handle him the way he deserves without being fired, don't let me stop you from sharing.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1673801274.0},{"title":"\"Do you have a do not rent list, and am I on it?\"","author":"AllenHana426","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10cb36a\/do_you_have_a_do_not_rent_list_and_am_i_on_it\/","text":"A quick disclaimer before I start: Some of the details of what lead up to this are a bit fuzzy in my mind, and a fair bit of it is second or third hand information.

While there were never any clear violations of hotel policy or the law on her part that we were aware of, there was a lot of sketchy behavior including having her daughter and daughter's boyfriend who she had called the cops on for either stealing money from her or attacking her or both come to her room a few times, having a bunch of random people in and out of her room, and wanting to extend one night at a time, paying cash each night. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't have access to my property's DNR list, so I fib a bit and say my computer is giving me issues so I'd have to call her back, but since she stayed with us before, we have her phone number on file so I can get a hold of her when it comes up. As I stumbled my way through my excuse, I sent a text to my GM and FOM explaining the situation. Thankfully, our FOM is VERY responsive and got back to me within 2 or 3 minutes saying that, yes, this lady is on our DNR list. I had assumed this was the case, but didn't want to say she was when she wasn't and cause a whole host of issues.

There has to be a reason!\n\nMe: I'm sorry, I truly don't know why this note is here. Just that my manager put it here, and I can not overrule that\n\n*There's some shuffling on the phone and I get a little worried*\n\nMan: Hello, this is Deputy Dewey (fake name) with the \\[city\\] police department. I'm here with Ms. Eris, and I just wanted to ask why she's on your DNR list. Was it non-payment maybe or some other issue?\n\nMe: Oh hi. Um, unfortunately, as I told Eris, I'm not sure why she is not on our DNR list. All I know is that there is a note from my manager from the day she checked out saying that we are unable to rent to her\n\nDewey: Okay, just making sure. Ms. Eris did say that she was able to make a reservation, so is it possible for you to refund her for that?\n\n*Yes, I could tell him there was sketchy behavior in her room before, but I don't wanna risk some sort of lawsuit or something as there's no proof of any illegal activity.

I mentioned in the comments that one time I was challenged to a duel by a customer, and you guys wanted the tea. Well, that'll be the last story because I have a few to tell from working at one of the cheaper hotels in the middle of a tourist spot.\n\nSo, a little background first just so you can get an idea of the area. We're a little 2 story hotel with about 80 rooms in the middle of a super popular tourist spot. I do the night audit, which I'm sure is where many of your stories come from. I've only been doing this about 2 and a half years while I'm in school for nursing, and this has been the full-time job of choice for me. I'd be willing to bet that many people doing night audit at the front desk are in school because during the off season it's like an 8 hour study period.\n\nThe first one was back before I started not giving a shit. There's always a point in any career field where you go from caring about getting every detail right to not caring whether the building burns down, so long as it's not on your shift. This was well before that point. A lady had checked in, early in the day. I was covering a mid-shift, so I was the one who checked her in. She was from out of town, and alone. She talked a lot to me about... seemingly whatever came to mind. Her reservation was for a few days, and so over the first couple days, she would make it a point to start a long, one-sided conversation with me whenever she went by. There was one time I actually went prone on the floor when I saw her on the camera, waddling up the hallway towards the front desk. The mission was a success, and the interaction was avoided. Anyways, that's not the story. There was clearly something off about this lady from the start. She would always be mumbling to herself, and here eyes were constantly darting all over the place. Conveniently, her room was actually directly in front of one of the cameras, which will come up later.\n\nOne night, I was working a double (it always seems to happen when you're working a double...), and the place was quiet as could be. I was on the computer, just zoning out like you do on a quiet night, when I heard quick shuffling of feet directly around the corner that's next to me, and she popped out from around it. Her eyes were red from crying, and her entire face was wet with tears. As soon as we made eye contact, she burst into hysteric crying. It's 2 in the morning, my people. I have no idea what to do, and I basically have no resources since at the time it was likely that if I called my GM into work at 2am, I'd be brought into the back and beheaded.\n\nSo she's sobbing, and I finally ask her what's wrong after the initial what-the-fuck-is-going-on moment passed. She says that people have been in here room... Now I'm also scared alongside her... What am I supposed to do about that??? Then, to add fuel to the fire, she tells me that they took pictures of her without her knowing. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? I had not called the police for anything at that point, as you all would understand that if you've never done it before, calling the police on the job is just a terrifying prospect. So I'm kinda panicking as well, and I asked her if she was okay. She said yeah, and I told her that her room was directly in front of a camera, so it was impossible for whoever did this to get away with it.\n\nShe then tells me that she can show me the pictures they took... Which, honestly, should have raised more of a red flag than it did, but I was not exactly in detective mode. She takes out her phone and shows me the first picture. It's... a selfie? Like, she went to the mirror in the room and took a selfie... I'm thoroughly confused at this point, and the adrenaline is starting to wear off. I remember taking a second to carefully think about what to say at this point, and ultimately figured that this lady was clearly not of sound mind and took the direct approach. I told her that she was holding the camera in that photo. She replied with, \"There are more!\" and showed me another photo. I'll describe how the photo was taken instead of what the photo was because you'll understand what I was looking at better. Imagine you walk into the room, and lay on the bed, shoes still on. You take out your phone and hold it at about where you would if you were going to text someone. But instead of texting someone, you take a photo of the lower half of your body. That's what it was. A photo from a sitting position on the bed of the lower half of her body (I praise the lord every night that she was clothed). She had on these INCREDIBLY DISTINCTIVE red boots.\n\nI swear to god, there was a moment of silence and I leaned over the counter to look at her shoes... She was still wearing exactly everything she was wearing in the photo... So at this point, I figured there was simply nothing I could do here. I told her that I was very sorry that she was having a rough time and reassured her that her room was located directly in front of one of our cameras. I told her that I would keep an eye on it throughout the night, and if she had any more concerns, she should stop by in the morning when the GM was on duty. She could help her more than I could. This seemed to work, and she just made her way to the room. I, of course, stayed glued to that camera after she left, and when she got to the room, she grabbed the door handle and just fucking slowly turned around and looked at the camera in the creepiest, most straight-out-of-a-horror-movie fashion I have ever seen and essentially made eye contact with me. No tears, no panic, no nothing. The manager never heard from her and I am basically sitting here with this material for a Stephen King novel all to myself (and now for you lovely people!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext is actually something that made it to the news I think, so I am going to leave as much as I can from it that doesn't really pinpoint where I am, however I'm sure it probably isn't hard to find...  Also, this story should have some kind of trigger warning attached to it, so if you're sensitive to any kind of domestic violence, probably skip this one. I've used large spaces to separate these so it looks a bit better.\n\nFor many months, we had a person staying here in a particular room. It was him (probably mid 30s), and this girl who was clearly around 18-20 years old. Very young, and I want to throw up every time I think of this story, but here we are. So, every once in a while, you could hear them arguing from down the hall. I had to knock on the door many times and tell them to quiet down (this was a while after the fuck-giving period ended). Every so often, the girl would come downstairs with cuts, gashes, and bruises all about her body. There was even one time where one of her arms had 5 perfectly finger-shaped bruises wrapped around it. Every time I asked her if she was okay, she'd make up something like she fell, or she hit it on something. Clearly a fucked up situation. The GM had some kind of distant relation to the guy though, and so she never kicked him out. She would threaten him with kicking him out after he made a ruckus on her shift, but ultimately he had to pry himself out of the hotel for anything to actually happen.\n\nSo, the day of reckoning came at last, and of course, like all these things, it happened at like 4 in the morning, and conveniently on my shift. I was reading a school textbook and taking notes behind the counter when I heard what could only be described as a meaty thwack. It was followed by a yelp, and then a huge crash. I made my way to the room and knocked on the door. The guy opened it and was cool as could be. He told me everything was fine, and that he just sat on the desk, which broke. He followed this up with telling me he'd pay for it in the morning.\n\nThis entire time he's giving me this pitch, I'm looking inside the room and can clearly see what's going on. Behind him, the girl was laying on the floor, basically gasping for air. The left side of her face was all messed up. Honestly, I won't go much more into detail than that because it was pretty bad. The desk was also completely destroyed. In the center, where you'd usually sit in the chair, it was caved in. Wood chips were everywhere, including sticking out of this poor girl's face. Pretty quickly I understood what was going on and just told the guy ok, talk to the GM tomorrow to figure that one out.\n\nOf course, I immediately went down and hit the little worn-out little button on the phone which directly dials the non-emergency number for the local police. I described exactly what I saw, and told them that this girl was obviously being abused, and if he or she made up some kind of excuse, she would at the very least need some kind of medical attention. I remember thinking that maybe, if there was any kind of good in this world, that if there were enough records showing that something like this was happening, it could lead to this dirt bag being caught.\n\nWithin minutes, the cop shows up, and comes to me. He starts with the usual, getting my info and the whole story. While he's talking to me, I see the guy outside, obviously trying to sneak to his car. The hotel is small, but our front doors are big, and made of glass. I have a direct view of 7 parking spots (I just counted), which are the ones that fill up the fastest, and he was backed into one of them. So I looked at the officer and just said, \"Actually, the guy is right there going to his car if you wanted to talk to him.\" and the officer whipped around. As soon as the officer and the dude made eye contact through the window, the dude stepped on it and skidded out. The officer didn't even say anything like, \"oh fuck\" or \"god damnit\", bless his soul, but he did immediately take off after him and start speaking cop into his radio.\n\nAfter that, I only know what I was told by the GM, who said it made it to the news. I guess what happened next was a car chase down the main strip that we are off of. The way the road is structured, I could only hear the sirens race off into the distance. He eventually pulled off into a field or something and took off on foot through a forest. Dogs were set after him, and apparently this guy punched one of the dogs in the ribs and hurt it pretty badly (the dog is okay now, no worries), but not before the dog ripped out a good chunk of this guy's leg and basically crippled him temporarily, long enough for the officers to catch up and detain him. From what I understand, he's still in jail. The girl supposedly flew back to where she is from and is living with her parents. Kinda a happy ending? It's always hard to say with these types of situations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk I didn't realize just how many stories I actually have, so I'll try to wrap this last one up quickly since I don't actually know what the max character count is on reddit.\n\nThis was last year, actually. A little more about me, I think I may be bipolar, but I've never really been diagnosed with anything. That's just to say that for long periods of time, I'll basically become a husk, just kinda reacting to things and not really feeling anything, and then for another long period of time, I'll feel like I could conquer the world. This was right in the middle of a low swing. It's kinda relevant to explain why I reacted in the way I did (not an excuse, of course), but anyways...\n\nI was challenged to a duel. I'll give you a single guess as to what time in the morning it was. A woman came in and was kinda sketchy. She was just kinda... walking sideways? Idk how else to describe it, but she wasn't acting normal. Already some red flags. She asked me if I had a room available, and I gave her the usual info. $84... After tax... She heard me the first time though, which was great. But she kept looking around the room and down the hallways.\n\nWhen I typed in all her info and asked for the payment, the card declined. She didn't really seem surprised though, she just kept looking down the halls. She told me to give her a minute, and then asked where the bathroom was. Now, we have cameras all around the building, including one pointing at the restrooms. I gave her the directions, and instead of going into the bathroom, which was in the complete opposite direction of the halls, she took off down the hallway, where the rooms are.\n\nI'll be completely honest. I didn't feel like chasing this lady. So, I just let her explore. Admittedly, my fault. And all of what happened next is directly a result of this, which I fully take responsibility for, so no need for pitchforks, please.\n\nNext thing I know (And in my defense, it happened so quickly that I don't think that if I took off after her, I would have made it in time), there was a lot of yelling in the hallway. I didn't have to leave my post because 3 people made their way to the front lobby, which became the battlegrounds.\n\nIt was a man and 2 women. I'm sure you've already deduced what has happened here, but I'll explain. This woman had come into the hotel looking for this guy. Idk the exact details, however I quickly found out plenty. This guy was with a woman in a room at the hotel. Obviously, the angry lady didn't like that very much, and whatever deity that is in charge of the random events which happen in the world decided that this guy would leave his room at the exact moment the angry lady decided to explore our hallways. A lot of yelling happened very quickly, and Angry Lady went into combat mode.\n\nThe girl that the guy was with took off down the hall and towards the front desk after the dude basically rugby tackled this woman out of the way. He followed her down the hall to the lobby, where the death match began. I got the absolute perfect view on the camera. It was glorious. \n\nYou know when UFC fighters circle around the ring, scoping eachother out? Well, that's basically what they were doing, but I don't think it was because they knew what they were doing, I think that neither of them wanted to be punched in the face. Anyways, they start yelling. The guy is yelling at AL, \"You ain't my bitch! We done! We been done!\" and Angry Lady was yelling something along the lines of, \"She a skank ass slut\" and they are just kinda going back and forth. The entire time, the girl was just completely terrified behind this guy, watching a very animated angry woman try and sneak a jab in as often as she could.\n\nI don't know why I didn't immediately call the cops, but I did speak up after just kinda watching the show for a second. You know when something like this happens, you get butterflies in your chest and you enter fight or flight mode? Well I can only really describe the feelings I was experiencing as just... Nothing? Like I was simply watching a movie. So I said, \"Can you please take this outside? We have guests trying to sleep.\"\n\nWell, none of them really liked that very much because the expression on the guy's face was one of bewilderment, the girl kinda made a 'wtf' face, and immediately after I said it, Angry Lady turns to me and said something along the lines of, \"I'll kick your ass too, you want to fight me right now?\"\n\nNot wanting to duel, I just sort of let out a sigh and sat down in the chair, picked up the phone, and pressed the non-emergency button. Right there in front of them, I explained what was happening to the agent. They all heard me, and it very quickly stopped the fighting. However, it didn't stop the arguing, which the woman on the phone could hear very clearly, and she chipperly told me she'd send someone right away. \n\nSo, of course, they had to go on for just long enough to be sure that they could all leave before the cop arrived. Luckily, the police are pretty used to having to come here during the day, so when something happens at night, they arrive pretty quickly. The officer got here right as Angry Lady left. However, he was able to sit the man and the woman down and get what he could from them. Then he asked me what happened, and I told him.\n\nI never really got a follow up on the story, but later that night, when I went to sweep the floor, I found 2 fake nails on the ground, which were remnants of the epic battle. Then, when I came in the next night, the GM was laughing because she said she had to pull up the cameras and you could see me stand up, tell them to take it outside, then calmly sit back down and casually cross my legs while I talked on the phone, while in the background 3 people duked it out in an incredibly dramatic fashion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, those are the ones that came to mind off the top of my head. I think I told someone that I have only ever called the cops one time, but I'm realizing now that I may have called them a couple times in the past few years. Sorry about that, a lot happens here! And usually the one calling the cops is the GM. I think she actually knows a few by their first names. \n\nI know I have some more stories, but these are the most memorable. I'll definitely post some more in the future!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673772020.0},{"title":"Minimum stay hockey tournament","author":"Hotelmanager85","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10cat8v\/minimum_stay_hockey_tournament\/","text":"Do your hotels have hockey\/sports tournaments that are minimum night stays.

I didn't ever think there would be a follow-up to my first story [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zy2fa7\/threatened_with_gang_violence\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nThere I was, minding my own business. It was around 6:30 AM. Any moment, AM shift would arrive and relieve me, and she so happened to always arrive at 6:45 AM. I had made breakfast but no one was coming down. We had under 15% occupancy, so I figured I wouldn't see anyone. It was *way* past crackhead o'clock, so I wasn't worried about anything sketchy happening for the rest of my shift.\n\nI hear the front doors open, and since my coworker was due any second, I absentmindedly remote unlocked the second pair of doors. I look up to greet AM, but am surprised to see two bundled up people quickly passing my desk. I only had a glimpse of them, but I recognized the man immediately as the St. Luis gang member from a month ago, down to the two teardrops under his eye. He's carrying a soft luggage bag, and the woman accompanying him has a heavy backpack on. They practically sprint across the lobby to avoid me, but I yell at them to stop. I had seen no one exit the whole day, not to say they didn't go out the side door, but I know for a fact no one would have let this fucker rent from us after the incident with him. I mean, he's really identifiable. That face tattoo and being a little taller than five feet tall. Plus, why would they run across the room with luggage? At this time of day, you should be *leaving*.\n\nThey stop right behind a wall, near the business center. I can't see them that well, but I know they're there. I tell them they cannot enter the hotel without providing me their room number. From what I can see of them, they look to each other for an answer. They provide me a room number, and I look it up. Sure enough, no one is in that room. Like I said earlier, we had only around five rooms occupied, so I knew this would be a lie. I informed them that no one is in that room, and am greeted by silence. I began to hear them whispering to each other. The woman starts mumbling about how weird it was that their room wasn't showing up, and I told them they didn't have a room here and needed to leave immediately. They stand around for a few more moments before shuffling back to the desk, mumbling to themselves. They looked unsure. When I see the man pop from behind the corner, my fears were realized. This was no doubt the same man. I order them to leave, and they stand around for a little bit. After I threaten them with police, they stomp out the door. The man threatens me with legal action, saying I was discriminating against them, and I told them they were in their right to do so, just like I was in my right to order them to leave. When I know the doors are locked, I run to the laundry room. The last time I dealt with him, he started screaming through the windows, and I wasn't about to have any retaliation.\n\nI call the cops anyway, since I didn't feel safe. I describe my situation, what they were wearing, if there were any weapons, that sort of thing. Dispatch said police were on their way and that if I didn't feel safe, I could stay on the line. I didn't feel comfortable, but if any guests came down, I couldn't be on the phone with police. I didn't want to make anyone feel unsafe at the hotel. Eventually, two or three cops came and I described the situation to them. I didn't hear a car leave, so I explained that they may still be in the area on foot. One of the cops left to go investigate. The other one asked if I wanted to trespass the man; I took the liberty and said yes. Later talking to my boss, he said I was good to do that.\n\nI am just a little confused about the situation. Why would he come back if I refused him service the first time? I know it had been a month or so, but I wouldn't have changed my mind either way. He was DNR'ed by me the first time, did he expect for it to change? Also... what was with the luggage they had? You need a key to get into my hotel's rooms, like any other hotel. No doors are open. Were they just passing through the hotel to go out the side doors, or were they going to camp out somewhere? I am just left with a lot of questions. I am a little nervous, because he has been the only crackhead to show up twice like this. I am scared I'm going to see him again and have to explain that he is trespassed. I've never had to do that before, so it's new territory, is all. I guess only time will tell. I would have never let him in if I would have just not assumed it was AM coming at their usual time. I am waiting for my boss to fix the card reader outside so guests can let themselves in. What I would really like is an intercom. Shouting at people through the door is a challenge. But it's a little impossible to get my boss to follow through with anything. At least the door locks.\n\n\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673769150.0},{"title":"Sorry I can't physically move rooms around","author":"PleasantPhysics7982","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10bu85e\/sorry_i_cant_physically_move_rooms_around\/","text":"So this happened this morning on the phone.

She then asks if the rooms are adjoined and I say that only our standard queen rooms (maybe suites tbh I don't go in the rooms so idk) are adjoined by an internal door. She then asks if the rooms can be next door to eachother. There are 8 of each type of deluxe sweet and 2 of each per floor. They occur every 4 rooms, so they are spaced apart and not neighboring. I tell her this but offer to downgrade one of the rooms to get them across the hall from eachother.  She says that she loves our deluxe suites and wants them.

Here's my story of people being people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though many hotels carry rollaway beds, they don't fit into every room type. And even if they did, we can't put them into every room due to the fire marshal tells us, for safety reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, this particular night I was working night audit and a lady came down and asked me if we could have a rollaway brought up to her room. Now, when I would get this request, the first thing I would do is look up the room number to see if I could do that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe room that she was in had 2 queen beds, so I automatically knew that I couldn't oblige her request. One: The bed wouldn't fit. Two: Even if it could, because of the spacing, the door would be blocked. Thus, creating a fire hazard.\n\nNow, I'm not a complete ogre most of the time. When I've gotten this request in the past, I would explain why but then give options, i.e., extra sheets and blankets to make a pallet on the floor and etc. But this one wasn't going to be easy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe: Ma'am, because of fire codes, I'm not allowed to place a rollaway into that room type. However, I can offer abc, xyz.\n\nMs. I'm Special: So you can't even make an exception this one time?\n\nMe: (thinking Here we go!) Ma'am, as I've stated, due to the city fire codes I am not allowed to do so.\n\nMs. I'm Special: So you're not even going to attempt to place one in the room? This is very inconvenient.\n\nMe (trying not to allow my asshole tendency to show): Ma'am, there are rules that I have to follow, and this is one of those rules.\n\nMs. I'm Special: I don't see how that has anything to do with this.\n\nMe: (fuck it now): Ma'am, I cannot do what you're asking because it is illegal. So, outside of me breaking the law, what do YOU suggest I do?\n\nMs. I'm Special: (looking shocked) I'll take the extra sheets and blankets then. But did you really have to say it like that?\n\nMe: You have a good evening ma'am.\n\nWhile all of this was going on, there was someone else in the lobby who I had completely forgotten about.

He asks her how much, and she turns to me and asks me how much for a night.

I tell her that the price for a night is $84 after tax.\n\nShe turns around, still talking aloud on the phone and walks out. Ok cool, I\u2019ve had enough time to create the reservation and print off keys, etc for when she gets the money.\n\n5 minutes later, both her and the guy come in, and she demands him to give me his card, then turns to me and asks how much the room is.\n\nI\u2019m a patient man.

I flop into bed, but about an hour later I hear a yapping, barking dog coming from the street outside. I peep out the window and see a guy and a dog walking down the street. An hour later, same thing, although this time I can't see where they are. At around 1am, I wake up and hear it AGAIN and I look. Here they come way up the street, the dog barking up a storm. I wait a few moments because I'm going to yell at this guy--my customer or not, it's too late at night for this constant barking and it's going to disturb our guests.\n\nI start to yell when I realize, this guy is yelling at the dog to get away. This guy has no relation to the dog at all; the dog has just been kind of following him around barking for the last few HOURS....on a busy road! As the bars let out! Once I realize the dog doesn't belong to he guy, it dawns on me that we have a guest who has a dog who looks just like this one! Now I'm scared for the dog's sake. I run downstairs in my oversize t-shirt and underpants (THE DOG WAS IN THE STREET) and see the guest's OTHER DOG sitting in the parking lot, also yapping! I try to call the dogs but they aren't listening, so I run back into the office to log in and bring up the calendar to see what room this joker is staying in.\n\nTurns out, didn't need to do that! Because when I get near his room, I see his door is wide open! WTF? I burst in and he's drunk off his ass but kind of sitting on the bed because I must have awakened him with my yelling. And he's not wearing pants! This guy is a really nice guest, but he's his own worst enemy when he drinks, which is rare but obviously ill-advised! He was on the verge of a DNR before this visit and I WARNED HIM.\n\nI start yelling at him and it got a little comical at this point because, in slow motion, I could see the expressions on his face slowly change as the realizations dawned on him, one after another: First, he looked shocked someone had burst into his room, then a wide smile spread across his face as he realized it was me and he was about to greet me, then he stands up and realizes HE'S NOT WEARING ANY PANTS and looks panicked and grabbed for a pillow to cover up as he quickly plopped back down on the bed, THEN his eyes go down a bit and he realizes I AM ALSO IN MY UNDERWEAR (with a large t-shirt...really not much different than a bathing suit) and he looks horrified! But I was so mad, I didn't care!\n\nI read him the riot act! I called him a train wreck! I told him alcohol was not his friend! I yelled he was a TERRIBLE dog-owner and he was banned from the hotel because he's an out-of-control drunk! I told him barking dogs and a wide-open door with a naked drunk passed out in clear view was NOT the image of the hotel we wanted to portray!\n\nObviously as I was berating him, I was mentally doing a room check and inventory. It actually looked good, linen was clean, no food lying around, no messes, and no dog pee. (Of course, why would there be dog pee?

That said, today several things happened that are decidedly front desk tasks - and just plain weird. Thought I would share.\n\nI. \nWe received several official looking letters (from the state & tax office) for a company that apparently registered their place of business here at our address. Nope, never heard of them, and no idea how that would even be possible. Anyway, I went and told our village postal lady that there's no company XY here, please return to sender. Hum. I somehow doubt that's the last we'll hear about that. \n\nII.\nAround 6pm we received a booking for this evening via OTA. I normally disable same-day bookings, but it's the off season, so we switched them back on. In order to confirm the time of arrival I gave them a call. First try: didn't go through. Sent a message, tried calling again half an hour later. A  woman answers and tells me they'll be here around 9pm (the tail end of our regular check-in hours, since, honestly, I like at least an hour or two for ourselves after the long work days we have here). \n\nFine, no worries. I make dinner and take the dog for a walk around 8:50 - my partner was there to let the guests in. On my way out I spotted a car turning into our driveway - great, that must be them!I'm sure partner's got it covered. Around 15 minutes later I come back and see the same car pulling back out of the driveway. Okay, maybe getting food, I think and go inside to talk to my partner. Turns out they never came inside, never rang the bell and just... left?\nI tried calling them twice. Declined twice. Huh. Weird day over, I think. \n\nIII.\nNope. Weird day not over. 11:30pm - the bell for checked in guests rings. Uh-oh. They were having a shower and the hot water ran out. \n\nBackground: as a B&B, we provide hot water throughout the day. However, after 10 pm the heater for our two doubles upstairs switches off till the early morning, so the hot water is limited to what's kept hot in the tanks - normally more than enough for four showers. Not today. Somehow, all four guests must habe had extended showers - and emptied the hot water. So here was me - in my PJs (breakfast prep starts at 7) turning the heater back on so they could finish their shower, apologizing profusely. Whoops. \n\nThe good part? It's now officially after midnight. Friday 13th is over. We'll see what new craziness breakfast will bring... for now: good night folks, hope you're having a less weird day!","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673652586.0},{"title":"Weekly Free For All Thread","author":"marmothelm","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10bfymd\/weekly_free_for_all_thread\/","text":"Want to talk about something that isn't a front desk tale?

They came every summer and stayed for a month. They both dressed in color coordinated pantsuit outfits, usually in pastel colors. My favorite was the lavender outfit with hats. \n\nThey had one of those double strollers for children that they put their older Maltese dogs in for walks. Just all around enjoyable people that cares about everyone around them. \n\nOne day we were talking when they came back from a walk and I\u2019m not sure how it came up but I mentioned I couldn\u2019t afford great furniture and loved to thrift and find things on the side of the road.

Husband and I were on our walk when we noticed a chair in the river and remembered you said that you didn\u2019t have furniture so husband went and got it out for you. We put it behind the electrical box. It has some moss on it so you may want to clean it off.\u201d\n\nOr something along those lines. I don\u2019t have it in front of me.\n\nI went and looked and sure enough, there was a red, metal outdoor restaurant chair with moss on it behind the electrical box outside. I recognized it immediately because the restaurant across the street has the same ones. \n\nIt\u2019s a ski town. Some drunk kid must of thought it would be funny to throw it into the river one night. But it is a slick and muddy drop down into the river (more of a creek at this point in summer) but flowing heavily enough to catch moss from upstream in a day or two. It wasn\u2019t there before. It was a decently steep embankment and sketchy enough for me to not like getting down there in good shoes as a ski instructor. \n\nBut this cute old couple cared so much about me that husband climbed down there, probably in a cute periwinkle dress suit, with sweet wife and their tiny old dogs in a kid stroller up top, to retrieve and carry it to back to the leasing office.\n\nI never got to see them again because I left before they came back the next year but I did call and he said \u201cIt was no big deal!

One particular guest took a pretty quick liking to me and, over the three months that she stayed there, we had a nice friendship. Since I was the night auditor, we would often talk around 2am-4am when there wasn\u2019t too much else going on.\n\nThis lady was nuts, but in a fun, quirky way. She would build rock cairns around the property. She would come back with wild harvested mushrooms. I even saw her once or twice on the security cameras dancing by herself in the stairwell. She was just this really sweet witchy lady who would bring me chai lattes and talk my ear off on the nights when she forgot to take her adderall. \n\nShe told me all about her life, her former husbands, her estranged children, long lost pets, forgotten dreams, and lingering traumas. I don\u2019t remember much about the details of her life, but there is one story she told me that I will never forget. She told me that in the 90s she had discovered that her daughter was in an abusive relationship with some man. After fleeing from a particularly bad fight, her daughter came to her and told her that this man had raped her. She didn\u2019t explain how she did it, but she told me that the next time she saw him she ran him over with her truck and he died. Neither the police nor her daughter ever discovered what she did.\n\nAfter telling me this, I asked her if she had any regrets about the situation. She told me no. So in reply I said to her that there was nothing to worry about; if her conscience was clear then there is nothing that she needed to do. She thanked me and said to me that she enjoyed our conversations because I listened to her without judgement. Indeed, I felt my role as a night auditor was truly multifaceted. At times I was a secretary, a custodian, a security guard, a therapist, and a priest.\n\nShe left the hotel soon after that conversation to move into a new apartment and I never heard from her again. I don\u2019t know if what she told me was true. After all, she told me lots of ludicrous things that are likely not true. I guess it doesn\u2019t matter if she really killed a man or not (but I kinda hope she did. Is that wrong?).

Things seemed to be going well, or getting better for awhile, and I was starting to feel okay again, but my snake in the grass coworker is at it again.\n\nHe's poisoned my fourteen year relationship with my boss, but smiles in my face. If you ever want to get to the top of the dead end ladder, I guess you just befriend your co-manager, secure the 7-3 shift, and then badmouth said comanager under the guise of concern.\n\nI was called into a meeting that he'd riled me up for, telling me to say x, y, and z. Then, after he'd talked all this shit with me about our GM\/owner. I was cornered. I knew what he was trying to do, but he began dressing me down, and making me feel worthless.\n\nI pointed out that neither of them know what I do, because they don't work 3-11, so they never work with me. I don't get complaints from guests about me. I pointed out that I get a lot of tips, and I don't remember what the example was but the night before I'd bent over backward for a guest, and they were singing my praises for the rest of their stay. Then I pointed out that my coworker obviously is talking shit about me to GM all day, and throwing me under the bus, while riling me up. He later admitted this to me on another occasion, while admitting to \"lying, and scheming to survive here.\"\n\nWhatever, I don't really care. This job isn't the end all be all. I make $10.75 an hour with 13 years of experience, and a college degree.\n\nSo, anyway, yesterday I went to my psychiatrist, and admitted to him that I felt bullied and undervalued at work, and told him how much I was paid, and how I feel like the job is causing unnecessary anxiety.\n\nI never in a million years thought that a psychiatrist would advise me to quit my job, especially without having anything lined up. So, I told him that I would seriously consider it. Trust me, I've heard this advice a million and one times-- but from a psychiatrist? It put it into perspective, for sure.\n\nSo, I leave feeling validated, and even stopped, and got a haircut on my way home. I was feeling myself, and decided to put in my George Michael-esque dangly earring. Officially, we aren't (as men) allowed to wear them. That said, the snake in the grass, and his little brother always do.\n\nMy boss was clearly in one of her moods (apparently set off because I didn't resell a room with a bunch of lady bugs in it the night before. So, again, I'm feeling myself, happy, on top of the world, and she tells me that earrings aren't allowed. She then sees that I'm looking at the brother of the snake, and covers her ass by telling him his aren't allowed either.\n\nI stewed for a bit, and then confronted her. She told me that she didn't have to justify herself. Then she went off about what she was actually mad about-- the hotel hold on the bug infested room.\n\nI was already considering leaving, and finally cut her off, and said, \"I don't feel well, and I need to go home.\" I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but she told me it was my choice, but she would cut my hours. Mental health is health, and that screams retaliation to me. So, an argument ensues, and I told her that it was unfair of her to criticize my earring, and she scoffed at me, and told me to \"Just go.\"\n\nCue today, I wake up at 1:30 to a panic attack, and have to take my first Xanax in months (my anxiety has been under pretty good control, and the doctors don't like for me to take it, and I agree btw). So, I'm at work low energy as hell, but the good news is that I have the next two days off. Sunday, I work by myself. I just need to get through Monday, and I'll be going to meet my boyfriend in Cali for my first week long vacation since like 2012. We're staying with my employee discount, so no need to quit just yet.\n\nI am thinking about what will happen when I get back home. I've been approved to deliver for a delivery service, so I may just give no notice, and quit.

I don't know I'm not a banker. I'm just someone who doesnt like to be cussed out, has too much time on their hands, and is bored\"  \n\nHe then uttered the most beautiful words that someone in customer service could hear. \"I WILL NEVER STAY AT (hotel with rewards program) EVER AGAIN\" strike 3. Checkmate, bitch! I tell him thats understandable and for him to have a good day. And call up rewards support to have his high tiered account deactivated. Of course they ask me why and I just tell them the truth. Based on my interpretation of him in his \"delightful\" phone call saying he will never stay at this hotel again, he wouldn't be needing his membership. They obliged and I went back to record the incident in my log book. \n\nI don't think this will actively ruin his life. If he wanted to he could call rewards support and get the account back. I'm not sure how many points he had, or if he will get all of them back. I just wanted to show him the consequences of his actions. We have power. We need to use it. The customer is often wrong.\n\nEdit: decided to put the less offensive cuss word in its entirety.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673421775.0},{"title":"I Feel Like An A\u2026","author":"saiconjr","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/1092imj\/i_feel_like_an_a\/","text":"Tonight was quiet, had run audit, everything was going fine.

I go up to check and lo, there\u2019s a beautiful and very friendly (pit bull? Rot willer?) dog sitting on the floor outside the rooms following me around. I\u2019m doing my duties and it just follows around and wants to play and hang with me. Not just me but other guests coming down in the early AM. \n\nHowever I have to call animal services, only to find out they have no room at the shelters so I can either let it stay in the back with me until I leave or let it wander the parking lot. I text my boss only for her to also lament why animal services couldn\u2019t pick it up and tell me to let it out. So now I have to keep leading the dog outside and away until the owner comes down looking for him. Worse, when they claim him they\u2019re going to be hit with a fee.

The email asks for a total price on the entire stay, including the two meals a day, the convention centre and the rooms.

They also may need to extend. They will not be coming with the company card and would like to have direct billing after the stay. You google the company and see it appears to have a Facebook page but no website. It does, however, have a Google business page with several decent reviews and a couple bad reviews.

We are regularly used by insurance companies when there is issues with homes like floods or power cuts for prolonged time.\n\nWe had a female guest housed with us after a burst pipe in her house she seemed fine on check in however she seemed to want to make life hell. \n\nShe comes to the desk to tell me her hairdryer won\u2019t work and she doesn\u2019t have a kettle and needs a kettle for her room. I explained it was in the cupboard under her television unit and she said come show me it\u2019s not there I\u2019ve looked. So we go to her room and low and behold the kettle along with the teas and coffee is in this unit. She proceeds to accuse me of bringing it down with me even though we walked down together the entire time. She then reminded me about her hairdryer so I walk over and low and behold it works. She also accuses me of bringing a new one down in my pocket. (I wear a blazer to work with tiny pockets so the logic just wasn\u2019t there) \n\nSo I\u2019m off the next day and she\u2019s requested dry cleaning during my day off and is told to return it to me the next day and it\u2019ll be collected from me and sent off. She comes down and gives me the bag and says I was told you\u2019d take this home and wash it. I\u2019m shocked and confused. I explain I wouldn\u2019t be doing that and she said my colleague promised I would. I apologised and said I would look into it. Messaged all my colleagues all of them are like we never said that. One of my colleagues said she could return and request the dry cleaners we use to collect as he couldn\u2019t ask the night before due to her coming after the timeout dry cleaners requests close. This made a lot more sense. She came back and I explained and she screamed how she was told I would personally wash it for her and how it\u2019s not fair how I\u2019m treating her. I apologise and she storms off only to return not even half an hour later to scream at me about owing her money. She paid for her room outright on check in with one of my colleagues and the company who were fixing her house asked her to get invoices and send them to the company to be reimbursed. \n\nThe woman never did this. Not once prior to the following conversation. I will refer to her as Karen(K)\n\nK-\u201cYou owe me money. You\u2019ve stolen my money.

They then said she\u2019s been ringing them and screaming at them all day, I said I feel you I\u2019ve had the same. \n\nShe then get locked in her room and I\u2019m one of the two to get her out.

Almost 20 years ago, at the second property I had ever worked at, we had an elderly woman and her son rent a room.  Her son was nice, but despite him being in his 40s (50s, maybe?), he had the mind of a young boy.  She'd sold her house (3 bedroom) for 100k, and it hadn't occurred to her that she might want to find a new place to live before she moved out, so she stayed with us for several months.  She'd settled in to the point where she brought in her rocking chair.  Finally, she checked out, but came back a week or two later.  Repeat this cycle a few times for the next year.  \n\nPersonally, I'd grown to seriously dislike her.  Aside from her constant complaints, none of which I remember after all this time, there was the fact she was spending her money staying in hotels rather than use the money she had to actually find a home.  As nice as her son was, it was obvious he wasn't really in a position to take care of himself when she wasn't around anymore.  Oh, and why couldn't she find a home?  Because she insisted she'd only buy a 3 bedroom house in the same neighborhood as the house she'd already sold, and there weren't any like that for sale.  Yes, she would only buy a house that was just like the one she'd just sold...\n\nEventually, I left that hotel, and went on to a larger, full service place.  New, competent coworkers.  New guests.  No crazy old woman.  Until she started staying there.  I don't know why she chose my new property, but she did, and the cycle started again.  Some time during her stays at the old place, she'd enrolled in our loyalty program, and earned a LOT of points during that time, and never used them.  Well, she started using them at the new place.  Of course that's not a problem, but there were times she'd use the last of her points for a free night, and wouldn't arrange ahead of time how to pay for the next night.  That's when I'd come to especially despise her, rather than just dislike her.  \n\nI'd been told when I came in to start my shift that we needed to ask her how she was going to pay for her room that night, as her last free night had just been used.  When she came in with her son, I waved her over, and quietly explained it to her.  Did she want to use another free night (assuming she had points), or did she want to pay for it using her credit card?  She told me she'd come back with her card.  That's fine.  Until I came back in the next day.  My boss told me that I had a complaint against me from a guest.  Who?  Crazy old woman.  She told the manager I had screamed at her in front of a lobby full of people that she owed me money.  The complaint went nowhere, but I was pissed.  From that point on, if she came anywhere near the front desk, I went in the back office and let whomever I was working with deal with her.  \n\nMy boss insisted there were just communication issues between us.  That was, until the crazy old lady complained about something to my boss.  Thinking she'd get a laugh out of her, my boss said \"I'll add that to the bitch list.\"  Well, now there was a new complaint, but against my boss, for calling her a bitch.  Now all of a sudden there's not a communication problem.  She's just an old bitch, and was told I had the right to say \"I told you so.\"  I said that might be, but I wasn't going to say it.  I had my boss so mad at me, she kept insisting I say the words \"I told you so\" and I just wouldn't.  Seriously, imagine the person you're working for get mad at you because you won't be childish.\n\nAfter that, we'd gotten a new girl working the front desk, and not only did she know the son from church, but she knew the family the crazy old woman had sold her house to.  Remember, it was a 3 bedroom house, and she sold it to them for $100k.  They'd done a lot of work on the place, and more than doubled what it was worth.  After all that work, she decided she wanted her house back, and wouldn't pay a penny more than $100k.  After all, that's what she sold it for.  And she wouldn't take no for an answer.  She harassed that family for months or longer over them not selling it back to her.  \n\nI left that place place almost 9 years ago, and haven't seen her since, and I seriously hope I never do.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673403094.0},{"title":"The Two Minute Swim","author":"Jdawger_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/1080zlb\/the_two_minute_swim\/","text":"Like a good number of hotels these days, my hotel has a pool. It is on the smaller side and requires a separate key to enter (which you can \"check out\" at the desk for 1hr time slots (lots of reasons why we do this)). And like most hotels, it closes at 10pm.\n\nSince my afternoon shifts go until 11pm, if someone wants to use the pool sometime between 9pm and 10pm, I am reasonable and can close it down later. Point is, if you want to use the pool when it is near closing time, I don't mind keeping it open a little longer, so long as you are reasonable and pleasant.\n\nNot this person, however.\n\nThis past week, during one of my shifts, it was nearing 10pm, so I was getting ready to close down the pool and fitness center. It wasn't exactly 10pm, but it was no earlier than 9:55pm when I started going towards the pool to close it down. Nobody was in it nor did anybody use it that day. I entered with my master key, checked for dirty towels, and went towards the pool maintenance closet to turn the light off. Took about 2-3 minutes to do all that. \n\nAs I shut the door (which might I add is right next to the entrance door), I get startled by a mother with three children standing at the pool door knocking on the glass. \n\nI open the door, with the mindset they needed something from the front desk or needed a room. \"Hey there, is there something I can help you with, ma'am?\"\n\n\"We want to go swimming. Can you let us in?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but the pool is closed tonight. It reopens at 8:30am.\"\n\n\"C'mon. Why are you closing it early?\" The clock in the pool did state 9:58pm, so she is technically correct, but really? \n\nSide bar for a second: one of the many reason we close at 10pm is because the Front Desk needs to mop the entire pool floor at 10pm. That in itself can take about 15 minutes average; even longer depending on how much water splashes all over the place. We also disinfect all the chairs, tables, etc. because we live in a post-Covid world, so we have to take that stuff more seriously. Add on the five or so tasks and a money drop\/drawer count & the any check-ins that haven't arrived and you can be swamped for your last hour. I knew we had at least four people that haven't arrived yet that night.\n\n\"Again, the pool closes at 10pm. It is 10pm now. It will re-open at-\"\n\n\"Seriously?! We've been standing here for ten minutes. By the time you got here, we would've been done.\" Umm, no. I literally walked into the pool room no more than three minutes before you showed up, and I didn't have line of sight on the front door for 30 seconds max.\n\nI explained that I started closing the pool room no earlier than 9:55pm and didn't see them there. She said they went down an hour ago, but couldn't get in. I'm honestly surprised they missed the big \"See Front Desk for Pool Entry\" sign on the door. \n\nAt that point, I was done; I wasn't going to let them in. The door was closed & locked, so I said one more time that the pool closes at 10. Please come back in the morning before going back to the desk.\n\nShe started saying some of the usual pissed Karen stuff like \"I came here to swim and now we can't,\" \"I'm a shiny member,\" \"X hotel would let me swim,\" etc. I just ignored her and went back to the desk where she followed me. She eventually gave up when she knew she wasn't going to get her way and I wasn't going to argue back.\n\nThink she also gave the morning front desk some shit too because she was added to our DNR for \"we cannot accomidate\"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673326514.0},{"title":"No, sir, I don't need your notes or the nightstand Bible.","author":"garomena","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/10727f7\/no_sir_i_dont_need_your_notes_or_the_nightstand\/","text":"I've been working NA for an extended stay hotel.

Not looking for him to get kicked out (yet), but you bet I wanted documentation.\n\nWhy the eff would you think it's OK to go behind the desk at a workplace and read a notebook that isn't yours?

But I did and I told him I can't rent to him and he acted genuinely shocked and demanded to know why.\n\nThe last time I dealt with him I had to personally call PD to get him out because he had a woman in the room who called saying she was being sexually assaulted. The cops came and he wasn't arrested because the woman was high as can be and I guess deemed unreliable. I don't remember all the details but the lady was escorted off the property because she wasn't a registered guest. \n\nI called my GM at the time and was told to DNR him because in addition to all that they also smoked in the room. We also found drugs in the room after he left. He also left behind like 10 porno DVDs, of course that in itself isn't enough for a DNR but certainly added to the whole yuck\/seedy factor. My GM ran a search of his name and found out he's a registered sex offender.

It was around 3 AM when the doors opened (this was before I locked the doors), and a young man wanders in. He doesn't even see me at the front desk - he just strolls right in to the dark breakfast foyer. I am quite shocked by this. Did he just think he could walk by me and sit in the lobby? I ask him if I could help. He is spooked by me, but approaches the desk.\n\nHe explains he just got released from jail and needed a place to stay until our bus depot opened at around 6 AM. He is from Michigan and has nowhere to go. The poor dude looks no older than twenty or twenty-one years old, and his story tugs on my heart. I couldn't imagine being so far away from home so young. I tell him he can sit in the lobby until the guests arrive, but once people start coming down, he would have to leave. He thanks me, sits down, and falls asleep.\n\nThe breakfast attendant comes in at 4:45 AM on the week days. When she sees him, she is upset that I let a homeless man sleep in here. I explain his story and she just huffs and walks away, saying it isn't her problem. All I am going to say about her is that her license plate says MAGA, and she and I do not always get along. Anyways, she starts getting breakfast ready. While she does that, I grab a little goody bag and pack it with yogurt, eggs, milk, water, all the ready-packages goods for him. I assume he is beginning to wake up from the clamor of the hot pads.\n\nIt's a little passed 5 AM when a guest comes down to get coffee. The young man is asleep in the corner of the room, so I am not worried about it. But I do hear the old breakfast lady approach the guest and loudly state that I had let a homeless man in. She looks over to me, and I shake my head with disgust. Everyone had been minding their own business. The young man looks up and gathers his belongings, apologizing for being in the way. Before he heads out the door, I give him the bag of breakfast foods and apologize for her behavior. I figured I'd never see him again.\n\nExcept I did. When I was relieved by the AM shift at 7 AM and drove away, I saw him walking away from our competitor across the parking lot. I pulled over and said hi to him. He didn't recognize me at first, but after I explained who I was, he started crying. He thanked me for my generosity, and I apologized on my coworker's behalf. He told me after he left my hotel, he went across the street and was able to hang out in their lobby until now, when he was getting ready to travel to the bus depot. I wished him luck in his life and we parted ways.\n\nJust so you know, I did get in trouble for this. I didn't get written up, but I was told I put myself in danger. The few comments I get saying I'm heartless for turning homeless people away, this is the story why I don't let them stay. This young man was also not high off his rocker. I often wonder if he made it back home and turned his life around. I don't know what he did, but it's also not my business. I was just happy I was able to help someone who really needed it, and I don't regret it. I post a lot about what goes wrong on my shift, so I thought a good story would be good for the soul.\n\n\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673160188.0},{"title":"A drunk and his \u201cfemale friend\u201d stumble into a hotel","author":"WholesomePainal","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/106g6x0\/a_drunk_and_his_female_friend_stumble_into_a_hotel\/","text":"Hello all, long time lurker\/first time poster here.

I\u2019ve just been informed I\u2019ll be getting promoted here soon so on the precipice of that I have taken my job even more seriously so as not to ruin my chance at this promotion. \n\nNow onto the story at hand, I will do my best to recall the entire interaction as it happened 2 hrs ago. \n\n\nA drunk and his female friend stumble into the front door area of the hotel, we don\u2019t have a keycard slider for that door so the second entry door has to be manually opened by a button under the front desk. \n\nI let them in and ask what I can help them with knowing full well that I wasn\u2019t going to give them a room based of how they entered and the pungent odor of liquor wafting towards me as they approach my desk. \n\n\u201cNeed a room\u201d is all the guy says to me. \n\nTo which I reply \u201cSorry sir, it\u2019s after 3 am and we\u2019ve stopped doing walk-ins for the night\u201d \n\nDrunk: \u201cWhat are you even saying to me right now\u201d\n\nMyself: \u201cAs I just stated, we\u2019ve stopped doing walk-ins for the night, I have 0 arrivals listed so I know you don\u2019t have a reservation\u201d\n\n(Side note, I work in a city that has the nickname Little Detroit and have been routinely congratulated on how I handle guests at night as I don\u2019t take bullshit from anyone) \n\nDrunk: \u201cI know everyone that works here\u201d\n\nMyself: \u201cAnd as previously stated we do not do walk ins past 3 am, you do not have a reservation and as acting manager of this hotel I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave\u201d\n\nAt this point dude becomes belligerent, can\u2019t understand what he\u2019s attempting to say and I just stand there and stare him down. Eventually his \u201cfemale friend\u201d who has yet to say anything starts pulling him out the door as I smile and wave them goodbye. \n\nNow, normally this would\u2019ve been the highlight of my night but it just rubbed me the wrong way. Do these people actually think the \u201cI know your boss\u201d line works? Has it ever worked for any of them?","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673174205.0},{"title":"Man with a dog, and I'm confused...","author":"bloodyriz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/106fd0p\/man_with_a_dog_and_im_confused\/","text":"Ok first things first,  I am at a budget brand that is normally motels, but I am at an actual hotel, so no room doors on the outside of the building. We are fully pet friendly,  as in we don't even charge for an animal to stay, just mark it as a pet room, and move on with our lives.\n\nAlright,  so I go on my first property walk at around 11:30, and I see a car in our back lot with a rental moving trailer, the driver is inside the car, doing something on his phone. Ok, he could be there smoking, or not rented a room yet, and trying to make a reservation,  whatever, as long as he isn't sleeping not really something to worry about.\n\nI do another property walk at around midnight, and he is still there, so I make a note of the plate, and go look at our in house report. Sure enough,  the car is indeed registered to a room.\n\nNow at 1:00 I am back outside, and I see him sleeping in the car. So I knock on the window, and tell him he cannot sleep in the lot. He informs me he has a room, and I tell him that I am aware of this and that the room is where he needs to sleep. \"But I have a dog\" is his only reply. So naturally I tell him the dog is very welcome to go to the room with him, and then I head back to my walk.\n\nWhen I get inside, I look the room up, and sure enough it is marked as having a pet in it. So I watch the only 2 doors he could come in through, and nothing.

So I work at business hotel so we have a No Party Policy. It just says the maximum number of people in a room, how if we get too many complaints then they will be asked to leave and will not be refunded, and it says if anyone asks for a refund or anything due to the party, they will be financially responsible. Most people don\u2019t have a problem signing it because they will then keep it down since they are aware. \n\nWell, today first thing on my shift, my coworker is like hey, 324 is having a party. She tells me that the guest called and asked if the room was ready yet because she wanted to set it up for her son\u2019s birthday party, her words. My coworker told her the rooms not ready yet and we will reach out to her when it is, but we are a no party hotel so they will have to sign our policy when they check in. The guest then says they stay all the time and have never had to do that before and all this bullshit. When the guest arrived, my coworker couldn\u2019t find our policy so she let her go but told her I would find it and have her sign it. So I came in, showed my coworker where it\u2019s at and then called up to the room. I asked her to come down to the desk so we could have her sign it and she asks what she\u2019s signing. I read her what our policy says and she gets immediately angry and tells me how ridiculous it is and how she\u2019s never had to do this before and how she\u2019s not even having a party even though initially she told us she was, and then proceeds to slam down the phone. She comes down a few minutes later and tells me she want\u2019s corporates number and again tells me how ridiculous it is that she has to sign this and I told her unfortunately it\u2019s our policy, we can\u2019t change it. She tells me to look at her past reservations because she\u2019s \u201cstayed here a lot\u201d and when I did, she\u2019s stayed with us twice, four years ago. Like rules change, ownership changes. I tell her that if she doesn\u2019t cause a problem then nothing will happen, the policy is simply a precaution we take. She then says \u201cWell Im telling corporate that you and the other little bitch down here are taking advantage of me\u201d so I stopped her and said \u201cNo ma\u2019am you can be upset but do not call our staff anything like that.\u201d She then goes on her rant and everything, I gave her corporates number and she goes on her way.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later I get a call from customer support and he tells me that she is saying we were HARASSING HER! I immediately told him that no, she is having a party in one of our rooms and we asked her to come down and sign our no party policy. That is it. He even laughed and told me she wanted to speak to a manager and all that good stuff, we got it situated but I\u2019m so shocked she told him that we were harassing her.

Ok, not typical, usually you can just show your boarding pass... But whatever. Local rules are the law. That's why any sensible traveler has their cards in their wallet.  And dude... Germany! Need I say more?\n\nSo there's a guy two people in front of me trying to get into the lounge and he doesn't have his card. And low and behold, his boarding pass doesn't mention his status (lowest status on United as it became clear) and he is pissed. He's berating the poor girl working the line and making all sorts of absurd claims.  They finally punt him to the lounge to sort it out with actual Lufthansa staff. \n\nThe guy in front of me gives her his boarding pass with his Global Services card in hand, and apologizes profusely for his countryman, I them do the same with my lowly 1k card (ultra shiny, but not mega shiny like the guy in front of me) \n\nWe end up in the same elevator as dickhead and alternately give him shit for being a mean rude asshole. He's not having it and is getting ready to throw fists. \n\n*I should mention that the GS guy is like 6'3\" and built like a professional athlete. I'm about 6'and ok shape.  Dickslap... He's like 5'5\". So it's really rather funny as he's threatening us. \n\nWe get off the elevator and get in front of him to talk to the agents to let them know that there's no way that they should let this rude mean inconsiderate cuntmuffin into the lounge based on how he treated the girl downstairs. \n\nHe's now taking to another agent. Ours confirms who he is... Goes to talk quietly in the ear of that agent... She asks him to wait a moment as she needs to check something...\n\n\nThen like magic...a pair of security guards show up and make it exquisitely clear to our friend that he would not be entering ANY Lufthansa lounges, and that they would be reporting him to United... And that if he caused even the slightest commotion... He would not be traveling any further on a Lufthansa plane and would be forcefully exited from FRA. \n\nWatching him die inside was a thing of beauty.  The German efficiency at work was... #chefskiss \n\nI hope he learned a lesson. \n\nFor context, I've been in Germany, couldn't find my card (packed it in my damn suitcase) and boarding pass wasn't correct.

This was a day where I didn't lock the doors as fast as I should have. I now lock the doors immediately upon clocking in, but since so much had already happened that week, I thought to myself, *surely nothing else crazy would happen tonight.* I was wrong.\n\nI was minding my own business at the desk, printing papers to add to my audit packet. I had a few arrivals left, and my rule at the time was I would keep the doors unlocked until everyone had arrived. As I was waiting, I heard the doors open. I looked up to see a woman wearing three backpacks stumble in, avoiding eye contact with me. She tried to pass my desk, but I stopped her. If I know anything about drunk\/high people, it's that you can pretty much control them with a stern voice. Well, my gut told me this wasn't a guest. I have enough experience with homeless people to know she didn't belong on the property - the disheveled completion and the three crusty backpacks pretty much gave it away.\n\nI asked her what room she was going to, and she said she was meeting a friend somewhere on the second floor. She said she left her card key in the room with them. When prompted with an exact room number, she couldn't give one to me. I told her she couldn't just go and knock on everyone's door until she found her friend. This wasn't the first person to try and get by me to find their \"friend\" in the hotel. They can never give a right name or number, so I knew I caught her trying to sneak into the hotel. It beats me what they expect to do in here if I even let her into the hall. Anyways, I look up the name and room numbers she began rambling off. Eventually, I told her she couldn't be in here and had to leave. The lady asked if she could have a minute to call her friend, which I really didn't have a problem with. I told her she had a few minutes, so she sat on a couch and played with her phone. After a few minutes I heard her stand up and shuffle to the door, apologizing for everything. I told her I was sorry, but I can't let people into the hotel without a reservation. She left, I locked the doors behind her, and that was that.\n\nAbout forty-five minutes later, I hear the front doors open. I was shocked to see the woman in the red hoodie and three backpacks again. I had never seen a person show up twice before. She looked absolutely horrible this time around. There was no light in her eyes, she was jittery, and she honestly looked like she was coming off of something. She played with the card scanner a bit before I waved for her attention. I told her through the door that she needed a key to get in. I knew she didn't have a key. Plus, our key scanner doesn't work. But there was just no other way to tell her that she was not allowed in the building. We both knew she was not a guest. The lady dropped her three backpacks and rummaged through them, not looking at me. After three or four minutes, she zipped up her belongings and just left, not meeting my eyes. I never saw her again.\n\nI really wonder what homeless people think they're going to do in here. I work in a three-floor hotel with 60 rooms off of the interstate. There's really no place for them to camp in here that I won't see. I've been getting comments saying I should just let them in and I'm being mean, but they're all from people who don't work hotels. My responsibility is for the paying guests at my establishment, not for homeless people off the street. It sucks, and I feel terrible for them, but I also enjoy being able to pay my bills. I treat these people with respect, but they can not stay here. It is **literally the rules**. I am not going to go against my boss's orders to let a high woman walk the halls, knocking on people's doors.

This is more of a warning to our wonderful Night Auditors!\n\nAbout a year ago our sister Hotel's Night Auditor received a phone call from someone claiming to be the \"Owner\". In order to prove his legitimacy, the caller tells the Night Auditor that he's the one wearing a blue shirt. Our Owner does have cameras around the Hotels that he can view from his security station at home, so him knowing this makes some sense. The caller proceeds to tell this Night Auditor that he ordered a $1000s package but shipping was not paid for. In order to receive the package in the morning, shipping needs to be paid. The caller ordered the Night Auditor to get all the cash out of the cash drawer ... and the cash out from the safe in order to pay for the shipping cost. \n\nThe Night Auditor, for some reason or another, has access to the safe and takes the money out of both locations. The caller informs the Night Auditor that to pay this shipping cost he'll need to convert the cash to the Crytpocurrency Bitcoin. A location in order to do this is at least a 20 minute drive.\n\nThis may be where you expect red flags to go off, right? Well, no. The Night Auditor tells *Security* to watch the desk, he's \"going on a drive.\" He gets into his personal car and leaves the property with the cash on hand to convert it to crypto. During the run, the Caller insists a consistent phone call with the Night Auditor in order to ensure no hiccups occur.\n\nThis is when Security at least gets a bit curious. He calls my Hotel and speaks to our Night Auditor and gives him the rundown. Our Night Audit instantly recognizes it's a scam and informs Security.\n\nAfter an hour ... **an hour** ... the Night Auditor returns. The Night Auditor successfully converted the funds entirely to Crypto ... and gave the Crypto wallet to the Caller. Security tells the Night Auditor that he was informed from us that this is certainly a scam. This prompted a phone call between the two properties where my Night Auditor shared all the crazy scam phone calls he gets and hangs up on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me break this down a little further:\n\n* >!This Night Auditor was seasoned, and worked at the hotel for years!<\n* >!The Hotel had no change, no coins, no bills for the rest of the weekend until Monday!<\n* >!The Caller must have had visual sight of the Night Auditor in order to confirm his shirt color, which means he was right there in the area.

He was military, but that was about all I knew about them.\n\nLast night of their stay, the wife approached me at the front desk and asked in a low voice if I knew anyone who had xanax, benzos, or pain meds? She went on to explain that her husband was suffering a severe episode of PTSD, he was scaring her with his behavior, and she just wanted something to help him calm down. Apparently he has a medication he normally takes, but they left it on the dining room table when the left home.\n\nI was taken aback and couldn't think how to answer her request. I mean, obviously I can't give her someone else's prescription meds, but I just kind of froze, and than just told her I would talk to the assistant manager. Assistant manager had talked with the guest before and guest knows the assistant manager also has a vet husband, so I said maybe she would have some ideas.\n\nThe assistant manager mentioned that there is a veteran's hospital in the area with an urgent care and that the guest's best bet would be to take her husband there. I relayed this message to the guest and said that I didn't know of anyone who had a prescription, plus it's not legal to give someone else your prescription medication. The woman said her husband refused to go the clinic, and after that kind of let things go about the meds. She'd given me her cell # to communicate since she didn't want me calling the room for some reason, so I ended up texting back and forth with her until the end of my shift. Likely babysitting her through her own withdrawal episode, but idk for sure.\n\nI fully expect a certain percentage of guests will do illegal drugs in their hotel room, but I never expected anyone to directly solicit me at the front desk for over the counter medications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: The drugs she asked for were not over-the-counter.

The owners, though...","author":"Kwecks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/104bhb3\/dogs_love_them_the_owners_though\/","text":"A little disclaimer first: I run a bed and breakfast, so technically, I am owner, FDA, host, breakfast chef, handyperson, painter and - if push comes to shove - cleaner all rolled into one. \n\nAll things considered, we have lovely guests. Some bring stories and baggage nonetheless. Enter - let's call her - Sue stage left.\n\nSue is a regular - and quite lovely for having a chat and a laugh. Herself and her boyfriend plus two dogs (comparable to Spaniels in size) have been staying with us a few times a year and always insisted on paying full price to help us get on our feet. \n\nAnyway. This time, Sue + BF + 2 dogs booked themselves an apartment (bed, bath, kitchen, living room, balcony) for New Years, four days total. Because they're regulars, I told them I'd waive to dog fee as a thank you. Sue expressed her thanks and launched into a story how she doesn't understand why dogs always cost extra and per dog, despite two dogs arguably not being more work than one. Being a dog owner myself, I nodded along politely, but also said that as a guest I don't mind paying extra, since I know from experience how much extra work cleaning fur from furniture brings. Hence, we always cover Sofas and beds wirh extra throws when we know that dogs are coming and ask owners to please be mindful of our (new) furniture. Sue's turn to nod along politely. We had a glass of wine (which Sue insisted on paying) and caught up with what's new in our respective lives. Good times.\n\nFast forward three days, after check out. Sue left a tip and gave us all a hug before leaving. Since my cleaners are BOTH on sick leave for the next few days (FML), I grab a cleaning kit and enter Sue's apartment. \n\nMy jaw pretty much hit the floor.\nThe smell: clearly dog. Wet dog. Trash everywhere - on the floor, the kitchen counter, the balcony. One dog apparently threw up on the carpet + rug in the bed room, which they made some half-assed attempt to clean up. All my furniture covers are thrown off, dog hair and mud on every single piece - sofa, lounge chairs, throw pillows, bed, tables, window sills, kitchen counters... just everywhere! There are half chewed bones, candy wrappers, bottle caps, dog treats littering the floors. The dogs apparently peed into my balcony plants, too. Adding insult to injury, her BF apparently thought it okay to leave muddy hiking boot prints everywhere, including rugs, carpet and the bed. \n\nLong story short: yuk.\n\nIt usually takes me about an hour to clean these apartments and have them ready for the next guests. This one, and I am not lying, took me six hours. Deep cleaning rugs and carpets. Plucking hairs from furniture, surfaces - hell, even the kettle had dog hair stuck on the inside. Swiping, vacuuming and mopping yielded a FULL garbage bag of junk from the floors, balcony and counters alone. Aired everything out for hours in rainy weather to try and get rid of the smells. \n\nAt least the dogs didn't break anything. More's the pity, actually - Sue made a point of telling me that she has insurance and I'd love a new sofa and new lounge chairs (which were only six months old!) at this point. Not sure if I'll ever get rid of the smell completely.\n\nYup. Next time, Sue will be paying for both dogs in full. I'm thinking of adding an extra cleaning charge for BF, who apparently thought it okay to leave mud and beer caps everywhere. Despite everything, I can't bring myself to blacklist them. They are honestly nice folks. I just don't get how you get an apartment (that isn't yours) this dirty in just a few days. Uggggggh.\n\nAnyway. It's clean again now. Six smelly, dirty hours I'll never get back. My appreciation for HK and the craziness they face even here in our quaint corner of the world has risen quite a bit. \n\nExcuse me while I go finish that wine bottle. My insides need some deep cleaning, too.\n\nUPDATE: thanks for all your support (and outrage) on my behalf. It truly did me good (and gave me some much needed laughs). \nAfter wine, a shower and having slept on the matter, I decided to give Sue a call later this evening, once all guests have checked in for the werkend. Sue might not be a friend exactly, but she has been very supportive of us and our project here. Throughout lockdowns, renovations and storm damage we could always count on her (and her BF, to a lesser degree) to have a laugh with us, to pay in full and on time. Regardless of certain issues on our part (we're learning as we're going along - and took over an old building!), she would re-book time and time again, and I feel that I owe her some slack, too. They have literally payed thousands here already. I deeply value that as well as her belief in us, and would hate to lose her as a regular despite everything. Might update again, feeling hopeful. :-)\n\nUPDATE 2: \nSorry everyone, life happened - lots of work here. But I still owe you lovely folks an update on the Sue saga, so here goes ... spoiler alert: it's a happy one!! :-)\n\nSo, yes, I gave Sue a call! Luckily (for me) she left a book in the common room - which gave me a welcome excuse to call her. Well, the book was meant for our book exchange (as I already thought, but wanted to make sure). As was suggested by a few people here, I did raise the topic of the state of the apartment - but in a very gentle fashion. I started out by mentioning the furniture covers on the floor and that it gave me the welcome idea to buy new, stretchy ones that are harder for the dogs to pull off and which are much easier to clean.\n\nWhat can I say? She was extremely apologetic and offered to pay excess cleaning fees - or even the new furniture covers! This was all her, I hadn't even gotten around to asking her for anything at that point. \nShe also told me that she has been meaning to give me a call, but that she was super embarrassed over the state they left things in. She said she didn't want to make excuses, but apparently someone emptied the battery of the cordless vacuum we provide for guests (which checks out - the changes in weather have really affected that vacuum's battery life lately), so she couldn't pre-clean as she usually does before leaving. \n\nAdd to that one of her dogs getting ill (hence the throw up on the rug and the pee on the balcony) and they left in a bit more of a hurry than she would have liked. So yeah, luckily her dog - who is quite sweet actually - is fine again after a vet visit. After checking our account today, Sue actually transfered us 200\u20ac \"cleaning fees\" - I never specified an amount, but find it more than generous. She also promised to clean up before leaving next time and sounded truly embarassed. In turn, I offered a glass of wine and a laugh over it all when she comes back. I realize that probably doesn't sound very businesslike - but honestly, if I don't have a laugh and good times with the guests here, I might as well close down. Nobody in their right mind would run a B&B purely for business reasons in this economy.\nSo, yes, Sue and us, we're good. All's well that ends well!\n\nAlso: Thank you each and every one of you for your kind, encouraging, helpful and sometimes funny replies - I really appreciate them! I'll be ordering some stretch furniture covers now - and will ensure to only book Sue + dogs into our vinyl floored apartment in the future. :-)","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672955784.0},{"title":"My One-Month Night Audit Nightmare....","author":"OhanaUchiha","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/104ljvh\/my_onemonth_night_audit_nightmare\/","text":"Let me begin by saying that I should have looked at the immediate red flags before joining this god forsaken shit show. I will never, EVER, work for a hotel in my life or hell to heaven again. Here's my one month journey of the \"xxx Inn Full-Time Night Audit Position\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I am 24 and currently a junior pursuing a bachelors in computer science. I barely worked a job this past fall semester since I had 17 credits and the classes were fairly difficult. I wanted to get a job before Christmas so I can load up on some presents for the family, but I also had to study for finals in the meantime. I researched some easy going local jobs that will allocate some downtime hours to study. I also needed something that could work with my horrible sleep schedule of going to bed at 9am and waking up at 4-5pm. I then found the hotel \"night audit\" position which looked fantastic for me on the Indeed posting. Well boy, I have never been more wrong in my entire life.\n\nDuring the interview, I briefly met the two owners of the hotel in which I actually know one of them. Let's call her (the one I know, female mid 50's) F, and the other owner M (which is an old 70 year old man). I know the lady because she used to work at my high school, however everyone knew that she was bat-shit crazy. I've also heard horror stories of how she treated my friends parents that worked at a \"hotel\", but it was a story age's ago, and I thought she was just a guest there, not the fricken owner. Turns out that M was merely F's sugar daddy, because they go to my grandparents bar to gamble thousands every weekend there. The interview was pretty basic and I was practically hired on the spot for only 12am-8am full time night audit availability ONLY. The only question F asked me was \"would you be willing to pick up any hours\"? and I said maybe, depending on if someone is sick and they need someone to pick up for them. They told me I will start in a few days (Dec 13th was my first day), and will be training front desk 4pm-12am to understand Opera and to get the general gist of things.\n\nI was introduced to the two main managers, Y (younger manager), and O (older manager) during these training shifts and I did like them off the bat, and both were only a few months new to this particular hotel. Throughout my training shifts, I quickly learned how bad the turnover rate was at this hotel, and how the new O manager is a complete asshole to everyone by making everyone do more than what is required on the job posting. But to be fair, I didn't really care as I would be (or so I thought) the full time night auditor doing my own thing. So two weeks go by and it's been about 50\/50 night audit shifts and 4-12's which I was okay with. However the Y manager kept on expressing to not give in to pick up the 4-12's as he knew the other manager and owners pressured everyone to take them. I was also shocked that there were two other full-time night auditors, and only 3 workers for the 16 hour coverage of 8am-12am. So, definitely some red flags there. As my Y manager told me earlier to not give in to the 4-12 shifts, almost immediately after I was bombarded with those requests which I refused, however I would still be put up on the schedule for them. This pissed me off entirley, and I told the schedule guy to stop putting me on those shifts which he refused to listen.\n\nSo onto week three, it turned out that Y manager (the only dude I vibed with there) stole a shitload of money and now has a current warrant for his arrest. I was pretty fucking shocked since he was the only guy that trained me decently, and seemed to be the only one with common fucking sense at this place. So with him gone, the schedule guy didn't have to deal with him, which in turned gave him leverage to put me on more 4-12's. It's currently week 4, and for my \"full-time night audit position\", I am scheduled for this and next week combined of: two night audit shifts, and four 4-12's. Not only that, but the schedule guy tried to put me on the schedule for two 8am-4am shifts. I am absolutely done with this place, and I'm currently writing this on my laptop in the backroom because I won't even be giving my two week notice because practically everyone here can go fuck themselves. They recently admitted they want to move me to more 4-12's too because I'm the only \"competent worker\" they have. I am just in shock that they would post a full-time fucking Indeed listing for night audit, when they don't even want me to fucking work that position. It's bullshit. Absolute bullshit.\n\nALSO, the schedule guy promised to have another front desk worker to be with me today because we have a sold out hotel for a dance competition, but then they gave me the lame excuse that his fucking tooth hurt??? What?? So I was left alone with less than a month's experience to deal with 130 rooms of people, in which there was a problem with over fucking half of their credit cards. I was so in a rush that I gave a 10-room block a entirely different group of room keys for different  block which luckily we found out soon enough since the one I gave them originally was a 15-room block so they had to many room cards.\n\nI really want to walk off after this shift, which I might and block all of their numbers because I really don't owe them jack shit. However my moral standings are telling me no, and just to finish the rest of the shifts. This front desk job stresses me tf out, since our O manager and schedule guy seems like they have full blown sales ADHD and it's hard to be trained when they are explaining everything 100 million miles per fucking hour.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1672981943.0},{"title":"Do You Want a Cookie???","author":"crabdancer64","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/103u12x\/do_you_want_a_cookie\/","text":"My hotel does not rent to locals. For anyone who doesn't know what a local is, it's basically a grouping term to refer to homeless, addicts, and partiers. I mean, it makes sense. Why would you book a room in the city you live in? And, yes, we do rent to certain circumstances, like frozen pipes and burnt down houses. But if your ID says (my city), I'll send you across the street to our competition. Sometimes I turn away good people, but most of the time, it appears like I dodge a bullet.\n\nWell, a month ago, I got a new coworker, who I really cannot stand. She claims she has ten years of hotel bizz under her belt, but I am always having to fix her mistakes. She even claimed our boss loved her and was going to make her manager, when in reality, he sent her to work at our hotel because he can't stand to even look at her (my boss actually *owns* the hotel).\n\nWhen I clocked in, all seemed well. She is PM and I am NA. She said I had one last reservation to check in and left. I ended up checking the family in. It was, like, six people going in to one room. One of the boys asked where my coworker was. I was surprised to hear that they knew her and told him that she left maybe fifteen minutes ago. They were pretty weird people, but my coworker is really weird, so I didn't think too much of it.\n\nAll was quiet for an hour or so when the man with the family left for a little bit. When he came back, he struck up a conversation with me. He told me he had just dropped dinner off with my coworker because she was too lazy to make a meal herself and he is such a nice guy and people like to take advantage of him. He eventually went on and told me a sob story about woe is him and such and people take advantage of his kind heart. I indulged him with sympathy, but eventually, it got too much. I didn't know how to dismiss myself from the conversation, so I just endured it. He eventually told me where he lived, which was in my city! This piqued my interest because it meant someone checked in a local. I made note of it while he spoke to me. This was just another case of my coworker breaking the rules to do whatever she wanted. It wasn't the biggest deal, but my manager still wanted to know about, since the night or two before was when that [man threatened me with gang violence.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zy2fa7\/threatened_with_gang_violence\/)\n\nI really wanted to get back to my Wikipedia spiral of Disney movies, but the man just wouldn't leave. Eventually, the conversation turned weird. He started asking where I lived and if he could come and hang out with me after work. Mind you, I'm a female in my twenties, and he was a male in his forties. I have a feeling he was downplaying his age, because there was no way he was my parents' ages. He *had* to have been in his mid-sixties. Before I could really react and tell him I was not interested in hanging out with someone at least twice my age, the conversation turned dark. He began to reiterate how good of a guy he is and how people take advantage of his generosity, but he really was such a good guy. He was so good, that he has taken drunk women to their homes and not r\\*ped them. That made my stomach sink. He thinks he's such a great guy because he doesn't r\\*pe women, especially when they're intoxicated? What, do you want a cookie???\n\nI stood up and dismissed myself, telling him I had laundry to do in the back room. He didn't understand how the conversation turned hostile, shrugged, and went back to the room he was sharing with his friend. It wasn't even his wife - it was a friend he claimed was taking advantage of his generosity. I hid in the back office for a bit, watching the cameras so I didn't have to talk to him again. After an eternity, I went back out, and sure enough, he strolled back to my desk. He must have been waiting for me. He past me outside to smoke another cigarette, joking that he must be making my boyfriend jealous. Uh, no. I wrote down in our pass-on log what happened, and texted my boss the entire interaction that had occurred. He walked back and forth from my desk a few more times that night, but I didn't give him the time of day, and he got bored of me. I went into that room's folio and saw that my coworker had even given them a discount. It left a bad taste in my mouth, since the guy told me he \"actively scams the government of financial aid\". His words, not mine.\n\nMy manager was pissed that the whole thing had even happened. It could have all been prevented if my coworker had not let them in and broken the rules. It really was my first experience of the whole \"woe is me, good guys finish last\", and I was not impressed. I don't know how my manager took care of the whole thing, but it hasn't made me like my coworker any more than I hadn't. I mean, what did he expect me to do, tell him what a great guy he was for not ruining women's lives? **FFS**\n\n\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1672908078.0},{"title":"Guest is being rude, suddenly switches gears and starts flirting","author":"Master_Kura","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/103j3n1\/guest_is_being_rude_suddenly_switches_gears_and\/","text":"Had a guy checking in who was being a typical \"Karen.\" Complaining about our rates (they're quite cheap), saying the owner gave him a better deal, very unwilling to give me his ID.

Obviously, this caused issues with us as we would come close to running out of spaces for our actual guests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, management had the idea to having a boot company patrol the parking lot at night and any vehicle that didn't have a parking pass was subject to be booted at the tune of $125. Now, in my city, we had to have a sign clearly posted and clearly stating parking was for guests and what would happen to unauthorized vehicles If the person didn't read the sign, that's on them. It just couldn't be obscure or anything like that. Now if it was found out that the car belonged to a guest or a visitor of a guest, we'd have the booting company remove the boot at no charge.

We're both grown men, so let's try this again\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTaken aback by my response, but undeterred, he stated, \"Why are y'all putting boots on people's cars?!\"\n\n\"Are you a guest here sir?\"\n\n\"No, but why does that matter?\"\n\n\"Are you visiting a guest here sir?\"\n\n\"No, but that's not important!\"\n\n\"Actually, because this is private property and you're not a guest, you're not authorized to park here. So that's why the boot is on your car.\"\n\n\"I'm not paying it.\"\n\n\"That's your choice, sir\"\n\n\"So what are you going to do about it?!!\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing. You weren't authorized to park here.\"\n\n\"The concierge at the apartment complex said that it was ok.\" (Which I knew was a lie from previous conversations with a few of them)\n\n\"Well, the concierge doesn't work for the hotel, so if she gave you incorrect information you may want to speak with her\"\n\n\"You need to call the boot company to fix this!\"\n\n\"Sir, you have the boot company's information in your hand, but as far as getting it removed, that's between you and them since you're not a guest.\"\n\n\"This is illegal. I'm calling the police.\"\n\n\"Okay sir, you have a good night.\"\n\nHe actually did call the cops....and they told him the EXACT same thing that I did! \n\nSo about 45 minutes after that, the boot guy comes in laughing. He's saying that the guy was talking cash shyt the entire time he was removing the boot. Taking about suing the hotel, the police department, and me personally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSurprisingly, that lawsuit never happened!","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1672892017.0},{"title":"Drunk lady demands what she already has","author":"toadTHEBlTCHdette","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/1036ldh\/drunk_lady_demands_what_she_already_has\/","text":"We have a guest who\u2019s been in house for about 6 days and her check out date is tomorrow (by tomorrow I mean this morning a la hotel time).

I tried contacting her and couldn't reach her. I pressed a button that gives the guest with some time to provide valid payment details or the reservation would be cancelled. Her Dec 25 - Dec 27 Platform reservation was subsequently cancelled.\n\nA day later on Dec 26, my coworker shows up at that property to accommodate other guests in Room 3. He observers there is no key in the outside of the door (where we leave it for after-hours telephone reception), so with the arriving guests standing behind him, he opens the door to see if the key was on the other side of the door.\n\nAs he opens the door, a barking husky rushes toward him, he promptly close the door. We scramble to find out who was accommodated in Room 3. It occurs to us that perhaps Ms. LV has accommodated herself in Room 3, we contact her and find out this is the case. We take payment from her via a new direct reservation that we entered into our PMS on the fly since her Platform reservation was cancelled in the system. (Still need to ask, but I assume she had the two keycodes to enter the main premises from a templated arrival day email. We do send these, I don't know if she got one).\n\nOn the Dec 27, Ms. LV states she is going to be back in our town from Dec 28 - Jan 1, and wants to make a second reservation with us for those dates. Around the time of her second arrival we attempt to charge her card and it was rejected. We didn't consider it too much of an issue as she had paid for most of her prior stay when the same thing had happened. On the Dec 29 she informs us that  the problem with her credit card has been resolved. But the card still does not work and we get no response from her on Dec 31.\n\nOn Jan 1, past our 11AM checkout time, our property manager (PM) and one of my coworkers are at the property where Ms. LV is staying. PM opens the door to see if Ms. LV has left. Some of her items are in the room . PM suspects she may attempt to leave without paying. So they collect some of Ms. LV's items so that it is less easy for her leave without paying.\n\nMs. LV comes back, and we ask her to pay. She goes into her room, and when she does not see her items, she begins repeating \"Where are my items\". We try to inform her that we have her items as it is passed checkout time, and we will provide them to her as soon as she pays for her stay. She is not having it, and in a panic demands to know where her items are. We show her where the items are, to prove to her that we have them, but we insist that she pays before taking them. She grabs her items, and starts heading for the front door. Our property manager calls the police, and stands in front of the front door as she informs LV to wait for the police.\n\nA scuffle breaks out, where Ms. LV attempts to shove our property manager aside. After a few contacts, our property manager's elbow is bruised by Ms. LV. Fortunately, two other male guests come and detach Ms. LV from our property manager, and she stops attempting to leave.\n\nThe police arrive and take note of her ID, telling her she must pay within 24 hours, and let her go. Our property manager states she has bruises on her elbow, to which Ms. LV says that her \\[body part\\] hurts after the incident.\n\nOn the evening of Jan 1, LV sends us a message saying that we have injured her \\[body part\\] and owe her money. We respond by providing her bank-transfer details to send us a payment for her stay.\n\nOn Jan 2, we get a customer complaint from Platform regarding her Dec 25 - Dec 27 reservation which was cancelled due to invalid payment details, stating that LV has an injury. **Through her previously cancelled reservation, Ms. LV is attempting to get Platform to extract money from us for her a second reservation she made by a direct reservation after she left without paying.**\n\nAnd Ms. LV then SMSed us:\n\n>Hello, I have informed Platform about the dispute and am awaiting a response. I think Platform will contact you. You owe me money on my \\[body part\\], I'm at the doctor's.\n\nOur property manager immediately went to the Police station to put in a sworn affidavit, along with informing them that Ms. LV has not paid after the 24 hour period.

My story happened almost exactly 29 years ago, and there are three parts (so this will be very l-o-n-g).  My bride and I (we're 'mericans) were honeymooning in stunning, wonderful, friendly New Zealand.  We had an itinerary that--while it allowed for some variations--was pretty specific.  We had a week to explore the North Island and a week to do the South.  As much as possible, we tried to book our rooms in advance.\n\nThe places we stayed ranged from quaint to typical motel to comfy\/homey to tres-chic-moderne-pricey.  We saw marvelous and strange things, and almost mastered driving on the left side of the road.  Our trip down the west coast of the South Island (rugged, stunning, sparse) ran into a slight problem, though, when the *worst rainstorms in 40 years* struck!  Being from New Orleans (bad weather is our middle name) we blithely drove along, even as the radio announced highways being washed away and numerous \"slips.\"  \"Yeah, so?\" we thought, \"it's just a little rain; some people are *bound* to slip a bit!\"  Oh, ye ignorant sods--they're talking about *landslides*!\n\nWellll...things came to a head when we learned that the route we intended to take was now, essentially, just a memory on a map.  Whole bridges had washed out and the aforementioned slips had blocked the highway. Meanwhile, it was getting dark, signs of civilization were few, and, wow, the rain really *was* coming down!  Through the gloom, *there*, gleaming like a beacon in the apocalypse, was the Hari Hari Motor Inn!\n\nNow Hari Hari's place in history was secured when the first aviator to fly from Australia to New Zealand crashed landed there, but for us, the Hari Hari Motor Inn was simply a godsend.  Yes, they had just ONE room left (alas, two single beds--soooo romantic), but the pub served food and we were safe from the storm.  We ordered fried chicken (thinking good ol' crispy southern U.S. chicken) and were surprised when we were served a *whole* chicken deep-fried (sans breading) and presented in a brown paper bag with a plethora of fries--uh, sorry--*chips*!  It was delicious!\n\nBut another thing stood out about our stay.  A busload of German tourists were also stranded at the Inn, one of whom was demanding of the front desk attendant that they be allowed to continue their journey, despite the bridges being out and the main highway washed away.  To his reasoning, the roads should be methodically cleared and the bridges rebuilt so that he and his party could be on their way.  This is in no way an observation about Germans in particular (my countrymen tend to think yelling in English is the same as speaking a foreign language), but it was nonetheless satisfying to watch the front desk folks maintain their cool as the Teutonic Tourist played out his stereotype.\n\nIt became evident that if we were going to make our reservations in Christchurch, we would have to backtrack and take a different highway through the mountains to get to the east side of the island.  The next day we drove through more spectacular and rugged scenery, saw more sheep than humans, and avoided all the slips.  We arrived at our lodgings (a sprawling two-story motel complex) none the worse for wear, only to learn that--despite our confirmation--we had no reservation for that night.  To complicate matters, the facility was heavily booked because of a youth cricket tournament.\n\nLike the very people I used to wait on (and complain about), I yelled, claimed outrage, and grew red in the face.  I went on and on about the brutal weather we had been through and the torturous drive through the rugged mountains, and how utterly irresponsible the facility was for not honoring the *confirmed* reservation I had booked *months* ago!  I sputtered and flustered and all but stamped by feet until the front desk agent calmly said, \"Sir, we DO have your reservation for Wednesday night; this is Tuesday.\"  I was mortified!  I had become *that* guy!  Through the storm and the blocked highway and the naked fried chicken in a bag, we had misplaced a day!  I sheepishly mumbled an apology and the clerk offered us a very nice suite for the night.  I am sure he had a story to tell about the stupid American who couldn't read a calendar.\n\nMy third mini-tale concerns a hotel in Arrowtown, a community near Queenstown.  Queenstown was (is) a fun place with a beautiful lake, soaring mountains, and a pleasant vibe.  During the winter, it's a skier's paradise, but we were there in January (NZ summer).  We had a blast riding the luge down the mountain, even without the snow.  The sky was filled with paraponters, their colorful sails punctuating the achingly blue sky.  What does this have to do with Arrowtown?  Nothing.  Sorry.\n\nWe noticed that the Arrowtown sported a pub called the New Orleans Hotel.  We *had* to go visit!  I mean, there's no sense in going halfway around the world and not seeing a facility named after one's hometown, right?  Well, the New Orleans Hotel was a pub straight out of the movies and the barflies straight out of central casting.  I strode up to the bar and when the bartender asked what I wanted, I proudly proclaimed \"I'm from New Orleans!\"  To this the barkeep looked me in the eye and said:  \"So?\"\n\nSo.

When they originally arrived at the hotel, they were a walk-in 7-night reservation, and then extended for 9 more nights on their original departure date. I work at an extended-stay property, so the standard procedure is to charge 7-night payments each week for extended-stay guests (stays over 10 nights) so they don't have to pay in one large sum. \n\nToday, this specific guest was due for weekly payment, but only for the amount of 2 nights since they are departing on Wednesday and have paid through Sunday night.  When I tried to take the payment on the card on file, it declined, so I had to ask the guest to come to the front desk to pay. I could not get ahold of them via the room or cell phone, and the room was vacant when I knocked, so I locked their keys out to so they would have to come to speak with me. This is how it went:\n\nGuest: The guy who I made my reservation with took my payment already, why do you need more money from me?\n\nMe: We have taken two payments from you so far, each of them was for the amount of 7 nights, and today you owe a payment for the last two nights of your stay which will be for tonight and tomorrow night.\n\nGuest: The guy never told me that. You should be able to see that I already paid.\n\nMe: You have paid, but only for 14 nights, and you are booked for 16 nights. I can print out the folio for you to show exactly what charges we have made on your card.\n\n\\*I printed out his full folio, highlighted the two payments that were made on his card, and physically wrote out the math that showed that the total cost of the stay and the amount he has paid were not the same, meaning he does in fact owe us money. He took the folio, didn't even look at it, and just continued to argue with me. \n\nGuest: I still don't understand. When I extended my stay last week they didn't tell me I would have to pay again.\n\n\\*We explain the payment schedule to every extended stay guest at check-in. When he came to extend for the 9 additional nights, my AGM handled it and I watched him explain that his card was being run for the next 7 nights, not the rest of the stay. \n\nMe: I apologize for any miscommunication regarding the payment schedule, however, when you extended the room you should have anticipated paying the full amount for the nights you planned to stay. \n\nIn hindsight, this comment may have been a bit pushy but I was fed up with explaining the same thing 10+ times when nothing was going to change.

I show up on Saturday, the night auditor says:  \"The fire alarm panel keeps sounding, but the Alarm never sounds in the building.\" The fire panel shows the laundry utility room as the source. \"Okay, so maybe the utility room is just overheating?\"  I prop open the utility room door so it'll cool down.  About an hour into my shift, The fire alarm just goes off without the pre-alarm sounding.  The utility room is the cause, I figure oh it just got to hot in there, I shut off the fire alarm.  Fire dispatch calls, I tell them it was a false alarm and that out utility room is simply overheating.  This happens four-ish more times;  after which fire dispatch calls again.  At this point I think, somethings not right....\n\nI go into the utility room just to make sure that there isn't actually a fire.  And prop a fan into the utility room to hopefully cool it down in there.  Thankfully the fire alarm stops for the rest of my shift.I finish my shift with some slightly annoyed guests about the fire alarm over and over.  I apologize and say that our laundry room utility room was overheating causing the false alarms.Fast foreword  to Sunday morning.  The Saturday night auditor says that the fire marshal showed up because something was very wrong with all of the alarms in such a small timeframe.Turns out that the utility room was filling with natural gas!  The fire marshal said, \"We were basically turning our utility room into an explosive and it was a miracle that it didn't explode.  At this point I'm thinking that our housekeepers should have smelled it and said something, but all of the gas was collected in the utility room.The Saturday night evening shift said that during his shift, the hot water stopped working because the gas was shut off (obviously).The Saturday night auditor was on the phone with corporate and the property manager to figure out a compensation for the guests.  Of course there are some people that don't think 25% off is acceptable compensation for no hot water.  We call an affiliated property up the street to see if they have rooms for our guests that want a shower, or to relocate.  Some guests choose to go have the shower at the other property, others just get mad.  Only one agreed to relocate.\n\nDeparture time Sunday, Our laundry room is unusable because we have no hot water; so the boss lady sends all of our housekeepers to the sister property to help with their housekeeping and the rooms they set aside for our guests to use the showers.  Some people are understanding of the situation and take the 25% off happy to have had a bed.  Others, not so much.  I can recall one guy saying that he will be all over social media talking trash about our property and how we didn't do enough to rectify the situation.  He throws his room keys at me while yelling \"We will never stay here again!\"  Sunday is busy and stressful, but nothing to stupid.  Just justifiably annoyed guests.  Our Maintenance guy was there attempting to get the leak fixedI have to put all of the departure rooms out of order because our housekeepers were up the street.  Fortunately we had enough vacant ready rooms for that nights arrivals (there were only like three or four).\n\nMonday morning now, I show up at 7:00. I take half of the previous days out of order back in, bringing the total unclean rooms to about fifty.  Our maintenance guy and the plumber are there bright and early  The boss tells me to tell the housekeepers to do what they can and put what they can't out of order again.  Also to not accept any walk-ins just the arrivals that are already in the list for tonight.  Currently there are about twenty rooms out of order because they didn't get cleaned.  100% of the phone calls are grievances about the previous weekend.  I explain that our GM and property owner agreed that 25% was all that we can\/are going to offer.  Most people accept this.  I am relieved to have the next three days off!\\[\/rant\\]\n\nOne last small story.  This guy departed Saturday before all of the stupidity started, he calls on Monday and leads with, \"Why didn't I get my incidental fee back yet?!\" He is irate.  I try to calm him down by saying, \"Sir, the incidental fee usually takes three to five business days to finish processing.\"  He says, \"That isn't fast enough, I'm going to sue you!\"  I think to myself, 'really? You're going to spend thousands on a lawyer and court fees over TWENTY DOLLARS!?'   I say to him that if the money hasn't released to his account by Thursday at the latest to call us and we will email his bank to release the funds (basic stuff).   But no, he is adamant on taking us to court over twenty dollars!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: our property didn't blow up because of a gas leak, and no one was happy about our compensation option or handling of the situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

I had my shift as a cashier at the museum where I sell both tickets and gifts. When visitors enter the museum, they have to walk across the lobby to me. Out of nowhere, a large group of ca. fifty people arrived. They were foreign tourists. Their guide, a direct elderly woman, came up to me and asked about the restrooms so I showed her the way. Soon two lines formed in front of them.\n\nI thought that they just really needed to use the restrooms before entering the museum. That wasn't the case. The guide returned to me and revealed that they were actually on their way to the Christmas markets and only needed to use the restrooms. She was told somewhere that we have free toilets for everyone. We don't, albeit we sometimes semi-tolerate when non-visitors do this. They had no idea that there were the restrooms at the markets, or that their bus was actually parked right next to the large mall (which has free restrooms). I don't know how they could've missed it. Communication was a little difficult, as these tourists came from abroad. Luckily, their mother tongue was similar to the one used in this country.\n\nWhile I was talking to the guide, half of the tourists entered the first exhibition which is on the ground floor. The only guy working in there was rightfully horrified, as always when a huge group arrives. At this point, I had to call the shift manager to sort things out. Using the restrooms is one thing, entering the exhibition without paying for the tickets is another. The guide apparently had no idea about this either and just kept repeating that this would never happen again. She sent most of the tourists outside, but some remained at the exhibition. I had to kick them out myself. They couldn't really understand me, so I think they mainly left because I sounded angry. Anyway, it finally worked and everyone from that group left the building.\n\nSo yeah, this happened. The management knows about it, but I'm not sure whether they will do anything. Not that much can be done. One employee against fifty tourists and one guide who come without a warning to use our restrooms and then enter the exhibition without paying. Luckily, we didn't get a shitty Google review as a result.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1672689005.0},{"title":"Camp in the lobby?

Betore this, I've worked many hospitality jobs, but this is my first time in a hotel. So far I've encountered all sorts of people, some annoying, some lovely, but these people today really pushed my buttons.\n\nThe check in time for our hotel is 3pm. When people arrive early, we tell them we cannot guarantee anything before that time. Today, that was especially true. We are dreadfully understaffed, most relevantly in housekeeping. This morning, we had 108 checkouts. Throw those together, along with entitled guests, and you have a disaster just waiting to happen \n\nThree different couples all arrived at 7am, wanting to check in to their room. I give them the whole spiel about not being able to guarantee them anything before 3pm. Not to mention, the room type they booked still have people in them. I offer to store their luggage, they accept, and go to have some coffee in a slightly miffed mood. This is fairly normal, and people are usually nice about it.\n\nThree hours later, at 10am, they return, asking for updates on their rooms. I tell them the same message, and offer some suggestions for what they can do in the city. I say I'll give them a call if their room is ready. All six of the decide this is too stressful, and decide to calp in the lobby.\n\nFor five hours.\n\nUntil 3pm.\n\nObviously, they didn't think they would have to wait until 3pm. Of they're there, obviously we can magically clean a room for them. Alas, this was not the case, as I had told them, thrice now.\n\nAs the hours passed, they gave me dirty look after dirty look. I gave them updates. The terrible tango continued until 2pm, when one of them, a man, approached the front desk. I could tell from the look on his face that he was disappointed. What follows is a direct quote of the conversation we had.\n\n\"I just wanted to say, we've travelled extensively, and would really appreciate a room.\"\n\nI tapped my fingers on the desk. \"Yes, sir, I understand, but we don't currently have any rooms available, as I've told you before. I will check you in as soon as I have rooms ready for you.\"\n\n\"We've been travelling for eight years, and usually hotels are able to put us in a room if we arrive early, or change our assigned room. This has never happened before.'\n\n\"Sir, I understand, and when we have any rooms available at all, you will be the first to know.\"\n\n\"Y'know, in a situation like this, you need to employ something called crisis management. It's called prioritizing those who come first.\"\n\nHe then walks off, and all I can think is: 'You deciding to sit in the lobby is hardly a crisis.'\n\nAt 3pm, like I told him, their rooms were ready. I check them in without further incident, though they give me the stink eye the entire time. I'm clocking out by this point, so I leave and never want to think about them again. \n\nI know it's nothing major, but these entitled fucks got on my nerves so much I just had to share.\n\nLet us all rejoice that New Years is nearly over.\n\nEDIT: I feel I should clarify that all six of them were together, just in different rooms. All of them came to ask for updates every half an hour, which is okay in itself, I don't mind that. It was the way they talked down to me, gave me dirty looks whenever I did anything, and then how the man came up later. It wasn't just one couple. \n\nWe genuinely didn't have any rooms ready, which is an anomaly for us. Usually we could check them in, but we were very understaffed. I wish I could magically make rooms ready, but I was in constant contact with the housekeepers trying to get updates for them, and trying to get them a room.

She called dispatch but sometimes on busy nights we're lucky if cops show up for normal service calls so yeah. Tonight is busy and we're like 85% full with numerous late arrivals so are basically sold out (we're holding a block of rooms just in case). \n\nMy first hour is relatively quiet and I began making a round of the property near midnight partly because I wanted to watch the fireworks display for a bit from a casino located about 6 miles or so from our hotel. They're in an unincorporated part of town but their display is like a 4th of July display and therefore neat and loud.\n\nI get to the top just as it hits midnight and that's when the real barrage begins. We are a few blocks from a large residential are and they're lighting off fireworks as well. I had a view of our front entrance so I'm keeping an eye on that incase anyone pulls in.

I assured them that no one was doing fireworks on the property and that we are close to a residential neighborhood and a large casino and people were lighting off fireworks. \"Well do something about it!\" \n\nThe fireworks noise was tapering off by that point so I asked my GM what I should do and she said just note the complaints she will deal with them personally in the morning. She told me not to offer a discount for that specific reason as it is out of our control. I got several more calls about the same issue and some asked for a refund and I told them what I was told. Maybe I'm being cynical but I think the owners dispatched the GM here to make sure we don't lose any money of the last day of the year when out rates go way up. \n\nMy GM told me to do another round of the property to check for noise and as I was doing that a large number of the late arrivals showed up and they apparently came from a party somewhere and were all a bit tipsy. They booked late so were scattered throughout the hotel. I got to the FD as my GM was checking them in so helped her with that. She told me I got a number of complaints from earlier for my tone\/indifference\/incompetence but she was there so knows that's not true. However, if they go the corporate route who knows. Great, off to a good start for the new year.\n\nMy GM radios me and tells me to call her on one of the floor phones and she says some of the late arrivals are trying to congregate in a room and told me to go break it up as its well after our no loud noise cutoff.

This shirtless drunk\/high guy is yelling the F word at the top of his lungs and trying to fight everyone else on the street...and there are dozens. I don't bother to call the cops; I'm sure someone else will. He's not doing anything too outrageous and I like to save my cop calls for when I *really* need them.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes into all this, the guy steps out into traffic and starts yelling at all the cars. A shopkeeper next door (who was open surprisingly late!) tells me he called the cops and they should be here any minute. I shrug--doesn't affect me, really!\n\nTen minutes later, another drunk takes the first guy up on his offer to fight and they scuffle for a few minutes. By now a huge crowd of gawkers has stopped to watch along the street. It's not turning ugly or anything; they're all just drunk and being entertained as this wacko goes bananas in the middle of the street and traffic is stopped everywhere!\n\nAnd then, after a good thirty minutes of his bullshit....the guy *wanders over to our hotel* and plops down on the steps to put his freaking shirt on! I internally start freaking out because OF COURSE I KNOW WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN and, sure enough, sirens and three cop cars come tearing down the street and now, to subsequent passersby, EVERYTHING looks like it happened at the hotel! I was so pissed! It had absolutely nothing to do with our property or our guests, but now we look like the redneck troublemakers to the entire entertainment district. Figures he had to drunkenly wander onto our property three seconds before the police showed up!

Well tonight we have probably 10 guests, that mind you have been here for about 4 hours now and I have already had to ask them to quiet down, that are wanting to stay in our dining\/den area until the ball drops. I told them that our policy is quiet hours at 10pm so unfortunately they can\u2019t stay out here. They were very upset and said how a couple years ago they could and it was no problem.

Last night; He checks in and pays with cash and is from a town 45 minutes away. \n\nLast night, A woman comes in which reportedly is a homeless woman in the area and gives us a Christmas card addressed to the staff saying that she used to work here. I haven't been here too long about 3 months so I don't know to believe or not. Anyways she wanders around and ends up knocking on his door (the only one she tried) and he let her in. Then he comes down saying he's uncomfortable with her in the room and wants to know if he can be moved to another room. He gets moved but we don't know if the woman left or not since there are side doors we don't check. He's supposed to leave tommorow so we will see.\n\nFlash forward to my shift today, I notice a man (didn't know what he looked like) walking around lobby for an hour. I normally watch tv or something behind a wall so I don't know if he walked in or something. Anyways he finally goes and buys a coke from our convenience store and I try to figure if he's a guest. One red flag is he had a huge wad of cash he used to pay for, won't count against him because I've seen many people like that you I'm pretty sure are just normal families who prefer cash. Anyways I ask him how his stay is going and he says good and I ask if I can get him anything to which he responds \"if the feds would listen to me instead of just ignoring me\" to which I respond \" I'm sorry I dont think we have their number\" kinda sarcastically and he walks off. I text my coworker his description and she confirms it is who he is\n\nFinally, a normal family comes up to me and gives me a phone they found in the parking lot. I think it's a burner phone like the ones at the grocery because it has the little plastic fake display that you peel off the screen when you buy a phone. Anyways I'm charging it up because if I'm wrong and it's just someone's phone maybe the Lock Screen can help me indenting who's it is. \n\nDefinitely an exciting night and will keep updated.

He says for him to call the sheriffs office of his hometown\n\nUpdate 2: so I didn't see him past the buying of the bottle of coke and turns out he got arrested for the night for possession of meth and there's gonna be further investigations for more serious charges. The housekeepers told us that when they went in the room the phone, tv, air conditioning unit, lamps, anything that could be unplugged was. The bed was pushed from the wall to the middle of the room as well. The woman turned out to know the dude and dropped off a Walmart bag of important papers that were in his car. He apparently got released after the night and was waiting past check out for his buddy to pick him up but then left out the side door before he could come pick him up and the dude picking him up didn't know that so he drove back home.\n\nClarification; to clear up about the woman the night before, I heard the story wrong and she may have stayed the night in the room but was not in the room past breakfast as we deactivated the key cards when she was out of the room.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1672537579.0},{"title":"Adult man tells his mommy on me, then hits me up on a dating app","author":"Fd-soothsayer_24","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zzpfgs\/adult_man_tells_his_mommy_on_me_then_hits_me_up\/","text":"I had a lady come down asking for my assistance in her room due to a disagreement between herself and her boyfriend.

But due to the fact that we are evacuating the building, we are most definitely not going to be able to get you a key until the fire department clears us to let people back in.

They congratulated us and made a very tiring night into one I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nOf course, I left a note with the manager about the outstanding service.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672448858.0},{"title":"Entitled Hotel Karens","author":"Devils_Priest666","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zzb7nl\/entitled_hotel_karens\/","text":"So, I work the graveyard shift as a security guard for a small private company, and one of the places I have worked security for was at two hotels. One thing I do while I am at work is to try to do is be respectful and give someone the benefit of the doubt, especially when there is supposedly only one witness to something going on. I also try and be as respectful as I can be, even when the person or people I am dealing with are being uncooperative and belligerent.  \n\nOne of the things I do when I first get on shift is to talk to the front desk of the first hotel I would guard and see if they need anything before I begin my patrols for the night and I always checked in with the front desk as often as I could so they knew I was there to help if needed. I would then walk over to the second hotel and do the same thing. Most of the time they would ask me to go to a room and knock to let the guest know they were being a little too loud and that there was a noise complaint, and the guest would usually apologize and then quiet down for the night.  \n\nThis night in question, I had to deal with 3 entitled parents. One thing about the hotel is that the lobby closes to the public at 9 pm, so that means any large gatherings are prohibited from continuing at that time, and that is the time I would start work. I grabbed a radio so the hotels could contact me at any moment they needed security. I would walk from the first hotel after having let them know that I was on duty and I would make my way over to the second hotel and do the same thing. When I checked in with the front desk of the second hotel, the clerk behind the desk asked if I could talk to a group of adults who had been drinking and were getting very loud. I calmly and respectfully told them that they could continue their party in their rooms but they had to vacate the lobby as it was officially closed for the night. The clerk at the front desk had told me that she had tried to get them to quiet down and leave the lobby for the past 10 minutes yet they complained that as guests they were entitled to stay in the lobby.\n\nThey complained that the hotel had gotten security involved and complained on their way back to the rooms but left the lobby. I began my patrols when I got a call less than 30 minutes later at the same hotel because someone had complained that children were running in the halls. The hotel was currently hosting a sports event and many kids on the sports teams were there.  \n\nThe clerk behind the front desk had me meet her in the lobby and we went to the room we believed the children were, when I saw the kids, they said that they had all been outside until a moment ago when they came back to the room which I could verify as true. The kids then said that they had seen two kids that appeared to be twins running through the hallways. The clerk leaned her back and gave an exhausted sigh and told me that she had gotten all day about those two kids and she believed that the parents were in the group that had been kicked out of the lobby earlier.\n\nI walked around the hotel to see if I could find the room the kids were in and was stopped by hotel maintenance and told that they had seen those kids running away from the floor I was on and that the fire retardant cases were all open and one appeared to have been kicked in and was badly dented. I spotted the two kids in question and they immediately went back to their room at a running pace when they spotted me. I found out what room they were in and reported everything to the clerk before going to the first and second floor to find out if any more damage had happened and a guest had told me that they saw two twins running around the second floor and I found all of the cases open except one that had been broken, it was missing the handle and the glass was cracked.  \n\nI went to the lobby and showed the pictures of everything damage done and the clerk called her manager directly, at 10 pm on a Saturday night. (For those who don\u2019t know, most hotel management is never in on the weekends.)\n\nThe manager had said that these kids and their parents needed to leave immediately and charge the room for all damages done to the hotel. I waited until 10:30 pm to go to the room, hoping that the parents would be back in the room. I went up to the room and knocked on the door, and one of the kids responded. The encounter went as followed,\n\nOP: Hello, I am security for the hotel. Are your parents in the room?\n\nEntitled Kid: No\n\nOP: Can you tell me where your parents are?\n\nEntitled Kid: In another room.\n\nOP: Can you tell me what room they are in?\n\nThe entitled kid told me what room the parents are in, and I immediately told the children to contact their parents and have them meet me up at the room. As soon as the door closed, I stepped away from the door but kept it in the immediate view and contacted the front desk and asked the clerk to wait with me since we were dealing with minors and for safety reasons for all parties involved, and didn\u2019t want to deal with the \u201cHe was harassing us for no reason and stalking us all night\u201d crap.\n\nThe parents took 15 minutes to come to the room as they expected me to leave the floor the children were on and I was afraid they would run to another room and break more stuff on the way. The first thing that happened was the entitled father started yelling at me.\n\nEntitled Father: What are you doing creeping outside of our children\u2019s room?\n\nOP: Hello, I am a security officer with the hotel. I was asked to speak with you as your children have been accused of breaking hotel property.\n\nFriend of Entitled Parents: So you thought you would harass young boys? Do you get off on doing that or something?\n\nOP: Sir, your children have been accused of breaking hotel property and because of the risk of them supposedly doing this again. My job here is that I am assigned to protect this hotel from such things and as such, your children are considered a threat to the safety of the hotel.\n\nEntitled Father: You have no right to be outside of their room. You should have come to speak to us at our room, not be a creep and stand outside their room like a fucking pervert.\n\nOP: Sir, they are classified as a threat with the accusations of the destruction of private property. As it stands, the hotel managers have made it clear that you are no longer guests here and you must leave the property immediately.\n\nEntitled Mother: You have no proof that our children are behind this. They have perfectly behaved and they have been in their rooms all night.\n\nUnfortunately, as they kept trying to yell and talk over me, I was beginning to get irritated and was losing my polite attitude and started becoming that extreme asshole security guard with the cop attitude that no one wants to deal with.\n\nOP: That\u2019s bullshit. I have hotel staff that has seen them outside of their room. I have guests in the hotel that have seen them outside of their room. And I have personally seen that they have been outside of their room.\n\nEntitled Mother: Everyone else is lying and personally targeting our children, including you. There are many children here that could be the culprits behind these accusations but you are just choosing to blame everything on our children.\n\nOP: I don\u2019t care if you believe me or not, you need to leave the property immediately.\n\nIt is this moment that the entitled father got directly in my face and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything you say and we are not leaving, I work for the FBI.\u201d\n\nI looked at him and demanded he shows me his federal credentials proving that he is a part of the FBI. The state that I live and work in states that if you identify as a member of local or federal law enforcement or as a federal employee, you have to show your credentials, even if you live in another state.\n\nThe entitled father said he didn\u2019t have to until I told him this exact same law. He then told me that he left them in the room and needed to get them. When I was able to confirm that they didn\u2019t want to leave, I calmly walked back to the hotel lobby, but not before the entitled friend said, \u201cGo ahead and leave you pervert. You know you are wrong and that you have nothing to prove.\u201d\n\nAs soon as I was in the elevator, I got on the radio with another clerk at the front desk and told them to call the local Sheriff's department and told her the entire encounter and explained that they were now trespassing on hotel property. While the clerk was on the phone, the night auditor came in and I briefed him on what was going on. The entitled father came down and began demanding the hotel give the family a full refund or they were not leaving and that they couldn\u2019t do anything as he was FBI. He unfortunately severely scared the two clerks that were still on shift and made the night auditor nervous with this and I told them to let law enforcement know that the man was claiming this and that I now feared he had a weapon on the property. Thankfully they went back to their rooms after realizing that the hotel would not budge and they stayed in their rooms for the rest of the night. I checked all the hallways just in case but thankfully they remained clear for the rest of my shift.\n\nLaw enforcement showed up around 3 in the morning and when I explained everything to them, they became guarded, especially now that I said I feared the man was FBI and may have had a weapon on the property that was not registered in the hotel database. Law enforcement said that they could take the family away as they were trespassing but there was little that could be done. The parents told the officers that I had not talked to the parents nor had the hotel spoken to them about anything.\n\nThe entitled father and his friend started demanding information from the hotel about the clerks involved and all of my work information.  \n\nI told them I was not allowed to legally give out any of my work information outside of the name of my work. It wasn\u2019t true but the guy believed it and said he would contact my work and make sure my superiors here about me and how I was a creep. The rest of the night was uneventful and the entitled family stayed in their rooms but that was because they didn\u2019t want to leave and the night auditor was a nice guy and didn\u2019t want to kick the children out at 4 in the morning with nowhere else to go.\n\nSince the kids of these entitled parents were connected to a sports group and there were about 10 to 15 rooms all connected under the group, the hotel decided to charge each room with the destruction of property and attached a report from both hotel staff had written and myself to make sure it was known why each room was charged over $500 in damages.\n\nOne of the fun things about that night is that one of the Sheriffs that showed up was a friend from high school that I haven\u2019t seen in over 10 years. It was nice to catch up with him and see that he was doing good.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1672433621.0},{"title":"Mr Dude!","author":"RoseRed1987","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zzhsk9\/mr_dude\/","text":"My last 3-11 shift of the week.

We have contracts with a variety of construction companies for discounted room rates, and because I always work 3rd shift, I'm usually the one checking these guys in. So I've gotten to know a lot of them really well, and we've got a good bond. I took a week off and three of them went to my manager concerned that I'd quit. \n\nOne of these guys, Brad, is some kind of engineer in his 60s. If you're from the upper Midwest, you're familiar with the type: rangy, windburnt, a couple sad whisps of grey hair. Grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere, stolid, friendly, not super expressive. He always checked in on Mondays, and at first he irritated me because he always paid with cash for his $600 stay. But I warmed up to the old guy. He would always take a smoke outside with my coworker when she was there, and sometimes offered me a cig even though he knew I didn't smoke. Once, he brought up a bottle of some Canadian whiskey to the desk and asked if I'd like it. I love whiskey, so I took it, and we got started talking--first about how you absolutely need the egg white in whiskey sours, then about other liquor preferences. \n\nI said, \"Well, look. If I wanna get drunk *now*, vodka. But if I wanna enjoy my drink? Old fashioned, whiskey sour, or something fruity. I love fruity drinks.\"\n\nHe laughed, cleared his throat, and said, \"Hey, speaking of fruity. Uh. Can I ask you something?\"\n\nAt the time, I had neon purple hair, with my fingernails painted to match, and large rainbow earrings. So I braced myself for an extremely awkward question about my sexuality. \n\n\"What's up, man?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he coughed, \"you see. My nephew, he's 20, about your age, he, uh. Well. He just came out to the family.\"\n\nI nodded, prompting him to keep talking. \n\n\"And, uh, well. I--look, I love the kid. Is there anything that you guys--that I should, yunno. Do for him?\"\n\nI cocked my head. \"Whaddaya mean?\"\n\n\"Well, I mean--you, y'know, you guys, uh. Should I, say anything to him?\"\n\n\"I mean, I doubt you'll get him to change his mind--\"\n\n\"*No*, no,\" he said, face flushing, \"not like that. Like. Is there a card? I was thinking I'd maybe. Bake the kid a cake?\"\n\n\"Bake...him...a cake?\"\n\n\"Yeah, a cake. With, ah. With rainbow icing. And on the top I'd write 'Uncle Brad Loves You' or something. So he knows I love him no matter what. Something like that.\"\n\nI struggled to choke down laughter. \"I--Brad, I'm not sure the cake is necessary. Just keep...keep treating him like you always have, okay?\"\n\n\"No card?\"\n\n\"No, dude.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nBrad paused and stared at our shelf of Doritos. \"I've always made fun of him for not having a girlfriend. Can I start making fun of him for not having a boyfriend?\"\n\n\"You *absolutely* can.\"\n\n\"Cool. Cool. You know, he's about your age. Nice kid. Maybe I could--\"\n\n\"Brad, are you trying to set me up with your nephew?\"\n\n\"I--well. Aren't you single?\"\n\n\"Yes, very recently.\"\n\n\"How long were you two together?\"\n\n\"Long enough to get engaged.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, desperately trying not to laugh. \"Did you need to talk about anything else?\"\n\n\"Nah, no. Thanks buddy, enjoy the whiskey.\"\n\nHe left, and I went into the office and howled with laughter until I cried. To this day that's one of my favorite guest interactions.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1672373089.0},{"title":"Taking A Liar's Side","author":"Opposite_Medicine_60","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zzdk9e\/taking_a_liars_side\/","text":"Hey guys, it's me again. I know I haven't posted in quite a while, I'm sorry. Things have just been crazy with work and school and being really sick, so I haven't had the time. I promise that I will be typing up and posting the story of the NA (and the NA wannabe) probably this weekend. But today I wanted to post a bit of a rant, since I honestly think this might be the beginning of the end of my time of employment in this hellhole.\n\nSo, the NA wannabe is no longer employed with us (and I will include her story with the story of the NA), and they hired a new lady to replace her. I saw that she had hotel experience and was like cool, finally someone who knows what they're doing. And yeah, while she does everything well on the computer and hardly ever makes mistakes on paperwork, she is not without her problems. The biggest one we've noticed so far - her attitude. She is of the mind that she can't ever leave the front desk, no one is \"the boss of her\", she doesn't have to mop or keep the coffee or water fresh, and she doesn't have to do bucket checks. Like, her attitude really sucks. Another thing, it might just be me though, but she talks. Like, A LOT. I'm all for talking and everything, but when you literally don't take a breath in between sentences and stories and shit, it's a bit much. I get overwhelmed with too much auditory stimulation, so it's a bit too much for me to handle. \n\nBut anyways, let's start the story off with yesterday morning. I was feeling really drained at the end of my shift, because I was running on 4 hours of sleep, plus I've been dealing with an intestinal infection for 6+ months now, so I really wasn't in the mood to listen to her prattling on about stuff. When I'm tired, I tend to be pretty short with people (I know it's a problem, I'm working on it), and my ability to deal with noises decreases drastically. Anyways, she came in around 10 minutes early as usual, and started talking my ear off as usual, even though she could see that I was trying to read my book. I pretty much gave her monosyllabic answers, which she apparently didn't like, because she started getting an attitude with me. She tried to copy my numbers for the cash drawer instead of counting it herself, and when she got to the hundreds, she saw I had $100 in hundreds, but there was none in the drawer. She questioned it, and I told her she couldn't just copy my numbers because I took cash during my shift. Then she asked if my numbers were correct for the safe, and if she could \"trust my counting wasn't bad\". After I had clocked out, I sat in the lobby to wait for my wife to pick me up since she dropped me off the night before. She came up and asked if I mop the floor during my shift, and I told her yes, I mop at least once or twice a night, depending on how bad the floors are. She then proceeded to start complaining about my coworker and how she was \"lecturing her\" about her job duties. But whatever, my wife showed up, and I went home.\n\nLast night, I came into work to replace the coworker the new lady had been complaining about. Since I'm pretty good friends with that coworker, I told her straight out what the lady had said. She wasn't happy at all, which honestly I wouldn't be either. But in the morning, I decided I was gonna drop my paper with my numbers for the cash drawer, giving the lady no option but to actually physically count the drawer. She stormed in 2 minutes before clock in time, didn't acknowledge me or anything. So I was like alright, fine. Went out and started my car because it was chilly out, and when it was time I clocked out and left.\n\nWell, my coworker texted me later and said that apparently 1st shift lady was \"crying her eyes out\"; when she got to work this afternoon, she texted me about the whole thing. I'll type it out verbatim:\n\nCoworker: Apparently she was crying cause you were too mean to her\n\nMe: You're fucking shitting me right? I didn't even fucking do anything! She's the one who came in this morning and ignored me.\n\nI was short with her the other day bc I was tired af and not feeling well and just wanted to go home and go to bed so excuse me that I wasn't in the mood to listen to her prattling on about stupid shit.\n\nCoworker: Yeah I fucking know. She didn't talk to me much but fuck it was nice\n\nMe: She seriously needs to get over herself. She's how fucking old and crying just because I didn't want to talk to her?\n\nCoworker: Manager said she's gonna make up lists for every shift to get done and three strikes and you're fired. And she told me people need to get along up there and talk and not just ignore each other\n\nMe: You're fucking kidding me right?\n\nSo basically, my manager is just automatically taking her side without even asking what my side of the story was. I'm a little pissed off right now to be completely honest. Since when have coworkers needed to get along? I dunno, maybe I'm overreacting, but on top of all the other bullcrap going on at that place right now, this is just the cherry on top and I'm so done with the crap.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1672439428.0},{"title":"Weekly Free For All Thread","author":"marmothelm","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zzlwnu\/weekly_free_for_all_thread\/","text":"Want to talk about something that isn't a front desk tale?

For his sake, not mine.\n\nI love my NA job. Most nights I spend browsing Reddit, especially this thread. I have only recently graduated from lurker to poster, because I believe I have enough stories to satiate everyone. Being NA, I don't deal with a lot of people, which I like. And the people I do deal with are either trying to get to their rooms as quickly as possible, or are crackheads wanting something. Anywho, almost all of the reservations I check in are nice and thankful, but this family that wanted in was anything but. Since I only deal with people for at the most ten minutes, I can grit my teeth and bear it. I understand being jetlagged and exhausted from travel, so a smile is the least I can do.\n\nThis family consisted of a middle-aged married couple and an old man. The husband was the one checking in, so I dealt with him the most at first. As I was checking him in, he complained about their flight being delayed and how tired they were. I sympathized, and while I finished up, he walked to our market and picked out some snacks. When I told him the price, he retorted how expensive it was and demanded them for free for being a \"Shiny\", which I dismissed. I told him he could either have points, or free snacks, not both. And since he wanted points more, he paid for the goodies. The wife came in and asked for a wheelchair. I let her know that I didn't think we had a wheelchair, but went into my back room to check. Sure enough, no wheelchair. I went back to the front desk to let her know, but no one was there. I leaned across the counter to see if they were in the hall, but alas, no one was there. I couldn't even hear the elevator running. I was shocked, but since there wasn't a wheelchair to even use, there was no use trying to find them.\n\nHours pass, and I am just doing my sudoku and listening to podcasts. I get a call on the work phone, and when I answer, a man screams at me through the line, \"where the hell am I?!\" I try to speak, but he keeps rambling to me and cursing. I had just received some pretty nasty calls the previous days from scammers and spammers (which will be stories posted soon), so I figured this was just another man trying to scare me. I hung up on him and went back to my sudoku. I don't get paid enough to entertain creepy old men anymore.\n\nThe phone rings again. I stare at it for a few rings. Normally, bad guys don't call back. I ponder for a moment before picking it up. Sure enough, it's the same man, screaming again that he doesn't know where he is and how dare I hang up on him. I manage to get a word in. \"Sir, if you keep screaming at me, I will not hesitate to hang up again.\" I finally got his attention, so I continued. \"What seems to be the problem?\"\n\n\"I don't know where I am! I woke up, and I don't recognize this place. All I know is that this phone is here, so I am calling to ask where the hell I am!\"\n\nMy heart drops. \"Wait, are you telling me you're in this hotel right now?\"\n\n\"Yes! Why else would I be calling you?!\"\n\nThere was no use trying to explain what horrific calls I get as NA. Not that it mattered. \"Sir, what is your name?\" I ask, ready to find his room number in my system.\n\n\"I don't know!\" he whined, \"And I don't know where I am! Where am I, and how did I get here?\"\n\nI told him what hotel he was at and the city\/state. He didn't recognize any of it, telling me the last thing he remembered was being in Kansas. He didn't even remember his name. Since I didn't have a name, I couldn't check what room he was in. I told him to leave his room and check the number, then return to the line with me. He leaves the call, and I don't hear from him for a while. As I wait, I pace the front office, wondering what I should do. I don't know every guest in the building with me, so it would be nearly impossible to figure out who he was. That room number would be my saving grace, but even if I figured out who he was, the man didn't know who he was! Was this a medical emergency? Should I call an ambulance? I wasn't trained in this! What do I do?!\n\nThe sound of the elevator brought me back to reality. *This must be my guy,* I thought, forcing a smile on my face. The grin fell to the floor. Yes, it sure was my guy, but he was only wearing underwear. It was an old naked man, red with anger. I'm pretty sure no one else would come down to my desk in such a state. I welcome him and ask if he found his room number.\n\n\"I tried,\" yelled the old man, \"but the moment I walked out, the door slammed and locked behind me. I tried to get back in, but my keys are inside. That's why I am down here naked!\"\n\n\"You didn't see your room number?\"\n\n\"No! I was busy being naked!\"\n\n*Fair enough.* Except now I had no fucking way to identify him. Since he was naked, he didn't even have ID on him. I offered him a sheet, since he was cold, but he refused, demanding I let him back in his room. I tried to reason and tell him I had no idea his name or room, and asked if he came here with anybody or was traveling alone. He didn't know. With nowhere else to turn, I call 911. Even if it wasn't a medical emergency, I couldn't get any further in this without help.\n\nThe cops arrive, three of them. One of them I recognized from a hit and run I was just involved in. They pull a chair from the breakfast foyer and sit him down. Two of them start trying to rack his brain, and the other one asks me to try and figure out his name, as if I hadn't spent all this time trying. I print out all of our daily arrivals. I figured he must have come today, if he didn't recognize where he was. He thought he came with his nephew, but he didn't remember his name. Slowly, I go down the list, looking for rooms that had more than one person in them. Problem was, people don't have to disclose how many people they are bringing into their rooms. At a certain point, I had to start calling rooms. But where to start? My eyes fell down the list to a name popping up twice. This name had two rooms, right next to each other. I figured if this man really did come with someone, they might have gotten two rooms. There was no way that this man shared a room and didn't wake his roommate up with his yelling. It was as good as I could start.\n\nI call. It rung a couple of times, and a woman picked up. I apologized profusely and asked if she had an older man with her. She asked why. \"Well, there's an older man in my lobby who doesn't know where he is. I'm trying to figure out who he is and what room he came from.\"\n\n\"I'll be right down.\" *Click.* I inform the cops, and we wait anxiously for the woman to arrive. She steps off of the elevator, and a dog runs between her legs and out of the door. First off, dogs aren't allowed! How did that happen? Secondly, the woman was from the rude couple that were my last check-ins. She trudges up in her slippers. \"Dad, what are you doing down here?\"\n\nSo the old man was her dad. Thankfully my first call was correct, and I only had to wake one room up. I check her room details and see they're from South Carolina, not Kansas. Poor guy didn't remember anything from the last few decades of his life, apparently. Two of the police help take him up to his room, his daughter pulling and berating him the whole time. I felt bad for the guy and angry that this couple snuck their dog in. That's probably why they raced to their room and left me in the dust with the imaginary wheelchair. I write it down for them to be charged $250 in the morning. When the police came back down, I thanked them for their help and sent them on their way. All was quiet again, and the man found his family.\n\nEh, not yet.\n\nI get a call fifteen minutes later from the woman. She is angry, but not at her father. She's angry at *me.* \"Next time, maybe call me and not the police. How does that sound?\"\n\nI am completely floored. \"What do you mean? I had no clue who he was! He didn't even know who he was. I was prepared to wake up the whole hotel to find someone who knew him.\"\n\n\"Bullshit. You knew who he was. We checked in with you a few hours ago.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but you sent me to get a wheelchair before I got to see who was all with you. Besides, your father was nearly naked when he came down. I wouldn't recognize anyone in that state.\" I hung up and shook my head. How was this my fault all of the sudden? All of the stress of the hour was unappreciated by that family. Poor old man didn't deserve a daughter like that. I understand being your parent's caretaker must be hard, but damn.\n\nThe woman was charged for bringing that shih tzu dog in, but it was apparently reversed. She was able to provide papers, but the whole hotel knew they were fake. Service dogs do not run away like that. Plus, why would you sneak one in? That's one of my pet peeves, but there is nothing I can do about it. Anyway, I hope that old man is okay. I couldn't imagine the stress he went through. Moral of the story is no good deed goes unpunished.\n\n\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672392996.0},{"title":"Scammed","author":"crabdancer64","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zyx4hc\/scammed\/","text":"This story is the reason why I joined this Reddit thread. After I fell for this scam, I realized I had a lot to learn from people in my position, and now here I am, adding to the collection.\n\nI'm a NA. I don't deal with a lot of people, let alone phone calls. With my hours being the classic 11 PM - 7 AM, the only calls I get are from rooms and people wanting to rent a room. I have been NA for half a year now, but at the time of this story, I had only been working here for three months. I pride myself on being intelligent, but I still have a lot to learn. I have never fallen for a scam before until this story. You see, my hotel was sold from a management company to a private family the first week of October 2022, and a lot changed. Unfortunately, this left me open to trickery.\n\nLike I said, I don't deal with too many callers. So at 5:30 AM, when I got a call, I thought it strange, but I was there to help. The woman, whose name was \"Kari\" (doubt it is her real name, so I'm confident in providing it), called, telling me she was collecting card information on behalf of my boss. She was able to provide his name. I was wary of it, telling her I can't just give out people's cards, but she was just so convincing. The company was sold the week before, so I really didn't know if this was a new rule or what. She also had an accent, and so did my new bosses, so I was in a pickle. Kari was able to tell me exactly where the card book was, since I didn't know. I had never done this before. Kari told me to give her all the card information that wasn't 3rd party. I told her I really didn't think I should be doing this, but she told me it was okay. I told her I was new at this, and she said she was new at this, too.\n\nI ended up giving her two 3rd party card numbers that were exactly the same. I even think I mixed up the numbers. The next numbers were from a German trucking company, but she refused those. I thought that was weird, and I immediately knew I messed up. I bid here farewell, and immediately texted my new boss and explained what happened. When he finally responded, I was already at home. He told me the other location he owned just got off the phone with Kari, too, but they didn't give any info. He asked what card number I gave out, and I raced back to work to fetch the compromised cards. He said he would call the 3rd party and explain what happened. He also said he wasn't mad at me; scammers know how to trick even the most aware people. I still felt like shit, though. A good boss won't blame you, and I was thankful for his mercy.\n\nI now don't accept any calls that aren't rooms or people asking if we have vacancy. I will not accept a room purchase over the phone, or anything that involves telling me card information. If they are not in front of me, I will not rent them a room. I am not risking it. As NA, I don't deal with that much. If you want a room, you have to come in anyways, so just come and see me.\n\nI do think it's strange how Kari knew my boss's name, and how she knew where the credit card book was. I don't know if it's just in a spot most hotels have it, or if she knew for a more sinister reason. I didn't recognize the voice, so I couldn't tell you. When I asked my boss how she could have known his name, he said she may have called in advance to ask what the manager's name was. So if a random person asks for your boss's name, don't give it to them. Say you can take their number and have a boss\/manager call them back. When I tried to tell Kari she should ask my superiors for the card numbers, she convinced me there was no time and bossman knew what she was doing. She really was convincing. I also don't think she got away with any money, since it was 3rd party information I gave. Since she demanded non-3rd party, there must be a reason she can't have\/use it.\n\nDon't fall for what I did. It's really embarrassing to think and talk about, but I thought I would repay the stories I read about all the Mr. Patel shitstorms and whatnot. Don't be nice like I was. I should have listened to my gut, but since all the rules were in the middle of changing, I let my guard down. Your insides know what's right from wrong. It's kept your ancestors alive, so let it do its job and keep you from getting scammed.\n\n\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672395437.0},{"title":"\u201cI\u2019m suing you for homophobia!\u201d","author":"jamiejams2648","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zyju5o\/im_suing_you_for_homophobia\/","text":"Obligatory \u201cI\u2019m on mobile\u201d blah blah blah\n\nI just found this subreddit, and boy do I have some stories but this is one of my favorites.

She tells me that her mom is at home, about 6 hours away so that\u2019s not possible. Her mom booked the room for Karen and the son. \n\nSo I said \u201cOkay, in that case I would need [mother] to fill out a credit card authorization form for me to be able to check you in with her card.

It wasn't those guests that are confused by hotel time (day rollover etc.) either she full on expected me to break the rules for her. She had a reservation for the current day that she made through central.\n\nA little after 12AM she calls\n\nCrazyLady: I need to check-in early at 2AM.\n\nMe: I'm sorry?\n\nCL: I need to check in early at 2AM and checkout the next day.\n\nMy spidey senses are on hight alert from her tone alone I have dealt with people like this before.\n\nMe: I understand, our check-in time is at 3pm the day of the reservation if you require an early check-in I can certainly do that after I close out the day around 3AM\n\nCL: No, I need to check-in at 2AM for the next day not tonight.\n\nMe: OK, our check-in time is 3pm after 3AM I can check you in for the next business day with an early check-in fee in addition to the regular room rate for the night.\n\nCL: *awkward pause* I travel a lot and that has never been an issue\n\nMe: *\\*thinking to myself\\* yeah right liar* As posted on our website our check-in time is 3pm if you require an earlier check-in I can provide that with an early check-in fee in addition to the regular rate for the day.\n\nPeople like this can sniff blood a mile away and WANT you to get flustered so they can use that against you. There's no way I'm checking her in at 2AM for the next day because that's impossible and even if it weren't I wouldn't do that without an early check-in fee.

They put me on pause several times as they relayed what I said earlier to her again. She was lying to them claiming that \"someone\" she spoke to earlier at our FD told her she could check-in early and avoid an early check-in fee.\n\nShe then demanded my name apparently and I refused to give it because of her misrepresentation of our interaction. I told them she can contact my management personally but her demands are something I simply cannot provide.

This takes place on a Saturday in the period where the \u2018stay at home\u2019 order had been revoked and people were once again free to move around and conduct their travels. But where my hotel is makes it convenient for people both going to and coming in from the neighboring city for the beach and boardwalks (and all the hotels that are closer at that time are booked solid).\n\nThat said, we were a bit caught off guard at the sheer amount of people who wanted to go and it led to the following situation.\n\nSaturday is usually a day where things get pretty hectic, there are a lot of reservations, and on top of those, there are same day bookings and overall the front desk can get crowded. So my shift ends at 11, but seeing the veritable horde of guests at the front desk and us only having only one night auditor on duty, me and one of the new Front Desk Agents decided to stay back to help her out. Now a lot of the guest have made third-party reservations, online companies and the like but we have a system in place that lets us tell our third parties we can no longer take any reservations and they stop sending them into our system. Thing is, if a guest made a online third party reservation and it doesn\u2019t appear, we take no money for this and you can essentially can get a refund if you call the third party and get a refund as we technically didn\u2019t have the reservation and therefore all the credit is still on the virtual card provided.\n\nWe were struggling to check everyone we could in but frankly it was taking time and the newest agent was having trouble and was constantly pulling me away mid-reservation to get my help despite me instructing him to not do that if I am checking a guest in (I was actually talking to a guest and told him to wait when within the next minute he literally dragged me to his console to help him [I didn\u2019t appreciate that and neither did management when they heard]).\n\nFinally a guest comes and states his name, and the newest agent can\u2019t seem to find him, and there was a lull in my station so I was able to assist him. I check our check-in logs and even see if the third-party simply misplaced the first and last name when making the reservation, but no matter what I do, I simply cannot find his reservation.\n\nHe starts getting loud about his reservation should be there and we are lying.\n\nWe check every possible way we can, but frankly it\u2019s not there and he demands we refund him.\n\nI take over and explain that we didn\u2019t take any money in the first place so we are not going to refund him money we didn\u2019t take when he scowls and then says, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you can\u2019t do it with a card! Just pay out of pocket!\u201d\n\nAnd he then he holds out his hand as though expecting us to hand him a wad of money.\n\nI take a deep breath to reply calmly but the newest agent is now angry, \u201cWhat the hell do you mean pay out of pocket? The hell we are paying you for a nonexistent reservation!\u201d\n\nThe guest blinks and then says, \u201cYou can\u2019t talk to me like that! I am a guest!\u201d\n\nI pinched the bridge of my nose and take a moment to try to push back the headache I know is fighting to form.\n\nSeveral guests even shoot me a sympathetic look as they can tell I am doing my best and I have not raised my voice or betrayed my exhaustion from working an hour and half over my eight hour shift.\n\nEither way I finally let some of my frustration out and tell the front desk agent that I am handling this and please focus on the last few guests in the lobby and don\u2019t interrupt me.

He throws more cusses at me, but by the time the door locks, I'm safe. Except he goes outside the hotel windows and screams some more at me for a few minutes.

I wish I could make this shit up.\n\nIt was probably 2 AM, since I hadn't yet run audit. There are two doors to the hotel: the outside sliding doors, which are always open, and the lobby sliding glass doors, which I lock the moment I start my shift. I can hear the front doors open whenever a guest arrives, which gives me time to stand up and reach the button if I want to let someone in.\n\nWell, I hear the front doors open, and I see the reflection of a man stand between the doors. I wait on bated breath to allow him entry, but he stands there for a few minutes. All I can see is that he is dressed completely in red. I'm talking hoodie, pants, and shoes. An odd fashion choice, for sure, but to each their own. He eventually wants in, and that's when I see it - blood. The whole right side of his face is bloody, from his scalp, to his chin. I let him in immediately so I can help him.\n\nMe: \"Oh my gosh, are you okay?!\"\n\nMan: \"Yeah, can I have a room?\"\n\nI am completely taken aback.

I am angry that someone could beat their partner up.\n\nMe: \"If you don't need medical attention, I can rent you a room. But you CANNOT let her in here. I don't care how much you love her or how much she apologizes. She cannot enter this building. I am not letting that in here.\"\n\nHe agrees, and I give him the nightly rate. He digs in his wallet to pull out the money, and when I look at his ID, I'm a little taken aback. It's a Michigan ID, but it didn't have half the information I would expect. Half of the card was white. It pretty much only had his photo and his description. No address, nothing. I'm still getting used to different state's ID's, and I was a little busy, as you can imagine. Before I could ask about the ID, one of my reservations came in. The bloody man is still digging in his wallet, because since he wanted to pay cash for his room, I needed a $250 room deposit for incidentals. I had a feeling he didn't have the money. I mean, he came in with only the red clothes on his back. He steps aside and asks for the bathroom while I help my reservation.\n\nI check him in, and wait for the battered man to come back. When he does, he fumbles with his wallet some more, and I nearly pass out. He smells so badly of weed now, which is one of my least favorite smells. As he digs some more, I start to wonder... where did he smoke that weed? The side doors are near the bathroom, but I am getting a little suspicious of him.\n\nMe: \"If you smoke in the room, I will take your entire deposit.\"\n\nMan: \"I understand. I won't, I promise. I also don't have enough money to cover the deposit.\"\n\nMe: \"Then I cannot rent to you. I can look up some nearby hotels and motels for you.\"\n\nHe thanks me, and I give him some estimates to some of the other properties in the area. Right before he leaves, I stop him.\n\nMe: \"Hey, you don't deserve to be hit. At all. Don't ever let her hit you. I'm not saying beat her up, but don't accept that from anybody.\"\n\nHe agrees, and leaves. By that time, it's nearly three, which is when I run audit.

Can I stay another night?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, you can stay a second night, but it would be another charge to your card.\"\n\nCaller: \"So you want me to pay for a room for only a few hours and check out?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, because if you stay again, you're sleeping two nights for the price of one.

It smells horribly of weed, there are a dozen paper towels strewn across the floor, and worst of all, there's some kind of neon yellow\/green piss all over the toilet and floor. I have no clue what that man did in there, nor do I want to know. I left it for an hour or so, not knowing what to do, before going in and scrubbing everything. The bloody man never came back, nor did the caller arrive.\n\n \ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80\ud83e\udd80","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1672312904.0},{"title":"Give Me My Car Back or I Will Have You Arrested!","author":"YARNfics","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zxmben\/give_me_my_car_back_or_i_will_have_you_arrested\/","text":"Back into the stories from my job!\n\nMe: Generally average chronically depressed loser.\n\nKaren: Lady who was staying at the hotel.\n\nGM: General manager.\n\nPO1: Police Officer 1\n\nPO2: Police Officer 2\n\nSo I was working the front desk with my GM in the back and generally things weren\u2019t irregular, people came in, got checked in, etc. If you want more details about my work and what I do, just check my previous posts for more info.\n\nLife was fine until a lady walks in and storms to the front desk, scowling at me.\n\nOh boy. Here we go.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my car?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour car?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! What happened to it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know ma\u2019am\u2026 Is it damaged or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not there anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not! Where did you take it?\u201d\n \n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything! I certainly didn\u2019t take your car!\u201d\n\nSo after this loud exchange the GM comes to the front wondering what all the noise is. He asks what the problem is and she yells at him as I let him handle the angry guest. He could already tell she was the unreasonable type of person who didn\u2019t care how things worked so long as it was in her favor. Seeing this I am glad to be out of the situation (I wasn\u2019t).\n\nAs it turns out her car was towed because she hadn\u2019t placed the parking ticket we provide our guests \u2014 for free \u2014 on her dashboard so they can park at our hotel. This little rule was added because people don\u2019t care that our parking lot is not a free parking car lot where they can leave their car for an indefinite amount of time. You have to be a guest or do a \u2018Park and Fly\u2019 with us for us to issue a parking permit for use. We hand them out to every guest and inform them \u2014 every time \u2014 that they need to place them on their car dashboards immediately or our security will call the towing company we contract to tow their vehicle away (no, leaving it in your pant pocket doesn\u2019t count sir). They tow all week but their customer center is only open weekdays and I think it was a Saturday or Sunday so she was already in a bad way on that front.\n\nHer first version of events is we never told her that.\n\nThe GM said that it\u2019s part of our standard check-in speech and if she didn\u2019t listen it\u2019s not on us.\n\nThen her next version is that she left her window open and someone must have stolen her ticket (and only the ticket).\n\nWe call the towing company and one of the few attendants mentions that when that vehicle was brought in with all windows closed and they didn\u2019t see a ticket anywhere. We asked if it was possible for them to bring the vehicle back so that we could just circumvent this whole issue and get her to stop throwing a fit at the front desk. They were closed and didn\u2019t have any drivers available to do that as it was the weekend.\n\nThen \u2014 my favorite \u2014 she turns to me \u2014 and ignores the GM entirely \u2014 and demands that I bring her car back or she will have me arrested for car theft.\n\nI give her the most \u2018wtf, are you serious?\u2019 look I can and my GM scoffs before saying we can\u2019t help her as the blame is solely on her.\n\nShe storms off and I shrug and my GM goes into the back thinking that she gave up.\n\nWell if you read the cast of characters then you can infer that I was wrong about that assumption.\n\nShe comes a while later in flanked by two police officers and a smug smirk firmly on her face as she pointed at me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s him! Make him give me my car back!\u201d\n\nThey walk up to me and say, \u201cExcuse me, we are here about a report on a car being stolen?\u201d\n\nI sigh and take a moment to pinch the bridge of my nose and give the lady a very deadpan glance before turning to the officers, \u201cI assume Karen called you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes she did.\u201d\n\nI roll my eyes and launch into an explanation of events and why her car has been towed, not stolen.\n\nFortunately the offers are very calm on the matter and when they asked for more details on the towing company we have a contract with, they nodded in understanding. They did inquire if I called the company to return the car and after saying we did but they were closed, they walked back to her.\n\nI could even catch one of them mutter, \u201cWhy are we even here?\u201d\n\nAfter they talked to her and her growing more and more outraged, she finally threw up her hands in frustration, stomped off to her room, and left the next day.\n\nShe trashed the room, but we had her card on file so we got the last laugh.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672264672.0},{"title":"When your Name Becomes a Synonym for Karen","author":"yalyublyumenya","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zxos34\/when_your_name_becomes_a_synonym_for_karen\/","text":"I don't remember exactly what happened a few years back with this particular guest, all I can remember was that she was a next level Karen to the point that she was brought up at a staff meeting, and I made the joke that we should start referring to particularly troublesome guests as \"a Mrs. Smith\" (Not going to use her real last name for obvious reasons). For awhile, we actually did start referring to the more Karenesque guests as \"Mrs. Smiths\". As in, \"Rm 112 is a real 'Mrs. Smith', so watch out for him.\" \n\nI haven't seen her for a good few years. I thought God had blessed us, and that she was gone forever.\n\nNope.\n\nI came in at 15:00 for my normal shift, and everything seems to be okay for the first ten minutes, just as I'm settling in, the phone rings.\n\nMrs. S: \"Hey, Yalyublyumenya, we're on our way. I hope y'all have those oatmeal raisin cookies. This is Mrs. Smith, do you remember me?\"\n\nMe: *horrified* \"Oh, uh. . . Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nMrs. S: \"I'm just checking on my reservation for tonight.\"\n\nI searched through today's reservations, and she didn't have one. She gave me two different confirmation numbers, and tells me that she paid with points. So, I give her the corporate number, and asked her to call them. She was already a bit heated.\n\nThings are calm for a moment, before the phone begins to ring once more. Much to my chagrin, it's once again Mrs. S is on the line, and asking me to check, and recheck her confirmation. She starts to get angry, and hangs up. Not long after that I get my third call from Mrs. S, and she wants to go ahead and book a room through me for the night, and she ~~warns~~ tells me she will be arriving in 20 minutes, but at least she has apologized, because her room was actually booked in South Carolina, and this is somehow corporate's fault (More on that later).\n\nShe comes in, and asks to see the room, which is something that isn't normally done in our post-March 2020 world, as the rooms are sanitized, but this is Mrs. S, so I should just cut my losses. I show her the single queen that she'd reserved, and she goes on and on about how claustrophobic she is, and asks if we can get her a double (2 Queens). I told her that we were unfortunately sold out.\n\nAt that point, her husband is on the phone with corporate, because \"He's calmer than [her],\" yikes. When her husband wasn't able to steamroll corporate, she gets me on the phone with them right in front of her, so I can't tell them what I really want to say.\n\nSo, I excuse myself, and call my boss outside. There are some doubles that are out of order for no real reason. My boss tells me to absolutely not give her one of those rooms, mostly out of spite. So, I come back in, and my coworker has checked them into the room I'd assigned them, but she's still down here bitching, and tells me that she'll get things sorted with corporate for her next night.\n\nWhat happened next has **never happened** in all my 13 year hospitality career. I get a call at the desk **from corporate** telling me that I need to notate on her file that she is absolutely not to receive any compensation, or points for her stay. I told him that she was an absolute nightmare, and he agreed, saying that she had been harassing them for the last four hours. I begged him to flag her or something, and apparently there are a lot of notes on her account that I can't see. He promised me that her account would be suspended. I don't really believe him, but I'm glad that for once corporate had our back, and reached out to us to tell us to shut her the fuck down.\n\nETA: I forgot to follow up, and tell you that the first lady I talked to told me that she hadn't booked with points. She had used a voucher for the hotel that she'd actually booked. She probably got it because she complained so much. She thought she could cajole corporate into transferring the reservation. She demanded double the points be refunded to her. . . 0x2=0, bitch.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672270370.0},{"title":"Day of misadventures made better by great hotel staff","author":"jcbsews","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zxxl7j\/day_of_misadventures_made_better_by_great_hotel\/","text":"I'm the guest, but wanted to share a happy ending - We're on the road from Indiana to Atlanta, I get a call sometime midday from hotel's corporate to tell me that the hotel we booked has a burst water main, and could they move us to one of their other locations?  Sure, Other Location XYZ is good too, so we instead went there (side funny story - when I got the updated confirmation for the new location, everything was correct *except* the name on it was a totally different one than mine.  Called corporate office back, and the person who helped me and I had a good chuckle when we realize the name on the reservation in the computer was correct, but the name on my email was the person in that office who processed the change.  Fixed, received a new email rebooking confirmation with my own name so we're good to go - but wait not so fast...)  Arrive rather late and check in, go to the room.  The LCD display on the AC is completely blank, so we can't turn the air on.  No problem, I go immediately back to the front desk, explain, and ask if we could switch to a room with working AC, but they're *completely* sold out (refer back to previously mentioned burst water situation in the other location with everyone in that hotel rebooked across the others), so I offer to pay the difference if a higher categeory is available and only mine is full.  No, but awesome front desk guy (I think he was the manager, it was not the person who checked me in and he's carrying keys and stuff) works some magic, finds a room listed as not available because it still needed some towels etc., adds missing housekeeping items to the room himself, and moves us. (It's an ADA room which I normally wouldn't take in case someone needs it, but we arrived at 11PM and are leaving tomorrow morning early).  He made an already very long and complicated day work out in the end for us, in what I'm sure is a hugely stressful situation for them too - I want to offer a thank you to all of you staff people on this sub who make magic happen every day!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1672293818.0},{"title":"\"The shoes are not worth it.

After everything went online with COVID, I decided it was time to go back into the workforce as a way to accrue some cash while looking out for my mom and dad, and luckily the owners of the hotel were able to hire me back. So this time around I work weekends and cover for people who request time off every now and then. This event takes place on a Sunday evening of the recent time of about a month or two ago, and in my experience, it is a regular Sunday which is one of the most relaxing days to work. The massive amount of check-outs are already done, you\u2019ll get a few check-ins, maybe a couple of walk-ins, but it\u2019s not the line-to-door clutter of a usual Saturday where we usually have to lock down check-ins so we aren\u2019t overbooked. Anyway, given the still reeling of the hospitality industry post the stay-at-home order and now the Delta Variant, we don\u2019t always have two people available at the desk, and because of that the higher ups say that if there is only one person working the front, don\u2019t leave the front desk unless you need to get something from housekeeping (which takes a handful of seconds).\n\nAnyway onto the story\u2026\n\nWith the mask mandate in effect, it\u2019s up to me and my fellow FDAs (read as \u2018Front Desk Agent\u2019) to enforce it as best as we can. We give out masks to guests who don\u2019t have a mask when we have spare ones and ask that all guests wear them and that isn\u2019t usually an issue. Since it was Sunday, even with only me, I was able to keep up and even had time to sit and relax. Everybody who I checked in wore their masks and I decided to be productive and check my system to see how many check-ins I had left and cleared up out email a bit by sorting the emails we received into their respective folders. Overall? Not in a bad time and pretty relaxed.\n\n(\u201cThat one!\u201d The Higher Power cried, \u201cHe\u2019s in a good mood! Not enough suffering!\u201d)\n\nIt was then the elevator opened and Karen strode out and made a beeline towards me.\n\nNow several times people come to the front desk. Sometimes they want to know where the pool is, sometimes they need towels, toiletries, a list of nearby restaurants, or maybe to buy something from the pantry area, nothing out of the ordinary there.\n\nNot sensing the impending headache I was about to meet the cause of\u2026\n\n\u201cHello, ma\u2019am. Can I help you with something?\u201d I greeted warmly.\n\n\u201cYou could help me by doing your job!\u201d She seethed.\n\nA bit thrown by her hostility, I replied with a confused, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you enforcing masks here? Are you trying to cause more COVID cases?\u201d\n\nI blinked and even prodded my mask, making sure it was in place, \u201cMa\u2019am we are enforcing the masks at this location. Everyone I checked in had been wearing their masks when I checked them in.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo you aren\u2019t! I just had to walk past a bunch of people going to their rooms who weren\u2019t wearing masks on the second floor!\u201d\n\nOkay, first of all, I am not unaware or unsympathetic as to why she might be worried, people who are older are much more likely to die from COVID and she may not have been able to acquire the vaccine. That said, taking it out on me is not okay as I have no way of enforcing it after a guest leaves the front desk given the rules set. Also as a side note, there no place on the second floor to stop and shoot the breeze as it is literally two hallways \u2014 one going left and one going right \u2014 and a conference that is locked unless reserved by a group for use.\n\nBut okay, I guess she doesn\u2019t understand my limitations and don\u2019t see any harm in explaining why I really can\u2019t do much about the situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, but I can\u2019t go to the second floor or the third floor for that matter to enforce them to wear their masks while going to their room. I have to stay at the font desk as I am the only agent here. Also, it be incredibly unprofessional to hover over guests shoulders while they go to their room even if I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to wait for twenty minutes before I could leave my room so I didn\u2019t catch anything from anyone!\u201d\n\nI almost shrugged helplessly, but I managed to restrain it since it may have come across as uncaring, \u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, there really is nothing I can do in my position\u2026\u201d\n\nApparently that was just not okay to her.\n\n\u201cSo you are trying to spread COVID? You are going to get me infected!\u201d She growled.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I am not trying to cause you or anyone else to catch anything! I really just can\u2019t help because I have to stay at the front!\u201d I protested calmly.\n\n\u201cIs there a manager I can speak to?\u201d\n\nI figuratively placed my head in my hands and screamed, not this stereotype! (Then again, considering this reddit line, it was).\n\n\u201cAs the only one here, I am the acting manager\u2026\u201d I said meekly, hoping this could defused before my good mood evaporated.\n\nAnd after threats of getting my job, calling her friend who is an inspection officer and having the hotel closed, and threats of bad reviews for me personally, she huffed and went back to her room for the whole stay. My day wasn\u2019t ruined as she wasn\u2019t the worst person I had to deal with \u2014 she\u2019s got nothing on the guy who threw a metal cup at me for his bank taking too long on his deposit or accused me being a pedophile for not having towels immediately at the front desk \u2014 but a Karen nonetheless.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672264509.0},{"title":"Our ice machines are in the wrong place and our staff is probably racist","author":"BecentiComposer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zx4gcu\/our_ice_machines_are_in_the_wrong_place_and_our\/","text":"I used my vacation hours this Christmas season and was off for more than a week which I sorely needed and returned of course to drama. This story happened a few days ago with a new hire FD agent and we're all impressed with how she handled it.\n\nWhen it comes to customer service 1st impressions are a big deal, supposedly, and that came into play. This couple checked in and in their review had nothing but praise for our exceptionally nice \"fair looking\" FD agent. They checked in early at 11:30AM and though we were busy we weren't sold out so our FD agent ginned up the sale and even waived the early check-in fee and everyone was happy as can be.\n\nOne of our FOMs who's not so fair looking and apparently with a \"darker\" personality was also on property and dealt with the couples initial complaint. Our property is U shaped with one end extending longer than the other. In the middle of the bottom U is our elevator which has ice machines next to the elevator and ice machines on each ends of the property as well. They were booked on the longer end nearer to the elevators.\n\nThe wife came down and asked where our ice machines are located and the FOM told her \"I know that\" but they needed one closer apparently. They hadn't been in the room that long so the FOM offered to move them to a room closer to the elevator and ice machine as that seems more convenient and the guest plopped her hand down and said \"now that would be too noisy wouldn't it.\"\n\nOur FOM them offered to move them closer to the end of the property at no charge \"you mean we have to move\" so an awkward standstill. The guest left the FD saying our hotel is poorly designed. A few moments later they came down and our FD agent was at the FD and they expressed relief that a \"nice\" person was there to help them. They asked for more linens\/blankets etc. which was granted and advised there may be a small wait.\n\nThe rooms were stilled being stripped and everything washed and the guests called and asked what was taking so long, the FDA apologized and said it won't be too much longer before we have fresh linens. A few minutes later they come down and asked when the linens would be ready. The FDA explained it was an early check-in and the housekeepers were busy with rooms atm and would bring fresh linens asap.\n\nThat was an unacceptable answer for them \"she seemed so nice\" and were taken aback their requests weren't dealt with immediately. The FDA tried explaining the situation as clearly as she could but they weren't having it. They claimed they asked a housekeeper directly for fresh linens and were rebuffed because they didn't\/refused to speak English and laughed at them.\n\nAt that point the FDA \"turned dark\" and told them they were welcome to leave with\/without a refund because it was clear our property would not be able to provide them with acceptable accommodations.

Our shuttle runs 24\/7 but after the pandemic we only have one shuttle while before we had two shuttles to decrease wait time. Currently, it runs on a half-hour schedule so it leaves the hotel on the top and bottom of the hour and picks up at the airport on the 15 & 45. The only way to be fair to our guests and keep the schedule accurate is to leave the hotel right on the dot and we only wait a few minutes IF you called down ahead of time to let us know you were running late. Because the shuttle only fits so many people, we tell our guests at check-in to sign up for a time slot so we can ensure we don't end up with 20 people showing up for a shuttle that only fits 12. Though we are not required to do so, most of us at the desk explain to the guest that they need to be in the lobby 5 minutes before the time they signed up for as the shuttle leaves right on time and does not wait. apparently the FOM checked him in and didn't mention that part, which imo was a mistake but it's not something he requires us to do and I'm the one who put in the effort to train my coworkers to do just that and as I am not a supervisor no one is required to take my advice and tell it to the guests even though it prevents this sort of thing.\n\nToday, a guest who signed up for a 7AM shuttle came down at 7:03AM. I informed the guest that the shuttle had departed and he would need to wait for the next available shuttle. He said to reserve him another shuttle immediately, and I informed him that he would be signed up for the next shuttle at 7:30AM. He reiterated that he wanted to RESERVE a shuttle RIGHT NOW and that he had already reserved himself a shuttle for 7AM. I told him again that he would be signed up for the next available shuttle which just got me another insistence that he had RESERVED the shuttle. I realized that he was under the impression that he was oh so special and the shuttle was leaving at 7AM for him specifically rather than leaving at 7AM for our guests in general because that's when it always leaves. I tried to explain to him that no, he did not reserve a shuttle specifically for himself that was guaranteed to take him when he needed it, but rather he just put his name down to let us know how many people to expect for the already scheduled departure. Of course, he's super special and important so he kept reiterating that he had reserved a shuttle and therefore we needed to get another shuttle for him immediately. I told him we have one driver so there's no way to get another shuttle going right then and there for him. Which was met with... you guessed it... bUt I rEsErVeD iT\n\nno sir, you did not reserve the shuttle. you said you'd be here for the 7AM shuttle and then you were late and it left. oh, and his wife came down 5 minutes later so even if he had bothered to let us know he was going to be late we wouldn't have been able to wait that long for the entire party to be ready.\n\nI will say, the one good thing he had going for his behavior was that he never invoked his status (highest status at our hotel outside of lifetime or owner status) but he did ask for the manager's card and I'm sure we'll get a bad review out of it.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1672075797.0},{"title":"Entitled mom, entitled kid?","author":"nwi_nightauditor","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zvpuhm\/entitled_mom_entitled_kid\/","text":"It's been a while since I've had anything 'share worthy' happen, so I knew it was just a matter of time.....\n\nOur breakfast caf\u00e9 is right across the lobby from our front desk, and as such, I can usually hear pretty much everything going on over there. That was the case this morning.\n\nI could hear a female guest arguing with my breakfast attendant, although I couldn't quite make out what they were arguing about. A few minutes later, a guest came to the front desk with a kid to say that we were out of all juices in the caf\u00e9. I wanted to say that I knew that because there has been a sign on the machine for a few weeks stating that very thing. But instead, I apologized and said that our supplier was out the last time we placed an order, and all flavors of juices we on backorder. Needless to say, she was not a happy camper.\n\nShe looked over into our gift shop (which is right next to the FD) and asked if she could **HAVE** (emphasis hers) some of the juice from the cooler. I asked her 'what juice?' as we don't have any juice for sale in it. She said 'the Pureleaf' juice. I told her that that was tea, and that all items in the cooler were for sale only and boy, did she ever throw a hissy fit. She went on to say that there was nothing over in the caf\u00e9 for a child to drink, and she wasn't going to give her kid coffee, as it's \"dangerous.\" I'm thinking 'really? Well then , with as much coffee as I drink, I guess I'm in big trouble.' LOL. I then go on to tell her that milk and water are both available in the caf\u00e9, and she replies, 'my baby don't like milk.' Her \"baby\" looked to be around 12 to 13. Once again, I apologized, but told her that if she wanted something out of our gift shop, she would have to pay for it. She had a few more choice words for me, but she did eventually buy a sweet tea and a can of coke.\n\nAs they were walking away, the kid asked if she could have a candy cane from our Christmas tree, and I told her that yeah, she could take one, and then I turned back to what I was doing before she came to the FD. About 30 minutes later, I had to go out to the lobby to put a luggage cart back in place that a guest just left sitting in the middle of the lobby. As I walked past the Christmas tree, I noticed that there were NO candy canes left on the tree. Earlier in the night, I hung 30 canes on the tree. Since only a few people had been thru the lobby since I told the girl she could take one, the only thing I can figure is that the little shit took all the candy canes from the tree. With as much sugar that's in a candy cane (and these were pretty good sized canes), I'm sure they're more \"dangerous\" than coffee. Juvenile Diabetes is a real thing kiddo. I wouldn't wish diabetes on anyone (I have Type 2 and it sucks), but I wouldn't feel too terribly bad if she developed diabetes. Yeah, I know, I'm going to hell.

I'd like to not mention his name since he seems to have cleaned up his act a bit these days.\n\nWas working in a more obscure resort location and we got a booking in from Big Name OTA's VIP division (yes, it's a thing, they are like a travel agency for the rich and famous) with an obviously fake name for 3 nights. Highest room category, rack rate, all benefits. Management was happy.\n\nAnd shortly thereafter in walks our esteemed guest. Now I've seen him plenty of times on the screen to recognize him, but something was... off..... he was fat, had long greasy hair and slurred his speech. And thus began the rollercoaster ride of his vacation with us. Joining him was his wife and kid for their annual holiday.\n\nThe first afternoon was fine and they were mostly in their suite and ordered room service, but on the second day it started to get interesting. He shows up up in the lobby with a one liter bottle of Smirnoff and wearing only the hotel bathrobe. Plops himself down on one of the lobby sofas and starts playing with his phone while taking big gulps from the bottle. We all knew how this stay was gonna play out.\n\nFor the most part the drinking was just constantly on-going and he could be seen around the hotel with a fat bottle and his bathrobe. Wife and kid were mostly by the pool and we organized some excursions for them. On check out day the wife comes up to us and tells us they want to extend at least another 4 nights since they're having a good time and her husband was \"rejuvenating\".\n\nAnd things just went downhill from there, as he was becoming increasingly more drunk for longer periods of time, and finally he tripped on some steps and knocked out one of his front teeth. I had to arrange for him to get seen by a dentist immediately in order to fix that as he was due to start filming the following week.\n\nAt this stage we started to get more concerned with his behavior and possible liability issues and we approached his wife to discuss this point, who was not at all alarmed by any of it, however she understood our issues and said she will have his bodyguard hop on the next flight over as he is the one that usually deals with his excessive drinking problems. The next afternoon he arrives, we get him checked in to the room next door. We did a quick welfare check in our actor's room and surprise surprise he's passed out on the floor clutching his vodka. His bodyguard shows concern on his face and says he appears to have fallen off the horse. Yeah no shit.\n\nSo here's where I learned something new in my life: when you are rich and famous there is a solution to everything. In this case, there is a doctor whose sole career is flying all over the world and giving celebrities rapid medical detox. The bodyguard has the guy on the line, and apparently he was in Romania at the time and would be on a private jet over to us, ETA end of the day.\n\nDr. Detox arrives with a mountain of boxes and medical equipment, and we open yet another suite, this one to be turned into a 48-hour detox rehab clinic. At this point we didn't even give a shit about the legality of it anymore, we just wanted him sobered up and out the door.\n\nAll in all, quite an interesting experience, however 10\/10 would not recommend for others to experience if not necessary.\n\nAnd as I said in the opening, he seems to have gotten some help now, he's definitely lost weight and back in good physical shape and he is no longer embarrassing himself in front of the paparazzi with his drunken antics. As I know everyone will try to guess his identity, I will tell you that most, if not all of you reading this, would at least be familiar with his (very attractive) face, many would know his name too. If you're a girl in the 25-35 year old age bracket you probably had a massive crush on him in high school. If you're a guy, you've seen some of his action movies and thought him shooting up Paris was the coolest shit ever.

My hotel is no exception: we are located about a mile and a half away from a major Division I university, with the football stadium being a straight shot down one single road. There are five other hotels basically right next to us in our area and dozens upon dozens more on the other sides of the campus. On football weekends & graduation weekend, every single hotel within five miles from each edge of the campus sells out at least a month before the event (with graduation specifically selling out more than half a year prior).\n\nI give this context to state that demand for rooms is extremely high for these special events. For that very reason alone, our cancellation policy for said special events is as follows: **once the reservation is made, you may cancel anytime seven days or more from the first day of the event (typically Fridays for these) and we charge a small cancellation fee (it's between $15-$30. Won't say the exact amount). You cannot cancel within seven days of the event (or at the very least, you won't get your money back).**\n\nMakes sense right? For events where we sell out at least months in advance, we don't want people hoarding rooms and then cancelling last minute when we could've sold it to at least a dozen other people (or possibly not selling it at all). Most people seem to understand, but there are three distinct reservations where they didn't quite grasp the concept.\n\n**Story 1: \"You will not charge me a cancellation fee for cancelling. That's robbery\"**\n\nFor this first one, it was reserved for graduation weekend, which is the most sought after weekend for hotels (our waitlist typically outnumbers our total amount of possible rooms 3:1, and we have like 70 rooms too). For this event, we also had a two night minimum.\n\nWe had one cancellation about five months before graduation, but it was scheduled for checking out Saturday and not the typical Friday & Saturday night, checking out Sunday reservations for that weekend.\n\nWe checked our reservations wait-list document and at the time had 2 of the 40+ total potential reservations on there who needed a Thursday & Friday Night. My manager (who was working Front Desk alone one particular morning) said she called the first name in the queue. From what she said, the guy desperately needed the room and would gladly take it. He took it after the price was stated, kept saying he won't cancel when my manager was explaining the cancellation policy that is in bold above. Reservation made, confirmation email sent to him, second name in queue was never called.\n\nFast forward about two days and it is my afternoon shift. I get a call from someone wanting to cancel his reservation as he saw the price on the confirmation email and said it was more expensive than the room he booked at a different hotel (yes, he did say that). I ask his name and check-in date & check to see if it is a 3rd party or not. I see a staff note from my manager stating that she said the cancellation policy & what it was (had someone new at the time who was getting used to it). I tell the gentleman that I will happily cancel, but we are charging the cancellation fee. He went apeshit.\n\n\"What do you mean you're charging a cancellation fee? I'm checking in Thursday. It's free.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but you are staying Friday as well, which defaults to our special event cancellation policy.\"\n\n\"You will not charge me a cancellation fee for cancelling. That's robbery. I was not told about this when booking.\"\n\nI knew that my manager did tell him since she would never forget and even wrote it in the staff notes. \"Sir, our front desk agents are trained to tell all guests the cancellation policy for special event weekends, and it does say it on your confirmation email too.\"\n\n\"That's bullshit! If I knew, I wouldn't have booked it. I booked this one just in case as it is closer than my other hotel.\"\n\n\"I understand why you are cancelling, but this is our policy and we are not making an exception. We have it in place so people don't hoard rooms during weekends where our waitlist outnumbers our total rooms.\" That last part, which I don't know if I should've said or not, makes him mad since that is exactly what he did, only realizing that (by his own words during that call) that we are charging around $100 more than the other hotel he was holding a room. That is valid. We do upcharge event weekends like the other hotels in the area, but it is supply & demand as well as location too.\n\nHe threatens to call corporate to have them cancel for him and I gladly give the number. Corporate calls about ten minutes later on a three-way call w\/ the guest and I explain everything including our policy, why we do it, what the guest said to me on the phone about holding a room while he was booked at a different hotel only to cancel days later because he realized price isn't worth location, and that the cancellation not only is posted everywhere online, but that we told him during booking & it is stated in writing on his confirmation email. They thanked me for the info and told the guest that he could keep the room or take the cancellation policy. He cancelled, called us thieves, and wrote a nasty review about us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Story 2: \"What do you mean you can't cancel?\"**\n\nFootball weekend now, and I promise shorter story.\n\nI'm working afternoon again. It's the Saturday before a football weekend, so six days before the Friday of said event weekend. I get a call from someone asking how many rooms they had booked for the football weekend. I told her four. She wants to cancel two of them. I look and see they were booked on our hotel's website itself, which for context does have our event weekend cancellation policy posted. She also made these reservations about a half year prior to this call\n\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am, but even if I do cancel these, you won't be getting your money back from them.\"\n\nShe gets confused and slightly angry. \"What do you mean I won't be getting a refund? I'm not checking in until Friday. It states that your weekend policy is three days before check-in.\"\n\nShe's not completely wrong; that is our weekend policy is 3 days prior if checking in any day Friday-Sunday. I tell her that while yes, that is our weekend policy, that doesn't include event weekends and while you were booking it states the cancellation policy for said weekend.\n\n\"I've stayed there many times and you always tell me it is 3 days prior.\" That explained what's going on: she assumed it was the same cancellation policy for every weekend and didn't bother reading it for that weekend. I tell her again that if you book during an event weekend, you need to cancel 7+ days out otherwise you won't get a refund for cancelling.\n\nAfter a little more back and forth, I flat out tell her, \"look, you are not getting your money back. It is your choice to have those two rooms or pay for absolutely nothing.\" She kept the two rooms. She had a half year to decide to cancel, but chose to do it within the no-no zone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Story 3: \"Aww, I thought you were cool\"**\n\nOne final, quick story happened during graduation again, but a different year. It is the Friday where everyone is checking in and I'm working the morning shift. A guy comes in around noon says he has a reservation. Get his name and says he has ten rooms. I tell him that and he says \"Yeah, I booked ten rooms just in case family could make it for graduation, but they can't make it and I just need the one. You're good with cancelling them though for free, It's early and you can re-sell them.\"\n\nUmm, absolutely not. It's literally the day of check-in on the most sought after weekend when our wait list had over 150 names on it (with more that didn't want to go on the list). I had zero patience, especially since he assumed.\n\n\"Sir, you held 15% of our rooms and are cancelling the day of when we've been sold out for almost a year. I'm sorry, but there is no way you are getting a refund.\n\n\"Aww, I thought you were cool. I had a $100 tip for you if you did it.\" He kept the rooms and I called my manager about it. She said add him to DNR because this apparently wasn't the first time he tried something like this and he tried bribing staff to cancel a football reservation a year prior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Long stories short, know the cancellation policy and don't argue when you try to get away with shit.**","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1672017765.0},{"title":"It really is the little things...a wholesome tale","author":"tiotio109","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zvcw1d\/it_really_is_the_little_thingsa_wholesome_tale\/","text":"So, much like some front desk agents here, I was assigned to work a PM shift for Christmas.

The airlines were encouraging people since Monday to reschedule their flights because the storm was predicted to be so bad and waived all fees. It seems like nobody changed their flights because Buffalo is buried in a ton of snow and all the roads are closed. But sure we ruined their Christmas because they lived under a rock.

The ship left without them, and they didn\u2019t buy travel insurance. Of course it was our fault because they could have flown out on Wednesday, but that would have required a couple of extra days of lodging somewhere else.

The interstate was closed due to a multi-vehicle accident, and dozens of semi trucks had to travel on the main road. It took an hour to reach places you\u2019d normally be able to reach in 15 minutes. People were cranky and stranded, so it was fairly busy last night. \n\nMy shift was about to end at 11:00 that night, and things had finally settled down a bit. I was briefing my coworker on what he needed to know before I left when suddenly our emergency alarms all started going off. \n\nMy immediate thought was that someone was smoking in their room and set off the trouble alarm. Unfortunately that was not the case. The information screen on our alarm box told me that the sprinkler system had overloaded, and as I looked out into the entryway, I see water pouring down from the ceiling. Shit. \n\nAnd it was coming down *fast*. In less than a minute, water was seeping through the walls and into the office. I ran to the phone and dialed 9 1 1 and told them what was happening. They sent out the fire department and told me that I needed to evacuate the building and keep people away from the water and elevator. I tried calling both of my managers multiple times but with no success. Left a frantic voicemail for each of them, and I was getting pissed that I couldn\u2019t get ahold of them. \n\nI instructed my coworker to get up to the second and third floors to start evacuating people. Meanwhile there\u2019s now a crowd in the lobby and people are sticking their heads out of their rooms to see what\u2019s going on. What probably annoyed me most about the whole situation was the people who were standing in the water near the entryway and taking pictures. Get away from the fucking entryway, you idiots. Stop taking pictures and leave like I told you to. \n\nBy now there was a few inches of water in the office, lobby, entryway, and hallway. I was sloshing through it with soaked socks and shoes. I went down the hallway and told people they needed to evacuate at the advisement of the fire department.\n\nAnd this lady. This one lady. Standing in the doorway of her room with her arms crossed. She got snotty and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d I told her that she had to leave. She said no. I told her she\u2019d be put on the DNR list. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t care, if the building isn\u2019t burning down then I\u2019m not leaving. This is [name of town], nothing\u2019s going to happen. And I paid for this room so I\u2019m staying here.\u201d \n\nAt this point I was so pissed off. How entitled do you have to be\u2026 there was a handful of people watching this go down, the alarm was blaring, I\u2019m standing in inches of cold water, the fire department still wasn\u2019t there yet because the roads were so bad, and this bitch was being snotty about evacuating.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help myself. I deadass looked at this woman and yelled, \u201cI don\u2019t give a FUCK what you think!\u201d And she stepped back into her room and slammed her door shut. I made the crowd get out. \n\nLike I know it\u2019s cold and windy outside you guys. I\u2019m sorry, I empathize, but there\u2019s wiring and outlets and other electrical stuff that\u2019s exposed to water right now and I have a legal obligation to manage risk and evacuate the building in the event of an emergency. I told them the fire department was on the way. And let me be clear: the alarm system told me the sprinklers overloaded. It didn\u2019t indicate a fire. But electrical components were being submerged and I had no idea what was going on inside the ceilings and walls that caused the overload in the first place. My manager wants guests to evacuate in an emergency, and the emergency operator advised the same. \n\nI finally got ahold of the general manager and told him what was going on, so he was on his way there to help. The fire department *finally* arrived, checked out the building, looked at the sprinklers, and shut off the main water system until they could find the specific problem and shutoff point. \n\nThey told me that a pipe burst above the entryway and that\u2019s what caused the overload alarm and flooding. I\u2019m guessing it burst because of the cold. They shut off the sprinkler system and then turned the main water back on. They gave me further instructions and said I could let people back in now and then left just as my manager arrived.\n\nMy manager walked into the office, and I told him right away, \u201clook, I\u2019m just gonna tell you right now I told a lady that I didn\u2019t give a fuck what she thought because she refused to leave the building. Fire me if you must.\u201d\n\nHe did not fire me. And I\u2019m not sure if that lady complained when she checked out this morning, but I guess I\u2019ll find out when I go back into work today. Last night was crazy trying to get the alarm company on the phone, cleanup services, and someone to fix the sprinkler because we couldn\u2019t operate without a working sprinkler system (though short term we could as long as someone was constantly patrolling the hallways for fires and the information was disclosed to any incoming guests).\n\nBut yeah, imagine being so snotty and entitled that you refuse to evacuate the building in the event of an emergency- at the instruction of an employee, no less- because you paid for the room and, dammit, you\u2019ll stay in that room if you want to. I mean, what would she have done if there actually was a fire? Hang out in her $100 room as the building burned down and her along with it? A hundred bucks isn\u2019t exactly the monetary rate at which you\u2019d be willing to go down with the ship.\n\nSo, Merry Christmas to everyone except that woman.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1671982162.0},{"title":"Worst.

Apologies if this is too long, I have been told I can be a long winded storyteller. From September to December last year, my hotel was having the worst time trying to find someone to help our FD Manager B. In comes J. Now, J had previously applied for a sales position at the hotel back in October. However, she never completed the new hire training required by corporate before she could be officially called an employee (not to mention some red flags on her background check).\n\nBy the end of November, she has finally settled everything with us. But we couldn't wait any longer and filled the sales position. So, management asked her if she would instead like to take up the position of FD supervisor. She happily agreed, and thus my semi-peaceful nights were to be filled with her. \n\nHow things were before (and pretty much after J got hired and before I got promoted) was that I would work nights with my FD manager B. I say \"with\" loosely, as I did work the front desk by myself, and he often did who knows what on his laptop in his office. Now, for the most part, this did not bother me, as I was (am) extremely efficient as a FD agent and can be quite specific in how I want things done. Not one bad review, let me just say.\n\nSo, J gets hired on, and I am in charge of training her, as I am the most knowledgeable person when it comes to our POS system and hotel amenities\/happenings. My initial thought of J was that she was quite slobish looking. But I try to judge a person based on their work ethic rather than their appearance, thus ignoring that. Not even the first night together, she proves herself to be a difficult case. After 10 minutes into our shift, she walks away from me as I explain tier levels to her and sits on an ottoman in front of our desk. Obviously, I stop explaining things and she tells me to continue, it was just that medically (I really don't think this was the case even a year later) she could not stand for more than 20 minutes and was winded after having to walk downstairs and back up to clock in.\n\n20 minutes. First off, you just chose the wrong job. I typically never took a break because I was the only person at the desk, and when I did leave, I got called back almost immediately because B (or is I actually had another FD agent with me) needed help.\n\nI don't say anything to J, and just continue explaining perks and the like as she lounges in front of me. Eventually, a guest comes around to check in. J, to her credit, got up and went to watch me do the check in process. Unfortunately for me, this is when I learned she had no idea what personal space was. She was standing right next to me, arm to hip, connecting with my back. Again, I didn't say or do anything and checked the guy in. After he leaves, I plan on having her try to repeat back to me what I did, but again she leaves to sit. Add in her 30-minute smoke breaks (4 times in an 8-hour shift), and this is basically my life for the next 3 weeks.\n\nNow you may be asking, \"ASadExistence, why didn't you say anything?\" Well, nothing really changed about my work life, I was already doing the work of 2-3 agents and liked keeping busy. I also didn't have to; everyone knew how horrible she was. I tried my best to train her, but when she did have morning shifts, it was a disaster (let alone the 2 times she was left alone during those shifts; I still cry thinking about all the stuff I had to fix when my shift came).\n\nWe were already short-staffed (only 4 agents and B and J) and December from start to finish was absolutely insane. So, management bit their tongue and prayed to find someone else to hopefully replace her. Much to the chagrin of the other three agents (two of whom decided to ignore her and the other openly threatened to fight her every time they interacted), this left poor me as the only one who could pretend to tolerate her for the sake of a peaceful work environment. So, because I was the only one who would talk to her (I say this loosely; all I would say was \"uh huh's and really's\"). There were glorious stories about her crazy ass family (her 16-year-old daughter engaged to a 23-year-old man who was having trouble finding work and ended up moving in with them! Like what! I desperately want to vomit even thinking back to that).\n\nBut it all comes to a head at our massive employee holiday party, which we throw a few days before the new year. I had to work (shocker), but J decided to go and quite literally throw down. She had so much booze that I was sure I would find her frozen dead in the alleyway upon leaving my shift. But instead, she drunkenly stumbles back to the desk and asks if I have any rooms she could sleep in because she couldn't drive home. I told her that she would have to ask management if she could sleep here, because I could only do it if she paid. She said okay and walked away, never to be seen from by me again.\n\nI found out after having two days off, that the next day housekeeping had found her in a vacant dirty room with one of the dishwashers from the kitchen (also a creep). She had decided to use B's laptop to find a room and used her manager's key to open it up for their escapades. I cannot tell you how much I laughed in private, I still laugh thinking about it (room 604, you have seen horrors). She was promptly fired and escorted off property by our GM who took all her keys.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1671806389.0},{"title":"Weekly Free For All Thread","author":"marmothelm","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zu27qg\/weekly_free_for_all_thread\/","text":"Want to talk about something that isn't a front desk tale?

Rentals are not the main reason people come to our location, just a side thing we offer, we are a tourist destination. I am the person who works the registration desk and books these rentals. I had a guy who wanted to book a \"surprise wedding\". Who was it a surprise for? The bride of course!\n\nThe plan was to propose, then immediately walk her to another part of the facility and have her change into a wedding dress (in a public bathroom because we aren't set up for dressing before weddings, and maybe not even a dress she picked out?) and walk into her own wedding with 100 guests waiting. I begged my boss to not let this happen and there were too many things that could go horribly wrong and this poor woman would have no say in any part of her own wedding.\n\nShe might either initially say no to a proposal (then what do we do with the 100 guests? and I'm certainly not offering any refunds!) Or she could say yes then rescind when she realized what was going on. My boss said to still do it if they signed all the paperwork and paid. \n\nThe guy came in with several people, i'm assuming his family members, to do a walkthrough and plan this. A week or two goes by with me getting emails from vendors about his event for alcohol and things. I was leaving voicemails and emailing him repeatedly that he needs to actually sign paperwork with me and pay as he has not reserved anything with us yet. At that point, anyone could take the date still and he should NOT be contacting vendors or signing\/paying anything with them at this stage, it is inappropriate and I\u2019m the venue he hasn\u2019t booked.\n\nThen I get him on the phone FINALLY like 2 weeks after he came in, in person and he says \"oh, I thought someone would have called you... we won't be needing the space\".... so I gave it to one of the other four people calling me about that date. I do not know if she caught wind and shut it down or even if they are still together after that stunt. What was the reason he wanted to do this? They had some relatives not doing so well health-wise and he wanted to speed up the marriage process so they could attend but didn\u2019t talk to his would-be fianc\u00e9 turned same day bride about it beforehand.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1671744560.0},{"title":"Thank you!","author":"RambleMan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zsqjcq\/thank_you\/","text":"Watching the monster storm move into Eastern Canada (and yes, the U.S.), this morning I cancelled my surprise visit to my mom figuring she doesn't know I'm coming so there won't be any disappointment if I choose to not travel into weather\/driving danger.\n\nAnyway, after I cancelled the flight and car rental I tried cancelling tonight's hotel I had booked part way through the drive, but because we're within 24 hours, I couldn't cancel online.

I take that to mean porn and our Wi-Fi won\u2019t load porn but I don\u2019t say that.

She missed today's shift because her spouse was in the ER. Our FD manager was loved dearly by everyone in FD staff except 1 person. 6 out of 9 of my coworkers quit when they heard the news, since corporate had been harassing our FD manager for almost 2 months now and she was also on FMLA leave. I walked out when my other manager\\* asked me to work on a day I had already requested off (when I said no I was told we would \"talk about it later\"), laughed while announcing our FD manager was fired, and abandoned me at the desk when I asked for help since I had no one else there.

Now there are only 2 FD workers left, and 1 of them just got another job offer and is leaving town on the 23rd. The other will most likely become our new FD manager, which solidified my decision to leave since they often slack off, infantilize me, never has a nice thing to say, and talks shit about all my other coworkers.\n\nOur FD manager was planning on working doubles through Christmas just so we were able to spend time with our families, and now she won't be working there at all. In fact, no one will be there to work Christmas because we are tired of putting up with the constant drama, violence, low pay, rooms not being cleaned and then lied about by housekeeping, backhanded comments, and broken equipment that no one cares to fix\/replace.

Right as I'm starting my shift duties (counting the register that's been short for a month now) this red truck pulls in and an older man comes in and asks for a rate of a single. I tell him the rate and he starts to argue that it's cheaper online. Well book online then?? \nHe goes back out to his truck and leaves no surprise so I go get started with my room checks. As I'm checking rooms I see his truck pull up again and curse him in my head because it's always when I leave the lobby that people show up. I head back and he tells me he made a reservation so I go in and start the check in process and ask for his ID and he hesitates and says he has a reservation at another hotel in another town 2 hours from here and tells me his daughter is trying to cancel the other reservation. I'm beyond confused at this point and ask him if he's going to check in here or not and he says he wants to wait. Bruh. Like what's the point of making 2 reservations? I also told him that if he didn't check in here I would unfortunately charge him for a no show because I'm unable to cancel reservations the day of. He ends up checking in half an hour later. \n\nLiterally right after this another truck pulls up and an older gentleman and a young man come up to the window we have  (I've locked the door at this point) and ask to check into a single. I tell them the rate and they say ok so I ask for an ID and they tell me none of them have an ID. But oh wait! They have it on their phone conveniently. I tell them absolutely not and that we require a physical ID present at check in. The older man starts to argue about how another hotel he's stayed at lets him check in without one. Great! Go stay over there tonight. They walked off and I closed the window. They waited in the parking lot for a couple of minutes before driving off and I thought that was the last of dealing with stupid people for tonight. But oh I was so wrong.\n\nI was sitting down doing some work and a guest knocked on the window and said that there was a guy knocking on every door asking for people to rent a room for him. I instantly know it's the younger guy from before and tell her I'll handle it. As I was about to call the non emergency number I see him walking up to the window. This is where the fun starts. I open the window and he asks, AGAIN, if he could rent a room and I said fuck no. I told him I know he's knocking on peoples rooms and asking for them to rent to him and because someone already complained, I'm not renting to him at all even if he somehow comes up with an ID. I told him to leave the property before I call police. He starts arguing that he's stayed here before and that he knows my coworker (who lives on property) and another guest who stays here often (who is also check in atm) and I tell him none of that matters and that he needs to leave right now. He walks off and I call the police anyways and give them his description and ask for them to patrol the area. \n\nThe cops did swing by a bit after the phone call and asked me a couple questions about the guy and told me if he comes again to call them immediately. Fortunately the guy never came back but our sister hotel down the road dealt with him a while after I did and their front desk called me to ask what was up because they also called the cops on that guy. I ended up calling the other hotels in the area to warn them about him. \n\nWhat the heck honestly lol.

It was past my shift but I was actually being hosted in one of the rooms at my hotel for reduced price because I was in the process of moving and my bosses trusted me. Also, if I was there I could cover lunches and the like which the bosses would use that money and time to count towards my rent so I wouldn\u2019t have to pay as much.\n\nThey really are awesome.\n\nAnywho, so while I\u2019m in my room in my casual sleepwear, I get a call from my coworker that goes something like this:\n\n\u201cYARN, can you please come down for five minutes?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 Sure, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a guest who has been yelling at me for ten minutes and I am about five seconds away from screaming back.\u201d\n\nWith that, I scrambled about the room and donned my work outfit, smoothed out as many disheveled characteristics as humanely possible in a few seconds,  and sprinted \u2014 as quietly as I could \u2014 for the elevators. I get down in record time to see two women yelling at my coworker and I arrive and he looks relieved as he directs me to them.\n\nSo as it turns out they insisted that we had an application on our computer that could help them print out some pdf or something and they wanted to hop on our terminals.\n\nWe did not have the application.\n\nI \u2014 apparently repeating verbatim what my coworker said \u2014 explained that we were happy to let them use the business center to send us any printouts, we cannot let them use out Front Desk Terminals. They protested that the computer didn\u2019t have the application, I replied that neither did our FD terminals and we were unable to download any applications without the administrator password which neither of us possessed. They literally grumbled about how odd it was that we didn\u2019t have the application and strolled out the door.\n\nMy coworker stared in bafflement and could only utter, \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d\n\nI wish I knew my friend, I wish I knew.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1671602026.0},{"title":"Guest getting mad that we have no upgrades","author":"hannnsolo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheFrontDesk\/comments\/zqvnrn\/guest_getting_mad_that_we_have_no_upgrades\/","text":"Blows my mind that guests get upset that we have no upgrades available at one in the morning!\n\nAnd they\u2019re all trying to get them for free.\n\nI tell them I\u2019m sorry we\u2019re sold out we have no upgrades available and then they think I\u2019m lying to them, trying to give me a story of why they need the upgrade\n\nI can\u2019t give you what I don\u2019t have \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI had a guest trying to get a comp upgrade saying they really needed a room with a full size fridge with the freezer and how they bought all this food and everything.

We've all been there.\n\nIt's summer. You're sold out and it's almost check in time. The lobby is filled with guests but the head housekeeper is running behind and hasn't given you the ok to check most of the rooms in quite yet. Kids are running amok through the lobby, in and out through the front door, parents are screaming at their kids and dads and couples are packed in, standing in line waiting to be the first to get into their rooms once check in time hits in 10 minutes. You aren't as optimistic about the rooms being ready for all of them, but you're smiling just the same, pretending it will all go as planned.\n\nWe've all been there if you work the front desk.\n\nOn one of these sunny summer days, with the lobby packed just as I've described, I noticed one kid was being even more rambunctious than most - running in and out of the front door, shouting at her brother - a bit maniacal really, but nothing too crazy. Just a kid excited to be checking into a hotel that has a pool.\n\nThen it happened.\n\nThe kid rips open the front door, runs right into the middle of all the guests standing there on their phones, and she yells at the top of her voice:\n\n\"Siri! Call 911!\"\n\nEvery Iphone in the lobby started making an emergency call. The girl laughed and laughed and then ran back out the front door, pulling her brother in tow.\n\nSmart kid.

Luckily I had a pepper spray on me and gave it to her to use as protection because that\u2019s the second time this weird guy pulled up on her.

The front desk has access to reading them and our manager regularly briefs us over patterns or something that she thinks needs to be addressed. There\u2019s one review from over the summer we still make jokes about.\n\nA woman rated our hotel 5\/10. Did she receive bad service? No, everyone was pleasant. Was the room subpar? No, it was clean and cozy. Our mattresses are amazing according to her. She had two complaints that brought our score down so low. The first one being our parking fee. The second\u2026\n\nWe have a lot with a parking gate. The lot wraps around our hotel and there\u2019s an entrance into the hotel from each side. She claims that she was rolling her suitcase from the parking lot into our main lobby instead of a side entrance. Apparently the gate\u2019s arm *fell onto her head.*\n\nI\u2019m telling you, if that happened to me, no one would ever know. I\u2019d make sure no one saw and bring that to my grave. The arm stays up for a solid twenty seconds and lowers at a snail\u2019s pace. And it\u2019s thin. Most people would have to aim themselves and wait patiently for the arm to lower to get hit on the head. Not only did she actually admit this happened, she blamed our hotel and gave us a 5\/10 score for it.\n\nOur GM never gave us access to the camera that would have filmed it, not for lack of pleading on our part. But when a negative review comes in without any further explanation from the guest, we assume they got hit on the head with the parking gate.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1671544526.0}]
