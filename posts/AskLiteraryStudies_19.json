        "text": "It's often said that \"The Wasteland\" by T.S. Eliot helped usher in the modern age of literature. In your studies, or perhaps personal opinion, what other works are the type representative of their historic and philosophical movement? To make things more interesting, please include prose and poetry (and theatre, if you wish) for each description.\n\nEdit: The answers to my question have been fantastic. I've learned a lot by reading what each of you had to say, and I'm grateful for it. The first subject to address will be the fundamental problem with my question, as you all have brought to my attention: that literature, as we know it, cannot be categorised so easily.\n\nUnderstand that I am a student and professional of natural resource management, so I claim no truly informed understanding of literature as a discipline. This is me attempting to change that.\n\nBack to the task at hand. Throughout my schooling, literature lessons have referenced specific movements, such as \"modernism\" or \"transcendentalism\" or \"romanticism\" and so on... Some of these are bound by antiquity in time, and some could be emulated today. So here is my revised inquiry: what is a literary movement, what are the best examples of such, and again, what might a layman read to get the *'best example'* of each? In my native jargon: What is the type species of each phylogenetic group? ",

Godwin's writing was heavily informed by the political goings-on of the time in Europe, and his work (political philosophy as well as fiction) was incredibly influential during the first half of the 18th century. \n\nHere's what William Hazlitt had to say of Godwin, and Caleb Williams, in his essay entitled *The Spirit of the Age*: “[Godwin] was in the very zenith of a sultry and unwholesome popularity; he blazed as a sun in the firmament of reputation; no one was more talked of, more looked up to, more sought after, and wherever liberty, truth, justice was the theme, his name was not far off—now he has sunk below the horizon, and enjoyed the serene twilight of a doubtful immortality.” Hazlitt wrote that \"no one ever began Caleb Williams that did not read it through: no one that ever read it could possibly forget it, or speak of it after any length of time but with an impression as if the events and feelings had been personal to himself.\"\n\n\nWhy has barely any layman today even heard of Godwin, and why is Caleb Williams not more widely appreciated by literature enthusiasts and scholars?\n\n\n",

I have a theory that this had bled into modern Indian society and has not only affected the concept of femininity in an overly patriarchal nation, but has ruined our ability to love.\n\n Sort of like Alain de boton's theory of romantic love ruining practical doable love in today's times, but with this specific cultural context. Although Tagore was influenced by a lot of romantic writers who had this idea of romantic love comprising soulmates and perfect comprehension between them, I don't know how to find a link between boton's theory and mine since\nA) boton writes fictional novels and not pure philosophical theory so I don't even know where to begin to compare the two\nB) I can't seem to find a more nationalist equivalent of romance and romantic love in the Indian context which would make more sense in my theory, as it wasn't just Tagore's writing that influenced women - I sense it in so many more Indian writers pieces written about women and I can't explain it.\n\nWould you have any other philosopher who talks in more detail or has similar ideas to de boton?

Its set in the first decade of the 20th century when Bengal was being split in two and the Swadeshi movement for independence was spreading like wildfire.\n\nEven when she has an affair with his best friend, the brain behind the movement in the book, there is less focus on the actual relationship - not a single mention of physical encounters - the only narrative revolves around the morality of this ideal of love that each of them tries to live up to, in this case her relationship with her husband, and lamenting over what she's done but what she now feels capable of.\n\nThe thing that strikes me most about this book, and annoys me a lot most of the time, is the devotional, almost religious quality of love between her and her husband - she touches his feet at 4 am before he wakes up and caters to his every whim etc. This self sacrificial, Sita - like attitude towards love is something that I feel penetrates itself into sections of Indian society even today - I see in my mother and most of the other army housewives and mothers do friends in their generation and the one before it.\n\nI would really appreciate it if you have any literature or any philosophers that talk about this sort of love, where affection and attraction are symptoms that appear once you give into this idea of love as an ideal, righteous duty one must give in to and be subservient to. If you cheat on your significant other and this duty, then you suffer Christian like guilt ( the best kind innit.)\n\nConsidering how it is culture specific, if you have any literature on this sort of love in the Indian context that would be great too!\n\nBonus - she also begins to confuse her love for her lover with the heady propaganda being fed to her by him where he likes her to a goddess that everyone must look upto to manifest their abstract love for their nation. Anything on love as propaganda would be great too.\n\nAll other advice and ideas welcome, sorry if I spoiled the story for you.",

        "text": "I've just finished my first reading of* Brave New World* - something occurred to me whilst I was reading it (and after thinking about previous utopian/dystopian texts which I have read in the past); the function of currency in BNW seems to be glossed over, but from what I have understood, it is a hyper-consumerist reality, where all forms of recycling is completely discouraged... \"ending is better than mending\". It is at the point where even the individual has been reified to maintain the status-quo. \n\nThis got me thinking about other utopian texts; More's *Utopia*, Bellamy's *Looking Backward 2000*, Gilman's *Herland* and Hawthorne's *Blithedale*. In each of these texts, with perhaps the exception of Blithdale, the author takes the time to elucidate the complex economic systems which maintain their respective utopias. \n\nHopefully, this isn't too much of a leap - I began to think about how the economic systems of utopian and dystopian literature are actually rather similar; take, for instance, Huxley's world, which seems a bastardisation of Bellamy's Boston. 2000's world is supported by the precise machinations of the state, who have acted responsibly and utilised the industrial army to the betterment of all humanity - whereas, in Huxley's new world, the similarly statist government rather malevolently indoctrinates its workers into their subservient positions (or otherwise) in order to support a similar economic system, leaned towards consumerism. The morality of both systems may, of course, be debated but logistically they seem to function in a similar way. I suppose you could even argue that the Bellamy economy is dystopian, in that everyone is 'forced' to use the central warehouses to purchase their goods from.\n\nOr, I'm completely misunderstanding this point? I was looking for some literature on the subject but it appears to be quite a niche topic. ",

My GPA is not likely good enough to jump right into a PhD program, let alone a preferable one; therefore, I'm planning on a Masters first. \n\nI am very much in love with literature, philosophy, and cultural studies/critical theory. Unfortunately, lit theory, my favorite crossroads at which to sit, seems to be less prominent in US schools. Most programs seem to have sections on cultural theory, but do not focus on it. \n\nWhen researching, I found a thread on /r/criticaltheory that suggested Goldsmiths. Upon reviewing their modules, I don't think I could find a better fit. For the first time, I was wondering which ones I would have to sacrifice rather than which ones I would be forced to put up with. \n\nHas anyone here been involved with this school? Does anyone know anything about it? Their site isn't super telling, and I can't find a ton online about the program.\n\nMy biggest questions:\n\n- is this school too prestigious to consider applying? (like Oxford or Brown)\n\n- is this school recognized enough to help me in possible later PhD applications?\n\n- is $14,200 for a one year fulltime program too much for a literature/humanities degree? (is that a fair price comparatively &amp; is that a manageable/justifiable level of debt to handle later on)\n\n- Is there anything else I should consider here? Is studying theory, in light of its apparent decline in popularity, still worth pursuing?\n\n- Are there other schools, maybe even in the US that have a theory heavy masters program? (I know Berkeley and the New School focus on theory, but idk about a Masters or if I could even get in)\n\nI know I could ask these things in /r/gradadmissions, but since it's so specifically focused, I thought I'd try here first.

        "text": "So, for an undergraduate German literature essay, the title/topic for which we've to invent by ourselves, I wanted to examine Kafka's *Die Verwandlung* (and maybe some other short prose by him (*Die Sorge des Hausvaters, Ein Landarzt, das Urteil*, etc.) using Kristeva's theory of abjection. In her *Pouvoirs de l'Horreur* from 1980 (trans. 1982 as Powers of Horror, an Essay on Abjection) she discusses how various modern authors go about dealing with this phenomenon. She mentions Kafka only in passing, as one of those who *could have* guided her 'descent into the hell of naming' (p.207). I've chosen abjection as I'd been hovering around the first 1/2 chapters for a few months, totally fascinated by her beautiful style, so I wanted to explore the work fully and try and apply it to something done in college, and poor Gregor Samsa seems at times like the most abject thing in all of literature. \n\nSo, here's my question. **Does anyone have any advice on applying this theory to a text?** Obviously I will take content into account (Gregor's monstrous body and its flows, his crossing over the internal 'borders' of the apartment, his loss of language, etc.). Would you consider Kafka's style abject? The tone of narration, how the characters always seem unimpressed by the fantastic events taking place? Should reader response be considered? There were times when I was physically cringing when poor Gregor was stuck in the doorway for example. I'm aware that interpreting Kafka is a tricky task, and reducing him to Metaphors (e.g. Gregor's abject body is a metaphor for the marxist notion of alienation etc.) can hinder a discussion. Hence I'm not sure about simply reading the story as 'Family = Self in formation, Gregor = abjection through which it establishes itself etc.). Should an 'abject' reading read the text literally? Should the author's life &amp; attitude be taken into account (Kafka's *Letters to Felice* includes reflections on writing that describe his creative process as a way of escaping failure and not being only 'fit for the dustbin' ('wert hinausgekehrt zu werden'), should it examine a combination of socio-economic/societal (/outer world) influences of the time with the psyche (inner world) of the protagonist?\n\nI'm asking because there doesn't seem to be any set 'checklist' of abject things, and Kristeva's analysis in chapter one shows that authors differ in their approach to this (for Joyce its the 'nonsensical' music in Finnegan's Wake or the female semiotic voice of Molly Bloom etc., for Artaud it's 'an \"I\" overcome by the corpse' etc. (25)), so I'm trying to figure out what abjection would mean for Kafka, and I'm thinking that it's his protagonists uncanny acceptance of unrealistic occurrences, along with the loss of identity that often goes along with that, and also the 'loss of meaning' in style/form (the ambivalence of the 'Ungeziefer' creature, or Odradek in *Sorge des Hausvaters*, his writing of things that generally defy interpretations etc.). \n\nI'd be grateful for any insights, reading recommendations etc. Thanks for reading! \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I tried posting this in askphilosophy about a week ago, and it's seems that not many people over there are interested in this question so I will try here. Quick Intro: I don't know much about Foucault or what kind of reception this essay got, so any information on that would be helpful.\n\n\nSo, I came to this essay because I had been reading some of Bataille's essays and then Story of the Eye, and all this got me curious about transgressive literature and transgression in general. So it seems to me that Foucault links transgression with sexuality, and even though we live in a society that apparently holds nothing as sacred, sexuality is not liberated but \"denatured by language.\" If transgression is about crossing the limit, and the relationship between these two is like a spiral, then it would seem that the limit is always changing, or being \"contested\". What I think Foucault is getting at is that this is supposed to liberate language (and apparently this has some consequences for philosophy), but I am stumped on a few things.\n\n\n* What does he mean when he refers to \"non-discursive language\". It seems like he uses this term interchangeably with non-dialectical.\n\n\n* What does Foucault mean by the breakdown of philosophical subjectivity (and what is the consequence of this)? He refers to a multiplicity of speaking subjects, which I take to mean that any philosopher must engage with the history of philosophy, so in a sense, his words are not entirely his own.\n\n\n* Is Foucault suggesting that literature is a way of freeing up philosophical language? Is that the importance he ascribes to Bataille and Sade? That fiction is a way of \"shattering the philosophical subject\" and disengaging the \"I\" who speaks?\n\n\nI'd appreciate any insight on this. I think it's a very interesting essay, it seems to be a kind of critique of the dialectical method (at least as it pertains to sexuality), but I'm still not sure what to make of all this.",

        "text": "Hello, all. I am a undergrad student of literature at a German university. Currently, I am working on my bachelor's thesis, but have recently struggled to make any real progress and my deadline is coming closer.\n\nThis post could have been titled \"How to write a bachelor's thesis\" but I've come to believe that my struggle is specific to the subject of literature and since this is an amazing sub which I love to lurk on, I thought maybe I would get some useful pointers here.\n\nLet me start with a couple of words about my project. I am analysing some pieces of short prose by an avantgarde author from the 1920s. My basic approach is looking at the texts in the context of their publication, i.e. a regional newspaper. In a way, this thesis is an exercise in material philology as coined by Stephen Nichols, but applied to a modern context. This is an approach I'm familiar with, but I haven't written an extensive paper following this line of thought before.\n\nMy usual approach to writing papers would be reading the subject text(s) until I found a problem/line of questioning which I found interesting, then find relevant scholarly literature. After identifying some trends in previous readings, I would incorporate arguments I found convincing into my own reading, finding refutations for those I did not. Usually, a structured overall argument would evolve quite naturally from this engagement with secondary literature.\n\nHowever, I found myself unable to apply this modus operandi on my bachelor's thesis, and now I'm struggling with structuring my work to the point where I've developed a serious writer's block. One of my main problems is that the texts I am analysing are rather unknown; there are no previous readings with which to engage. This is not hyperbolic speaking; while plenty of scholarly work has been done on this author, I have only been able to find one instance where one of the texts I write about was mentioned in passing, and that's it. On the one hand, this allows me to spend more time working on the actual subject matter as opposed to dwelling over other scholarly opinions. On the other hand, not having to engage with differing readings seems to leave my enquiry entirely open-ended, and I seem unable to come up with a framework that structures both my argumentation and my actual work on writing the thesis.\n\nThis is in part, I think, also owed to the open-ended nature of the material approach; there's a million ways to do a material reading on a literary text published in a newspaper with various synchronic and diachronic contexts and paratexts. I have a line of questioning I am following: specifically I am looking into how negotiations both as a motif and as a structural aspect of the texts are highlighted by topics and themes in surrounding texts and how the literary texts function as commentary both on daily affairs and on the workings of the newspaper in regards to this. But simply listing textual examples and individual observations where this seems to be the case would hardly make a convincing argument, and I feel like I would only be skimming the surface without giving the texts a 'full' reading.\n\nMaybe I'm just anxious and overthinking how I approach my thesis, it is after all (in terms of length and scope) not much more than a glorified term paper. But without the natural structuring which comes with engaging with scholarly literature, I feel like I'm at a crossroads with every step I take, and never know which direction to take next.\n\nAny practical advice on how to get out of this blockage would be much appreciated; and if anyone is interested, I'd also be happy to discuss my subject matter and approach in more depth.",

I'm doing it on a South African novel by Zakes Mda called \"Heart of Redness\". The narrative is split between a colonial story of a umXhosa prophetess who envisions that if people slaughter all their cattle the dead will rise and give the amaXhosa new cattle and freedom from colonial rule.\n\nThe other narrative is about a village that is debating whether or not they should allow a casino to be built on their land. Part of the village sees this as opportunity and progress, the other part argues that it will destroy the natural landscape and won't provide any real opportunities for people in the village; who will just be used as cheap labour.\n\nI would like to write on the contrasts between ideas of progress, sustainable development, community, and especially how a land-centred approach brings together the community and builds connections between individuals and the land around them. Whereas the tourists have no real responsibility to the land. \n\nThere are wealthy white people who build cottages on the land by bribing a chief. They use the land as a leisure/pleasure space. Which contrasts with the people who live on and from the land.\n\nWhat I'm struggling with is finding theoretical support for these ideas. I've been considering ecocriticism, ecofeminism, ecosocialism— but these are broad fields that I have very little exposure in. I'd also considered looking at the narrative in terms of the pastoral but that doesn't focus enough on the inequality and social justice aspect. \n\nI'd appreciate it if you have any idea of theorists I could look at who deal with the relationship between people and the land, as vague as that may be.\n\nPs: My apologies for formatting, I'm on mobile.",

        "text": "I'm working on a writing sample for grad school applications, on Emily Dickinson, and more specifically her myth — how she is presented in collections, but also how she presents herself, or maybe more accurately stated, her self or selves separate from her subject (if I'm using that term right; trying to suss out the difference between subject and object as well). \n\nTo that end, the concept of performance and speaking as a character comes to mind. For example, in one of her letters to Thomas Wentworth Higginson (can't find it right now; sorry) she mentions her use of first-person pronouns as representative of characters, more or less — speakers that are separate from her living self, or at least not directly representative of her biographical person. Regardless of her own intent, the concept of performance is inevitably brought to mind in the situations she (or one of her selves?) speaks of — we don't actually think that she rides with Death in a carriage, for example; it is a fictional experience, with fictional personae, and therefore a fictional speaker.\n\nI suppose the question I'm circling is: What are the implications of this separation of living poet and speaker, considering especially Dickinson's biography as mythic and perhaps separate from the once-living Dickinson in its own right? What exactly do we take from her use of first-person pronouns, thinking specifically within the structure of her poetry? individual poems?\n\nI guess the follow-up to all that is: Who's a good critic or theorist to lean on? I know Susan Howe is huge in Dickinson-centric criticism, but I feel as though I should look into the theory of lyric poetry at large? Would Hegel's concept of lyricism be helpful in that regard? I have a book by Jonathan Culler literally called *The Theory of Lyric* that I'm browsing currently, looking for mentions of speaker and persona. \n\nI'm also looking into Barthes's model of myth-making (and I suppose author death?); Lacan and split subjectivity; and maybe even Derrida a bit, treating the speaker as a transcendental signifier? \n\nAnyone have any other leads? comments? questions? concerns?\n\nThank you all regardless!",

The notes make it clear the author is borrowing pretty heavily from Mircea Eliade. \n\nWhat I'd like from you, dear redditors, is your suggestion for a quick and dirty way to get into Eliade's work so I can show the underpinning of these ideas in my paper. I'd love to get deeply into Eliade's work eventually, but you know the situation -- I have a deadline and an ILL account. Thanks!",

        "text": "I posted about this a while ago. When I was in my undergrad, I had a wonderful prof that went completely out of his way to encourage me to submit an essay to a book series coming out of Brill. I genuinely believed, for a long time, that it was only accepted because no one else had submitted essays. In fact, the editor wrote me back and said, \"We're waiting to see if more people submit essays,\" a year into the process.\n\nIt has been three years since then, I believe, and both editors liked the project, told me they wanted to include it in the book, and sent it to the outside Brill reviewers who both recommended publication(though one wanted some edits). All in all, I've done four or five drafts; two required substantial editing. \n\nIs it possible that they no longer actually want my essay and are hoping that I drop out? They keep giving me helpful feedback, but I feel like I'm never quite hitting the mark. If I'm being honest, the argument is interesting but I'm not confident that it adds to the scholarship on the author, and I didn't realize that as an undergraduate, but I realize it now, in my first year of grad school. Obviously, I trust the editors (they are incredible scholars and I can't believe they're giving me the time of day, tbh), but I'm hoping that this isn't a situation where they realize how much the publication would mean to me and they just don't have the heart to tell me the paper is actually not working for them anymore.\n\nI do have a new prof that seems to like me and is a scholar on this author and I am wondering if I should ask him his thoughts on the paper and the editing situation.

I feel my explanation is way too shallow or way off the mark.\n\n\nApologies if this is the wrong place to post\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: the text is *The Coherence of Gothic Conventions* by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick\n\nThe quote is from near the end of chapter 1, titled: *The Structure of Gothic Conventions*, it analyses key features of Gothic using primarily *The Italian*, *The Monk* and *Melmoth the Wanderer* as examples. (I wasn't familiar with the stories so I could only really read of what the author included, I'm going to apply the features to *The Yellow Wallpaper* though) \n\nThank you for the responses, made me realise the X with in (side) and X with out (side) :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBigger portion of the quote (from p.g 50):\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt is, however, the stable crystalline relation, the one that enforces boundaries with a proscriptive energy in direct proportion to their arbitrariness, that dominates \"the Gothic convention\" as I have been describing it so far. \n\n\"X within and X without\" or \"X within an X\" are the guiding structures of these conventions: a story within a story, a secret held by another character and the same secret held by another, a prison from which there escape to another prison, a dream from which one wakens to find it true. \n\nFor characters within these conventions, to be active is either to impose an arbitrary barrier or to breach one, a breach that is transgressive and attended by violence at the threshold. \n\nThis is the range of Gothic conventions that is available for interpretation based on depths and the depths.
