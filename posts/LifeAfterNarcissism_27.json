Information on things like financial help, credit cards, etc. or car information, like literally anything that parents sometimes know how to do and show their kids how to do. \n\nSo like many Nabuse victims, I found myself being very emotionally dependent on my parents. But now that I'm older and theyve almost literally lost their Narc minds, I dont have a **reliable** \"dont say I never did anything for you\" source of information on these *adult* things. I just turned 27 and am just starting to really build up my personal credit, assets, etc.\n\nJust wondering if you guys had some recommendations. Even ppl on youtube or web links or even classes or something. For something like finances, I've been thinking of seeking a financial advisor at my bank or similar to help me start and build up my credit but I would love any suggestions or personal experiences. I obviously dont have these resources in my personal circle and I do look for outside resources on a regular basis but obviously any additional info would be appreciated.  :)",

        "text": "Edit: Sorry the title should say 'to' not 'do'\n\nI grew up with two abusive narc parents in an extremely controlling and strict middle eastern household. Up until the age of 20 when I escaped, I was not allowed to:\n\n- Leave the house at any time without asking or without needing some extreme justification \n- Eat without asking permission\n- Go to the store alone, or do anything alone\n\nIt's been 8 years since I left. I'm married now to someone who is the complete opposite of my parents. I know that objectively I have complete freedom and I am not judged on really basic wants and needs like 'I want to go for a walk in the park', but I have a real problem doing anything that involves leaving the house or doing something basic that would serve only me.\n\nFor example this morning I'm really struggling to go to the market. What I really want to do is get up, take a shower, go visit the market, pick up a nice fish and cook it up for lunch.\n\nThis sounds super simple to anyone that hasn't grown up with narc parents. But the first thoughts that come to my mind are -\n\n- I'm not allowed\n- There's no need to go anywhere you can just eat the food you have at home\n- You are selfish for wanting to do something for yourself\n\nLogically I know that I have no restrictions on my activities, I can do whatever I want, I live in a western country, I won't be judged for wanting something. Despite this, I can't convince myself that I'm allowed to want things, I'm allowed to go out because I'm an adult and I decide what I do. I keep thinking my husband will judge me even though I know he definitely won't.\n\nI hope someone can relate and maybe give me some tips about pushing through these ingrained thoughts. I am sick of struggling with these basic things :(",

        "text": "Over time I've noticed a theme in the ways that exploitative, emotional vampire type narcissists interact with others: they'll express all kinds of outward *emotion*, ranging from subtle cues to over-the-top explosions, without the expression being connected to or grounded in their own feelings. It's like the act of emoting is detached from any felt sense they might have of what's going on inside themselves. Their stern lecturing or woe-is-me crying or whatever other form of intense expression is propped up in front of them like a shield that they use to hide behind, to try to dispose of the knotted-up confused parts of themselves and to somehow interact with others, all at the same time. There's always a note of hungry desperation even when trying to play it cool or making it seem like they're in control. But little or no real expression of feeling. Moments of genuine, heartfelt honesty are terrifying to such people.\n\nWhen I was around 7 or 8 years old I started to see more clearly how both of my parents were constantly doing this. They had their personas - their shields - ready for almost any situation. Chatting with other adults in the neighborhood or at church? They would be in agreeable fawning mode, giving off carefully timed signals of \"I'm listening\" or \"that's interesting\", while occasionally flashing a smile or a laugh that didn't match their eyes. Getting into an (as usual) one-sided bickering session at home? My cold affectionless mother would quickly fire up her rage-and-contempt mode, unable to even recognize much less say that she was hurt or frustrated or sad, while my weak collusive father tried to hide behind his groveling pushover persona, too terrified of his own buried anger and shame to seriously consider expressing it.\n\nEventually, and secretly, I became so disgusted with both of my parents' fake maturity and psychic destructiveness - especially my mother's verbal abuse, harrowing as it was in the moments when it was happening - that I reacted by taking up the opposite \"strategy\": feeling without emoting. I learned to feel privately, to the extent that I could feel through my numbness and dissociation. Fantasies and dialogues constructed entirely in my head became the refuge where I put feelings for safekeeping. It wasn't just that outwardly expressing emotion was unsafe (although that was a big part of it too), I *refused* to become like these twisted people who could blast someone with contempt while not showing the slightest flicker of feeling behind their eyes.",

I still feel some guilt, but she is a master at minimizing everything I've done and my e/ndad does the same. So I'm kind of back to being just fine about maintaining NC but in an objective sense, the fact they will probably die with their oldest daughter feeling so disconnected from and unloved by them makes me sad.

        "text": " While he was in Italy on holiday with his mom who always a burden on our relationship, he told me he wanted to move out with me, and take the next step, I was hopeful. A week later he calls me telling me he has decided to move to Italy for good, that he wants to have a family there, and tried to convince me to go, he said he was going anyway, and that one day I will understand. I don't have the language, and am still in college, instead of supporting me through that and waiting a few years, he made the decision without me. I was extremely let down, hurt, felt betrayed to a certain degree that after 6 years, he could do this, walk away so easily. When he got back I ended up avoiding him for 2 days, saying I was busy with college stuff etc...cause I was so hurt and had no idea what to say or how to handle it. He was sending me texts saying how I don't care, what kind of love is this etc...blaming me. I ended up losing my patience, telling him the way you treated me was a joke, I am not a dog who follows someone to a country, you didn't have the decency to even discuss this with me etc...I was expressing my hurt through text because I was so angry and couldn't bring myself to see him. He ended up saying \"I am done with you\" instead of it sinking in, I went on the defense and said that was obvious the minute you made your decision. He said good luck with your small life you small person. That was hurtful, and I didn't see the reason behind such a horrible ending and hurtful ending text. That was it.\n\nFor some reason 3 months on of no contact, but I was still pining for this person to be back in my life, and was completely stuck in my life, even with counseling, it was just helping me cope by not falling into a serious depression, but still I haven't got the feeling to live my life back. This massive painful void was left in my life and nothing or nobody could take it away. I saw last month he created playlists on youtube with all these sad love songs, saying I wish she would come back around etc...one song even had my name in it. I thought wow he does have a heart, he does care. I did think maybe if I just reached out things would be okay. I decided I had enough of this, and came across blogs on forgiveness, and apologies etc...I thought maybe this would do the trick. After getting advice on here, I thought the way I handled it wasn't correct, and I should have met in person, and dealt with it properly. I end up breaking contact.\n\nI sent him a message on whatsapp:\n\"Hi this is Lauren. I know it has been a while, but I am saddened by the way things happened between us. I wanted to apologize for my part and the way I handled the situation regarding your decision with Italy. Anyway, hope you are doing well.\"\n\nHe replies \"who's this?\noh hi, thanks\"\n\nI reply \" It's Lauren, You are welcome, take care\"\n\nHe replies \" take care\"\n\nI then say this to which I got no response \" It would have been nice if you offered an apology back for your part, but I wasn't expecting one. It seems you don't care. Either way I have forgiven you, wishing you well\".\n\nThe coldness and indifference of his responses really got to me,how could the person I loved with every fiber of my being just not bother to even ask how I am, not care to see me before they move country. I can see he is online all the time, yet can't take the time to respond to last my message. I just can't get over how he is happy being strangers for the rest of our lives. The past 6 years were a lie it seems, because if he cared or loved me how could he treat me like this. I just want to take this pain away, I can't bear it. Constantly have this sick feeling in my stomach, and emotionally drained. I feel I just made it ten times worse reaching out, stupidly thinking it would help.\n\nI don't need anyone saying what a stupid mistake or something, I already feel bad enough. I would appreciate some advice, or help or something.",

        "text": "Since I was 12 or 13, I remember having this sense- and it only comes up now when I try to think about some trauma-related issues or reactions. In therapy we were talking about about how I seem to have a full on emotional mode/reaction \"child\", and an overseer, sort of adult-supervisor mode, but not just me being me and it being ok. This rings true for me if I look back and look now- as a teen I became either explosive/overwhelmingly emotional or \"wise beyond your years\". I was impulsive but restrained beasue I was watching out for myself, so I didn't become an addict but also didn't do things just because it was me, if that makes any sense. \nFrom that young age it was a sense of a hole where my self should be. If there was attention on me I would disappear literally or as in dissociation- or get fight/flight overwhelmed. There was no good, normal attention generally and if it is or was there I didn't expect or recognize it. One sign of all this for me is that I am utterly startled when I realized someone remembers me (like when I found out some people in college I knew were mad at each other because they both wanted to go out with me- and I was floored that they remembered that I existed). I think it was so fundamentally an issue that when in high school I learned some meditation techniques in a group, I felt cold emptiness instead of \"just noticing.\" \nI'm a parent now, and careful about how I look at or delve into any of this stuff, as is my therapist, and she was carefully asking me about this the other day so it has percolated up for the first time in a while. Sometimes I don't expect people to talk to me like an adult- and more generally I don't expect people to kind of see me, who I am, respect my opinion, etc. \nIs this at all relatable to any of you? If you've worked through it, what was helpful? \nWith my therapist I am working on responding to attention ON me in different ways (like if I don't like assumptions or lines of questioning to ask direct questions immediately about it, or calmly state my mind.), and workign on staying present in a conversation or interaction. I know I need to be cautious about thinking about this a lot because I do slip into dissociation if it is too stirred up all at once, but I also would love to be able to be heard and seen and to feel visible for the right things.

I have moved on, and recently even remarried to a man who is everything a husband should be...\n\n...but, the further I get from my previous marriage - and the more I see what a healthy, happy relationship is supposed to feel like - the more angry I get at my ex-husband. \n\nWhen I divorced him, I didn't have the faintest clue about narcissism. I had no idea what he was doing. I divorced him because my gut feeling finally made me leave, after years of his lying, sneaky covertly controlling behavior. But during my recovery, I learned about narcissist personalities and that he was a flaming narcissist. I now feel so stupid that I rolled over and gave him EVERYTHING in the divorce. At the time, I felt so guilty for leaving him that I gave him every shared penny we had, any household good he wanted, anything he wanted (except our dog, I wouldn't budge on that).\n\nI see now that he knew exactly what he was doing. He was a master manipulator, and took advantage of my guilty feelings. He hid money, took anything of any value, and used my deepest insecurities against me, all the while portraying himself as the victim. \n\nMy question for all of you: is it normal to get more and more angry as time goes by? I feel like I should be caring less and less. But as I heal, I have a clearer picture of the wrongs he did in our marriage, and how I used to makes excuses for his behavior, and it just makes me furious. We have absolutely no contact now, and very few shared friends left. But I just can't stop my growing anger for him. Don't get me wrong, I'm not obsessed over this, but occasionally I find myself wishing I could get back at him. I want to hurt him where it counts - in his fragile ego. :)\n\nAm I normal? Will I ever stop feeling so much animosity towards him and shame that I was so blind?",

I am NC and I do not have any dangerous roommates and I live in a decent neighborhood. There is no logical reason for a person to feel unsafe in my current living situation. My state of mind reminds me of these scene in Jessica Jones: https://media.giphy.com/media/12sy21GQVakHPq/giphy.gif\n\nI get terrible flashbacks, from moments all throughout my childhood and 20s, when I let my guard down. I think this is part of why I like to keep my apartment so messy. It's a visual and mental distraction. Without the mess, I'm one step closer to being alone with my thoughts. When I'm trying to sleep, the flashbacks get worse, so I try to make myself as absolutely tired as possible before I go to bed so I can fall asleep faster.\n\nI just want to feel safe in my own home. Even though I'm safe now, I was not for 3 decades of my life. Even when I wasn't living with my Nparents, I was stuck in a cycle of depending on horrible people, and living with them, and I was re-abused often. 20 months of NC cannot make up for that much abuse.\n\nI guess I don't know what I can do to make myself feel safe at home. I don't find redecorating to be helpful, which I know is common advice to make a space feel \"your own\". I feel one step closer in that I feel like I've correctly identified the problem, so I think that's good. I'm just not sure how to move forward now that I've recognized this.

In the post, I had mentioned that Nmom was getting a biopsy done and she has had a pattern before about making her health seem way worse than it was.\n\nMy little brother called me yesterday with those results. She has cancer that has spread from an unknown source to her lungs, kidney, and liver. Prognosis does not sound good and she is starting chemo very soon. Nmom lives with our favorite uncle and he is trying to push my brother to take care of her. He lives two hours from her and is in no position to care for her. \n\nShe decided to give him the news on his birthday, after she returned the mother's day card he got her. He seems like he is taking it well, but at the same time, I can tell it pains him. We talked about how the mother we remember growing up died a long time ago and we both feel emotionally numb to the situation. \n\nI have been no contact with her for over a year, and brother has been very low contact for about the same length of time. I'm struggling with the no contact over this situation. I know her being sick is not going to fix or change her abusive nature, but at the same time thinking about her dying without speaking to her or seeing her again hurts more than I thought it could. My natural instinct is to want to care for her, but I think I am thinking of the mother from my childhood before she became unable to handle her mental problems. \n\nWhen I went no contact, I struggled immensely at first and it wasn't until I met with my pastor that I felt more at peace with the situation. She had said that at that point a year and a half ago I was mourning the loss of my mother as I remembered her before she became the mentally ill shell of a woman that she used to be. My brother and I think she was probably this way when we were little too, but she kept us so sheltered, we wouldn't have known any different. \n\nAt this point, I am not making any concrete plans to contact or see Nmom. I may change my mind if I am told that she is terminal with X months left to live, but I will just have to see what ends up happening.\n\ntl;dr Nmom has cancer in lungs, kidney, and liver and I feel guilty that I have been no contact for over a year.

Today I was considering the cycle of abuse: Calm &gt; Tensions Building &gt; Incident &gt; Reconciliation &gt; Repeat from Calm. It's well understood that this is basically addictive via trauma bonding. It is obviously analogous to Idealize, Devalue, Discard, Repeat. \n\nWhen your N discards you, within the cycle of abuse you had an Incident. Your mind is so used to going then into Reconciliation and Calm, the good times that you lived for in the madness, that it longs for that acute sense of closure. You're like an addict who isn't getting the next hit even though your body expects it. That's why you want them back and also why you feel no closure, you're left lingering at the lowest point in the cycle and you crave the high that followed.\n\nBreaking the addiction is hard.",

        "text": "TLDR: Identity crisis: feeling like a fraud in my successful, professional, safe life vs feeling unsafe, but at home in my chaotic, problematic, similar to childhood life. \n\nBackstory: \nI grew up a single (female) child alone with my insane, paranoid, violent, emotionally incestious Nmom, seriously isolated very far away from anyone. As a child I identified with Nmom and so I subconsciously assumed I'd never work to support my life, since she didn't: spineless Edad worked far away and enabled this leaching, shitpoor existence we had. I was beaten/yelled at if I threw away/didn't appreciate food, clothes, stuff, etc, and my parents are both adept at obtaining stuff and money through scheming, manipulating, lying or stealing - although they'll rationalise how it is actually just right that they don't pay bills/don't repay \"loans\", just take \"a couple expensive tools from work, no one will notice\", etc. \n\nThe nice part of my childhood was all the time I spent in nature, or with animals, books, writing, drawing etc. I had no people around, but lots of beautiful nature, where I'd run/ski/bike/hike usually alone or with my dog. We rarely visited anyone outside and I didn't have many friends. This was the first ten years of my life, and so I was seriously inapt at social interaction (which Nmom found hilarious, proof of my specialness, and thus encouraged), and preferred to be alone with my books or my thoughts. I did very well in school, and was thus allowed to be a weirdo loner. Later I've learned social interaction, speaking in groups, social norms etc, but it's still like a \"second language\" in a way. I'm much more \"native\" with the crazy enmeshed interaction I was used to with Nmom, or none at all - although I try hard now to avoid such interactions, to keep healthy boundaries and to keep a healthy amount of friends around.  \n\nAbout 7 years ago (19y), after an exceptionally crazy family period, I had some sort of rock bottom moment, put on my big girl pants, locked down all my bitterness and anger (healthy, yeah), moved out of their grasp(despite Nmoms efforts to keep me), worked hard, finished high school (with top grades), got a bachelor+master degree, stopped making social drama, started yoga, mindfullness, traveling, cooking, weight lifting, ditched my unhealthy friends, got new healthier ones, and did some sort of a class-shift away from that leeching, scheming family, towards \"I'm a proud contributing member of society with an internal moral compass\". Yay me. \n\nI always did have a bunch of depressed episodes, suicidal episodes, anxiety, etc, but I thought this was normal, and usually locked myself into my room and cried it out or went to lift some heavy weights and just powered through it. I've partially dissociated from a lot of these moments, and eventually didn't have proper access to neither childhood memories nor depressive episodes. It's like I forgot this all happened to me, and just remember the rest of my life. \n\nNow I'm 27, fit, a PhD student (which means a steady income in my country), and lots of career options. However, I feel like a huge fraud, and like I'm denying my inner child the life she wants. \n\nOver the last year I had a mental breakdown, when the walls around my violent/abusive memories suddenly went down, with flashbacks, nightmares and suicidal ..urges. I was diagnosed with PTSD (CPTSD), spent several months out of work in some friends' guest room, slowly getting back to current reality, and exploring the newly available memories. I went NC on parents, started trauma therapy (as opposed to low-key, student-support therapy I've had for years), have read a bunch of relevant books, journal every day, and I'm easing back into work. \n\nHowever. I don't feel like this is real. I fear someone taking my money, my job, salary, degree and everything away from me, going \"no, this is not for people like you!\", \"you'd never have gotten this if we knew how you were!\". I fear my friends realising how I \"really am\" and rejecting me forever. I fear my Nmom \"exposing me\" to work, friends, potential boyfriends, and either telling them what I'm really like, or having people realise I'm like her, and thus excluding me from society/social support/law protection, etc. I'm honestly scared that if someone tries to kill me the police is not going to help because they realise I'm \"that sort of person\". This is a reoccurring nightmare for me. \n\nMy friends, ex, etc, tell me I'm an amazing person, that no one can take these things away from me, that I'm not in any way like crazy Nmom, but of course: that's just because I've fooled them too and they have yet to realise.. \n\nI'm happier in a sense when I'm dealing with messy homes, chaotic life situations and no city life / pretty expensive things. It feels like a fear of success in a way, and it feels unhealthy to me (and similar to Nmom who needs someone to need her/problems to solve), but I'm trapped between this urge to live a chaotic life free of commitments, and finally, finally reaching this stable, safe, beautiful life where I can BE one of those people wearing silk blouses and having a beautiful home devoid of cheap, shitty, broken things and screaming Ns. \n\nI don't know where to go from this. The latter seems to me a sort of escape fantasy, something I've idealised since childhood: \"if my family was rich and pretty and wore nice clothes, then my mother would not beat me/someone would help me when I got beaten\". It is also something I'd take pride in achieving, and makes me feel very safe. \nThe first - slightly chaotic, free life - is where I feel more relaxed, more myself, but also where I'm constantly afraid: \"if something bad happened now, no one would save me\", \"Am I turning into Nmom now?\". \n\nIs it useful to keep doing the \"pretty, successful\" things and work on becoming confident in that, or to try and let go of the fear and have a chaotic life? \n\nI welcome any of you marvellous fighters' thoughts, personal histories, anything. \n\nI tried to keep this short (imaging the long version.. :)), but I'll fill in any missing/relevant details if requested.",

Despite the years of abuse (sifting through my memories,  I can't really find evidence of narcissistic-style abuse before I was about 8 years old, and I'm pretty sure it ramped up when I was about 10-11), I have graduated from a great college, worked, made friends, got married, have kids, am getting a graduate degree.....I'm doing better than many people do without having to deal with the fallout of emotional abuse.\n\nI have my own life now.  I have been NC with nmom for more than 5 years.  I'm in my 30s, nmom kicked me out of the house 3 weeks after I turned 18.  1 week after I graduated high school.  3 months before I was due to start college 400 miles away.   I have been an adult for a long time. Because I was forced into it before I was ready.  I've made my peace with that.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nAnd yet I'm bitter.  For the years she stole from me.  I spent so much time trying to figure out what was *real* and what was *normal*.  I spent so much time being a shit and displaying narcissistic tendencies and I still feel bad about the effect I had on the people around me.\n\nI could have been building a more solid foundation of friendship and scholarship instead of needing to question every single interaction I had with another person.\n\nI could have figured out what direction I wanted to take my life in if I wasn't busy trying to please people who could not be pleased.  Or if they didn't shit all over my interests.  I only figured out like 2 years ago why I thought that working with food was not considered a worthwhile pursuit--so thanks, dad, for putting THAT in my head.\n\n...Years later, I'm finally free of nearly all of my parents influences and I'm still bitter.  \n\nI could have spent so much more time being happy.  Being well-adjusted. \n\nI'm finally applying for PhD programs this fall.  The low grades I earned while I was in college--and just beginning to figure out that my beloved mother was abusive--are going to haunt me during the application process, a decade later.\n\nYears later, and she is still hurting me.  The effects of her actions are still hurting me in measureable ways. \n\nMy parents, and especially nmom stole years of time from me.  Years that I spent healing from hurts that I shouldn't have had to deal with.\n\n\nAnd I'm still.  so.  bitter.\n\n\n\n",

I never get the true final say, although he tries to make it seem like decisions are mine. \n\nI'm looking forward to making my own schedule without someone else's emotions or wishes in mind. I'm getting sick of his midday naps and late nights. He also gets bored very easily so reading a book is too tedious. It's hard to get him to stay quiet long enough for me to read. Video games have been working lately so that's nice. \n\nMy exit day is coming up soon. The more I read the easier it is. I'm really getting sick of his manipulation though. Yesterday we went to dinner with my aunt and he lied a bunch about random things. He made annoyed faces at me throughout the night. It didn't even make sense. As soon as we left (which was in a hurry since he was impatient) he complained about the service, food, setting, everything. Guess he will never go back there. Whatever. \n\nSometimes I doubt if he's a narcissist and then he goes and behaves like that. These past few days before the start of his new job have sucked. I thought he would have been nicer considering he expects me to be his maid. There are random moments when he talks about what he will buy me. No genuine connection. \n\nA relationship with an actual connection will be nice. This fake 40's housewife stuff has got to go. I'm not in an arrangement. I'm sick of pretending it's all ok. (Dinner with his superNARC parents tonight. At least I know what I'm dealing with scary as it can be. Learning about all this stuff recently - narcissism, emotional abuse stages, gaslighting). ",

I was credited with organising it.\n\nEx's group found out, probably through public facebook pages, because all of a sudden, they copied us and arranged to ATTEND my self defence class in the evening (not a private session, joining in with us). I didn't go to this for obvious reasons!\n\nThe next session, my Ex's nasty brother turned up. He has joined the group, been added to our WhatsApp/facebook chat groups. \n\nI'm so upset. I had him blocked everywhere before this!\nThis guy is only going cos he loves violence, is always posing with guns and stuff and thinks he's a big hard man. \nHe constantly attention seeks in the class (pretending to fall over etc) Its really horrible with this vile, lying bully there and he is liked by all my new friends :-( \n\nI understand, cos on the outside he and my ex are both really charming angels. \n\nI cant say this to the others cos they'll think Im a spoilt brat, but I feel my territory has been completely invaded. \nThis was the only thing I've loved doing for a long, long time and I made new friends at last, and now I cant bring myself to go. \n\nBackground:\nEx had spent most of the past year blanking me/cancelling any activities that are meant to take place between our clubs (sports matches etc) \nI thought things were getting odd when he suddenly started organising stuff with my new group again. He changed a football match (which I hate) to hockey the day before (but I might be paranoid on that one!)\nHe followed me around a party which all the clubs in the area attend. He would make a point of staring at me: he moved to stand in my eye line, and walked back and forth past me over and over, glaring at me the whole time. \nOther people noticed this too, so I felt not so paranoid this time! :-/ \n\nHe and flying monkeys also followed me in a car park, yelling \"there she is, (Narc-Ex's Name)!\" \n\nThey're a nightmare. Narc Ex just seems happy to watch me and follow, so I cant say they are doing any harm. \nI told a few people, but it happens in a public place and anyone can join a gym class, so nothing can be done.\n\nAnyone know how a stressed out person should deal with this? All the bad memories are coming back. \nThank you x \n",

I have 2 boys 15mo and a 7 year from a previous relationship. My daughter got wrapped up in her cord and unfortunately met her demise. The day we found out he smashed the house up and came at me with clenched fists in a fit of rage. I managed to get my boys and myself locked into the bathroom and called the police and called it quits. 2 days later I went to deliver my daughter.  \nI'm traumatised, but I've been coping and life is really good. I have a great new boyfriend who is just a diamond and the last couple of months have been particularly good.  \nI tried to facilitate contact between my youngest and his dad at my house, then at cafes, at contact centres, but he kept changing his mind about his involvement, was harrasing me via phone calls and messages and unwilling to meet me on any compromise and only wanted to meet at my house which was against police, social workers and domestic violence organisations advice.  \nSo I stopped contact and got a solicitor, took him to court for a live with order (custody) this week and got it, but my other intention was to get a contact order so my son could safely see his dad. (He has multiple disabilities)\nBut the magistrates didn't read the social workers report or ignored it which stated ex needed an assesment to see his capability to parent, that contact shouldn't happen until he had been assessed. The magistrates said to me \"Court is a last resort so DO TRY to sort it out between yourselves.\" I've never felt more belittled, even by him.  \nHe lied to social workers about me..said he only smashed the house up because I was goading him about his 'dead' dad. He turned up to court wih his dad. All sorts of lies.  \nMagistrates directed us back to mediation and I just feel sick about it. Ex isn't the sharpest tool in the box but he is unreasonable, entitled, angry, violent, and thinks EVERYBODY is conspiring against him. Mediation is impossible. The thought of having to look at him and talk through everything makes me feel sick as he is so impossibly difficult.\nI thought going to court would make it better and so many people have my back and believe me but it felt like the magistrates thought I was some silly petty woman and didn't take our concerns seriously. I feel worse now and had my first panic attack this morning in 9 months and yet again I'm having to build myself up after feeling like a total idiot for getting with him in the first place. It's dragged everything all up again, and it sucks :(\n",

I've enrolled in community college and am both scared and excited to start this fall. I've been told I'm stupid my entire life, so I doubt myself and have those voices in my head telling me I'll fail, but I'm trying to push past it. Right now I'm thinking of all those things I haven't been allowed to do. I've signed up for tennis lessons, I took my first english horseback riding lesson last night, I've signed up for a live model painting party in a couple weeks. I'm just pretty excited about finding out where my talents lie and who I really am. It's still rough going, since I can't file for divorce for 5 more months, and he's still being unkind and pulling the same manipulative actions, but I've set boundaries, and today is a good day. ",

One time to the point I had to get 10 stitches in my face.  She also is what I call a bottom feeder.  She is on social security, my grandpa bought her a house, and yet she is still always trying to get money off of people.  Especially me.  I am kind of successful, have a bachelor's degree and work as a legal assistant.  I will be starting law school either this year or 2018, since I just finished my bachelor's I am strongly thinking of taking a year off to relax.\n\nIt is coming up on my year anniversary that I moved on my own.  During the past 6-8 months I have limited my contact with her.  After an exchange we had yesterday I am going no contact.  At this point, I never want to see her ugly face or listen to her BS again.  \n\nAs a child, my N-mom and alcoholic dad (who passed away when I was 17) kept me away from most of my family.  I have a large family and do not know probably 85% of them, and only let me around immediate (1st cousins, aunts,  etc.) very limited.  It is sad really because most of my family are good and supportive people from observation.  \n\nAnyway, the reason I am making this post is because I kind of feel like I have no one... and that's the reason that I do keep having contact with this awful woman.  I have a supportive boyfriend that I can talk to about a lot of things.  But still when I feel like I have no family support it causes me emotional pain.  What do you guys do to stay positive?  How do you not get lonely and go back to N's for validation or approval?  ",

Playing games with him online revealed he was racist, homophobic, and used mental handicaps as insults at every opportunity. Hanging out with him IRL showed a severe lack of respect, waking up my neighbour's at 3am blaring his car stereo right before going home, throwing his garbage on my floor etc. I called him out on his shit and he sent some vile childish things and we haven't talked since.\n\nGrowing up, my parents were overbearing, gave my sister freedoms that I never had, treated me as if I was guilty until proven innocent, never had my back, even stalked me online when I smoked weed for the first time and wrote some really stupid philosophical notes (wish I did more reading back then, like I do now, instead of thinking I was the shit lol). My mother tried to argue that I was schizophrenic when I acted strangely due to concussion induced psychosis, and years before that ambushed and attacked me during our first and final attempt at family counselling. It was sad not being able to do things with my friends, and really stunted my social life.\n\nMy uncle's only contact me if they need something, i.e. computer or phone problems. My cousins, except for one I've always been close to and I hold dear like a second sister (my sister's not perfect but pretty cool), don't even respond when I send them messages. I'm not going to the k them for birthday cards anymore if they can't be bothered to say you're welcome or have a conversation about anything with me.\n\nI just hope I sort out my life enough so that I get a decent job and can fully support myself financially, because I suck at a lot of important things in life.",

How blessed he was to have found the woman of his dreams. This is a man who repeatedly called me the love of his life, wanted to marry me someday.

My sister seems to think he posted that photo and the caption because he knew that I'd look at his instagram and it would hurt me (like I said he never posts about women he dates).",

I don't really know how they will react to this. My parents say they are religious but they really are not. They might be more mad about the religious wedding and not the legal wedding.In short, a religious wedding (which is technically a lie because we won't even be doing that but that is what we will tell them) allows a couple to live together without the need of a legal wedding in my faith. \n\nI really don't know what to do now. My father enters my dreams  almost every other night. I am scared as hell. I don't even know if they will agree to meeting me at starbucks or anything else. My dad might see him and I together then walk out. \n\nMy boyfriend says that he won't do anything but my father has a crazy temper and he is pretty manipulative.\n\nAny advice will do especially if anyone was raised in a conservative Balkan/Middle Eastern Family.",

        "text": "First, apologies if this is in the wrong sub. First time poster to any of the RBN subs.\n\nIt all started with a DNA test. From my birthday (35M) my wife got me a 23andMe ancestry DNA kit. I submitted my sample and was awaiting the result when my dad called and I told him all about it. He was very interested in hear the results when I got them. He never really knew his father, but by all accounts he was a world-class N, like he was trying to make it the N HoF. One of the very few things that my dad thought he knew about his father was that he was part Native American. My dad even remembered his dad showing him pictures of our ancestors in full on Native American garb. He wouldn't shut up about it apparently. \n\nWhile waiting for the results. My great-aunt passed away. This woman actually raised my dad for a number years when he was very young. This hit him harder than he expected and at the memorial service I realized that he's getting older and a lot of the older generation in my family are very few now. I didn't know what I could do, but I wanted to help my dad in some way.\n\nI get the results, and I might be the whitest person the planet. There is nothing close to Native American in my DNA. For those interested, they show just about everything imaginable and if something is greater than 1/10 or 1% it shows. So if there was any Native American it was less than that. And my dad could only have a maximum of twice as much as I do, so he has nothing either. I shared my results with a few family members I thought would find it interesting, including my dad. His response, \"well I guess that's just something else he told me that wasn't true.\" I can't lie, I was sad that I found that out and killed one of the few things he had from his own father. \n\nThis got me curious. My grandfather was as rolling stone as they say, and never in the picture. I tracked him down more than a decade ago, but he wasn't interested in connecting it seemed. But where is he now? Is he still alive? I wanted to know. I found him again, but turned out he died a few years ago. I call my dad to tell him the news. He assumed he was already dead, but I think it was still something he needed process.\n\nBut wait...there's more!\n\nWe knew the my Grandfather was married before he married my Grandmother, and that he had kids with his first wife. Didn't really have much more info than that. I decided that I was going to find his lost siblings. Good or bad I didn't want my dad to get to the end of his life and regret now finding them. Remember this all happened more than 50 years ago. I put on my Encyclopedia Brown hat and got to sleuthing. I made a list of rules for myself to follow, included my list of assumptions, and started digging. I didn't tell me dad, I didn't want to get his hopes up and I wanted to be absolutely sure that if I found them that they wanted to have contact before letting him know.\n\nI found his brother! I found two possible email addresses. I wrote up a email to send to him. Erased it. Wrote another one, and sent it to both emails. One bounced back immediately, not a valid email address. I got a response the second one about 10 minutes after sending it. It was him, confirmed. \n\nI called my dad yet again. I blurted out that I found his brother. I don't think he knew what to say. He was shocked. I played coordinator. They talked last night. It don't know if it could have gone better. They talked about their shitty experiences with their father, they talked about themselves. My dad told him he had no expectations about a relationship, my new uncle responded, \"No man, we're going to do this, we're going to be brothers.\" Turns out there were 4 siblings, two have passed away to cancer, but my dad also has a sister out there. \n\nTL:DR - I took a dna test, learned that my NGrandfather had lied about our ancestry. Decided to track him down, found out he died, but that that my dad had a brother out there.\n\nWe might carry the scars of for generations, but even decades later we can make new families from broken ones, and even find some healing.",

I've spent many many years actually most of my life drowning out my emotions trying to fill that empty hole inside of me with so many different things like relationships, friendships, drugs, restricted eating etc. and they have ALL blown up in my face. Really since the last couple of months that I've given up all of those substitutions I have felt my emotions a whole range of them fully and instead of shutting it down like I would before I sit with it and I feel it is actuallly the only thing that might be a solution to healing. Anyways back to the forgiveness - forgiveness is not something you're doing for them, this is something you are doing for yourself, in fact you dont even have to tell them you forgive them or maintain any type of relationship. Forgiveness is just understanding with compassion that these are people who are perpetually miserable every single second of their life, there is no hope for them they will die alone, bitter and miserable and unfortunately that is what they want. In order to not become that person we have to all forgive them and I'm absolutely certain it will take a long time and will have its ups and downs but forgiveness I think is ultimately the only way to become strong, positive, happy, compassionate, and kind people. Would love to hear your guys' thoughts on this",

        "text": "It's a fact that biologically our brains perceive uncertainty equivalent to fear. The reason we exist as humans is because we have evolved with a healthy fear response. It is an important ingredient to any species that remains today. i.e. 'run away from the lion,' LOL. \n\n-\n\n\nOur brains are wired to 'survive,' not necessarily be in a happy relationship. Our subconscious  cannot discern fear from the uncertainty of divorce from 'Oh My God a Bear is stalking me'. \n\n-\n\n\nIn fact, the reason our blood pressure shoots up when we are scared is because our bodies are programmed to concentrate our blood into our core in case a limb is ripped off. \n\n-\n\nMy point is that in great emotional distress and uncertainty our minds play tricks on us. That doesn't make the pain any easier or any less real. Heck No, Just don't let it make bad decisions on your behalf.\n\n\n-\n\nYou probably have great nostalgia and sometime forget the bad times when you were married. I have. You often may feel pessimistic about the future, but I wonder if at least some of this is a case of 'the tail wagging the dog,' or in this case 'hard wired protection instinct wagging the modern human.'\n\n\n-\n\n\nIf we can recognize that change and uncertainty are basic principles that affect us on a biochemical level as well as an emotional one we can greet the future and the transformation we are undergoing with the understanding that we do not know enough to be pessimistic. Maybe some of our pessimism isn't rooted in our soul, but in our bodies!\n\n\n-\n\n\nFear of our future after divorce keeps us stuck in the pain of the past. This fear prompts our mind chatter to paint a bleak picture of an uncertain future, which in turn creates a disempowering and negative attitude towards life. A negative attitude on life becomes all pervasive and leaves us powerless and depressed. If we stop and think about it, the future is totally unpredictable and unknowable. We simply cannot know what the future holds; therefore, pessimism is illusory even absurd. \n\n\n-\n\n\nMaybe pessimism is the result of a hard-wired hyper-vigilant biology reacting to fear by holding us back to limit risk taking in much the same way fear affects blood pressure in my previous example. However, risk taking is essential to a happy life and starting over with new relationships and a new dynamic with old relationships. Thus it is our perspective about the future that will lay the foundation for what is coming around the bend.\n\n\n-\n\nr/divorcedonts",

I feel really embarrassed and I get overwhelmed and cry when talking about him. \n\nNot all of them know yet that we have broken up, and as each of them find out they are seriously shocked because they think that we were madly in love and living a good life together. When I first got together with my Nex he had been in a very bad place in his life and I helped him back onto his feet. All his family and friends loved me and saw my value in his life. Each one of them has expressed that they are surprised and sorry to see us break up, I was good for him, they hope we get back together (now I feel like a Narc writing about myself like I'm amazing! lol). \n\nHe cheated last summer and after that had a major personality change (the nice guy mask came off) spent the next year manipulating, lying and completely messing with my head. \n\nHow do you explain that to your friends? As in, one or two of them have asked if we would remain friends with each other or if I would be upset if they still talk with him. What do I share about the breakup? \n\nObviously I do not want to put any of them in a difficult position or force them to take sides. On the other hand, it makes me so angry that he can quietly get away with being an abuser and none of these good people know what he is really like. But then, he also deserves to have friends and people who might actually be a good influence for him, I don't want to destroy his relationships with people who care about him. \n\nTwo of them know. One a close friend of mine who I and spoke with a few weeks after the breakup. She immediately cut him off. The other one is the friend who introduced us. I spoke to her because of all of the group she is the one who I felt should know the full truth. I knew she would be most shocked and not understand what had happened, I wanted to be honest with her. She has been a good support and lets me vent to her when I need to every now and again. She keeps a distance from him now, he hasn't reached out to her at all. I have asked both of them to not pass on any information about me to him. \n\nThe rest, I don't know what to say. Things just didn't work out? He didn't treat me well?

It seems crazy but I fell out with this narcissist nearly ten years ago but I still struggle with ruminating over it and feel like I've never quite managed to move on. To summarise I thought this person was a good friend but I had to go no contact after they got me into serious financial and emotional difficulty through generally just being untrustworthy, entitled and selfish. It became apparent that I was never going to get any apology or any closure so walking away was all I could do.\n\n The issue is I feel that I had to also cut out a lot of people I considered to be good friends just to keep well away from this person. The issue is I've never really recovered or been able to make any new friendships since. It is hard seeing this narcissistic abuser still hanging out with all my old friends (she is one of those people who seems to have numerous different friendship groups that she can just rotate according to her mood). I know it's all fakery but it's so hard sometimes when all I would really like is a couple of close friends. I can't seem to connect with anyone any more and really struggle with social anxiety. I feel like it's destroying my ability to function and move forward with anything!\n\nI hate how these abusers can just walk into people's lives and devastate them but be able to walk away happily without a second thought to how their behaviour is so damaging! It upsets me how no one else can see how toxic these people are.",

        "text": "It's been 2 years post narc 'relationship' and I'm almost out of my shell now, I can feel myself on the precipice of really opening up to others and being comfortable being myself and not caring what they think, more importantly, not being suspicious of every little gesture or word someone says.\n\nI still am, tho now this awareness of others actions is at a helpful level where I'm more cognizant of things people say without saying. \n\nToday I was walking w a guy I got to know over the semester, he's keen on me for whatever reason, and has been reminding me of work and things about class (I haven't been completely present the last few weeks of class because I kinda relapsed and got stuck in a rut after braking no contact and looking at N's online stuff). Anyway, we were walking out of the exam hall and he went to drop off a parcel, by all means we should've continued our walk home (everyone lives in the same vicinity) but I just bolted, i said ok, and then I just walked off, gave him a sort off 'sorry I gotta go' look which he really didn't deserve, but I couldn't control myself :(\n\nIt just felt like this moment of closeness to another person was too much, it was overwhelming and I was afraid he'd ask me out or ask for my number (we talk thru fb messenger) and I didn't want to be in that situation!! I just didn't wanna have to say oh I have a Boyfriend, or I'm not interested etc. Like, I know he's keen, but other than say 5 minutes before/after classes and the occasional message he sends (mainly about class) to try and make conversation w me (which I don't continue past 10 mins) we don't 'talk'.\n\nI'm seeing someone now, he's great and I feel really safe w him, having gone to same high school previously. I thought about why I bolted out of this 'situation' of being in close quarters w another person (as in walking from campus in the daylight, so, not exactly dangerous) and at first I told myself I didn't want to be in a situation to 'cheat', but really, when I really dug deep, I realise it was because I was afraid of getting to know another person past 'oh yea that class sucks' etc. Having to walk and chat w someone for 10-15 mins just felt like shit I didn't want to deal w :( even tho I know I could, I'm capable of holding a conversation and protecting my boundaries but why am I still so scared, it was just a lizard brain fight or flight reaction i think. Where the post narc period was dotted w guys trying to prey on me in my period of insecurity/utter weakness, and I realise I'm projecting this onto All guys T_T that people who want to get to know me are trying to hurt me. This is tough, I tell myself they can't hurt me if I don't let them, and I know where my boundaries are but deep deep down, there's always this fear that, yet again has taken over and spurred my to turn on my heels and walk the other way the moment someone expresses any sort of interest. I'm just so put off from anyone interested in me that the moment I know they are, my reaction would be to cut all contact. This is so isolating.. ",

I don't recall the context, but I  was dumbfounded when she said the words \"you remember how lenient mom is.\"\nMy immediate response was no, I don't. And she was stunned by my reply. \nI was punished just about every time I dated my boyfriend. When I suddenly moved out of the house, my sister's boyfriend moved in. I was punished for spending 3 days in my room writing a story for leisure (outlet from NDad) yet my sister isolated herself all the time. \nMy sister does not see that we were treated so differently.

        "text": "I relapsed today.  I found myself surrounded by anger and I thought I'd join the party.  Just a sip.  It couldn't be that bad.  I've been so good.  I kept calm for months.  I've kept myself occupied with things that were constructive.  I've been good.  I deserve this.  It'll be fine.  Just a little sip.  Some anger is good for me, right?\n\nNo, it's not.  I ragged.  I screamed.  I hit.  It felt so good.  Oh my god it was amazing.  To feel that rush, that wave of anger washing over me like the first sprinkles of a warm rain.  I feel like I'm home when I'm wrapped up in my anger like a hand made quilt.  I never have to feel lonely when my friend anger is with me.  I never have to feel sad or worthless when anger will defend me.  I could probably grow old with anger, if it was real.\n\nBut it's not real.  It's nothing but a defense mechanism built from tragic times that aren't welcome in my life anymore.  But how do I separate those times, that anger, from this version of myself?  How do I be me, but without what I made myself into?\n\nThis right here is the worst part of child abuse.  It's the pain that keeps on hurting.  I want it to go away.  I want it to take my anger with it.  But it won't.  It won't go away.  It stays here, trapped with me in my mind, waiting for another moment to feed on me.  My abusers took from me all that I had to give.  But now, now I keep feeding myself to anger because I don't know anything else.  \n\nIt will happily take anything I can give it.  My wife, my kids, my identity, anything at all.  But what's worse, is sometimes, I want to give it those things.  Is lonelyness the same as peacefulness?  Can I feed enough to my anger to achieve peace?  I know I can't.  But it would feel so good at first.  What comes after though...  That is the truely horrible part of child abuse.  Loneliness is what I hate the most.  Not anger, or fear, or even regret.  It's the loneliness.  \n\n\nThanks in advance for reading my vent.  My wife is an amazing person and she held me together tonight, once again.  I'll be ok, but I like to put my feelings​ down some times.  It helps me work through them.  I thought I'd try sharing for once.  Maybe others are feeling the same way and could use a connection to feel a little less lonely.\n\nIf that resonates with you, you're not alone.  \n",

        "text": "I got involved with a man who turned out to be narcissistic. There were red flags from the beginning but I ignored them, partly because I've been a bit lonely (I'm single now for pretty much the first time in my adult life), but also because he seemed really great in a lot of ways. He got annoyed because I didn't want to get straight into a relationship and since then I've been on receiving end of silent treatment, guilt trips, passive aggression, gaslighting, triangulation, you name it. It went on too long as I've been holding out hope that if I'm kind and understanding he might see what he's doing but that hasn't worked. We have mutual friends and most of them know nothing about any of this so it's been going under the radar which is quite isolating. I've told one friend who can now see it happening, which has been good for my sanity at least. But I think I will need to stay away from things he'll be at which is going to affect my social life quite badly.  \n  \nI'm annoyed at myself for getting into this situation (really I saw enough signs that I shouldn't have got close to him). BUT I'm still proud of myself for not ending up with him. I've been in relationships with two very similar men in the past and while I've got burnt, this means I've gained enough respect for myself to be able to detach instead of chasing for his approval.",

        "text": "This feels like something pretty trivial to post about, but I was looking for advice and figured, hey no one will understand this situation in its entirety better than the good folk of Life After Narcissism.\n\nI'm needing to decide whether or not to attend the out of state wedding of my cousin within my Nmom's family. Cousin is super sweet, we were close in age growing up, have not really remained close into adulthood, but I think her and her family are way nicer than any of the other people on that side of my family tree. I was planning to attend with a date as a buffer, but upon receiving the actual invitation (and not a +1), I'll now have to fly solo in order to attend. \n\nI would CERTAINLY be sat at a table with Nmom, with whom I am NC (except the times she's manipulated being in the same room as me, in which case i always make an excuse and leave) as well as Ngrandma and my brother and his GF who are not narcs but are no help. (GF is new and bro is trying to pretend that our family isn't totally fucked.) Basically, walking into the lion's den with no friend. \n\nWon't go all into it, but it's been a stressful last year or two for me and I've had to take a ton of time off work to help my father cope with a chronic illness. I kind of don't feel like taking vacation time to spend money to travel across several states to feel awkward and get narc-attacked. But this is the first big family event since I've gone NC and feel a little guilty for missing a sweet cousin's big day.\n\nWhat do you guys do in these situations? If I choose not to attend, how do I go about declining without causing a ton of drama? And if I go, how the hell do I survive that?",

My friend says no, but that would mean that there's six years of lies.  I feel so horrified at the thought of this being true, of being someone's \"supply.\"  Also, he's always been the one pushing to get married.  \n  \nHave any of you here been seriously ill?  I have.   [this article](http://thenarcissistinyourlife.com/narcissistic-spouses-discard-you-when-you-need-them-the-most/) sums up exactly what happened between us, why I left the first time.  He was disgusted with me taking medications, didn't like my doctors, called me a drug addict and lazy, and then he bailed on me days before my surgery, forcing me to move cross country and not have anyone there who would authorize my medical wishes in case of emergency.  \n  \nHe has done so many terrible things, and yet, I feel so shocked that I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around the possibility of this even being real.  What did everyone else do here when they found out?  Is it really true that he can never be cured?  \n  \nI don't know what the next step is, I'm just feeling so confused, shocked, and violated.  I called a therapist and I have an intake this Friday, and hopefully they said only 2 weeks until I'm seen.  But I feel so vulnerable right now and unsure of anything, including myself.",

He hasn't been diagnosed, but my friend (35f) told me about her previous relationship with a narcopath and advised me to look into it after all the things I'd been telling her.  \n  \nI feel like every single thing I read turned my stomach.  Fast beginnings:  my bf proposed to m e the day he met me, and I moved in about a week later.  After our time apart, I went back and within a couple weeks, we were again talking about getting married.  This time, though, it just seemed real again.  \n  \nThen, once I flew back home (we live in separate states, but I can fly anytime I want), he started hanging out with people that he supposedly hasn't seen in years, or wouldn't tell me who he was hanging out with \"you don't know them, what does it matter?\", or with people I know who didn't like me because last time he had so many bad things about me to them.  I know most of his friends think I'm a terrible person because of all the things he used to and likely again says about me.  In all reality though, last time, I had a serious disease in my spinal cord and needed him to love and support me, and I felt a distinct lack of love or understanding, and was left feeling like I had to fend for myself and walk on eggshells around him.  \n  \nNow, I barely get more than a couple words a day from him.  We used to FaceTime a few times a week and message each other a lot.  Now it's nothing.  I tried telling him that he's been distant, but he tells me it's because I'm negative and he has nothing to say to me if I'm going to be like this.  This has been going on for two months, ever since he got on chantix.  But this isn't the first time.  \n  \nI feel so emotionally drained, depressed, anxious, tired, sore, worried, and feel like I'm always on eggshells.  Everything that I've read has suggested that this is all standard narcissistic/narcopath behavior.  But I still feel like I'm to blame and that I'm overreacting.  How do you all cope?  Where do I even begin to start healing myself again?  ",

What's going on? never experienced this before, and I think ive finally come to accept that she really is this sick twisted cruel monster and its not just 'bad' moments. Is this part of the 'healing'/coming to terms process?",
