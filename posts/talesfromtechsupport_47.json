        "text": "I work in a university department with limited office space, so PhD students are given a laptop and a few rooms of hot-desks to fight over. We are aware that some users prefer Windows and some prefer macOS, so to that effect they have a choice of an Apple MacBook Pro or an HP EliteBook, both of which are very nice bang-up-to-date and expensive machines. I’ve gone off of them in recent years, but I used to be an Apple fanboy and can still appreciate the MacBook’s new super-low-profile keyboard with that fantastic “snap” to it, and the trackpad is still way ahead of any Windows offerings, although we do have to chuck in a USB-C to USB-A adapter due to the lack of ports. It’s a lovely machine to work on, and I can still just about understand Apple zealotry. One of our MacBooks is awaiting a warranty repair and the student has chosen to use university lab iMacs (for a month and counting!) rather than use an HP EliteBook in the meantime.\n\nI was somewhat surprised to receive this email from another one of our students:\n\n&gt; Hi IT man,\n&gt;  \n&gt; About a month ago I got my loaned laptop, which is the newest Mac Pro 2017 13-inch. However, I don't feel that this laptop bring me any convenience and efficiency. There are only two Type C ports which are extremely inconvenient for me to transfer document from one hard drive to another. Worst of all, the newest keyboard is really, really unfriendly. I'm a PhD student so I need to type a lot. This keyboard is so hard to use (i.e. missing a lot of letters when typing) that even after a month I'm still not used to it, which seriously affects my writing. When you emailed us to ask for which laptop we want, I was actually anticipating getting an old or second-hand laptop left from previous students. When I was offered a brand new and newest version Pro I was so flattered. However, after a month use, I really don't think this computer suits me well. I can put up with only two ports, but the keyboard is really unbearable. I even got so angry when I'm typing this email because I have to go back and refill the missing letters multiple time. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I'm wondering if you have any old or second-hand 2015 version Pro which I can switch this one with? The laptop I'm using is still very much like a new one, no scratches, excellent performance (because I haven't used it that much, thanks to the keyboard). I can put it back into the box and it'll just like a new one. What I'm saying is that if you have a spare 2015 version Pro which is serving as a backup laptop, I'd be more than happy to have that and return this back to you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best,\n&gt; Student\n\nI offered the student the choice between an HP EliteBook (please take one, I have so many that just want love) or an Apple USB keyboard. She asked if she could have an Apple Bluetooth keyboard instead. I told her no, but also suggested that she could buy her own Bluetooth keyboard with the added bonus that she wouldn’t have to give it back to anybody.\n\n\"About that,\" she said. \"Do I have to return this MacBook when I finish?\"\n\nThe same MacBook that until now had made her angry.\n\nSo angry.\n",

        "text": "I’m the technology manager over a few resource centers at the university I’m attending, in charge of the website and all physical tech in these centers. \n\nOne day when I’d only had this job for a few weeks: I’d been working a few hours late already and was power walking across campus to my car. Right when I pulled out of the parking garage, I got a call from the manager on duty at one center. \n\nManager: Hey, the internet just stopped working on every computer (about 20) in the center!\nMe: Wait what? It’s not connecting?\nManager: No the internet just broke! We’re still open 3 more hours and students here need to use them!  \n\nAfter suggesting he check a few settings/cords/etc which he doesn’t understand, I turn around, park again, and sprint back across campus. When I get there I find that, yes, none of the computers were connected to the internet. I start checking if people changed the default settings or unplugged a computers ethernet cord and find no problems. I then climb under the desks and find our massive switch is off. I bump one cord - making the switch lights flicker. I discovered that the extension cord powering the switch - sitting very clearly next to an outlet in the middle of the floor - was unplugged (it was in a spot where it could be easily kicked out because that was the only closest outlet). I plugged it back in and WOW the internet started working again.  \n\nEven after I explained that it was just a power cord, the other manager was super impressed and kept saying how I fixed the internet so quickly. \n\nTLDR: a clueless manager made me drive back to work to plug in a switch.

        "text": "I support a couple of university buildings. Building A, where I am based, is about a decade old, while building B is an old converted school with twisty corridors and out-of-the-way offices. Many of the staff and students in building B have a printer in their office to save them navigating the labyrinth to a Xerox.\n\nWhen an academic in building B needs printer toner, they email printer.toner@university.org which is seen by both IT staff and the building B receptionist for her to fetch the required toner from building B’s cupboard and email the academic back, asking them to collect it from her desk. This saves me having to walk to building B all day fetching toners. When an academic emails for toner they usually provide their printer model. The receptionist usually then emails me, the academic or both asking what the toner number for that printer model is and then I look it up for her.\n\nMost of the printers are from HP with toner that comes in a black box with its number in big white letters along the side. I recently began ordering Office Depot’s refilled cartridges for a fraction of the price, and these come in a white box with its number in smaller black letters along the side. Last month, receptionist was unable to find an HP 36A toner because it was in one of the newer Office Depot boxes.\n\nIt was beside a box HP 35A toner on a shelf of HP toner boxes in numerical order.\n\nNow, looking up toner numbers only takes me a few Googly seconds and I don’t mind doing it, however I was off sick when she emailed me again last week. To prevent her waiting in future, I emailed her with some advice:\n\n&gt; Hi Receptionist,\n&gt;  \n&gt; You'd be quicker googling \"Printer 123AB toner\" because I don't actually have any of these numbers memorised!\n&gt;  \n&gt; This one is a 987X, bottom shelf, far right\n&gt;  \n&gt; Cheers\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kind Regards\n&gt;\n&gt; University IT\n\nSoon came the reply:\n\n&gt; Hi all,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Can you please remove Receptionist from the toner mailing list?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Office Manager\n\nIT boss and Office Manager had a chat and it seems that Googling toner numbers is legitimately too much for our receptionist to comprehend. I am now copying all of the printer models from our inventory into a spreadsheet and listing the black, cyan, magenta and yellow toner numbers for each, one by one and including variations like high capacity models, because our receptionist is unable to look these up for herself. Serves me right for trying to empower a colleague.\n\n\nGive a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he might chuck the rod and do a runner.",

        "text": "This morning help desk received a ticket saying a user in HR was transferred to a different department.  We did everything we needed to in AD for the change and told them everything was taken care of on our end. A few hours later we get a ticket saying a few of the users decided to move desks since there was more room.  I decided to go down there to check it out and make sure everything was okay.  I hooked everything up since they obviously messed it all up.  After I was done I had them check it all out and they said everything seemed to be working.  I told them to let us know if they have any issues and left. \n\nThe following happened about an hour later.\n\n&gt;HR User: \"Since my computers was move nthing is wroking.  My drive are gone and we cannt printer.\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Is this happening to everyone or are you the only one experiencing this problem?\"\n\n&gt;HR User: \"PRINTER NOT WOKRING!!! AND DRIVES GONE!!!!!!.....\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Okay, I am about to jump into your computer remotely so I can take a look at it and see if I can get it working\"\n\nI jumped into her computer and it's not logged in so I call her and ask her to log in.  Suddenly she's extremely polite and asks how she's supposed to log in and I tell her to log in with her normal username and password for Windows.  Once I'm logged in as her the first thing I do is send a test page to the printer and it works with no problems.  I looked for the mapped drive and there is a shortcut on the desktop and a link to it in file explorer, just like it's supposed to be.  I told her everything looks okay and asked her to check it out and she says it's all working. I asked her if anyone else is having trouble she says no, I hang up on the phone and close the ticket.\n\nA little while later she reopens the ticket.\n\n&gt;HR User: \"SAME THING HAPPN AGAIN CAN'T PRINTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11 DrIVES GON\"\n\nI remote into her computer again and I see the username HRUser2.  \n\n&gt; Me:  \"You are logged in as HRUser2 instead of HRUser.  It's not working because you are not logged in as yourself on your computer.\"\n\n&gt;HR USER: \"HRUSER2 SAR HERE BEFORE I LOG IN AS HRUSER2 NOW!.\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"You have to log into your computer as yourself you can't log into your computer as a different user.\"\n\n&gt;HRUSER: \"THT DONT MK SINCE SHE SAT HEER BEFORE!!!1\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"The desk has nothing to do with how you log in.  You are still using the same computer you were before so you will still log in with the same username and password that you used before you moved.  Also, I am resetting HRUser2's password so you can't log in as her again.  You need to log in as yourself, and you shouldn't know another user's password, that's against company policy and it's also a security risk.\"\n\n&gt;HR User: \"U R NO HELP!!1!! ! I WNT SPEAK WIT YOUR MANAGER\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"Ma'am I am the manager of Helpdesk, but if you'd like to speak with my supervisor you can reach him here (###)###-#### or here ITDirector@company.com.  Also, here is a link to the employee handbook Section # Article # it states that no user shall log in as another user unless given permission by their immediate supervisor.\"\n\nI haven’t heard anything yet and left shortly after all of this was done.  I guess I’ll find out tomorrow if she actually did try to contact my boss.\n\nUpdate: When I got to work this morning I printed off the ticket and took it to my supervisor.  I asked him if he heard anything from HR about it and he said he hasn't.  He read it, laughed and put it in a folder in his desk labeled \"Folder of shame :(\".  My guess is that she decided it wasn't worth the trouble to try to file a complaint or something.  I doubt she realized that she was wrong.  He said he will let the HR manager know about it and recommend a meeting with HR User about company policy and grammar. \n\ntldr: User moves to old co-worker’s desk, thinks she needs to log in as the old co-worker.  Argues though email and might have filed a complaint against me.\n",

She told us that she couldn't get the usb cable she had unplugged from the case and after one of her students 'helped\" her She then couldn't get it to fit again. \n\nI was sent to her classroom a bit before her next class to take a look at the computer and if needed replace it with one i had brought with me. I Sit down at a desk and look over the port and i'm horrified at what I see. It looked like someone had taken something like scissors and broken the metal on the inside. I Asked her if i could see the cable she had stuck inside and when i looked the outside was completely scratched and cut from what I was guessing was a very sharp knife. \n\nI couldn't do anything further there so i asked her who was the student that \"fixed\" the cable and she tells me he's some guy who told her he could fix her problem. It took a few minutes but i got a brief description of him and went off to the repair station to see what the extent of the damage was. \nAfter seeing what happened all it would take to fix it was actually just replacing the port because surprisingly nothing was seriously damaged by him jabbing metal inside and prying the cable out. \n\nI left to tell my boss what happened and he asked around if anyone knew the guy i just described to him. and one of the secretaries surprisingly knew the guy. He's some animation student who had recently gotten in trouble for carrying a giant knife on his backpack. \n\nMy boss Called campus security and from what i was told a few hours ago the guy had a class the next morning.

Sit back, relax and enjoy.... \n\n\nSo it's been a while since my last post, I'm still at university and going well. As a bit of a background to this story I am an adult volunteer within a youth group that is sponsored by the military in my country for kids between 12 and 18 (not very tech related so far). It teaches stuff like camping, navigation, shooting and some army skills etc. Great stuff. Unfortunately that age range can typically be the worst for the \"my little snowflake\" parents who insist that their child is the best thing since sliced bread and has to be treated accordingly. \n\nQue to one of the parade nights at our detachment (place we meet) that is situated in a reserve centre (place where part time soldiers train). For security reasons one of us must be at the front gate to make sure no dodgy fellas get in and cause problems (remember: military location), that was me that night. A car with an unknown number plate comes up to the gate and sits there with headlights on (despite the huge clear sign saying **'Turn off all headlights'** as they can blind the guard, important when they need to see who is in it). \n\nAfter about 30 seconds of me not opening the vehicle gate, the driver starts honking their horn presumably to make me open it. I shoot a *wtf* look and they honk again. I have no intention of opening it without finding out who is driving this thing. I exit the pedestrian gate and start walking up to the car with a torch in hand, knock on the window and ask the driver to roll down the window. What appeared in front of me was a very huffy looking woman with a kid in an army uniform in the passenger seat...\n\n&gt;$me: Can I see some identification and what your business here is please?\n\n&gt;$angryLady: I'm dropping my kid off, open the gate (doesn't show any ID).\n\n&gt;$me: I cant let parent vehicles inside the compound. You are not an authorised person nor are you driving an authorised vehicle.\n\n&gt;$angryLady: *Visibly upset* It's cold and my baby (who calls their kid baby anymore??) needs to get inside!\n\n&gt;$me: He can get out and walk the five metres to the building door.\n\n&gt;$angryLady: He can't do that he'll freeze!\n\n&gt;$me: Do you have a military ID?\n\n&gt;$angryLady: No.\n\n&gt;$me: then the vehicle cant come in...\n\nShe huffs and puffs and swears a bit under her breath, kisses her son goodbye and lets him go in (what a trooper for braving the sub-arctic conditions....not). \n\n&gt;$angryLady: I want to know why I wasn't told about next week's change of plans either. \n\n&gt;$me: It was put up on a post in the Facebook group for them a few days ago. He should be in it.\n\n&gt;$angryLady: HE'S TOO YOUNG TO BE ON THE FACEBOOK! (said in a loud screeching tone, the kid is like 14 calm down lady)\n\n&gt;$me: then he was told last week about it and he should have written it down.... You can join that group so you know what's going on in the future.\n\n&gt;$angryLady: *smugly* I don't want you to get my personal information so no I will not be joining it. (Way to go lady, here is where the tech related stuff comes in) I want to speak to your commander about this!\n\n&gt;$me: Ok then miss, please park on the road away from the gate, bring a form of ID and leave any excess bags in the car. I will be able to escort you to the office.\n\nShe huffs and puffs again saying 'bullshit' under her breath like I'm deaf or something, throws on her high beams to add insult to injury and spins the car round nearly hitting the wall in the process. She then parks at a crazy angle and slams her door, locking it in the process. She follows me in without much else of a fuss and sits at the Commanding Officer's desk. She shoots me a death glare and waits. The Commanding Officer (CO) walks in and sits down:\n\n$angryLady will be $AL from here on...\n\n&gt;$CO: Good evening miss how can I be of help tonight?\n\n&gt;$AL: I want to know why I'm not being told about changes to the training location next week. This is **my** son we're talking about not just some random person. \n\n&gt;$CO: *Visibly confused*  Well we have a facebook group that we circulate information like this on. It's a closed and secure group that only us instructors, kids, and their parents can see what's on there. It is very useful as it means that the information is easy to see and always visible.\n\n&gt;$AL: *screetchy voice again and shouting* MY SON IS TOO YOUNG TO BE ON THE FACEBOOK YOU SHOULD FIND ANOTHER WAY OF TELLING ME\n\n$CO is not a man that appreciates being randomly shouted at by people. Most of the time he will shout back and make you be polite, this lady nearly sent him over the edge less than two minutes after meeting him. \n\n&gt;$CO: *visibly angry and talking through gritted teeth* Then I suggest you join this group to get this information if your son is unable to note it down the previous week... Here Sgt. Flyingpancakeattack can show you (oh no, anything but me having to deal with her further). \n\n&gt;$AL: No. I don't want your facebook group to know my personal information!\n\n&gt;$CO: That's not how it works, I assure you it's perfectly safe. \n\nAfter much bickering and moaning from $AL about how people can steal her information she agrees to be added to the group:\n\n&gt;$AL: So how do I join then? Can I do it here? (Here's where the fun begins and the story turns into a tech one)\n\n&gt;$CO: Sgt. Flyingpancakeattack will show you how to join. I have sent you the invite to it.\n\nI get my laptop out and and set it onto the desk. I log on, sign out of my Facebook account and show her the login screen while $CO leaves the room to cool off and get $AL a cup of tea or something. \n\nShe just stares gormless at the screen.\n\n&gt;$AL: What do I do? (I swear to god she has to be kidding)\n\n&gt;$me: Type your email and password into the top two boxes labelled 'Username or Email' and 'Password'\n\n&gt;$AL: I don't want you keeping my information on your computer!\n\n&gt;$me: I have unticked 'remember me', so when you log out nothing of your's is saved. \n\nShe seems satisfied with that answer and types her email into the box. When she clicks on the password entry she snaps her head round exorcist-style at me and comes out with this gem:\n\n&gt;$AL **Don't you dare look at my password** \n\nShe hunches her shoulders and arms over the keyboard all gremlin like to hide it, presses her face against the screen (ew) and slowly but surely types her password in and clicks 'Log In'. I am fully convinced at this point she is nuts and probably midlife crisis has hit her hard, thus the batshit insane paranoia. She decided to try to cover her news feed with her hand as I look over to her screen to point out the globe icon for the group invite. \n\n&gt;$me: Go ahead and click the globe icon with the notification on it....\n\n&gt;$AL: *shrill voice* I can't see it!\n\n&gt;$me: *points again* Here.\n\n&gt;$AL: You should have told me it's right there, you aren't very helpful. (Really? Last time I checked I can find the damn icon not you....)\n\n&gt;$me: now click on the 'accept' button where it says \"Group Invite\".\n\nBy some small miracle she gets it right and goes onto the page, and then:\n\n&gt;$AL: If I get my details stolen because of this I'll be looking to sue you..\n\n&gt;$me: *internally want to smash my head against the wall until it's pulp*  Okayy, please now log out. \n\n&gt;$AL: I don't know how I never log out usually. \n\nFollowing a rather painstaking and lengthy explanation of how to log out (she refused to let me do it for her for the usual reasons), I had just about had enough and took the laptop away and logged back into my account. This didn't stop $AL from peaking over my shoulder and being nosy on my Facebook... Just then $CO walks back in after maybe crying out of frustration. \n\n&gt;$CO: Are we all sorted now Miss angryLady?\n\n&gt;$AL: *In a snootish tone* Yes I suppose so, I expect you both to apologise to my son for not getting the correct information to me. As for you *points at me* I hope you learn to be more useful as you are and idiot...\n\n$CO and I just looked at her with more *wtf*. She had also peeked over to me and saw me access a military web portal on my laptop to update some records, that just so happened to be some sensitive files unrelated to her or her son when she bleated out:\n\n$AL: WHAT IS THAT FOR I KNEW YOU WOULD STEAL MY SON'S INFORMATION!!. \n\nShe tried to snatch my laptop away but I quickly shut it and told her it was \"Sensitive and you can't see them\". $AL attempted to force her way to the laptop at which $CO slammed his hand on his desk, stopping $AL in her tracks.\n\nHe finally had enough.\n\n&gt;$CO: YOU WILL NOT TREAT MY STAFF LIKE A CRIMINAL MISS ANGRYLADY. SGT. FLYINGPANCAKEATTACK HAS HELPED YOU WITH MORE THAN HE NEEDED. *quietens down*. I suggest you apologise to him now and reevaluate your tone before I am forced to remove you from this building.\n\n$AL sits down and bursts into tears and lets loose a whole load of things. She had just gone through with a divorce with her husband, leaving the kid under her care, the parade nights were a small relief from her looking after her son for a few hours and get some rest. The fact that she was a victim of fraud as well was the main reason she was so paranoid about agreeing to things online and her personal info. She did say sorry and thanked me for the help. \n\nWhile I appreciate and certainly cant imagine the stress $AL was going though, neither $CO or me appreciated her trying to take it out on us. After calming down, she asked to be escorted out. She left without another word and waited in her car when she came to pick up the kid later.\n\nHer son wandered into the office, and had obviously been crying. He apologised for his mum's outburst and said that she does that a lot because of the divorce. I feel for the guy as it probably wasn't the first time something like this has happened. It's horrible to see a child (despite being older) take on some of the burden of the parent. \n\nI kept an eye on him for a while to make sure his situation wasn't getting worse. Seems to be doing OK last time I had a chat.\n\nThe moral of this story is despite not being tech heavy, sometimes a user can be going through so much that they lash out at the closest problem, try to have as much patience as you can.\n\n**TL:DR** Don't judge a (Face)book by it's cover.\n \n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Some side information: I work for an independent school in the UK as an IT Tech. We are a small school but some of the staff have been around decades. We’ve had this fleet of leased copiers for a few years now and this happened today. \n\n$Me = Me\nLovely but in over her head old lady = Judy (Name a fake)\n\nSo today started like any other. Our server went down. A mixture of issues mainly my useless boss but that’s a story for another time. Our copiers run from the server to print from any copier in the school from any computer. With the network down they had to be turned on photocopy mode so teachers can make do. So I go get my morning cup of coffee being stopped every two steps about the network being down. I go past a room with a copier and Judy is there slamming buttons with a stack of paper in her hands. So I walk in and put on my best happy face. \n\n$Me: Good morning Judy, what’s going wrong?\nJudy: Well I was told the copier worked but I can’t get it off of 2 sided! \n\nSo I look at the screen and there’s 4 options the second is showing 1 pages being copied into an exact copy. \n\n$Me: Oh this one (presses option she needs) will work. It says it’s two sided but it’ll work just fine.\nJudy: But it’s for two sided copying i only want to copy one side. \n$Me: Oh i understand that but i promise it will work like you want it to. \n\nSo she tries but presses the wrong option, somehow thinking what i pressed was not what i meant. \n\n$Me: No no, that won’t work right \n(Frantically cancelling job)\n$Me: Use this option\n(Press option to duplicate her work)\nJudy: Oh ok i understand!\n$Me: Great! I’ll just be down in the kitchen getting a coffee if you need me\n\nThe kitchen is Just next door and is meant to be just for admin  but teachers use it anyway. So while stirring my cup of spoon bending coffee in walks Judy while I’m chatting to a colleague holding a box of paper.\n\n$Me: So did you get on alright with the copying?\nJudy: No I pressed 1 by accident when typing 20 and it did 120. I didn’t know how to cancel it so I’ll just have a lot of spares for the lesson.\n\nI’m left dumb struck and she walks off to her lesson like nothing was odd about all of that. At least they were copied correctly.\n\nTLDR: Staff member gets confused about how photocopiers work and accidentally copies 120 times. She just rolls with it.\n",

        "text": "I love my mother dearly. She and I may not always see eye-to-eye, but I do love her to death.\n\nMy mother is 68, and, as like many her age, is not good with technology, but she listens and is willing to learn, so she is slowly getting better. She has a smart phone and is relatively competent with it, in that she can play her games, take pictures and browse $bacefook. That said, there are still occasions when something comes up that is past her skills, and I'll get a phone call or message asking for help.\n\nSo, a couple of months ago, I get a message from her. Seems her phone is not able to read her micro SD card. Reseating it and restarting the phone have yielded no success, and a $bigredcell rep told her it's corrupted and that she'd likely need a new card. It's a few years old, so, it isn't unreasonable to think it's given up the ghost. She resigns herself to getting a new one.\n\nHowever, there are some pictures and such on the old card that she'd like to hang on to if possible. So, she asks me if I can help her. Nothing urgent. \"Get to it when you can,\" she says. Being the good son I am, I gladly oblige. Next time I see her, she hands me said card.\n\nAt home a couple of days later, I get to work on it. A quick Google search told me what steps needed to be taken to resolve the issue. Easy command line stuff, but even that is well past her skill set. I pop the card into an adapter, slide it into my computer, scan for bad things (out of habit, and it came back clean), then see that the card is indeed showing nothing there, as expected. Time to run the necessary commands.\n\nHuzzah! We have recovered files!\n\nSo, I start going through the folder tree to track down the pictures and other assorted files she mentioned she wanted saved. What I saw about turned my blood cold.\n\nAll in non-password-protected Excel format, I see files named \"Accounts and Passwords,\" \"Credit and Debit Cards,\" and \"Important Info.\" To confirm my fears, I open up \"Accounts and Password.\" Yep, there's all the login information for her and my dad's email accounts, various bill-pay sites, banks, Amazon, etc. \"Credit and Debit Cards\" yields full card numbers with expiration dates AND CCV codes.\n\n\"Important Info\" was even worse, as it had her and my father's social security numbers, AND, for some unexplained reason, the same info for me and my siblings.\n\nMy wife walked up to me about this time, saw how pale I was, and asked me what was wrong. When I told her, she swore quietly and said, \"She's lost her mind.\" Given the evidence, I couldn't disagree.\n\nRecovering my composure, I removed my PII, along with the same of my siblings from that \"Important Info\" file. I then continued to track down the pictures and such she wanted. Easily finding them, they all got saved onto a spare USB drive, along with the Excel files. The card then goes through the shredder.\n\nWhen I gave the USB drive to my mom a few days later, I had a loving but stern talk with her about the ills of carrying such information around. I understand her memory isn't what it used to be, and this is her way of writing things down, but I still can't fathom why she would feel the need to carry around on the phone with her instead of leaving it on her airgapped home $Winders machine.\n\nWaiter, egg nog, please, heavy on the rum.\n",

        "text": "LTL; FTP; feedback on formatting would be appreciated!  \n\nThis story comes courtesy of the _very_ small cloud office phone start-up I worked with a few years ago. A pretty basic Voip service but all control and configuration of the phones comes from the cloud. All the user has to do is plug it into their network.   \n\nBecause it is so simple, we didn't offer IT to our clients. Most of them already had their IT guy. So if there was a problem outside the cloud or their physical phone, it was their IT's problem. (_Hint_: 99% of calls were their problem)  Pretty simple division of responsibility, right?\n\nSo, cue my coworker, **$vet**, a military veteran, getting a ticket from one of our locations...  \n\n&gt; All the phones are down.  \n\nSo **$vet** calls their location to see what's happening (_Note: we have backup contact info if their phones are actually down. But we always started by calling the main location, because users lie..._) \n\n&gt; **$secretary**: Thank you for calling  **$location_where_all_the_phones_are_down**, how can I help you today?\n\n&gt; _yep...I can really tell just how down **all** these phones are..._\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Yes, I'm calling about an issue you reported with your phones?\n\n&gt; **$secretary**: Oh? I haven't heard anything, let me check around...  \n\n&gt; ...  \n\n&gt; **$secretary**: Yes. That was **$cl** who was having problems. I'll transfer you.\n\n&gt; **$cl**: Hello?\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Yes, this is $vet. I heard you were having problems with your phone.\n\n&gt; **$cl**: All the phones are down.\n\n&gt; **$vet**: We're talking on one of your phones right now. So at least some of them are working. Could you be more specific about which phones are having a problem?\n\n&gt; **$cl**: ALL of them!\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Okay.\n\n&gt; **$vet**: What exactly is the problem you're experiencing with the phones?\n\n&gt; **$cl**: The phones are all down! You need to fix this. We have work to do!\n\n&gt; **$vet**: -.- _le sigh_\n\n_pullingteeth.exe_\n\nAs **$vet** beat around the bush with **$cl**, he delved into our management software and saw three phones were reporting as offline. 3 out of a few dozen... Now seeing a block of phones like this offline while the rest of the location's phones work, basically guarantees the problem is a switch that has gone bad. I.E. get your IT to fix your crappy network lady!\n\n&gt; **$vet**: It looks like extensions xxx, yyy, and zzz are down. Is that right?\n\n&gt; **$cl**: Yes, those are all the phones down in the back room where we work.\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Okay, when we see a group of phones stop working like this it usually indicates a problem with your internal network; so you should call your IT and they'll be able to fix this for you. \n\n&gt; **$cl**: No, this is a problem on your end. You need to fix it.\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Well, we can do a little more trouble shooting to narrow things down.\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Are there any computers in this back room? And do they have a wired connection to the internet?\n\n&gt; **$cl**: YES! They've been down all day too!\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Well if that back room doesn't have a connection to the internet, then the phones won't work either. Has anything happened recently that might have knocked out your internet?\n\n&gt; **$cl**: Well... our building did get struck by lightning over the weekend..\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Uhhh, yeah. Lightining will definitely destroy network equipment. You should call IT to have them replace any fried equipment. If you still have a problem after that, you can call us again.\n\n&gt; **$cl**: No. The PHONES aren't working, you're the PHONE company. YOU need to fix this.\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Ma'am this is an internal network issue. Your IT are the only people who can help with that, if you still have problems after the network is fixed we will be here to help you.\n\n&gt; **$cl**: So you aren't going to help me!?\n\n&gt; **$vet**: Your service is working. We've made test calls and we've been able to talk on your phone this whole time. You need to call your IT and have them repair damage to your network from the lightning strike.\n\n&gt; **$cl**: Unbelievable! I should have never told you about the lightning!!\n\n_click_\n\n...\n\nLater that week we got a message from their IT: _Replaced a fried switch in the back room. All the phones are working now. Thanks_\n\nTL;DR - Don't tell techs any relevant information  kids, because then they'll know... _the real cause of your problems_... _shudder_",

        "text": "I do tech support for a large $company that has more than 500 employees in the building I work in. My support ranges from programmers to the elite. \n\nLast week, I got a call from one of the owners ($owner) of the $company having trouble with email. This email was from the Church she goes to, and she was concerned about the email not reaching her inbox. The protocol for people of her tier is just to do whatever they want - they are incredibly nice people, and usually their solutions are simple, but not all the time 100% work-related. This fit the bill closely, except for the simple solution part. \n\nI checked her Outlook settings (she had no rules set), checked her spam filter, and even checked our on-site spam quarantine filter (also empty). The email had never entered her inbox, basically. To clarify, this is one of those mass emails that they send out that goes to the entire congregation.\n\nI asked her if I could contact the Church's IT guy ($church), and she agreed, and I got his phone number and discussed this with him. He said that the problem was **definitely on our side** (note this) and that he could send some test emails. Agreeing to the test-email part, I let him send one to the $owner. I don't see it pop up in her email or spam at all. This information is relayed back to him, and I tell him to try again with my work email. Same issue. After researching their domain, I find out it's Gmail based, so I, for the hilarity of it all, tell him to send a test email to my personal Gmail. No dice. I'm pretty convinced at this point that it's going to be their issue, but I'm kind of too nice and offer that I check with the Exchange server admins to see if the email is even hitting our email servers at all - you know, just to eliminate any possibility that it could be us. He agrees with that, and I tell him I'd report my findings. Lo and behold, the Exchange admin tells me that he's never seen an email come through from their newsletter to $owner. \n\nI return to $owner's desk and do a few more basic troubleshooting steps with $church. \n\nThen he hits me with a whopper. Something of which I didn't even think. Of course! This makes him innocent! It's not his problem, it's my $company's!\n\nDamn. Here I was, the lazy tech support dude that never does any troubleshooting, thinking I could get off scott-free. \n\nHe confidently tells me, \"Your ISP is obviously blocking the emails.\" I could feel the passive-aggressive smile through the phone.\n\nThat would be true, you know, except the fact that we are our own ISP. I tell him that I'm 100% certain that we are not blocking their newsletters.\n\nThis conversation kind of turns to nonsense, but $church eventually just gets down to telling us that since we're our own ISP, we're going to have to troubleshoot the software that they use (????). He sends me a manual on their mass-email software and pretty much just tells me to \"check.\" What the hell am I supposed to do with that? \n\nI pretty much tell $church to go to the other IT guy he said he had, and he said that he might check, but he stayed pretty headstrong in the fact that it was our fault that their software was malfunctioning. I let $owner know about what transpired, she said it's cool and thank you, and I worried about other things for that day. \n\nFast forward a week, and $owner reaches back out to me, asking what happened with Anonymous' Sacred Church of Not Sending Emails, with $church attached. I tell her that after some tests, I encouraged $church's team to investigate from their end. \n\n$church snapped back at me, making sure the CC the owner in the email. He said that he was disappointed and aggravated that I blamed him for the emails coming through. He told me that pointing fingers got nobody anywhere and that I should grow up. Refer to the bold print above. \n\nAnyways, while I know he was full of crap, I just felt a little wary, given how I didn't know $owner was going to respond to all of this. \n\n$owner called me, and the tension was on. I began to apologize for the weird behavior from $church, but she hushed me. She said I was to not contact $church anymore, because he was unprofessional, and it was the last straw - she and her family revoked their membership from the church. \n\nTL;DR: Judge lest ye be judged.

        "text": "This happened in September but I've not had time until now to post about it.\n\nOne of my clients was expanding into more space next door to their existing office space and as a result needed a new Ethernet switch. Their existing switches were very old and a mix of small 100 mbps units with one 8 port gigabit switch that previous IT firms had installed, and I convinced them to let me replace everything with a nice pair of stacked 48 port gigabit switches in a nice compact wall mount rack.\n\nThe office manager and I scheduled the upgrade for a weekend and she emailed the staff to let them know they shouldn't come in if they needed access to the computer systems. I came in as planned with my part time assistant, we did the upgrade (even set up VLANs for data and future VOIP), tested everything and went home. One of those projects that went as well as it possibly could.\n\nOn Monday morning I get a call from the office manager. One of the staff's systems is dead as a doornail and the user is blaming it on the upgrade, demanding a replacement (in the background I hear her say \"and tell him it needs to be a better one!\"), basically causing all kinds of Monday morning drama. I knew it wasn't related to replacing the switches of course - the user is one of those high maintenance types who always blames her computer or the server for her problems, even though that's never been the case. But regardless of what caused it I still had to go on site and fix it, so off I went.\n\nWhen I arrived the user had the system pulled out and sitting on her desk with a note that said \"Broken by DallasITGuy over the weekend - REPLACE IMMEDIATELY!\". And of course said user was nowhere to be found. I hooked it back up and sure enough, it wouldn't power up. Since the user wasn't there I went ahead and stayed at her desk and opened the case up, figuring maybe it was something straightforward.\n\nAs soon as I opened it up it was apparent someone had intentionally broken it. The video card was broken and the power feed to the motherboard had been pulled out and cracked with a pair of pliers. I took a quick photo and got the office manager to take a look. Manager freaks of course, tracks down the user, gets her back to her desk. Situation rapidly deteriorates with accusations flying. \n\nI finally had to go to the server and (with the office manager and owner looking over my shoulder and having me explain every step of what I'm doing) go through the logs and prove that the user had logged in on that system for a few minutes first thing that day and then logged off - meaning the system had been working when she arrived. \n\nThey were beyond pissed. Told me to take the broken system back to my office and fix it or replace it and after I left sat down with the user, got her to admit she'd damaged the computer (her reason: she felt like she deserved a faster one) and fired her. Got back to my office and there was an email waiting for me telling me to disable her account and bring the system back immediately as they were going to take the cost of it out of her last check and wanted to keep the system as evidence in case she filed for unemployment benefits.\n\nTL;DR: User destroys system to get a better one, blames failure on switch upgrade, gets caught, fired, and charged for the cost of said system.",

That is the majority, however, there is a minority who I wouldn't pee on even if they were on fire. Bit extreme? Maybe.\n\nWhere I work we use a very popular printing software which handles the holding of the jobs on our server as well as pricing up the jobs. What happens is, when a user sends a job to one of the photocopiers it holds that print job until they log in with a four digit code to release it. Simple enough to use I think, right? \n\nThis particular story involves $me and $foreverdisgruntled, who is actually forever disgruntled. They're never satisfied, never happy! \n\n$foreverdisgruntled is no longer a colleague of mine luckily but some of the things they have done really take the biscuit, so to speak. They were luckily only an employee on a temporary basis.\n\nWhen someone starts working where I work it is important that I run them through the basics of our IT equipment, most importantly how to use the dreaded photocopiers. $foreverdisgruntled tried to play it cool on their first day, they were at the forefront of being IT literate. I've seen this before with many colleagues past and present. I show $foreverdisgruntled how to use the photocopiers anyway even though they claimed to know how to use it.\n\nA day or two pass and $foreverdisgruntled makes their way to my office for what would be the first time out of many upon many visits.\n\n$foreverdisgruntled: The photocopiers don't work, why can't I just log in, I have the right code!\n\n$me: Oh right okay, what code are you using?\n\nSo they tell me their code, it seems to be the right one. I tend to make the codes something personal to me or something that I'll remember. For instance, I went through a phase of making codes based on the numbers from LOST, geeky I know.\n\nI go ahead and confirm they have the right code through the printing software. Yes, it's right.\n\nSo I told them to come with me and we went to one of the photocopiers. \n\n$me: Show me exactly what you're doing so I can try and diagnose further.\n\n$foreverdisgruntled: I bet it'll work now, don't see why, things should just work.\n\nSo I stand back and watch as I see one of the funniest moments of my career as an IT tech so far. When you log into these photocopiers you see an empty field and a keyboard icon next to it. The user presses the keyboard and you'll never believe what they do. They start typing out their code in words. \n\nI've never ever felt like face palming someone other than me in my life but in that moment I was SO close.\n\nI have to keep my composure in these situations and act normal, not to offend people who clearly don't listen to instructions the first time.\n\n$me: Right okay, delete what you've just typed and use the numbers.\n\n$foreverdisgruntled: Oh.\n\nThat was their reply, nothing else. No thanks.\n\nSo, $foreverdisgruntled you are truly welcome...",

Once you're there it should ask you for a code. \n\n&gt; $RL: Alright, I'm there. \n\n&gt; $ME: Go ahead and enter in XXXXXXX.\n\n&gt; $RL: Where do I enter that? Do I put that in the Google search that came up or do I put that in somewhere else?\n\n&gt; $ME: If you go to the &lt;remote support URL&gt; directly it will ask you for a key. \n\n&gt; $RL: I see it now, what was that code?\n\n&gt; XXXXXXX. Make sure you click where it says to click or it won't work. *yay web development* Then you need to run the file. \n\n&gt; $RL: I don't see anything!\n\n&gt; $ME: Can you go back and click on the button that says &lt;variant of click me in giant bold letters&gt;.\n\n&gt; $RL: I DID, but I'll do it again... Okay it downloaded a file. I clicked cancel because it looked like a virus.\n\n&gt; $ME: Go ahead and click the button again and run that file. It's not a virus. It will allow me to see your PC and fix this issue. \n\nSo I get into her machine and it's a printer issue, as usual. I spent some time trying to troubleshoot the issue. Eventually I'm stuck and need some input from the user. \n\n&gt; $ME: Can you do me a favor and unplug the printer from the wall and wait about 10 seconds and plug it back in. \n\n&gt; $RL: *HUGE sigh* Fine, hold on. \n\nI start pinging the device to make sure it goes down... Surprise surprise, it doesn't. \n\n&gt; $RL: *picks up phone and eats microphone* OKAY I DID THAT. \n\n&gt; $ME: Alright I didn't see it go down, is anyone else able to print? (Thinking it's a network issue)\n\n&gt; $RL: Yeah the lady who's printer it is. \n\n&gt; $ME: Is it possible for me to remote into that machine and check some things?\n\n&gt; $RL: Yeah do that. \n\n&gt; $ME: I need her to go to the &lt;remote support URL&gt;. \n\n&gt; $RL: Oh, she can't do that. She's too busy for this. You know that?! It's fine! I'll just print to the printer down the hall!\n\n&gt; $ME: If you're absolutely sure, though I think there is an issue with the printer itself and I'd-\n\n&gt; $RL: It's fine! Thanks anyway! *slams phone down as hard as she can*\n\nWell, when she slammed the phone down, it didn't hangup properly, so before I disconnected I heard this.\n\n&gt; $RL: &lt;MSP Name&gt; is useless &lt;co-worker name whos printer we were trying to get connected to&gt;. \n\n&gt; $coworker: I still can't print either. \n\nI just closed that ticket and went on my way. If I get a bad review I'll make sure to bring up the fact she hung up saying it was okay. I'm just trying to help you and you want to be rude the entire time? Welcome to Tech Support I guess. ",

I notice that when she begins clicking on the folders that the speed of her clicks are uh, latent. I keep asking her to double click and she starts to get upset, telling me she's worked with computers for 15+ years so she knows how to double click the mouse. I agree and ask her to give me 5 minutes and I'll come get her when I'm done. I adjust the mouse double click settings to the near turtle speed and let her know I fixed the problem. She's working fine now and I'm ready for the hole in my wall to become a little larger.\n\nTL;DR: dept. manager can't open anything on new PC.

Seeing that behemoth reminded me of this situation with a simple fix but a puzzling cause.\n\nA new woman had started in office and her desk was configured with all the latest and greatest hardware that we had at the time. I met her on the first day; she was super nice and eager to get started in her new job. I gave her my phone number and wished her well.\n\nNL = Nice Lady, user\nDT = Desktop Tech, ME\n\nNice Lady calls the day after she started:\n\nNL: Hello, DT. This is NL, we met yesterday. I'm sorry to bother you so soon, but I have a problem that I've tried to fix and simply can not figure it out.\n\nDT: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think that this is a software problem or a hardware issue?\n\nNL: I don't really know. There is a black box on my screen. I can't close it or drag it someplace else and it's blocking anything that comes up behind it.\n\nDT: I'll be right down.\n\nI approach her desk and can see the black box as I walk up. We chat for a minute, I look around a bit and then see the PiP button on the monitor. Press that button and the black box is no more.\n\nNL: Thank you so much. I looked at all those buttons but didn't understand what many of their icons meant.\n\nI head back to my desk and finish out my day. The next morning, I get a call again:\n\nNL: DT, this is NL. First, you don't have to do anything, but the black box was there again this morning. I pushed the same button that you did yesterday and it went away. I just wanted you to know.\n\nDT: I'm glad that you called, thanks for letting me know. Let's keep an eye on this.\n\nIt's a single button push and the problem is gone, so I let this go for a couple weeks. She doesn't call EVERY morning to say that it's back, but more often than not. I swap out the monitor, tell her that I did that (before she came in) and to still let me know if it happens.\n\nAnd it DOES happen. Not every morning, but often. I went back down to her desk when I first got in one morning and sat in her chair pondering life and struggling to think of how this could be happening, especially after swapping in a new monitor. I was literally sitting there staring at the monitor like it was a crystal ball when I actually noticed the document stand sitting on the desk in front of it...\n\nNL wasn't in the office yet, so I can see the full stand with no papers on it. A slanted white wooden back with an edge at the bottom to hold the documents and the curve of the back, in one small area, put the height in perfect alignment with the PiP button.\n\nThe second shift cleaning crew moves stuff around to wipe down the desks, apparently moved the document stand into the PiP button to engage it and turn on the \"black box.\"",

        "text": "I’m an instructional technologist at a university. My coworker and I provide online and phone support for faculty using our LMS, Canvas. One, large school (LS) has their own IT, I’ll call “Jane”. \n\nThis past summer, the Turnitin API (the educational software that checks for plagiarism) changed to LTI, and we’ve had nothing but problems since. Issues range from intermittent outages to new settings specifications. For example, users can no longer apply “available to, from” dates on assignments and can only use due dates. Canvas is pretty good about communicating outages in their own LMS but Turnitin is not. We usually just have to deal with it for a few hours and (if we know about an outage) communicate this information with faculty submitting helpdesk tickets. \n\nLast week, my colleague was contacted by the dean of LS. A man we know well -I’ll call Egomaniac (EM)- is in some hot water over some late student essays. (While we do not technically support EM’s department, he’ll call us for support every once in a while and is generally awful. In one instance, he called my colleague and demanded she take him off speakerphone while she provided support, even though she assured him she was in her personal, locked office, alone.)\n\nEM has a very strict, no late paper rule. LS dean told us she respects this rule and doesn’t tend to interfere, but is concerned about this case in particular. Apparently, an important student project in a year 4 class that would pretty much determine whether you pass the course and graduate, was due on a Friday at 11:59 PM. At 8 PM, EM got word that Turnitin was being glitchy from a few students, so he set up a separate assignment submission area in the event students couldn’t submit to Turnitin that night. He sent out a Canvas message to all students, notifying them of this. The next day, he’s contacted by four students who say they tried to submit to Turnitin by midnight, but it didn’t work. They tell him they didn’t know about the alternative submission area because they didn’t check their email. \n\nHe tells them he won’t accept their paper, but then changes his mind and allows them to submit pending an investigation. He tells these four students in class that if they bother and “harass” him about whether or not he will accept their papers, they all get zeros. \n\nWe go in to investigate the student submissions. From our admin accounts, we can only see the areas students visit in Canvas -we can’t see if they tried to submit a document. We visit the four student accounts and see that between about 11:40 and 11:59, all four visited the area where you would submit a paper. We report this to LS dean and EM. LS dean seems relieved and thinks this will be the end of the problem, EM, on the other hand, becomes argumentative in a series of emails. \n\nFirst, he complains that there was no communication about Turnitin being down. We tell him that there are intermittent issues with the program that often go unreported and remind him that he *knew* about the problems that night, because he created a separate area for submissions. Then, he wants us to go into each student’s inbox to see if they read his message about the separate assignment submission area. We decline, saying we will not violate student privacy and read their messages. \n\nWe review his Turnitin assignment settings to see if he set it up correctly, then find that he added “available to, from” dates which causes problems in Turnitin. We point this out to him, and he writes back, saying, “Oh, I didn’t set up the assignment, Jane (the other IT) did!”\n\nEM sends a few more emails complaining about our department and Canvas in general, that we ignore.\n\nAt this point I am angry and have to calm down my extremely pissed off coworker. There is a decent amount of evidence there were issues with Turnitin, and it has clearly become a matter of pride for the guy at this point. She contacts LS dean to tell her we have nothing else to contribute to this case, and EM needs to stop sending us combative emails. She understands and says she will communicate this with him. Offhandedly she says, “I’m glad he’s retiring at the end of this semester!”\n",

        "text": "Good morning, almost afternoon TFTS! LL;FTP here. Strap in, because I bring you this embarrassing tale fresh from this morning. \n\n**Some background:**\n\nOver the last 4 or so years I have been a Sr. Network Security Engineer. I got my start in tech a bit over 10 years ago, and like some from here I imagine, my profession was born from my hobby, and fascination with tech. My first tech job ever was working in a datacenter as a rack-monkey, that was the nick name given to the help desk minions that were in-charge of anything from racking and stacking new equipment, to running cable drops, and new racks. You get the idea. Since moving up the ladder in my career it's been a while since I did any physical work in a data center, other than the time I had to fly to one and grab a crash cart to jack into some networking equipment, but that is a tale for another time. \n\nLately, I have been looking for a new opportunity following a round of lay-off's at the previous place I was at. So in the mean time I was welcomed back at a small business with around 50 employee's or so to \"fix up\" the in-house datacenter, and add some new equipment. The last piece to this is that during my original time at said company (**$OldCompany**), I was one of the ones who originally built the in-house data center and network. It has grown since my time then. \n\n**The Tale:**\n\n**$OldCompany** has a fairly impressive in-house data room now for a small(er) company. Some of the bigger items consist of 5 fully loaded Dell m1000E blade chassis, and blades, along with SSD fronted Equallogic SANs, a legacy EMC/Robotic tape library, 10Gbps Cisco switch stack, and a 4507 core, and a nice Check Point firewall cluster. They have some other equipment in there as well, but everything I just mentioned specifically fits into this tale. The first 5 blades in the primary m1000e are all dedicated to the ESX cluster, and hosts a lot of the more critical business servers, and the dev environment. In addition the first SAN array acts as the primary storage for ALL of the ESX data pools, and the CP cluster since the management server is virtual now.\n\nOne of the things I have been tasked with since coming back to lend a hand was racking, and configuring a new Equallogic PS6500 to migrate the last bit of the data off the legacy EMC array. As I said, this is a small company, so no rack-monkeys here. It was up to me once again! I started getting the rack all prepped last week, getting cables run, and making sure there were configured ports on the 10G switches for the new fiber lines. This morning I was going to put the rails so I could get the Equallogic in its new home, before finishing the cabling and starting the after hours work. As I also previously mentioned, it's been a few years since I did any work here so other IT guys have come and gone since and things changed, and grew. So now I got to work getting the rails into the rack, which happened to be an old APC rack (this is very relevant). As I started to put the firs of the two rails in I got the back in no problem, then walked around to get the front rail locked in. Got that bad boy in there. Once I had the rail locked in, I went to slide the rail in since it had become fully extended while I was getting it in the rack. As I slid it back I met a little resistance, but I have had the happen before so I continued to slide it all the way in, and *click*, it's in! I then went to do the last rail, and as I'm getting it into position I happen to look down and... **FUCK**, I saw red lights flashing on the front of the Equallogic under the one i was supposed to be racking, which just so happened to be the primary. So I took a moment, and went around to the back to see if I could see any indication as what was going on with it before I started walking back to my desk to log into it. I go around back, and that's when I saw the begging of my rookie mistake.\n\nThese Equallogic rails extend a good 4-5 inches out past the back of these APC racks, to where they cover the plugs to the PDU's mounted in them (one PDU on each side). Yeah, that little bit of resistance I felt earlier? That was the rail system pulling the power plugs out of the PDU for the primary array. Hey, not to worry, Equallogic's have three redundant PSU's! Well, accept for whoever was the last person to touch this had moved ALL three of the power cables over to the SAME PDU, and the SAME damn channel too! So now the primary Equallogic was offline. Along with that it took ESX, share drives, and some iSCSI connections to various servers. This is also when I found out that whoever was here last also never configure network fail over, and basically ANY of the redundancies you'd otherwise expect to see. So now my stomach is in my throat, and hey, I'm an IT vet, I kept my cool. . . HAH! I panicked, got everything plugged back in, and raced back to my desk to get on and see what was down/lost, and what needed to be done. Over the course of the next 45 min I was bringing back the ESX cloud, vShphere manager, firewall manager, and shares. This little mistake also uncovered some other things hiding away I had no knowledge of, like when vCenter is restarted is doesn't come back on its own. The management service soft locks, and you have to manually kill it, and force it to restart the service to get vCenter management back.\n\nAt last, things are finally back up, and I have been placing orders for spare gBICs, and PDU's, why? Because I found out the reason the Primary Equallogic was on the same PDU was because the bottom channels on the secondary PDU had died, and no one was ever made aware so it could be replaced. I don't know how long it sat like that before this morning. Now I'm thinking to myself I didn't have enough coffee this morning. \n\nHappy Monday!",

        "text": "*[Previously](https://redd.it/7cwkt6) [on TFTS…](https://redd.it/7d524l)*\n\n*The beleaguered aircraft visit has steadily deteriorated.  Our intrepid lead, ZeeWulfeh, has been fighting the good fight trying to plan around the mounting issues but between phone calls, emails and texts all demanding the same information repeatedly, the situation has turned for the worst.*\n\n*Everything that has gone wrong thus far:*\n\n*Notification of an AD a day before it takes effect—cannot use the thrust reversers until corrected\n\n*Seats delivered from modification with incorrect paperwork—cannot use them until corrected\n\n*Landing Gear system AD mod has incorrect paperwork—Cannot continue mod and therefore get power on aircraft until corrected\n\n*Self-inflicted galling of a hole in an engine pylon lead to reaming out to larger size…and failing to do so means either we get a repair from the manufacturer or we have to replace the whole pylon assembly\n\n*Administrative Note: At this point my notes have ended and I’m now reconstructing from memory and archived emails.*\n\n*Also, [Glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7e9iv1/more_from_aviation_maintenancemurphys_law_but/dq3d0zd/) at the bottom.*\n***\n&gt;**Inspector** “The hole is now 0.548 at the top”\n\nWe all stopped and stared.  Someone asked for a re-measurement.  \n\n\nIt was still bad.\n\n$LCE was notified and he put in a notice to $AircraftManufacturer requesting that maybe, somehow, perhaps they can tell us how to fix it without replacing the pylon.  I, meanwhile, inform management of the issue.  Back in my bay, I sit down with the leads and we start to hatch The Plan.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Hey, Wash, we’ve got a problem…”\n\nWash wasn’t actually any shade of Browncoat, nor did he ever squire, but this guy’s name sounds rather like it and he had a saying: “If It’s in the air, [Wash] put it there!”  That, and he’s a private pilot.  So, Wash for the purposes of this story.  I explain the issue to him and he immediately has a solution –He’ll take a team out to The Desert, they’ll mob a plane being retired and ~~steal~~ acquire a pylon off of that.  \n\n&gt;**Wash** “Oh yeah, it’ll be no problem, we took those things off all the time back in….”\n\nI wake up a few minutes later, oddly enough my forehead aching as if I suddenly lurched forward and slammed my head into the desk.\n***\n###Day 16\n\n$TRPE3 is waiting for me first thing in the morning.  I lead him over to the tech we’ve got working the thrust reversers and introduce them to one another.  That problem solved, I move on to the seats.  The modification supplier agrees to send someone to fix the seat documentation while the Interior Engineers fix their work cards to make sure it doesn’t happen again.  Two problems going down!  \n\n$AircraftManufacturer, meanwhile, responds to $LCE and tells us to just replace the pylon.  \n\nThat afternoon, I get another response from $AircraftManufacturer regarding the Landing Gear system and once $LGE interpreted it from EngineerSpeak to English…\n\n…what the?  I wake up again, face on the desk, as if I just slammed it against the hard surface.  I glance at my email and feel the urge to do so again.  \n\nIt seems that back in the 90’s when this aircraft was delivered to us, $AircraftManufacturer made an oopsie.  They told us it was a Mod-X version, but on reality, it turns out it was a Mod-Y.  The slight difference meant that we thought the system on this plane worked one way when in reality it had been working slightly differently for the past 20+ years. \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “$LGE, when do you think you’ll have me some paperwork?”\n\n&gt;**$LGE**  “Oh, I’m working hard on it, I’ll have a draft copy for you by the end of the day!”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Great, because I’m supposed to have power on today, and I can’t turn it on until you get me something and we get the work done.  Am I going to be able to use this ‘draft’ to finish the project?”\n\n&gt;**$LGE**  “Oh, yeah, uh, totally.”\n\nWith an answer like that I should have said something.  I did not, and later that afternoon I felt the email with the draft come in on my ~~leash~~ work phone and pulled over my car to forward it on to the guys doing the mod.  \n\nAnd proceed to set off another fecal-matter storm.  \n\n***\n###Day 19\n\nMonday, I come in to work, tail between my legs and apologizing.  Our Quality Control Inspection department had just spent the weekend wrapping their heads around and cleaning up the mess I’d created.  By forwarding a draft, and a *horrible* draft at that, I had released invalid paperwork to the floor, by which the mechanics had started work-to include drilling holes in the aircraft.  $LGE, meanwhile, had been told in no uncertain terms he would finish his paperwork before the end Day 17, Saturday.   Because of my screw-up with the paperwork, the Inspection Manager had to stay late on Friday and his junior manager was stuck in exceedingly late on Saturday and had to show up on Monday to report on just how badly I’d forked things up.  In hindsight, the posterior-reduction procedure I received was far less painful than I expected or deserved.\n\nThe correct paperwork delivered to the guys on the floor, I then got a hold of Wash.  Come to find out he and his team had spent the weekend in California waiting for a truck to show up with the pylon stand so they could remove it and put it in place for shipping.  They’d be back in a day or so, they pylon would arrive by the end of the week. \n\n\nManagement, however, isn’t happy with the replacement solution and requests $AircraftManufacturer to perform a Damage Tolerance Analysis.  $AircraftManufacturer replies  and lets us know that they’ll look at it, but frankly they’d never done a damage analysis for that area so it might be a week.  Oh, and we gotta pay for it. In the meantime, we were to drill it out to the first oversize past ½ inch, and then use the NDT5000 tool to determine there’s no other damage.  $LCE issues this revision of the PRI to the floor and the guys nail it this time, after of course doing a couple test reams.  \n\nOn the Thrust Reverser front, I learn they’d completed everything and it was down to close-up…after the application of a corrosion preventative compound.  Which I was informed by the engineer (who’d flown back to The Mothership over the weekend) we didn’t stock *anywhere* at all.  And since it’s an AD…\n\n\n...they would try to have it by next week.\n\n\n\nFinally, I look over the reports and….\n\n..OW!  There’s that desk again!\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Hey, $Lead, what’s this about a [flap](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fbcd87af848a31ce486d053da57b96f6) spigot pin?”\n\n&gt;**$Lead**  “Oh, yeah, that.  Inspection found the internal threads corroded”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “Okay, great, but, what is it?”  \n\n&gt;**$Lead ** “Ah, right.  That pin is what holds the flap [track](http://www.aerochapter.com/administrator/upload/image/07(2\\).jpg) to the wing.  We need to pull the whole flap off, and then remove the flap track to get the pin out.”\n\n\n*Admin Note: Please ignore the propeller on the picture.  That's the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) on an A330.  It provides emergency auxiliary hydraulic power in the case of a serious system failure.  The RAT on this aircraft is located elsewhere.*\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “How did they find out it was corroded, it’s still on the wing?”\n\n&gt;**$Lead**  “It’s the threads inside the pin.  The threads that you’d screw the puller into.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Wait.  We have to pull the flap off and the track and replace the pin because the threads you use to pull the pin are corroded?”\n\n&gt;**$Lead**  “Yup.”\n\n#*WHAM*\n\n\n*Edit: Added in photos of flap, statement about RAT*",

        "text": "I [wrote recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7d4kcq/telco_guy_wouldnt_it_be_funny_if_i_set_your_pbx/) about the techs from the telco that both supported the company PBX and were the local telco, and how I gave each one of them nicknames.  This is the story of the very last visit from one of them.\n\nA few years ago, it was finally time to kick that PBX to the curb.  We were replacing it, and also replacing the ridiculous bank of analog phone lines with a shiny new T1.  I had been working on the project for a long while, and had staged phones with the users, etc.  The switchover date was fast approaching.  Downtime was scheduled, customer alerts had gone out, users were prepared (and excited because they'd have external caller ID for the first time ever).  Cancellation orders were placed, etc, etc.\n\nFor $REASONS, telco delays the delivery of the T1 until very nearly the last possible minute.  (Those reasons may have had something to do with losing out on a 6-figure PBX upgrade and the lucrative service contract for it.)\n\nSo they dispatch Excuses Elaine to do the T1 install.  \"Excuses\" because she was always ridiculously late, or would leave before a job was completed.  She always had ridiculously phony excuses for this.\n\nSo Excuses Elaine arrives and the following conversation ensues:\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: I'm here to hook up the new T1.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Great.  Just tag the ports on the punch block you'll be using.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: Which punch block?\n\n&gt; **Me**: The telco block in the comms cabinet.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: Uh, I'm not installing it there.  I'm installing it in the men's room.  That's the demarc.\n\nA \"demarc\" is short for \"demarcation\".  The \"demarc\" is the spot where, on one side, the wiring is the telco responsibility, and on the other side, the wiring is the company responsibility.  So we were having a dispute about the demarc location.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Uh...  the men's room?\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: Yes.  All the phone wiring for the building goes through there.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Are you serious?\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: Yes.  Here, I'll show you.\n\nElaine leads me not to the office men's room I thought of, but out into the shop area of the building, rather far off, to a restroom I didn't even realize existed.  \n\nElaine barged in without knocking.  I followed, rather hesitantly, into the thankfully empty room.\n\nThe room wasn't just a restroom - it was also a small locker/shower room (that part of the building wasn't air conditioned, and a lot of folks worked with dirty equipment, so they could shower before going home there.)\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, in the corner by the sink was an ancient-looking metal box that had probably been installed during the Nixon administration.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: This is the demarc.\n\nElaine opened the box.  Some of the wires were losing bits of insulation.  The years of dust had solidified into caked-on dirt thanks to the humidity.  I felt that touching anything might cause half the phone lines in the company to short out.  It was completely unclear which wires proceeded inwards, or which went outside.\n\nAt this point, mild panic set in.  I'm a software guy.  I can figure my way around a multimeter, a punch tool, and a tone/probe set, but since I don't use those tools every day, I'm not the most proficient.  And I had no background knowledge on this entirely undocumented box, and a deadline pressing hard against me.  Elaine was going to announce \"use these wires\", then by the time I had it sorted out and saw tons of errors on the line, she'd be long gone....\n\nAnd I was starting to wonder if Elaine was right.  The location was such a stupid one for a demarc, that it was just plausible that it really was...\n\n&gt; **Me**: Uh, I've been here X years and the demarc has always been the comms cabinet.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: Look.  Company policy requires that I terminate the T1 right here in the men's room.  I can either do that or I can leave right now.  Your choice.\n\n*Panic intensifies*\n\n&gt; **Me**: The guy I talked to on the phone said the demarc was the comms cabinet.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**, now looking really pissed: Oh really?  And who told you that?  Was it Chuck?  'Cuz he doesn't know what he's doing.\n\n&gt; **Me**: No, it was Doug.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: Oh *muttered expletive*.  He's my boss.\n\nOH YES, that was a BEAUTIFUL sentence.  There was yet hope!\n\nDoug was the one really excellent contact I had at $TELCO.  I had never met him, but he knew his stuff technically and made things happen.  He gave me his direct line once, and I had it pinned up to my wall in a sort of \"in emergency, break glass.\"  I used it quite sparingly.  But I hadn't known he was a manager.\n\nThe rest of that trip to our site, Elaine kept muttering expletives JUST quiet enough that I couldn't quite make them out...\n\n&gt; **Me**, enthusiastically: Oh yes!  DOUG said you'll be installing it to the network cabinet.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: Well.  He's wrong.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Why don't you call Doug and clear this up?\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: I'm not allowed to call him for something silly like this.\n\n&gt; **Me**: Then I'll call him.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: I'm not allowed to give out his number.\n\n&gt; **Me**: I already have it.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: *muttered expletive*  Who gave it to you?  Was it Chuck?  I'll wring his neck if he gave out a secret number!\n\n&gt; **Me**: No, Doug gave it to me himself.  Let's go to my desk and put him on speaker.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: Oh *quiet expletive*.  OK then.\n\nWe go to my desk.  I make the call.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: .... and this customer insists that the demarc is in the comms cabinet, not the men's restroom.\n\n&gt; **Doug**: He's right.\n\n&gt; **Elaine**: But...\n\n&gt; **Doug**: Tag it in our punch block in the comms cabinet like always.  Make sure you tone &amp; probe it first.  Don't leave until he has a signal.\n\nBwahahaha.  Doug knew his employees well, clearly.  Elaine storms out in a huff.  I would have been laughing if the entire conversion wasn't in very real jeopardy at that moment.\n\nElaine spent the next hour or two trekking back and forth between the men's room and the comm cabinet, which happened to be right next to my desk.  She was not happy.\n\nBut, the line got up, the conversion was a success, and I never had a site visit from $TELCO techs again.\n\nI did, however, make the mistake of upgrading everybody's Reagan-era desk phones that were barely capable of tone dialing to shiny new digital phone with all sorts of features.  This resulted in a month of calls like this:\n\n&gt; **User**: Are the phones down?\n\n&gt; **Me**: Not that I'm aware of.  What's going on?\n\n&gt; **User**: Well, when $REMOTE_SALESMAN calls, my caller ID is broken.  It just says \"Missouri Call.\"\n\n&gt; **Me**: That's because that's all we get from cell phones.\n\n&gt; **User**: But my cell phone shows his name when he calls.\n\n&gt; **Me**: That's because you programmed it in.\n\n&gt; **User**: Well he's not even in Missouri this week.  The Caller ID is all broken!  This whole system is down!  I need working phones to do my job!\n\nArrggghhhhh....",

She'd bought some new books and they weren't appearing on her Kindle. I suggested we Skype on her laptop so that she's able to hold up the Kindle and I can see what's on the screen as I am unable to control it remotely.\n\nWe're on the call and I start with the usual and say that we need to check if there's a connection to the internet on her Kindle. The easiest way to do this for her would be to load Google and then type in something random and see if some pages appear. She did this and said it was fine.\n\nThen I asked her to swipe down from the top so the settings menu appear and I see her hand reach towards the camera. It took me a second to realise what she was doing. She had opened the web page on her laptop (that we were skyping through) to check if it had an internet connection and then tried swiping down across the (non-touch) laptop screen (with the camera at the top).\n\nAfter a little giggling I explained that she needed to do all that on the Kindle itself and we found there was no internet. After getting into the settings I got her to hold it up to the screen so I could see it and found that she'd somehow managed to turn Airplane mode on. Once that was off all her books started to appear and we had a laugh about her swiping down on the laptop.\n\nOther instances of amusing support requests are (and there are many more):\n\n * Why is there no white ink in the printer\n * Why is the printer not printing (it was switched off)\n * What is that weird flashing thing on the screen (it's your mouse cursor mom)\n",

        "text": "Greetings. It's gonna be short but - hopefully - fun.\n\nQuick preface: *I'm an undertaker. I get hired to be consulted to revive dead/dying projects if I can, otherwise I butcher the project and try to get paid for partial completion. All the while, I decide which heads will roll for the failure. I usually care about noone but the C levels.*\n\n*Quite some time ago I was the consultant for a large-scale digital archive/3D GIS project. I had left after they could receive progress payments in two consecutive months. It was a trainwreck in every single aspect but we could have done it.*\n\nI'll call myself $me because all the cool kids call themselves $me, then I'll call the project manager $IMP, shorthand for ~~idiot~~interesting project manager.\n\n&gt;**$me:** Hello. Zztri here.\n\n&gt;**$IPM** Zztri there? I am $IPM. I'm the new project manager for $project. We have a problem, your GIS tools suddenly stopped working.\n\n[Internally]No they did not suddenly stop working.[/Internally]\n\n&gt;**$me:** What changed on your side? Network, users, settings? Anything?\n\n&gt;**$IPM:** Absolutely nothing changed on our side.\n\nI started asking individual questions about what may have changed but he didn't budge. Nothing had had changed but my code had mysteriously stopped working. Great.\n\n&gt;**$IPM:** I'm going to demand free service from you, since it's your code that doesn't work.\n\n&gt;**$me:** Of course if you're confident the problem's at my side, let's make a deal. I'll ask for no money at all if it was my fault but if any change on your side caused that, you'll naturally pay for accommodations and my daily fee of $$$$$$$$$$$$. Acceptable?\n\n&gt;**$IPM:** Definitely. I ensure you nothing's changed on our side.\n\nYou possibly know what happened. When I got to their office, uh.. Seems they had moved offices a few days ago.\n\n&gt;**$me:** When did you move? Let me guess. Exactly before the problems have started, right?\n\n&gt;**$IPM:** But it shouldn't change anything. We use exactly the same network structure.\n\nI move over to one of the desktops and quickly type windows+R '\\\\\\\\&lt;NAS IP&gt;\\\\&lt;digital scan location&gt;'... It can't be found.\n\nI look back at $IPM.\n\n&gt;**$IPM:** Uh.. Those IPs have changed. &lt;customer&gt; asked us to use their DHCP so they could reach the local web reports you developed.\n\nI fire up &lt;well-known GIS application&gt; and get to my extension's settings page. I let out a sigh and change all the addresses, one by one, after asking for each.\n\n&gt;**$IPM:** But we didn't know these needed to be changed. I don't think we're supposed to pa..\n\n&gt;**$me:** I don't care. \"Nothing changed\" was your promise to me. Things have changed.\n\n&gt;**$IPM:** But it was such a simple solution. Perhaps you may give us a disco..\n\nI saw $blackbeard, the network admin of the customer whom I liked very much.\n\n&gt;**$me:** Blackbeard! What do I call the money I get paid for customer's failure?\n\n&gt;**$blackbeard:** Uh.. princess dress money?\n\n&gt;**$me:** No the other one, the name I explained you.\n\n&gt;**$blackbeard:** Uhm.. [actually in English]idiot tax[/actually in English]?\n\nI turn to $IPM and nod knowingly. I know he knows English.\n\n... Anyway.. It was a good amount for a single day's job. I'll heed to the advice given in this subreddit and will send $IPM the photos of several \"hatchimals\" collectibles I bought with his money. My daughters will be pleased.",

        "text": "Sometimes, though not often, I come across a person who really is challenged by technology. Noreen was one of those.\n\nA lady in her 80’s she had spent her working life first in an office then for more than 20 years teaching people in a business college to type and take shorthand. Noreen was a phenomenon, she still used pitman shorthand for her shopping lists. \n\nA “crafty” woman, she excelled at knitting, crochet, and tapestry work. Alas when it came to technology she had a problem.\n\nThe first challenge came when her old TV died; you see the new one came with a remote control. When it was unpacked and set up I first hear the phrase “MountainWombat you know that there are just too buttons!”\n\nI helped by pointing out that all you needed to use was just five of the buttons. The power button, channel up and down, and the sound up and down. Noreen was happy with this, but she asked if she only needed these five why where all the other buttons cluttering up the control?\n\nNext Noreen bought a microwave oven. Again there was “too many buttons”. She resolved this problem herself. Every time you pushed the “start” button it added another minute to the cooking timer.  \n\nThen Christmas came and a DVD as a gift. Fortunately it was the same brand as the TV and that meant only one control, but still there was too many buttons. This was easily solved by using whiteout to paint a circle around the two extra buttons that she used, video select, and the DVD “play” button\n\n It wasn’t for lack of interest, or of intelligence. Noreen saw technology as being unnecessarily complicated. She was right. A quick check in my lounge room found that I had a total of five remote controls. Even for someone as technically tragic as me this is way too many!\n\nNoreen was not afraid of new things, a mobile phone was next on the shopping list, and she had signed up to a computers for seniors training course in her local community center.\n\nAlas, this was not to be. Noreen, my mother in law passed away suddenly earlier this month.\n\nOne of my enduring memories of this wonderful lady was of her looking at me with a small smile turning up the corners of her mouth and a twinkle in her eye as she said “MountainWombat, there are just too many buttons!”\n",

        "text": "I'll preface this by saying I have only been working tech support for about 8 months now, and I am still learning about much of the actual technical resolutions to many issues, specifically relating to linux and how to use terminal and the like.  \n\nOur story today takes place at an unnamed educational institution. A client comes in with a surface pro belonging to their head of department and tells us that the owner has forgotten their password and there are some files that they would like so could we reset the password for us. \n\nOne of the techs who has been working here a bit longer than I decided that this was a good opportunity to show me how to reset a windows password using Linux on a USB. So we boot into linux after some difficulty and having to mess around in the BIOS to sort out boot orders and I search around a bit before finding the disk program, having learned all of 10 minutes earlier that Linux doesn't automatically mount disks.  \n\nThis was where we ran into the first problem. The disk wouldn't allow us to mount it. We tried a few other method before using gparted to check the disk, only to find that it had been encrypted with bitlocker.  \n\nBummer, we figured that was it and I called the client to let them know that we wouldn't be able to reset the password for them.\nWe decided to check the password at this point to see if we could guess it just for fun. After trying a blank password we notice the hint that the client as left. It was a simple math equation of which I will change the numbers for the story. Let's just say 5x3.   \n\nWe tried every single password we could think of relating to 15. Eventually our manager looks over and asks what we've tried so far. We start rattling off number and passwords and he asks:  \n\n&gt;\"Have you tried 555?\"  \n\nWell lo and behold we're in.  \n\nTrying not to laugh my arse off I called the client back and let them know that we had managed to get the password from their hint, and had a short discussion about password security.  \n\nAnyway that was the most difficult password reset I have seen so far with the most oddly dissatisfying resolution.  \n\n\nTL;DR  \n\nUser wants us to reset password on an encrypted disk, ends up with the best password hint/password combo in the world.

        "text": "I tried to post this once before but it never showed up.  Hopefully it will show up this time, as I think it's an appropriate time of year, before everyone gets bombarded with family tech support on their trips home for the various holidays...  \n\nI was inspired to write this story when I was going through some old voicemails and got surprised by one of them, then found an unused headset in a box.  I actually am a tech support professional, but this story is about family tech support…  \n\nLike so many here, I often get called by family to troubleshoot various things. For me it’s most often been my mom that gives me these calls.  For instance: she was getting taken by her ISP for about $10 a month for a wireless router, so I give her an old router I found in my closet.  This results in the usual calls about her wifi not working.  I always just grit my teeth, roll my eyes and tell her to unplug it and plug it back in, or remind her(again!) that the wifi password is my phone number.  \n\nThen she had a slight stroke.  It was nothing too major, but it affected her eyesight a little bit which made it hard for her to type very much.  This wouldn’t have been much of an issue, except she likes to write her brother in prison.  She’s heard of speech recognition software and asks me if I can find something that will help her out.  It turns out the leading software for this is pretty expensive, but Windows actually has some speech-to-text capability built-in.  I figured out how to turn it on, picked up a cheap microphone, and took a trip out to see her.  We find that you have to go through some exercises so it can learn your speech patterns, so I explain how to do it and leave her to it.  \n\nShe tries now and then to use the speech recognition but it turns out that a microphone sitting on the desk doesn’t work so well.  She asks for more help, but I really don’t have time to sit down and walk her through it.  Besides, if the microphone doesn’t work well, then there’s nothing I can do, right?  I actually do want to help though, so for Christmas I got her a headset microphone.  She seems to be excited, and better yet, she stops calling me about writing letters by talking!  \n\nSoon enough though, I find out why there’s been no calls about the headset:  she hasn’t been feeling well enough to try.  She’s in and out of the hospital a few times for a few minor things, they do some tests, and then finally we find out the reason for all the medical issues: cancer, and it’s bad.  The time after that is frankly a blur of nurses, medical terminology and emotions, and not particularly relevant to this story.  The end result is that she was given 8 weeks…she lasted 4.  \n\nSo then I got to clean out her apartment.  My tech support duties there are over.  I got the headset back, it never got taken out of the packaging.  I got the cheap microphone too, and I got my router back.  And I have a single voicemail saved.  It’s about 15 seconds long, and it’s just her asking for the wifi password so her neighbor can use her internet.  I rolled my eyes at that message when I first got it, and now I would like nothing more than to get another one.  \n\nI know the family tech support calls can be annoying, but you should enjoy them while you can.  I complained about them too, and now I will get no more tech support calls from mom. Instead I have some old equipment and a voicemail…and I would do anything to trade back.\n",

The setup for the rooms is: the cash desk where I am located, managers office that's 20  meters away, the smoke room and the main room.\n\nYesterday we got a new printer (cannon MF237w) and I was working shift with the assistant manager (not tech savy, not really relevant to the story) and we had to plug everythig in (power cable, usb cable which leads to the vga switch, phone cable and power) and call IT so they set it up remotely.\n\nYes, the cd with the drivers was included but we had no authority to do it ourselves.\n\nThere are 2 computers both in the manager's office and the cash desk. Both computers are connected to the coresponding vga switch to change  the display on the monitor from one to another. One has the management software and controllers for the slot machines and the second is for writing reports and doing currency exchange.\n\nSo then tech guy's work starts. He installs the drivers to the both non-slot_machine_controller_pc's and sends a test print, so far so good.\n\nHe calls us on the phone to tell us to try the scanner.\nThe scanner utility works on the cash desk pc and doesn't on the managers office pc because it's running xp and it simply won't scan neither by clicking scan on the scanner or the utility.\n\nThe idea was that for scanning the report we do the scan from the cash desk pc and then somehow transfer it to the manager's pc so I call the tech guy and tell him to create a shared folder on the network for easy transfer.\n\nAll is good.\n\nNow the drivers have to be installed to the 2 slot machine controller pc's and that is done by the IT from other country because only they have the admin rights.\n\nAfter they do their work the printer suddenly won't print anything.\n\n$tg = tech guy\n\n$me = me\n\n\n&gt;$me: hello $tg, after the other IT did their work on the controller pc's everything broke.\n\n&gt;$tg: what's the error message?\n\n&gt;$me: printer offline, but everything is connected and i've tried powercycling it, won't print.\n\n&gt;$tg: check the ipv4 config, turn autoaquire off on everything, check setting and call back\n\n&gt;$me:  ok, why don't you try to reinstall the drivers?\n\nHe remotes in, reinstalls the drivers, no bueno same error.\n\n&gt;$tg: hey, $me, can you unplug and plug back the ethernet cable on the printer.\n\nI turn the printer around, that small clickity thingy on ethernet cables is loose, moved the cable 2 mm's back and made the printer lose connection. Push it back in, printer starts printing everything from the que.\n\n&gt;$me: hey $tg about the cable....\n\n&gt;$tg: let's pretend that never happened kkthxbye\n\n&gt;$me: k thx bye\n\nTl:dr: cable is loose, tech guy spent 45 minutes troubleshooting.\n",

I was clicking on each file and deleting it individually\"\n\nI then went and showed her how to select and delete everything. Now, it took about 5 minutes of processing. I then realised that there was one file left. Stacked on another file. Stacked on another. Hmm... The job may not be finished quite yet. I ungrouped that stack. The desktop was full again. Repeat the process three times. Boom. We did this Jenny.\n\nNow the conversation went like this: \n\n\n\"Jenny, why would you keep so many files on your desktop?\" \n\n\n\"When I started this job I was told to save everything\" \n\n\n\"That's great, but the aim of saving a file is to be able to quickly access it for reference if needed. Did you ever try to find any random file Jenny?\" \n\n\n\"No\"\n\n\n\nI then took her to my computer to show her the basics of folder structure, file naming methods etc. Will she implement any of it?

Our boss. A stand up guy.\n\n**$M** - My colleague. Working part time because $BIGBOSS asked not to leave $ORG.\n\n**$K** - Me.\n\n**16th 4PM** - $ITDEP just chilling around as it is 1 hour till the work day will end and our $BOSS is on vocation. It will be a longer weekend as we have 3 day holidays this weekend.\nSuddenly a phone call. $BIGBOSS is coming to $ITDEP. So we start to improvise some work. To give us more time $M steps out to see what $BIGBOSS is up to.\n\n&gt; A bit more about $BIGBOSS. Not a stand up guy. Makes more problems than deals with them. All has to be about him. A sociopath. If he needs something, he just asks. He doesn't care how you will get it done. Has 0 patience. He is not afraid to yell at you in front of anyone. He is not afraid to call somebody an idiot. He basically gets away with everything. He has been with $ORG for many years and this is how he has always been.\n\nBack to the story. $BIGBOSS is a bit of a chess nut. All he does in his spare time (and work time or any time he is not drinking himself in to an early grave) is play/watch/analyze chess. The problem is $CHESSFED needs $ITDEP help on setting up a chess tournament. As we have done it before, all the responsibilities to do this, is on our heads. So the tournament starts on Friday the 17th 6:30PM. We - $M and $K, have to be where the tournament starts at 2PM to set everything up. This is considered a favour for $BIGBOSS\n\n**17th 8:30AM** My work day starts, so we start to set up the chess software. There are more than a 100 participants. We need to enter them by hand. (It's stored in json and is just time consuming). We enter all the participants, set up their ratings, teams and country they are representing. We set up the FTP server in the previous tournament so we will use the same one. We just cleared the old data, so the new data can come in.\n\n**17th 2PM** We arrive at the tournament place. We need to set up a projector and a screen so all the games can be viewed on the spot. There are 20 chess boards which all connect with a COM port and ethernet cables. There is a COM to USB at the start of our connection line which is plugged in to the PC, so we can see how many boards are connected and if they recieve the information on all the moves players make.\n\n**17th 4PM** Work day is over for everyone in the $ORG because it's a day before national holiday. We are still working to set up the tournament. We have connected all the boards, the data is coming to our FTP server. The only thing we can't set up are the matchups. Before every chess tournament there is a draw of who plays who. So we don't know it. And there is no reason for us to stay as we taught couple of $CHESSGUYS how to set up matchups and where the START TOURNAMENT button is.\n\n**17th 4:30PM** We have set everything up. We left our mobile numbers so they can call us if anything is not working. The PC has Teamviewer, so we can remotley fix the problem.\n\n**17th 9PM** $M sends $K a message that the $BIGBOSS or $CHESSGUYS haven't called so it should be fine.\n\n**18th** HAPPY NATIONAL HOLIDAY!!!\n\n**19th 1PM** $M sends $K a message that he has been let go from the $ORG by $BIGBOSS. $K actually thought $M was joking around. However $M send $K the message that the $BIGBOSS sent $M how he can't work part time anymore. So $M is leaving $ORG. I asked $M what did go wrong. $M explained me that the $CHESSGUYS didn't set up the matchups, so there was no LIVE STREAM of the event. $BIGBOSS was so pissed that he lost his game that he blames $M for fucking up the LIVE STREAM. \n\n$M is the one and only administrator of each and every web page $ORG has.\n\nI have heard nothing on my behalf. \n\n**19th 8PM** I have applied for 4 job applications.\n\n**20th 10PM** I have edited all this story so it should be more clear now.\n\nIf you wonder if there is a BIGGER BOSS - Yes. Can he do anything? No. Why? Because the power of $BIGBOSS and working for MANY years in the $ORG as $BIGBOSS has so much intel and dirt that it is easier to just let it go.\n\n**21st 9AM** $M is in the office. He has entered his official resignation. Things are happening. Turns out that the $BIGBOSS has called more people and we start to figure out what happened with the tournament. $BIGBOSS is searching for $BOSS who is on a vocation and is not in the country. \n\n**21st 10AM** $M has been called to $BIGBOSS office. $BIGBOSS has asked some other people from $ORG to ask $M to stay with $ORG.\n\n**END** $BIGBOSS asked if he can turn the time back and asked $M to stay. $M said it is not possible so he is leaving us. Tomorrow is his last day.\n\n**UPDATE** I am also leaving my job here at $ORG. Just got a better offer.",

        "text": "Hello again TFTS. \n\nCharacters:  \n$me - average retail worker who gets thrust with the role of tech support because I once programmed my DVR to record Suits each week for a season.  \n$paddy - my boss. **very** irish. It will help if you imaging him wearing a green top hat dancing a jig.  \n\nWe'd just recently changed our website hosting. So for a short time we dropped off the Google search results while DNSs and other acronyms propagated. Or something. Anyway, I'd explained to $paddy to just keep checking Google for our main search term every few days and we'd eventually get there. I suggested that he bookmark the search so it's easier for him to quickly check.  \n\nCut to - my day of furiously putting stickers on boxes being interrupted by the fury of an irish braveheart on the phone to our (cheap, offshore) SEO company.  \n\n$paddy : ... it's been 4 fookin (note, he didn't actually swear, I just want to get you reading this in an irish voice in your head) weeks, t' be sure, and we're not anywhere on the front page  \n$paddy : ... Stop actin' the maggot, I'm lookin at it right now and we're not on there  \n$paddy : ... I don't care what your computer says. The way I see it, I've been payin you eejits to bunk off the last month!  \n*this continued for a while with all kinds of threats being made*  \n$paddy : ... ok, I guess that's acceptable. Now you lot crack on with is and see that ya don't make a bags of it.  \n$paddy : *hangs up*  \n$me : what was that about $paddy?  \n$paddy : these dossers have been at it for a month but we're nowhere to be seen on the google. So I got into them and they've promised to get it done, and they've given us a credit for 3 months fee  \n$me : *opens chrome and searches our primary keywords* there we are, number 2  \n$paddy : I was just looking and we weren't there, look *opens minimised chrome window and points: we weren't there*  \n$me : *looks at address bar* How did you get to these results $paddy?  \n$paddy : I bookmarked it to the desktop like you suggested, see. *points to icon on desktop - 'potato.html', sitting next to folder 'potato_files'*  \n$me : how did you make that bookmark out of curiosity?  \n$paddy : like this. *chrome -&gt; 3 dots -&gt; more tools -&gt; save page as...*  \n$me : ok. Good news bad news. Good news: we've probably been up high on google for a while now, plus you just scored 3 months of free SEO. Bad news: you just ate the head off our account manager for no reason and should probably apologise.  \n\nSo $paddy had been looking at the same static html copy of the search results from the day after our old website was knocked off. If our account manager at $SEO_company is on here, I'm sorry. \n\ntldr : no amount of SEO can change where you rank on a saved copy of a google search result page\n\nSP\n\nedit : Formatting (I'll get it first time one day)",

        "text": "This will be a quick one that jusy happened to me today. So I work as a cable technician installing/upgrading/fixing service. \n\nSo I am at a job and I was to upgrade their tv boxes and add phone service. I finish everything and while I am teaching them how to use the new equipment the customer says, \"This is great, but can you make sure my internet is actually working, because it wasn't before.\" So I quickly connect to the wifi using WPS and test it out and everything is good, but customer says her computer still doesnt work.\n\nHer computer was hardwired to the modem and when I open her browser (internet explorer...sigh) the msn homepage would load, but if you tried to go to ANY page you would get certificate errors and it would not let you get to any page.\n\nI start troubleshooting(aka google). First hotfix that came up was to go into internet options and disable the certificate  security check boxes and fiddle around with some settings which I tried, but no dice. After awhile I decide screw it IE sucks anways I'll just install chrome. There is only one problem, I can get to google and click on download google chrome, but the download pop up gives the certificate error so it wont download. I get visibly annoyed by this (btw im doing all this standing up hovering over the computer).\n\nNext solution says that if you computer lost power or anything it might have reverted to a past date which causes certificate errors. I look at the task bar and see, \"March 3rd 2008 6:43pm\" none of which was correct and a few cuss words are mumbled by me. I had to manually fix the time and then everything was working fine. Customer was estatic and I left.\n\nPost this on mobile on my way home sorry for any typos.\n\nTLDR: Every webpage says certifcate is invalid because they have current dated certificates and the computer thinks its 2008.",

        "text": "**Quick background reminder**: I'm a subcontracted employee of a small IT firm, working on a team that provided support for a major software firm's Big Software Suite ($BSS), focused on providing said support to \"IT admins' of small businesses (between 1 and 250 seats).\n\nThese \"admins\" range in tech-savvy from \"I need you to help us configure the PowerShell script we developed to copy everyone from **here** to **there**\" all the way down to \"so... I click on this (*hovers over button that says \"Install $BSS\"*)... then what do I do after that to install $BSS?\"\n\nWe have a small team that is currently in a growth spurt: we moved from southern Saratoga County (and a cramped, unused NOC with 20 makeshift desks) to a new facility on the border of a town and a (very small) city in Albany County, and a new call center environment with roughly 200 desks (and only 30 or so techs, 10 of which are brand new).\n\nWhat keeps me sane is that I have a very absurdist sense of humor, which helps to deal with some of the... er... more [special admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6p8xh6/the_ouroboros_installation/).\n\nSo far, most of it has been mundane.\n\nThis past week, though...\n\nI got a call from a profane admin ($PA) who was having some issues with our $BSS.\n\n(Setting variable: puppy = $PA.getProfanity().)\n\n&gt;$PA: I have 5 people coming this week, and I can't set up their email. The autodiscover keeps puppying up.\n\n(For the uninitiated, \"autodiscover\" is what allows you to set up $BSS's email client to $BSS email exchange. Without it, the email client can't see that it's in the $BSS exchange at all. so it sits. spins, takes your password, and does nothing.)\n\n&gt;Me: Well, I apologize that it's happening to you. Let's get this fixed as soon as we can.\n\nWe set up a remote session, and I see the setup choke and die.\n\n&gt;$PA: I can't stay on the phone too long... someone else puppied something else up, so I have to take care of that soon.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay. Let's rule some things out.\n\nI set up a profile in my client using a test account, and it works flawlessly. I'm on the same version of the client, so...\n\n&gt;Me: It's not an update.\n\nThere's a minor service degradation involving $BSS sharing website tech... but it has nothing to do with email, so...\n\n&gt;Me: It;'s not the system.\n\n&gt;$PA: I could have puppying told you that. We're all getting emails.\n\n&gt;Me: Right. Just had to check. Could you run a connectivity trace for the client, using this tool? *send link to admin*\n\n&gt;$PA: Okay. I'd do that, and send the results. I have to go and fix this puppy-up.\n\nWe signed off, and I waited to get the screenshots.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd... waited.\n\nTwo days later:\n\n&gt;Email from $PA: Here's a screenshot of the trace. It's still broken. Fix it.\n\nEven if he's a bit terse... I like this guy. He's a no-toro-manure kind of guy.\n\nI look over the trace. Everything is green. There's no sign of oddity.\n\nI grab a coworker who is much better at finding these things than I am (even if I am still learning, I have a ways to go before I have the level of knowledge many of my coworkers have... I'm at the top-middle, if what I hear from my boss is correct).\n\n&gt;$CW: Okay... yeah, they have a configuration panel ($CP) issue. *points to line of code in the trace*\n\nRight. Sounds like a quick fix.\n\n(For the uninitiated, $CP is a quick and dirty way of setting stuff up in your domain to handle DNS, email connectivity, etc.\n\nIt's also the current Gremlin of the Month in our team, as we have all had an autodiscover ticket which involved $CP, as no one sets it up right for the $BSS client.)\n\n&gt;Email to $PA: There's a $CP setting that needs to be done to fix this.\n\n&gt;Email from $PA: We don't use $CP. Call me.\n\n...huh?\n\nI tried to call $PA five times over the course of the day. I got his voicemail every time.\n\nMust have been some pretty crazy puppy-ups on those two days.\n\nMeanwhile, $CW showed me how to find that $CP (domain . com/$CP... very well hidden, right?), and sure enough, there it was.\n\nOnly... not only wasn't it supposed to be there, according to $PA, but their DNS host **doesn't use it at all**. It's right in their web page.\n\nDNS host 1 ($D1) is telling $PA he doesn't have $CP on his DNS. The $CP is actually coming from DNS host 2 ($D2) for no apparent reason.\n\nI finally get on the phone with $PA, set up another remote session, and show him where the $CP is.\n\n&gt;$PA: What the puppy...?\n\nHe tried to sign in using $D1 credentials. No joy.\n\n&gt;$PA: If it's not them, where is it coming from?\n\nI pointed to the info icon in the browser.\n\n&gt;Me: Let's find out.\n\nSure enough, the $CP was administered by $D2.\n\nSo, he logs in using $D2 credentials. Their website is hosted here, so they have an account.\n\n&gt;$PA: There should be no DNS rec... what the puppy?\n\nThere's a second set of DNS records here. MX... CNAME... the whole 9 yards. Everything is a duplicate of the DNS records set up on $D1.\n\n&gt;$PA: I know what happened.\n\nHe proceeded to scorch the earth under these records so the conflict was eradicated.\n\n&gt;$PA: Some guy in Marketing...\n\n(Case closed. Time to close ticket.)\n\n&gt;$PA: ...tried to... \"help\"... and he puppied everything up.\n\n&gt;Me: So...\n\n&gt;$PA: we'll wait 12 hours for the DNS to propagate, then I'll test and email you back.\n\nSo, the next day, I check my tools, and the DNS looks right. However...\n\n&gt;$PA: Autodiscover is still broken. Call me.\n\nI got $CW over, we called $PA, and we ran the connectivity test again.\n\n&gt;$CW: Right there. They still have a $CP error.\n\n&gt;$PA: We need the $CP for the website. We can't get rid of it.\n\n&gt;Me: It's what is screwing with your autodiscover. Let me show you the setting...\n\nI walked him down the page to the setting, we hit the proper radio button, test setup on a client.\n\n&gt;$PA: Holy puppy, that worked.\n\nI sit back and let him test on a few more accounts and clients. Meanwhile, he explains what happened.\n\n&gt;$PA: See, there was an issue with the website. A marketing guy...\n\n(It's always a marketing guy. Or sales. Case cl---)\n\n&gt;$PA: ...called $D2 to fix it, and the tech there said, \"Hey, your DNS is slow. Let me speed it up for you.\"\n\n(*record scratch* It **wasn't** marketing?!? What the puppy!)\n\n&gt;Me: Wow. Okay. Let's close this ticket and have a good weekend!\n\nTL;DR: Puppies. Puppies everywhere.",

        "text": "So, another tale from the memory banks. For clarity, I am a retail worker that just happens to know how technology more advanced than a toaster works, thus I am IT God of the store and do everything for anything with a screen.\n\n$sp = me\n$cw = coworker - Not tech-savvy, but thus far had not proved to be a complete muppet\n\nSo, I was on the first few days of a fortnight off. I was staying at a unit on a nearby island. Everything about this location was ideal but for one fact: the phone reception. It was not bad enough that I was unreachable (which would have been ideal), but not good enough for me to get a reliable data connection, and usually to sustain a lossless phone call, I would need to stand at the very extremity of the deck. \n\nAt work, we had recently-ish made some changes to our systems. We had opened a satellite location ($sat) for servicing one specific $client. $sat was unmanned on weekends, but $client needed minimal services on Saturdays that didn't financially justify physical staffing. For reasons, (both stupid and not), all business for $client needed to be done on $sat's computer system. Our solution was to RDP into $sat from our Main Location ($main) and perform the work remotely.\n\nJump to holidays:\n\nPhone rings:\n\n$cw : *noise* - *no noise* - *noise*  \n$me : wait, I have to go outside to get reception  \n$cw : ...not working  \n$me : start again.  \n$cw : $sat computers aren't printing to the label printer at $main (aside : because $sat and $main use different label stock, there was a dedicated label printer at $main loaded with $sat labels, which was a local printer on the VPN host machine)  \n$me (internal) : fuck  \n(there are like 4 distinct issues that I'd dealt with that all resulted in printers not working:  \n\n* 0 - VPN not connected - resolution : connect VPN  \n* 1 - innocent windows-up  - resolution : restart one or both computers  \n* 2 - not-so-innocent windows-up making computer think that printer isn't connected despite 0 and 1 being attempted - resolution : remove and reinstall printers  \n* 3 - evil ghosts - resolution - remove and reset VPN (only happened once) from stratch OR burn down store and claim insurance.)  \n\n$me : OK, I'll start from the start. Is the printer plugged in?  \n$cw : yes  \n$me : with both the power and usb cable?  \n$cw : yes.  \n$me : and the power is on?  \n$cw : yes. Pressing the feed button makes a label come out.  \n$me : on the $main computer's 'Devices and Printers', is the $sat_printer icon solid, or is it light/greyed out  \n$cw : solid  \n$me : ok, *tech support intensifies*  \n\nlong story short, due to abysmal mobile reception, I couldn't remote login to $main to do anything myself, so I had to step $cw through (without being able to see screens) : \n\n- rebooting $main machine  \n- rebooting $sat machine using cmd (\"if you forget the /r everything will be broken and I can't help you\")  \n- attempts at checking printer connections which lead to :  \n- walking through the process of manually removing and reinstalling the printer from the $sat computer\n\nThis took 75 minutes. Standing on the deck in the beating sun. I got sunburnt. \n\nAfter all of that, nothing worked. Still no printer connection. I was going to have to walk through, with no visual of the screen, deleting and resetting the VPN. Kill me. \n\n$me : This isn't good. The fix that I have to try now is more difficult then everything else we've tried thus far. I really don't want to have to do this, but I don't think there is any other way.  \n$cw : uh oh.  \n$me : yeah. look, before I start this, I am going to check some dumb stuff one more time in the hope I missed something.  \n$me : is the light on the feed button on? and does pressing it make a label spit out?  \n$cw : yes and yes  \n$me : is the usb cable connected?  \n$cw : yes. Oh, wait, does it need to be connected at both ends?  \n$me : please tell me you're fucking kidding  \n$cw : oh, someone has plugged in a USB drive to the port that the printer was connected to. I'll try plugging it back in.  \n$printer : *noise of 30+ test labels printing out in one go*  \n$me : didn't you say that on the $main computer, the icon for $sat_printer was solid/not greyed out  \n$cw : yeah, oh WOW, its like, darker again. It looks the same as the other ones in the folder now!  \n$me : *swears internally*  \n$me : if you know who's USB that is, don't tell me. If I get a call in the next fortnight about anything less than a crypto locking our system while the server slowly burns into a pile of slag, I will hang up, or kill you, or both  \n$cw : OKTHXBYE!!!!  \n\nI got hold of the USB key on my return and attached it to the bench in the break room with a note:  \n\"I don't know who's this is, and I don't want to. You wasted 2 hours of my holidays because you unplugged a printer to use it. Do not do this again\"\n\ntl;dr: \nPrinter not working. Assumed that coworker knew that both ends of a USB cable needed to be plugged in. Further assumed that coworker could make out differences in shading of pictures that are right next to others on the screen. Got sunburnt and wasted two hours trying every other printer troubleshooting until loose cable end was noticed, plugged in, and issue resolved. \n\nEdit (s) : formatting",

        "text": "Background, I'm an intern at local hospital and from time to time I help out the technicians with tickets. (They aren't judged on the amount of tickets closed or time to resolve so they don't mind if we take tickets.)  Also, long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nBack in mid August; I grabbed a ticket that had to do with securing and backing up data from someone who had just left our company. (They left on very good turns and is still good friends with my higher ups. ) So the policy we have is that their manager and Dept. Head get an archive copy of their emails in a PST file. They also get a copy of the Documents folder and anything we (IT) might see that is relevant to the company and that department projects. (Some users like to work fully from their desktop folder...)\n\n Before the user left, they copied all their personal data that they wanted to copy onto a flash drive. Or so they thought. Anyway, I finish up transfer all the data around, shut the laptop down and lock the office on my way out. \n\nFlash forward to beginning of October. Ex-User calls one of my managers and asks about a certain power point they were working on while employed here that they need for a very important upcoming meeting. In addition they don't have any of their personal data that they copied over. So, the manager asks if I can go do this person a favor since I was the one to handle their leaving.\n\n I gather information about what this power point should have in it and I head back to the locked office. Open the office, boot the laptop back up and scan the drive for any power point files. Then I also check for any of the keywords that should be in the file. Nothing. I even check all the backup files dating three months prior to them leaving,, nothing. Can't find this power point,  but the user insists it exists.  I get them calmed down about the power point and see about finding their other data. \n\nWe come to find that because our Security blocks unknown USB drives,  the user took all their personal data from the encrypted laptop drive and put it onto an unencrypted backup drive. Big whoops. (The program we use for back ups encrypts the files themselves so we don't have to have the whole drive encrypted.) I get the user an authorized flash drive and copy their data onto it for them to take home. I also moved all their data back onto the encrypted drive. \n\nApologized for not being able to find the power point and secured the equipment again. Flash forward a week or so and I get called into my one managers office, he asks me about the ticket and data recovery and if I remember it. He goes on to explain that the ex-user called him and told him that the file never actually existed... -_- \n\nI wasted 3 hours that day search through files and folders and archives of back ups.\n\nTL;DR. Ex-user who is very good friends with my bosses thought they left an important file on their old PC. I spend 3 hours of my work day hunting for the file. Turns out it never existed. \n\n\n",

        "text": "​Hey everyone, first post on TFTS...It’s been a couple of months since this happened, but I still get upset when I think about it\n\nCast:\n\n$Me: Small MSP Consultant/Support guy, field tech, level1/2/3 remote support person, sort of second-in-command, general all-rounder, king of andals, the rhoynar and the first men… you get the idea\n\n$Minion:Recent uni graduate (business informatics or something) we hired as on-site support for $Client. $Client is in another state and we have no presence there, so we hired him as a stopgap measure while we look for someone permanent. Remote support wasn’t cutting it anymore. He’s tech-savvy but doesn’t know much about IT infrastructure\n\n$OfficeAdmin: Our contact for $Client, OK guy but quite whiny. Goes into panic mode if he sees so much as a “Windows finished installing updates” pop-up on his desktop\n\n\nSo there I am, enjoying my morning coffee on an unusually quiet Monday, browsing reddit and generally trying to wake up…when I receive the following ticket from $Client:\n\n“Printer’s scan-to-email function stopped working, halp!”\n\nWell, there goes my quiet morning…I contact $OfficeAdmin to find out more:\n\n$Me: Hey $OfficeAdmin, what’s cookin’?\n\n$OfficeAdmin: Mate this printer’s scan function failed again, we’re not receiving the scanned documents! $Minion had a look but he couldn't fix it! UGH! Can you please help?\n\n$Me: Suuure, before I start troubleshooting, has anything changed in the office recently?\n\n$OfficeAdmin: Yeah, actually we had a new formatter installed in our MFP by our $PrinterServiceCompany. Come to think of it, scanning stopped just about the same time the tech installed the upgrade.\n\n$Me: Well, sounds like this might have something to do with the upgrade…\n\n$OfficeAdmin: I contacted their support already, they’re saying this must have something to do with you as everything else seems to be working fine. They think you need to check the network or something\n\n$Me: Well OK then, I’ll have a look and let you know.\n\nSo I remote into my server room PC to have a look at this printer’s web interface. IP is correct, I get in immediately. Check the SMTP server settings, all good. However, when I test the settings using the test button, I get the following error: “SMTP Gateway access failed”\n\n“OK” I think to myself, “since I was able to ping it and log in using the printer’s static IP, I will assume the rest of the network settings are correct as well. Let’s check access to the SMTP server itself”. We had SMTP server issues with this printer before, so this was actually plausible. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have assumed anything, but I expected the printer tech installing the hardware to be at least semi-competent at his job. Boy was I wrong…\n\nSo I spend the next 30 minutes testing access to the SMTP server from different computers and networks, thinking that there is something wrong there. Nope, all is well. So how come the printer can’t access it?\n\nI spend another 30 minutes going through O365 Exchange ($Client’s chosen cloud service) checking the mail flow, printer connectors etc. No problems there either. What’s going on?\n\nNow that I’ve exhausted all other possible explanations, I turn my attention back to the printer. I try to login to the advanced admin page to check the rest of the network settings…that’s where I get the first surprise: our admin credentials are not working! It’s an HP MFP, so I can’t even view the network settings (let alone change them) without the advanced admin password for JetDirect. I call $Minion in frustration:\n\n$Me: Hey $Minion, this #$%#$&amp;% HP printer won’t allow me to view the network settings remotely, are you able to physically print a network report and send me pictures of the fields?”\n\n$Minion: Sure, give me a minute.\n\n$Minion sends the pictures of the printed network report. I start checking the fields:\n\nFirst line is IP and subnet, 192.168.xx.xx\n\n$Me: OK here is the IP, all good as expected…\n\nAfter that is the DNS. Hmm…10.xxx.xx.xx\n\n$Me: Eh, this DNS is wrong. Of course the bloody scan-to-email didn’t work. What IP is this?\n\nAnd lastly, the domain…\n\n$Me: Ok, here is the $Client’s AD domain informa—wait, what?\n\nI’m not even going to mention at this point that $Client didn’t have an AD domain. You probably guessed that already. The question is, how the hell did this printer even get the completelyunrelatedcompany.com domain setting? I can imagine the printer tech accidentally entering a wrong DNS, but domain info?\n\nAt this point, I have my suspicions but I call $Minion to confirm before I contact $OfficeAdmin:\n\n$Me: Hi $Minion, were you there when the printer tech added the formatter to the MFP?\n\n$Minion: Yes, I was.\n\n$Me: Do you remember the process?\n\n$Minion: Yeah, I think the tech replaced the MFP’s motherboard or something?\n\n*Of course*. The penny finally drops. Cursing the incompetence of the printer company, I contact $OfficeAdmin:\n\n$OfficeAdmin: Did you find what the issue is?\n\n$Me: I think so. Did you buy used parts for your printer upgrade?\n\n$OfficeAdmin: Yes, we didn't have time to wait for a brand new replacement part. Why?\n\n$Me: *(Sigh, why didn't you mention this before?)* Well, that's the problem: your printer support company upgraded your printer with a second-hand motherboard but didn’t even bother to test everything. Configuration was all wrong, some of it was from the previous owner.\n\n$OfficeAdmin: WHAT?? I’m gonna tear those #$%$%#@!@ a new one! Can you fix it?\n\n$Me: Sure, but we have to return the printer back to factory defaults and configure from scratch.\n\n$OfficeAdmin: That’s OK, I’ll leave you to it. Thanks mate, I really appreciate your help.\n\nI contact $Minion next to enlist his help with the printer reconfiguration..\n\n$Minion: Hey mate, how can I help *(I can hear the $OfficeAdmin going ballistic on another call in the background)*\n\n$Me: Alright, we know what the issue is. DNS and domain settings were all wrong. I’m gonna need your help to set the printer up from scratch. Once the printer is reset, I’ll guide you through the reconfiguration.\n\n$Minion: Sure, no problem…but what’s a DNS?\n\n$Me: *(Oh, this is gonna be fun…)*\n\n\nTHE END",

        "text": "This was the last issue I dealt with today.  \n\nOne of my users reported to me that she heard more than one loud pop under a nearby desk and smelled a strong electrical/burning odor in the air. I go to investigate. The smell gets strongest by one particular power strip. I unplug it and start to remove it to take a look at it, and it, along with the bit of carpet it's sitting on, feels wet. My first thought: \"Thank $deity I unplugged this thing before touching it!\" My second thought: \"Ugh, I just put my hand in mouse piss!\" (We have occasional rodent issues in the building.) Fortunately, I was wrong.  \n\nTurns out, there was a plant on the desk that had been overwatered, and leaked. The plant was several feet away from the power strip, but the water ran to the back of the desk and then flowed horizontally for a respectable distance along the bottom of the desk's plastic edge trim, until it encountered the power cord of a monitor. It then flowed down the power cord and right into the power strip, causing a short circuit. Some straight up Final Destination type stuff.  \n\nI dumped out a decent amount of water from the power strip before throwing it out and replacing it. Luckily, neither monitor that was plugged into the power strip appears to have been damaged.  ",

        "text": "And so we have our main characters below:\n\n$me - The main character of story\n$TNSVV - The not so VIP, VIP \n$Unknown - I don't know what is job is. But he's important, I think. I still don't know. \n\nIt was one of those days in the office. An outage had occurred with the Exchange servers. It was widespread, not very consistent (would affect one person, but not their neighbor in the next cubicle) and in general very hard to identify compared to the other standard Outlook/Exchange problems.\n\nAs I had processed what was probably my 15th ticket on the case, I get a very curious ticket. It was put in by the IT Assistant on site.\n\n\nTitle : Cannot login to Outlook \n\nDescription: $TNSVV cannot login to outlook. Loading profile....\n\n\n\nI curse my lot in life and proceed to dial $TNSVV's number.\n\n&gt; $me : Hi this is, $me from the Service Desk. I'm calling in about a ticket that was just put in and I'd like to confirm a few things moving forward. \n\n&gt; $TNSVV : Uhmm... Isn't the information on the ticket enough? \n\n(internal sigh, it's gonna be one those cases...)\n\n&gt; $me: Unfortunately no, we actually do need to see if any troubleshooting has been done as well as check your connection to the Outlook Web App. There's an outage going on right now and that's one of the few things that'll help narrow this down. \n\n&gt; $TNSVV : Sure (I would describe the tone as... Standoffish). What do you need exactly?\n\n&gt; $me: Okay, can you let me know if any troubleshooting was attempted? Do you know if the agent did a profile reset? Start in safe mode? \n\n&gt; $TNSVV: No, I wasn't paying attention.\n\n(That line, becomes a recurring theme)\n\n&gt; $me: Hmm, okay. If that's the case, let me run through the standard suite first. \n\n(Once remoted in) \n\n&gt; $me: Okay, let's check one more time just to confirm the error we're working with.... And there I see it, Loading profile... Now let's try running it in Safe Mode. \n\n(Ctrl+click)\n\n&gt; $me: Hmmm, looks like it started up here. Just play around with it, let me know if everything is working here. \n\n&gt; $TNSVV: Okay.\n\n(Does some clicking around)\n\n&gt; $TNSVV: It doesn't seem like my emails are loaded up correctly. My phone says that I received an email an hour ago but it's not here. \n\n&gt; $me: I think I see what's causing that as well. Outlook says it is disconnected on the bottom right. This matches up with the cases we've had rec....\n\n&gt; $TNSVV : No this has been ongoing for the past month. \n\n(Jaw drop and face palm) \n\n&gt; $me : I'm sorry, if I head that correctly. This has been going on for the past month? \n\n&gt; $TNSVV: Yes. This has been ongoing. This is not part of the outage. \n\n&gt; $me: That's going to make things a little harder then. This definitely matches up with the other cases for the outage but I'll see what I can do for you. \n\n&gt; $TNSVV : Yes you will. \n\n (Insert swearing) \n\n&gt; $me : Okay, let's create a new .ost file first. That shouldn't mess with your current settings and delegated mailboxes and it'll help us see if Outlook can recreate your files. \n\nHaving created the .ost. Outlook starts up just fine, but with a caveat. The .ost file doesn't go pass 300 KB.  \n\n&gt; $me : Let's just monitor this for now, it might take time to recreate the data file. I'm available on Communicator, just give me a message in 10 minutes. I'll call you back and we'll check if this does anything.\n\nI document the ticket. Place it on pending and go through to the next one. In this time, 2 curious things happen. \n\n1) The next case was cake-walk. Non-Outlook related and was dealt with in 2 minutes.\n\n2) I get a message from $unknown \n\n&gt; $unknown: Hi, on ticket (tic#) can you expedite this case? \n\n(this is new) \n\n&gt; $me : Hi, unfortunately I cannot. At the moment I still have a number of things to check and I cannot escalate a ticket without following the troubleshooting procedures. \n\n&gt; $unknown: This is a very important case. She's a VIP and this needs to get resolved quickly. \n\n( I triple check the name. Doesn't match up with any known VIPs in the database)\n\n&gt; $me: I'll see what I can do. \n\n&gt; $unknown: Okay keep me updated. \n\nAt this point, I move on to the next case. And whilst being on call with the user, I send $TNSVV a message to check up on the issue.\n\nShe replies with:\n\n&gt; $TNSVV : No. Same thing. \n\nI assure her that I'll call her back as soon as I'm done with the case and I did. \n\n&gt; $me : Hey it's me again. Okay let's move on to the next step. We'll need to create a new profile. And while that is running, there's another thing I can check in the background as well. \n\n(Control Panel &gt; Mail (32-bit))\n\n&gt; $TNSVV : Uhmm, this has been done already. \n\n&gt; $me : Okay, if that's the case do you know if the profile creation was complete? \n\n&gt; $TNSVV : No, I wasn't paying attention. \n\n(......) \n\n&gt; $me: Okay if that's the case I'll re-do and we'll see what happens. \n\n(Profile creation is done. Profile_2 created. Confirmed OWA access is working as well) \n\n&gt; $me : Okay let's log in again. \n\n(I check the .ost file again. And sure enough, doesn't go past the 300 KB size)\n\n&gt; $me : I will say that at this point this does match with the outage symptoms. This is strikingly similar to what people are having. \n\n&gt; $TNSVV : And I am telling you it's not. I've been having this problem for the past 4 months now. \n\n(Of course you have. Next it'll be a year since your Outlook was not working correctly) \n\n&gt; $me : Okay, if that's the case, there's one last thing we can do. We'll reinstall Outlook completely. I'll run this in the background but since this does take time, please contact me once it's done. \n\n(Initiate uninstall, she pings me, asks her to restart, save my name on Communicator so that she can message me once it's done restarting) \n\n&gt; $me : Okay let's try with a fresh install and let's see what happens here. \n\n&gt; $TNSVV : You know, I've been quiet about this all this time, but this seems like a waste of my time. Just escalate this case. \n\n(It was at this point I drew comparisons between $TNSVV to female members of a certain animal species) \n\n&gt; $me : At this point, we're nearly done. Let me just finish this. We'll check what is or isn't working so that my report can be completed.\n\n&gt; $TNSVV: The report was already completed in the first place. \n\n&gt; $me: $TNSVV, it was far from complete. In fact if I made the ticket this way it would be grounds for termination and a far cry from the Standard Operating Procedure we all adhere to. \n\n(incoming ping from $unknown) \n\n&gt; $unknown: Ticket update please. \n\n&gt; $me: I'm with the user right now. Almost done. \n\n(Back to $TNSVV) \n\n&gt; $me : I appreciate that your time is valuable. But I do have to do this. The good news is we're almost done and I'll get the ticket escalated if this doesn't work. \n\n&gt; $TNSVV : Hmph \n\n&gt; $me: Alright then. Let's do this. \n\n(It doesn't work, as expected) \n\n&gt; $me: It's still doing the same thing as before. Hmm that's unfortunate. Let me get the computer's serial number and host name. I'll document everything and we'll see what the support team can do to get this resolved. I'll just need a m..... \n\n&gt; $TNSVV : I'm sorry what did you just say? \n\n&gt; $me: I'll get the computer's information, send it to the support team. We'll see what they can do. \n\n&gt; $TNSVV : What do you mean with \"What they can do?\" \n\n&gt; $me : Like I mentioned before, this case matches up with the symptoms of the current outage. As per your insistence that it is not, I have done all the troubleshooting that is required of me. I am not sure what the support team will do. I'll be honest, I wouldn't know what they want to do. If I did, I'd be paid the same amount of money they are getting. \n\n(She laughs one of those evil stepmother laughs) \n\n&gt; $me : Alright, here's your ticket number as before. And I know the OWA isn't a great workaround but at least for now you can send emails at the very least. \n\nAt this point, I message $unknown and let him know the ticket is updated. I go down for a well deserved smoke break. 10 minutes later I arrive at my desk and check Outlook for any notifications that the outage has been resolved. \n\nWhat happens instead is that I am CC-ed into an email that contains $TNSVV, the CEO for $TNSVV's region and our head of IT. It was sent by $unknown\n\nThe email read like this:\n\n&gt; Hi can we get confirmation that this ticket can be escalated? The end-user is very important to the company and we simply cannot afford to have her wait 3 weeks to get an issue with Outlook resolved. I would like to ask that the CEO fast track an escalation request so that the issue can be handled promptly as she is a VIP. \n\nI check $TNSVV's profile for the 4th time and again, it didn't return any indication that she was a VIP. \n\nConsidering that the outage was still ongoing and I had money to be earned, I kept working on tickets throughout the day. \n\n3 hours after this incident began, I get another email. A reply from the Head of IT to the email chain earlier. It was the sweetest one-line email I have read.\n\n&gt; This is related to the P2 outage. $TNSVV is not a VIP. I have assigned the ticket to the master ticket for the outage. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "**Looking for [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ddq86/adventures_in_wonderland_through_the_loony_glass/)?**  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**$LuLu:** Our manager.  \n**$TheAncientOne:** My director. Overall really cool guy but has a slight obsession with his collegeball team and $iFruit electronics.  \n**$Burrito:** New-ish in her IT career. Her preference to burritos is \"yes please\", and it fits well with her actual name.   \n**$Wonderland:** Previous employee. Personification of \"you're way too happy for a Monday morning\".  \n**$Savy:** Yours truly, also avid fan of lemonade.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**She was madder than the Hatter**  \nTo pick up where I left off, $Wonderland's upstairs office was by all means very quaint. There was enough room in there for cabinets in the back, a desk, and two chairs in front of the desk. Later on when $Lulu took that office she squeezed in a Lamp in the corner. With that in mind $Wonderland had packed that tiny office practically to the roof. Not only were there potted plants/tree in there but, for all intents and purposes, it looked like a one room studio apartment:  \n\n* Various scented candles  \n* Bags of food and drinks, even some snacks taped to the bottom of the desk  \n* Boxes full of folders and binders  \n* Blankets  \n* Both figurative and literal trash  \n* Smaller potted plants on desk tops  \n* Random knickknacks you'd expect to buy from the dollar store  \n* We eventually found her monitors and computer  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNeedless to say, this was beyond gross and could easily be labeled as the work area of someone with a hoarding disorder. By this point $TheAncientOne gave the verdict that if she hadn't already walked out on the job she was going to be fired due to her lack of work the past month and abuse of workspace. So, $Burrito and I were try to sort out the orders and do damage control while the rest of the team was to dismantle her ~~studio apartment~~ small office and move everything off to the warehouse.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFixing up the orders took the whole afternoon and involved $Burrito and I not only placing the orders but also having to make hard phone calls/emails letting our clients know that we dropped the ball all the way to the center of the earth. The rest of the crew was having way more fun with $Wonderland's office. Not only did they have to make multiple trips using **shipping carts** to empty out her office, but the mess left beyond gave the cleaning crew an eye twitch and enough of a back ache that I don't think anyone would have judged them for filing a workman's comp claim. To top it off, we almost ran out of space in the warehouse in the supply room where we were holding her stuff.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$TheAncientOne eventually heard back from $Wonderland after about a week. Nothing special there outside of the usual sob story of \"I'm so sorry, I never meant that to happen\" yadda yadda. The funny part definitely being that she was furious that we would empty out her now former office and she demanded that her items be returned to her. Not that we were holding her belongings hostage, but her items weren't necessarily something that could be put in a cardboard box and dropped off at her curb. So, we told her she would have to come back with a ~~moving truck~~ car to get her belongings herself. Though, this also gave us the opportunity to get things back from her like access cards, laptop, phone.....company cards (that we cancelled a week ago when we suspected she went rogue, but still). After a few hours her car was packed. My guess is that she had to have a few branches sticking out from rolled down windows to get it all to fit.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce she was officially fired that's when all of her horror stories had been made known:  \n\n* $Steve (coworker) mentioned that $Wonderland kept hitting on him. While the gesture would have been appreciated $Wonderland was old enough to be $TheAncientOne's younger sister while $Steve still gets mistaken for a high schooler.  \n* $RealEstate (Part time employee) told us how she had bumped into $Wonderland at the park. $RealEstate had been out with her son that day and $Wonderland threw herself at them and stalked them for the rest of the time they were there until the awkward \"Oh hey, we're at our car now. I guess this is where we part ways\".  \n* $Lulu came back from maternity leave and mentioned that the \"foot bath\" gift that she had gotten from $Wonderland during her baby shower was not safe to use on pregnant women. Furthermore, the product had expired years ago.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd that's it, that's the last we saw $Wonderland....well, at the office.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Resolution:**  \nShe has only been spotted twice since she was fired. Once at an art crawl that my town hosts once a month and another time during a fundraiser that happened just two days ago. Both instances she was as bubbly and creepy as ever pretending like she was still a part of the team.  To date, I still think our competitors sent $Wonderland our way just to mess with our heads \"You took our clients? Well, we're gonna take your sanity.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Formatting and spelling",

        "text": "This recent event came to mind while ~~reading TFTS at lunch~~ eating lunch today. \n\nA couple months ago, there had been a kind of minor software disaster at work.  (Can't really describe it without giving away too much info.)  We worked diligently to fix it, and all was well in the world after about 3 hours of troubleshooting and work.  Ledge goes home.\n\nLedge wakes up the next morning and promptly throws up.  (No, not hungover, but some kind of gross stomach bug or possibly mild food poisoning from dinner.)  Ledge knows he should be at work today, just in case the previous day's disaster rears its head in some way again.  Ledge phones in, letting work know he'll be in, but late.  Ledge throws up a couple more times then lies in a hot shower for about an hour until he feels vaguely human, gets work clothes on, and drives in.\n\nAs Ledge walks in, a coworker politely comments that Ledge looks like warmed-over hell, then lets him know that there is an emergency meeting in conference room [foo].  Uh oh, maybe the disaster is back.  Ledge quickly makes his way to the conference room, where he finds most of Ops present, as well as his own boss on the phone.  (Ledge is Dev, not Ops.)\n\nThere is a job that runs periodically to pull data off of a message queue and insert it into a database.  It hasn't run in 10 days and nobody can figure out why.  Things are getting panicky because the queue throws messages into the Upside-Down after 14 days and this is critical data.  Ledge sits down, boots his laptop, and pulls the code up.  \"OK, when the application runs, the first thing it does is check to see if there's a lockfile from another instance that is still running.  Have you looked to see if there's a hanging lockfile?\"\n\nOps checks.  There's a hanging lockfile.  They delete the lockfile and run the application.  It works.  The lockfile had been left over from the application crashing, sitting in the application's directory next to the crash dump and the log file.  Everyone thanks Ledge, and everyone gets on with the rest of the day's work.\n\nLedge's boss emails him a bit later to let him know that Ops had been looking at the box for almost two hours with him on the phone, and that he was a little upset that Ledge came in late, because he knew Ledge would be able to figure it out in under five minutes.  Ledge beat his estimation by around four minutes.",

        "text": "So this sort of thing has happened to me a few times. Caller reports a problem, I call back and everything is now working OK. They still expect me to fix a problem that no longer exists. I understand that sometimes you can do something to prevent a problem from re-occurring, but other times there is absolutely nothing to investigate or fix as everything is set correctly and working fine.  \n\n$Caller = Caller  \n$Me = Me (IT Support)  \n$OMC = Outsourced Maintenance Company for Photocopiers  \n  \nSo a ticket was raised today stating that they can no longer Scan from their Multi Function Device (Outsourced Maintenance), to a shared folder on our network. The available locations no longer show on the display of the Device when scanning.\nFirst thought is that someone has deleted the locations, or the device has somehow been factory reset. I web onto the IP of the device, check and see that the folders are still listed and registered OK. Good. Nothing lost, let's call the user to find out more. What followed was one of the most passive aggressive support calls I've ever had.\n\n&gt; $Me - Hi this is $Me calling from IT, can I speak with $Caller please?  \n&gt; $Caller - This is $Caller speaking.  \n&gt; $Me - I understand you have problems Scanning from your copier, the locations are no longer showing. Are you able to describe what you can see, and explain what does show on the copier?  \n&gt; $Caller - *Sigh* OK, but I will have to go all the way to the copier, hold on.\n\n*I know for a fact this copier is less than 5m away from the caller's desk*  \nA few minutes later $Caller returns.\n\n&gt; $Caller - The locations are now showing fine.  \n&gt; $Me - Oh, OK great. Could try scanning something just to confirm it is working correctly.  \n&gt; $ Caller - *Sigh* OK, hold on again.  \n\nA few minutes later again..\n\n&gt; $Caller - That has been scanned, and I've checked the folder and it has come across as expected.  \n&gt; $Me - OK great, all is working perfectly then. I'm not sure what happened previously, but I checked the copier and the locations were registered correctly, no configuration has been changed or lost. I will close this ticket now that everything is working.  \n&gt; $Caller - What do you mean? I'm not making this up, they were not showing I want this looked into further you cant close the ticket.  \n&gt; $Me - Sorry, I'm not disputing that there was ever a problem, but we have just tried it out and there is no longer a problem here, everything I have checked is all in order and working correctly. There is nothing left for me to investigate and the problem no longer exists.  \n&gt; $Caller - I just think IT need to spend some time looking into this.  \n\n*passive aggressiveness has escalated considerably*\n\n&gt; $Me - I'm sorry, but I have spent time looking at this, and I can see no problems relating to what you previously reported, and on testing all is fine. It may be something you could raise with $OMC , if there was a problem with the display on the device.  \n&gt; $Caller - Ah! but I **DID** speak with them, and they said that our **IT** need to setup the Scanning.  \n\n*I can tell by the tone that they think I am lying to try and get out of doing work, and they think they have caught me out*\n\n&gt; $Me - They are correct in saying that, we are responsible for setting up the scanning. In this case this has already been setup, I have confirmed that all the configuration is correct, and no configuration details have been lost. You have tested this to confirm this is working correctly. I was suggesting there may have been an issue with the display of the device, in which case $OMC would be responsible for fixing. I'm closing this ticket, please keep this ticket number as a reference, and feel free to re-open the ticket if the same problem should happen again.  \n&gt; $Caller - Oh I WILL  \n\nI now have a bad feeling I have jinxed myself by writing this post, and the problem will happen again. Either that or this ticket will be reopened for any minor issue they have with the copier. Wish me luck.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

        "text": "I support software for people who have to remember to take a breath every ten seconds. Our software is accessed through an online portal, where customers can access and manipulate their data and files. Our sales model usually involves customers being given a month or so on a trial run before signing onto the full contract.\n\nIt's one of these trial customers that I get a call from yesterday. The woman is very confused about just about everything--it takes a solid five minutes for me to figure out exactly which of our products she's probably talking about. \"Your guy was out here to train us, but I didn't understand most of it,\" she tells me. \"He gave me his business card, and I thought that would help, but when I tried to email him I was told he's no longer with y'all\" That's strange; I hadn't heard of any our salesfolk leaving us recently. Was it Tim she's thinking of? But he quit three months ago, well before their trial would've begun. I roll with it anyways.\n\nShe's having difficulties downloading files from the website. \"For backup,\" she says, \"but I can't figure out where to go for that.\" That's odd. Our software has a fairly minimal UI design. The [Download File] button is one of the very few actual buttons on the screen when users view a file.\n\nI ask her what she sees at the top of her screen--maybe she's in the wrong menu? \"A black bar...\" Okay, that's how all our site looks at the top. \"...then my name below that...\" Wait, that's not how our site's laid out. Usernames are on the top right, on the black bar. Is her browser all crunched up? \"...then 'finance'...then some arrows...below that is a yellow bar...\"\n\nYeah, I'm lost. None of those are aspects of our UI. I back up even further, asking her if she's at [OurWebsite dot com]. This is her mental limit, the poor thing, as she is now mumbling, dazed and confused, about \"well I went to *Product* in the bing...\" and \"when your guy was here, he did something, and there was a queue...\"\n\nI am not getting anything more out of this poor woman. I manage to guide her through the process of opening up a remote session for me...where I'm greeted by the website of our direct competitor, who use the URL [Product dot com]. Apparenly they're running concurrent trials with us *and* them.\n\nIt takes a further five minutes before she understands that I am not my competitor, and I cannot help her with their product.",

        "text": "&gt; $ME = ME\n\n&gt; $hit = Head of IT.\n\n&gt; $HHR = Head of HR\n\n&gt; $EVPIT = Executive Vice President of IT and Technology. (Yes… I know) \n\nSo yesterday was strange, to say the least. The meeting was scheduled for noon so the beginning of my day was pretty mundane. Handled a few issues with users who had purchased their own machines because “ours were not fast enough,” even though the ones they bought were supplied by us. But cest la vie. \n\nAt noon I walked into the conference room for the video review. $HIT was in there as well as the executive vice president of IT and technology. (yes I know) The conference started hilariously as the head of HR, or $HHR, could not get her video working. \n\nI walked her through how to fix that as it was a simple error. \n\n&gt; $ME – Have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in?\n\n&gt; $HHR – Oh duh. Should have known it was something stupid like that. \n\nWe started the conference and HOOO BOOOY. She was gunning for me hard. \n\n&gt; $HHR – So I have in front of me 19 complaints against you this year. Can you explain these?\n\n&gt; $ME – That’s it?\n\n&gt; $HHR - *Clearly not expecting that.* Uhh yes. How do you explain it?\n\n&gt; $ME – Well as you well know, each complaint is different and most do not have merit. \n\n&gt; $HHR – So you are saying these complaints were made…incorrectly?\n\n&gt; $ME – Yes that is exactly what I am saying. \n\nI pulled out the same folder she probably had. \n\n&gt; $Me – On Feb 12th *User* complained that I refused his request. \n\n&gt; $HHR – Good one to start with? Explain it. \n\n&gt; $ME - *user* wanted me to put a folder on his desktop that would allow him to transfer items between his local desktop and citrix. This is not possible unless he works on the domain…which he does not. I offered him several alternative options but he refused each one. He only wanted the original option of a folder on his desktop. \n\n&gt; $HHR – So this was impossible?\n\n&gt; $ME – Technology wise of course it is possible. We could have set him up with an FTP option to direct into his session. But that would never EVER get the approval. \n\n&gt; $HHR – Lets move on to the next one. *Different user* Claimed that you were rude to her on the phone and hung up on her. \n\n&gt; $me – Lets play the call log. \n\nThe call log is me being professional while she politely berates me on the phone…until she cusses me out. I terminate the call and send it to HR. \n\n&gt; $Me – That call is the reason why SHE is fired. Your predecessor said I handled it well. \n\n&gt; $HHR – Ok lets move on to the lady who had to wait 4 extra days to get her laptop back from you.\n\n&gt; $ME – Name?\n\n&gt; $HHR - *lady who yelled in my face* said you helped her 3 days in a row and finally took an extra 4 days to get her laptop back to her. \n\n&gt; $ME – You mean the lady who yelled in my face and got fired because of it? Yeah I remember her. I had to go to the hospital that Friday so none of my work got done. \n\n&gt; $HHR – I see the note here. You thought you had a hernia but it turned out to be a UTI?\n\n&gt; $ME – Thanks for repeating it here… Yes. Anyways the point is her laptop was finished within 2 hours of me returning to work. The 4 days she is talking about is because we had a 3 day weekend.\n\nThe meeting went on like this for well over 30 minutes as we ran through each complaint with only 1 that was legitimate. I misread a technical error and had to fix it 30 minutes later. Oh well. Then came the real kicker. \n\n&gt; $HHR – Lets talk about the fire you started. \n\n&gt; $ME – I STARTED!?\n\n&gt; $HIT – HE STARTED!? (same time.)\n\n&gt; $EVPIT – Wait what?\n\n&gt; $HHR – Per your report. The fuse box was overloaded when the third rack of servers plugged in and started a fire inside the wall that ended up burning out most of the building. \n\n&gt; $ME – Yes that does sound correct. What your report failed to mention on the report, which I have in front of me because I FUCKING sent it. (Yes I did say that.) The circuit breaker was not an actual circuit breaker. It was a bypass installed to bring the building up to code. The fuse box had cabinets built over it so that the owner could hide it. When too much was plugged into a mains line, which was rated to handle it, the fuse should have blown. But there was about 50 cents worth of pennies shoved in there. \n\n&gt; $HHR – How was this missed. \n\n&gt; $ME – I don’t know. I am not an electrician, I am not a state building inspector, I am not omniscient, and I am certainly not omnipotent. I went in to set up an office. \n\n&gt; $HHR – You appear to have an excuse for everything. \n\n&gt; $ME – Yes its called CYA. You literally have that on a poster in your office. \n\n&gt; $HHR – Now lets talk about your language to me yesterday. \n\n&gt; $ME – How about lets talk about your blatant disregard for the termination procedures you set in place. You created a paper snafu for my worker because you could not help yourself but to stick your nose where it does not belong. If you had followed procedure and not sent the termination paperwork through, he would have health insurance right now. Instead you decided to play tech and fired someone in the system. I spent 4 hours yesterday chasing paperwork and trying to keep this knowledge from him. \n\n&gt; $HHR – I Do not appreciate your attitude. \n\n&gt; $ME – And I do not appreciate you taking actions on your own. You may be HR but even you are not allowed to terminate employees without\n\n&gt; $EVPIT – OK That is far enough you have made your point $me. Remember that $HHR holds your job in her hand.\n\n&gt; $hit – Like a small bird.\n\n&gt; $EVPIT – Thank you $hit. So you do need to show her some respect…that being said. $HHR? He is right. You violated company policy, you tried to terminate an employee when it was not called for, and you created a mountain out of a single email. (Turning to me) Do you want to keep your job?\n\n&gt; $Me – Yes. \n\n&gt; $EVPIT – Then never take a disrespectful tone or cuss at a member of the senior management again. I expect a written apology to her by the end of the day. No further action needs to be taken here. (Turning to the monitor that has $HHRs face on it) As for you. \n\n&gt; $HHR – Yes?\n\n&gt; $EVPIT – You will apologize to both him and the employee you tried to terminate by the end of the day yourself. While he was disrespectful, cussed, and generally made an ass of himself, he is not wrong. You did overreact and wrongfully terminate a good worker forcing $ME here into overdrive trying to stop it in its tracks. You could have solved this by going to $ME when you first heard about it. I heard the call log and read everything about this incident. Simply put the end user was an idiot and needs to trust the people she calls to fix her computer. \n\nEVPIT stood up and gathered his things. \n\n&gt; $EVPIT – Hopefully this is the last I hear of any animosity towards upper management, or animosity coming from upper management. Good day people. \n\nEVPIT left and I went back to my desk apologizing for the attitude I took with the head of HR. At 4:55 PM the email came in from the head of HR apologizing for her role. I then had 5 minutes to explain to the tech what happened. He decided he owed me a lunch. \n\nI miss the Wahoo Lady. ",
