He can't tell he's not saying it right.\n\nWhich is presumably a joke but still reflects an attitude that deaf people can't understand written English because they can't speak it (which is actually a fairly common badling thing where it's assumed that someone can't read very well because they speak a non-standard form of English).\n\nThen this comment:\n\n&gt;Deaf people use sign language and sign language relies very heavily on facial expressions and body movement to convey things like context and meaning. If someone was born deaf and only ever communicated with sign language this is actually pretty close to how they would speak if possible.\n\nI actually once dated someone who worked as a deaf interpreter. She didn't use much facial expression when she interpreted. Some people do. Just like some people who talk use lots of voice inflection and some people don't. \n\n&gt;American Sign Language omits most sentence structure and a lot of unnecessary words, so when they type it out it appears strange and broken. I'm gonna assume this guy is actually deaf, tried, and failed to put a correct English sentence together.\n\nHuh? Who knew that ASL was one of the few language sin the world with no SVO? Oh wait, it does have SVO. And it doesn't ommit \"unnecessary words\". And typing it out is literally translating it from ASL to English, so that would be why it appears broken, just as if I were to try to translate to Spanish or some other language. \n\n&gt;This is totally normal for a deaf person. Source: dated a deaf girl in high school. In her notes to me she wrote like a retard, but in reality she was sharp and intelligent. Hell, we met in an advanced placement class. Think about it: a lot of our grammar and sentence structure knowledge comes from it \"just sounding right\" to us\n\nOh yeah, and to top it all off, deaf people sound like retards. \n\nEdit: Derp. Might help if I linked the thread.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldanarchists/comments/2zorxi/you_cant_tell_this_guy_to_english/",

        "text": "A man named Dr. Alexander Hamilton (no relation to the famous Hamilton) traveled to the colonies in 1744. In his journal he recorded the speech patterns of some of the people he ran across while traveling through New York.\n\n&gt;We went to supper, and our landlord Todd entertained us as he stood waiting with quaint saws and jack-pudding speeches. **“Praised be God,”** said he, **“as to cuikry, I defaa ony French cuik to ding me, bot a haggis is a dish I wadna tak the trouble to mak. Look ye, gentlemen, there was anes a Frenchman axed his frind to denner. His frind axed him ‘What ha’ ye gotten till eat?’ ‘Four an’ twanty legs of mutton,’ quo’ he, ‘a’ sae differently cuiked that ye winna ken whilk is whilk.’ Sae whan he gaed there; what deel was it, think ye, but four and twanty sheep’s trotters, be God.’”** He was a-going on with this tale of a tub when, very seasonably for the company, the bell, hastily pulled, called him to another room, and a little after we heard him roaring at the stair head, **“Dam ye bitch, wharefor winna ye bring a canle?”**\n\n[Source](http://laphamsquarterly.org/communication/city-talk)",
