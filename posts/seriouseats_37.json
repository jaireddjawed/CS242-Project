        "text": "Just a suggestion to those who might like the [Kenji video on supreme-ing citrus](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/04/knife-skills-how-to-cut-citrus-fruit-into-wedges-slices-and-supremes.html) - \n\nThere's a little trick that makes it just a little bit quicker, and a little bit cleaner.\n\nAfter the rind + pith are removed, put down your chef's knife / santoku / whichever, and pick up a paring knife. Cut into the fruit as you would otherwise. As Kenji describes,\n\n&gt;Holding the fruit in one hand, look for the thin strips of membrane that separate each segment. You're going to be cutting on either side of each of those membranes, as close as possible. Pick a segment, then insert your knife close to the inside of the membrane, cutting through almost to the core.\n\nNow, instead of taking the knife out and making another cut along the adjacent membrane to remove the citrus segment - don't remove the blade. Instead, with the blade at its max. depth, twist the blade of your knife away from the adjacent membrane as if you were cutting around the acute angle in the triangle - but you're not cutting, you're just lifting. Lift the knife up, and you can gently pull the citrus segment out with it. Have done this with just about every sort of citrus successfully and in volume. \n\nTwo advantages to this are (a) it's a little bit faster, and (b) it's a little bit cleaner. Rather than losing a little bit of the citrus flesh on either side of the membrane, you only lose it on one side of the membrane. \n\nFWIW this can be difficult on the very first segment, so I'll usually only do so on the second and third and fourth and so on segments.\n\n",

It almost immediately started smoking and it only got worse after I dumped the potatoes in (cause I'm clearly too stubborn to quit at this point).

I was hoping for some advice on how to put everything together.\n\nI've seen the [SE smoked pork shoulder char siu recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/06/smoked-char-siu-pork-shoulder-steaks.html), but I'm not sure how much utility I can get out of it considering I'm a) not smoking, and b) using a lean tenderloin instead of a fatty shoulder. [This Eat Tender recipe](https://www.eattender.com/recipes/char-sui-pork-tenderloin) will probably be my starting point.\n\nI'm hoping y'all have some advice on the marinade/in-the-bag part. I know adding fats to a sous vide cook has a negligible or detrimental effect, but I'd like the sauce flavor to be stronger rather than weaker.\n\nOne thought I had for the process was to: marinade overnight in a bowl, scrape the marinade off with a silicone something, bag it for sous vide, cook, then combine the marinade, sous vide liquids, and reserved sauce to reduce all together - strain through a chinois at some point. \n\nDoes this make sense? Any improvements or other advice? Should I also add some liquid smoke (how much, when/where?) to make up for the fact that it's not getting a long smoke? And what would be recommended for the sear anyway? I can broil or grill, or do a cast iron pan (or enameled dutch oven). The stove is an induction that gets hotter than I've ever been able to make use of.\n\nThanks in advance, and sorry for any dumb omissions!\n\nEdit: I have two planned alterations, neither of which should, I think, have much of an unintended affect. 1) omitting fennel seed as I don't care for them and don't have any besides. 2) Possibly reducing the brown sugar if the sweet starts to overpower the other flavors in the sauce.",

        "text": "Getting hit by a major snowstorm today and have the day off, so I decided to make a little more than oatmeal for breakfast this morning and made bacon, homefries, and eggs in the cast iron.  This is the first time I made homefries since reading about [The Best Roasted Potatoes Ever](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/12/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe.html) so I decided to try it out for homefries as well, and they were definitely the crispiest homefries I've ever made! I decided to take a few shortcuts because usually in the mornings I don't feel like cooking and cleaning a bunch of stuff (plus I'm usually short on time), so here's what I did (plus how to make an awesome breakfast in ~15 minutes).\n\n1. Put 3-4 (or 10) slices of bacon into a cast iron pan on medium heat.\n\n2. While the bacon's cooking, peel and cut up one potato into 3/4 inch pieces.  Put in microwaveable safe bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and cook for 4-5 minutes (depending on your microwave).\n\n3. When then potatoes are done, CAREFULLY remove plastic wrap. Steam's going to escape quickly, so don't get burned like I did my first time doing this.  Put a tablespoon or so of vegetable oil in the bowl and toss the ever loving hell out of them to rough up the surface of the potatoes. Set aside\n\n4. Once the bacon is done, remove and put on a paper towl lined plate. Put the potatoes in the pan with the bacon fat, and evenly distribute them. And don't you even think about moving them around, let them sit there and brown.\n\n5. Stir and brown on all sides until their done. Season (I like salt, freshly ground pepper, and Old Bay seasoning), stir, and remove from the pan.\n\n6. Remove the pan from the heat; there's plenty of heat in there to cook the eggs.  Crack however many eggs you want into the pan, and flip once the first side is done. I like mine runny so I only cook them another minute or so off the heat, but if you, for some reason, want them more firm, you can return to the burner on low until they are done to your liking.\n\n\n\n",

The flavor and juiciness was there, and I was very happy with how they tasted, but the raw mix and resulting patties were too crumbly and fell apart. I cooked them in a cast iron pan. The only change I made was using pre-ground (85-15) turkey since I don't have a grinder. I read the comments on the recipe, and Kenji admits the mix will be sloppier than normal but they should still hold up fine. Even after some time in the fridge, they were a little difficult to work with.\n\nMy question: For those who have made these, how did they turn out for you? Was the mix sloppy or was it firmer for you? Did you make any tweaks or add back in any egg or breadcrumbs?\n\nFor my purposes and personal taste, I think I am going to keep the anchovy-soy-marmite flavor additions while include back in egg and breadcrumbs in the future.

        "text": "The Super Bowl got off to a rollicking start, with some attendees making early pronouncements of \"best one ever.\" It was half-time, drinks had been re-filled; Lady Gaga had mic-dropped and bounced her way out of her outstanding set; and we started to relax, starting to revel in a job well done.   \n   \nAnd then it happened... The poppers came out. As the throngs rushed to stake their claims, it became abundantly clear to all that we had somehow managed to overlook the dip. I dug deep and came up with a mild and sweet Jalapeño jelly from the back of the fridge, but it was too late to quell the altercation that had meanwhile errupted.   \n   \nNo less than six differing and passionately held opinions were thrust  forth, on the appropriate dipping sauce is for jalapeño poppers! One of the key fault lines was sweet vs. savory. There were plum proponents, ranch supporters, and salsa enthusiasts. In the end there was no show of unity or understanding whatsoever, and we had to cut off all discussion, and move on as quickly as possible to the baked wings.   \n   \nThe whole thing definitely left a dark cloud on the evening, leaving entrenched differences of opinion and resentment in its wake. And so, we turn to you, dear friends! Does anyone know what the actual, true, and most appropriate sauce for poppers is? The internet is seemingly quite lacking for a decisive verdict, and for much real history on the dish of any kind.   \n   \nWhatcha got, Eaters? We know we can count on you for your vast intelligence, considered and thoughtful opinions, and your calm hand on the rudder in these volatile times.",

I was thinking you could get potentially moister wings with better temp control as well as being somewhat more hands off especially on a day when I would rather be somewhat more hands off on my cooking.  Time/temp wise I was thinking 165F for 4 hours or so and using the trick from the porchetta/and other sous vide recipies with skin of adding baking powder before cooking.  Am I way off base here?  ",

Two questions though.\n\n1. I would love to make a big batch of dough, freeze it already shaped, and then pull out 4 to thaw overnight and cook the next morning. Is this doable, and if so, should I be freezing before or after the boiling step?\n\n2. The one thing missing for us was the \"chewiness\" of the inside. What would we change to make it more chewy / less doughey? I let it sit in the fridge for 22 hours.\n\n3. Picture! http://imgur.com/gallery/tkDfG\n\nedit: Also, we shared these with one of our neighbors who grew up on the LES in the 40s and 50s. He agreed that crust and flavor were spot on and commented that the size was much more correct than what he has seen in years.\n\nedit 2: after spending the day looking at other bagel recipes, was wondering, should we let the bagels come to room temp our of the fridge or take them straight from fridge to boiling water?\n\nedit 3: E-mailed with BraveTart about my questions. Her suggestion was to kneed longer, let them rise for the full 36 hours. She said no need to let the dough come up from fridge temps before boiling and had no feedback re: freezing although its something she is looking into. My plan is to try the recipe again this weekend with a few extra destined for a freezer experiment. ",

I have a vacuum sealer at home which keeps frozen things in pretty great shape.\n\nDo you think I can make the wet vegetable part of the meatloaf (cooked vegetable mixture, umami boosters, liquid, gelatin) and seal/freeze it? I figure that the cooking and tiny chop of the vegetables means that I don't have any real texture loss risks.",
