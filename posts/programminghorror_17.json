In 2012, the decision came down that we wouldn't be doing new development on this software.  Basically, we had a functional solution, the big requirements weren't going to change, and we didn't have any competitor's that we would need to worry about.  So for the last 5 years, a small team of folks have been selling, installing, making bug-fixes, and small enhancements to support this software.  Great!\n\nFast forward to now.\n\nA few weeks ago one of the folks on the support team left the company, and management asked me to fill in for the next month.  Of course, first thing I want to do is get access to version control, and get the latest versions of the software to get back up to speed.\n\nToday, I got access to TFS.  Last commit was by me.  In 2012.\n\nOh no.",

It is a (weirdly) hybridized Spring/Angular web application with antipatterns galore:\n\n1. Mixing Angular and jQuery in such a way that it'll be difficult to separate the two.\n2. Having the Angular and Spring parts as two separate Maven projects. This makes for some interesting build steps to say the least.\n3. Using `ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt;` instead of having an exception handler to handle all sorts of application errors. This also requires the use of a `JSONUtils.toJson` method to convert POJOs to JSON strings to make this antipattern work. Seriously, it's a Spring 4 project and this should have been done this way.\n4. The style looks to have been designed by someone who skipped Contrast Day at Web Design School. Oh, and Non-Tacky Design Considerations Day too. Seriously, gradients that cause your right menu to be almost hidden?\n5. Crummy fonts. It's cool that you want to use a font no one else is using, but did you have to pick something that points out that your designer has no sense of style?\n6. Using Bootstrap but not sticking with its clean sense of style, so you get nicely styled Bootstrap controls with not-so-nicely styled CustomApp controls.\n7. `'use strict'` everywhere.\n8. An example usage of Angular1 with TypeScript in the application, and removal of such causes the build to fail.\n8. And my personal favorite: the password field on the login page is worthless. Remember the `getauthorizatedUser` method? Yeah, that's how logins are done.\n\nI was assigned by my boss who thinks that Spring web applications are the solution for everything and \"knows the Spring framework better than I do\" (quotes for my sarcastic assumption).\n\nSeriously, this application is a Pit-o-WTF^(TM) and makes me cry. Even the kid in my software engineering class who wanted to \"reuse\" his authentication code that was totally vulnerable to SQL injection (strangely his registration code wasn't) had a better sense of security than the guy who first coded this application.",

        "text": "So I remembered this story because of a post in /r/sysadmin and I figured it would be appreciated here as well..\n\nSo some 5 years ago I worked as a developer at this rather large company, at the time 500+ employees. At the time they had some 2 data centers, right now they have over 10 data centers all over the world..\n\nSo one day human resources sends out a mail that they have this new system to send out the payment receipts. Its on some website that was built by another company. To get your username is your RFC (kind of a tax ID code, publicly availabe and you use it to make tax invoices) and password is your employee number..\n\nSince those receipts basically show how much everybody is earning and whatnot, this information obviously is confidential, yet for some retarded reason they didn't stop to think that both the user id and password both were publicly available.. So I went to the director of HR, and told her this was a very very bad idea. She didn't agree, it was impossible for people to see each others salary information. So I left, and one hour came back with her personal salary receipts printed out.\n\nThis convinced her that the company who did this wasn't entirely mentally sane, so she asked me to sit down with their developer and go over the code, and ensure it was safe.\n\nTurns out their \"developer\" was a 21 yo girl straight out of college with exactly 0 development experience. Turns out that the sign in system that she made would first do a DB query for the name. name exists? okay, great! Do another query for the (obvioulsy stored in blank) password. Exists? great! You're in! Soooo.. I could use ANYONES username, and my password, and I'm in their account. Also she didn't even know what data validation was, or sql injection, or xss attacks, or encryption etc.. So none of that implemented either. \n\nThis was only part of the large slew of issues I found in her code but since I only had half a day with her, we only resolved the most horrific things I could find in there.\n\nSo I told HR about how stinking this turd of a website was, and they then responded two weeks later with sending me a box filled with files and a USB stick with around 1GB of data, and asked me to make an employees management site out of this.\n\nThis data was excel files, photos, etc that contained all medical, physical, mental, financial, etc information of all their employees. Mind you, a few months before the company hired a company to send doctors and nurses to do a medical checkup on all employees. A quick glance showed me that a number of employees were HIV positive, some had certain types of cancers, some had mental issues, there were x-ray images, I could see how much money everybody was earning... it was one MAJOR WTF? They did not even had me sign a confidentiality contract on this and it seriously scared the living crap out of me. I returned everything, told them that this was just plain insane, and I stopped working there a couple of months later (not only because of this incident, there had been many, MANY incidents that all together made me quit)..\n\nMind you, this was a large company back then and right now I estimate them to have thousands of employees, and I can only hope they improved their privacy procedures.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, the \"21 yo girl\" was not meant to say that girls cannot be programmers. it just happened to be a girl, but she had absolutely no idea what she was doing\n\nEdit: this was not a US company, so no hippa\n\nEdit: added some more info ",

        "text": "Context: This is for an online order form for a ski resort.\n\nHad a client inform us that their site wasn't functioning correctly so I took a look to see what was going on. I didn't make this, and have only touched a couple things on it, so I'm barely familair with how the previous developer set it up (who no longer works here.) The problem was that an order form wasn't correctly showing the selected options on the confirmation page. The code was handling POST data, which was confusing the hell out of me because the confirmation page is a GET request. I dug a bit deeper and saw that all of the data is being stored in a session, so I did a quick search for $_SESSION to hopefully see what is going on. Well, I found out:\n\n    $_POST = isset($_SESSION['posted_vars']) ? $_SESSION['posted_vars'] : '';\n\n    $type = (isset($_POST['type']) ? $_POST['type'] : '');\n    $dt = (isset($_POST['date']) ? $_POST['date'] : '');\n    $email = (isset($_POST['email']) ? $_POST['email'] : '');\n    $first_name = (isset($_POST['first_name']) ? $_POST['first_name'] : '');\n    $last_name = (isset($_POST['last_name']) ? $_POST['last_name'] : '');\n    $address = (isset($_POST['address']) ? $_POST['address'] : '');\n    $phone = (isset($_POST['phone']) ? $_POST['phone'] : '');\n    $city = (isset($_POST['city']) ? $_POST['city'] : '');\n    $postal_code = (isset($_POST['postal_code']) ? $_POST['postal_code'] : '');\n\n    $passholder_count = (isset($_POST['passholder_count']) ? $_POST['passholder_count'] : '');\n    $passholder = (isset($_POST['passholder']) ? $_POST['passholder'] : '');\n    $dob = (isset($_POST['dob']) ? $_POST['dob'] : '');\n    $pass_opt = (isset($_POST['pass_opt']) ? $_POST['pass_opt'] : '');\n    $relation = (isset($_POST['relation']) ? $_POST['relation'] : '');\n    $use_photo = (isset($_POST['use_photo']) ? $_POST['use_photo'] : array());\n    $boot_locker_opt = (isset($_POST['boot_locker_opt']) ? $_POST['boot_locker_opt'] : array());\n    $ski_storage_opt = (isset($_POST['ski_storage_opt']) ? $_POST['ski_storage_opt'] : array());\n\nFuck you.\n\nNow that I solved that mystery, I had to figure out why some checkboxes aren't being tracked as having been checked. They're being stored in the session data like this:\n\n    [boot_locker_opt] =&gt; Array\n    (\n        [0] =&gt; 1|5310\n        [1] =&gt; 1|5310\n    )\n\nThat doesn't make sense, but at least there are two chunks of data and my test had two ski passes. The 5310 is the price of the boot locker rental in pennies, but I had no idea what the 1 was supposed to mean. So I took a look at how that array is being parsed:\n\n    $bLockr = array();\n    foreach($boot_locker_opt as $ele) {\n        $tmp = explode('|', $ele);\n        $bLockr[$tmp[0]-1] = $tmp[1];\n    }\n\nWell that's descriptive. *Fuck you.*\n\nIt wasn't until I spotted this HTML in the order form that I figured out just what was going on:\n\n    &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"use_photo[]\" id=\"use_photo_1\" value=\"1|on\"&gt;\n\nAll of the checkboxes for each individual ski pass that the customer is ordering is formatted like that. The problem was that when the customer clicks the \"Add Another Pass\" button, and it generates the new HTML, it didn't update the 1, so even though there might be 5 passes they would all be treated as checkboxes for the first pass and thus ignored. (Yes, it starts at 1 and then has to be decremented by 1 to make it 0-indexed as in the code above.)\n\n**FUCK YOU.**",

        "text": "I found this sub, directly subscribed, and immediately have a good story for you guys. This will be a pretty long story, so grab a cup of coffee, and enjoy. There is no **TL;DR** at the end, but I try now: **Customer made mistakes, blamed me and lied.**\n\nAt the beginning of last year, I was driving with my boss to the airport. The sales dude from our American partner called. He told us that he was discussing stuff with our customer about getting their software to our current project, where I was the project lead (just after 1 year overall experience). He told us, that the customer plans to buy the partner software now. At the beginning they couldn't afford the partner software, so they stayed with our simpler one that covers other aspects of the company. That sales dude told us that they plan to migrate everything to a new infrastructure, including the movement of the current running from us. He asked if this will cause problems. I thought about it, and told him that this should be quite easy, if the environment stays the same. I asked one of our most experienced development seniors and he told me that I said the right thing.\n\nFast forward to the end of last year. The migration had to be done. The customer planned to have as less downtime as possible. As I usually do, I wanted to copy the files to the new system, to save that transfer time. I asked multiple days before to get the access. I got the access exactly on the day of the migration. So no saving of time. \n\nOn that day, I got the access at 11 AM. You know why? Because the customers \"IT Specialist\" didn't manage to install and configure the SQL-Server of the DB-machine, which should already be finished days before. I noticed that when I asked for the access to the new database machine. \n\nSo, I was already late 3 hours. Yes, I waited those three hours, because the \"IT-Specialist\" was going to give me the access in \"some minutes\", for 3 hours. Then I transferred the files for an hour, because I didn't expect the connection to be so shitty. I was send to another country by my boss for 3 months, so I was using the bad internet there. I had to copy from one Remote Desktop to my computer to another Remote Desktop. \n\nAfter an hour passed, the IT-Specialist asked, if he should create a shared folder. 4 hours lost until now. He seriously asked, if we could manage to be done at 1 PM, because this was defined that way. Nobody told me about that. They just set 1 PM as the time, where the production could continue, without asking anything. \n\nAs soon as the files were copied, an hour should be enough. I unzipped the files, started our software system, and it didn't start. Surprise! Java was missing on the machine. They didn't install anything what was on available on the previous machine. I had to. \n\nOur software still didn't start because that fool didn't create a user for it. Our system does that by itself on the first launch, if it realizes that it is an initial startup. Since it was just a move, it didn't. Since I wasn't allowed to do that \"for security reasons\", that bum did that. User was created, but connection got rejected. It took me some time to find out that the created user didn't got any permissions at all. Nothing, not even access, not even execution Select-statements. It took him three attempts to set them right. \n\nAfter this was running, other software components had to be installed that were already running before I joined the company, so I head to research how stuff is done. \n\nInstead of 5 hours the whole migration took us 3 days. \n\nYou know what the best part is? Afraid of losing their jobs everybody from the customer company lied. The IT-Specialist complained that nobody told him. First, he didn't ask anything, second, he had the old system as a pattern. My boss later had a list in front of him with complaints. He asked me about them, and there were points that were totally not true, blurry, or simply completely out of context. Some of my answers were \"I have no idea. I don't even know what they are trying to tell on that point.\" One funny point was that the file transfer took 6 hours. I told my boss that this is a lie. He asked me why the customer would lie about that. I answered with the exact activity of the day. It was totally unrealistic. There were mails, were I stated when what was finished. If the transmission took 6 hours, things would never been able to be done at that time. Everybody from them lied to the steering committee to move their faults onto us/me. Guess who they believed?\n\nI had to do dumb stuff like creating stupid documents, which were listing my mistakes, and how I plan to correct them in future. They wanted to see that we still have interest in a cooperation. In this document I had to take mistakes from their staff on me, and list how I plan to correct it. In the first draft I neutrally wrote down how things where, and how things should be done better. I also did mistakes, but in the end it stated how it was: Most of the mistakes were done on their side. I had to present it internally first, in front of all customers. They all told me that it sounded salty, so I had to change it, even if things were not true, and I blamed everything on myself. Shortly after that I planned to look for another job, and leave (I didn't in the end).\n\nMy company started to hate that customer and I noticed that I am not alone. I got retracted from the project, because the customer was delaying stuff (like they always did). My boss got angry so he removed me and set this as the project with the lowest priority. If they take their time, we will also do that. Today, that customer is the target of jokes, and we see them as a bunch of retards. We sold them even more software, and other colleagues are working on it. The customer is still setting unrealistic dates, none of them was manageable. Mostly on their side. Now, we have our American Partner and our Italian Partner, who have enough income to buy that customer company just to burn it for the funs. So things changed. Their IT-Specialists made it clear by now to be way too incompetent, and the customer already knows, too. They lack in basic concept that should be required for their jobs. The reason why they keep them: They don't find anybody else in the rural area.\n\nToday, I feel kinda mixed about this. I am kind of angry, you know why. I am kind of relieved to not even need to speak with them. I enjoy that they are the source material for great jokes and running gags, here.\n\nEDIT: SQL user = login",

        "text": "I have been working on a project that requires creating a plug-in for a CAD-type piece of software over the last week. \n\nFor various reasons, I had 4 different folders for various iterations of the project. Already you begin to see the horror and foolishness. \n\nFast foward to last night, wherein I send off the functional prototype, having given it very-short-timeline and prototype-level testing. After this, I decide to be such a good dev boye and consolidate, remove excess folders, remove duplicate repos, and bring everything to a sane single repo should this project go forward. \n\nToday, the client returns and says there's a bug, with a screenshot. I see the issue. 30 second turnaround, no problem. \nOnly to discover that my entire project is intact, except for the CAD plugin. It is in it's original, example, default state. Apparently the plugin source and solution was one project folder, while I had been working on the entire rest of the project from a different folder. And I, being the extremely fastidious and annoyed-at-excess-files person that I am, deleted these folders and emptied the recycle bin. So these files are gone, and gone for good. No repos ever had these changes committed because of working in the wrong folder. \n\nSo today when the client got back to me, I said I was busy today but would look at the issue tonight. And am currently in the process of decompiling MY OWN CODE from .dlls in the plugin directory so that I don't have to re-write everything from scratch. \n\nI hope you find my tears amusing. \n\nAll Hail ILSpy\n\n",
