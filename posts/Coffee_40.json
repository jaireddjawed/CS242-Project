Comments, input, and feedback are always welcome. u/GreeenCoffeee was very helpful last week in clarifying some of the terminologies around commodity futures.\n\n## Equipment\n\n* [Mahlkonig announces a limited edition EK43 called ‚ÄúThe Icon‚Äù.](https://youtu.be/Zlc542AwFp0)\n\n*This announcement was over a month ago in what seems to be an unlisted YouTube video. I‚Äôve held off adding this to the newsletter because no official statement has come from Mahlkonig but, the video is still up so I‚Äôve decided to put it out there.*\n\n*The EK43 is the most iconic grinder in coffee shop culture and obviously dominates high-traffic specialty locations all over the world. I think this 999-limited-edition version will only be cosmetic but each one is going to be a talking point in the respective cafes they end up in.*\n\n## Industry\n\n* [Miko purchases Bayer‚Äôs out-of-home business in Belgium](https://www.worldcoffeeportal.com/Latest/News/2023/January-(1)/Belgium-s-Miko-Group-takes-over-Beyers-Koffie-s-ou)\n\n*Miko has posted consistently good returns over 2022 so it‚Äôs not surprising to see them snapping up other businesses this year. Miko does roughly the same thing (out of home coffee) all over Europe and it seems that Bayer was not interested in that part of the market.*\n\n* [Roast Summit 2023 dates announced](https://www.roastmagazine.com/roastsummit/events/2023online)\n\n*I'll likely be attending this event due to my personal interest in coffee roasting and the convenient time zone for me.*\n\n*Chris Kornman's talk on data in the process will be the highlight and the \"can't miss\" for me.*\n\n* [Reborn Coffee to add new locations in California and S Korea](https://stockhouse.com/news/press-releases/2023/01/05/reborn-coffee-adds-retail-locations-in-california-and-korea)\n\n## Events\n\n* [Birmingham Cofee Festival announced for 8th - 9th July 2023](https://www.birminghamcoffeefestival.com/)\n\n*This is for Birmingham, UK*\n\n* [International Cafe and Beverage Show announced for 25th to 27th May 2023 in KL, Indonesia](https://intl-cbs.com/)\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nI've just got back from Berlin which is, in my humble opinion, the best cafe city in the world and certainly the best I've visited. A combination of low rents\\*, a young urban population, and late nights mean that you can't move for aesthetic high stools or grungy deep velvet sofas. The coffee itself is broadly great but the vibes are immaculate.\n\nI also acquired some specialty coffee equipment from the Sunday markets of Germany, in particular a 1950s Melita ceramic pour-over cup. Makes fine coffee but looks subtly retro while *dripping* style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Image of a white retro Melitta dripper on top of a red mug.](https://preview.redd.it/anckvt42y7ba1.jpg?width=2543&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dac31dcf5f79bf11d34daa47938930d609d8091f)\n\n\\*This is slowly being lost apparently.",

Unfortunately, the smell of coffee is really strong and she says it's the worst smell ever right now. It will wake her up out of a dead sleep and take her hours to fall back asleep.

So before my wife leaves me please help me make a good cup of coffee. I've attached photos of the grind settings I'm using.\n\nThe questions I have are:\n\n- Is the coffee I'm using trash?

        "text": "So I bought these lovely Ethopian beans from a good roaster nearby. I mostly use a V60. As many Ethiopian beans tend to do, the beans stall quite a bit. I assume that there are a lot of fines or a lot more than usual. For a grind setting that gives me approx. 2:30 brews for 250ml the brews take 3:30-4. It's the beans not the grinder, as I don't have this issue with other beans, unless I excessively agitate and I haven't had clogging issues with my Ode + SSP.\nNow, what do I do? When grinding where I usually do or slightly coarser it tastes fine (some sips quite nice actually) but I feel like there's something that mutes flavour. That makes sense because of the fines. Grinding substantially coarser doesn't really make sense I guess. It doesn't significantly decrease brew time (the long brew times come from stalling and not from a grind that is too fine, so grinding coarser hasn't really decreased brew times) and it makes it taste worse, because the non-fines are too coarse. Actually, those brews tasted the best so far that were at more or less the same grind setting as other beans I've used.\n\nWhat I haven't gotten to try yet is use a recipe with little to no agitation or maybe a recipe that doesn't fill up the cone as much (more water in the cone that presses down increases fine migration afaik and therefore potential clogging). Would that work, what do you think? Do you have other strategies you use?\n\nThanks",

        "text": "What‚Äôs good r/Coffee!\n\nI have been spending a lot of time this past year/year and a half experimenting with cocktails. This past week my partner has been on call with work, being responsible and staying off the booze. So it got me thinking, ‚ÄúWhat kinda fun drinks can I make with coffee?! Especially using some of my cocktail gear.‚Äù I don‚Äôt have a full espresso setup so steamed milk drinks were off the table.\n\nWell, it didn‚Äôt take long for the Caffe/Espresso Shakerato to pop into my brain. I‚Äôve seen stuff about it before but never had a shaker on hand or any cool glassware to serve it in. I love drinking cocktails with egg white, so the bubbly/frothy result you get from these drinks was really intriguing to me.\n\nWell, yesterday was the day. It was 1pm-ish and I was looking for a quick afternoon treat so figured it was perfect timing. I looked at a few recipes and the first one that showed up was [THIS ONE](https://www.seriouseats.com/caffe-shakerato-italian-shaken-iced-coffee) from Serious Eats. Might not be the most traditional place for coffee culture but I use a ton of their recipes \n\nTheir recipe was:\n\n* 4 ounces ice cubes (about 4 to 6 cubes)\n* 1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon; 15g) sugar\n* 2 fluid ounces (60ml) freshly made hot espresso\n\n1. Add ice and sugar to a cocktail shaker. Pour hot espresso on top, seal shaker, and shake vigorously until thoroughly chilled, 10 to 20 seconds.\n\n2. Strain iced espresso into a cocktail glass, coupe, or other glass vessel and serve right away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How I make the \"Espresso\"**\n\nI can‚Äôt make espresso at home (not much counter space in my 1 bedroom) but I do have a Fellow Prismo  that helps me get CLOSE to espresso.\n\nMy recipe is as follows:\n\n* 18g finely ground coffee (not espresso grind but close. Like you would for a Moka Pot)\n* 85g water straight off the boil\n* Add Prismo to bottom of the aeropress and add in coffee. Pour water, straight off the boil to 85g. Stir or swirl to incorporate\n* Steep for \\~45 sec to 1 min. Plunge into cup.\n\n**Issue with Sugar**\n\nIf you're adding sugar to the recipe, I feel like syrups are always better. Obviously the espresso is hot and will likely dissolve based on how hard I shook this drink. But I'd rather not take that risk.\n\nI also ALWAYS have various syrups on hand at home and yesterdays was a Rich (2:1) Demerara Syrup in the amount of 0.5oz. I like the extra molasses-y flavours that the Demerara brings out.\n\n**My Experiments**\n\nI made one run of the Shakerato and it was passable. I used a bit of an older coffee in my current collection and feel like that may have been part of the problem.\n\nBut then I used a coffee I felt would fit a little better for the drink. It was an anaerobic washed Bolivian, seen [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/pbUlvdL). I also expressed some lemon zest/peel over the top (like you do with a lot of cocktails). [HERE is the end result.](https://imgur.com/a/3x9mPeR)\n\n**The Lemon was a Game Changer**\n\nI CANNOT TELL YOU ENOUGH how much the lemon improved this drink. The bright/citrusy aroma you get from the lemon just adds a whole other dimension to this drink. When I first had heard of lemon and coffee pairing I only scoffed at it, as it sounded ridiculous. But, let me tell you, adding the lemon to this drink makes it so, so, SO much better. You get the aroma of the lemon up front, the molasses-y sweetness from the Demerara up front and the more roasty/chocolatey notes from the coffee on the back end, along with the more fermented notes from this anaerobic coffee.\n\n**My Recipe**\n\nThe recipe I am currently sitting on (which may be change in the future) is as follows:\n\n* 4 ounces ice cubes (about 4 to 6 cubes)\n* 1/2 ounce ‚Äì Rich Demerara syrup (feel free to drop to ¬ºoz or remove if you want it less sweet) (**note 1, note 2**)\n* 2 fluid ounces (60ml) freshly made hot espresso or aeropress coffee brewed as above\n* 1 strip of lemon zest (for expressing on drink)\n\n1. Add ice and syrup to a cocktail shaker. Pour hot espresso/aeropress coffee on top, seal shaker, and shake vigorously until thoroughly chilled, 10 to 20 seconds (kinda depending on your preferred level of froth/foam up top).\n\n2. Double strain into a cocktail glass (ie. coupe, Nick and Nora) or other glass vessel. I like to double straing \n\n3. Express and garnish with a zest/peel of lemon.\n\n4. Enjoy right away!\n\n**Note** **1** ‚Äì I started with the 1/2oz of rich syrup as I feel it got closer to the original recipe I looked at, in terms of sweetness. However, my partner said it was a little bit sweet for her tastes. I do find my recipe to be somewhat dessert-y. You can reduce the sugar to suit your sweetness tastes. It‚Äôs mainly the surfactants in the coffee that create the foam. However, it is in my own experience that some sugar does help keep the structure of the foam a little more. But your mileage may vary!\n\n**Note 2** ‚Äì If you're feeling spicy, feel free to add to or sub your sugar for your favourite liquer (ie. Sambuca, Amaretto, Mr. Black Coffee Liquer even) or amaro (I like Averna, Montenegro or Braulio). It‚Äôs really up to you and your taste / sweetness / bitterness preferences!\n\nI‚Äôd love to know if any of you have better/different/other options for this kind of a drink. If you do, I‚Äôd love to hear about your recipe and methods!",

Although the coffee that is coming out is still good, I am slightly concerned that I am down to such low clicks for filter brew - I believe I should be around 20/25 clicks and have previously brewed at around 22 clicks.\n\nIs it worth contacting customer support or should I not be bothered considering the performance is still good?\n\nFYI - I have disassembled the grinder to clean and all the parts seem to be in the right place etc.\n\nAny help is much appreciated!

Please add to this, or let me know if any methods may not quite work, or most importantly, where diminishing returns set in. \n\nIn order of least to most effort, and theoretically most return on freshness \n\n1) Original bag, sticking a vacuum on the one-way valve. Sacrilege. \n\n2) Dosing into multiple ziplock bags or mason jars\n\n3) Reusable vacuum bags. These can get quite expensive, but may be worth it? Hopefully someone who knows more than I do can comment on that. Also can mitigate cost by buying generic branded sous vide bags, which may be unsafe, so maybe double bag?\n4) foodsaver vacuum seal your weeks' coffee, put in another bag to avoid anything getting in",

The coffee, as expected, was horrid. It completely lacked clarity of flavour, was filled with muddiness and harsh bitterness.",

I plugged it in and then started looking at the manual for the first use cleaning instructions. After a couple of minutes I noticed it was smoking and smelled like burning plastic so I unplugged it immediately. I washed all the removables twice, ran a cycle with vinegar three times and a rinse cycle three times.\n\nI've been using it because it helps me have less interaction with my toxic family, but i'm scared of it. I ditched the plastic mug it came with because it gave a real plasticy taste that would stay with me throughout the day. Using a normal mug it has a slight plasticy aftertaste but not as bad.\n\nI'm scared it might not be safe because I'm worried that my little incident destabilized some of the plastic and now all kinds of neurotoxins and other bad things are leeching into my coffee and killing my brain and body. I think it might be polypropylene but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nShould I be worried or is it safe to use? Thank you.",

Some speak in terms of microns. Some in terms of course salt. I've also noticed that a lot of people are having the same questions and problems that I do. So with the help of the kruve grind size reference i have put together something that I hope will help people with this. \n\nTools needed: some measuring device, ruler, tape measure, hopefully something that has 1/16 marks. If it only has 1/8ths just divide it in half with a mark.¬† \n\nOn the measure device \n1/16th = .062 in./1600 microns \n1/32nd = .031 in./800 microns \n\nPour over range simplified \nMed. Course 1100 microns - .044 in.\nMed.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 900 microns -¬† .035 in.\nMed. Fine.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 700 microns -¬† .028 in. \n\nWith this info. You will see a medium course grind will be closer to 3/4 of the 1/16 mark, and the medium fine grind will be just under half of 1/16. I hope this makes some sense.",
