        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/3nzdg0/golliwog_apologia_xpost_from_rbadhistory/",
        "text": "At the suggestion of a commenter, I decided to cross-post this here. The bad history (with a heavy dose of bad linguistics) is this following account of the origins of the 'golliwog'. I would post a link to it but I can't find the origin of it, and it tends to appear everywhere from the Herald Sun to Stormfront. If anyone can find the original author of it, though, I will happily credit them.\n\n&gt;The origins of the Golliwog began with the British soldiers who occupied Egypt near the end of the nineteenth century. The Egyptian labourers working for the British wore the letters W.O.G.S. on their armbands, indicating that they were Working On Government Service. These labourers were spoken of as Ghuls – the Arabic word for desert ghost – by the British troops. The children of the Egyptians played with black stuffed material dolls. These dolls in turn were given as gifts or purchased by the soldiers returning home to England. These dolls became known as Ghuliwogs, a name which would eventually become the Golliwog we know today.\n\nFirstly, the folk-etymology backronym! Famous from such imaginary word-histories as '[Fornicating Under Consent of the King](http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/fuck.asp)' and '[Port Out, Starboard Home](http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/posh.asp)', it is a common way of making up the origin of a word because it only has to sound vaguely reasonable for people to swallow it. Very few words actually come about this way, though – the exceptions tend to be technical words like '[laser](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Laser#/Terminology)' or 'radar' – and there is simply no evidence that the racial slur 'wog' originated as an acronym. No arm-bands have been turned up or photographs of workers wearing them. And there is a better alternative to this fanciful etymology, which I'll get to later.\n\nWhoever authored this deserves points for doubling-down on the 'make up something which sounds like it could be true and then assert it as if it is' tactic, though. 'Ghul' is indeed an Arabic word, which essentially means 'ghoul', and if you're attempting to reverse engineer a plausible origin for a word then it makes sense to use nouns for your source material. Again, though, the problem is a lack of evidence when there is a better explanation available – tellingly, when you perform an [Ngram search](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=golliwog%2Cghuliwog%2CGhuliwog%2CGolliwogg%2CGolliwog&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=1&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cgolliwog%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CGolliwogg%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CGolliwog%3B%2Cc0) on 'ghuliwog' or 'Ghuliwog' the word doesn't turn up at all, suggesting it wasn't used in print whatsoever, even as the terms 'golliwog' and 'Golliwogg' were thriving.\n\nAs far as I can tell, [this](http://i.imgur.com/GFvGj21.png) is the original golliwog from Florence K. Upton's *[The Adventures of two Dutch Dolls and a \"Golliwogg\"](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16770/16770-h/16770-h.htm)*, first published in 1895. Note how \"Golliwogg\" (so spelled) is thrown in quotation marks, as if the word wasn't already in use at the time. Also note how similar the doll is to earlier blackface depictions of African Americans in the minstrel tradition – coal-black skin, exaggerated, reddened lips, colourful attire with giant bow-ties – which we can find examples of from throughout the nineteenth century, including [1832](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Jimcrow.jpg?1444308718034), [1844](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Dandy_Jim_from_Caroline.jpg/800px-Dandy_Jim_from_Caroline.jpg?1444308757439), [1875](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/var.0241/), [1890](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/var.1790/), [1892](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/var.1792/), [1899](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3g10477/) and [1900](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/var.1828/). Rather than being developed from Egyptian cloth dolls, it seems golliwogs were based upon popular illustrations of African Americans from the United States – which Upton encountered from her upbringing in New York and subsequently brought to Britain.\n\nAs for the term 'golliwog' itself, it seems it was mostly a made-up word, as Upton claims, but was possibly based on the existing slang-word 'pollywog' (tadpole). This is the Pokemon approach to making up fictional names. Take an existing word and just adapt it slightly – i.e. Diglett/piglet, Squirtle/turtle and, appropriately enough, [Poliwag](http://pokemondb.net/pokedex/poliwag)/pollywog. (Bringing things full circle there is also, of course, a blackface Pokemon. It is called [Jynx](http://pokemondb.net/pokedex/jynx).) The golliwogs books went on to be quite popular, eventually becoming characters in Enid Blyton's Noddy books, and it was likely from this popularity that the word was adapted into a racial slur. That is, 'wog' came from 'golliwog', and not the other way round.\n\nIt is understandable why people leap to invent innocent histories for things like golliwogs. They are a cherished children's toy, and we want golliwogs to be innocent in the same way we want to remember our childhoods as being innocent. The alternative is to admit that they are tainted by a difficult past, and that we should abandon them if we care about doing away with racism. But as much as I sympathise with not wanting to let go of something you cherished as a child – I recently rediscovered my old Lego catalogues, and couldn't bring myself to throw them all out – it's important not to rewrite the past in order to pretend that blatant racism wasn't, well, blatant racism.

I'm fairly certain someone has at some point started a statement \"As a... professor of linguistics who has studied this exact phenomenon in detail\" or similar, and thus made it clear where their authority is actually coming from.",

Is that not right? Do the people here just 100% reject Sapir-Whorf and think that thought influences language, but that the relationship is not a two-way street? I feel that language surely influences thought-- it doesn't *determine* it by any means, but I don't really see how the idea that \"language influences thought\" is even radical. \n\nIs it just \"trendy\" to reject Sapir-Whorf in this particular sub? I'm a little confused about why it's hated on so much. Is there something wrong with it that I'm missing?\n\nI know historically, linguistic relativity was treated more like an axiom than a hypothesis, which is perhaps why people are reacting so negatively to it now. I also know that there have been bad studies presented as evidence of linguistic relativity that have proven to be incorrect. For example, the idea that the Inuit have tons of words for snow because they have to deal with snow all the time was once used as evidence for linguistic relativity. But that situation was just the researcher not understanding verb conjugations-- what the researcher thought were many words were different verb forms of the same word. So that's not evidence of linguistic relativity, sure, but that's still not proof of linguistic relativity being false. That situation is just not evidence of it being true. \n\nPlease help me understand! Whenever I am on this sub, I have this sinking feeling like I am radically misunderstanding something.

        "text": "Some background: Bastian Sick is a German Internet columnist who writes about the German language. He is such a big source of badling that [somebody wrote a whole book about it](http://www.amazon.de/Streifzug-durch-Sprache-Antwort-%C2%BBZwiebelfisch%C2%AB/dp/3865990479). However, more importantly for this particular piece of badling, he is also a Romance philologist, making [his garbled explanation for why the German *Imperfekt* was renamed *Präteritum*](http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/zwiebelfisch/zwiebelfisch-abc-imperfekt-praeteritum-a-344448.html) just incredible:\n\n&gt; Imperfect and preterite — two different terms for the same past tense? Isn’t our grammar complicated enough? Why do we need two (foreign) words to refer to the same tense? Or is there a difference after all? The entry on “imperfect” in most reference books refers to “preterite.” The latter is the nowadays more common technical term for what in German is called “erste Vergangenheit” (“first past”). German linguistics was strongly influenced by French philology — which is where the term “imperfect” (fr. “imparfait”) comes from, because French distinguishes between simple past (passé simple) and the unfinished past imperfect (imparfait). However, this distinction does not exist in German. We have no “passé simple,”^(NOTE: I think he meant to write “imparfait,” otherwise this doesn’t make sense.) only a (first) past tense form. And calling that “imperfect” (that is, “unfinished”) is misleading in the eyes of many German teachers and Germanists, because the past tense form we’re talking about here refers to an event that is completed:\n\n&gt; * Ich ging allein nach Hause. (I went home alone.)\n\n&gt; * Er aß nur einen Happen. (He only had a bite to eat.)\n\n&gt; * Wir warteten auf den Bus. (We waited for the bus.)\n\n&gt; What’s “unfinished” about that?\n\nThis is where the badling starts. His second example is the only one where we can be reasonably sure that the event in question is supposed to be finished. For the other two examples, we need more context. For instance, the first example is only perfect if you are about to tell what happened after you arrived at home. If, however, you describe what happened on your way there, it is imperfect.\n\nIn Italian, for example, the sentence, “I went home alone and had dinner,” would be, “**Andai** a casa da solo e cenai.” “I was going home when I was robbed,” however, would be, “**Andavo** a casa quando fui derubato.”\n\nSimilarly, “We waited for the bus and drove to the city,” would be, “**Aspettammo** l’autobus e andammo in città,” while, “We were waiting for the bus when it began to rain,” would be “**Aspettavamo** l’autobus quando cominciò a piovere.”\n\nYou see, while Bastian Sick is right that German doesn’t have an imperfect tense per se, he fails to see that the aspect of the German preterite can be both imperfect and perfective (perfective meaning that it expresses an event that is finished, but doesn’t have present relevance), which is why it is no longer called “Perfekt.”\n\nMoving on…\n\n&gt; The only way the act could be interpreted as unfinished is if, for example, it took place in a novel.\n\nThis isn’t even wrong.\n\n&gt; If you read, “Harry pulled out his wand,” the act is in no way finished, because this is when it’s getting interesting, and everybody wants to know, “What happened next?”\n\nHe got it completely backwards. What he’s describing here is the exact situation where you would use the *perfect* tense. The imperfect tense would only be correct if the author were about to describe what happened while Harry was pulling out his wand.\n\nAfter this, Bastian Sick goes on to explain the difference between the preterite and the perfect tense, which is that the preterite doesn’t have present relevance (as I explained above), while the perfect tense does. That’s not really badling, so I’ll stop here. I only hope my explanation made sense.",
