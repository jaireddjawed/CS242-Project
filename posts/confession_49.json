        "text": "When I was a freshman in High School, there was a vending machine outside the entrance of the swimming pool lockers rooms. This was basically the ‚Äúother end‚Äù of the building, where the woods classes, gym, field house, and pool were all located. There weren‚Äôt crowds of people passing in these hallways all the time, and if there was, it was the people going to a woods class. The vending machine was around the corner of that hallway. I was also on the cross country team, and this was the place where we gathered to get on the bus to go to a meet. Eventually, we found out that this vending machine had a broken security flap. This is the little thing that blocks the inside of the machine when you push it open to get your whatever. We thought we should try and see if we could reach the inside, so I volunteered since I had the skinniest arm. When I got on my knees to put my arm in, everyone circled around me to block me from the camera that was literally pointing down on the vending machine. Our logic was that if they couldn‚Äôt see me doing anything, I couldn‚Äôt get in trouble. Believe it or not though, I could reach the entire bottom two rows. Fruits snacks, cookies, candy bars and gum were all in my reach, and not just one of each. I was pulling from the back of the pushers too. But don‚Äôt get me wrong, that shit hurt like bitch. My forearm was red and my bone hurt. But I still kept doing it for 5 months. I was so good, that one time we timed me and I was able to clean out the bottom row in 9 seconds. I got the idea to start selling to anybody for 50¬¢ under for each item, and I made well over $900. The only pain was having to wait for the guy to come on Tuesdays and Thursdays to refill the machine. Every time I went though, I always made sure to have people with me to hide me from that damn camera. 5 months went, and I‚Äôm wondering to myself that there is no way the people watching the cameras are that stupid. You see a guy get under the vending machine and people crowding around him, and that‚Äôs not suspicious at all? Now I‚Äôm thinking that the camera might not even work. So one day I ended up getting a little greedy, and just went by myself to get snacks. Well waddya know. I get called down to the deans office a couple days later and got in-school suspension for 2 days.\n\nSo remember: Your worst enemy is your own self.",

        "text": "English is not my first language, I'm better at reading than forming it. So please be kind with me. \n\nThere was a rumour that a person in my school (I'll call him Liam) had done inappropriate things to a girl at a party one weekend whilst trying to get a threesome. I don't like to listen to gossip, but from the bits that were told to me, some believed it was true and others didn't. \n\nI barely knew Liam when all of this came out, but I decided to keep it in my mind but not be judgemental of it. He was already left out from the people at our school after it, so I didn't start hating the guy when none of us really knew what happened. \n\nFast forward a year later and the rumour died down a bit. Liam was becoming more friends with people again and I think a lot more people thought the girl had lied or over exaggerated about the party. \n\nAt this point I spoke to Liam a bit in our maths class because we sat near each other. I don't remember how the conversation came up but we got onto the rumours that had been shared about him. He asked me what I had been told about it, and I was honest telling him that people had said he had been inappropriate with the girl. \n\nI still remember how he responded about this because the way he said it was so cold and relaxed. He said it like he was just talking about an old unimportant memory. Without looking up from his phone he just said to me \"she's so dramatic. All I did was touch her bra straps\". \n\nNow I've been on the fence about this. But to me this would be very inappropriate. If I was in a bar or party and was deliberately touching a women's bra or trying to take it off her, then it would be inappropriate. So to me he admitted the rumour was true. \n\nYou may think I am an awful person but this conversation took place two years ago and we are no longer in school now. I've never told anyone of this conversation and don't know if I should reach out to people and say that I know it happened because Liam told me or leave it behind with school. Part of me feels guilty because I think some of the people thinks the girl lied, when I know she didn't. But part of me wonders whether it was worth telling people about this, or if I'd just be bringing up the past when everyone has now moved on.\n\nBut I still feel sick some nights thinking about it and I don't know why he would be so blunt about telling me and why I didn't tell someone. Maybe I was thinking that people wouldn't care, or that Liam would just say it didn't happen. But I now have to live with that.",

When we were walking I suddenly get an urge to poo and I said that i can hold it until we come to the zoo, but no I needed to go to a toilet so bad, the we finnaly arrived. I buu my ticket and rush to the WC, there was only one toiilet wich was occupied by some man. I was waiting but couldn't hold it any longer so i did what a 2 yer old would do (shit his pants), and then he finally finished and I went in and i juts threw my boxers in the toilet and ran out. When i got to my friends they said I smelled like shit and I went with a quick stupid lie that there was a shit on the floor next to the toilet and that i stepped in it, they were a bit sceptical about my stpry but they belived me. So we went on with the zoo trip and I find a water fountain and I take a bit of water and put it under my shorts and brown water came out. I don't think I talked to my friends that whole trip because of my smell.",

        "text": "When I was ten, I was sent to a lyceum with accommodation for two years. I was at home only for summer and winter holidays (winter holidays lasted one month). I didn't communicate at all (I didn't want to suffer after losing friends). I was supposed to spend only one year there. No one asked me about my sophomore year. Everyone ignored my opinion and sent me to the lyceum. All this time I was hoping that my mother would support me, because I didn't communicate with my peers. She gave up on me and went about her business. Maybe she hasn't called me in months. During this time, I have become very distant from her and society. I learned to do everything alone. Solve problems alone. Have fun alone. I have a strong childhood grudge against my mother. I don't want to talk to her about that time. Now she's trying to take care of me. I try not to offend her, but I block her anxiety and attempts to get closer. Her friends say I shouldn't do it. But in these two years I have learned to cope with everything without her.\n\nIf I think objectively, then I'm not doing anything wrong. But she's my mom and I think I should give her a chance. It's really hard for me to forgive her (she is unaware of her guilt). I think I'm to blame for her.\n\nYes, I am a child. I'm only twelve now. But I consider myself an adult and fully formed person. I understand quite serious topics better than some adults.",
