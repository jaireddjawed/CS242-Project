For example this article https://abacusdata.ca/canadian-politics-july-2022-2/ states that 51% of Canadians view Justin Trudeau negatively. Can someone please explain to me the reasons behind the backlash against the PM? I'd love to understand the situation better. Thank you in advance!",

Steven himself is wondering if there's a joke he's missing, and in the comments people were talking about it but no one actually gave an explanation.\n\nI tried Google but all I see are more GUCCI x Peppa prints on clothing with different designs being sold as actual products and people asking for authenticity. There's even one variant with the U of GUCCI printed upside down and some claiming it's the original design.\n\nNow, I'm thinking that the joke is the product itself and people on the internet pretending to identify which ones are original or fake, but I also won't be surprised if something this ridiculous is an actual thing, because fashion.",
