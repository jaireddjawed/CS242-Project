        "text": "The 90s nostalgia everywhere has been hurling me back to my youth recently, and memories of the 00s, being 15 and painfully awkward, Dance Dance blasting at a school hall disco, when From Under the Cork Tree was brand new and everyone was emo so Panic! had our teen hearts beating faster, faster, well those memories still carry on; the world never took my heart, it went and tried and didn‚Äôt break me, so listen here, if it‚Äôs who you are: meet me¬†[at the NX for Emo Night Newcastle](https://www.fatsoma.com/e/xyttv2jw/emo-night-newcastle)! I‚Äôm going alone, my old friends all scattered across the globe now or sucked into the vortex of Londinium (no hate, just understanding, lived there, love and miss it, so I remember how easy it is to go in and never come out). I miss dancing together when no one is judging and everyone is bleeding their hearts out through their liberated skin, laughing so hard the neighbours bang on the wall because it‚Äôs late and they can‚Äôt sleep but they‚Äôre not mad because they know what it‚Äôs like to be fully alive and loving it, talking about everything all night long as long as it‚Äôs true and scary and beautiful and painful and magical, crashing in piles of whatever soft things are around, waking together in the same room in a warm daze, brewing the tea, smoking a joint, companionably tidying up, clearing our heads with a walk in the park and a full Turkish breakfast the late morning after. Invite me to your warm and cosy after-party! I want to play We‚Äôre Not Really Strangers and wear our hearts on our sleeves because everyone is kind and brave and we‚Äôre all safe to show our scars. Are you a fiercely loyal pack willing to take in one more lone stray? I won‚Äôt go down by myself, but I‚Äôll go down with my friends! Are you still a lonely emo boy on the inside, longing for a best friend and sister to trust with all your tender excitable heart? I want to be there with open arms!¬†Are you that girl grown up who always felt it all and never said enough, Anne with an E on the inside, singing every word of a Jimmy Eat World record and dreaming of a bosom friend? Me too! And I know, I‚Äôm not your friend, I‚Äôm not your lover, I‚Äôm not your family, I‚Äôm just a woman who knows how to feel ‚Äî the highs and the lows, I love all the feelings in life, just as long as we feel them with everything in us. Time to get the seeds into the cold ground! It takes a while to grow anything, I know, and I like that.¬†I love growing together! Say hullo if you want a friend, even if you can‚Äôt come to emo night: I prefer dancing at home or outdoors on adventures anyway üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n(And anyone who feels the pressure of first impressions or not knowing exactly how to say what you want to say when you know you want to reach out, any of that social anxiety or too-many-things-going-on paralysis, just send me some emojis or emo lyrics to show your interest (and your self)!
