        "text": "Hi guys, I have a couple more questions about pan sauces in general after my latest attempt.\n\nOne, is it okay to use cast iron for this? I don't have an 'oven-safe stainless steel skillet' like what it calls for in the recipe, and it seems like it requires pretty fast temperature adjustments. If it's not, can anyone point me to somewhere where I can get one?  Putting 'oven safe skillet' into Amazon is just getting me entire sets.\n\nTwo, how do you know when it's reduced enough? The recipe says '[until 2/3 reduced](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/04/easy-pan-roasted-chicken-breast-lemon-rosemary-pan-sauce-recipe.html)', but that's really difficult to tell when you're using a wide pan (like my 12 inch cast iron) and on top of that, times aren't super accurate either with how stove output differs. For me, the general rule of thumb was \"when it's thick enough to hold for a moment as you draw a spoon through it\", but I've always thought that the butter that you add at the end contributed more to that than reducing did.\n\nThanks for your help.",

I can't even practice first! :)\n\nI've rented a large charcoal and electric rotisserie thing designed for pig roasts. The butcher is nice enough to give me a hog at cost + $50 - And he's even going to have it ready on the spit. All i need to do is set it up and cook it. \n\nThe parts that i'm worried about are how to monitor temps and how to carve it - and would love any advice/links/videos/books which any of with experience might have. Should i just cook it to 180F by regularly checking the shoulder/hams with a thermapen? Should i mount a thermometer + probe on the spit?\n\nWhat about carving it? Did any of you learn how to do this via youtube/books/websites? Do you know of *good* guides or resources for someone who has never done this before?....Or should i turn it all into pulled pork?\n\nI am searching and watching, but thought someone here may have some bookmarked directions/info that would save me a bit of searching.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

I've done the tortillas like he describes before, but I simply won't have the time to do them by hand for the 30ish people. Anyone have a good method to mass prepare a giant stack corn tortillas?\n\nI was thinking of layering them with some damp paper towels or cloth napkins and microwaving them.\n\n\nEDIT: Followup - Dutch Oven was pretty much a total failure. Tortillas worked but a lot were crumbly, as people below suggested they might be. Next time I will try the grilling approach.",
