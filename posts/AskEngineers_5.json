I live on long island and I see the frost line is 36\".  I recently came across a drawing from a pergola kit company and it says that there's a few different ways to install the foundation.\n\nMy question is with a \"spread foundation\" is the depth just to the frost line?\n\nAnd also, can I pour a foundation on top of the foundation they poured? Then drill in achor screws? I'm ASSuming that the frostline only pertains to the ground soil and not above ground since there's no soil to freeze? The second foundation I'm thinking of pouring would be surrounded by cambridge retaining wall stone.  I believe it's 36\" above ground.\n\nThe engineering drawing that was sent to me states 3'6x3'6 square with 3 #5 rebar each way. No depth specified but if you go by scale, it would be 22\" deep.",

Then, this solution is heated again so that the added element can form precipitates in the host element. Then it’s cooled again. My questions are: 1. How does the solution look in the beginning? Is it e.g a slab of aluminium being heated next to a smaller slab of copper? Are they first forged together? 2: I don’t really understand the concept of equilibrium (even though I’ve had thermodynamics) and how it relates to meta stable phases and in turn to hardness. I suppose the atoms of the second element move between dislocations (smaller atoms above dislocation, larger atoms under dislocation). But this still doesn’t explain the concept of the solution falling in and out of equilibrium and forming precipitates. Thank you in advance.",

        "text": "To be clear, I'm talking about [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USAn1Lp-d4I/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nI understand that we don't want a straight section because the centre takes more moment than the tips. The tips basically support nothing, so they should be small. We want to reduce self weight and weight at the tips creates a lot of moment on the central support.\n\nBut if we assume the load on the top of the bridge is uniform, or at least we're designing all parts to be equal in strength, we can design according to a simple uniformly distributed load, and the bending moment diagram for that is a convex curve. Don't we want each part of the support to hold up that amount of bending moment? Then shouldn't the shape be convex? I also see some old bridges, from when manufacturing wasn't so good, be mostly straight and then taper off at the tips, forming kind of a trapezium, and that trapezium is like a low poly approximation of this convex shape. I also found [this picture](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Single-pier-bridge_fig3_283508921) that shows both concave and convex sections in the same application.\n\nWhat gives? What's the advantage of one over the other? If we're going to go through the trouble of making a curved form, how is it that the optimisation process can produce two opposite results? And if both the thing with the self weight far from the column and the thing about the bending moment diagram are valid, wouldn't they more or less cancel out and the best section is like a simple triangle like what you'd see in a gusset?",

When we reach the highest temperature we can, we direct the pipeline sideways, and then upwards to the surface. \n\nIn that system we could pump water on one end - it would turn into steam after the 100-200 Celcius temperatures - and when the steam is deep down, it would be heated up to the point of superheated steam. At this point it would start it's way out at the very high temperatures. \n\nThink of it as 1 giant pipeline in the shape of letter \"U\". The water turns into steam at one vertical part of the \"U\", at the bottom part it's heated to the supercritical state, and then it goes upwards through the other vertical part of the \"U\". \n\nI imagine that the engineering part is the biggest problem - how do we install a pipeline system in 400+ Celcius (752 Fahrenheit) temperatures? But if we somehow find a way to do it, could a system like this work from a pure physics point of view?",

        "text": "What’s up y’all. I have a kinda long explanation for a simple problem it’s just had me stumped for a few weeks and I haven’t come up with a solution, so here we go. I’m a small at home cannabis grower and I’m trying to build a new automatic irrigation system with more precision and less maintenance than the previous. First I’ll explain my previous system and what sucked about it. I used a small aquarium submersible pump with 3/4” pvc in a 55gal brute trash can. Than went to my tray in my tent and to 2 manifolds with 8 barbs for drip tubing, and then the tubing going to stakes in my pots; 2 stakes per plant. So obviously for equal watering plant to plant there is typically a recommended psi by the manufacturer of the tubing/stakes and it’s usually around 25psi. I negatives about this setup: \n1) submersible pump leaves about 6” or 5gals of expensive nutrient water in the bottom. I’d have to disconnect the union, remove the pumps, and then I have to drag that heavy garbage can to my sump to dump 5gals of expensive nutrient water while making a a mess \n2) submersible pumps get gunked up need lots of maintenance\n3) different flow rates when water in reservoir is at different levels: not ideal as I’d prefer to be able to determine feed volumes while comparing to runoff volumes\n\nSo, with all of that being said, here the issue that I’m having now. I cannot find a pump of any kind that is small enough to fill the needs of my flow rate. All I’ll have is 10 drippers (2/plant) likely able to release .5gph as that’s the standard with 25psi compensating emitters plugged directly into my polyethylene tubing in my tent. So basically I need a 10gph pump. Specifically I’d like to use a diaphragm pump and mount it to the wall outside of the tent and use a suction tube going all the way to the bottom of my reservoir to be able to empty it completely. Another thought I had was to add a tee and valve going straight to my sump so that I can just run my pump while I’m washing the reservoir out and run fresh water thought the pump w while also automatically draining it. Just can’t find a pump that can do it. I’ve looked at small chemical metering pumps as they do tell you how many mL you’re giving and can set them on intervals but I don’t think any of them have the pressure I’d need to have consistent feeds. So yeah I’m at a loss for now I really don’t want to use that submersible pump again. I’m slightly familiar with solenoids and getting some sort of irrigation controller using those could be an option as well but I first need to solve my pump issue. I have a lot of faith i this group and thank you in advance to anyone who actually took the time to read this mess. ✌🏼",
