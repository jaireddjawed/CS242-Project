        "text": "I typed this long-ass story here once, and my app crashed and deleted it. Let me try again.\n\nI've been browsing this subreddit for fun, and remembered one of these situations happened to me. I think it's exactly the kind of thing y'all are interested in.\n\nI was 15, in high school. School sucked a lot, so I would skip days if I didn't feel up to a day of class. One Monday, i skip school and waste the day watching Baby Looney Tunes and playing Pokemon.\n\nThe next day, I go to school.\n\nIn the hangout time before first period, i ask my friend Ethan if he missed me. \"What?,\" he replies. I explain I was gone the previous day. He tells me that not only did I speak to him yesterday, but he shook my hand and we exaggerated the handshake, goofing around very characteristically. He even tells me a couple things we talked about, and it was all perfectly plausible. \n\nWeird, but maybe Ethan's lying or misremembering. So i ask Lakeon. She confirms this by saying she hugged me the previous morning. Trent, Brian, Aaron.... everyone confirms.\n\nI was there, they tell me. \n\nI have no idea what happened. It's possible all my friends were kinda shitty, or didn't like me. But I am confident it wasn't a matter of fucking with me intentionally. I remember the looks of horror and confusion when I told them I was out sick. The best part? I didn't have any work to make up. I was too afraid to ask my teachers if they had me marked absent.",

        "text": "Well, its complicated, and I am not sure if this is actually the correct sub. If not please remove this thread.\n\nOkay..well let's see. How do I explain this?\n\nWell, my wife and I were watching some stupid thing on television, she's on her tablet playing some game or another, I am on my phone talking to someone on a forum. I had thought about asking my wife to fix us a drink, the first drink, so I wasn't drunk, and I didn't ask. Within a few minutes, she gets up, vanishes to the kitchen, and returns with mixed drinks. I ask why she decided to do that, and she said I had asked her. I hadn't. I thought about it, but decided to wait til later this afternoon, and didn't bother asking. Hell, its only three in the afternoon.\n\nShe is adamant that I did ask, while I KNOW for a solid fact that I didn't. Is this a glitch, or am I going insane? This has happened a couple times in the past, and I've shrugged it off. Its even happened with the kids.  They have wanted to ask for something while mommy was busy, and instead asked me, because mommy told them to wait til she wasn't busy to talk to her. ( my wife works for an insurance company, and has a small home office, often she works from home, this was the case on the day in question.)  They came to me, asked me, and I told them to go play. They hadn't actually talked to my wife yet. When she was finished with her phone call, she told me that yes they could go to their cousins for the weekend. They asked me while we were out side, far away from the office. I heard them say to their mother that 'we want to ask you something' and heard her tell them to wait. That's when we went out. Then they ask me, I'm like ' well, wait for mommy, cause I don't want her to think I'm working against her' ( an inside joke in the family) . I then went inside to grab something, and that's when she told me yeah to tell them they could go. I asked his she knew what they wanted, and again she insisted that they had asked. \n\nThat example could have been explained, had we talked to the parents or the cousins. We hadn't in days. It wasn't a plan for them to go, it was a spur of the moment thing that my daughter and youngest son decided they wanted to go.\n\nThere are several instances similar to this, and its not like she a fuckin psychic. Its just random things like that. I know she isn't reading our minds, because this isn't a movie. I don't believe in shit like that. None of us do.  But something is happening.  What do y'all think???\n",

        "text": "Recently I spent a week in Oxford, on an educational trip. I was staying in one of Oxford universities many collages. The minute I got to Oxford, things seemed off. I'd check the time, and almost moments later it'd have skipped five minutes or so. Fast forward to the first night, when I went to bed, I lay there for what felt like an hour. I swear to God it was an hour. I hadn't long checked my oh one, and it was a few minutes to eleven. I recheck my phone, and it was half four in the morning. It happened quite often throughout the week, time seeming to skip by. It stopped when I left Oxford. I don't know, maybe this was just me being weird? There was so much dejavu you'd have thought I'd have been to Oxford before, and I lost things which, though irrelevant, the places I put them in... they shouldn't have gone missing. I'm talking in my rucksack, in the small zip up pocket. I took my rucksack everywhere, it never left me, unless I left it in my locked room. The rain one night was odd too. If you've ever played minecraft, and looked up while it was raining, it was like that. The rain above me stopped, and the rest seemed to slow and fall directly above each other. I had looked up at the sky to see a plane and the rain thing happened. \n\nI don't know. Maybe it's just me. It's stopped since I've left Oxford. ",

And it's not like I only forgot bits of my day yesterday, it's more like I have no recollection of my day at all. I've done some research and I've found a few people on the Reddit community mention that they've somehow skipped a few hours of their lives, but never a whole day.

        "text": "I want to preface this by saying I've heard the album Ok Computer by Radiohead countless times before so I'm sure I wasn't just hearing things, but who knows. \nThe other day I was listening to pandora when the track No Surprises came on. At first I didn't recognize it; the only way I can explain it is it sounded more shallow and distant. More specifically, I had no recollection of the part at the very beginning. Thinking it was an updated version or remaster or something, I then went to YouTube and iTunes to hear the version I was familiar with, but the song still sounded way off to me. I played a few other tracks on the album, and most of them sounded just slightly off. To specify, the beeping at the beginning of Paranoid Android was a whole different sound and Karma Police sounded much instrumentally lighter than I remember. \nI wasn't wearing different headphones or anything and I'm not losing my hearing, so I'm not sure what that was about. \nAnother weird, slightly more recent odd thing relating to that album happened a few weeks ago. \nThe internet at my house was down, and unable to sleep in silence, I played one of the only albums I have on iTunes to fall asleep- Ok Computer. \nNow, in the iTunes app, albums loop once they play through once. \nA specific part of one of the tracks on the album- a particularly loud part I guess- kept waking me up on every loop of the album. It was a heavier guitar part, and I can still remember what it sounded like- a little like  Climbing Up the Walls, but the song I heard wasn't nearly familiar enough to possibly be the same track as that one. \nThe following morning, remembering what kept waking me up, I went into iTunes to find what song it was because I hadn't recognized it at all. \nI thought it was either Lucky or The Tourist, but no part of either of those songs sounded quite like what I'd heard that night. \nIt kind of weirded me out at the time, but it could've just been all in my head. \nAnyway, just curious if anyone has experienced a whole album seemingly shifting in sound, or a hearing a song that probably doesn't exist.

I open the package, and i take ONE out. I set the package down and i dont pick it back up for about two hours. I use the first bar, and when i go to make smores again, i pick up the package and im trying to find the hole i ripped when i took out the first one. There isn't one. Like, the package isn't open. It's completely sealed, and i checked for a solid 10 minutes, passed it to each of my four other friends so they could look, and they couldn't find it either. I even make sure that I actually took the first bar out of that package, and i count how many bars are in there. one, two, three, four, FIVE. THERE ARE ONLY FIVE IN THERE, i took the sixth one out. THIS PACKAGE IS SEALED MAN, IT WASNT OPEN. I was like, maybe it resealed somehow??? but when i go to open it again, the packaging completely ripped very smoothly, like u know when you open a hershey bar, there is NO way that it could have resealed. I have no idea what happened and I'm still sooo confused and just. what the Fuck so i can confirm, A Glitch In The Matrix.",

        "text": "I want to start off by saying this is 100% true. My twin sister and I have spent a great deal of time on Reddit subs, Youtube, and other sites, she's the one who introduced me to parallel universes, glitches in the matrix and unexplainable events to name a few... after countless hours of reading and listening to numerous experiences (over the last year) of people who have gone through things that absolutely have no explanation other than a glitch in the matrix. I believe that what I experienced last Sunday was a glitch in my matrix. I can only speculate as to what caused my sister and I to experience this glitch but I've come to the conclusion that because my sister and I have spent so much time researching these types of phenomenon we somehow attracted this glitch and brought it into our existence. I really can't say for sure but in my mind its the only thing that makes logical sense seeing as she and I have never experienced anything like this before. \n\nNow for the story, it was about 5:50 a.m. on Sunday the 6th of August 2017 my sister and I work at 6:00 a.m. and luckily we're a 7 min drive from work. We live in Utah I don't know how familiar people are with Utah but with most residents being Mormon roads are pretty damn desolate due to a large number of church goers. My sister and I were the only car on the road totally normal. We were about 4 mins into our commute pulling up to a 4 lane intersection traveling northbound the light is yellow and (on Sunday's my sister and I don't really give two shits about stopping at a yellow light since the roads are empty) my sister is driving. She's about to speed through the yellow light that is clearly about to turn red when I spot a damn police car sitting at a red light on the east side of the intersection.I tell my sister to STOP there's a cop at the intersection she puts her foot on the brake and we come to an abrupt stop we breathe a sigh of relief as we know we almost ran that light phew we're good or so we thought. The cop gets a green light (we're still at the red light) he pulls through the intersection he's about 50-60 feet in front of us and oh fuck he pulls to the right-hand side of the road and sits there obviously about to pull us over for coming to an abrupt stop and almost running the light (what you have to understand about Utah is cops are extremely vigilant and pulling people over for the slightest traffic violation is the norm). Once I see the police car pull off to the right-hand side of the road 50-60 feet in front of us I say to my sister \"The cop car just pulled over he's about to stop us\". I kept my eyes on the car freaking out the whole time knowing we're getting pulled over. (We have expired registration so yeah if we get pulled over we're definitely getting a ticket). My sister as worried as me says \"Screw it I'm going to make a right turn instead of going straight and passing the cop car. I tell her no if you turn now it's going to look extremely suspicious. She agrees and begins to drive forward (I'm still watching the police car) as we pass the car I kid you, not the car fucking disappeared! It was just gone. There is no possible way the car could have moved, turned or anything without me or my sister seeing it, it's impossible. I mean I don't even know how to express how freaky and odd this was. \n\nThe story isn't over yet it's about to get a lot weirder. Once we compose ourselves my sister continue driving. (we travel down one road on our way to work its a straight shot from our apartment). By this point, you can imagine our shock and surprise when not 1, not 2 but 3 full grown deer run out in front of our car. My sister slams on the breaks barely missing the deer. My eyes were glued to the road so I know there's no way I missed 3 deer running from my side of the car. We're like what the hell is going on? The deer may as well have materialized out thin air. They vanished as quickly as they appeared. It's Important to clarify that the 8 years I've lived here in Utah I have never once seen a deer on this road or any other road for that matter. I am nowhere near an area where deer frequent. I live in a big city it's almost unheard of to see deer let alone 3. Idk what the hell happened but...this was the craziest thing my sister and I have ever witnessed. Idk if it's relevant but it didn't occur to me until just now, it was light out I could see everything clearly. Needless to say, the whole day felt weird just not right you know? Maybe it was a glitch in matrix maybe it wasn't but nonetheless it was crazy and unexplainable.\n",

Confused I walk to the livingroom no one there either but the door to the outside was was open (we where living in a bungalow at the time) So I walked out looked around no one there either. I actually remember hearing my name in the whispering voice of a girl I went to school with at the time so for some reason I said her name like three times pretty loud, but no reaction. So I went inside closed the door and went back to sleep. \n\nMy parents say they didnt her anything that night, the only unusual thing after that is that my pet turtle died. \n\nTL;DR: my turtle talked to me while dieing in the night or a (10 jear old) girl visited me or I'm hearing ghosts.

        "text": "Hey there! I just found this sub and it's the only place that will appreciate this story so here goes. Now to provide context for the title, believe it or not it is very true. My spouse has been present for most of these incidents so I know I'm not crazy. I don't do it consciously and it doesn't happen frequently but I have reached into my pocket and pulled out two identical lighters where there was only one moments before. Once on vacation MY toothbrush inexplicably became two, so we ended up with three when I'm sure I only packed two. So when this phenomenon happens it drives me crazy as I can't come up with any sane explanation. On the day this story takes place I got a text from my mother in law about a sale going on at a grocery store in our town, five cases of water for $5. When this happens we try to stock up because who can honestly pass up a deal like that when normally a case of 24 water bottles is easily double that. So I read the text and know I have to get over there before they're cleaned out so I tell my spouse and we immediately empty our car trunk and drive over. We park, grab a cart on our way in and walk in to see a sign that says limit two deals per customer and decide ten cases of water is more than plenty to get us through for quite some time. I load ten cases into our cart, get in line and pay for ten cases. The clerk counts ten as well. We walk out to our car and load ten cases into the trunk. We drive home and start taking the water inside the house case by case by case and stack them up next to the door. So it being a normal day I didn't think twice about counting them as we brought them inside, why would I right? Well we finish up and lock the door. Only after I had taken a seat next to my haul did I notice. Eleven cases of water sitting ominously in my living room. I didn't know what to say. I checked the receipt, ten cases. The trunk was empty. I only loaded ten cases of water into the car. How. Why me. As I'm driving myself crazy once again looking for an explanation, my spouse walked by and laughed knowing I had done it again.",

The phone is in another room, so I went to go get it, I put the ramen back on the top of the microwave where I got it from and returned when I saw it was a telemarketer, or whatever it was. The top box of ramen, when I ripped it, was gone. The same amount of ramen was there, the 5 original boxes, including the one I ripped were \"there\". but the rip was gone. I looked around to see if it had been in-between the fridge, or the microwave, or if I somehow took it back to the phone. It was nowhere to be found. Fast forward about 3 days, and it was back on top of the ramen boxes on top of the microwave, where I remember placing it when the phone first rang.\n\nI know that I have had absence seizures before, but this wasn't one of them, because I fully remember being aware of what was happening the whole time.

        "text": "Okay, so let me start off on some basics. I'm a lurker when it comes to this subreddit, and I find all these stories so intriguing. My bf and I pretty much know of all of the famous stories regarding glitches in the matrix, however we are VERY skeptical people. We're always trying to find a logical explanation to every situation. However, this situation last night just did not make sense in any aspect. Here it goes. \n\nSo last night my bf and I (we're gay btw) were watching makeup tutorials in our room on the iMac. We were watching one with a with a girl tutoring how to do a specific look. We watched this video about 5 times. Mind you safari was the only app open on the iMac and this was the only youtube video and the only tab open. We decide to pause the video mid-way, put the iMac to sleep, and then the both of us take a nap with the lights on. This was around 11pm. \n\nAll of a sudden around 2am we both frantically wake up to a loud and clear conversation to what sounded like two men outside our bedroom door in the hallway. They sounded like they were in their mid 20's. Their tone was positive and they sounded like straight jock-like men. (We live in a college town if this paints a picture). Now let me tell you my bf and I were freaking the fuck out. We kept looking back at each other as this conversation was happening, afraid they were going to enter our room. (We don't have any roommates in our 1 bedroom apartment, and our walls are very sound-proof, so it was very obvious to us that it sounded like it was coming from the hallway.) We were both trying to make out what they were saying, but honestly we were both so frozen it was like impossible (i know this sounds so stupid, but it frustrates me that i couldn't have just put myself together to fully hear the conversation.) I do remember a portion of a conversation though, and it went something like: guy 1: \"hahaha yeah lets go in\" guy 2: \"for sure hahaha\". It kind of sounded as if they knew that we knew were could hear them, and it was as if they were fucking with us in a way. This convo happens for about 2 minutes and then all of a sudden the conversation cuts off abruptly mid conversation. All of a sudden our iMac (still asleep, with the display off) starts to play an ad on youtube, then resumes the makeup tutorial. Here's the thing though, the ad was not what we heard in the hallway. This particular ad is an ad we always come across on youtube and are very familiar with it, and are 100% certain it wasnt the voices in the hallway because the people in the ad were completely different in voices, personality, and context. It also wasnt the makeup tutorial we heard in the hallway because it's just one girl talking the entire time. As soon as we hear the iMac playing I run to the iMac and turn it off. I immediately run outside the room and look everywhere, only to find no one. The door was still locked as well (we had a lock on that you can only lock from the inside, so it couldn't have been intruders escaping)\n\nOverall, we both have thought hard, and I mean really hard about this situation and know for a fact it was NOT the extremely familiar ad and familiar youtube video. Youtube also doesn't play 2 different ads back-to-back, and there weren't any other tabs or apps open on the iMac. The voices on the ad were completely different from the voices in the hallway as well. \n\nI know this might sound very skeptical to all of you. I'm posting here because I want to know if anybody has had a similar experience? I'm going to bed now, so I wont be able to respond to comments until tomorrow afternoon. I'd really appreciate it anyone could put in any input. Thanks. ",

Before I start, I have to say that my grandparents' and my parents' house are on the same propriety, so I kinda live in both houses.\n\nIt was Sunday, and in Argentina at least is very common to have lunch with your extended family that day. So, I woke up at my grandpa's house at 12 o'clock, I think. Someone sent me to my house to get some ice because my aunt was coming, so I got dressed and before I went, I saw my brother who was in the pc. I wouldn't say we don't get along, but we fight a lot so I didn't talk to him. \n\nWhen I went to my house, I went to the bathroom first, and it's important to clarify that my parents' bedroom is in the hallway that leads to the bathroom. When I was getting there, I saw my brother crying at my parents' bedroom. I asked to him what happened and he didn't answer, he just cried. When he's like that it's not good to try to confort him, so I just left him alone and finally went to the bathroom. Also it's important so say he had a large pillow that covered half of his face, like he didn't want me to know he was crying. \n\nI don't know why, but I felt weird so I took the ice and ran to my grandparents'. When I arrived, I saw him in the computer like he never left. He didn't look like he was crying, which creeped me out, but I still asked him what was wrong. He seemed confused as he told me he never left, and my grandma heard the conversation and also confirmed what he said. \n\nThat's when I realized that I should have crossed paths with him as I was going to my house, because you can't enter trough the front door without a key (I went trough the backyard). \n\nSorry if this isn't too clear, English isn't my first language. \n\nSo, what do you think ? To this day no one believes what I saw, but I could swear it was him! ",

When I was 11 I wasn't doing much more online than playing Neopets. I certainly wasn't discussing books with people. \n\nI know it was this book I was discussing because someone had a signature involving Draco being turned into a ferret, and many people didn't understand it because they hadn't read that far yet. If I was simply remembering the movie coming out, then so many people wouldn't have been confused about the ferret bit. \n\nI accept my memory can't be correct, but it does confuse me and feels a tad creepy.\n\n",

In the dream, my boyfriend casually struck up a conversation with her and I was begging to go, pulling on his arm desperately trying to tear him away from the other me. \n\nI woke up and didn't think much of it, just another strange dream. I didn't talk to my boyfriend about it. \n\nThen at breakfast he started telling me about the \"weird\" dream he had. He dreamt that we were walking down that same street and ran into the \"me\" with face paint. And in his dream he started to talk to her, but I began frantically pulling on his arm, begging him to go. \n\nIt was the same dream from the \"right\" perspectives, and we can't think of any shared experience that would have prompted us both to dream that at the same time.

        "text": "I posted this in another sub but I think this place is a better fit.\n\n\nI'd like you to know that keeping things short is not my forte. Shortcuts make for incomplete stories. I hate incomplete stories. However, a TL;DR will be available for you at the bottom anyway. \n\n\nI feel like I'm going insane. But I can't tell too many of the people around me about what's going on with me because they'll think I'm crazy and imagining things the way that I want them to be. The five people that do know believe me though.  \n\n\nMaybe you will believe me too. If not, that's fine. I'm mostly writing this out so that I can come back to it later to prove my sanity to myself. \n\n\nEverything that is happening to me right now is the result of the un-smoothest attempt to slide in another woman's DM's that I have ever gone through with. Ladies and gentlemen, it was horrible. \n\n\nI used to play sports in college. This was almost 10 years ago (that fucking sucks to think about). I was very good at a particular sport. I was the calmest most hot headed player you could find. I was a perfect attitude mix between Tim Duncan and Ron Artest in a female body. Take that how you want. Anyway, we had a game at an opposing school one day. During this game, we were losing. We were losing horribly. And I was playing horribly. Cue the Artest attitude. Curse words were flying. Tensions were high. I was ready to get back on the bus and go back to school. No seriously. Fuck that game. \n\n\nDuring this game, there were cheerleaders. These cheerleaders capitalized on my horrible game. The cheers went from being for their team to being against me in particular. And it was all led by one cheer terrorist. She didn't let up the whole game. We lost. I went home frustrated. And curious. \n\n\nSo my curiosity led me to do the only thing 18 year old me knew how to do; I looked her up on her school's website then proceeded to find and friend her on Facebook. Nothing creepy at all about that, I know. \n\n\nA few months pass and DING! - \"Cute little cheerleader that made your life a living hell for 40+ minutes\" has accepted your friend request! \n\n\nShit. \n\n\nI forgot all about her at this point. I wasn't as prepared for this as I thought I was. So I just kept moving with life. You know, homework and shit. \n\n\nDING! - You have a new message from  \"Cute little cheerleader that made your life a living hell for 40+ minutes\" !\n\n\nFuck me. \n\n\nI REALLY wasn't prepared for her to message me! What was I supposed to do?! Open it?! No. I wasn't going to open that!\n\n\nI opened it. \n\n\n\"Hey, do we know each other?\" \n\n\nInsert biggest face palm in history riiiiight here. \n\n\nI felt like it all was about to backfire on me right in this moment. No, we didn't know each other. I just was on a power trip, looked for you when I got back to school, saw that you were cuter than I remember, and added you because you were fucking attractive and because you pissed me off during the game. \n\n\nCould I tell her that? Absolutely not. If you said yes, what is wrong with you?! I was 18 with no game at all getting messaged by the cutest girl I'd seen to date. Way to try to set me up for failure lol\n\n\nSo I didn't tell her that. I made up some bullshit and cleared myself from all possible wrong. I wiped the invisible sweat from my brow and we kept talking. \n\n\nWe talked briefly. Texting is my thing and it didn't seem like hers. I'm not much of a phone talker because I think it's kind of weird. And we couldn't see each other because our schools were so far apart. Our conversation was shotty because we were busy with our different schedules. Or so I thought. Keep this in mind. \n\n\nThe very next year, we saw each other again. Same situation as the first time we'd met. Except this time, we knew exactly who the other one was. We lost again (I know, shut up lol), I took my shower and headed to the bus to head back to school. The moment I stepped foot on the bus, I heard someone call my name. I didn't recognize the voice. It was her backed by some of her fellow cheer terrorists. Mind you, I've never actually heard her speak. Caught by surprise, I turned around and got back off the bus to go greet her. \n\n\nWhen I got off the bus, my team jumped in the window to watch like annoying little siblings watching from the house window. She gave me a hug, told me that I had a good game anyway, and to text her on the ride back to school. She hugged me again and turned and basically ran away (I figured out later that she ran because she was about to become a member of a sorority and was short on time. This is a different story in itself.) \n\n\nWhen I got back on the bus, we texted for a bit. She sent a nude. I said thanks (don't judge me) and that was it. No more communication with \"Cute little cheerleader that made my life a living hell for 40+ minutes\". This was mid 2009. \n\n\nSlight but VERY important intermission. Here comes the \"this is about to sound crazy as fuck to you and I'm about so sound even crazier\" part. Ready? I've always been a very vivid dreamer. My dreams are always colorful and rhythmic. As I've gotten older, I'm realizing that my dreams are becoming more forth telling. For those of you that need me to break it down even further; I see shit before it happens. Some shit. And I usually don't see it exactly how it'll happen. However, I do see the essence of the situation itself. I feel the emotions that will be present when it happens. I know these dreams are different from the random dreams that I have because I actually remember the details about them. I always remember how I felt, who was present, an idea of what the scene will sort of be like, etc. And it usually sits with me for the rest of the day while I try to figure out what exactly it means. \n\n\nAnyway. - \"Cute little cheerleader that made my life a living hell for 40+ minutes\"  and I stopped talking mid 2009. Hit your little fast forward button to 2 weeks ago. I'd had a dream on a Wednesday night. \n\n\nIn this dream, I was happy. Happier than I'd ever felt in real life. My family and friends were around. We were on a beach at night looking at the city's skyline laughing and joking while music played. We were all dressed up. I looked great (thanks for asking). And I turn to my right. Do you know who I saw? Damn right. It was \"Cute little cheerleader that made my life a living hell for 40+ minutes\" smiling right back at me enjoying the scene that we were in. Then all of a sudden, the dream turned extremely dark and I'm being chased by one of the women that I used to date. She chased me down the beach. This woman was trying to fucking kill me! Then...I woke up. Scared as hell and confused. Forget that an ex was trying to kill me (because that doesn't seem too far fetched). Why the hell was I marrying someone in my dream that I'd forgotten about for damn near 10 years?!? \n\n\nI shook it off and went to work. There was no point in trying to hurt my brain to figure that shit out. Once I left work, I went home and had a drink with my roommate/ex teammate (she was one of the teammates staring out of the bus window that day). All of sudden, a HUGE explosion happens and all of the power in the neighborhood goes out. So what else is there to do? You guessed it! We kept drinking and talking. \n\n\nAs we were talking, somehow she brings up the game that I've been talking about this whole time. Now as soon as my roommate brought up this game, my mind instantly goes back to the dream that I'd had literally the night before. Mind you, I HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT THIS SCHOOL, THIS GAME, OR THIS GIRL SINCE 2009! And here she is popping back up into my subconscious and conscious life out of nowhere. This was some bullshit that I was not prepared to deal with. Like..ever. But I couldn't tell my roommate. Why? Because she'd think I'm a fucking nutcase who reads into things too much. \n\n\nFinally, the lights come back on and I get ready for bed so that I could go to work the next morning. Before I laid down for bed, liquid courage kicked in and I messaged cheerleader on Facebook not expecting a reply back until the morning. Guess what I got 3 minutes after I hit send? Yup. A reply. \n\n\nEverything is about to go really fast for you because it's been fast as hell for me. Buckle up, mother trucker. \n\n\n* After a quick messaging session, we decide to hang out one day in the future. \n* She gives me her number. Again. \n* I use her number. She informs me that she still had my number saved after all of these years. I still had hers save as well after several contact list cleanses (Not sure why). \n* Days pass and I boldly ask her to come over and hook up before ever making an attempt to go on a date first. I expected a no, obviously. \n* Got a yes (Not sure how). She came over, we hooked up, she told me to text her the next day, she left.  \n* I text her like she told me to the next day, and our conversation is JUST like how it was in 08-09. But when we were face to face, she seemed excited to be around me and willing to talk and all that stuff. Weird. \n* Not much communication has ensued after this. Remember when I said earlier that I thought our conversations were shotty because of our possible communication differences? I see this more clearly now. \n\n\nOk! Almost done, I swear. All that you just read has taken place in the past 2 weeks. Also, in the past 2 weeks, I've felt her around. I know that sounds weird but let me explain. Ever since she left my house, I've felt like she's been close. Not like she's watching me. But like she's not very far. I shrugged it off as paranoia or whatever. I tried not to think much of it.\n\n\nYesterday. Oh yesterday. Yesterday was the day that I began to question my fucking sanity when it comes to these dreams and feelings that have become so powerful. \n\n\nI had a dentist appointment yesterday at 11am. I went to the dentist and decided to stop to get a new shampoo. For whatever reason, I was very adamant about trying a new shampoo yesterday. At first, I was going to stop at Walmart but decided that Walmart was too far. Then, I figured I'd go to the beauty supply store near my home. When I got close to the store, I decided not to stop there because the parking lot is too small and I didn't want to fight to get out of the lot. I finally decided to stop at a drug store. I walked into the drug store and found the shampoo. Suddenly, I had a thought to google more about this shampoo that I made such a fuss about getting. After 5 minutes of Google, I decided to no get the shampoo. Yup. I completely wasted my time. \n\n\nAs I'm walking out of the store, I'm still looking down at my phone. When I got to the doors as they were opening, something in my mind said \"look up\". This voice was clear as fuck. In less than a second, I looked up and back down at my phone. When I looked up, there she was with a friend about to walk through the other set of doors to go into the drug store that I was leaving. In the split second of looking up and back down, I saw her about to look at me which made me look back down even faster (cowardly, I know). I knew it was her. I saw her. I felt it. Neither of us spoke. I saw her. I saw her see me. But she did not see me see her. \n\n\nI came home after I stopped at Burger King to get a Froot Loops shake (it's delicious, btw) I've been dumbfounded ever since. I couldn't figure out why this girl that I've not communicated with for almost 10 years suddenly comes back into my mind which leads her to coming back into my life in whatever way is walking into the same drug store that I was leaving out of at the same time. I'd remembered her mentioning her job. So, you guessed it, I looked that shit up. She works 0.6 miles away from where I live. HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS HAPPEN?! I've moved from the crossroads of America, to the east coast, back to one of the largest cities in the US. Only to have cheerleader work 0.6 miles away from my fucking house! \n\n\nWe live in one of the biggest cities in the US. This shit just doesn't happen. It's like the universe is shoving her in my face now.  I feel crazy but I'm not. I had that checked out years ago. I have work in the morning. I want the dreams and thoughts to just stop and go away. I'm scared to leave my house lol \n\n\nTL;DR - It feels like the girl in my dreams is around in real life more than I'm ready for and it scares the shit out of me because it logically doesn't make sense and all I want is for the dreams to stop and to act like this shit never happened. \n",

I remember playing with Michael one day along with some other kids that were possibly his relatives. They were staying at his house. There was a girl there that looked about the same age as Candi, but did not look like her. I asked Michael who she was and he laughed at me and said it was Candi. They all thought I was joking and they insisted it was her. She insisted. They didn't seem to be joking with me and I really don't think they were. I know I was young, but I swear she was not the same girl. They moved maybe a week or two later and we never saw them again. Has anyone else experienced something similar?",

        "text": "Hey, not a very good glitch. But interesting nonetheless. The other night im laying in bed, on reddit, on my back, when i feel a tickle on my stomach, then in my bra. At first i thought it was just a fruit fly or something, but decided to check in my bra. There was a spider in my bra! Out of reaction and panic, i brought my hand down and mushed the fucker on my chest. Hyperventilating and panicking all the while. After a minute or so of calming down i figure that i should get it out and go make some tea to relax. I lift up my hand and look in my bra to find that stain you usually find when smashing bugs-on my bra. At the same time this happened, i felt another tickle across my chest and i jumped out of bed, declothing and shaking out my hair. Looked all over, and in my clothes, and didnt see any spiders. After recuperating, i decided i should tear my bed apart to find It or worse... THEM... Under my blanket, directly under where my back should be, there was the crumpled up little 8 legged spawn of satan. I grabbed my phone to take a picture to send my girlfriend, and as im taking it i see it revive and slowly crawl towards my pillow (mind you my blanket is at the foot of my bed from checking for it in the first place and after shaking it out) so, logically, i move my pillow out of the way to find the injured spider, but it wasnt there! I thought maybe it was IN the pillow case or between the mattress and the wall. So i proceeded to take my pillows out of their cases, and take apart my whole bed to find it was gone. As a last ditch effort in finding it, i shake out my blanket once again that was at the foot of my bed, to find the bastard running for cover, only to get mushed by an empty cup. when you're terrified of bugs/spiders especially, youre hyper alert and focused and Im sure i didnt take my eyes off my bed long enough for it to have moved that far across my bed, into my blanket. I also feared the idea that there maybe more than one *shivers* but with as thorough as i was finding it, im sure there werent any more in my bed or anywhere around it... So yeah. Look out. Spiders gained the ability to teleport! Check your sheets!!!",

This usually lasted from 20 seconds to 3 minutes. (I also think I couldn't remember those memories again as soon as the episode ended - but I'm not sure as all of this happened several years ago.)\n\nIt happened quite frequently back then, once or twice a week, sometimes with a bit more time in between. \n\nNow I didn't think much of it back then, but some years ago I remembered this and I did some research on the internet, and I found that other people'd had this as well. \n\nInternet doctors (lol) described this as anxiety-related disorders, but I assure you this was not the case and even if I might've been anxious (which I'm quite sure of that I wasn't) - it sure as hell wasn't what triggered these things.

But i still need an answer.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure whether share this or not but here I go. \n\nIt was in June when me and my friends noticed something weird happening. First it was a blackout in home when we were about to leave the house. Then rain started as if keeping us at home was planned. But we didn't stop and keep walking for the far bus stop even though we could have taken the close one. On our way, a lady with 2 kids asked time and we told her while we were trying to get across the street. At that time, I felt something so different. Like a milestone was coming or I don't know. I told my friends \"I think something has just changed.\" They felt that too. \n\nWe kept moving regardless rain. Then I looked up at sky. It was almost down, but where we stopped was brighted upon us. Black clouds were around us. We went to bus stop and waited for a bit because we all were feeling uneasy about the situation. Maybe it was nothing but our imagination but it didn't make us better. Then the street lights were off too. The street we were on was all dark. All of a sudden. We got scared ofcourse and went to another street which still have lights on. We decided that we should call our parents instead and not use the bus. Later on my friends felt better but I still had something inside me. My dad was on his way to get us but I felt as if something was happening to him. When I called him I noticed that he was in a hurry. I knew I had to get to him as fast as I can. Finally he made it to where we were. He told me that car had something wrong and he couldn't know he didn't have enough gas and he hardly made it there. \n\nWe went to a gas station, however they had some problem and made us wait for 15-20 mins, yet we couldn't get anything so went for another gas station which is very close to one we were. \n\nThings went better later on. Even though acouple of times we were so close to get involved in a car crash, hopefully nothing happened after we leave there. \n\nI want to know if anything like that happened to you or do you have any idea why this happened to us. I just want some explanation, lots of weird shit happening and I'm scared.",

        "text": "I remember a few weeks ago I watched a Doraemon episode. It was about Nobita watching a movie and wanting a dog. Doraemon gives him a cream named \"PET\", and he rubs it on a rock. The rock starts barking, and then her mom hears a dog and goes upstairs. The dog hides behind the door, and she does not notice the dog. Blah blah, and then there's a scene where Suneo does the same, and there are holes all on the ground because he got a really big rock as a dog, and he fixes them. Then, the dog is inside the house and is running in circles, makes a hole in the ground and it falls. Then, Suneo decides to abandon his dog, the scene where he abandons it, is a mountain-ish place with rocks and a sea, it's night and raining, Suneo throws a tennis ball and goes away.\n    \n    \nBUT, yesterday I saw that the episode was different! Nobita's mom notices the dog that was under her, and she thinks that she might be hallucinating, and goes away. The Suneo scene is the same, except the outside is a bit different, and Suneo does not fix the holes. Instead of the dog running in circles and breaking the floor, the dog is outside howling. Then it sees Suneo on the balcony and breaks the wall (it's a big rock). Suneo decides to abandon the dog. But it gets abandoned in a sunny, place, and Suneo throws a disc and goes away.    \n    \n    \n    \nIs this a glitch in the matrix, or something?",

        "text": "I’ve posted in this sub before about my Deja Vu and knowing what’s gonna happen before it happens and being able to say it out loud sometimes. Well, I figured it was time to get some answers/opinions about something else I experience pretty regularly. \n\nFor as long as I can remember (but even more so recently), I have these things I call future memories. An example would be that I woke up for work one morning and pick out a white shirt. I got a feeling I should wear a black shirt instead so I changed into a black shirt. Later that day, I spilled coffee on myself but it wasn’t a big deal because I was wearing the black shirt. Another example is I woke up one morning and thought (for no apparent reason) I shouldn’t drive my car to class today. But, I didn’t have another car so I drove myself anyway. On the way to class, I got rear ended and my car was totaled. Or the time my husband and I were driving home from going out and we went the way we always do (a few times a week) but I told him we should go a completely different way than normal. We took the same route anyway and it turned out the middle of the road was blocked by a giant tree knocked down from a storm earlier in the week, and nobody had dealt with yet. \n\nI don’t know what to classify this as, so I call them my future memories. I don’t know if it’s some sort of deja vu, or if I can somehow “tell the future” but it happens all the time, and with little things mostly so it isn’t that big of a deal. Every time I realize it, it makes me really uncomfortable and I don’t know why. Has anyone had any similar experiences? Or know what I’m experiencing? ",

        "text": "This has happened to me a lot, and I usually just credit it to deja vu, but the last experience I had was way too vivid to be just a simple case of deja vu. \n\nLast week I was with my aunt and her in-laws, watching my cousin's swim meet. The day felt pretty normal until we all decided to go out to eat, i can't remember the name of the restaurant, and when I got out of the car I got an overwhelming feeling that I've done this all before. \n\nUsually that's all deja vu is, just a vague sense of remembering something, but can't tell where the memory is from. But in this case I felt like I was literally reliving a moment I've already experienced. \nIt started when I saw my reflection in the window and I looked at my outfit. Now, my Aunt is very judgmental and I feel like I have to watch what I wear or say around her, but in this instance I said fuck it and wore a crop top with shorts, which is usually fine but I could tell she was judging me and didn't really approve of it.\n\nWith this said, let me continue. \n\nI looked at myself and what I was wearing in the reflection in the window and thought \"I shouldn't have worn this, or I at least should have kept my sweatshirt on.\" It was in these exact words, and once I thought them shit got weird. \n\nAfter that happened I started feeling weird, the sense of deja vu crept in, but a lot stronger than it usually is. I held the door open for my cousins, and felt like I was almost being controlled? I don't know exactly how to word it but I felt like I already knew what to do, and was just going through the motions like one would when they were walking. It was just second nature. \n\nThe conversations at lunch were ones that I recognized, and I found myself knowing people's responses before they were even said. And despite never having been to the restaurant before, I knew my order without even looking at the menu. \n\nThe lunch felt more like a dream than real life, and the feeling of deja vu lasted longer than normal, at least twenty minutes. Which I thought was strange, especially since these moments are usually just a couple seconds or a minute at most. \n\nThe thing that finally broke my trance-like state was a weird sound coming from a tv that it seemed only my oldest (She's ten) cousin and I heard, since we were the only one's who reacted to it. We looked at each other with confusion on our faces and I looked around to find the source of the noise but there wasn't a tv anywhere. \n\nI think we were the only ones who heard it because she was acting as strange as I was during lunch, like she felt the same way I had. Later in the car ride home she asked my aunt what deja vu was, and had said she felt like that after my aunt had explained it. \n\nWas this just an intense feeling of deja vu or a glimpse into an alternate universe? If my cousin hadn't acted as strangely as I had I would say it was just deja vu, but I have never heard of shared deja vu. ",

        "text": "I've been a fan of this subreddit for months now, and I always wanted one of these weird experiences to happen to me, but now that it has I wish it hadn't because now I'm all sorts of fucked up. Just a few hours ago I was talking with my grandma and my mom, and a restaurant our whole family loves, El Charro (I believe that's how you spell it.) was brought up somehow. It's in Detroit, where my great aunt and cousins live. My Grandma was talking about how she hadn't had it in a while and wanted their famous 'puffy taco'. Now, we live in Grand Haven so the drive to Detroit is about three hours. When she said she hadn't had it in years I quickly spoke up, saying just last year when we were visiting her sister we went and ate there. She insisted that never happened but I remember that day vividly. I drove with my cousin in her black jeep and my grandma and great aunt drove separate. We sat down in the restaurant and as soon as we did I had to go back to their car to get my blue Grand Haven hoodie, and we decided to eat there because my great grandma was doing better (she's been in and out of hospitals and her Alzheimer's had been getting worse) and because I had never been. But when I brought up that day, my grandma said that she hadn't taken me up to Detroit in at least four years, and we never went to the restaurant that time because it was just a day trip. And what's weird about my memory is not only that I'm supposedly the only one who remembered it (My grandma texted my great aunt asking about the day, and she too didn't remember it happening) but that I don't remember the drive to Detroit, or why we were there in the first place, or anything about the trip besides having dinner at El Charro with my great grandma. Has anyone else experienced this? Or has a logical explanation? (Sorry if this wasn't well written, I suck at story telling.)",

        "text": "Ever since I was young I would have these odd experiences; seeing shadows with no body, making things move or disappear-never to find them again- or always having the feeling that someone is watching me, and capturing glimpses of this someone from the corner of my eye never to be seen in detail.\n\nBut one of the most.. Noticeable and slightly disturbing things to happen was that starting June 3rd this year.\n\nIt started off with me and my girlfriend wanting to meet up with a mutual friend of ours which we haven't seen in months. We decided to meet up on Saturday and have a fun day out at Ikea, a large furniture store, and play hide-and-seek there. We are very childish. This was the first time going out with friends in a while, I would always see them at school but never saw anyone else outside of school.\n\nA week later and me and my girlfriend (lets call her Jess) left to catch the train to meet our dearly missed friend (and we'll call her Sam). We met at the train-station, the three musketeers reunited at last!, and made our way through the town towards Ikea. After passing a large crowd of people, we walked under the bridge to get to the other side of town. Here, under the bridge, I stopped and looked to the ground. I stood there until Jess noticed and asked 'What's wrong?'. With no thought process, I just said 'Something terrible is going to happen today, not here, but south'. I looked up and they were both staring at me with confused faces. I laughed it off and said it was just a weird feeling and that they should just forget I said anything. They shrugged it off and we kept walking.\n\nWe had a great day, went to the cafe, slept on some beds, pushed each other through the place in trolleys, it was fun to get out the house and act childish once again, we all parted and went home.\n\nThe next day, I woke up at about 11:30, I was tired out from yesterday, and went downstairs. Walking through the living room I overheard on the TV about a man driving into pedestrians on London Bridge the day before, Saturday. I was freaked out.. I called up Jess and Sam in a rush telling them of the weird 'coincidence'. Given I live in the west midlands of England, my 'warning' the day before seemed eerily accurate.\n\nThat was merely the start of a number of very noticeable series of unnerving events and occurrences. What made this particular event more disturbing was what happened a few days later when I went to my local grocery store..\n\nI walked into the store and just as i was entering, noticed a man with the exact same jumper I have at home. I thought it was pretty funny how a 40-odd year old man had a jumper the same as me. I'm getting side-tracked. As I was walking around, collecting lettuce, getting coffee, picking up milk, I caught a glimpse of three people staring at me but as soon as i looked at them directly they turned around and walked off. I have to add; I'm not much of a looker but I'm not too out of the ordinary. My clothing was no different to anyone else's and I had no cuts or scars visible for anyone to stare at. It was odd, but it happens to people sometimes.\nAs I was at the checkout, putting the last bag of shopping back into the trolley, I looked up and the cashier was staring at me, so was the other cashier on the next isle, also the woman at the checkout, a man behind her with a scruffy white beard and a navy cap like a sailor, two other kids (about my age) looking into the window from outside, and a mother with her crying child... All staring at me, blank expression, not breaking eye contact even when I made it clear I noticed them. I got a sinking feeling in my gut and decided that there was no way I was going to stay. I had my shopping, I hastily walked out of the doors, grabbed my bags and walked home at a speed not quite considered walking nor jogging.\n\nI tried to sleep that night but those peoples faces had ingrained themselves into my thoughts. I slept 2 hours.. 3 hours at most for the next few days. I had social anxiety so the experience was even more shaking for me.\n\nThey're just two 'happenings' that occurred at the start of a long chain of weird and unsettling 'happenings'.",

I'm sure she wasn't lying because after some time I went to her house several times and there was always only the black dog.

I was dreaming peacefully and then something stoled the scene and scared me a lot, trying to kill me. Like, in some dreams I was chocking with something invisible, and in the other it appeared as my grandmother, but it was no good. In the last one I wasn't waking up and then I heard a feminine beautiful voice calling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes I sat and started thinking about the dream. Then I noticed that my room was a little bit clear, and then I looked at the book shelf and I saw a strong light. Instantly I covered myself and stayed starring at the light, cleaning my eyes, I didn't want to believe in that. It was the size of a small ball (tennis ball, I think). But then it started to move and get closer to me. I was watching through the cover and couldn't move myself because of the fear. I think I passed about 30 min looking at this think next to me, but then I got more calm and started to sleep again. When I woke up in the morning it wasn't there anymore. I have no clues about what was happening in my head and what was this light in my bedroom. I used to consider myself an \"atheist\", I'm not that kind of spiritual guy. But now everything looks different. It changed my life. I haven't see it since then, and I don't know if I'm going to see it one more time. My questions are: 1 Was my nightmare attacked by some external source? 2 Was the nightmare just my mind? 3 Was the light causing this nightmare and bad feelings? 4 Was the light trying to save me? (because I heard someone calling me inside my head) 5 What the f*ck is that light? Is it something good or bad? I don't know if it's a kind of \"spirit\" or something native to earth, maybe another \"dimension\" or something like this. Could anyone help me to solve this mistery?",

My roommate then took the dog out and I went in the bathroom to take a shower. I started the water and getting everything ready only to realize my towel was in the dryer. When I walked out to the living-room towards the other end of the apartment where the washer and dryer are, I saw that every window was wide open again. My roommate walks in and sees me staring at the open windows and asks why I opened them when the air is on and they're mowing outside. I told her I didn't touch the windows and have no idea how they could be open. .has this ever happened to anyone? ",

        "text": "Hello - I have bipolar disorder. Not sure if this necessarily belongs here, and let me know if it needs to be removed, but I feel that this sub can appreciate my experiences. Everyone that I've talked to has said that I'm crazy, or \"just seeing things\". The doctors say that I'm just finding patterns that were always there, and when manic I'm just over analytical so I see more of these patterns. However, the things that happened to me were so beyond coincidental, that I'm surely convinced that there was something bigger at play.\n\nI hope you take the time to read this wall of text and comment with your thoughts. I know it's a lot, so I completely understand if you have better things to do. Anyway...\n\nLet me start out by saying that I'm currently medicated, have been for a while, and haven't experienced any manic or psychotic tendencies since I started my medication. I see a psychiatrist regularly, and have been baseline for a while. I still feel the same about everything that happened to me while I was manic, though.\n\nFirst, the soccer ball. In the week leading up to my second manic episode/hospitalization, I was obsessed with learning how to juggle a soccer ball - something I've never known how to do. Within that week I went from being able to juggle maybe 2-3 times with one foot, to 50 times in a row with both feet and knees. When I was in the hospital, during occupational therapy (basically arts and crafts lol), I decided to make some bracelets (those ones that people wear to raves). I picked a random bucket that had maybe about 5000 different colored, round beads. All of the beads were the exact same shape/size. However, on top, right in the middle, there was a soccer ball bead - the only different bead in the lot.\n\nWhen I was younger, I played Runescape a LOT. Aimee Lynn was the name of one of my really good friends in the game. When I was in the hospital, I met an elderly woman named Aimee. We made an instant connection, and I can honestly say she was my closest friend while I was inside. I randomly asked her one day, \"hey Aimee, your last name isn't Lynn by any chance, is it?\" And it was. Kinda freaky.\n\nThis is the big one - the \"glitch in the matrix\" type thing. Ever since I was a kid, my lucky number has been 122. I saw it a lot - maybe that's just because I was looking for it though. I'd see 122 in license plates, in phone numbers, on my paychecks in high school. My Dad's company was located in zip code 2(122)6. Another good friend from Runescape's username was Ace122. I always thought it was cool how often I saw it - again, it might have been because I was looking for it. Now onto my episode... my girlfriend at the time of the episode's birthday was 12/21. I was 22 years old. My admission date to the psych ward was 11/22. In the hospital, I never saw room 122. I did see 123 however. When I left the psych ward, and went thru the doors leading out of the wing, the first door I saw was on my left, and was room 122. When I got out of the hospital, I began seeing a lot of ambulances and fire trucks. In fact right outside my house in a span of 2 days, there were 2 major accidents in almost the same spot where fire crews/ambulances were on the scene. I felt like something was trying to tell me something. I was still manic and pretty paranoid about it, so I decided that I needed to become an EMT. When I took a tour of the local fire station, the most recent engine they had purchased was Engine #122. In addition to this, the new psychiatrist my mom found - and my psychiatrist to this day - was located in office #1202 in his building. There are definitely other occurrences of this, but I can't think of any at the moment. I found all of these coincidences extremely overwhelming. I look at 122 as a sign from angels/ancestors that are showing me the right direction that I should take my life.\nAside from the visual coincidences, when I was manic I also had a heightened sense of \"energy\" or \"vibration\" so to speak. The people around me told me they were also experiencing an irregular number of odd happenings/coincidences while I was in my episode. On more than a few occasions, I would be thinking about something and then it would happen, or I would see it, or hear it on the radio. I would be thinking of people and they would text me or call me just as I was thinking of them. I know this a phenomenon that happens regularly, and we only notice those things when they do happen, leading to a confirmation bias (or whatever they call it) of sorts, but I am certain that this happened many more times than usual during my episode. Aside from that, I also had intense conversations with friends that we're going through rough times, and they all commented that they felt as though I had a special connection with them, a higher level of empathy, unlike anything that they'd ever experienced. In my delusion I attributed it to the fact that I was the modern day Jesus (lol). Just to note - I know that not to be true haha. But I still feel like I had a heightened sense of connection with my surroundings and others.\n\nI believe that people with bipolar disorder, especially during manic episodes, have an increased \"energy\" or \"vibration\" as I mentioned in the above paragraph, and are moreso in tune with the world/with others. I think that everyone has this ability, but it just tends to be increased/enhanced during these types of episodes. I feel like the coincidences that happened to me are too coincidental to not be a part of something bigger at play that we can't understand. I was a hardcore atheist up until these experiences, and now I consider myself to be very spiritual.\n\nI just wanted to share my experience with you all. I really appreciate it if you got to this point and took the time to read all of this, and I hope you can back to me with your thoughts on this/similar experiences, if you have any.",

I even took pics of the many licence plates that I would come across in the span of seconds all with this strange and constant grouping of the number six. So I am currently searching for a change of pace at work, maybe switching up to days. There's a new place I think I may apply at. There telephone number had 3 consecutive six's. *Just lost my mind",
