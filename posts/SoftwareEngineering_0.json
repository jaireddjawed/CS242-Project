        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a software engineer seeking advice on how to navigate my career path. I have experience with Golang, Python, and JavaScript, but I don't have a degree. I decided to switch careers at the beginning of 2022 and completed a 12-week software engineering immersive program in May 22 with some preparation. I spent about five weeks on my own grinding LeetCode and found a job as a software engineer in a startup in June 22 (a friend referred me, and I did really well on my interview - I solved array and binary search problems). I was mostly working with React, but I didn't enjoy the job very much. Since it was low-paying and low-stress, I dedicated all my free time to learning as much as I could about CS foundations and backend systems. I stayed there until the new year, because in December, I passed a pretty long backend apprenticeship interview at another company (node service as home test, 5h on site coding, ood, system design). In January, I started an apprenticeship in a new company, which has provided me with more opportunities to learn and improve. My main issue is that it can be stressful at times, and there is little help provided from my peers (they are overwhelmed with their workloads from my point of view). While working in this job, I have learned a lot about backend foundations, AWS services, and picked up a new language (Golang), which I really value, and I know it is going to help me in the long term. However, due to recent layoffs (12% of employees), I am unsure about my future at this company. My current apprenticeship is ending in a week, and instead of a full-time conversion, I was offered an eight-week extension with no promise.\n\nI would love to hear any advice or insights from the community on what steps I should take next to continue building my career in software engineering. How should I approach this? Should I continue to work at this company and hope for a conversion, or should I start looking for new opportunities elsewhere? What areas should I focus on improving in my skillset to make myself more marketable to potential employers? Should I start brushing up my leetcode? (I am comfortable with easy’s and mediums with more basic data structures, meaning there’s a lot of room for improvement!)\n\nP.S. Do you guys think that I would be better off finishing WGU BS CS in my free time just to check off that box on my resume?\n\n\nThank you in advance for any help you can provide!",

And so I wish to know, can a pirated software still ping/phone home to mother company even when deleted?\n* My completely layman's understanding of how software systems call home from a computer is that the specific program needs to be opened in the computer before it can phone home. In this case, the program wasn't opened because it had been deleted. And so my question is, can software still phone home from a computer without being opened?\n* Third, when a company engineers a software so that a pirated version sends signals/calls to mother company from a user's Pc, does the company have a way to find out when that software is deleted by the user? In other words will they know the exact time the software is deleted from a user's system? Because in the case of my friend, the software in question was deleted almost a year ago yet the company claims he was using it and wants him to buy a copy or face legal consequences.\n* Does the software company have a legal case in this situation?",

Part of this of course involves finding a new job.  \n\n\nI spent 4 years in college studying computer science back in 2005-2008.  At the tail end of my college life, I got a \"summer job\" at a small oil and gas service company.  I started with small projects writing code in Excel VBA and C# (something I learned I loved in a game programming class).  Eventually this leads to larger applications to handle datasets and statistics, automatic report generation and data interpretation.  And not going back to college.  \n\n\nOur company was purchased by a large corporation about 7 years in my tenure and most of us moved out of state to merge with a larger lab.  I pretty much kept doing the same thing, automating where I could with the tools I was familiar with: Visual Studio, C#, WinForms.    \n\n\nThe caveat to all this is I've been in my own bubble, working alone.  I do collaborate with all the end users to develop decent software, both UI and the underlying technology.  But I haven't worked on a team, and looking at these listings on Indeed with \"RESTful API\" and the other languages, cloud technology, etc. I feel like a dinosaur.  I am definitely willing to learn whatever is needed, but my lease is up the end of April and need to figure this out sooner than later.  Just a bit overwhelmed and maybe needing some direction.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/11sa0sy/a_move_to_quantum_safe_cryptography/",
        "text": " \n\nI'm not a Cryptographer, nor am I a Quantum Computation Engineer, as much as I wish I could wake up one morning as someone else... So, I came across an article on IBM's website, which will get it's due [credit.](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/what-is-quantum-safe-cryptography-and-why-do-we-need-it) &lt;=====Right there.\n\nAnyway, this is just a little piece of advice for anyone listening, Bad-Actors exist. They might be your neighbors for all you know. Ya, that sweet lady in her late 70's is probably trying to scam you somehow, believe it. But that's not news. You knew that already.\n\nHere's the news, quantum mechanics is compleeeexxxx, but I cracked enough of it to know it's more dangerous than any bomb we've ever built. And you add unregulated, unfettered advancements in AI to the quantum realm, hell you set AI upon the task of cracking the mysteries of the quantum realm, and the speed of our advancement exceeds the most imaginative child's wildest dreams. It sounds like Sci-Fi, it really does. It's [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm/) though, if you're interested.\n\nQuantum entanglement, all by it's lonesome, forces us to question the laws that govern our every-day lives. Two particles, entangled, can share the physical properties like spin, position, and polarization, to name a few, across any distance. In theory this happens instantaneously, in practice we utilize this to create quantum computers, and who knows what else...\n\nSo, to get back on track: I'm warning you all!!! ahhh, queue the ominous music and scary noises. Quantum computing is available for individuals to start learning, and someone with enough intelligence, information, and determination could probably build one at home. Other countries are undoubtably on the quantum train too. My point is this, quantum algorithms can crack the best of our encryptions quick enough to make any hacker gasp.\n\nNow, I don't know how many passwords you've entered today, but imagine every system you tried to log into was shut down. Shit, Google's Search Engine was down. That would be the start of something catastrophic right? Even a day of that would send people into a panic. Quantum safe cryptography is the only way to prevent quantum abuse of classical computation systems. Perhaps not the only way, and perhaps that's not a fool-proof method of data security. I mean after-all, the quantum realm implies some odd connectivity of everything... Theories be damned for the moment, I need to make this plea sociologically, to the human in you. We need people researching in this field, we need Quantum Engineers to lend some of their thought to the problems of safely transitioning into a Quantum Era. It will change things, and it's coming a hell of a lot faster than most of you think.",

Therefore. I've asked my non-technical bosses if I could have access to github to see the code for our software so I can have a better understanding of how it's all set up. \n\nThey talked to the dev Dave. He seemed very off and made every excuse about why he doesn't want to share (for the record, nobody has ever seen it.) I suggested just giving me view access in github so there's no chance I alter anything, and that I won't waste his time by asking questions. 0 downside. He convinced my boss that he should only have access. To me this makes no sense and I think he's hiding something.\n\nI think Dave the dev might be intentionally working very slowly and taking home a huge salary, and lying about his logged hours. My non technical bosses are very naive and have no idea how dev projects actual take so they take him at his word. Does this seem likely to be true? Is it normal for a dev to want to have nobody else understand/ see their code? Let me know what you think, trying to convince my bosses that his behavior is odd/ irrational and a data analyst should have access to the code",

For reference, I'm looking to get into robotics software engineering and currently I'm practicing and learning, C,C++,Python,Java,Html. I'm only learning java and Html cause I've always been interested in building apps.\n\nMy brother plans to spend time after work and his days off practicing and learning with me and after maybe a year he wants to apply for a Jr position without any degree. Personally I do think it's possible, but being an engineer I know a lot of companies will want him to have a degree in something like CS. I know my view may be different because I'm on a slightly different side of the industry but I still think it would be difficult for him. My question is, how difficult do you guys think it is? do you work with anyone whose done this or know anyone? people on YT say they've done it but I take that with a grain of salt. I've tried asking around but I have a Bachelors in MechE and not a single person I work with is just a HS grad. Any insight would be great.\n\nPS. Any suggestions on what he should do would also be great, Thanks in advance everyone.",

I am a full time Journeyman Industrial Mechanic for one of the big three American Automakers. I have a significant amount of down/free time at work which has allowed me to pursue higher education. I currently am attending University of Maryland Global Campus. This fall I will be going into my 2nd year of undergrad. Now I will get to my question(s).. \n\nMy initial plan was to transfer to Oregon State University this fall as a full time online student for their BS in CS, and to finish my degree in 3 years. I planned to transfer there because from what I've read, they seem to have a more rigorous and respected program compared to UMGC. Recently I discovered that UMGC is accepting training from my time in the military as 30 elective credit hours. In doing so, my degree would only take 2 years to complete, compared to 3 years at OSU. \n\nTo get to my point: \n\nI am a full time working adult, with a family in children, and I work in a unrelated career field. So internships/co-ops are off the table. My goal with obtaining my degree is to learn as much as possible and become as prepared   As possible to change careers. My degree is not to check a box. \n\nShould I stick to my original plan of 3 years of education at OSU in their CS program, or should I finish an accelerated path at UMGC and try to get into the field a year sooner? Both degrees would be a BS in CS. I would still take all major and gen ed requirements. I would take little to no electives at UMGC, and would take 30 credit hours of electives at OSU. \n\nNeither school cost me anything because of my GI Bill and employer tuition assistance. \n\nBeing in the Midwest, does either school hold more weight over the other? \n\nSince I have no work experience in this field, would OSU program prepare me more than UMGC? Or would UMGC prepare me enough and I should start working sooner?\n\nThanks!",

It was really hard at the beginning as I didn’t have any developing background but a few months later im now doing frontend work and will move to learn backend soon. \n\nAlthough this is not ME, I really enjoy this job and would like to continue developing my career in this direction. However, my college background is not CS.\n\nDo yall think my non-cs background will be a limiting factor in the future when looking for a new job?

        "text": "I am fresh off an.. experience... with the maintainer of springdoc-openapi for Java and I thought that this might be a good place to discuss the matter in a more abstract way. Perhaps I will also be venting a little, so apologies for that.\n\nTo summarize, I've found a bug in the library, which is due to it not adhering to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification (basically, \\`$ref\\` can't have siblings). I have reported the issue on the library's Github page, with a description and a test proving the issue. The issue was closed as \"invalid\". The maintainer said I can \"create a PR if I think it's an issue\".\n\nI argued that it is a valid issue, as the library should adhere to the spec (it's in the name, after all). I created a PR with a simple fix for the issue (\"if $ref, then wrap in allOf\"). The PR was closed with the only comment being \"not approved\" and the issue was completely deleted (erased from existence).\n\nI created another issue, this time quoting directly from [swagger.io](https://swagger.io), showing screenshots from [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io) validation to prove that the library is creating invalid OpenAPI descriptions and that my  suggestion creates valid ones, rephrasing the entire problem from a slightly different angle. I asked that if he decides to close the issue, to please not delete it so that it serves as documentation for others.\n\nThe maintainer commented that I am being banned for \"violating the code of conduct\" (never said how). Minutes later, he, again, deleted the issue, erasing it from existence. There is now no documentation showing that the bug exists in the library.\n\nEach time I created an issue, I strictly followed the contributing guidelines. I never used any derogatory terms or insults. I simply stated my arguments.\n\nPreviously, my and my friends' issues on this library's Github were closed as \"invalid\", to then sometimes be sneakily fixed later, with no mention to the original reporters. Basically, he seems to be stealing the credit for many contributions.\n\nThere are no open issues or PRs on this repository despite its popularity, which makes me think there's many more people who were treated this way.\n\nI have created issues and made PRs to other Github projects without problems, and maintain some libraries of my own. This kind of behavior is somewhat unusual to me and I'm at a loss on how to proceed.\n\nI mentioned the library by name, because it solves an incredibly popular issue and is currently the only available solution for OpenAPI 3.0, being sponsored by the likes of Mercedes-Benz. I can't just use a different library, as the community is pouring all its resources into this one.\n\nI would have \"shown my receipts\", but the entire discussion has been deleted by the maintainer...\n\nIn conclusion, what should people like me do in situations like this, where the maintainer of a very popular library is being so difficult to work with? Name and shame like I sort of did now? Is there anything I could do to enact any sort of change?\n\nShould I have done things differently?\n\nWhat are your opinions on this?\n\nP.S.\n\nI'm more of a lurker so apologies if this somehow isn't the best fit for the sub. Kindly direct me to another sub if it would be a better fit.",

I am just trying to get a degree so I can put it on the resume and not get filter out by the resume sorting algorithm that HR and employers use.  I don't expect to get high quality training/education as only about a handful of colleges in the US are able to do that, and it seems that amongst software engineers/ developers, etc, the general consensus is the best training is what you do on your own with your own time. I'm not really aiming to become a FAANG developer so if those companies are very particular about the type of college you went too then that's not really a big deal for me. The only other college near me is UNCC and I don't even know what their rep is and I rather not go to an academic heavy school. So is it a bad idea to get a degree from ECPI, will it get me black listed from most companies in the software development field?

        "text": "There's a thing I'm trying to define. I can describe it with examples, or a lot of explanation, but I'm writing this post to see if it has a name. Some kind of handle I can use to research more about it or more easily discuss it.\n\nI've fallen into a role as a lead on a team wherein every other developer is an offshore contractor. Not ideal, I know, but that's not really what the post is about. These folks are intelligent, hardworking, and experienced, but there's a certain collection of skills and priorities that they lack that has been frustrating me to no end. It's like a laziness, but one that applies only to concerns of readability and maintainability.\n\nFor example, they might find that to resolve a story they can modify a function GetAllX so that it only gets certain X. Now it no longer gets ALL X, but they don't rename it. The function signature will be a lie to the next developer who reads it.\n\nThey won't refactor large, convoluted functions. Just keep adding little by little story by story until it becomes a monster.\n\nThey leave comments because I tell them to, but they don't seem to really \\*get\\* what makes a comment valuable or when/why a comment might be valuable. \n\nThey'll use multi-line ternary operators and large conditions you need a pen and paper to understand.\n\nI'm tempted to say \"maintainability\" or \"readability\" but those don't feel quite right. It's almost more like \"empathy\". The ability to put yourself in the shoes of the next guy who has to work with the code you're writing.\n\nIt wasn't trained in university and I seriously doubt it's trained in boot camps. No interview I've experienced seems to be searching for this, but it's the thing I most desperately want in a co-worker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Found this sub specifically while searching for an appropriate place to pose this question. Let me know if I'm mistaken :)",

Currently, I’m pursuing a computer science degree and know my skillset greatly matches that of a software engineer.\n\nNeed advice/insights regarding 3 major things:\n1. What exactly are the differences in roles &amp; responsibilities and pay for both the roles in the UK.\n2. [IMP] How to convince the recruiter(who reached out) that I wish to sit for the software engineer intern process first without sabotaging my chances at the QA test engineer role.\n3. Is it possible to first join as a QA test engineer intern and then if a full time role is offered, move to the software engineer role?\n\nWould really appreciate any help!\n\nPS- If anyone knows what is L&amp;RE at Apple (in terms of jobs), please let me know!",
