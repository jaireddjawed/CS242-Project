Do you find it surprising?",

Divorced parents, they got baptized together (Christian). My dad has a very serious case of MS and he cannot even walk anymore at this point so he uses a wheelchair to get around everywhere. He is remarried to a christian women as well. I switch houses every week but neither family goes to church. They aren't super religious but they prey and believe in god, I however do not believe in god.\n\nLast weekend I was staying at my grandma's place (she gets lonely, grandpa died few years ago) and when Sunday morning came, I told her I did not want to go to church. This is because I stayed up until 4:00 in the morning and was super tired upon waking up. She explained that I have to come to show my love for god, all the good stuff we love hearing. That is when I told her that I don't believe in god and we got in a small argument (not a hostile argument, more of a discusion with some disappointment). She eventually left without me. When she got back she didn't mention anything and seemed normal but I know she will tell my dad and a discussion will be coming up so I am just looking for some pointers or what to excpect in the inevitable talk coming soon. \n\nI know my parents won't disown me or anything extreme like that, will mostly just be dissapointed. I am just looking for advice or seeing if anyone has had a similar experience. Any help on my situation?\n\nEDIT: Wow didn't except to wake up with this many replies! Thanks everyone. I read over all of your comments and I think I now know how I want to handle the situation. I won't bring it up but in case my parents do I will be prepared for it, thanks guys!",

During the sermon/homily, the deacon spoke. \n\nA little backstory, this man and myself have never really gotten along, ever since I chose not to be a server back in 5th or 6th grade. He once made a comment to my brother (who did serve) saying that he (my brother) was the 'first' true catholic child of the family in front of me. This was when I was in like 9th grade, and I was just so hurt by that comment it has stuck to me to this day.\n\nSo today, he talking about how he puts god first in everything, before his wife, his kids. He blatantly said he would choose god over his own family. This is typical wacko talk from him, what I'm used to. He then goes on to make comments about Ireland's decision, and how it goes against god's word, and how he couldn't believe the heavily catholic Irish country would choose to live in sin rather than follow god's word. \n\nHe continues with making almost a joke about Caitlyn (Bruce) Jenner, and how terrible it was \"he\" would turn his back on god and the gender god gave \"him\" at birth. (I put it in quotes to show how the deacon described it).\n\nAt this point, I was fuming. There are a lot of children in the congregation, and it hurt me to see them and their parents just stand up after all the hatred and intolerance and accept it. I was so mad I just stood up and walked out. I couldn't sit there another second longer pretending like I was even remotely okay with the words this awful man was saying. I've just never felt so hurt and upset after going to mass. \n\nI sat outside on a bench and waited for my family to come out. My nanny family came out and I felt bad, I tried to make small talk but their mom could tell I was obviously upset. \n\nI told my mom later (who was also taken back by his comments, and says that's not what she believes).\n\nHas anyone else ever gone through something like this? I just cannot stand the bullshit argument against same-sex marriage (or HUMAN EQUALITY, as it should be described). Why do people think they can hide behind one stupid passage in a book written and retranslated thousands of years ago and pretend that they are standing up for 'god'???? Why does Caitlyn Jenner's life have any bearing on what you do? Who cares if she wants to be a woman? WHO CARES!?! \n\nThis got really long, I thank anyone who takes the time to read it. /rant\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments, y'all. It's nice to get feedback from like-minded rational people :)\n",

Saying \"I just don't think there is enough evidence to support the existence of a God\" doesn't seem to satisfy people.

        "text": "**EDIT: Added headers and made some parts clearer**\n\n**EDIT: Definition of agnosticism (two kinds used in this thread. Pay attention to which is used)**\n\n**Definition 1**: Used as an ADJECTIVE to show how much one KNOWS about a belief, that is, how certain the belief is true based on evidence. E.g. An agnostic atheist/theist is not very certain whether their respective beliefs are true. Gnostic atheists/theists are very certain because they think they have evidence. NOTE: In academia, \"strong\" and \"weak\" is used to mean this definition instead of \"gnostic\" and \"agnostic\" respectively.\n\n**Definition 2**: Used as a NOUN to mean a kind of belief. The belief is that one is unsure about whether a claim is true or false as one has no good evidence for the claim being either true or false\n\nDefinition 1 is the ONLY definition of agnosticism that many people on the internet use. I don't care whether you use definition 1 or not. What I want is for you to use definition 2 AND definition 1, or simply just definition 2, as well as \"strong\" and \"weak\" to replace definition 1\n\nImportant: I am not saying you should no longer distinguish between KNOWLEDGE and BELIEF. You can still talk about how certain one of the belief positions are true or not. I only want you to accept that there is ONE MORE belief position other than \"I believe X is true\", and \"I believe X is false\"\n\n**End edit**\n\n~~I just recently had a discussion with another redditor here about the definition of atheism, and how it differs between academic and colloquial use. I wish to have more input on this if possible. I know this dissucussion has been done to death, but many people still seem to adopt the less precise definition of atheism, and I naively want to change that. Most of this post is copied straight from that discussion.~~\n\n**Argument 1: You should use definition 2 ON TOP of definition 1 because credible professionals use it**\n&gt;an agnostic is someone who neither believes nor disbelieves in God, whereas an atheist disbelieves in God.\n\nThis is taken from https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/agnosticism. I would think one of the prominent philosophy journals, as well as a philosopher who specialises in the Philosophy of Religion, would have a better definition of a philosophical term than a conventional dictionary or the internet? Normal dictionaries only use the conventional usage of a term. And there's usually nothing wrong with that, since languages change all the time. But, in this case, not defining agnosticism and atheism this way creates very imprecise definitions. That is why philosophers in academia don't use it. And I hope you won't use it too if you value good philosophical discussions about religion.\n\n**Argument 2: You should use definition 2 ON TOP of definition 1 because a third type of belief exists that definition 2 acknowledges**\n\nThe main problem with agnosticism is that many people online don't seem to recognise that it can be a stand-alone position to take by itself. I will attempt to show why it can be.\n\nIt's true that claims are binary. The claim \"God exists\" is necessarily either true, or false. However, beliefs about claims are not. Beliefs about whether \"God exists\" can be true, false, or undecided. \n\nTo better see this, consider a simple analogy. If I were to ask you whether I'm eating anything right now, it'll be awfully unreasonable for you to believe that I'm either eating, or not eating right now. This is despite the fact that I must do either one of the things. You don't have any evidence for either belief, since you don't know me at all, and the most reasonable position to take would be \"I don't know at all\". It would be irrational for you to believe that I'm eating, or that I'm not eating. In academic circles, the label for \"I don't know\" is agnosticism.\n\nI hope I've shown that \"I don't know\" by itself can be a reasonable position to take in cases like the one above. So regarding beliefs, there are three possible positions to take: 1) I believe X is true, 2) I believe X is false, and 3) **I do not have enough evidence to believe either X is true or false. I am unsure**. Of course, claims can only be either true or false, but you may not have good reasons for either claim in some cases. There, you'll be justified to not pick either side of that claim when you adopt a belief.\n\n****\n\n**Edit:** In academic use, the terms are used like so.\n\na. A theist is someone with a type 1 belief (I believe \"God exists\" is true). A strong theist is someone who knows or thinks there is good evidence for this and is very certain theism is true. Vice versa for weak theists.\n\nb. An atheist is someone with a type 2 belief (I believe \"God exists\" is false). A strong atheist is someone who knows or thinks there is good evidence for this and is very certain atheism is true. Vice versa for weak atheists.\n\nc. An agnostic is someone with a type 3 belief (I do not have enough evidence to believe \"God exists\" is either is true or false.). A strong agnostic is someone who believes we can never know any good evidence for the claim \"God exists\" to be true or not\n\n****\n\nThis is the reason why the popular definition of an atheist is so unhelpful, since by saying that you \"lack a belief in God\", you're only saying that you're not (1). You can still either be (2) or (3), which are mutually exclusive positions to take. Don't tell me you can hold both (2) and (3) at the same time, because even by claiming a very weak belief that \"God does not exist\", you're already claiming that you know something (even if you're very uncertain), which contradicts position (3). This is why this definition of atheism is so imprecise. I wouldn't know which mutually exclusive position you have accepted.\n\n\n\nAlso, the burden of proof is on those who claim (1) or (2), e.g. whether they believe God exists or not exists, regardless of how certain their beliefs are. For example, to convince someone that I am eating right now (a type 1 claim), you must provide evidence. Perhaps you have a photo of me eating you can show them. To convince someone that I'm not eating right now (a type 2 claim), you must also provide evidence. Perhaps the photo you have shows that I'm not actually eating at all. If you want to convince someone that you adopt (3), you just have to shrug your shoulders and say that you don't know, without have giving any evidence. The burden of proof is not on you at all, just like how only agnostics, as I've defined, are the only ones that don't have a burden of proof. \n\nThis is the problem the imprecise definition of atheism leads to. Atheists now believe they are not entitled to having to produce a burden of proof. In fact, there are arguments atheists can use for the belief that God doesn't exist. The Problem of Evil is one of them.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn popular use, agnosticism is only used as a qualifier for how certain a belief is (e.g. agnostic agnostics are less certain about their agnosticism than gnostic agnostics). This is despite how academic circles have the other meaning for it I just mentioned, which is in it being a valid, stand-alone position to adopt by itself. I have nothing wrong with people using agnosticism as a qualifier (just make sure you accept it is a reasonable belief position on its own) since languages change. But just note that academic circles use \"strong\" and \"weak\" to describe how certain they are of beliefs (1), (2) or (3).\n",

Is it better to publish things like this and more serious, critical works in spite of Islamic terror, or to stay silent to protect oneself?\n\nI feel like the second option is usually quickly dismissed as cowardice, but I see no shame in being unwilling to die for publishing a book.

        "text": "A little background: I was raised a hardcore southern Baptist and took it all very seriously.  I would read my bible everyday, attend church 2-3 times a week, and pray constantly.  I remember I always felt like I was not a good Christian, and therefore, not a good person.  I would have \"dirty\" thoughts, I wasn't proselytizing enough, I would sometimes listen to \"bad\" music, and, most importantly, I didn't feel like God would talk to me when I prayed.  This made me feel like a bad person for my childhood and teen years, which is pretty messed up considering I was just a normal kid.\n\nIt wasn't until college that I began questioning my faith, due to a philosophy course at a christian college, and now I would consider myself at best agnostic.  \n\nAnyways, I was listening to Moody bible radio, mainly for shits and giggles, during a long drive for work.  At one point, the pastor stated that he has had people come to him and state that a Christian has \"lost their way,\" basically meaning that person is no longer going to church, acting like a Christian, etc.  The pastor's response was simple.  He stated that if that is the case, he would doubt if that person was ever truly \"saved\" to begin with.\n\nThis infuriated me.  All the years of self doubt, fear of hell, of feeling like I was not good enough, and trying my hardest to do what God would want me to do, and still feeling nothing but guilt and lack of worth and this asshole will just wave it away by saying I wasn't saved?  Basically that I wasn't committed enough.  That is absolute nonsense, and a complete cop out.\n\nThe truth is I am one of the few who took it 100% serious.  Who did everything that was asked of me, and still felt like I wasn't doing enough because I didn't feel the things, or hear the things, I was told I was supposed to.  That is why I began to question my faith.  Not because of a lack of trying or commitment, but because I listened, I believed, and basically the program didn't work.  After 15+ years of this, I began to think \"Hey, maybe I am not the screwed up one, maybe the program is.\"  The further I got away from Christianity, the better I felt.  No longer did I feel like I was some evil person, who was never good enough.  I was happy with who I was, which is something Christianity wouldn't let me do.  There was ALWAYS something I was doing wrong, something that made me evil.  For fuck's sake, I went up to the pulpit and was \"saved\" three separate times when I was eight years old because I was so afraid of going to hell.\n\nAlso, if I wasn't truly \"saved,\" who's fault is that?  The eight year old boy who believed everything 100% and prayed to be saved and tried to be a good Christian?  Or the almighty all knowing God who would have had to ignore the eight year old boy?\n\nAnyways, I know this is a bit of a rant, but I go into work this morning fuming and needed a place to vent. Thanks for reading.\n\n",

It simply felt like the right thing to do. \n\nHowever, that being a weak basis, I decided to do some research on consciousness. Slightly unsurprisingly, I found many sources explaining the data collected of tests on the very subject relating to animals, stating that animals have been showing signs of consciousness. However, there are still scientists that say that other animals are merely displaying \"mechanical\" reactions that simply outwardly appear like what we define as consciousness. \n\nThinking to myself on the idea, it came to me that it would be very odd that out of all the diversity on this Earth, our species would be the only one to possess consciousness of a sort. Therefore, until otherwise convinced, I still value the concept of not harming any ~~life forms~~ creatures(?) in any way (or, at the very least, mammals), and to treat them with respect, as this is their only life, as well. \n\nI would like to hear your guys' personal thoughts on the subject and how you treat ~~non-human lifeforms~~ animals, insects, etc. (i.e.: Do you kill, eat, or treat them recklessly, etc.? Or do you abstain from killing and eating, or treat them as a conscious being, etc.?).",

Apart from the average stuff a twenty something does, I post photos from atheist meet ups, share tons of links from Lawrence Krauss, Richard Dawkins, conventions, etc. I have a coworker who is Christian and very serious about it (you don't see many our age this religious around here in Canada), and she ended up wanting to talk to me during a shared lunch this week...\n\nWe talked about how the vocal minorities give the majority a bad name. (Westboro baptist, etc) when I ended up lumping creationists into the same group as homophobes and other bad examples of religion doing it wrong. This got her saying that \"people can believe in cave men, and the Big Bang and whatever the hell else they believe in, but I don't think that stuff is right.\"\n\nI went on to ask her if she would ever consider that the bible says why, and science describes how. I explained that the evidence and strength of the claims made by evolution are in no lesser standing than for Gravity, and given what we know, it's probably better to have a faith that accommodates the scientific evidence than doesn't. We had a very brief conversation about science and religion and how she can reconcile the two, since many people accept evolution and Jesus together, but lunch was over. We enjoyed the talk and agreed we could talk about it again some time.\n\nSeveral hours later I jump on Facebook and decide to message her about how polite and open she is about this kind of talk, and explained that I would lay out for her my understanding of science and specifically evolution.\n\nI covered the scientific method. I covered what the word theory means, giving examples of different theories in science and how we came to verify them from plate tectonics to relativity to evolution. I spent a good paragraph or two dealing with the testable predictions evolution makes and how they are verified, and that she can accept evolution and still walk away a believer.\n\nThis led to a few hours of back and forth about clarification for her sake, as well as how she could square it with her current belief. She was curious and mentioned something along the lines that the bible isn't specific, it's vague, there's plenty of room for science to explain things. (A seemingly great start)\n\nIt all fell apart after a few more examples of evidence for evolution. In her final message to me, I realized I had turned a curious believer into a hardened fundamentalist. She Seemingly on her own, and in a matter of minutes, began using the basic forms of creationist arguments against science like \"science is just man's word... God is always right\" - \"for reasons science can't explain, man WAS created in gods image.. And God was NOT an ape\". Revealing her inner thoughts and reactions to the subject matter finally bubbling to the surface.\n\nI ended it by drawing the analogy that choosing what is true to you doesn't make it true objectively, I can chose gravity isn't true and jump out a window for example... What evidence that I haven't explained over these last few hours would change your mind that evolution were true? To which I ran into the argument of non-contradiction; the bible is the word of God, who can't be wrong. The bible says evolution isn't true... Therefore Evolution simply cannot and will never be true. Science is incorrect and refuses to acknowledge it.\n\nWe surprisingly ended on good terms and thanked each other for the exchange... But the lesson here is DO NOT LEAD WITH EVIDENCE! Be Socratic, and clean up their methods of coming to knowledge (Peter Boghossian style), or you may just create a fundamentalist. :(",

Nations under God argues that where religious and national identities have historically fused, churches gain enormous moral authority—and covert institutional access. These powerful churches then shape policy in backrooms and secret meetings instead of through open democratic channels such as political parties or the ballot box.\n&gt; \n&gt; Through an in-depth historical analysis of six Christian democracies that share similar religious profiles yet differ in their policy outcomes—Ireland and Italy, Poland and Croatia, and the United States and Canada—Anna Grzymała-Busse examines how churches influenced education, abortion, divorce, stem cell research, and same-sex marriage. She argues that churches gain the greatest political advantage when they appear to be above politics. Because institutional access is covert, they retain their moral authority and their reputation as defenders of the national interest and the common good.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nations under God shows how powerful church officials in Ireland, Canada, and Poland have directly written legislation, vetoed policies, and vetted high-ranking officials. It demonstrates that religiosity itself is not enough for churches to influence politics—churches in Italy and Croatia, for example, are not as influential as we might think—and that churches allied to political parties, such as in the United States, have less influence than their notoriety suggests.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anna Grzymała-Busse is the Ronald and Eileen Weiser Professor of European and Eurasian Studies at the University of Michigan. Her books include Rebuilding Leviathan: Party Competition and State Exploitation in Post-Communist Democracies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Endorsement:\n&gt; \n&gt; \"In this excellent book, Anna Grzymala-Busse demonstrates that the policy influence of organized religion in democracies depends not on the population's religiosity but on the church's moral authority within the political community, constructed over the course of national history. The originality of the argument, the methodological sophistication of the research, and the extensive historical and comparative evidentiary basis for the book's conclusions all make Nations under God an example of comparative politics at its best. The book is likely to serve as an essential point of reference for future work on the multifaceted and often uneasy relationship between religion and politics in modern democracies.\"--Giovanni Capoccia, University of Oxford\n&gt; \n&gt; \"In a penetrating analysis of why, when, and where religions have influence on politics, Grzymala-Busse demonstrates the importance of hard-won institutional access by church and other religious actors in those democracies where organized religion holds inordinate sway. Combining wide-ranging history, statistical evidence, and a compelling narrative account, Nations under God transforms forever our understanding of the links between religion and politics.\"--Margaret Levi, director and professor of political science, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University\n&gt; \n&gt; \"In this magisterial book, Anna Grzymala-Busse explains why churches in some nations wield political influence while churches in others do not. Wise, ambitious, and beautifully crafted, Nations under God is a model of comparative political analysis and is required reading for anyone interested in religion and politics.\"--James A. Morone, author of The Devils We Know and Hellfire Nation\n\n\nWhat do you guys think? Has anyone read this book? I think analysing how religion influences policy is very important to understand the full effect of faith based beliefs on society. ",

There were counterarguments in my head but I was not doing a very good job of relating them in a straightforward manner.  I was hoping that r/trueatheism could help me with some concise arguments.  \n\nMy buddy points out that if the rate of expansion after the Big Bang was one trillionth of a percent faster, the universe would've flown apart and that if it was one trillionth of a percent slower, it never would've expanded enough to form planets and suns and galaxies.  \n\nHe also cited the idea that if someone living in the jungle with no access to modern technology were wandering on a beach and found a watch, they would intuit that it has been designed intelligently.  They may not know what it is used for but they'd know it had a designer, and just as that person's assumption would be valid and sound, so are the assumptions that belie the idea that when you look at how finely tuned the universe is, you know it just had to have a creator.\n\nSo whaddya think?  What would you say to these arguments?\n",

But for those that believe religion itself is a foolish idea for all the outlandish claims (all powerful creator, purpose for living, etc) shouldn't spirituality be grouped along with that? What makes humans believe they're so special, and why is it so hard to believe that we got here by chance and natural processes? Or are those who identify as spiritual really all that different from me or are they just busting my balls?\nPossibly missing points and asking loaded questions but that's why I'm asking.",

        "text": "One of the basics of scepticism is, if you hold a belief, you need to ask yourself what it would take for you to change your mind. I ask fellow atheists this sometimes and I get responses like:\n\n- Maybe if god moved the stars across the sky to say \"I am god, I am real and I care about the affairs of humanity\"\n\n- Maybe if God directly responded to a direct, specific prayer.\n\n- Maybe if god directly appears in Times Square, is telecasted live across the world and personally speaks to many members of humanity, including me.\n\nAnd so I say \"okay, well, it's more likely to be a global conspiracy amongst the astronomical science community/prodigious coincidence/media conspiracy targeted at you or atheism in general than to be an omnipotent, omniscient god, no?\"\n\nTo which I get the response \"maybe from a materialist perspective but any *reasonable* person would consider that enough evidence\". I don't really know how that can be said without intellectual dishonesty; that's a completely arbitrary boundary to draw, and if that works, why can't the boundary be lower if it still impacts someone greatly on a personal level? More importantly, how are we even creating this claim that \"coincidence/chance is more likely than it being an act of literal god\"? How do we determine how improbable it is other than just saying it like it's a fact, when it clearly isn't? I never get the steps behind arriving at this conclusion.\n\nThe other response is something along the lines of \"well that's just proof that a belief in god can never be reasonable\". How's that not just placing a dishonestly high bar on testing for \"god\" and making an unfalsifiable claim?\n\nUltimately, if it's something you can't believe happened in the absence of divine intervention, shouldn't that be enough? Someone else's personal experience shouldn't be enough to convince *you*, but I don't see how you can call anyone else's belief due to personal experience unreasonable.\n\nI ask all this because I'm an atheist and I totally understand the unreasonableness of a belief in god but something happened to me that makes me think that maybe that's just denial on my part.

Nothing is achieved when two sides talk past each other.**  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAs the title indicates, Hemant Mehta has spoken out on his blog against a \"Draw Muhammad\" event to be held outside a mosque in Phoenix, organized by an atheist named Jon Ritzheimer. A brief selection of Mehta's comments:\n\n\n&gt;I’ve said before that I don’t mind people who draw images of Muhammad if it’s done for good reason. Standing in solidarity with Charlie Hebdo? Doing it as a symbol of free speech? I could understand and defend those reasons.\nDoing it to piss off Muslims or to draw attention to yourself? Now, you’re just being a dick.\n\n...\n\n&gt;I don’t support this event. I hope you don’t either. Ritzheimer has no obligation to listen to me, but I can at least condemn his actions. There’s no higher principle at work here. If there was, he wouldn’t need to resort to these shock-jock tactics. The only thing he’ll accomplish is pissing off Muslims (and plenty of non-Muslims) without creating the conversation he claims this is really all about.\n\nPersonally, I agree with Mehta on this, but I've heard plenty of arguments in favor of these \"Draw Muhammad\" events. What are your thoughts?\n\nEDIT: Just for the sake of clarity and fruitful discussion, NO ONE in the article or in this thread (so far, 2 hours after posting) is arguing that the \"Draw Muhammad\" event in question does not fall under the category of protected free speech, nor is anyone suggesting that it shouldn't be protected free speech.\n\nThe much more interesting issues (in my opinion) are: Is there a need for \"responsible\" use of free speech? Do events like this damage public perception of atheism (and should we care)? Do defiant acts like wearing a shirt that reads \"Fuck Islam\" outside a mosque actually accomplish anything, like encouraging critical thinking and good dialogue between Muslims/Christians/atheists/etc.?\n\n**The question isn't, \"What *can* we do?\"...it's \"What *should* we do?\"**\n\nEdit 2: And just so it doesn't go unnoticed, the leader of the mosque, Usama Shami, publicly defended Ritzheimer's rights to free speech, including holding the \"Draw Muhammad\" contest outside the mosque. In his words: \n\n&gt;\"Everybody has a right to be an idiot,\" said Shami.\n\nRitzheimer is protesting in the name of free speech against someone who **affirms the right to free speech**.\n",

        "text": "My father and I have an ongoing back-and-forth over email on a number of topics. Recently, he sent me [this article](http://www.christianpost.com/news/how-christianity-made-children-human-139264/) by Eric Metaxas titled \"How Christianity Made Children Human,\" in which Metaxas praises Matthew 18:6 and criticizes the practices of ancient Hellenic society.\n\nI offered the following response:\n\n***\n\nWhile it is undeniably true that Greco-Roman society was far crueler to children than most would like to remember, Metaxas' article is largely revisionist nonsense. Both the Hellenic and Semitic traditions have their dark pasts.\n\nFor a refresher on Biblical “morality” regarding children, remember injunctions favoring parents against children, such as Exodus 21:15, 21:17, Leviticus 20:9, or Deuteronomy 21:18-21, the penalty for which was - in every case - death. Or consider the circumstances Lot, Jephthah, and Caleb’s daughters, or the fate of the firstborn sons of Egypt, or the end met by Elisha’s critics. Also examine the state of affairs for the children of the Canaanites, Hittites, Gargashites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites, and Amalekites: “Utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not, but slay both men and women, children and babies” (1 Samuel 15:3).\n\nEven the detestable notion of vicarious redemption offered in the New Testament, the central parable of Christianity, in a grisly echo of the binding of Isaac, glorifies child sacrifice: “For God so loved the world that he **gave his only begotten son** that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”\n\nFurthermore, think on the ongoing questionable practices of gay reform camps, or religious educational institutions. Not just historically, but today, too, kids are pawns in adults’ games. Watch the documentaries *For the Bible Tells Me So* and *Jesus Camp*. Very eye-opening.\n\nAs the immutable Christopher Hitchens would so often say, “Morality does not come from religion; rather, religion steals its morality from humanism, takes the credit, and hopes you won’t notice.” Christianity’s treatment of children is, it would seem, of mixed flavors - sometimes sweet, sometimes sour. Better to remember *everything* Christianity has to say on children than simply cherry-pick the nice bits from gentle Jesus meek and mild.\n\n***\n\nThoughts?",

I do remember speaking to you about the difference between an atheist and an agnostic.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is the book I referenced.\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Dear-Agnos-A-Defense-Christianity/dp/0801041562\n&gt;  \n&gt; In this book the author begins by describing the situation in which the atheist finds himself when he proclaims \"There is no God\".\n&gt;  \n&gt; In order for the atheist to firmly and truthfully make this claim he would have to have seen everything, been everywhere and know everything for all time (not just the present). For the one thing he has not seen might be God. Or God may be in the one place he has not been. Or God is simply the one thing he does not know.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In effect in order to say confidently that there is NO God, one would have to BE God: omniscient, omnipresent, etc. Since the atheist has not been everywhere, seen everything and does not KNOW everything, he cannot say truthfully that there is NO God.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Therefore, he should step back and become an \"agnostic\". This is one who says \"I do not know.\" And since he does not \"know\" if there is a God or not, Arlie J. Hoover recommends that the agnostic be \"quiet\" on the subject of God. After all once you have confessed you don't really know, what else is there to say?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; This is one of the arguments made in this book in the first chapter. The rest of the book is a defense of faith in God, arguments for the agnostic to read and consider.\n\nI'd rather not get too caught up in the whole \"you can be an agnostic atheist/not all atheists are gnostic\" thing and use the idea that in order to be atheist you have to know everything to my advantage, specifically on his perspective on other gods/religions.\n\nHere's what I have so far as a response:\n\n&gt; I remember you describing the difference between an agnostic and an atheist. Other than that I recall you mentioning historical evidence, particularly the empty tomb, and whether or not the disciples would die for something that wasn't true (or something along those lines).\n&gt; \n&gt; When I say I am agnostic, that's not exclusive to Christianity; it applies to all other religions as well. So I would like to ask you: when it comes to other gods, say Vishnu, just as an example, would you consider yourself to be atheist or agnostic?\n\nIdeas on what else to say? Am I wasting my time by going about this the wrong way? Any thoughts you guys and gals have is appreciated.",

Almost as if the vagueness helps. \n\nThere can be comfort in the word itself, even if it does not mean anything actually false. \n\nAs we've seen in this sub and often in ourselves, the transition from indoctrinated religious follower to free-thinking atheist can sometimes be quite sad, if not wholly depressing. \n\nMaybe the word 'god' isn't the problem, maybe it's just the popular definition of it being controlled by those who perpetuate lies and oppression. \n\nCan it evolve into something actually righteous and good? \n\nSome have criticized the use of the word as pointing to the unknown as having an ever-shrinking technical meaning...

He basically discredits the entire human population's ability to make rational decisions! He discredits us from believing anything in the entire world can be \"true.\" And then, he says that either we accept that we know nothing, or we believe what we \"know\", and that's apparently GOD, because our ancestors used to believe in God. It's the most fucked up logic I've ever heard in my life! WHAT. How did my friend read this and love the book? I can't even believe people are writing logic like this. It's like someone is just twisting words to make up something that resembles logical flow and promotes what they want. It's literally sickening.\n\nAnyway sorry for that.. I've been so pissed since I've read this bullshit. It's just garbage. \n\nThanks for reading if you did, and have an awesome day! ",

        "text": "I hope this is an acceptable forum. I wanted to share some information about a close friend. I just found out that he died this morning. He was only 45. It stems from cycling accident that occurred in February. I am in shock and it doesn’t feel real.\n\n\n\nWe met about 17 years ago, as then we were both hired at a small community college. I taught chemistry while he taught philosophy. He was a very rational person—almost Spock-like. He was very good at teaching, loved life and had a great sense of humor. Back then, he began playing chess. He was awful at first, but quickly progressed and would frequently beat me. He was also an atheist. I was probably more agnostic at the time, and we would have discussions about theism and such. I learned a lot from him such as the [ontological argument]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument). I also learned about how the concept of *free will* does not jibe with an all-powerful, all-knowing deity. If we have free will, then god has given up some of his all-knowingness. One particular time, we were talking about a student taking a day off for religious reasons. I was trying to argue that it was a reasonable thing for a student to do, but he pulled the “reducto ad absurdum” destroying my argument by reducing it to the fact that anyone could claim to have any sort of “religious experience” which could then not be verified. He was also fun at boring college meetings. We would often exchange messages on paper (and later by text) pointing out some of the absurdities of the inner-workings of a public institution. Outside of work, he also enjoyed good beer and coffee, but his true passion was cycling. He loved to cycle in his spare time. Sadly, he suffered a brain injury when he fell in February. He recovered physically, but his mind was not what it was. I was able to visit him once for dinner. I found his personality and wit were still there. He carried on conversation, but it wasn’t entirely meaningful. I asked him if he was still an atheist and he responded most affirmatively. So he died this morning. His mind is gone and so he no longer exists. He leaves behind many friends and family, a wife and two young boys. We will all miss him greatly.\n\n---\n**edit:** Thanks to all for taking your time to read my story. I appreciate all the warm comments.",

        "text": "I'm really having a difficult time with emotions this weekend.  I'm wanting to just yell at people that \"I told you so\" over this entire Josh Duggar thing, but from the few that I've listened to talk about their feelings publicly, I know that I would only make people really angry and get into heated debates.  I'm so burned out with political and religious debates, that I'm seriously considering moving to another country.  When I say that, I'm not joking.  I'm dead serious.  It's that bad.\n\nI grew up in one of those extreme fundamentalist Christian homes.  I've been here for awhile and I know that some have had it worse but I know that many can relate to what I went through.  For me, the entire belief that was indoctrinated in me about sex, relationships, intimacy, and what \"love\" actually was is something that has had an amazingly negative effect in my life.\n\nI was one of the boys that took that whole chastity vow thing.  I was saving myself for marriage.  I wasn't allowed to date.  I had friends that were girls and when my parents thought that I was getting too close to a girl, they would cut it off.  No good-bye's.  Just \"don't talk to her anymore\".  That was it.  End of story.  Game over.\n\nDuring my school years after puberty, I never had any romantic or physical interaction with a girl.  I never hugged or kissed a girl.  I never held hands.  I never went on dates.  I didn't go to prom.  I never went to any school dances because they were \"of the Devil\".  I was kept out of sex ed classes because my parents were against it.  So that entire week, I was absent from school during those classes.\n\nIn gym class, I couldn't wear shorts but had to wear sweat pants because shorts were seen as being objects of a sexual nature.  I never owned a pair of shorts until I was in college.  I was taught that women were meant to be submissive to the men and that the men were the head of the households.  Men made the decisions, with input from the wife.  Wives were to be submissive.  You could only date someone if the Pastor approved.  Women didn't need education because all they needed to know what to do was work in the home and take care of the home, children, and be submissive to their husbands.\n\nThe Pastor at the church, along with my step-Father, was dead set against me attending college.  They stated that if I went to college, I would lose my salvation.  \n\nThey were right.\n \nWhen I got to college, the first semester, I was a loner but my major made it very difficult to be unknown.  I was the weird kid that studied Voice.  Yeah, I was an Opera Singer.  So here was this Black kid, from a super-religious family, that toted his Bible everywhere, who could sing and was asked to be a soloist for a very big performance.  So this kid who had no confidence, was suddenly getting accolades and ATTENTION from females.  I formed a friendship with a Jewish girl (who is still very dear to me 31 years later) who was a fellow music major studying to be a teacher and she introduced me to her friends.  One of the biggest moments in my life was going to her dorm room and being in the room with 2 girls.  I didn't know what to do.  I was 18 years old, a virgin, had never been on a date, never kissed a girl, and here I was in the dorm room of 2 girls.  I was amazed.  I didn't get a disease.  My penis didn't fall off as I thought it would.  \n\nOver time, as I got more comfortable, I let my guard down more and more and I befriended more and more females.  I had my first beer when I was 19.  I was scared to death.  I had decided to stop going to church because I found out that people weren't evil. (I'm paraphrasing for the sake of time because I was actually thrown out of the church. I had \"backslid\" and then when refused to comply/repent, was labeled rebellious and thrown out by my step-Father.) It was a complicated situation but for the sake of discussion, I'm focusing only the sex part.\n\nThere was a Street Preacher named Brother Jed who came to the University and I got in an epic debate with him.  As someone who had been in church and indoctrinated with the Bible, every day from birth basically, I went toe-to-toe with Brother Jed and frustrated him to the point that he actually left that day.  I became something of a \"minor\" celebrity as the guy who shut down Brother Jed and I got more attention.  As someone who wasn't used to attention, it was ultimately a bad thing.\n\nI had always envisioned losing my virginity on my Wedding Night to one of the church girls.  Instead, I was in a dorm room with a girl I met at a bar.  I had absolutely no idea what to do.  I had started watching porn in the dorm because my roommate watched a lot of porn, but I got addicted to porn.  I didn't know how to masturbate and was still struggling with masturbation as \"spilling my seed\" so I never did it.  I would have wet dreams galore and just do laundry and act like nothing happened.  Never-mind that my underwear would stand up on their own.....I got my relief when I had vivid dreams of simply kissing women.\n\nLosing my virginity was a horrible experience.  I was so embarrassed.  If I lasted 30 seconds, I would brag about that.  I never saw her again.  I remember her name and what she looked like but I never saw her again after that.  It was horrific.\n\nBut that opened the floodgates.  I found a confidence that I never had before.  Beauty was a foreign concept to me since everybody dressed alike, wore the same hairstyles, and really had no individual form in the church.  I didn't realize that women were attracted to men who could sing, dance, were relatively handsome, and had a sense of humor. \n\nI became a male whore except I didn't charge.  I didn't have relationships.  I had partners.  Many of them.  Women were objects, just as I had been taught.  They were there for one purpose and one purpose only. \n\nI joined the military and things really amped up.  I found that there were women who loved military men in uniform.  Many were married.  It didn't stop me.  If she was willing, so was I.  If her husband was a fellow service-member that was deployed, it wasn't my fault that she was horny and wanted to be shagged.  I would give her what she wanted.  If we kicked it for a week, two weeks, a month...it didn't matter.  I wasn't after relationships really.  I was after just getting laid. I craved female attention and the female touch.\n\nI spent a significant amount of time in the Philippines.  For people who are sexually promiscuous, being there is like hitting the sex jackpot.  But strangely enough, I had a steady girlfriend over there and that was a place where I probably had sex with the least amount of women.  If I were to put a number on it, I would say less than 8 girls while I was there....once I was in a relationship, I would only be with that one girl.\n\nI got married to a woman who I thought my parents would approve of.  However, my sexual appetite was never satisfied and after a few years, I had an affair.  I broke that off and was good for a few years and then the Internet and chat rooms became popular.  I began with virtual sex in chat rooms and then progressed to meeting people.  I ended up getting divorced and then went crazy, hitting Swinger Clubs and getting into Cuckold relationships.  My job requires a tremendous amount of travel, (to the tune of about 100k air miles per year) and so I had access to people that were willing partners pretty much everywhere I went.  I haven't done professional porn but have done videos, photo's and had sex in public in front of an audience.  \n\nI was always searching for something in my life that would make me want to just be with one woman.  I had gone to therapy for years and for me, it simply didn't work.  So I decided to just stop having sex.  And for 2 years, I didn't have sex.  I wasn't in any relationships.  I just worked. \n\nWhile I'm not a sexual deviant, I know the things that I was taught about sex, intimacy, relationships, and gender roles are the things that started me on the path of sexual destruction.  I put myself in some very dangerous situations.  I risked a lot.  People should be taught about loving relationships.  Females aren't here to be subservient to men.  I see them as equal partners.  \n\nI don't know if I have a sexual conscience.  I'm in a committed relationship now.  I don't cheat on her and have no desire to.  I'm truly in love and I think it's a wholesome and true love, not one based on sex.  It's a long distance relationship so I've communicated with her more than any other person in my life.  I'm hopeful for our future and don't see myself with any other woman.\n\nBut this whole Duggar thing reminds me of my upbringing.  And while Josh may be one of the ones who is publicly shamed,  I would venture to say that there are hundreds, if not thousands more, of people who are sexually promiscuous and sexually abusive to others because of the things they've been taught.  What they're taught is truly what isn't natural.\n\nTL;DR:  Fundamentalist Christian became extremely sexually promiscuous because of church teachings.   Believe the forced sexual repressions and religious indoctrination were the root cause for this behavior.  ",

        "author": "StannisH",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/373dds/crisis_of_faith/",
        "text": "Hi all.\n\nEssentially, I've been having a \"crisis of faith\" in atheism recently (I know, atheism is not technically a \"faith\", but please hear me out).\n\nI feel like I'm in middle school again (19 now): questioning my beliefs, having an existential crisis, all that. I've been reading more lately and I've realized that there are many truly intelligent Christians. This got me thinking why intelligent people would believe what they do. I previously thought it was all do to not being able to accept reality/find meaning on their own. However, it seems to me, from reading Christian literature and debates, that atheists often attack either strawmen of bad arguments for Christianity. This lead me to explore Christianity more, and to discover that there are some deep thinkers on the subject.\n\nFor example, one of the main reasons I left Christianity back in middle school was that a God with human characteristics seemed to just not make sense to me: he gets angry, jealous, sends people to hell who don't worship him, etc. In particular, even now, it still bothers me to think that the majority of people would experience hell after their earthly life ends. However, this is a *human* judgement, and humans are flawed: what human can say that God's moral judgement is incorrect when by definition He is the ultimate moral arbiter? It's essentially \"his game, his rules\". Additionally, I'd add that from my study of Christianity it seems that hell is not so much a physical place as an experience of God after death (you feel complete by accepting his love or tormented from separation). \n\nAnother example: it appears to me that the bible has excellent predictive powers, particularly in the book of Revelation. For example, Christianity has declined just as it predicts. Look up \"Preterism\" on wikipedia, which essentialy states that most of the Revelation prophecy has already come to pass in the first century of Rome (Nero is considered to be the beast, Babylon is Rome, etc). It seems to me that the bible has some predictive powers.\n\nBut most importantly, I'm just scared. Everything seems so unfair. If I don't intellectually and emotionally pick right, I'm going to hell (and even if I do pick right maybe I still am) along with most of my friends and family. On the other hand, if agnosticism/atheism is more correct than I don't want to worry about this stuff. I hate how there is no way to *know* the truth. \n\nThere are smart people who are Christians and atheists, and good arguments for each. I'm so torn.\n\nI'd be extremely appreciative with whatever you guys (and gals) have to say. Perhaps some have had a similar experience. I'm not here to debate exactly, but I will bring up counterpoints as a devil's advocate in my pursuit of knowledge. \n\nThank you and god(s) bless.",

        "author": "flubweet",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/371vy1/ridiculing_religious_people_counterproductive/",
        "text": "I've been wondering recently if ridiculing the religious is counterproductive to getting people to leave their religion. I've had some discussions with others and have gotten the response:\n\nWe need to ridicule the religious leaders and parents so that they can see they are fools and so their children can see how much society disapproves of their beliefs. Maybe then the children will not believe their church/parents.\n\nNow, I'm looking at this and thinking, wait a minute, this doesn't appear to be very...logical? I know Dawkins and others have said we should ridicule and mock them but my position is this:\n\n1) Reductio ad ridiculum is (for the most part) a fallacy and thus does nothing to logically prove or disprove anything. While one fallacy does not invalidate an argument, just the fact that it is a kind of fallacy makes me think we should avoid it (so they don't have anything to use against the person making the argument).\n\n2) Ridicule and mocking can have effects that go beyond just the immediate person one is ridiculing. For instance, regardless of what one thinks ought to be the case, ridiculing the Muslims in a political cartoon can and has caused Muslims in another part of the world to go out and kill people who had no part in the cartoon. Likewise, one may ridicule someone who is psychologically on the edge and then lashes out. It seems risky, like poking a gorilla with a stick. Some gorilla's may not get mad, but I don't want to test them.\n\n3) Many religious people teach that they are to expect mocking and ridicule, so I can see ridicule actually strengthening their resolve. Also, they may say it is evidence their belief is true. I would think one would not want to give them anything to run with. It would almost be more difficult for them if someone not in their religion treated them better than anyone in their religion ever did.\n\n4) Some say ridiculing is to help the children of religious people see that their parents are considered fools in hopes they will doubt them. While that may be true in some cases, I think the fact their parents or mentors (pastors) are being mocking may cause them to grow closer to them, even holding on to their religion out of spite. Family bonds can be strong, so ridicule may actually cause those bonds to strengthen in some cases making it more difficult to convince them to leave their religion/family.\n\nThese are the reasons why I think ridicule and mocking are risky and just illogical if your goal is to lower the religious population through argument. (It is not necessarily mine, but just if it is one's own goal) Even if it causes some to leave their religion, how can one say they base their views on evidence and logic, but then use something as illogical as ridicule when they can not argue effectively. Some people won't accept your argument, but the risks and uncertainty involved with ridicule seem too great to me to justify using it in most cases if at all.\n\nWhat do you people think? ",

I am not here to talk down but to simply try to UNDERSTAND. \n\nI practice Buddhism (yes, I'm atheist, please don't ask about it because every time I do I have explain stuff and people are like,\"YOU CAN'T ATHEIST AND BUDDHIST\" despite Buddhisms complete non-theism and atheism's only definition being that one does not believe in God or Gods and Buddha wasn't a God). \n\nAnyways, I was in a bad place the other week and this guy I knew said to call him. He's a minister, and he said he was going to pray for me, and to trust him. He didn't bother asking my views, but he did it anyways. I accepted, reluctantly, because he was honestly trying to help and appreciated any help thrown my way. \n\nNow, I hail from the camp that religions and philosophies should have basic respect for each other. And when I mean basic respect I do NOT mean the modern idea of \"tolerance\". When you tolerate something, you really aren't trying to UNDERSTAND it or connect with it. And I feel understanding each other is more important than simply tolerating one another. I also feel that religions, philosophies, and people in general could and should learn a lot from each other. So I never fought it once and did what he said to do.\n\nI really appreciated it. And I've been thanking him and appreciating him in my head ever since. I will often cite the Buddhist prayer of Metta (Loving Kindness) to him in my head. It's not a traditional prayer. It's not asking for any God or whatever to bask them in glory and rewards. It's building an empathetic connection with another being. The prayer typically goes like this,\"may you be happy and free from suffering.\" Now, the entire goal of Metta is to apply this to EVERY PERSON or thing, so that you help build a connection with every waking life form and have empathy for them, even people you don't like (so suffice to say I'm doing that for him now). This is what is Buddhists call \"The Practice\". Buddhism is essentially a practice of wisdom, empathy, compassion, and more rolled into one and the goal is to PRACTICE being useful and helpful for other people to be free and content with ones life. This is the core essence of Buddhism, and Metta is one of the hardest things in the world despite its inherent simplicity. I challenge each and every one of you to say that prayer to everything you come across today, even to yourself.\n\nAnyways, I told I had been thinking of him and he was in my thoughts and that I was praying for him because of what he did. He, likely ignorance of Buddhism, took it the wrong way. He likely thinks Buddha is a God, and that a Buddhist prayer is praying to God like how Christians pray to theirs. It's not. I was trying to tell him that I enjoyed the spiritual connection and the exchange we made and that I hope everything in his life is going alright \"may you be from suffering, and may you be happy.\" How did he take it? You be the judge!\n\n&gt;I'm not Buddhist. So thanks for but no thanks. I would appreciate if you refrain from that.\n\nHuh? He certainly had no issues throwing his religiosity upon to ME. I just made a light commentary. One sentence telling him I prayed for him, and now he's scared I'm trying to turn him away from God or something. Now he refuses to speak to me and has blocked me from Facebook. Just because I told I gave him - in simple terms - a Buddhist prayer.\n\nI don't get it. It's not the first time this has happened. I don't understand how or why Christian's demand respect and for everyone to fall in line with their views, no matter the philosophy or religion. You can pray for me for twenty minutes on the phone and try to force me to believe in your God and have faith in what you're doing, but one mention of you being in my thoughts as a Buddhist makes you recoil? Christianity is not exceptionalism and the human connection is more than iconography and customs or even philosophy. One of the main takeaways from Christianity is the idea that everyone else is wrong. I have no support about me being right, as I am shaped from my own life experience. But I never seem to get the same reaction or self righteous indignation from any other religion, and it's one I simply cannot understand given the entire basis of its philosophy (Do Unto Others, the Good Samaritan;etc) \n\nThis is not a rant against Christian piety or the Christian religion but a simple social observation and an appeal for something greater. Christians would go much further with almost everyone if they did so in a manner that respected others as much as we are demanded to respect them. Unfortunately, it seems many only seem to have a mind to respect themselves. ",

        "text": "So a bit of background: I live in a south-east Asian country with, let's say, quite draconian, drugs laws. One particularly scary 'feature' of the law here is that drug possession applies not just to anything that may be on your person or in your luggage, but also to whatever may be dissolved in your blood or urine.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis time last year we were coming back from a party overseas and one of my friends was picked up at the airport. We all went through customs, realised she was no longer with us, next we heard was she was in a police cell (basically guilty until proven innocent here) charged with drug consumption / possession-after-the-fact and awaiting the results of a urine test.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo the urine test comes back positive for MDMA (she maintains her drink was spiked, by the way) and my friend gets a year in jail. Depending on individual circumstances this can actually mean a full year in jail, six months in jail then six months on tagged release with curfew, or as in my friend's case, six months in jail followed by six months in what they call a \"half way house\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor the first two weeks my friend is not allowed any visitors - not even her parents. After which visitation is restricted to immediate family but she's able to write a limited number of letters. So after about two months of gleaning what little information we can via her sister, my friends and I receive a letter from her. So for the next few months we each write to her individually on a regular basis (big group, about 10 of us) and she replies to the group as she's limited in how many letters she's allowed to write. During this time she actually sounds fairly positive all things considered - however at this point she doesn't know for sure, but she's hopeful she'll be released on tagged curfew after six months.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen the six months is up she finds out that she's being transferred to this \"half way house\" place for the remaining six months. She's disappointed not to be getting out but hey at least it's better than jail, right? We're still not allowed to visit her but she's allowed to write as many letters as she wants. Her first letter to the group immediately sets off alarm bells for me. It's laden with guilt and remorse; how she 'made a terrible mistake' but she's gradually 'coming to terms' with it, and most disturbing of all \"I feel that god has a plan for me\". \"Bible studies\" features highly on the list of activities there, along with baking and crafts for church sales. The whole thing stinks of the 12 step program.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo we write back and forth quite frequently for the next few months. All letters in and out are vetted so it's kept fairly platitudinous. I make a point of not responding to any of the unnerving shit she wrote initially, instead talking about what I've been up to, her plans for when she's released etc. I find out she's able to receive books. First I considered sending her my copy of The God Delusion, but figured it would be a waste as there was no way they'd allow it through. In the end I sent her another Dawkins book, The Magic of Reality, which did get through after being vetted by a \"psychiatrist\". That they let this book through actually placated me somewhat; maybe it's not as bad as I'd feared?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo fast forward a couple more months and my friend's release date approaches. For the last 4 weeks or so she’s allowed to go out and work during the day and given her phone back while she’s out. Immediately starts spewing bible verses and other odious, indoctrinated nonsense onto Facebook.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor a bit of context, we actually had a pretty deep discussion of all manner of things religion, superstition, spirituality and whatnot after the party, the very day before she was arrested. We didn't get into terminology or labels at the time but I would consider her an agnostic deist with some latent cultural Buddhist / Chinese superstitions; not a cold, hard, sceptical atheist but definitely not a Christian or Abrahamic-theist, either.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe's just been released and we'll be catching up shortly. I obviously want to discuss this stuff; to find out how badly they got to her and start to try talking some sense back into her. But I'm also very aware that she's been through a really shitty time and she's going to be fragile and have trust issues that will take time to get over.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHas anyone had experience of anything like this? Did the brainwashing gradually fade, or has my friend been permanently fucked up? How would you suggest I approach this tactfully but firmly? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\ntl;dr - agnostic / freethinking friend got arrested for drugs, sent to xian rehab / indoctrination centre, force-fed Jesus Kool-Aid and came out spouting bible verses. Need advice. \n\nEdit: paragraph spacing. ",

So, I have my own feelings about terrorists, but they are just feelings. When I argue, I pretty much only argue from a standpoint of cause and effect, not morality. Well, apparently they REALLY don't like that. They constantly talk about how evil terrorism is and if I try to steer them away from using moral language and instead look at the practical side of what to do, they get very upset. Then they call me irrational and unreasonable for not accepting their moral convictions. It seems very illogical to me. Has anyone else encountered this? ",

        "text": "I take care of a young man with mild autism and he is very religious (southern baptist), in fact, we grew up in the same church. I have to bring him to a church group discussion that meets every Wednesday evening and I have been doing this the whole time I have been working with him (almost a year).\n\nAfter years of doubt I finally realized I was an atheist about 2 years ago and I have slowly come out to my family about it.  That wasn't easy but we have an understanding and are still very close and loving. However, my job as a caregiver for a very religious autistic young man with very religious parents means that I have to keep my unbelief a secret around them or else I would lose my job. \n\nBack to the church group meeting, normally I just sit quietly and tune it out or play on my phone. However, last night I just couldn't keep from speaking up and that isn't good because once I get going it is very difficult for me to keep my opinions in check (especially about fundamentalist Christianity). Now, the topic of the evening was \"how can god allow suffering?\" They all start saying that everything happens in order for god to be glorified, that we have free will and a sinful nature which causes us to hurt eachother and that's not gods fault. Also, that even the worse things imaginable are not gods fault but are still according to his will (completely nonsensical wishful thinking).\n\nThey talked about disease for the most part but I brought up the topic of rape. I said since god is all powerful and all knowing and benevolent wouldn't he stop a rape? I said that I can see no way for god to be glorified through sexual violence (I had to tread lightly because I have to pretend to be a believer). They came back at me saying that he works in mysterious ways, that he would never want someone to be raped, that it's the fault of the rapist exercising his free will, that we cant comprehend gods ways because he is perfect and all knowing and we are not and blah blah blah. \n\nIt was just infuriating to me how they used mental gymnastics to keep from admitting what is plainly evident. That if god was real and had the same attributes that they believe he has there is no way that he wouldn't intervene to stop suffering. Also, I wanted to say how come whenever something good happens it was because of god but whenever something bad happens it wasn't god it was our sinful nature that caused the problem. Disgusting. Thanks for letting me vent Reddit. I have many many more points and arguments about religion. I could talk about it all day so feel free to post comments.",

Maybe this wont matter al all since you wont be revived to realize the time past. But Maybe it does. We dont really Know what happens at the end since gravitation contradicts quantum mechanics and the M theory seems Just philosofical fantasy. Id like to think our big bang is just one of an infinity of singularities. And since time Would be eternal one every an unimaginable number of times, our consciousness Would reappear. This Would be instantaneous for us since we cant perceive time when we are dead. This helps me cope with death as an atheist even though iltry to live to the fullest my life.What do you think?\nEDIT: So what I've gathered from here is that even if the universe did repeat itself and your consciousness reapeared it would be a different entity from the one you had in the first universe which makes sense. My consciousness exists as a proyection of my brain interacting with the world. Even if the world looks exactly the same, it is not the same world but as my consciousness isnt something physical I cant say if that'd be me. It would have no direct connection with me so maybe it wouldnt be really me. This is more of a philosophical question. Thanks for your input guys,even if most of you didnt agree with me, but I guess that was the point haha.",

You can *believe* (internal) whatever you like, so long as you *worship* (external) Jesus.\n\nI know that because it's a private school, it doesn't violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms as applied to law.

So far here’s what I could find and please tell me if I need to add another:\n\n-\tYou can’t judge or compare based a sample size of one :\nWe only know of one design and that’s Human design which we see frequently in our daily lives. We have no Knowledge of other kinds of design. Human design operates on relatively small objects in a relatively small time using limited materials and skill. The design argument is often applied to all life or the entire universes, both of which are vast, ancient and mind boggling in scope. Such a creator would require vast resources, knowledge and skill, making it quite unlike a human.\n-\t It’s not rational to extend our daily experience to the universe as a whole. \nAn argument from analogy holds only if similarities are more than its differences. The universe as a whole is counter intuitive ,it negates much of our previous assertions (starting with the earth being round, evolution of the eye, the big bang…). \n-\t An infinite god can never be demonstrated from finite phenomena. Immanuel Kant criticized all the physico-theological arguments, including the argument from design, saying: \n\"The transcendental idea of a necessary and all-sufficient being is so immeasurably great, so high above all that is empirical, which is always conditioned, that we hope in vain to find materials in the sphere of experience sufficiently ample for our conception, and in vain seek the unconditioned among things that are conditioned, while examples, nay, even guidance is denied us by the laws of empirical synthesis. [...] This proof can at most, therefore, demonstrate the existence of an architect of the world, whose efforts are limited by the capabilities of the material with which he works, but not of a creator of the world “\n-\tComplexity and design (that it implies design)     \n1-This is a quintessential argument from incredulity. Complexity usually means something is hard to understand. But the fact that one cannot understand how something came to be does not indicate that one may conclude it was designed. On the contrary, lack of understanding indicates that we must not conclude design or anything else.    \n2- Irreducible complexity and complex specified information are special cases of the \"complexity indicates design\" claim; they are also arguments from incredulity.    \n3- In the sort of design that we know about, simplicity is a design goal. Complexity arises to some extent through carelessness or necessity, but engineers work to make things as simple as possible. This is very different from what we see in life.    \n4- Complexity arises from natural causes: for example, in weather patterns and cave formations. \nComplexity is poorly defined.   \n-\tYou can be made of stupid parts and still design things.   \nFrom an impromptu talk by Mark F. Sharlow (What’s Really Wrong with the Argument from Design?)    \n… A natural process consisting entirely of small, mechanistic events can produce a real design.  It\nhappens all the time.  The human brain does it.  There is nothing illogical or self-contradictory\nabout a natural process, made up of stupid little mechanistic steps, creating a design.       \n\nIf we truly take this fact to heart, evolution begins to look a little different.  After all, what is the\nmain reason for thinking that the products of natural selection are not designed?   The most\nobvious reason is that the apparent design in nature is merely a product of natural processes made\nup of tiny mechanistic steps with no one in charge.  No one external to nature engineered those\nsteps.  They’re just natural, spontaneous little events that add up to the process we call evolution    \n— the grand, magnificent process that produces these things that appear to be designed.   Critics of the argument from design sometimes say that because things came into being that way    \n— by purely mechanistic processes internal to nature instead of by someone’s supernatural\noversight      \n— the things produced by those evolutionary processes couldn’t really be designed.    \nHowever, if we applied this standard to our mental processes instead of to the evolutionary\nprocess, we would find that nothing that the human brain creates is really designed!  The objects\nthat people design are produced by natural processes that are combinations of small, mechanistic\nevents.  The complex objects in nature are produced by natural processes that are combinations\nof small, mechanistic events.  Living beings and other complex natural structures arise from such\nprocesses without outside intervention   \n — but this does not automatically imply that these   \nstructures are not real designs!  If it did imply this, then we could also conclude that the\nstructures produced by human brains are not real designs    \n— so people never design anything!   \n\n- Design shows that there is no god.      \n\nHere’s a problem for design arguments. The best examples of design that we know that might allow us to develop a teleological argument for God are instances where we designed and created artifacts. Then we can identify the properties that are present in those artifacts in virtue our intelligent design. To the extent that the universe possesses those properties, we can then argue that the universe was designed as well. Any properties that we would find in the universe that might suggest that it as an artifact will be properties that we have observed in artifacts that we have created. But the properties that we find in our artifacts that indicate that they were created all directly or indirectly reveal our limitations, our inabilities, and other finite aspects of our creation. So the properties indicative of creation that we might find in the universe will also point to limitations, inabilities, and finite aspects of the creator of the universe.     \n\nThat is, our best examples of artifact creation are anthropomorphic—they reflect our limited natures. So if we find features in the universe that harkens to human creation, at best, they will suggest an anthropomorphic, non-divine creator. But if God really does exist, then the universe was not created by a limited, unable, finite being, and the markers of intelligent design in it will not resemble our own. If an infinitely powerful and intelligent being created the universe, then results of its creative act will not resemble the results of our finite efforts. So pointing to anthropomorphic design features in the universe actually suggests that God, a divine being who would be capable of much more, was not responsible. And if God did not create the universe, that suggests that God does not exist. \nIt’s a bit like the old Groucho Marx line, “I wouldn’t want to be a member of any club who would have me as a member.” If the design features in the universe are ones that we can recognize from our perspective, then the being responsible must not be God. God wouldn’t do such shoddy work that we’d be able to see the seams, nails, and construction evidence. So if we can see the evidence of construction, then God wasn’t the one who did the job. Furthermore, it’s an all or nothing gig for God—either he created the universe, or there is no God. There are no in between alternatives. So if we can see design in the universe, then there is no God.   \n\n- Examples of poor design.\n\nI gathered these from Talkorigin and Talkdesign websites. Proving the negative blog, Iron chariots wiki and heme's objections to design.\n\nWhat else?\n",

        "text": "Mad Men, with it's finale, explains the underlying modern American ethos. For any non-American who wants to understand America better, watch Mad Men. You see, in the end, the characters of the show realize the most important thing in life is their own happiness, and to find that, they need to find and embrace their own identity.\n\nJoan realizes that for years she had based her status on men, but that's not who she was. She was an independent leader, who wanted to call her own shots. So she finds happiness in ignoring what Commander Pike wants and setting out on her own. Don finally fully embraces Don Draper, ad exec extraordinaire as his identity, and creates the biggest ad of the 70s. Peggy realizes she wants recognition at work but also a family life. Stan helps her see there's a balance to be found. That's Peggy's identity: someone who wants to be appreciated, both at work and in her personal life. That's the modern American ethos. Figuring out your own path and walking down it is the best thing to do, regardless of what others tell you.\n\nWhat does this have to do with religion? I think that great American desire to find one's own identity and embrace it is why people find religion in this country. Religion means identity. If you join a church, you have found your identity, and can find happiness by embracing it. That's why it's so hard for people to leave. If a baptist leaves his church, who is he? So we have to understand as atheists what we're doing when we try and argue against religion. To them, we're trying to dismantle their identity and thus take away their happiness. I think, (as a non-expert, so take my pop-psychology nonsense with a grain of salt) that's the root of why America is so damn religious (and partisan as well. Lots of people find identity with their politics. Proof that shows my ideology is wrong would take away my own identity and therefore happiness).\n\nI don't think this is the only reason someone becomes religious, but it's a very powerful reason to join and an even more powerful reason to stay.\n\nThoughts? I know religion = identity isn't a groundbreaking discovery, I'm just trying to tie this concept into why religion is so powerful in the US. Now, as to how this philosophy came about would require a historian's input.\n\n(Oh, and for any philosophy nerds reading, I guess I'm defining happiness as a lasting personal feeling of contentment and fulfillment here. I'm not trying to fuel that debate about what happiness really is or should be, I'm just saying I think that's what an American's idea of it is.)",

These channels include The Pulse, The Blend, 70's on 7, 80's on 8 and lastly.... The Message. \n\nI'm so put-off, and quite frankly pissed, that they play this music for my 10 hour shift. I have voiced my concerns with co-workers and they agree that it's not a great choice for motivational music. \n\nMy question to /r/TrueAtheism is this: How do I go about getting them to stop playing this station without getting reprimanded (I do live in the bible belt)?",
