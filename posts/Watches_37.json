        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/11k09zs/daily_news_farer_might_have_just_made_the_best/",
        "text": "It's Monday, so there's a few things that happened over the weekend:\n\n# What's new\n\n[Farer has just come out with the best moonphase watch on the market](https://wornandwound.com/farer-moonphase-is-all-farer-and-all-moon/)\n\n/ Farer introduces the Moonphase collection and I assume people are already drowning them in money. 38.5mm cushion case, 10.5mm thick. The sides have a “grain twist” imprint texture and the watch is powered by the hand-wound Sellita SW216-1.\n\nBut where the watch gets really interesting is the enormous moon depicted within the aperture that dominates the top half of the dial. There's three models and the moon itself differs between each of the watches, going from light pink in the Burbidge, to warm yellow in the Halley, and finally a neutral eggshell in the Eddington. The moons  are hand-painted in Geneva using grade OL X1 Super-LumiNova, so you know they will be shiny\n\nWhy is it the best moonphase? Because it's only $1,640.\n\n[Are we getting a solid gold MoonSwatch?](https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/theres-a-new-gold-moonswatch-coming)\n\n/ Love them or hate them, there’s no denying the MoonSwatch turned the industry on it’s head last year. I’m pretty sure we won’t know what the ramifications of Swatch putting out this watch out will be for years to come, but it has made huge changes.\n\nNow, when we thought they were either done with the collection, they’re teasing something new: “Mission to Moonshine Gold, March 7”. There’s some people out there thinking it’s going to be a solid gold MoonSwatch. That’s highly unlikely. What is likely is that it will be a very fun watch. However, what we would appreciate more is THEM STOCKING ENOUGH WATCHES TO START SELLING THEM ONLIN, instead of introducing new variants.\n\n[The Lorca Watches Model No.1 is a sexy watch coming from a very unlikely source](https://www.fratellowatches.com/introducing-the-lorca-watches-model-no-1-gmt/)\n\n/ Lorca watches is an upstart from New York that has been showing off their first watch for a couple of months now. Glimpses of ti have been seen online and people have reviewed them. The first model is going sale tomorrow. I don’t want to write too much about it. Please, click on the link above, as well as this link right here, to read the whole story of Lorca. It’s a wild ride.\n\n[Tissot is on a tear](https://www.fratellowatches.com/tissot-seastar-1000-40mm-models/)\n\n/ Need an affordable, dependable, quartz, stylish and rugged watch? Why would you look anywhere else than Tissot. It’s got all of that covered with three 40mm additions to the Seastar 1000 line. Three colors - standard black, navy blue, and black with yellow gold PVD accents - steel bracelets and a silicone strap. Yours for $425.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# On hand - a selection of reviews\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Frederique Constant Highlife Worldtimer Manufacture almost looks like a budget version of a Vacheron overseas. And that’s a good thing](https://escapementmagazine.com/articles/frederique-constant-highlife-worldtimer-manufacture.html/)\n\n[Never underestimate how much joy a G-Shock can bring you](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/watch-review-casio-g-shock-frogman-gwfa1000apf1a/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Watch Worthy - A look at an offbeat, less known watch you might actually like\n\n[Jules Verne inspired adventures on the high seas](https://timeandtidewatches.com/micro-mondays-the-horizon-pilgrim-is-a-diver-inspired-by-drama-on-the-high-seas/)\n\nThe Pilgrim comes from a relatively new Singapore-based micro brand Horizon. The watchmaker says it’s a diver inspired by the adventure writings of Jules Verne, but what we want to point out is the most perfectest position of a date window in all of watches. Just look at it and shed a tear.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis post is part of an experiment to see how watch news changes on a daily basis.

Would you wait until you can afford to get the watch you've always wanted or find another shortcut or substitute to get what you want? This question commonly applies with Rolex the most for obvious reasons. But it can apply for other watches. But its more than that.\n\nWould you rather get the same watch model but in used condition for lower price, or get brand new?\n\nOr are you going to save up for a Rolex Submariner instead of a Tudor BB58?\n\nOr maybe getting a Breitling Super Chronomat over a Longines Spirit Zulu Time?\n\nOr another one is, if you've always wanted a Rolex, and the Sub is your choice but you have the opportunity to get an OP instead?\n\nWhat are your takes on this? Would you rather sit and wait than get an alternative later on and hope you'd never have to regret and ponder without a watch of your choice? So you'd just force yourself to bond with said alternative watch? Those are the questions and discussions.",

Most recommendations point towards a Hamilton and I also seriously considered purchasing one but when I found out about the SRPG series which I can get locally for $150 (almost half the price of the cheapest manual wind Khaki Field I can find) I went with the Seiko instead.\n\n\nI really love the simplicity of the design and how it pairs with a NATO strap. I've swapped out the original cream colored strap for this olive one that has a nice shine to it. Although Seiko's website says this comes with Lumi Brite, it's lume is a lot weaker and takes much longer to \"charge\" than my SSK005 GMT. Any one else have similar experiences?",
