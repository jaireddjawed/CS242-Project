        "text": "I've been fascinated by some of the new urbanist communities that are being built in exurban areas.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* [Hendrick Farm](https://www.hendrickfarm.ca) in Chelsea, Quebec outside of Ottawa\n* [Serenbe](http://serenberealestate.com) outside of Atlanta\n* [Carlton Landing](https://www.carltonlanding.com) in Oklahoma\n\nI was wondering how people feel about these communities. They have their obvious pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n* Typically have a diversity of housing types as well as diversity of style\n* Higher quality design than typical exurbs/suburbs\n* Mixed uses means there are typically some local amenities within walking distance\n* Lots of green space, trails, etc\n* Often have an agricultural component\n\nCons:\n\n* Not usually transit connected\n* Whatever businesses exist there are primarily staffed by people who can't afford to live there\n* Limited employment opportunities for residents\n* Typically only a small number of amenities within walking distance so car dependence is still present\n\nOn the surface these communities are likely very appealing for many people. They're certainly visually appealing. I love the diversity of housing styles that Serenbe offers for instance - it's hardly the typical generic suburb. But they don't solve many urban planning problems - they're basically a very nice place for upper middle class people to live. That's not a terrible thing by any means, but are they too close to typical suburbs and exurbs to be considered a success of urban planning?",

I see the ways that my client's lives are heavily impacted by the housing crisis, transportation issues, and food access. I want to get a master's degree in planning to work on those issues and the health inequities embedded in them. I have taken on some work with policy and really enjoy it. I'm interested in a MPA because it might increase my upward mobility potential as well as give me more influence in policies. I'm interested in a MPH because ultimately my goal with getting a master's of planning is to address health inequities. \n\nWhich concurrent degree would be best in your opinion? ",

        "text": "Why I love New Urbanism \\(aka \"Eco\\-cities\"\\).\n\nSuburbia houses a million people in 400 square miles. New Urbanism only takes 40 square miles.\n\nSuburbia is car based and creates traffic jams, and takes 30 minutes to drive to a mega\\-mall, park your car and walk to your shop. New Urbanism offers almost everything you need in a 5 minute walk. A New Urban front door is closer to the action than your car\\-park is to your final destination in the mega\\-mall, and they make you drive through Sydney traffic to get to the mall!\n\nSuburban mega\\-malls service about half a million people over a wide area and are congested and anonymous and soulless, leaving no \"there\" there in suburbia. New Urban town squares service the local 18,000 people and not only supply most of your goods and services, but often spontaneously meet your social needs as well. They are intimate places buzzing with social life, with \\*locals\\* buying coffee, reading the paper, sitting in the park, or getting their groceries. Kids love it, because there are always other kids to play with in the town square park. Adults love it, because there are always other mums and dads there to share watching the kids. It offers something we've forgotten how to do \\- neighbourhood. Community. It's environmental, healthy, and convenient. It has the charm and friendly atmosphere of the small town while plugging into the convenience and jobs of the big city. Think of an old European town square, or \"Stars Hollow\" from the Gilmore Girls or even \"Durant\" from Longmire. Try this 4 minute video summary.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGJt\\_YXIoJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGJt_YXIoJI)",

Personally, my Master's is in Sustainability with a focus/cert in the program on Green Building and Community Design. The way I see it is - I aim to plan with a focus on Sustainability rather than in general.\nWhy I ask is, though I've never claimed to be a planner, I saw this meme: https://twitter.com/Dick_Florida/status/994197373835456513\n\nAnd thought \"Maybe people don't want to the opinion of non-planners?\" That hasn't dissuaded me from doing what I want. I work for a Clean Energy organization, we work with cities, I enjoy what I do. But is there a perception that we're interlopers?\n\nAnd my second question is: If we are, does the community run the risk of being too myopic? According to the guy who wrote Urban Planning for Dummies, \"If the average person doesn’t get involved, it doesn’t work well.\"\n\nSo I guess I'm throwing this out there. I even noticed this subreddit gave flare to real planners. What is a non-planner to do?!?!",

        "text": "By a \"licensed pop-up patio\" I mean an establishment that is licensed to serve liquor and light bar snacks. I imagine the coolers/some sort of water pump system to be contained in a portable unit. Ropes and fences around the \"bar\" would be a way to minimize the flow of minors from entering and exiting. \n\nBut the sole purpose would be to take an underused street with great sun exposure and convert it into a destination for an afternoon/evening. \n\nObviously there are challenges, mainly being Alberta Gaming and Liquor Licensing, bylaws in Edmonton do not allow for these types of patios, lack of proper toilets. \n\nBut has this sort of establishment been attempted else where that I over-looked? \n\nWhat other possible problems could be associated? \n\nI am mostly curious because I think it would be an interesting way to create hype and an activity in Edmonton throughout the summer months.
