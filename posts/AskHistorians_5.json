Immediately afterwards it flew into the sky. Those who saw the phenomenon became numb and began to mourn and to shout in Greek, \"Lord have mercy! The light itself ascended into the sky\"!  \nThe historian and eyewitness Frantzis reports:  \n\"A shining light came down from heaven and covered it all night.\" This different light was seen for the first time time on Good Friday, March 30, 1453, during the procession of the epitaph. On that day, Muhammad's army had already approached the surrounding hills, behind the Bosphorus, and part of it was advancing towards the Thracian plain.  \nThis unknown, heavenly and uninterpretable light spread its glow over the Queen, as if somehow covering her. Later this light stood directly above Hagia Sophia and stayed  \nthere all night. This unprecedented event continued throughout the days of the siege.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan this be verified? Were there really lights like this in Constantinople? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://perseasorion.blogspot.com/2019/08/blog-post.html](https://perseasorion.blogspot.com/2019/08/blog-post.html)",

There seems to be quite a few for Europe (ie **Kershaw**\\`s two books for Penguin (ie \"*to Hell and Back*\" - actually there are many such Penguin books), **Hobsbawm**\\`s \"*Age of X*\" books (not entirely Europe, but very heavy on Europe)), Latin America (**Chasteen** \"*Born in Blood and Fire*\"), Africa (**Iliffe** \"*Africans the History of a Continent*\"), Southeast Asia (**Lieberman** \"*Strange Parallels*\"), and Middle East (ie **Lewis** \"*The Middle East: A Brief History*\" or **Hodgson** \"*Ventures of Islam*\").  Most of these I found on the AH book list, but can\\`t find anything homologous for East Asia there.  \n\n\nI like these kinds of books, as I feel they help contextualize developments in any one country within its region (ie Peronism as a form of Latin American populism).  However, I'm struggling to find books about East Asia (ie Koreas, China, Taiwan, Japan, and southeast Asia (except \"Strange Parallels\").  Some general history books (ie Darwin\\`s \"After Tamerlane\") help give some scope here, but I want something more focused on the region itself.  I\\`m interested in the 20th century, although if there is a book that has a different starting point (ie Opium Wars or Meiji Reforms, perhaps) this is fine too.",

I turned round instantly – to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into infantry who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so it is true that once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This is what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.\n\nI'm particularly curious about the line \"resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves.\" I understand a man on horseback chopping downwards has a significant advantage over a man on foot stabbing upwards. It just seems a bit of a stretch to say the cavalry had no risk, and that the infantry bayonets were useless.\n\nWas Captain Duthilt exaggerating for effect, or was it really that one sided?",

        "text": "The Ontario border follows the Ottawa River until approximately 45°34'03.0\"N 74°23'04.4\"W, at which point it begins to turn southwest and heads inland until 45°18'09.6\"N 74°28'20.0\"W until it turns southeast to the St. Lawrence River, which it then follows for the southern border.\n\nThis carves out a landmass, today known as the Vaudreuil-Soulanges Regional County Municipality, as being a part of Quebec.  I have read (on a historical placard posted at one of the Ontario-Quebec land border crossings) that the line was based upon seigneuries established by New France.  What I have not been able to find an answer to is how this particular landmass, the only part of Quebec south of the Ottawa River and disconnected from the rest of mainland Quebec, ended up as a part of Quebec.  There's no distinguishing geographical feature that follows the Ontario-Quebec land border.  If it even followed a muddy creek at least, then it would make sense; but there's nothing that shows why the line was drawn the way it was.\n\nDoes anybody have the answer at to why Quebec was able to claim a land area along this specific line?",

These road trails already existed when the Portuguese arrived in what is now Brazil. And several cities and outposts were founded at strategic points along these ancient roads. These roads supposedly connected the Incas, the various tribes along the Brazilian coast, and various other peoples across the Amazon and south of the South American continent. What do we really know about Peaberu's paths? Can theories that these paths lead to trails created by large extinct fauna more than 10,000 years ago be taken seriously? Were these paths routes of intense trade between Andean peoples and peoples from the east coast of the continent? What facts can we say about the history of the peabiru path?",
