The only other time I can think of is when I was trying to figure out if humans are the only species that can choke to death on their food. (Which I still don't have the answer to even after reading a few different Reddit threads asking the same question)...\n\nBut back on to the topic at hand, I am pretty confident that insects such as flies experience time slower than humans and other larger animals, which is why they can react so quickly, or at least what we perceive as quickly, and I would guess the confusion in the different articles stems from the fact that experiencing time slower makes that particular organism quicker and possess a much faster reaction time compared to larger organisms such as ourselves... So perceiving time slower = faster reflexes and reaction time.",

The main thing I am interested in is how Rho GTPases (mainly Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA) impact neuronal development and how certain factors such as neurotrophins or neurotransmitters might influence it (mainly BDNF and glutamate, to a lesser extent serotonin). \n\nMy issue is that I am a first year student and the classes I have do not delve that deep into the more scientific part, so up until now all my knowledge has been accumulated by reading the available literature and what my supervisor has sent me. \n\nI have been having difficulties trying to pinpoint one potential signalling cascade I’m interested in (I mean just the fact that I’m looking at three gtpases is a lot) so I started seeing that knowledge in systems biology is useful, and it can also help decipher data and give me some mental structure. I found a specialization on coursera and courses for transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics and metabolomics on a website called CBEHx. They aren’t necessarily cheap but I have no other ideas to educate myself properly, so I was curious if you think they would be just a waste of time and money. \n\nAs a disclaimer I am also aware that I am not anywhere close to reaching the knowledge a bioinformatician has but I’d like to have a grasp on the subject at least. Thanks a lot!",

He's blamed chocolate, sugar, caffeine, hayfever and a plethra of other things that I can't list of completely since it chabges every other week. Right now, he's blaming our cat which is odd since we've had him for much longer than my dad has had the condition. The condition appears all over his body, except his head. With skin breaking out all over, becoming painful, red and itchy with the skin peeling off in clumps. It's somewhere between a Freddy Krueger and a strawberry cheese-cake with coconut shavings on top. If you couldn't tell already, my dad is very very paranoid. In recent years, he's faced a lot of hardship. Recently, he's lost a few family members and has been overall severely stressed with dealing with the estates. He's also lost a few close friends, three this year alone. He's been very paranoid about health, death and the future. My dad has trouble seeing the finer details so he ends up only seeing the bigger picture. He's like a caged chicken but somehow more nihilistic. Apart from the skin condition and his mental health, my dad is in absolute perfect health. Probably because of his paranoia he does whatevers in his comfort zone to stay fit, active and healthy. Recently, he's been helping out with an upcoming music festival. He reaslised he needed to get out the house and stop staring into oblivion all day long. So he's been out there helping the festival crew with carpentry and other doo-dahs and he's been having alot of fun with it. I could tell because he's finding it hard to come up with things to complain about. But he admitted something to me. He said that he didn't have much of a problem with his skin when he was out there doing the work. \n\nWhich made me realise something. So there's no doubt in my mind the skin issue is an autoimmune disease. Both myself and my sister suffer from them, mine being somewhat more horrendous because I have both messed up bones and messed up muscles that stiffen up like a bastard. So the condition is obviously hereditary, since neither me nor my sister share a mother. My dad is almost on the verge of this as well. But I have a hypothesis that may explain the severity of my father's condition. \n\nIs it possible for an autoimmune disease to worsen in part due to stress, anxiety or other intense emotions? Because to me, that seems to be the most fitting diagnoses for my dad. And not just this, but what would be a good way to treat this? \n\nAny help will do, thank you for taking your time to read through this.",
