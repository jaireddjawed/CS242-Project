The CRISPR gene-editing system was patented, and the Higgs boson particle was located. The COVID virus caused a global health emergency and widespread social and economic disruption. The United Kingdom left the European Union. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ended, and a war in Ukraine began. Super Bowl XLIX became the most-watched television broadcast in American history that did not involve a man walking on the Moon. The last widow of a Civil War veteran died, and - for the first time since the 15th century - a Pope retired.\n\nAnd there was (is) baseball. Professional baseball in America turned 150 years old. The \"Statcast era\" began. Mike Trout debuted, Ichiro Suzuki retired, and Henry Aaron died. The Chicago Cubs won their first World Series championship in 108 years. The designated hitter came to the National League, the \"zombie runner\" was introduced, the ball was juiced (or not, or maybe at some times but not at other times, it's still unclear). Five of the 21 perfect games in MLB history were pitched, and Aaron Judge became the fifth player in MLB history to hit more than 60 home runs in a season. Baseball was cut short by COVID in 2020, and the worst labor dispute since 1994 nearly scuttled the 2022 season.\n\nUse this thread to discuss the last thirteen years, including, but not limited to, questions such as:\n\n* Which was the best team of the decade (plus)?\n* Who was the best player of this baker's dozen years?\n* What was the most impactful event on the game to occur since 2010?\n* What is the years' most interesting \"what if\"?","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678795355.0},{"title":"Georgia General Assembly: HR 474 - Major League Baseball Hall of Fame Committee; induct former Atlanta Braves player Dale Murphy into the National Baseball Hall of Fame; urge","author":"JuniusPhilaenus","url":"https:\/\/www.legis.ga.gov\/legislation\/65266","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678808034.0},{"title":"Chavez Young clears the defense to score 2 runs tying the game against Colombia","author":"AlexanderWun","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/t1xxws7vmkna1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678741550.0},{"title":"[Highlight] Joey Meneses hits his second home run of the game against USA.","author":"handlit33","url":"https:\/\/streamable.com\/tnyez5","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678678901.0},{"title":"[Yankees] Statement on the passing of Joe Pepitone","author":"Kogie13","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Yankees\/status\/1635390784286629888?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678743307.0},{"title":"What is the best team ever to have 0 Hall of Famers (or anyone likely to get elected in the future)?","author":"jorleeduf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/baseball\/comments\/11qupxx\/what_is_the_best_team_ever_to_have_0_hall_of\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678762800.0},{"title":"Bo Bichette launches a 453 ft moonshot for his second HR of the game","author":"bichettes_helmet","url":"https:\/\/mlb-cuts-diamond.mlb.com\/FORGE\/2023\/2023-03\/13\/41b0642f-94bbf4d3-0634ba45-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_4000K.mp4","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678733570.0},{"title":"TIL - in 2019 (I did not look at other years) Nippon Professional Baseball (Top Japanese League) had a higher average attendance than the MLB.","author":"jimboknows6916","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_attendance_figures_at_domestic_professional_sports_leagues","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678731997.0},{"title":"[Carrabis] The video of Shohei Ohtani hitting a home run for Japan in the World Baseball Classic this morning has 6 million views on Fox\u2019s MLB account in about 10 hours.

It's precisely because cricket's the most popular sport is why India should be a prime target for the MLB. It's a country with over a billion people that knows and plays a ball and stick game. Yes, baseball and cricket are different but at the fundamental level they are similar. The MLB should be drooling at the amount of people playing a game where one player throws a ball at another player trying to hit it with a stick, it's not as hard to explain a cricket player the rules of baseball as to a football player explaining how football works to a soccer player.\n\nAnother reason as to why the argument I quoted above is dumb is because there's no need for baseball to surpass cricket. America has four major sports leagues, and the MLB is arguable at third place, and it seems to be doing just fine. So being second place in a country of over a billion people where there's a lack of another sport rivaling cricket at the top should be ringing bells all the time at Manfred's brain.\n\nBut yeah, finally the positives are fairly self-evident. I've looked at the demographics and at minimum there are 186 million children that could start learning baseball tomorrow. Plus add 121 million teens and young adults and that's 300 million people. Remember, these people are familiar at playing a ball and stick game so it's much easier to make them learn baseball compared to other countries and people in general. The MLB should definitely push hard to promote baseball in India.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678712989.0},{"title":"[San Diego Padres] Tatis has been scratched from today\u2019s lineup due to left knee contusion.","author":"suzie17","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/padres\/status\/1635010446083371008?s=46&t=sFefipaB8MKxNOAzWCCu-w","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678652311.0},{"title":"Bryce Harper Reveals His Intense MLB Workout Routine - 2023 Training","author":"racketpro","url":"https:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=3QHEyypAlrM&feature=share","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.65,"created_utc":1678717290.0},{"title":"[Highlight] Salvador Perez's no-doubter gives Venezuela the 7-0 lead.","author":"handlit33","url":"https:\/\/streamable.com\/7wr9fl","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678664683.0},{"title":"Knucks\u2019s?","author":"oifvetxcheese","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/y6ps5ic7igna1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678673514.0},{"title":"Bobby Witt Jr RBI-Double lowers the deficit to 8","author":"AlexanderWun","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/6mivdn7vyfna1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678685056.0},{"title":"Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos\u2019 final line vs. Venezuela (1.0 IP, 5 H, 6 R, 5 ER, 2 BB, 1 K)","author":"Terrible-Ideal-7342","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/baseball\/comments\/11ptvm7\/jos\u00e9_berr\u00edos_final_line_vs_venezuela_10_ip_5_h_6\/","text":"PR is down 7-0 to Venezuela.

The team is noticeably better than last season, yet the fun has gotten sapped out of it for me. This feels like being in a relationship in which you're showing more affection to your partner than vice-versa, and you're watching your partner flirt with another person.\n\nWhile I know that the A's have spent millions on the Howard Terminal project, they've also spent millions in Vegas as part of their so-called \"parallel path\", and have been quiet about HT for months. I strongly believe that if they truly want to stay here--and if they're as \"Rooted in Oakland\" as their slogan says, they ought to help us with the off-site shortfall. They (and Rob Manfred) know full-well that Oakland leaders have worked relentlessly to secure state and federal grants, and do all they can without dipping into the city's general fund and dragging us further into financial debt. FWIW, Joe Lacob even said himself that he would pay for it all if he owned the A's, which is sad to know that this could be solved quickly with just an ownership change. John Fisher is too cheap to help pay the remaining costs, and too greedy to sell the team.\n\nWhile this isn't over yet and while Nevada's elected leaders still seem tepid about providing the A's with public money after the Raiders deal--and even though the A's haven't decided on one Vegas site yet, the possibility of us losing yet another team is not only stressful, but downright embarrassing. If that were to happen, most non-Oaklanders and sports pundits wouldn't view it as ownership taking advantage of us and not really wanting to be here. Instead, they'd place all of the blame on us and our elected leaders. I can't tell you how many people I've heard accuse us of not really caring about the A's, for example, or accusing our leaders of actually trying to force our teams out--which is an idiotic take. Oakland and other East Bay fans are just as good as fans in any other part of the country, yet we've had multiple teams ripped from us over the last 5 years, and our last remaining professional team is in jeopardy.\n\nNevertheless, sometimes I question why I'm an A's fan. My dad and my older brothers got me into following the team, but I wasn't born yet when they last won a WS title. All I've ever known is this organization trading away fan favorites while feigning being poor (John Fisher is also cheap with the San Jose Earthquakes BTW, despite a new stadium), and making relocation threats every year. \n\nI can't express enough how jealous I am of other fans and cities that never have to experience this with their teams.\n\nRANT OVER.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678674268.0},{"title":"Starling Marte exited the game today after a HBP to the helmet","author":"jl_23","url":"https:\/\/mlb-cuts-diamond.mlb.com\/FORGE\/2023\/2023-03\/12\/fa659041-4e2e3cc7-1d14d139-csvm-diamondx64-asset_1280x720_59_16000K.mp4","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678653669.0},{"title":"Luis Garcia rocking patriotic hair beads in Venezuelan colors","author":"KamartyMcFlyweight","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/iygebhxmw7na1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678587439.0},{"title":"Who\u2019s the most overrated \u201che\u2019s so underrated\u201d player of the past decade?","author":"JoeyBougie","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/baseball\/comments\/11q0mq5\/whos_the_most_overrated_hes_so_underrated_player\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1678683630.0},{"title":"Win probablility of Israel vs Nicaragua, per @SlangsOnSports","author":"RavenclawNatsfan","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/c0d41tjhnena1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678651072.0},{"title":"[Highlight] Mike Trout steals a base for America.","author":"handlit33","url":"https:\/\/streamable.com\/o312ir","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678591822.0},{"title":"Czech electrician strikes out Ohtani, earns bragging rights for life","author":"miner88","url":"https:\/\/www.mlb.com\/news\/shohei-ohtani-strikes-out-against-electrician-in-world-baseball-classic?partnerID=mlbapp-iOS_article-share","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678589860.0},{"title":"[General Discussion] Around the Horn - 3\/13\/23","author":"BaseballBot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/baseball\/comments\/11q43ax\/general_discussion_around_the_horn_31323\/","text":"# So what's this thread for?\n\n * Discussion of yesterday's games\n * Excitement for today's games\n * General questions\n * Mildly interesting facts\n * Praising Santa \ud83c\udf85\n * Anything else worth sharing\/asking that doesn't warrant its own post\n\nFor game threads, use the games schedule on the sidebar to navigate to the team you want a game thread for.\n\n#Featured posts and links\n\n* [Join the official \/r\/baseball Discord server!](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/baseball\/comments\/8o2bxp\/the_official_rbaseball_discord_server)\n* ~~Be sure to place your entry in today's [**Nightly Pick 'Em**](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfxxWbgpCCGD2bP2VJw0-NAcaKfwN3D_803m7sy_p1jQ5mZag\/viewform) by \/u\/Mazzocchi~~ Closed until next season\n* Check out:\n  * This week's ~~[States of the Baseball Subreddits](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/baseball\/comments\/yorl1n\/state_of_the_baseball_subreddits_20221107\/)~~ Completed until the 2023 Season\n  * This week's ~~MLB Graphical Standing Series~~ Completed until the 2023 Season\n* New to \/r\/baseball and baseball?

While it's likely to be decided by the result of tonight's Czech \/ Aus game, there's some potential run differential shenanigans that I think are fun to play out.\n\n- Korea beats China, Australia loses but scores at least four runs - Korea advances\n\nIn this scenario, both Australia and the Czech Republic would have given up more runs (or the same amount of runs in fewer innings) to the other tied teams than Korea has.\n\nThere's also some neat super weird situations here - there's a world where the Czech Republic is about to mercy rule Australia and needs to let off the gas so the game continues. Since the tiebreaker is runs allowed divided by outs made in games with the tied teams, a game getting cut short could harm the winning team's tiebreaker standing.\n\n- China beats Korea, Australia scores more than 18 runs but loses by one in a walk off with two outs - Australia advances\n\nThis one's a super stretch but I still think it's conceptually interesting that something like this could happen.\n\nSince Australia recorded three more outs against Korea, they have a slight lead in the runs allowed tiebreaker. While most wins by the Czech Republic would offset this, a very high scoring one run game where Australia gets a couple extra outs before being walked off would leave Australia just barely ahead.\n\nWhile everything outside the 5-4 win that gives Korea a chance to advance is super unlikely, I'm always fascinated by any time a team may be incentivised to not play the game as well as they can because of some obscure rule or process and wanted to share!\n\nI've tried to find scenarios where we get an exact tie, but didn't have much luck. Anything's possible with these wacky rules though, if we go into extras that Czech team's accountants and engineers might need to break out some spreadsheets.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678660034.0},{"title":"Ryoji Kuribayashi will be unavailable for Japan's quarterfinal matchup against Italy due to lower back tightness.

As of right now, that doesn't change anything, but when you read \"if they win in a blowout,\" just substitute in \"if they don't give up any runs.\"\n\nFor those who don't know, there's five teams in a pod, and the top 2 get to move on to the next round, the next three are eliminated. If you're in 3rd or 4th, that's it for you, try again next time. If you finish 5th, however, you do not automatically get entered into the next WBC, you have to go back to qualifiers and have to win your way back in. Now, a team of Cuba's stature would likely win their qualifiers, especially if it's the same process as last years, but then again, baseball happens. Spain was supposed to crush their qualies too, yet they're not here, they got beat by Czech dudes with day jobs.\n\nThere's three games left in the pod:\n\n**Netherlands vs Taiwan**\n\n**Cuba vs Taiwan**\n\n**Netherlands vs Italy**\n\nIf one assumes a Netherlands victory against Taiwan (which isn't a given, anything can happen in one baseball game, but it's pretty likely), that would ensure a Netherlands 1st place, and if I'm understanding the tiebreakers correctly, then everything except for Panama finishing in last can happen.\n\n> **Cuba win, Netherlands win**: Cuba tied at 2-2 with Panama, **Cuba advances** on head-to-head, Italy and Taiwan tie at 1-3, **Italy is relegated** on head-to-head.\n> \n> **Taiwan win, Netherlands win**: Taiwan and Panama tied at 2-2, **Panama advances** on head-to-head, Italy and Cuba tie at 1-3, **Cuba is relegated** on head-to-head.\n> \n> **Cuba win, Italy win**: Cuba tied at 2-2 with Panama and Italy, all three teams would be 1-1 in head-to-head, so we move to run differential, of which Cuba is currently +2, Panama is +\/- 0, and Italy is -3. It'd be a *very likely* **Cuban advance** since Italy would need to beat the best team in the pool by no less than 6 more runs than Cuba beats Taiwan. At 1-3, **Taiwan is relegated**\n> \n> **Taiwan win, Italy win**: Taiwan tied at 2-2 with Italy and Panama, all 1-1 in head to head, run differential has Taiwan at -3, and in this scenario they'd be at -4. This is truly the most up in the air scenario, as two close wins means Panama advances, a blowout win by other side means they advance. At 1-3, **Cuba is relegated**\n\nOf course, this all assumes a Netherlands victory against Taiwan. If Taiwan wins, then this all gets thrown into chaos, and I think basically any result can happen except for Netherlands, Panama or Taiwan getting relegated. Literally anyone can advance if this happens, if I'm not mistaken. It was considered the most balanced Pool in the tournament going in, and it's going to be a very hectic last few games.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678519027.0},{"title":"Ohtani controlling Kondo","author":"Lucksury","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/rlwj4k14czma1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678483678.0},{"title":"Your World Baseball Classic tv schedule for Saturday.

Eddie Murray flew out to left field, then Joe Orsulak stepped up to the plate. On an 0-2 count, Kile threw a curveball that appeared to hit Orsulak's foot, but the home plate umpire never indicated that it did. As McKnight advanced to second base, catcher Scott Servais did not immediately grab the ball, and McKnight took the opportunity to go for third. First baseman Jeff Bagwell got the ball and threw to third, but the throw was off-target and McKnight scored. The umpires reviewed the ball and found no shoe polish, which led them to rule that it did not hit Orsulak. The play was scored a wild pitch and an E3. The perfect game was gone, and the shutout was now gone, but the Astros still had a 3-1 lead. Kile retired Orsulak on a fly ball to left field, then retired the next 15 Mets he faced to seal his no-hitter. He threw only 83 pitches.

Edit: What I mean by this is, both teams could have won OR lost the Series depending on the result of the plate appearance. So all of these had to be in Game 7s (or Game 8, in the 1912 case). \n\nLet's see what happened in each one, in reverse-chronological order:\n\n2016 \u2013 Michael Martinez\n\nCubs at Indians, Game 7, bottom of the 10th, down by 1, runner on 1st, 2 outs.\n\nThis all-time classic didn\u2019t seem like it should come down to Michael Martinez, a late-inning defensive replacement whose defense wasn\u2019t even tested in the game, but that\u2019s how baseball works sometimes. The previous batter, Rajai Davis, had tied the game earlier with a clutch 2-run home run in the 8th inning, and remarkably he could have achieved the same result in the 10th. Instead, he merely hit an RBI single up the middle, bringing Cleveland to within 1 run and sending Martinez, a career .197 hitter, to the plate. He had been the last player on the bench when Terry Francona sent him out to replace weak-armed Coco Crisp in the 9th inning, so Francona was handcuffed here. Martinez hit a slow roller to Kris Bryant, who threw across the diamond to give the Cubs their first championship in 108 years.\n\nWinner: PITCHER\n\n2014 \u2013 Salvador Perez\n\nGiants at Royals, Game 7, bottom of the 9th, down by 1, runner on 3rd, 2 outs.\n\nThe Royals may seem like a laughingstock now, and they were before the mid-2010s too, but for a couple of seasons they were a dominant pesky force to be reckoned with. The Giants, meanwhile, were thriving from EYBS and had apparently found the arm of God and attached it to Madison Bumgarner\u2019s body. Alex Gordon came oh-so-close to tying the game with a misplayed single into left-center that allowed him to reach 3rd base. Knowing how dominant Bumgarner had been, the decision to keep Gordon at 3rd is one of the biggest what-ifs of our lifetimes. Instead, the Royals\u2019 hopes came down to Salvador Perez, who could\u2019ve won the game with a home run but instead popped out to Pablo Sandoval to end the Series. The Royals won the Series the following season, though, so it\u2019s all good.\n\nWinner: PITCHER\n\n2001 \u2013 Jay Bell, Tony Womack\n\nYankees at Diamondbacks, Game 7, bottom of the 9th, down by 1, runners on 1st and 2nd, 0 outs.\n\nThe Yankees had won the World Series in every year that the Diamondbacks existed when the two teams met up in 2001. This was a Series for the ages, with elite pitching and clutch hitting on both sides. Jay Bell\u2019s plate appearance is perhaps the biggest \u201ctechnicality\u201d on this list, as it would have taken a triple play for the Yankees to win, or an extra-base hit for the D-backs to win. Both were extremely unlikely, since Bell dropped down a bunt. Mariano Rivera fielded the bunt and got a force-out at 3rd. Tony Womack then came up with his own Series-deciding plate appearance and won the hearts of all non-Yankee fans by tying the game with a double down the RF line. Luis Gonzalez then won the Series a couple of batters later with a floater to center field.\n\nWinner: PITCHER, BATTER\n\n1997 \u2013 Charles Johnson, Craig Counsell\n\nIndians at Marlins, Game 7, bottom of the 9th, down by 1, runner on 1st, 1 out.\n\nThis was an incredible game that doesn\u2019t get talked about as much as it should, likely because of the small-market teams involved. In the bottom of the 9th, Cleveland was within striking distance of its first World Series victory since 1948. With their backs against the wall, the Marlins rallied and tied the game with a single by Charles Johnson and a sacrifice fly by Craig Counsell (current Brewers manager). Later on, 21-year old Edgar Renteria hit a walkoff single to win the Marlins\u2019 first World Series championship just 5 years into their existence.\n\nWinner: BATTER, BATTER\n\n1972 \u2013 Pete Rose\n\nAthletics at Reds, Game 7, bottom of the 9th, down by 1, runner on 1st, 2 outs.\n\nIn one of the closest World Series matchups of all-time (6 out of 7 games decided by 1 run), the A\u2019s narrowly came out on top. With two outs in the 9th and nobody on, bullpen superhero Rollie Fingers hit pinch-hitter Darrel Chaney with a pitch to bring the winning run up to the plate. And this hitter was somebody you could bet on: the eventual record-holder for career hits, Pete Rose. Though he made solid contact and drove the ball into the left-center gap, it stayed in the air long enough for the LF to make the catch, clinching the first Series victory for the A\u2019s since they had left Philadelphia.\n\nWinner: PITCHER\n\n1962 \u2013 Chuck Hiller, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey\n\nYankees at Giants, Game 7, bottom of the 9th, down by 1, runner on 1st, 1 out.\n\nThis is the only time 3 batters in one World Series had an opportunity to win or lose it. On the mound was Ralph Terry, the pitcher who had given up Bill Mazeroski\u2019s Series-winning home run two years earlier (which isn\u2019t on this list because the game was tied). This time, Terry was successful, though only by the skin of his teeth. After getting Hiller to strike out, Willie Mays hit a double to RF to put the Series-winning run in scoring position. Willie McCovey then hit what he claimed was \u201cthe hardest ball I ever hit,\u201d but it was straight at the second baseman, who caught it to secure the series.\n\nWinner: PITCHER, BATTER, PITCHER\n\n1926 \u2013 Bob Meusel\n\nCardinals at Yankees, Game 7, bottom of the 9th, down by 1, runner on 1st, 2 outs.\n\nBob Meusel led the AL in home runs and RBI the previous season, but he had a down year in \u201826. Unfortunately, despite being put in a position to decide that year\u2019s World Series for himself, the opportunity was taken away from him. Known speedster Babe Ruth, the runner on 1st, attempted to steal second base and was promptly thrown out to end the Series. Ruth actually had 11 stolen bases that year and 123 in his career, but his success rate was pretty much 50\/50, so his decision to try to steal with everything on the line was suspect at best. Given his fame (and the fact that the Yankees won the Series the following two seasons), Ruth was likely forgiven, but God, can you imagine how fans would react to something like this today?\n\nWinner: PITCHER (& catcher?)\n\n1912 \u2013 Steve Yerkes, Tris Speaker\n\nGiants at Red Sox, Game 8 (a previous game had been called a tie due to darkness and respect for future spring training rules), bottom of the 10th, down by 1, runner on 2nd, 1 out.\n\nLight-hitting middle infielder Steve Yerkes had the first plate appearance in World Series history that could have won or lost the series. It would\u2019ve taken something like a line-drive double play to lose, or a home run to win (of which he had 0 in 131 games that year), but they were both theoretically possible. Instead, he walked.\n\nHall-of-Famer Tris Speaker then came up with slightly higher chances of winning or losing: a ground ball would\u2019ve done the trick for the Giants, or a double in the gap would\u2019ve been enough for the Red Sox. He almost popped out, but miscommunication between the C, 1B, and P allowed the ball to drop foul. With another chance, he hit a single to tie the game.\n\nA couple of batters later, Larry Gardner hit the only sacrifice fly to ever end a World Series.\n\nWinner: BATTER, BATTER\n\nTOTALS: 7 \u201csuccesses\u201d for the pitcher and 6 \u201csuccesses\u201d for the batter, though success does not necessarily mean the game was won or lost with these plate appearances.\n\nTL;DR: in reverse-chronological order, ground out, pop out, double, fielder's choice, sacrifice fly, single, fly out, line out, double, strikeout, caught stealing, single, walk.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678292594.0},{"title":"Best Player on each WBC team according to MLB.

This refers to a 1954 film adaptation of the musical *Brigadoon*, which tells the story of a mysterious Scottish village that appears for a single day, then disappears for a hundred years before being seen again. Bouton felt the Pilots' short existence gave them a similar timeless, ephemeral mystique.\n\nI was curious how many \"Brigadoon Matchups\" have occurred throughout MLB history - that is, how many seasons have seen a meeting of two iterations of teams that have never met before and can never meet again. Of course, the 1969 season saw every American League squad versus the Pilots, so that's a season's worth right there. Without travelling too far into the past, when team names were much more fluid, here's the few others I found:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* 1954 - Philadelphia Athletics vs. Baltimore Orioles\n\n\n\nin 1953 and before, the matchup was the Philly A's versus the St. Louis Browns; in 1955, it became the Kansas City Athletics versus the Baltimore Orioles.\n\n\n\n\n* 1965 - Milwaukee Braves vs. Houston Astros\n\n\n\nfrom 1962-1964, the Milwaukee Braves faced the Houston Colt .45's; starting in 1966, the Astros would face the Atlanta Braves.\n\n\n\n\n* 2001 - Montr\u00e9al Expos vs. Cleveland Indians\n* 2003 - Montr\u00e9al Expos vs. Oakland Athletics\n* 2003 - Montr\u00e9al Expos vs. Texas Rangers\n* 2003 - Montr\u00e9al Expos vs. Anaheim Angels\n* 2004 - Montr\u00e9al Expos vs. Minnesota Twins\n\n\n\neach of these interleague matchups only happened once before the Expos became the Washington Nationals\n\n\n\n\n* 2002 - Anaheim Angels vs. St. Louis Cardinals\n* 2002 - Anaheim Angels vs. Cincinnati Reds\n* 2003 - Anaheim Angels vs. New York Mets\n* 2003 - Anaheim Angels vs. Philadelphia Phillies\n* 2003 - Anaheim Angels vs. Florida Marlins\n* 2004 - Anaheim Angels vs. Chicago Cubs\n* 2004 - Anaheim Angels vs. Houston Astros\n\n\n\nnow we're cheating a bit. the change from \"Anaheim\" to \"Los Angeles of Anaheim\" is not nearly as significant as moving cities or completely rebranding the team identity, but it seemed worth acknowledging. these were the only interleague matchups the Angels had against these teams with the \"Anaheim\" moniker. (the Expos also belong on this list.)\n\n\n\n\n* 2003 - Tampa Bay Devil Rays vs. Houston Astros\n* 2003 - Tampa Bay Devil Rays vs. Chicago Cubs\n* 2005 - Tampa Bay Devil Rays vs. Milwaukee Brewers\n* 2005 - Tampa Bay Devil Rays vs. Cincinnati Reds\n\n\n\nhere's another sort of cheap entry to the list. the fact remains, though, that the next time Tampa Bay faced any of these teams in interleague play, they had become simply the Rays.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is entirely possible, if not probable, that I missed a matchup or a few.

He would technically be a batter who reached base safely, but it seems counterintuitive to allow this to end a perfect game this way since a fielder's choice should not be possible when a pitcher or team has yet to allow a batter to reach, especially if the Manfred Man is successfully put out.\n\nEdit: For those in the comments, MLB and Elias Sport Bureau have already clarified that the Manfred Man himself, does not break up a perfect game since he was never a batter who reached safely, my question is specifically as to whether a Fielder\u2019s Choice would end the perfect game. \n\nOn one hand it seems it would since the batter safely reaches first, but on the other hand that seems unfair as he only reached because the fielder chose to make a play on the lead runner, who does not count against the perfect game. If they fail to record the out it likely makes sense that it would end the perfect game, but if the lead runner is successfully cut down then the only reason the batter reached was because the defense opted to attempt, and successfully made, a play on the lead runner.

I'm also a fan of the Dodgers due to living in SoCal for a few years. And now? I live in Brewers country. \n\nDo you guys have teams you root for, but don't consider yourself a fan of?

So I took to MLB The Show and got to simulating (as the Yankees, of course) - before every series, I would save, sim, and if I didn't sweep my opponent, it was reload time to try again (I'll have some metadata towards the end of the post).

Using the formula for Pythagorean wins, this team would expect to finish 134-28, still far beyond the regular season records of 117 wins.\n  \n&nbsp;\n\nSome metadata stuff:\nThis took about 3 hours to sim through a whole season, but I could have probably done it in less than 2 if I was really trying. I occasionally stopped to look at stats and stuff.\n  \n&nbsp;\n\nHere is a list of how many simulations it took to get through each series. As you can see, generally the further I got through the season the less sims I needed. I think this is probably because I had a lot of players who were 'hot', and I think that might affect how things work in sims.

I couldn't find anything, so I decided to make my own ranking!\n\nThis kind of thing is obviously very subjective. My comments mostly come from a design-execution standpoint, but I'd be curious to hear other's thoughts on the looks, with some teams seemingly doing the bare minimum and others with well-established branding. The rankings are mostly based on the logo being used, but the overall aesthetic of the hat and its wearability is also taken into account.\n\n[Gallery version](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/vzNoDXG)\n\n**20.** [**Italy**](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pf5MemJ.jpg) \u2013 I love simplicity. This takes that to the extreme though, with a basic block I, which is also the letter that takes up the least amount of space in the alphabet so the whole hat just ends up looking really empty. The script on their jersey is even worse. For non-baseball fans, this hat would stand for \"I...am more bored looking at this than watching baseball.\"\n\n**19. [Venezuela](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dB8gCUt.jpg)** \u2013 I'm pretty sure they picked a script font that comes pre-installed in every computer, typed V, and called it a day. Maroon and gold happens to be my favorite color combo in sports, so this is a shame, but I'm just really not a fan of this \"checkmark.\" It's also a personal preference, but I hate double outlines.\n\n**18. [Nicaragua](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7OqXE5D.png)** \u2013 Italy 2.0, but this one at least fills the space better and I like the slightly vertically stretched N. It's a bit bland and boring, very generic, but maybe that also makes it bold.\n\n**17. [Chinese Taipei](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jtcedaI.jpg)** \\- The more I look at it, the more I hate this logo. The T is just plain weird with how short the left of the top bar is. It overlaps into the stitching on the ball ever so slightly, making it look accidental. The inverted strokes on the C and T are...interesting. I wanted to rank it last, but decided a strikeout swinging is better than one looking. At least they didn't just take a letter and slap it on the hat without thought.\n\n**16. [Great Britain](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nl4N61E.jpg)** \u2013 Another candidate for last, this looks like it belongs in an airport at Heathrow. All the heraldic history of the nation and you choose...an italicized sans serif. What helps save it is the bar on the G lines up perfectly with the top of the B, so at least it's not totally slapped together.\n\n**15. [Panama](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6RujbHo.jpg)** \u2013 The bottom of this list could really be interchangeable, they're all bottom tier boring. Again, I don't like double outlines. A very generic block typeface. What saves the hat overall is we've got our only tri-color hat in the tournament with the white front panel, nicely matching the look of the flag.\n\n**14. [Puerto Rico](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2vgiLsI.jpg)** \u2013 I'm definitely more of a traditionalist with my caps and typefaces, but I can appreciate a more modern, slanted serif. I don't like how the P is just placed on top of the R with no interaction though, and it ends up looking more like a generic Regional logo in the Little League World Series.\n\n**13. [USA](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/XDDYrlR.jpg)** \u2013 I've long hated the USA's baseball look. It's just too busy! You've got beveling in the letters, an outline, and a star behind them that gets lost. It is well designed though, with nice interlocking and the serifs following the same angles as the skewed star (like the top of the U, bottom of the S).\n\n**12. [Colombia](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dpy6MWV.jpg)** \u2013 I love a tuscan typeface as much as the next baseball fan. This one is chunky and almost reads as an E, which in my book makes it even cooler.\n\n**11. [Cuba](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/IOvFju8.jpg)** \u2013 The first of several swooshing letters in this list. It's nice, it does the job, but nothing that's very memorable. I think what's throwing me off is the lack of balance, it's very bottom-heavy.\n\n**10. [Japan](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/g85Ljan.jpg)** \u2013 This is hard for me because I actually really like Japan's look as a whole. But I'm just looking at caps and logos here. And while I prefer Colombia's use of the Tuscan letter, the little additions to the cap give Japan the edge, with the red stitching and gold underbill. Not a fan of the graphite though.\n\n**9. [Korea](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/S02kw9S.jpg)** \u2013 I feel like this one's placement in the rankings could vary wildly depending on the person. But here I am putting it right in the middle. It's definitely reliant on the embroidering for dimension, and I couldn't find what the significance of the \"ribbon\" look is, so if anyone can enlighten me I'd love to know if there's more of a backstory.\n\n**8. [Czech Republic](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pT4ZlVL.jpg)** \u2013 Okay now we're getting into the meat of the order, where each of the remaining hats is solid. Love the subtle baseball imagery with the monogram in the shape of home plate, and I \\*think\\* that's supposed to just be a ball? It's weird, it's a random circle in the bottom, and I love it.\n\n**7. [Canada](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/56NtcAk.jpg)** \u2013 Canada does a great job of keeping a consistent look across all their sports teams. The swooshing letter works better than most, with the entire ball trail making up the C. It also fits really well into the maple leaf, with the end of the tail lining up perfectly with the right side of the leaf. I have some minor quibbles, some stroke width inconsistencies and how small the baseball stitching is.\n\n**6. [Israel](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NXGxSvT.jpg)** \u2013 The double-stroke inline version of the Star is really nice and well done, and I'm sure it looks great close up to see the embroidery and dimension. Just a super clean hat that reminds me a bit of my team, the Blue Jays. Can't help but wonder how it'd look with a white front panel and blue star though.\n\n**5. [Netherlands](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rKTNtU1.jpg)** \u2013 The oranje get it right again, it's hard to mess up that beautiful black and orange look. They get massive points for, along with Israel, being the only teams to not feature a monogram. They could've easily slapped a block N on it and called it a day. The crown itself is very well designed, and who wouldn't want to wear a crown on their crown. This is also one of the only instances where I like the giant flag on the side, for that pop of color.\n\n**4. [Mexico](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zNqK1e7.jpg)** \u2013 Like Canada, Mexico does a fantastic job of keeping a consistent brand look throughout their teams. The pseudo-lowercase M with a green inline is beautiful and looks just perfectly balanced in the center of a ball cap. And since I love chunky design, that thick red outline is what every team should be doing.\n\n**3. [Dominican Republic](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/LNsE24x.jpg)** \u2013 Nothing bad to say about the execution of this monogram, it's perfect. I love the slightly elongated letters. The interlocking slab-serif letters are a timeless baseball look that befits an international powerhouse, and one of only a few teams in the tourney that opted for a different colored bill.\n\n**2. [Australia](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/srcnBw0.jpg)** \u2013 The nod to the flag with the Southern Cross and 7-pointed star helping to make the crossbar in the A are sublime. The Oakland A's have my favorite look in baseball so I'm a bit biased, and kind of wish the A and star trail were yellow (like this [alternate version](https:\/\/content.sportslogos.net\/logos\/67\/1827\/full\/7436.gif)) Interestingly, a lot of these logos look awful in their flat .png versions, as I would have a lot of nitpicking to do on the inconsistencies in their design, but those mostly go away once embroidered and cleaned up.\n\n**1. [China](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/PmtyEUj.jpg)** \u2013 To me, this is everything a baseball hat that represents an entire country should be: a simple yet iconic monogram that draws from the nation's unique imagery. Despite being a top-heavy logo with the big dragon head, it's actually quite well-balanced and could've easily been messed up. The bright yellow on red is super striking, and they didn't muddy it up with embellishments or extra outlines. And if you've read any fantasy fiction, you know dragons always win.\n\nDon't worry y'all, offseason is almost over!","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678214655.0},{"title":"How accurate are pre season projections for team records and playoff odds","author":"MONGSTRADAMUS","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/baseball\/comments\/11mg9xn\/how_accurate_are_pre_season_projections_for_team\/","text":"Since we are getting a bit closer to the start of the season , I have been looking at PECOTA, Fangraphs, and Clay davenport projections for teams and records.

These are pretty rough estimates and could fluctuate a bit, but are good guidelines for discussion around ties.

A terrorist attack on the United States led to US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The last Betamax player was produced. The human genome was mapped, and Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube were founded. The iPod, iPhone, and Roomba were first marketed, and the first consumer hard drive to hold one terabyte of data was sold. The NASA rovers \"Spirit\" and \"Opportunity\" landed on Mars, beginning their 14-year exploration of the planet. *Avatar* became the highest-grossing film in history, Cormac McCarthy wrote *The Road* and *No Country for Old Men,* and the American band Hoobastank released their most successful single, \"The Reason.\" The pop of the housing bubble triggered the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression, and the US Congress authorized a $700 billion bailout for troubled banks that were \"too big to fail.\"\n\nAnd there was baseball. Julio Rodr\u00edguez was born, Albert Pujols debuted, Barry Bonds retired, and Ted Williams died (and was cryogenically frozen). *Moneyball* and advanced analytics revolutionized baseball management. A 400-page bombshell report by former US Senator George J. Mitchell on the use of steroids in baseball was published. In 2006, the Committee on African-American Baseball elected 17 people from the history of Black baseball to the Hall of Fame, including Effa Manley, the Hall's first woman inductee. The 2001 Mariners tied the 1906 Cubs' MLB-best mark of 116 wins, and the 2003 Tigers tied the 1962 Mets' MLB-best (worst?) mark of 119 losses.\n\nAnd most importantly for baseball, the human race, and the cosmos, r\/baseball was created.

Seeing a few of the names here reminded me of all the baseball players with generic ass-names that I've seen or heard of over the years, and I wondered if I could field a full 26 man roster made up of current and former players who would have had prominent settler roles. As it turns out, you definitely can field a Major League caliber roster.\n\n**Importance**\n\nN\/A\n\n**Method**\n\nAfter doing a quick search for some occupational surnames, I tried to compile a roster that balanced on-field talent and in-the-fields productivity. The goal is to try to have a winning season, and also create a habitable environment where hopefully the team won't freeze or starve to death. Since a surname is what gives indication of the descendant's occupation, I only considered the last names of candidates and not first names, so sorry but you won't find [Tanner Roark](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/tanner) on here, and all our animal hides will be pasty, like me. As this roster reflects a time period that exists before true civilization, the starting lineup does not include a designated hitter. Without further ado, I present to you, your Homestead Settlers:\n\n|Player|Baseball Role|Homestead Role|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Will Smith|C|[Metal worker](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/smith)|\n|Reggie Smith|1B|Metal worker|\n|David Fletcher|2B|[Arrow maker](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/fletcher)|\n|Justin Turner|3B|[Furniture maker](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/turner)|\n|Ozzie Smith|SS|Metal worker|\n|Bryce Harper|LF|[Musician](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/harper)|\n|Torii Hunter|CF|[Game hunter](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/hunter)|\n|Aaron Judge|RF|[Arbiter](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/judge)|\n|Matt Carpenter|IF\/OF|[Woodworker](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/carpenter)|\n|Trea Turner|IF|Furniture maker|\n|Lonnie Smith|OF|Metal worker|\n|Dexter Fowler|OF|[Bird hunter](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/fowler)|\n|Brett Gardner|OF|[Herb gardner](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/gardener)|\n|Catfish Hunter|SP|Catfish hunter|\n|Chris Carpenter|SP|Woodworker|\n|Zack Wheeler|SP|[Wheel maker](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/wheeler)|\n|Jered Weaver|SP|[Seamster](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/weaver)|\n|Chris Archer|SP|[Archer](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/archer)|\n|Aaron Cook|LR|[Cook](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/cook)|\n|Buck Farmer|MR|[Farmer](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/farmer)|\n|Matt Shoemaker|MR|[Cobbler](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/shoemaker)|\n|Eddie Fisher|MR|[Fisherman](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/fisher)|\n|Joe Smith|MR|Metal worker|\n|Andrew Miller|SU|[Mill operator](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/miller)|\n|Will Smith|SU|Metal worker|\n|Lee Smith|CP|Metal worker|\n|Bernie Brewer|Mascot|[Beermaker](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/brewer)|\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nHoly shit there's a lot of smiths. I almost forgot about a lot Smiths because I started this exercise trying  with active or recently retired players, but eventually felt the need to expand outwards, and initially forgot to include The Smiths in my expansion. I had like, Derek Fisher and Kyle Farmer on the bench, and Tommy Hunter in the bullpen. It was ugly. But a little extra smithing never hurt anyone, right? Of course, there isn't really anyone to gather those precious ores unless I include someone like, [Zach Miner](https:\/\/www.baseball-reference.com\/players\/m\/minerza01.shtml), but I think a subset of Smiths can manage to figure out how to work the mines.\n\nThe team is pretty well rounded overall, both on the diamond and the riverside. While a backup catcher would definitely be nice, I couldn't think of one that wasn't the aforementioned Kyle Farmer, which would be a stretch that isn't worth a whole lot. Besides that, we're able to fill out a competent starting lineup, as well as a good starting rotation and decent enough bullpen.\n\nAs for the homestead life, we already know about all the smiths, but I think we've managed to hit most of our needs. Ok, it would be nice to have a [mason](https:\/\/www.dictionary.com\/browse\/mason) for shelter, but I think between the carpenters and turners, we can make log cabins fit for a loveable NY first baseman with lingering lower body issues. The weaver and shoemaker will help ensure that we have clothing to weather the brutal winters. Between our hunters, fowler, and fisher, with assistance from our archer, we should be able to gather enough meat. What we can't hunt, we can grow, thanks to our farmer, and make use of thanks to the miller. The cook should be able make enough meals out of all this to keep camp fed. Our gardener can help provide medicinal herbs, and maybe he's enough of a doctor to know how to use them? Our fletcher should also be able to keep our archer armed, who can help with defense. And of course, we have a judge to help settle any camp disputes, and a harper to keep everyone entertained.\n\nOverall, I think this team can out-hit, out-pitch, and out-last the Cincinnati Reds, so I think we did a good enough job here.\n\n**FAQs**\n\n>How much time did you spend on this research?\n\nThe perfect imbalance between too much and not enough.\n\n>Why did you do this now, the offseason is almost over and professional baseball is ramping up?\n\nIf I could have good ideas at good times, I probably wouldn't be stuck shitposting on a baseball subreddit in my free time.\n\n>Why does every player have an Anglo surname? You could probably have included even better players if you took surnames from other cultures! Are you just unapologetically racist?\n\nYes.\n\n>Why didn't you include <my favorite player> but you included <whoever the fuck else> instead?\n\nI hate you, and your favorite childhood idols specifically.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678153878.0},{"title":"How untouchable are Verlander's slider and fastball vs. deGrom's?

I\u2019m here as a representative of \/r\/BaseballbytheNumbers, a baseball simulation game played through reddit and discord. We\u2019ve posted here in previous seasons, and currently, we are in the postseason of our 8th season and gearing up for our 9th! This makes it the perfect time to come and check us out, as there\u2019s both playoff hype for current teams, and our Rookie League will be starting soon for any new signups! It\u2019s a great chance to see how the game is played and also interact with the community. Signing up now and participating will allow you to build your draft stock for season 9 and find like-minded individuals in team clubhouses, while also learning how to play the game.   \n\nWho are we? Baseball By the Numbers (also known as Major League Numberball or MLN for short) is a baseball simulation game. If you join up you become a player in the league and will be drafted onto a team filled with up to 16 other people. The game has light RPG elements, where you create your player and their abilities and can do some role-playing if you like in various parts of the server or during your at-bats, though this is by no means necessary. The basic mechanic of the game takes place on reddit threads, where hitters try to guess the pitchers' number, ranging from 1-1000. The closer you guess, the better the result. The game threads are posted to Reddit, but the community is active on Discord where we make friends, talk trash, and do some role-playing as our player characters. \n\n  \n\nGames last about 10 days and a season lasts about 6 months. We have a close-knit community that has been running strong for over three years. There are lots of other events and games that the community plays together including our own Fantasy League based on what happens in the game as well as countless fantasy leagues for real sports. It's a great place to make friends, have fun, and pretend to be a baseball player! \n\n  \n\nThere is no cost to play, ever. The commitment can range from a couple of minutes per week to complete addiction where you find yourself checking your phone every 10 seconds. It's entirely up to you. We look forward to getting to meet you and hope to see you soon! \n\nOur Subreddit: [\/r\/BaseballbytheNumbers](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BaseballbytheNumbers\/new\/)\n\nThe Rookie League Discord Server: [Rookie League Numberball](https:\/\/discord.gg\/tY5bvVChFM)\n\nSignup Sheet for Season 9: [Player Signups - Season 9](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/1akYbQOr1W6NC86BG8T7kAgUttnIiPB9hO4tzLB5c9gU\/edit)","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678126400.0},{"title":"Who are the Chicago American Giants?","author":"ChangingSuccession","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7WPxDMLAoK4","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678121389.0},{"title":"There is only one captain in Baseball?
