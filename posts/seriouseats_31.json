Smells delicious, turned out great, my question is just: what do I do with it all?\n\nIt ended up making a lot, so I'm wondering should I reduce it and concentrate it more? What do y'all normally do with this much stock? Good recipes that really benefit from homemade stock versus store bought?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "This is one of my most favorite subs on Reddit and I thought I'd share a secret of how Vietnamese people clean seafood to get rid of unpleasant gamey/fishy odors. My people have been pulling fish straight out of the mud in rice paddies to eat for eons, and this is how we get even the muddiest of fishes to taste fresh, sweet, clean, and delicious.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not a fancy fish scientist (unfortunately), so I can't get into specifics about what makes fish taste \"fishy\" or explain why this method works the way it does. But it DOES work, and that's what's important.\n\nOften when people complain about \"fishy\" odors or flavors, what they're referring to is that funky weird taste or smell that makes fish seem \"off.\" Some people say that unpleasant odors are due to fish being not fresh enough, but this isn't always the case. I've noticed that even the freshest of fish can have a certain funk to them. \n\nLucky you, I'm about to let you in on a secret to neutralizing this funk so that your fish will taste sweet and \"clean.\" It will still taste like fish (because obviously fish will taste like fish), but it will be better, I promise. This method of cleaning fish will neutralize all of the impurities that get in the way of tasting totally pure and delicious fish flavors. \n\nHere is what you do:\n\nTake your fish (already gutted or filleted if leaving the head on makes you sad) and rinse it with cold water. Put the fish in a bowl big enough to submerge it. Sprinkle liberally with salt (kosher or table), add a generous splash of white or apple cider vinegar, then cover with cold water. Rub the fish, including the inner cavity if the fish is still whole, until some of the salt dissolves. (You don't need to rub vigorously, just agitate and swish the water around.)\n\nAt this point, you may notice some froth developing. This is totally normal. I'm not sure what causes the froth, but my mom says that it's from all of the \"impurities\" getting washed out of the fish. This is he cause of gamey, funky odors. \n\nLet the fish stay submerged in this salt and vinegar solution for 10-15 minutes then rinse again, pat dry, and proceed with your recipe.\n\nYou will notice from handling the fish that the fish is now significantly less slimy. This slime is  what makes the fish smell and taste gamey/fishy/funky. You won't be able to taste the vinegar, but your fish will now taste much sweeter and \"purer,\" if that makes sense.\n\nWith the exception of crab and crawfish (which I can't eat anyway because of a shellfish allergy), I clean all of my seafood this way, including shrimp. It makes a big difference.\n\nIf you decide to try out this method, I would love to hear feedback. Enjoy!",

If it were just with mayo, I'd guess it was breaking the emulsification, but why does it do it to plain dijon as well?",

        "text": "I'm making an attempt at making sous vide burgers with home ground beef chuck for the first time and had some questions. The two Serious Eats articles I'm referencing are these (both links are mobile):\n\nhttp://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2013/08/the-burger-lab-how-coarsely-should-i-grind-my-burger.html\n\nhttp://www.seriouseats.com/2015/08/the-food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-burger.html\n\nFor the grind, the article posits a finer grind for grill and smashed burgers, and a coarse grind for pan seared. My plan is to sous vide the meat and then finish on a cast iron pan - does this mean I should go with a coarser grind? Or are the benefits of using a coarser grind mitigated by cooking sous vide?\n\nFor the sous vide, the second article mentions that the burger will/should gain 10 degrees internal while searing; however, the article also says burgers, unlike steaks, should rest after removed from the water bath - I would expect a temperature loss here during resting. If I'm aiming to have the burger served at 133-135, does that mean a) I should set the sous vide temperature to 123-125, rest, then Sear or b) sous vide at 133-135, rest, then Sear?\n\nThanks for any help!",
