Ultimately that makes Kurita's decision to determine if he could do enough damage to be worth the sacrifice of his fleet. \n\nHad the Japanese stayed in contact, would the various American forces that were nearby been able to put together a meaningful strike against them?",

If so, who attended on each side - diplomats, politicians, merchants, other roles? And what would have been a typical set of agenda and goals?\n\nFor example: England's wool export evolved from just the fleeces to ever finer grades of cloth, &amp; by the 17th c England was importing very fine Spanish merino wool to blend in &amp; produce their 'New Draperies' cloth, which England then exported throughout Europe including Southern Europe. Did this just happen, one deal at a time? Or at any point would a group of English people have gone to Spain to talk over mutual opportunities in wool and other trade goods?\n\nThis is for a book - a potential plot point involves an English merchant/spy attaching himself to a trade delegation to Spain in the early 1620s. I'm concerned that the concept of a 'trade delegation' might be 100 yrs or more too early for this time period.\n\nThere's much on the internet about clashes and treaties between the English, Spanish and Dutch on their competing global colonial trade interests via the EIC, VO &amp; etc; but I believe these types of negotiations would've been conducted at the highest levels, and against the backdrop of looming or actual war.",

Taking inspiration from Bronn the Sell-sword, I was wondering how often the actual knights and sell-swords drank at that time. \n\nWhile I am in no way trained to use a sword, I have had knife training and in complete honestly am half a bottle down myself, and would in no way be able to apply the training I have had if I was to get into an altercation. \n\nSo this got me wondering, is it realistic that those with fighting based jobs would drink as much as they did in the show at the time? I understand there's liberty to bend history with making a show, but I am also aware alcohol consumption of ale and beer was very high during that period - and surely it would impact ones swordsmanship, unless tolerance was incredibly high or they were simply accustomed to sloppy battles. \n\nAs previously mentioned, I am asking out of curiosity of being tipsy myself, so please do not judge my lack of ignorance, I have no historical knowledge as I was never given the opportunity during my education (my school would not let me take history so I never pursued it later on in life).

        "text": "My impression of how people thought about money in the early 1800's is that it was always expressed in the sense of income. For example, in Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy is considered wealthy due to his estate generating 10,000 pounds per year in income. His estate had no intrinsic value, it was valuable *because* it generated income.\n\nIn the modern world, money is considered to have three simultaneous roles to be of use:\n\n1. Medium of exchange\n2. Store of value\n3. Unit of account\n\nMoney is used in everyday transactions and budgeting but is also used to value ownership of existing assets (capital). Today, I can sell an ownership share in a corporation and use the proceeds to buy my groceries.\n\nThere has certainly been a maturation and sophistication of financial markets in the past 200 years. But I'm wondering if there has also been a fundamental shift in attitudes with respect to using the same unit of measurement for both everyday commerce and expressing the value of what someone owned. Did people in the early 1800s not consider their assets (estates, land, buildings, etc.) themselves to be equivalent to a certain amount of income?",

For example, previous superpowers in the world like Greece, Rome, Turkey (Ottoman), Iran (Persia). Why do they not show more of a pride in their previous cultures, being one of the worlds greatest powers. I mainly came up with this looking at Greece, and seeing just how little inspiration they seem to take from their past. \n\nWhy do they not have symbology on their military uniforms? Soldiers wear helmets, why not incorporate Spartan designs into modern day Greek army uniforms? maybe not a full helmet, but the design of them or the plume. The Hellenic Parliamentary building in Athens is just so… modern, outside of the columns you could tell me that building is in Canada, or Australia, or Scotland and i would believe you. Why don’t they take inspiration from ancient greek architecture with some modern twists?\n\nNow i may be an idiot and there may be good valid reasons behind why they don’t, i am just curious and y’all are smarter in this topic than i am. \n\nthank you :)",

Like there have been 2 great WW1 movies in the last 30 years like 1917 and All quiet on the western front, while in the same timeframe, there have been countless movies and documentaries about WW2, which I think is a big shame WW1 is just as interesting if not more than WW2. On top of that, it was just brutality on a whole other level. WW1 had around 40 Million casualties and WW2 had around 70-85 but I do not think this justifies the ignorance of WW1.\n\n**What do you guys think?**",

        "text": "Gallons. The household descriptor for \"big liquid container\", until replaced by the Metric system's liter. Many units are derived from it, from quarts and teaspoons, to barrels and tuns. But where did it come from, and for what purpose was it created? \n\nMy delve into madness began with pirates. I was researching 18th century \"golden age\" pirates after being inspired by a video game. Sea of Thieves features a drink called \"grog\" which I assumed, until today, was typical for pirate consumption. But then I discovered that it wasn't \"invented\" until just after the pirate's age in 1740 by a Navy Vice-Admiral with the nickname of \"Old Grog\". I was trying to find out the exact volume of their rum ration. \n\nThe Wikipedia article on Grog ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grog)) states that the Navy sailors' daily ration of rum at the time was one-half of an imperial pint. Clicking through to that measurement, I found it odd that the exact measurement was given for a system the British parliament didn't implement until 1824. That's 84 years after grog and \\~160 years after rum replaced beer and brandy as the standard rationed alcohol, according to the article. I read the discussion page as to why it was presented this way and found the British Empire was using two standard gallons; the wine gallon at 231 cubic inches (as of 1707), and the ale gallon at 282 cubic inches (never standardized). The ale gallon is supposedly closer to the modern Imperial gallon, and that's why it was used. \n\nThen I tried to find out why the ale gallon was larger and why there were two separate measurements, but to no avail. I then searched for the history of the gallon and the earliest mentions I found said it originated as the base of systems for measuring wine and beer in England. No mention on exactly what measurement it was based on. So, of course, I looked further back at the history of measurements and found England got their system of measurements from the Roman Empire. \n\nAs it turns out, the Ancient Romans had a gallon, too. Also used for alcohol, per Cato. That was then divided into smaller \"cups\". Sounds familiar. They called it the \"congius\". And then the Ancient Greeks had a gallon, the \"χοῦς\" (chous). And then the Ancient Egyptians had a gallon, the Heqat or Barrel. And then the Ancient Mesopotamians had a Royal Gur-Cube that, by my calculations, divides down to their \"vessel\", or about what we'd call a half-gallon. Not to mention, this gur-cube is now based on modern measurements for some reason. All of these are relatively similar measurements, from between around .8-1.2 gallons. \n\nSo is the gallon just an arbitrary measurement of a typical vessel used to put alcohol in that's been passed down through the millennia and we still use it for that purpose until just recently? I suppose a stronger question would be how much of the history of measurements has the metric system destroyed at this point? I'm just another anonymous Wikipedia warrior but when I run into dead ends on there, I can't seem to find anything anywhere else. There is no unified article on ancient units of measurements on Wikipedia that I could find. \n\nPlease let me know of any historical inaccuracies or logical fallacies I may have stumbled into. Also, I really hope this falls under this subreddit's jurisdiction.",

Much like in the US, returning servicemen were rejected and shunned by their fellow countrymen, one veteran told me that he was spat on at the airport when he arrived back home from Vietnam. Australian and New Zealand veterans didn't receive proper recognition for their service until decades later.\n\nThe United States involvement in the war is of course very well documented, as is the anti-war movement and the various large protests against the war, as well as the clashes with government officials like the massacre at Kent State University, and the complete lack of respect or recognition returning soldiers faced, many suffering from PTSD. \n\nI realised though that I know very little about the experiences of the other nations that joined the fight in Vietnam like South Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines. South Korea especially sent a very large number of personnel to Vietnam, and I imagine that coming off their own civil war against communism a decade prior, the attitude and public opinion on the Vietnam war back home in Korea might have been very different to that in the west.
