my question and my friends' questions weren't too bad, but you could get harder ones if unlucky or a bar raiser interviews you\n      * Brush up and be able to demonstrate the leadership principles well, as they are kinda cultish about that\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Apple:**\n   * Was ghosted quite a few times applying in the past, like others have complained about\n   * To get unghosted, I reached out and DM'ed engineering managers (EMs) on LinkedIn working in areas I had experience in (whether it be in past internships\/projects)\n      * On LinkedIn, the EM's description or tagline usually indicates if they're hiring, but it never hurts to reach out\n      * If the EM is interested in you, they will force their recruiter to look at your resume which may lead to an interview\n      * The way other people I know have gotten interviews is by attending university recruiting\/networking events Apple has held\n   * I had one recruiter screening, followed by an informal phone interview with the EM to talk about my background and make sure the team was a fit\n   * I had a phone interview with an engineer who asked about networks\/systems trivia and a systems-focused LC question (dude was a C\/C++ boomer who did not appreciate me giving a Python solution :sadge:)\n   * Had I reached the onsite, there would be a day-long interview loop with other engineers on the team asking LC or about skills\/projects on my resume\n   * *Takeaways:*\n      * Network well to get an interview -

I am a full time Journeyman Industrial Mechanic for one of the big three American Automakers. I have a significant amount of down\/free time at work which has allowed me to pursue higher education. I currently am attending University of Maryland Global Campus. This fall I will be going into my 2nd year of undergrad. Now I will get to my question(s).. \n\nMy initial plan was to transfer to Oregon State University this fall as a full time online student for their BS in CS, and to finish my degree in 3 years. I planned to transfer there because from what I've read, they seem to have a more rigorous and respected program compared to UMGC. Recently I discovered that UMGC is accepting training from my time in the military as 30 elective credit hours. In doing so, my degree would only take 2 years to complete, compared to 3 years at OSU. \n\nTo get to my point: \n\nI am a full time working adult, with a family in children, and I work in a unrelated career field. So internships\/co-ops are off the table. My goal with obtaining my degree is to learn as much as possible and become as prepared   As possible to change careers. My degree is not to check a box. \n\nShould I stick to my original plan of 3 years of education at OSU in their CS program, or should I finish an accelerated path at UMGC and try to get into the field a year sooner? Both degrees would be a BS in CS. I would still take all major and gen ed requirements. I would take little to no electives at UMGC, and would take 30 credit hours of electives at OSU. \n\nNeither school cost me anything because of my GI Bill and employer tuition assistance. \n\nBeing in the Midwest, does either school hold more weight over the other? \n\nSince I have no work experience in this field, would OSU program prepare me more than UMGC? Or would UMGC prepare me enough and I should start working sooner?\n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678571215.0},{"title":"SWE positions?","author":"Oraclepr0","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11ow1y3\/swe_positions\/","text":"Are there still anymore places taking applications for SWE or Data Science internships?

However, I am unsure if this research will be relevant to improve my resume and help me get into a top-tier grad school.

While I am pretty sure I could get a research position with the CS faculty, I won't get much help from them, and they are known for just changing the name on a recommendation letter template they have.

You do very little comp sci in your whole college career. Most of the CS you do learn is theory, which is important don\u2019t get me wrong but since we do very little CS you aren\u2019t getting what you need to get basic a job.\n\nPlus I don\u2019t think I Calc 3 and Quantum Physics should be required for a CS major (these are actual current requirements at my university).\n\n2) It\u2019s hard and time consuming!\n\nLike I mentioned previously, all these weed out classes are hard and suck out most of your time and energy leaving you time for nothing else.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for the wrong reasons, I\u2019m not complaining about the CS part I\u2019m complaining about the weed out Physics classes and Math classes, I didn\u2019t sign up for this \ud83d\ude2d.\n\n3) No time to learn practical CS on your own \/ work on side projects\n\nIt\u2019s well known, especially in this sub, you need a good resume with practice experience and side projects to get a good job offer.

You won\u2019t have much time to grind leet code if you too busy failing some hard ass 4 credit class which is not even your area of interest.\n\n4) I feel bad\n\nI feel bad for the people who did the CS major soly for the purpose that they will get a high paying job after graduation.

I am open to comments and criticism but the purpose is mostly just to share what I experienced\/learned along the way in hopes that you may take something away for your own journey.\n\n**Background:** \n\nI am currently a 5th year senior at a top 20 university, but *not* a CS major. I came into the school as a music performance major (2018) and basically wasted 2 years (not to say that I didn't get anywhere, but I didn't have any sort of direction. Just liked music and was good at it so I \"pursued\" it). When COVID hit, I realized the *risky* financial outlook of being a part of the gig economy and looked towards something more stable. I switched to a Psychology major (as it was very relevant to the mental health struggles of the time for many, including myself). Many of my peers at the time were CS majors or in the software industry - so I decided to take an intro class to programming (Jan 2022) to see if it was something I was a) capable of \"doing\" b) at least semi-enjoyed doing (more so if I hated it or not). I did well, but didn't stand out (I would not say I am naturally really smart, pretty average). I decided to take the next course (May 2022) in the curriculum (basic data structures, no full on DSA yet) which was certainly more challenging but I had the same outcome as the first class. It was at this point that I had an interesting situation -\n\nThe next course in the progression was the classic DSA course, but in order to take it I had to take several prerequisites (which would extend my time in school to at least a total of 6 years).\n\nThe other option (one I ended up taking) was to teach myself DSA and just go for jobs.\n\nI have family who work in the industry, and after long conversations my general approach at the time was the following: \n\n**1)** ***Get*** **an interview -**\n\nI had to figure out a way to prove that I actually knew anything, and wasn't just another \"self-taught\" programmer from tiktok (sorry if this is offensive to anyone). This meant building projects, or anything that could plausibly demonstrate that I at least had some potential.\n\n**2)** ***Do well*** **on the interview -**\n\nStudy the DSA course through the lecture recordings, do the projects in the course (albeit without the grading, had to keep myself accountable) and do leetcode adjacently. Point being that I needed a more solid foundation, not just being able to recognize basic code.\n\n**Summer 2022:**\n\nSo I began the journey around July (and here is my [leetcode profile](https:\/\/leetcode.com\/jespie\/) if you want to see the tangible journey in progress and hold me accountable for my writing here) and worked on 2 (doing well on the interview) first. It was *extremely* difficult, grasping the concepts on my own was a huge challenge and required around 10 -12 hours\/day of studying per day to feel like I was actually learning. In hindsight I wish I focused more on learning DSA concepts before attempting to leetcode, but I did both adjacently due to the fact that I wanted to be \"ready\" for job interviewing by the time fall came around (how naive). For emphasis on where I was at, one of my first leetcode attempts involved binary search of a sorted array, in which I proceeded to implement an entire binary search tree as I thought that binary search required a BST to actually work.\n\nAfter essentially one month of *very* intense studying and leetcode, and *very basic* work on some projects, here were my stats:\n\n\\~ Around 100 leetcode questions complete (mostly easy), more on my approach later\n\n\\~ Completed DSA course with all projects done and a basic understanding of the concepts (but not really the applications for them)\n\n\\~ 1 static webpage using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS\n\nIt was at this point I felt I was \"ready\" to interview. haha.\n\n**Fall 2022:**\n\nI attended the school career fair in early September 2022 (was also blind applying online) and quickly realized how little I knew. I was turned away by most employers who mentioned they were only interested in CS majors, but I had one chance with JPMC (Chase bank). They had a program called Tech Connect which was essentially for self-taught people like me, and the recruiter at the career fair was kind enough to give me a referral to the program. There was an OA and HireVue, after which was the final round with two 45-minute interviews: One behavioral and one technical.\n\nI did well on the technical and behavioral until the last question on the behavioral which was \"Tell me about a time you failed\". I completely froze and had no response, and could see the visual disappointment in my interviewer's face. I did not get the offer and I was devastated (as I felt this was my only chance of getting a job suited towards my situation). The worst part of this was I had a CS major friend who I convinced to do mock interviews and apply to jobs together (and was objectively lazy and complacent before, no offense) who ended up getting the JPMC offer (for regular SWE) after I told him about my talk with them at the career fair.\n\nAt this point I was determined to get *something* so I continued the grind, working on more complex web applications (i.e. learning basic React, Angular, Django, Node, etc.). I vowed to learn *something* everyday which was manifested in the form of the daily leetcode question, bits of projects, etc. I also realized there was nothing on my resume that supported an employer's recognition for my skill (As in I had no coding-related job) so I applied to some teaching gigs and landed one at my school (tutoring of AP CS students). I was also fortunate enough to land an IA (Instructional Aide) position for the second coding class.\n\n**Jan 2022:**\n\nFrom here I *constantly* applied to jobs, at least 10\/day was the rule I made for myself. While still doing daily leetcode and working on projects. Come mid-late February I get *actual* responses - some invitations to interviews (mind you *none* of my applications had referrals with the exception of JPMC). I've had 4 interviews in the past 3 weeks and am now fortunate to say I have received an offer (details to come). \n\n**My main learnings:**\n\n\\~ Leetcode is a *process,* sure you can argue on the validity of it as a method for interviews - but I'm not here to challenge the system, and it also gives as much as you put into it. There **are no shortcuts.** If you just look at the answer when you get stuck, you're going to learn how to look at the answer. My approach was to try for *at least* 20 minutes without looking at *anything* other than the problem - then I would go to the \"related topics\" section to maybe get some guidance, and my last resort was looking up the Neetcode video. I hated it at first, but quickly realized that I only hated that I couldn't solve the problems - I began to *like* it, but only as a result of taking it seriously and actively putting forth an effort to *learn* and *get better*.\n\n\\~ Projects are extremely daunting, but everyone has to start somewhere. I struggled a lot with the notion of just building a website or mobile app - but the approach that helped me the most was \"only learning what I had to in order to accomplish my goal\". For example, if I wanted to build a restaurant website, I was not going to learn HTML from the ground up, but rather only learn what I really had to know in order to make the damn thing work.\n\n\\~ Mental Health is *key*, if I were to have a second chance, I would have taken the extra year in school and preserved my sanity. Having motivation is essential to this process, and just doing it for some blank reason would certainly lead to burnout and long-term problems.\n\n\\~ Don't let others define what your path is (especially social media). I think an interesting phenomenon was\/is the \"Day in the life of a SWE at \\[insert FAANG company here\\]\" and \"How I became a SWE without a degree\". These attracted so many people to try programming, but also induced a false belief in many that becoming\/being a SWE is easy. It may be for some, but it certainly was not for me. I am not trying to be negative, but rather realistic. It was a terribly challenging journey for me, and I wish I would have never had the belief that it would be easy, or that 100 leetcode easies would get me a 6 figure job - but nonetheless here I am.\n\n**My offer:** 105k TC, good benefits, in-person for a mega healthcare software company. It is not an actual SWE role, but software adjacent.\n\n**My final thoughts:**\n\n\\~ Do **NOT** compare yourself to others, be realistic with yourself and where you are at. The more you begin the think that you are better\/worse than people around you, the more detached from the actual goal of improving and landing a job you become.\n\n\\~ Nothing is possible without consistency. No one (I think) can just learn all of DSA in one night and get a job offer. Most people could probably study some DSA and leetcode daily and get a job after a year. Like I mentioned above, it is a *process -* and not an overnight one. The point being slow and steady learning will not only allow you more time to fully understand your learning, but also allow for you to see a clear timeline of progress.\n\n\\~ Making conscious (or even physical) note of your accomplishments is **huge**. I will admit I did not always do this, but towards the latter half of my journey I began to keep track of what I was learning and when. Being able to see in physical form what I had been learning\/achieving was insanely helpful for me, and helped me stay sane\/feel like I was actually doing something.\n\n\\~ Here are some references that were the most important throughout my journey:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/o3r0wt\/a\\_journey\\_from\\_one\\_year\\_of\\_unemployment\\_to\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cscareerquestions\/comments\/o3r0wt\/a_journey_from_one_year_of_unemployment_to\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n['How to Get a Job at the Big 4 - Amazon, Facebook, Google & Microsoft' by Sean Lee](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YJZCUhxNCv8&t=1378s)","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678477977.0},{"title":"Does practicing Leetcode help you get interviews or does it only help you in interviews?","author":"Apprehensive-Ad-8099","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11nyv3t\/does_practicing_leetcode_help_you_get_interviews\/","text":"I'm applying for internships but Is there any point in practicing Leetcode if I'm not getting any interviews?","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678477718.0},{"title":"Any thoughts and advice on the Tech Incubator Internship at Capital One?","author":"throwaway_cs101","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11oco6k\/any_thoughts_and_advice_on_the_tech_incubator\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678515610.0},{"title":"how to prepare for an sre interview?","author":"duncecapwinner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11o9wlt\/how_to_prepare_for_an_sre_interview\/","text":"I have an interview for an sre role coming up and I have no idea what kind of technical questions to expect. the team I'm interviewing for deals with cloud and kubernetes (presumably), and I'm expecting questions on distributed systems, networking, and more. what kind of questions can I be expect? in general, what should i emphasize in preparation?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678506497.0},{"title":"Future career after summer internship at LLNL","author":"Formal-That","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11o9rv2\/future_career_after_summer_internship_at_llnl\/","text":"Anyone got any idea about Machine learning (DSSI) internship at LLNL.

I'll have work satisfaction in either case. Help me evaluate the cons of choosing an ML path. Please let me know if my fears are valid. Please also point out some pros of pursuing ML that might overcome the cons I have listed.\n\n\nI am at a crossroads now. I have an admission for a master's in electrical engineering from a good US university, and I have to make a choice between specializing in AI\/ML or embedded systems. I have had a fair bit of experience in both, and I can safely say that I like both. Thus, I am now thinking about factors like pay and the competitiveness of each field. I have identified the following points when it comes to AI and ML:\n\n\n1. I have seen Mechanical Engineering, Instrumentation Engineering, and even Chemical Engineering graduates pursue a great career in ML. The field seems to accept virtually everyone, irrespective of their backgrounds. Isn't it getting SUPER competitive? Are the ML jobs increasing in proportion to the rising number of applicants or aspirants? However, I haven't really seen this happen in the embedded systems field. For example, a mechanical engineering graduate cannot just prepare for 6\u201310 months for the role and land a job in embedded systems. The domain knowledge, especially hardware, would take much more time and effort to master. There's this \"niche\" and \"exclusivity\" factor when it comes to embedded, unlike ML.\n\n\n\n2. Moreover, experience really counts in the embedded industry. For example, a newbie cannot just replace an embedded hardware guy with five years of work experience. An experienced guy in the embedded field is valuable. Whereas I believe an experienced guy is comparatively more replaceable in the AI\/ML field (correct me if I'm wrong).\n\n\nRemember how there was this IT boom back when our fathers graduated (1990s)? Similar to the ML scenario today, people entered IT irrespective of their backgrounds, and fast forward 25 years; all have now made tons of money and are living happily. Is it correct to go against pursuing ML because of the above reasons? Is it okay to opt for a field that pays relatively less as compared to ML for the above reasons?\u00a0\n\n\nOr will I be missing out on riding a money-making wave like the IT one I mentioned above? Again, I like both, and I'll be equally happy pursuing either as far as work satisfaction is concerned.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678446707.0},{"title":"2022 vs 2023 Internship Applications Stats w\/ Sankey Diagrams!","author":"1234oguz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11n63jq\/2022_vs_2023_internship_applications_stats_w\/","text":"Edit: kind of hard to keep up with the dm's, and i see the same q's pop up often.

I have been beaten down trying to get an internship for this summer as you might remember from [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/z89i8h\/list_of_companies_that_were_nice_enough_to_reject\/) and [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11cqj44\/update_ghost_list_list_of_companies_that_were\/) post.\n\nI got pretty lucky to have an amazing offer. But, I still wanted to visualize how hard it was to get internship offers this year vs last year using Sankey Diagrams.\n\nI put a good amount of time tracking my applications, and creating the diagrams so I hope it helps you guys. With that being said, here are the graphs:\n\n[**2022 Internship Applications Sankey Diagram**](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/AXvlofM.png)\n\n[**2023 Internship Applications Sankey Diagram**](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/NH1NGzS.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo put things into perspective, here are my stats:\n\n**2022 Stats:**\n\nStanding: Rising Junior\n\nVerified CodeSignal Score: 788\n\n1 Prior Internship at a local company\n\nResume: 5.5\/10 (Subjective, IMO)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Number of Applications: 65\n\n\\- Number of Offers: 6\n\nAccepted Offer: FAANG Adjacent Unicorn\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2023 Stats:**\n\nStanding: Rising Senior\n\nVerified CodeSignal Score: 842\n\n2 Internships: 1 Unicorn, 1 Small Company\n\nResume: 8\/10 (Subjective, IMO)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Number of Applications: 316\n\n\\- Number of Offers: 3\n\nAccepted Offer: FAANG Adjacent Startup\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\nI really believe more than 60% of getting an offer is **pure luck**. I got lucky enough to get offers, but at the same time I could definitely see myself not getting an offer both seasons. That is why I think you spray & pray with your applications to increase your odds of getting lucky.\n\nThere definitely are other things you can do to increase your odds. I'll share a few things here, but want to keep this post short:\n\n* Do the damn Blind 75\n   * Take notes for every question, and make sure you fully understand each question before moving on.\n   * Don't spend more than \\~60 mins on a question. If you cant do the question by yourself in \\~30 mins, just watch Neetcode and\/or look at leetcode solutions.\n   * Try to do 1 LeetCode Question Per Day at Least.\n* Do LeetCode Company Tagged questions\n   * LeetCode premium is a life saver. But if you don't want to spend money, pretty sure the company tagged questions get leaked every now and then.\n* Beg for Referrals\n* Research Interview formats on LeetCode Discussions and r\/csMajors\n* I got more stuff that helps me, but I feel like this post has gotten long enough. Feel free to DM\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nI check r\/csmajors almost every day. I really enjoy reading the posts\/talking to y'all so I would love to give back to the community. If you are a lower classman (HS, Freshman, Sophomore), feel free to comment here or DM me for advice for the next recruiting season. We can chat on this post, or set up a 15-30 min talk on zoom. Anyone else could chat as well tbh if you wanna chat. Regardless, good luck to y'all and see you on the next post! :)","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678401107.0},{"title":"Has anybody interviewed for Accenture technology innovation - labs visiting researcher?","author":"Always_right101","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11nsnuj\/has_anybody_interviewed_for_accenture_technology\/","text":"its a summer internship position","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678463364.0},{"title":"Blackrock Technology Operations Intern or Qualcomm SWE Internship","author":"Agreeable_Interest_5","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11o1tm8\/blackrock_technology_operations_intern_or\/","text":"Which one is better?

For context, I\u2019m a current senior, not at a top school, working at a quant firm postgrad with a TC of 300-400k. On a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I\u2019m going to discuss a few things I learned while getting a job during the recent recession, including some of the key mistakes I made, how to get the job you want, and how to be recession-proof as an engineer. Realistically, it is reasonable to say that we will be out of recession territory within two years. I\u2019m basing this on current Federal Reserve policy and market estimates. A lot of people are getting screwed by the market right now, and it sucks to see. If you\u2019re feeling nervous about the current state of hiring, by the time you are looking for a job, it will likely be better.\n\nIn the process of trying to get a tech job, one of the things that is often brought up is university ranking. It is obviously much easier to get a high paying job if you go to Stanford as opposed to a school outside the T100, but it\u2019s doable regardless of school. Don\u2019t let someone tell you that you can\u2019t get the job you want based on your school. Let\u2019s look at a few examples. The subreddit seems to love Google, so we will use Google as our target company.\n\n* Clemson, ranked #111 for CS programs, has 209 employees at Google.\n* DePaul, ranked #122, has 396 employees at Google.\n* West Virginia University, ranked outside of the top 300, has 122 employees at Google.\n\nThis is a significant number. Based on available LinkedIn data, about half of these are software engineers. The rest are design, business, or other tangential roles. It\u2019s possible to get the job you want, regardless of your university.\n\nSo how do you actually go about getting the job? There are a number of factors everyone lists, including Leetcode, networking, personal projects, grades, etc. I\u2019m going to take a bit of a different spin on this and talk about something related to \u201cnon-linear payoffs.\u201d This phenomena is important in fields like derivative pricing, evolutionary game theory, and others.\n\nImagine you are the CTO of a successful company and have been tasked with finding a service to keep your other company systems operational. You are in a high-stakes environment, and need this service to crash as infrequently as possible. You can get this service from two different corporations: A Corp, and B Corp. These two companies offer nearly identical products, except for the fact that A Corp operates correctly 98% of the time, while B Corp operates correctly 99% of the time. It seems clear that the best decision is to pick B Corp every single time. This is interesting, however, because despite only being **1%** more effective, *B Corp gets* ***100%*** *of the business* from the client. An incremental, marginal improvement over the playing field resulted in B Corp getting the whole pie, and A Corp getting none of it.\n\nThis is relevant to the job market. Following the above example, if the CTO is the tech company, you need to make sure you are B Corp. Simply put, being slightly better than other applicants will result in you getting the job offer significantly more often.\n\nThis raises yet another question: how does one outshine the other applicants? Although things like Leetcode are important, I would argue the key distinguishing feature is depth, not breadth, of knowledge. Again, let\u2019s look at an example. Suppose you are a hiring manager at a tech company and want to build a full-stack platform. You have three roles to fill: a network engineer, a web developer, and a data scientist. Which group would you rather hire: an elite network engineer, an elite web developer, and an elite data scientist OR three people who are good at each role. You would obviously pick the first group. They want a well-rounded incoming group of engineers, but they want each engineer to be an expert at something different.\n\nThis is how tech companies think. There is an order of magnitude level difference between the best and average programmers, so being one of the best will get you huge, non-linear payoffs relative to your skill. Many of these companies bring in so much money they\u2019re willing to pay you exorbitant amounts of money if you have the skills they need. To distinguish yourself, become a true expert in a specific area.\n\nOne can start by seeking to acquire knowledge that is specialized, difficult to replicate, and critical to core services of a business. It might be hard to figure this out, but you can learn a lot from networking with older students, reading some research and computer science blogs, as well as studying topics on your own. It\u2019s on you to acquire knowledge depth. University will teach you the required breadth of knowledge, but if you want to get one of the top jobs, you have do more than just \u2018hack\u2019 the job application process. You have to have deep knowledge.\n\nFor Leetcode, whatever you do, don\u2019t memorize the questions. Some recommend memorizing these. I don\u2019t agree with this, and I made this mistake as a sophomore. You run the risk of getting absolutely blindsided by a random question from your interviewer. A good interviewer or engineer will care far more about you being able to digest the structure of the problem and respond to it, and will quickly figure out what you memorized versus what you actually understand. I passed interviews at multiple quant firms, Google, Amazon, and Apple by just doing the Blind 75. Understand the data structure at a very basic level and work upwards from there, adding on layers as necessary. If you\u2019re able to solve a problem from just the basic axioms, much like a formal proof, I would argue you truly understand it at that point. I can provide some examples in the comments if needed.\n\nRelated to projects, they are actually quite important as they help apply your learnings and get real experience with building systems. However, it is unlikely that an interviewer will care at all if your projects are simply doing the bare minimum for something like \u201cbuilding a personal website.\u201d Projects you care about are obvious to people. The goal of projects, from the recruiting standpoint, is to see if you have a ***demonstrated interest*** in computer science. Projects should not be something just to \u201ccheck the box,\u201d they are a reflection of your interests and your skill level.\n\nLastly, how does one become recession-proof? If you set out to have deep knowledge in a niche area, you\u2019re in a great spot already. Another thing that helps is picking a team or an area that generates value. If we look at the current tech layoffs, we notice a few trends. First, the majority of layoffs came from teams and areas that don\u2019t generate a lot of monetary business value. Engineers who weren\u2019t providing much **explicit** value, such as engineers who aren\u2019t writing code, seem to be the first to get laid off. Other tech layoffs include non-critical engineering roles such as support roles. Engineers on teams who provide a quantifiable amount of value, in terms of dollars, have been fired less often than others during this recession.\n\nGood luck to everyone! You can do it if you put the work in.

I want to move there because I feel like if I stay at home I won't be able to focus and give uni my all, I have big aspirations for my time in uni and really want to do well, and I've learned that I far much better in terms of education when I'm left alone to focus on my own, there are way too many distractions that happen at home and I'm afraid it will affect my uni time. \n\nUnfortunately for me, most people around me don't understand this because schools A and B are super well ranked nationally (we're immigrants and going to \"the best\" school is kind of the only thing they know about) and C is pretty unknown even though it has better resources and better opportunities in research. \n\nTLDR: Do I go to a tier 1 school and risk having a bad academic life, or a tier 2 school and know that I'll do amazing there?\n\nAny recommendations?

This year is my second year in my graduate program. Last year I applied over 300+ applications but only got 3 interview invitations, and I got a FAANG Spring coop offer. Now I am doing this internship. I still want to find a Summer internship, so I included my current internship experience in my resume. However, I surprisingly found that I still had the difficulty getting interview invitation like last year. I tried to ask some experienced engineers for resume tips, each of them thinks there is no problem with my resume whereas, as you can see, I still have no Summer offer. I also posted my resume in reddit but no one replied. Sometimes I think if I made a wrong decision to make a transition into tech. I follow every general tip including but not limit to adding leadership experience and hackathon experience, but never received invitation as before. I really don't want to mention the so-called diversity hire, but I did feel the hopeless and helpless of being an Asian male international student.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes I even don't know where I was doing wrong, and I think what I all have done is meaningless. Take my previous roomate for example, he also comes from a non-cs backgroud, and he even did not do any project by himself. He spent most of time grinding leetcode, putting fake projects into his resume, and faking his previous professional as a software engineer. In this way, he got 6 offers last year. His summer offer got rescind in this month, but he got a new offer from Apple today. It is APPLE. By seeing his experience, I really can't find the necessity of making technical projects and revise resume again and again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan anyone give me some suggestions? Should I go to see a psychologist? I cried for whole day tbh. As an unlucky Asian male international student, maybe it is totally wrong to study CS and find SDE jobs in US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you can't understand my meaning due to my poor English, I want to say sorry to you in advance.","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1678169590.0},{"title":"Is this the truth of IT MAJOR?","author":"haresholmes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11laeu7\/is_this_the_truth_of_it_major\/","text":"We are suffering now in university because we are taking basics of python in lectures and huge complicated assignments that we use chat gpt for doing then.

And also manually required to enter new internships.\n\nLinkedIn Alerts + Jobs:\n\n* Low-quality jobs, so many irrelevant ones.\n* Also poor search and filtering for the case of internships where filters such as visa sponsorship, durations, and season are vital.\n* Linkedin in general has so much spam and is more of a social media. \n\nWellfound (Angel):\n\n* Mostly startups of small scale.\n* So many no-equity\/unpaid positions from super early-scale startups.\n* Search and filter is good, and has the pros of having sponsorship filters etc.\n* Doesn't has bigger companies\/ companies apart from startups as recruiters\/users can't manually post.\n\nNewsletters:\n\n* Certain newsletters I'm subscribed to give me great suggestions\n* But they are infrequent, low quantity and don't have enough information.\n\nI am not aware of any good source specifically for students, for finding tech internships.

It seems that getting admitted as C.S. undergrad major is much harder than getting into the university overall.  If I am understanding this right, they actually will not let anyone change their major to C.S. who was admitted after Fall 2022.  That kindof surprised me, because I never ran into that issue when I was an undergrad.  I got into a college that is considerably harder to get into than UIUC overall, but has no where near as prestigious or competitive a C.S. program as UIUC.\n\nI started as a Bio major and didn't like it.  At the end of my freshman year I told my advisor I wanted to change majors and he said I could pretty much do anything I wanted because my college grades and high school background where strong enough.  He said I could go the engineering school, business school, whatever (just have to know it will take extra time to graduate.)  I ultimately chose to change to C.S. in the school of sciences.  There was no application process or anything difficult.  It was basically a procedural change and I picked new courses and that was that.\n\nIf you were in my position at UIUC and really wanted to major in C.S., what would you do?  Would you actually have to apply to whole other university as a transfer student?

My first PC games were \"Prince of Persia\" and \"Doom\" on Windows 3.11. (Yes, I am too old, I know.)\n\nFrom there I started building my first PC, got to change my first GPU a couple of years later, and spent a lot of time on IRC.\n\nThe sound of the 56K Dial-up modem is the ringtone of my phone, in case you still thought I wasn't too old already.\n\nFor those of you that have no idea of what all of the above means, just assume that this was the most advanced IT tech during the early 90s.\n\nI started working as an IT specialist for a school in Italy, where I also lived for a long time. I managed the IT infrastructure. Servers, Firewalls, Active Directory, Web Applications, CRM, Website, and everything else that was IT related, including IT assets like laptops, desk phones, the VoIP phone system, etc.\n\nRecently I moved to the UK and I am working for ServiceNow as a Technical Trainer\/Instructor.\n\nBy the way, for those of you that have not heard about it before, ServiceNow is an Application Platform as a Service (aPaaS). It's a cloud platform that makes it easier for enterprises to manage their digital workflows and make it easier for employees to get rid of those pesky, boring and repetitive daily tasks.\n\nMy job is to teach courses related to ServiceNow and the different applications\/products that ServiceNow offers.\n\nRight now I am in the process of learning about Application Development in ServiceNow and preparing to pass the exam. It's not really a difficult course but it is tricky. Application Development in ServiceNow uses mostly just JavaScript so it's easy to catch-up with it.\n\nPassing the exam itself is just the first step on becoming an instructor for that same course in the future. \n\nI would be more than happy to share my personal experience about my job in training, what I do to learn and prepare for the exams, career progression in IT or ServiceNow based on my personal experience, or anything that you might need to know about ServiceNow as a company.\n\nAsk me anything, except questions related to RegEx! \n\nI am definitely not the right person to ask about regular expressions. \ud83d\ude05","upvote_ratio":0.3,"created_utc":1678117693.0},{"title":"Do you guys take notes in lectures?","author":"Way-Current","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11jmlx5\/do_you_guys_take_notes_in_lectures\/","text":"Hi!

The whole process was so quick and the interview was so easy, that I am actually worried that perhaps that there is something wrong with this job or I am perhaps misunderstanding what it involves.  So, the co-op involves setting up data pipelines for drug development.  They wanted students in data science programs who have some knowledge of SQL, R, and Python.\n\nThe interviewer spent about half the interview on behavioral questions. The other half were very high level questions about how I would clean datasets and how I might evaluate problems in datasets.  They were very open ended question and we spoke only in the broadest generalities about data.  They asked what I thought were the most important elements of good programming practice.  Again, relatively basic, simple stuff.  There was an OA before the in person, but that OA was almost entirely behavioral questions.\n\nI mean, it's kind-of low pay for a grad co-op - only $30\/hr - but it is one of the largest pharma companies in the world and I figure the experience will have some value.  I'm just worried that I am perhaps misunderstanding what I will be doing there and maybe I really won't be learning or doing much of value.

I apologize in advice for the lengthy post, and please pardon my English and unprofessional tone as English is my fourth language. If this background is too long for you, you may skip to the later part of this post where I address my main question.\n\nI am currently pursuing a master's from a BIG10 in cs. I have been in the field as a student and throughout my years I have met many people in the field. One thing that astonishes me is the pay scale variation and its relation to location. To elaborate, I know many people - from my undergrad (another BIG10) - that chose to join the workforce after their 4 yrs of undergrad. Their starting salaries were well above 150k TC. Some of my friends were also proud to announce their salaries reaching close to the 200k TC mark. They are all in SDE\/SWE positions located in prime tech hubs in the United States such as the Bay area, Seattle, and Texas. Fast forward 2 years, my friends that once boasted about their generous pay scales informed me, and may others in my friend group, about their recent promotion and respective pay scale increase to well above the 200k TC mark. To add more fuel to this, Amazon recently announced an increase in SDE\/SWE salary to around 300k TC. My main conundrum stems from my interaction with my classmates from my master's program. Many of my classmates at my master's program come from Asia, more specifically south east Asia. They chose to pursue a masters with the hope to gain an employment in the United States in tech primarily due to its financial benefit. Most of my master's colleagues spent time in SDE\/SWE positions in their native country where they revealed to me that their pay was around the 40k TC mark (converted from their native currency to USD). Their work, as described to me, is identical to the work done by my friends from my undergrad. Moreover, the corporations in the US that my undergrad friends work for are the same ones that my master's classmates worked for in their native country. In a sense, my master's classmates' work in their native country seemed to be the same work, with the same job title, as that of my undergrad friends with the added fact that my master's classmates working conditions were not as relaxed as my undergrad friends' working conditions, and my master's classmates essentially made just twenty percent in TC of my undergrad friends.\n\n**QUESTION 1:** My question is, do SDE\/SWE positions in the United States prime tech hubs genuinely pay five times of the SDE\/SWE positions in other parts of the world? If so, why have these tech companies not taken advantage of the free market and moved their SDE\/SWE branches overseas? What is keeping these tech companies from doing so?\n\nI understand the economics of an identical job in separate countries having separate wages. Nevertheless, I do not understand why these jobs would remain in the US given that the corporation is a profit maximizing corporation and it would be in its best interest to relocate the SDE\/SWE position overseas.\n\nMany may point to the notion that the job requires physical interaction which would mean that the employees would need to be physically present in the office in the US. To this point of view, I would like to mention that most of my undergraduate friends work completely remotely. Even my undergraduate friends who are physically present in the office, are there from personal choice and often work from home without any repercussion. Not to mention that when Amazon wished to incorporate a more office centric SDE\/SWE position, it received massive resistance from people who are in the SDE\/SWE positions and have since prompted Amazon to keep the status quo. Clearly, the SDE\/SWE position can be done completely remotely!\n\n**QUESTION 2:** Will this trend of paying SDE\/SWE positions packages comparable to a doctor's salary be sustainable long term in the United States?\n\nI ask this question because of the recent massive layoffs in tech. I am worried about my future and I am confused about reality. As I have not personally yet worked in one of these positions in the US, due to visa issues, I have not been exposed the reality myself. In one hand I wish to be in tech, mainly due to its financial benefit coupled with its relaxed lifestyle as compared to may of the other jobs at this pay scale, but on the other hand I am genuinely not as passionate about tech as my peers and only want to reap the financial benefits. If the account from my undergraduate friends are inspired by mischievous yet not ill-intended boastful nature of theirs, I wish to transition to another field that excites me beyond the financial benefits.\n\nAs a closing remark, I would like tho thank those who have taken time out of their lives to read my post and address my concerns in this matter! I know that in this hyper-competitive world, people may not have the time to engage in a post of this manner. As always, any and all view points\/personal accounts\/opinions are welcome and encouraged.\n\nBest,\n\nannon\\_tech\\_007","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1677822762.0},{"title":"Having difficulty progressing academically.

The area I live in has like, no Spring internships. They're all Summer internships. So, I finally found a company that agreed to take me on as an intern starting 3\/5 and they expect me to work part-time during the Spring semester and then full time throughout Summer. The pay sucks, they only pay $15\/hour. Which is the lowest offer I've gotten.\n\nDuring the process of applying for internships, I also got an offer for a company offering me $15k for a 10 week internship starting in June. They're an insanely good company to work for.\n\nSo I accepted both internships. And my plan is basically to work at the first one that pays shittier to get my spring internship hours, then turn in 2 weeks notice halfway through May and start at the second Internship.\n\nI'm aware that this is probably not the best practice for my career, but I'm in a tough spot with trying to get my Spring internship hours and then also accepting an incredibly competitive offer for Summer. I don't need anyone to tell me that this is walking an ethical line. I'm aware that it could affect my reputation and I've decided to do what's best for me.\n\nMy main issue here is LinkedIn. I've basically just taken it off of my phone. I obviously don't want to update my LinkedIn with any employment statuses. But now the hiring manager from the first company has requested to add me to his LinkedIn network. This is what I'm asking for advice on. \n\nShould I just ignore his request? And then, if he asks me about it I can just tell him that I'm off of social media and I don't really use LinkedIn at all? Is he going to tell me that I have to have LinkedIn to work there? Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1677773592.0},{"title":"Software Engineer Internship, Frontend Live Coding Interview at Ramp","author":"Hudsonbleble123","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11gfw5e\/software_engineer_internship_frontend_live_coding\/","text":"Hi, as the title, I have mine coming soon.

Let me start by saying I love CS. There is no doubt in my mind that this is what I want to do, but I feel so far behind other people. I feel like every question I ask to a TA is utterly dumb, and I fear that I'm that person you wouldn't want to get paired with on a group assignment. From struggling with red-black trees to spending 13 hours on a project today only to realize my implementation was completely wrong and it was all for nothing. But, I like it enough to wake up and try it again tomorrow, and I hate the feeling of going to bed with a program not working or unfinished. I've never really cared about grades, I mean, I cared that I pass (As, typically Bs, sometimes Cs), but I cared most about understanding and comprehension of the language and its functions.\n\nHowever, I transferred from a community college to a very large 4 year in my state and am starting to slip quite a bit mentally. The lectures are massive and the idea of asking for help is to wait 24-48 hours for a TA to respond. It's not anyone's fault, but there's just so many of us. So, if I can't figure something out on my own that's sort of where progress halts. I don't really know what to do. Everyday I try again just keeps making that voice in my head that I'm not good enough for CS even more loud, and honestly, that destroys me inside. I think I may be hitting the point where how badly I want it doesn't outweigh how bad I think I am. Depression, probably. Lonely at this new place, also probably.  I don't really know what to do, it sounds dumb but it feels like a passion of mine is slowly dying. If you ever felt something like this what did you do?

Instead of that, I could take more stats classes to gain a better math background. At the same time, though, both of these paths would take away from the CS courses I'd otherwise take to become better at software engineering, another key component of being an ML engineer. My current issue, for example, is whether to take a CS elective like intro to AI, a stats class, or a data science programming or modeling class to fill out my course load. Ultimately, should I double major in stats, data science, or neither if I want to go to graduate school to pursue the ML engineer career path?

During my career, I had to grind LeetCode (LC) and other online judge platforms such as Hackerrank, Codesignal etc like many other. The biggest problem is: None of them were beginner friendly! Sure they may have 1 or 2 very elementary problems, but they jump their difficulty way too quickly and early. Sure LC is a great platform for experienced people, but still, it has it's flaws. Because of this, whenever people ask me about how to learn to code, I hesitant to direct them to LC or other sites.\n\nNext obvious thing would be to tell them watch bunch of 10 hour Youtube videos. But the thing about watching videos, is ... well.. you don't actually learn. You might feel like you're learning while watching the video, but by the time you're writing your code, you realize you didn't learn squat. This is obvious for so many reasons, but people tend to forget that we're practical learners mostly. Think about how you learned swimming, driving, or playing an instrument. What do those activities have in common? That's right, you put in hours of actual work by yourself. You don't watch people swimming or see tutorials on how to drive. You actually have to do it! Invest time and be patient.\n\nThat's why I started creating [https:\/\/pypup.com](https:\/\/pypup.com) This is only at alpha stage right now (soon to be beta) but basically it's another online judge platform like LC but it has structured learning with many repetitive tasks that gradually becomes harder. If you click on the into basics path ([https:\/\/pypup.com\/paths\/basics](https:\/\/pypup.com\/paths\/basics)) you would see more than 30 problems now just for the basic stuff like printing, variable declaration, simple if else problems. Think about how you learned math in school. You would learn about one topic and solve many problems on that topic. This is the same idea. I'm putting lots of easy problems for people to solve and the Solution tab is specifically designed for that problem level. I tried to explain thoroughly on the solution as much as i can. No such solution like LC where all the things are optimized to the fullest and have bunch of shortcuts in and 1 liners in Python.\n\nThe site has over 76 problems right now and supports only Python. I might add javascript later on but now focused on Python. More and more problems are being added daily. I only started this project 2 months ago and I really believe it could help people who are aiming to learn coding, or even help people who knows the basics, on certain topics such as Recursion, Dynamic programming, Linked List, Graph etc. Right now Recursion path \\[[https:\/\/pypup.com\/paths\/recursion](https:\/\/pypup.com\/paths\/recursion)\\] has over 17 problems, people who know coding, I would encourage you to check it out! I know I struggled a lot with DP and Graph personally so I would have loved to have this platform back in the day to learn things step by step and solving many easy problems to grasp the many of the concepts. \n\nI'll also be adding video solutions on each of the problem so stay tuned.\n\nPlease let me know what you think. You can join the discord which is at the bottom right of the site to give me feedback!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Created LeetCode like site called [pypup.com](https:\/\/pypup.com) to provide focused, gradual, repetitive, practical code learning platform and asking for feedback.\n\nThanks, Tsenguun","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677368419.0},{"title":"Personal project suggestions (for backend)","author":"fakeArushB","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11csjz9\/personal_project_suggestions_for_backend\/","text":"Hey all.

In my first interview ever, after hours Leetcode and feeling prepared, I froze up the second I was asked an LC-easy problem. This didn't stop - on phone screens or zoom interviews, I found myself underperforming even though I knew I could solve the problem afterwards. Even in interviews in which I \"solved the problem\", I was met with rejections without much feedback.\n\nI took a step back and realized that grinding leetcode was only the start. So I made a technical interview playbook for myself after collecting insights from every resource I could. It was by no means a script that I could follow robotically, but rather a mental model of checkpoints that I kept in my head to give myself confidence to ensure smooth interviews. It's a collection of what I think are best practices during interviews to proficiently highlight the four skills on which I was getting evaluated on:\n\n1. Problem solving\n2. Coding\n3. Debugging\n4. Communication\n\nEveryone has a different approach when it comes to interview strategy, so this is only what worked for me - but, it's been helpful to my friends who've asked me for help on interviews previously.\n\nThere are a million resources on learning to code solutions to DS&Algo problems, so I won't reinvent the wheel on that topic. Instead, I hope to provide at least a template of a playbook you could create for yourself with concrete steps to make sure that your problem solving prep can shine through to the interviewers.\n\nIf you prefer to consume the same info using visuals & audio or follow along with a video, here's a link: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/V0kT9mLYPa0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/V0kT9mLYPa0)\n\n## 1. Clarifying questions\n\nKinda clich\u00e9, but as a software engineer, you need to start solving problems with the right assumptions. Asking clarifying questions is doing that but at the scale of an interview.\n\n**How**\n\nWhen the interviewer gives you the problem, start by asking questions to fully understand what you\u2019re being asked to solve. For example, if they give you a problem on arrays, ask about the data types of the elements inside the array, sorted\/unsorted, or the min\/max size of the arrays. All these things will shape how you should approach the problem.\n\n**Why**\n\nEven if you think you\u2019ve solved the given problem before in a practice setting, it\u2019s in your best interest to make sure that you have all the right assumptions laid out, and that you clearly communicate to the interviewer your ability to spot out the details and embrace ambiguity with confidence and curiosity.\n\nAnd this is a great first step to invite the interviewer in to your thinking process. An immediate feedback I got from my mock interviews was that interviewers should leave the interview knowing whether or not they want to work with your or not. People prefer to work with colleagues who can get the job done AND communicate with them.\n\n## 2. Walk through different examples WITHOUT code\n\nMake it explicit that you're going to run through some examples.\n\n**How**\n\nEven if the interviewer does not provide a set of example inputs\/outputs, make sure to create some basic examples to confirm the expected behavior of your solution.\n\nCreate edge cases you can think of - for example, the weird corner cases of empty arrays, arrays with a million elements, or nulls and zeroes.\n\n**Why**\n\nThis heavily leans in to you signaling to the interviewer that you\u2019re extremely thorough; that you can test\/debug things and hypothesize expected outcomes even before coding.\n\nIt's also an opportunity to catch your own misunderstanding of the problem not in the middle of writing code on a white board, where you can so easily panic because you totally missed out on some important pieces of information.\n\nWalking through examples also brings the interviewer a step closer to you; you\u2019re really trying to maintain a nice communication channel throughout the entire interview.\n\nDoing all of this without an explicit solution in mind will prevent you from falling into traps or optimization paralysis while becoming malleable to different solutions and approaches.\n\n# 2.5 Feel free to take some time to think for yourself\n\nIt's ok, and encouraged, to explicitly ask for some time to gather your intuition for a few minutes. Take that time and shake-off the nervous jitters.\n\n# If you feel stuck...\n\n**Speak out loud and don't sit in silence**. If you can't wrap your head around a certain part of the problem and the intuition isn't coming to you, let the interviewer know what you're stuck with: \n\n\"I'm struggling to figure out how I can ...\"  \n\"I've got this part down, but I'm not sure how to best proceed with this other part.\"\n\nThey might give you a hint (which is better than just being stuck) or give you some pointers to help you move.\n\nAlso - if you're really really stuck and you can't come up with anything, that's ok. Start the intuition step by creating \"brute force\" solutions. That way, you'll have started solving the problem at least rather than not having anything on the board.\n\n## 3. Outline your solution\n\n**How**\n\nI personally like to use pseudocode at this stage to outline my solution because it\u2019s a lot easier for the interviewer to understand clearly what I\u2019m doing.\n\nFor example, say the problem is to return the index of a target element in an unsorted array;\n\nfunction FIND(target, array):  \n  \\# for index in array:  \n\\# check if target == array\\[index\\] -> return index if so  \n  \\# return -1 if not found after looping all the way through\n\nAfterwards, verify with the interviewer if it looks good.\n\n**Why**\n\nYou might be wondering, \u201cWell isn\u2019t it just better to use all of this time to just write the solution to solve the problem given that I only get 30 minutes?\u201d. Actually, I\u2019ve found that I save so much time by writing outlines and just filling in the gaps. It allows me to iterate on my solution quickly and catch easy mistakes I would have otherwise made - compare to having to reconstruct an entire code block from scratch.\n\nAlso you get to simplify and organize your solution, which makes it so easy for the interviewer to understand what you\u2019re doing. Having this organized skeleton of pseudcode makes it possible for you and the interviewer to be on the same page, and this can save your interview if you somehow missed a crucial piece of information.\n\nYou can also display proficiency in methodical problem solving and clean code by writing different helper functions too via pseudo code - huge brownie points.\n\nIt gives you an opportunity to mention if you think there\u2019re optimizations you can make to your solution. This way, you also saved time on not coding up a slower or a more spacious solution. You should directly ask your interviewer if you\u2019re good to start writing code to fill in your outline.\n\n## 4. Coding\n\n**How**\n\nYour outline should be enough for the interviewer to very clearly understand your solution. The way that I look at it, this should really be the easiest part, where it just comes to you naturally and automatically after all those hours prepping on Leetcode.\n\n## 5. Check your solution\n\n**How**\n\nBe extra proactive about testing and debugging. As soon as you finish your code implementation, you don\u2019t wanna let the interviewers prompt you to test your code. Do it immediately. Ask them, \u201chey is it alright if I run through some examples to make sure that I didn\u2019t forget anything.\u201d\n\nRun through the example inputs\/outputs you set up earlier through your code. And if you catch any mistakes, great, don't panic. You've just demonstrated the ability to debug your own code without the interviewer catching it themselves. Take your time to think through what the mistake is and fix it.\n\n**Why**\n\nIn software engineering, thorough testing prevents sevs and unexpected behaviors. By replicating this at the scale of an interview, you will look trustworthy and professional.\n\n## 6. Time\/Space complexity + further optimization\n\n**How**\n\nO(n) notation. Explain why you've come to that conclusion by walking through each piece of your code and how it contributes to the time\/complexity.\n\nFor example, \"Because we loop through an unsorted array at most once without altering the state of the array, the time complexity is O(n)\"\n\n**Why**\n\nWhen you work on problems at scale, saving resources (time\/compute\/storage) is the name of the game. This is an excellent opportunity to mention any optimizations you could make.\n\nFor everyone who made it to the end, something I cannot emphasize enough is to find a buddy or two to do **mock interviews** with. Practicing to communicate technical concepts to another person in the room is very different from typing away on Leetcode, and it will take you so so far. You\u2019ll get less and less nervous with more mock interviews under your belt.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677254336.0},{"title":"Fidelity Merrimack area summer internship roommate search","author":"BakerAppropriate1986","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/11bq0kw\/fidelity_merrimack_area_summer_internship\/","text":"Hey everyone,\nI am going to be interning as a fullstack engineer at fidelity in Merrimack, NH starting from June this summer of 2023.

Whilst I was studying in my 3rd year I managed to land a  full-time job as a Developer\/Programmer that doesn\u2019t pay bad but offers little to no employee benefits as I am not an employee for that company, just a contractor. As of right now I have 2.5 years of experience in Web Development (Backend and Frontend) in a stable Job with not a lot of vertical growth. My workplace a has a lot of tech debt that I can\u2019t really contribute much to fix since admins don\u2019t really like to contribute to that.\n\nI would like to have more benefits and have better pay than the offer I have now. In my current job I feel that I am an essential part of a small dev team. But unfortunately, in my country, all offers, postings and companies that I have either gotten job offers for, have gotten in contact with or can apply to; I consider to be either scamming the customer\/consumer, not really offering actual programming jobs (Employers that are confused on what programming means), not jobs that use up-to-date technology (such that if anything happens at that company and I need to bail, I would still have gotten valuable experience that is transferable along my life), morally corrupt, corrupt and or offer much less than what I earn right now. I would want a job that I can grow from and preferably be an employee not just on contract and not have to risk being laid off by a money hungry CEO.\n\nI am aware that in this day age and economy this might be tough ask, but I just want economic stability and WLB, not a lot of money but livable and reasonable pay for honest work. And not looking for a perfect workplace but a reasonable one that checks off some of my demands and treats me with respect. I have gotten offers offshore in continental USA but many don\u2019t offer much assistance when it comes to relocation costs and are a huge gamble when it comes to which team\/technology id be working on. In addition to the fact that at least for the offers I\u2019ve gotten they\u2019re based in either NYC, Maryland, Texas, California all of which have higher costs of living than where I am right now, and for an immigrant like me, I would have to eat up a lot of the costs of moving upfront. \n\nConsidering the state of the USA right now, I don\u2019t think I quite fit the bill for buying into the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d mentality. I struggle to justify gambling on a job offer considering the rising housing costs that most populous cities suffer from (most of which are the ones that need and have tech jobs). I have family, no kids but just a good relationship with my parents, girlfriend and friends. And leaving all of them just to gamble to see if I can strike in a fluctuating economy which could end up in my favor but also could end up horribly keeps me up at night. I have also considered immigrating elsewhere but, but I\u2019d have to get a work visa plus get past language barriers and still struggle with similar gambles; and since I am US citizen I don\u2019t need a visa to work in the US.\n\nI would like to see if people that have gone through similar situations have any advice on the state of my life right now. I haven\u2019t invested in assets to set my roots in Puerto Rico since since I am constantly unsure if I\u2019d stay for the next year. I don\u2019t hate it here, I don\u2019t love it here either but at least I can eat, live, laugh & love and afford niceties every now and then without worrying about needing roommates to pay rent and other undesirable tenets of modern late-capitalistic american life.\n\n\nTLDR: I want a morally justifiable job that respects its employees and can offer livable wage.

The text goes into detail about the concepts and how they all work but does nothing in the way of showing me how to actually work with and use them. Besides that, my professor's lectures leave much to be desired. She pretty much just runs through the chapters in the book as fast as possible so she can get back to grading assignments for other classes, each lecture being only about 15-20 minutes long, that is if we even have a lecture and not just a work day.  She's not a bad professor per se, she is very knowledgeable about Python and is always willing to help us with certain problems, but I wish she went a bit more in-depth. I know this is pretty much the common consensus regarding the majority of CS or other STEM professors but still. I really enjoyed my Intro to Python class and want to learn how to code, I've spent hours in front of the textbook and feel as if I have a decent grasp of the concepts, but the assignments are very complex and seem to rely on information that is not present in the book itself. Most of my classmates feel the same way and resort to using ChatGPT and other sites to get answers for the assignments. Even if we don't get the answers the professor pretty much just shows us the code for it anyways.\n\nI'm making good grades in the class and am currently set to pass it, but I feel as if I'm missing out on some core knowledge of CompSci in this class that I would otherwise need for my future career. Should I just say 'Fuck it' and cheese the whole thing? Or is there any sort of online resource I could use to help better understand this content? Most YouTube videos only cover the concepts, but it's the assignments with Arrays and Interfaces that make zero sense to me. All of the tools and functions we have to use to pass them are not explained or given in the text.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677089444.0},{"title":"Tech BDR looking at CS Masters","author":"zgreen17","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/csMajors\/comments\/119cmqj\/tech_bdr_looking_at_cs_masters\/","text":"I currently work at a global cybersecurity company as a business development rep (marketing\/sales) and I\u2019m looking to get a masters degree in CS with focus in IT, networking, or information security to become a better sales rep for my customers.\n\nUndergrad Majors: Economics and Mathematics \nGPA: 3.25\n\nI went to a highly ranked school in the northeast but I am looking to apply to programs in the NYC area.
