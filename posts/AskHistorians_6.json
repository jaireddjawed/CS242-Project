The first few books I read after that seemed to agree on that, but the older I’ve gotten, I don’t see that as part of his reasoning in any of the books or articles I’ve read the past couple of years. In fact, that doesn’t seem to be the case at all, that soldiers were not at all recalcitrant about following his orders.\n\nSo is there any truth that abdication came because Napoleon believed his soldiers would follow him better?",

The PVA (People's Volunteer Army) that fought in Korea was a distinct organization from the People's Liberation Army. This was done as a legal fiction to prevent China from being at war with the United States. The story most historians won't tell you is that the PVA largely consisted of former KMT armies. These were the armies that did not make it to the ports in time to be evacuated to Taiwan with the forces in the south, and either surrendered or reconciliated with the Communists. Since the major fighting with the Japanese was done up north, it was these lost KMT armies that were China's most blooded veterans at the time. They were considered politically suspect by Mao and he promptly threw them into the first foreign conflict available...\n\nI was just wondering if someone could verify, specifically the part where he talks about the PVA largely consisting of former KMT members. I understand that \"Peng Dehuai\", although he was fanatically for China, it seemed he was kind of all over the place when it came to loyalty to communism, but I'm wondering if this is the same for the regular troops of the PVA?",

        "text": "This excerpt is from the podcast \"The Rest is History\". Tom Holland here is an writer, no the famous actor.\n\nTom Holland : “On the broader level, Marx takes for granted that the oppression of the poor by the rich and the powerful is wrong. But he doesn’t want to say that this is a metaphysical position because that would lead him wandering into theological dimensions, into the dimensions of Christian thought, and so he claims that it is all entirely scientific, and materialist, and historicist. And so he sits in the British Library crunching the facts—lots of graphs, lots of tables—supposedly proving the inevitable fact that all History is class warfare, and that it is predestined that the wealthy will be overthrown, that a classless paradise will be established. It seems to me that essentially the whole pretense of Marxism to be scientific is a kind of attempt to deny its own Christian heritage, and indeed its Jewish heritage.\n\nDominic Sandbrook: “Marx often talks about being on the right side of history… science stands in for God. That’s Marxism’s dirty little secret: that it’s theology posing as science. I can remember when I was at university, meeting these people who, at the age of twenty with all their years of experience of the world, would say, ‘Oh I’m a Marxist!’ And I’d often say, ‘Well how do you know? How’ve you decided, at this age where we sort of know nothing? How do you know this is the blueprint that explains the world?” And of course it was a stupid question, because I thought it was a political position but it wasn't, it was a religious position. \n\nThis made me realized that Marxism does come across as some kind of religious prophecy: the workers will overthrow capitalism and establish a proletarian dictatorship/Christ will come a Second time. Do other Historians have any thoughts about this, did Marx try very hard to avoid religious connotations in his works?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/11oyz3b/to_what_extent_was_the_rise_of_fascism_in_europe/",
        "text": "For starters, I'm sure we've all heard the term \"fascism is capitalism in decay.\"  Essentially, from what I can tell, the basic implication from said phrase is that, supposedly, when private capitalists in control of various industries \"felt threatened\" by certain \"very-destabilizing/unstable economic conditions\" which, perhaps, they were afraid could well have \"led to socialist or leftist revolution that could dethrone us as a ruling class and/or eliminate capitalism altogether\", they 'banded together' to, essentially, support whoever, politically, they felt would \"bring down\" all of those 'threatening groups' to \"shore up\" their own capitalist power within the economy.  However...\n\nfor one, wasn't Mussolini a former socialist, and, based on some of his rhetoric and policies, didn't he and the Italian Fascists, as leaders of Italy beginning in the 1920s, \\*actually implement and put in place\\* a lot of \\*very-restrictive\\* regulations on 'how to manage and run the economy', esp. on capitalists and corporate elites themselves (though, perhaps, not necessarily ridding them of \\*all\\* their wealth and/or power\\*?  Also... I remember coming upon an article claiming that, among other things, at least one major historian likened old-school fascism of that time to, \"right-wing socialism\", funny enough.  Not to mention that, despite some \"lefties\" in countries like the US likening, say, corporate lobbies being \"too close\" to various politicians in our democracies as \"fascist\", the actual 'corporatism' Mussolini described was a much-more harmonious and controlled arrangement, per industry or 'societal grouping', formally managed by the gov't, in the end?  Not exactly 'the same' as \"private lobbyists for Citibank trying their damndest to bribe or 'buy' politicians with heavy campaign donations or doing their damndest to 'get more subsidies' while operating largely on their own nonetheless.\" And, finally, even in his Fascist days, I recall, if memory serves, Mussolini and his ilk, during their takeover of Italy, \"calling out\", to some degree, the \"greediest\" and/or \"most-powerful\" of the private capitalists enabled by previous capitalist practice and 'lax' economic policy?\n\nAs concerns Nazi Germany, in spite of them, perhaps, in the early days of their 1930s campaigns for office- esp. legislative office- being something of an \"intentional sham\" to \"win support\" for a \\*secret, very-odious agenda\\*, didn't the Nazis also take control of much of the Germany economy, vis-a-vis Weimar Republic?  Or, at least, were, if nothing else, heavily-interventionist within said economy?  I also recall hearing about a 'leftist' German economist who left Germany when things got too risky, who published a book called \"The Vampire State.\"  Supposedly he analyzed 'Nazi control' of the German economy \\*and\\*, to some degree, \"received complaints\" from even big-businessmen within Germany that, \"The Nazis are choking us\", so to speak?  This would seem to be, to some degree, to be \"a tad contrary\" to the idea that capitalists, in the early days, 'supported fascism to shore-up their own corporate power'?\n\nThen again, it's also true, if memory serves, that the modern term \"privatization\" \\*actually came from German practices\\* of that like, I believe?  Furthermore, insofar as they \"abandoned\" whatever \"socialist promises\" they 'made to the people' in the early years of their runs for power, did the bulk of Nazis (National Socialists) really \"have almost no intentions or ideals of doing anything remotely-close to socialism, let alone an expanded welfare state\", or is it simply the case that, thanks to high-level leaders like Hitler and \\*their\\* racialist-genocidal agendas, the party was 'steered in the wrong direction', so to speak, in a big way?  W/ those who were \"socialist or center-left\" being \"undermined\" in a lot of ways?\n\nAnd... to what extent did 'the capitalist class' \"actually fund and/or support\", in a MAJOR WAY, the early Nazis and Italian Fascists??  \\*Is\\* there hard evidence that early Nazi originators like Hitler \"got the bulk of support and/or funding\" \\*from\\* the capitalist class, or was more of their funding from semi-wealthy and/or middle-class folks who were, to some degree, more \"ultraconservative\" in values outside of purely-economic concerns?  Maybe this seems a bit \"naive\", but I'm having a hard time coming to terms with the notion that, \"Most of Hitler's and/or Mussolini's early supporters who helped them get into power in a big way were actual corporate execs and high-level managers worth a lot of money\"?  Is it more of a \\*combination\\* of wealthy support, to some degree, with 'ultraconservative' semi-wealthy and middle-class folks \\*also\\* supporting them, which helped them get to power?  Were most capitalists really as \"diehard traditionalist\" and/or reactionary, in those days, in both nations, as the implication would seem, or were they, in fact, only a tiny minority of actual supporters (the most-reactionary and/or traditionalist among said capitalists, that is)?\n\nOverall, what was \"the essence\" of fascism, economically?  Can we say, with confidence, that it was simply, \"fascism in decay\", per se, or is it a bit more complex?  Were policies of Italian Fascism and Nazi Germany simply \"so chaotic\", in terms of constantly changing, that there was a 'broad mix' of increased laxity \\*and\\* increased intervention, throughout various parts of said economies?  Did the capitalist class of both societies 'support' both parties simply to \"shore up\" their power, at large, or did only a fraction of each nation's capitalist support them (the most reactionary and authoritarian)?  If it's the latter, why are such \"rumors\" of \"mass capitalist support\" for fascism still spread so much (esp. within socialist and leftist circles online)?  And, finally... why would capitalists who weren't 'otherwise-very-reactionary' support such a \\*radical shift\\* in government and politics \\*as fascism\\*, just to \"shore up capitalism\" when... in countries like the US, for example, well into the 1800s and early 1900s, \"corporatist\" governments throughout the country were PERFECTLY WILLING AND ABLE to \"help the capitalists keep 'unfettered' capitalism intact\" for a long while (until 30s with Wagner Act)?  Why would Germany and/or Italy, in those days, feel like they \"need\" fascism, per se, to \"take down\" the communists, unions and the like?  Was the 'threat of full-scale revolution' really so much bigger in those days?  Wouldn't a heavily anti-union, anti-worker \"laissez-faire-esque\" Germany and/or Italy, politics-wise have \"done the job\" just fine, in terms of repressing worker and anti-corporate revolt?\n\nWas fascism, economically, simply a \"managed capitalism\" that various corporate leaders (and small businessmen, to some extent) in both nations felt was \"necessary for a while\" to \"keep threats at bay\" to their economic power (let alone capitalism as a whole), which they were willing to \"put up with a lot\" so long as workers got few-to-zero rights and such?  But... come to think of it, I recently came across info suggesting that, in fact, to some degree, in at least \\*some\\* German workplaces, there \\*was\\*, if nothing else, enterprise unions which may have \"campaigned fairly hard\" on \\*behalf of\\* workers in certain industries? ...which might seem to 'run contrary' to the notion that those corporate leaders \"accepted fascist control to put up with an interventionist arrangement to keep anti-corporate power and rebellion under control\"?\n\nMy apologies for the length of this post.  I initially wanted it to be a lot shorter, but... this is basically my \"internal thought process\", as of now, regarding the various \"contradictions\" within the 'public discourse' vs. \"what really went on\" wrt Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in terms of \"actual\" economic policy.  As you can see, the \"potential contradictions\" have been a lot for me to contend with, so I'm curious if any historian who manages to read the whole post (thank you) can come up with a cogent, not-too-complex answer in response?  To help me 'grasp more fully' how fascism, in the 20s, 30s and 40s, \"actually operated.\"",

Sure, in one or another country the more moderate forces push for one or the other, but it seems consistently to me that in most countries worldwide the far left and right are pushing for a diplomatic end to the war, usually calling for \"peace\", instead of support for Ukraine or Russia. Is there any precedence of this in history?\n\nAgain, i apologize to anyone taking offence by the way i contextualize it, but it's how i see it, and i'm just trying to follow rule 2 and make my question clear, and i've tried my best to leave morality out of it.",

This detail always struck me because I feel like it ruins an otherwise pretty cool design\n\nAlso, it seems like this was a common kind of tattoo in central Asia, [in this other example](https://www.britannica.com/art/tattoo) we can see the same deer as before, but also other animals in similar poses\n\nFinally one day I was reading about the Simorgh and I saw [this Sassanid plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sassanid_silver_plate_by_Nickmard_Khoey.jpg) and I was amazed at how similar it is to the tattoos\n\nSure, the animal in the plate is more like a dog, but there were different animals in the tattoos as well, and the fact that the posse is the same seems to indicate a connection\n\nDoes this mean that the Simorgh originated in central Asia? Was it originally a deer and overtime it morphed until it became a bird? Seems unlikely, but the designs in the tattoos and the plates are so similar...\n\nI don't know what to think, my brain is made to recognize patterns, and maybe I'm seeing a pattern where there isn't one",
