He's earning a lot, so there's no doubt he has access to material goods rather easily, but feels trapped because of the communist government and its restrictions.\n\nHow does China's level of social progression hold up?\n\nCan society be socially progressive if it only improves in one aspect, or does it require an all-rounded improvement in all social economic technological science fields of a society?\n\nAs you could already tell from my possibly uninformed elaboration or title, I'm someone who knows nothing about philosophy.",

What if, when AI becomes so strong and smart that we can literally transcend our human brain and computation. What if we could engineer an eternal (until heat death of course) sense of true happiness and contentment? Would it be worth it? \n\nI think it would if we could prove that the \"rewired brain\" is legitimately happier and more satisfied and content (choose good adjectives here). We would essentially be hardwiring the brain for happiness.\n\nOr maybe our sense of happiness doesnt even come CLOSE to the level of positive emotion that is out there. What if we could truly, and without the introspection of Himalayan monks, be happy with our situation and ultimate demise? Like truly happy?\n\nIt wouldnt be for everyone but the people who opt for it would certainly be \"winning\" in a sense.\n\nAnyways this thread is open to any discussion.",

        "text": "Discussing Crypto currencies or Electric cars for example, many people will assert that the government is incompetently flailing and that the technology is utterly unstoppable and anyone who chooses to block it rather than play nice is fighting a losing battle. People will even invoke the argument when it's about regulating Facebook or Google.\n\nIt's a bit of a \"politics vs. tech\" ideology battle.\n\nHowever, in the file-sharing space, we have absolutely incredible technology that makes the free-sharing of Music, Movies, and Scientific Papers absolutely trivial.\n\nIn theory, I could be reading the latest molecular biology paper, while listening to a very specific japanese ultradisc variant of The Wall, while watching a super rare thai-dub version of the special features of The Lion King. All for free, almost instantaneously.\n\nIn practice, though, special interests have completely gimped the potential of file-sharing services, and we are stuck with things like Spotify, Steam, and Netflix. Some of which boast limited selection, all of which charge fees, etc.\n\nPutting aside what is good and what is bad, is it not pretty clear that if the special-interest group is powerful enough, laws trump technology?",

        "text": "Anyone who has taken a 100-level Critical Thinking class at university (or any other debate/philsophy equivalent) will have learnt about logical fallacies in debates. One widely-known fallacy is the slippery slope i.e. \"If X happens, it will lead to Y and then Z\", with Y and Z assumed to be negative outcomes.\n\nI see this technique sometimes - most often in debates on moral issues - from people who are probably not particularly well educated in debating ideas or discussion, and I will roll my eyes sometimes. However I do sometimes see it taken seriously.\n\nFor example, when it comes to debating marriage equality: \"But if we legalise homosexual marriage, when will it stop? Why not legalise polygamy, or incest, or sex with animals?\" I see this opinion widely ridiculed all over the internet.\n\nHowever, when it comes to government surveillance: \"But if we just let government bodies see our e-mails, when will it stop? What is to stop them from checking our phone records, putting up surveillance cameras, and eliminating our privacy?\" While I probaly haven't done this argument justice, this is an argument that I commonly see on the internet, with pretty wide support.\n\nI don't know if these are the best examples, but I hope you get the gist of what I am saying. Basically my question is under what conditions is a slippery slope argument acceptable, and when is it a fallacy?",

I argued that there's a certain point up to where a man should know factual things surrounding the female reproductive system and birth control; and more-so depending on context. She argued that everything in the video is incredibly important and that all men should know this information. \n\nWe both agreed that SexEd classes throughout high school should be as detailed as possible regarding both the female reproductive system and birth control -- but then I stated that people tend not to store all the information that is learned from high school; such as technical terminology that isn't prevalent to someone's life. We also both agreed that a man should most definitely be aware of the primary function of birth control, and it's many side effects. \n\nRegarding the video, there's are a variety of questions asked. I argued that any adult should be aware of how prescription medicine works. A man should be aware of the menstrual cycle, but that specific terminology like IUD and Paragard IUD, and understanding how an \"implant\" works aren't as important -- as a man should only be aware of these things if it applies to his life through his partner. So what is your opinion regarding the question I stated, the points that were argued, and the video?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yjp7Q6iVx4",

        "text": "In recent months he’s turned into the stereotypical Trump bot, regurgitating Fox News talking points (“but Hillary!”, “Uranium One!”), while claiming anything outside of what he reads or watches is “Fake News”. Today he asked me whether or not I thought Fox News was more biased than ABC/NBC/CNN, to which I said “of course I do”.\n\nIts gotten to the point where intelligent, constructive political discourse is impossible because he either steers the conversation towards the bias of the media (except Fox, of course), how much of a “partisan hack” Robert Mueller is, or how the FBI should be arresting Hillary.\n\nIs there any way to convince him he’s metaphorically ‘drank the Kool-Aid’, or is this a lost cause?\n\nEDIT: ABC, NBC, and CNN are not where I personally get my news from. That was an objective statement made by him in general, not a personal comparison. ",
