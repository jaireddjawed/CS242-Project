I didn’t think this was too much of a big deal so I asked the person in charge of the calendar to remove the hold. They got back to me a bit confused so then I just more assertively said ti cancel the hold. This was 3 weeks away from the meeting so I didn’t think it would be that hard. I wait a few days and then realize I never got confirmation so I reached out to them again. Still no confirmation. Eventually I call the office 6 days later. The person who schedules wasn’t available but they wrote a note to the scheduler about my request. I’m still waiting and it’s we’re coming up on 12 days until the appointment time and it still hasn’t been cancelled yet and I’m getting worried. It’s a very important meeting and I don’t want to leave a bad impression on behalf of our company. I heard last week they were sick but am worried.",

I don't cry when I'm watching the titanic, or when someone dies, or when someone is sad because someone else dies. I don't intend to live my life shitting my pants because someone else is crying, but at the same time, empathy is essential for a functional society. I also feel as though I'm on thin ice. One day, someone could mess me up and I could just completely break and fuck up everyone around me. I've already slipped up a couple times. Ive thrown a stapler at my sister because of an argument. I've plotted to ruin the life of an ex friend of mine and succeeded(to be fair to myself, she did ruin mine). I've said some very suspicious things that everyone kinda laughs off because they think \"Shes so kind, shes just bluffing\" The worst part is I know I wouldn't care if I did.  Unfortunately, there's \nno way for me to get out of this hole. I laugh when everyone else laughs. I look sad when everyone else is sad(I still can't get myself to fake cry yet). I smile when everyone else smiles. However, as soon as everyone else turns their backs, I only feel the pain of smiling for too long. Emo, ik. I try to justify all of this by saying \"everyone around me is just uninteresting anyways\" or \"everyone around me is a douchebag too\" but I can't. It's too hard to not be a bad person but it's too hard to justify not being a bad person.",

The story started at the elevator, to let you know I have a phobia from any place that is closed or with a lot of people, the elevator was with 10 people that are our friends in the university, the elevator was beeping because the number was high everyone started to freak out but then a good friend of mine started jumping everyone was yelling at him telling him to stop but he was still laughing and jumping so I automatically took both of my hands and slapped him is his both cheeks.. He didn't even care at first he was still laughing and jumping and everyone is screaming.. But it was kinda harsh and a real slap from fear not even a joke.. Which is something I don't usually do.  I talked to him alone I explained the situation and apologized to him but that's what he said : I know you're having a bad day already so I am not mad at you but let's talk facts ( now his tone changed and he looked so tense)  you disrespected me in front of our friends and they will say how he would accept be treated that way and started yelling so I took him from his hand to that friends group I told them and him : you've seen what happened in the elevator I have a real phobia and he was acting funny but for what I did to him it was disrespectful and it did upset him and that's not how I usually treat him or anyone so am going to apologize to him in front of you all.. But then boom! Now he is angry and upset yelling at me and told me that now I made him really angry why would I do that and he started yelling and yelling.. Now I want you guys to tell me was it wrong? Was it bad my reaction and Apology? Did he overreact? Or what?",

        "text": "Hello all,  \n\n\nYears ago my mental health was at an all time low. I neglected school after I graduated high school, I had a dream which I was sure to reach with only the talent I had and not willing to work for it. The fact that I was diagnosed with a heart condition absolutely shattered that dream.  \nI basicly was a nobody with a low self esteem and nothing to show for in my life. I became addicted to video games which was the only thing I did from when I got up till I went to sleep.  \n\n\nIn these videogames, on the internet, I could become the person who I wanted to be so I started telling lies to feel good about myself. This made me neglect college even harder to the point where  I dropped out. At that point I was someone with no college/university diploma, no job, no ambitions and I hated every, single, thing about it. For me it was a circle I couldn't break in the real world which caused the virtual world to become more interesting.  \n\n\nDuring this sad time I managed to find a partner who made the situation worse. The relationship was very toxic. People to this day still tell me how bad the person in question treated me. On the other side I didn't feel like I deserved better. Why would I deserve better, I was nothing, useless. Who would even want to be with me other than this person, was the only thought I had during the relationship.  \n\n\nSo IRL I was just a sad man but in the virtual world I had it all. In one of the games I played I talked to people and although I told them all sorts of lies about myself to create a positive image towards strangers so I would feel better. Although I was in a relationship at that time I started talking to a girl in that specific game. Every time she was online I talked to her and to my surprise she talked back and liked talking to me. Because I had the idea I was not worth anyone's time I lied and lied to keep her to talk to me. Some things were true or had a fraction of the truth but basicly I lied to this person a lot.  \nThings escalated to the point where we exchanged numbers and we called/texted eachother daily. I actually fell hard for this woman but as you can see I managed to corner myself into a situation where nobody would win. I would never have a chance to be with this person because everything was based on lies AND I was in a relationship. Sometimes, some of the lies I told her would come out but I always found a way to turn it around and keep her interest. Untill the day my partner, at the time, found out.  \nInstead of owning up to my mistakes and start speaking the truth I told this really awesome person I didn't love her, I never did and it was all a joke. I choose to stay in the toxic relationship and tried to move on.  \n\n\nThe relationship ended cause it turned out the other person cheated and I was left alone. The karma of this all was more then deserved, which I'm well aware of.  \n\n\nAs you're reading this story and as I'm writing this I can't help but think that the person in this story is a real bad person. To be fair, I couldn't agree more. Everything I did makes me sick. Till this day it makes me sick. I think it's been 8 years, maybe more, and I still think about this girl regularly. \n\nWhy do I say that this is out of character? Well because it is. I have told this story to friends, people who know me very well and all they can say is that they would never saw this in me.\n\nAlthough it's out of character it's still something I carry with me forever. Something which will haunt me till the rest of my days and something I can't seem to let go. I thought writing it down, speaking about it, moving on with my life would make me forget what I did to this girl. But it doesn't.\n\nThe only thing it does is make me feel sad and sorry. The only thing it makes me feel is that I wished I was stronger back than and wouldn't drag somebody else into my sorrow excuse of a life at the time. Wasting this person's time, breaking her heart on multiple occasions and stomping on it repeatedly gives me a feeling I can't describe with words. I would spend a lifetime saying sorry to this person and it still wouldn't feel enough for me.\n\nTill this day I still feel like everything bad that happens is somthing I deserve for what I did. I wish I could let go and give everything a place to rest but I truelly believe that I don't deserve true happiness.  \n\n\nThanks all for letting me rant and I hope the story makes some sense.  \nFor people who do want to know I'm ok now but as I said I don't believe I ever will be as happy as I was talking to this girl back then.",

I was very stressed because even my school bills they blamed to me. \n\nBecause of this, I can't focus myself to study more because everyday was hell to me to live with our house. Because of money issues, I try to help them as long as I can in our small snack store when I got home after school but no payment because it's my parents business. but at the same time the other time is I work with coconut store for $1.82 everyday when I got more time left. And also i budget it to my meal everyday. In order to survive.\n\nBut sadly my mom stole all of my money I save with my job. I beg her to gave back all of my money because I need it to my school because the tuition bills is $637 every semester, additional with projects and activities. but she refuse and she needs money as she say. But in reality she just use it to her gambling addiction. My parents never help me with my financial needs at my school so I work hard for it but because I still college student, no job pay me better because they always need a college graduates. \n\nI was frustrated because that is the only thing I use to survive at my school and still live and help my family financially even they never appreciate my effort to help them.\n\nBut still because I love them. I still help them... But now because of my mom's doing... I'm very very frustrated and instead she gave back what she stole, she just angry at me and blame me everything what is happening to them.

I have been using TikTok for a while and recently found out that there are these thing on TikTok lives called “interactive Minecraft” where you donate TikTok coins to spawn something into the Minecraft world such as “money gun” 199 coins which costs $1.99 will spawn in a wither boss. My ADHD brain goes spend money=laugh laugh=good, good=spend money and so repeat. I have been saving up for a new tattoo and my wife’s actual wedding ring (I received her mothers ring like in crazy rich Asians the movie to give to her and I want to get her an actual ring for our 2nd anniversary) I finally came out to tell my wife I’m noticing this problem and she is curious so eventually I fold and do the math. I spent roughly $820 and when I told her I know she’s disappointed but she understands how my brain works so she’s trying to work with me to do better. I’m more angry at myself than anything else I was telling her how well I was saving my money finally with about 1000 in my savings and finally going forward with paying off my credit card but between the IRS taking a 1000 and my poor choice I have 300 in saving I’m negative on my credit card again (which I haven’t been in years) and like 100 bucks in my checking. I’ll recover from this it’s just I feel like a failure sometimes cause I go into a “ADHD HAPPY TRANCE” and won’t snap out of it till my brain randomly goes “HEY STOP WHAT ARE YOU DOING”.

        "text": "About 12 years ago I got a facebook message from someone I hadn't spoken to in several years.  We were in a weird/culty youth group together as teens but that was old news and we're both out now.  They wanted to catch up.\n\nGreat!  I went to their place later that week and spent an evening drinking beers, catching up, joking around and playing video games.  I had about 5 beers over the course of about 5 hours and drove home (unwise).  But it was a great time!  I made it home ok, and a few days later opened up facebook to see if they wanted to hang out again.  \n\nI couldn't find them on fb.  Anywhere. After looking around it a bit and thinking, I realized that I'd been blocked.  \n\nYou see: My friend had lost a significant amount of mobility due to being in a very bad, 100% **not** their fault, collision with a drunk guy.\n\nSo, quite understandably, they don't want to be friends with someone who would do something like that...  I mean, right in front of them???\n\n I never got an explanation or heard from them again firsthand.  I certainly don't want to bother them just to learn the obvious.\n\nIf it's done anything, it's forced me to come to terms with how genuinely unintelligent, thoughtless and horrible I can be. \n\n It turns my stomach to this day when I think about what I did.\n\nMiss ya buddy, sorry.",

        "text": "Hey all, I'm typing this on my phone while I sit at a bar. Go figure. Classic vet with issues at a bar in the morning. Anyways, I want to share my story about my service and why you should never join the Military.\n\nTo give some backstory, I didn't have the best childhood. Dad was an alcoholic, mom had to travel a lot for work. This led to me taking care of my little sister a lot. Many nights of baked chicken tenders and fries. The thought of them now make me sick. Lots of time with relatives and with my god parents. My parents and I have patched things up since then, but it wasn't good for a while. When in high school I got into drugs to silence my mind. Too many intrusive thoughts. Got clean for a bit and was a cook for a while. Eventually a sous chef at a couple nice restaurants. The problem was, I was homeless at that time. Lliving in my car. Same old routine every day. Wake up at 5, got to the laundromat and wash my clothes. Go to work. Make some shit pay and work for 16 hours a day. Sleep in my backseat at the gas station. Rinse, repeat.\n\nEventually I decided that I could be more than that. I went to a recruiting office. Initially the marines wanted me. Got me sucked into their \"were a brotherhood\" mindset. Funnily enough, when I got a 89 on my ASVAB the Navy recruiters came to basically steal me from the jarheads. They tried to make me into a nuclear engineer but I kept missing the test by a couple points. My recruiters tried to help me where they could. Give me some food or some clothes when I'd go to see them before shifts. A year later I was about to go to boot camp. My parents came to see me off. It was a sad moment. Mom gave me a hug and cried. Dad gave me a hug and shook my hand. Off I went.\n\nBoot camp is a blur. All I really remember is I did pretty well. Kept my nose clean. Got tasked with training the other recruits at night to keep their test scores up. Some of our RDCs really liked to pick on me though. Guess cause I was trying to do everything right. Should've been a sign in some way but I chose to keep up the pace. Boot camp ended and I went to Florida for training. \n\nFlorida was alright. Drank now and then. After chipping my tooth on a salad, I became very acquainted with take out food. Jimmy John's was my best friend for a while. At the end of my school I came top of my class. Got a spot promotion from E2 to E4 once I got to my destination command. \n\nFirst day in Virginia I met my Chief. He was loud. Special warfare guy for most of his career. Bigger dude. Liked to cuss. Had a temper. Come to find out over the years, the temper went deeper than anyone I worked with could've ever thought. The first year, things were alright. It was downhill after that.\n\nI noticed over time that Chief could flip on a dime. Obvious sign of PTSD, but we all paid for it anyways. Try to do something right and you're getting screamed at. You're getting hit. You're getting cornered. Fight or flight every other day. He was a menace. A tyrant. He'd make your life hell cause you looked at him wrong or made a joke he didn't like. \n\nOne fateful night in the second year of my career, a girl I was good friends with (went to boot camp together, Florida together) died from a drug overdose. I had hung out with her not even a week before. Couldn't believe it. None of us could. Good ol' Chief gave some good advice though (/s). He said \"what the fuck do you care if some whore dies\". I wasn't good after that. I tried to take some leave for the funeral but he made sure it was declined because I was \"being a pussy\".\n\nI moved forward. Beer never leaving my hand after work but I moved forward. Tried to cope. Chief got worse. Now our Divisional Officer was his best friend so it was basically having two versions of Chief going around. Man oh man, did they love ganging up on people. They would bully me relentlessly. Take me into locked rooms and threaten me. Shove, hit, degrade, rinse, repeat. \n\nThe only people keeping me afloat were the E6 in my shop. I won't say names for their sake but I still consider them brothers and best friends. They tried to defend me. Tried to defend themselves. Didn't always work. But they kept me together. For a time being.\n\nSomeone I worked with tried to kill themselves a little before COVID hit. Really fucked me up. The guy was a vindictive, snakey bastard. I didn't like him, but I didn't want him to die. He was in the psych ward for a long time after that. People on the ship only asked me how I was for about a month. Then nobody gave a shit anymore. \"Toughen up, you're fine\".\n\nChief continued trying to make my life hell. I wouldn't be surprised if his goal was to make everyone suicidal. During COVID he was one of the people to say \"it's just a flu\" and make my sailors work. That wasn't authorized. He didn't care. Do it or pay the consequences. Half my sailors got COVID and when they did they were all \"pussies\". \n\nAbout a year into COVID my perspective changed for the worst. A good friend of mine on the Ship killed themselves. I'll spare the details. It wasn't good. It was handled poorly. All the Chiefs pretended to give a shit about mental health for about two weeks. It was obvious, and paper thin. My Chief made it worse. He told me \"if you're gonna kill yourself you should just fucking do it\". This is when I spiraled. I went home that day and gave myself alcohol poisoning. Eight shots of whiskey and ten beers later im crying into my girlfriends stomach for three hours. Now I officially hate my life. \n\nI tried to get help but the military mental health resources are scarce and low quality. I chose the booze. Getting drunk to turn my brain off. It worked, even if only for a little bit. Had a couple times where I almost ended it all. My angel on my shoulder prevailed. \n\nClosing in on the end of my tour, I made it to E6 in five years. I'm proud. I survived. But I broke. I started sleepwalking, never did before. I'm jumpy. I'm numb. Disassociated.\n\nI'm exhausted of my family telling me that the civilian world isn't any different. They can't understand what I went through. They never will. Friends never will. I guess that's why victims of trauma stick together. They would tell me \"well I don't like my boss either\". No shit. Who does? But you can leave. If I leave I'm a felon. Trapped like a rat. Duty every 3 days (24h shift). It broke me to my core. I am so thankful I picked up the bottle instead of the gun. Id rather have a hard time putting the bottle down.\n\nNow the tour is over. I have a job. I still have my girlfriend and we will get engaged soon. There is light at the end of my tunnel. The military has scarred me so severely that I don't think ill ever be the same. With PTSD you can feel your mind start to unravel before the tailspin. Im trying to get disability but it is a process.\n\nI beg all of you who read this - don't let your loved ones join the Military unless they have no other choice. I did great in the Military, and it was better than being homeless. But at what cost? The cost of my soul? My self respect? My mental health? My homicidal rage that I've earned for my Chief? \n\nAs of today, I'm talking with VA to try to get disability for all this. I'm trying to drink less. Trying to talk to my friends more. Trying to open up more. Sure I am \"Thankful\" for the experience I have- but if I could go back in time I'd get it any other way. I hate that I put myself through this. My heart breaks for every young person who joins the Military. I'm sorry. \n\nDon't join the Military. Please.",
