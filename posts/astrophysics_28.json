        "text": "Don't know the double slit test? (Yeah right, geek) Go [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfPeprQ7oGc)\n\nIn it, a photon targeting photo film through a double slit creates an interference pattern when left unobserved during the process. However, if one attempts to observe/detect the photon traveling through both slits, it only travels through one, leaving 2 standard lines. The typical take from this is that quantum uncertainty breaks down because the process was observed, forcing a choice to be made. However, there's no reason that photons must be the only particle exhibits this uncertain state, and I believe we're getting a glimpse of that here.\n\nThe reason quantum uncertainty cannot be observed at laboratory scales is because the time scales would allow us to violate causality, and the universe doesn't allow for that. If \"dark matter\" is a form of Boson-like material, which it definitely seems to act like, it would make sense that it could gravitationally interfere with itself in multiple galaxy collisions. The key being that nothing had the opportunity to stop or alter these interactions, but each interaction had multiple spacial outcomes with equivalent probabilities. \"Observation\" actually just denotes a probability of interference, and the different ultra-massive pulls from various galaxies would create the uncertain path (double slit), as all mass centers involved would have multiple possible paths ahead of them. Since we had no ability to stop it when it happened, we get the pleasure of watching it now.\n\nGravity, as I see it, is the inversion and/or scattering of particle uncertainty when highly interacting particles clump together. Physicists would say that any object still maintains the possibility that it could fly part at the electron shell level (theoretically) at any moment. Think if it as a massive object's footprint spreading forward into time. Less massive objects (like you and I) near the surface of the larger simply become statistics in the largest worst-scenario desegregation, and the probabilities of where we end up are much less complex than the massive core of a planet.\n\nThe smaller, brighter masses of the continuing galactic parts of collision mentioned in the article were likely sling-shotted through because of the massive gravitational pull of the early dark matter interference, which likely significantly subsided in strength as the dark matter uncertainty was reigned in by the pull of the gravity of the normal matter. Why? Since normal matter can interact with so many more particles/forces, It's level of uncertainty is reduced by the number of nearby particles which could interfere with it. Therefore, it's gravitational footprint would remain relatively static and condensed. This would cause the dark matter (by this time lumped as observed above) to be pulled like a jetstream as the densely certain mass imposed just a bit more certainty on the dark matter around it, reducing the net gravitational pull.\n\nTL;DR; I propose that Dark Matter's low rate of interaction gives rise to gravitational interference. As an echo of quantum uncertainty, it gives rise to large fluctuations in gravitational fields acting on normal matter. Normal matter counteracts this gravitational interference through via higher levels of certainty imposing on dark matter. Uncertainty seems to be a property of particles most purely interacting with forces. ",

I've tried to find similar thought experiments, but haven't been able to find one that captures all the elements here.\n\n**Experiment**: There are two people \"Walking Willy\" and \"Rocket Randy\". Willy walks everywhere at a constant speed (7 kmh), and Randy has a rocket that can fly at 0.9c (90% speed of light). The second element here is that they each live on one of two identical planets (mass &amp; size), which can be seen from the other at all times. This also helps to negate the effects of General Relativity from this experiment.\n\nRandy gets in his rocket, and orbits his planet at 0.9c, while Willy circumnavigates his planet on foot at the same time (in the same direction). During their journeys, the other is always visible.\n\nWith the laws of Special Relativity (Lorentz transformation) in play here, how would one's orbit look to the other?",

        "text": "It was a pretty popular talk at the University of Calgary, so I didn't get a chance to ask my questions directly. However, I expect some people here can help me out! I am also a total layperson, so hopefully these questions make sense?\n\n1. The Big Bang implies that we could theoretically locate, in our 3-dimensional space, the starting point of the universe. If everything has been moving away from that point for 13.X billion years, doesn't that mean there is a massive void back there now? That is, shouldn't the universe be shaped sort of like a tennis ball, with most matter in this \"band\" moving outward, and a big void in the middle? If not, why not?\n\n2. I understand that from any galaxy it appears that other galaxies in any direction are moving away from it, and the further away they are, the faster they are moving away. But shouldn't it be true that when you look out toward the leading edge of the universe (as opposed to the starting point), those galaxies should be moving away at least a tiny bit faster? Because they're further away from the center of gravity of the universe, there should be less force pulling on them. Also, things should be a little bit \"less dense\" out in that direction, no? Why can't we detect this?\n\n3. The background radiation thing. So this is the \"faint echo of the Big Bang\". I get that, but at the same time I don't get it. If we consider a particular energy particle(?) we measure, and assume it was emited during the birth of the universe... what has is been doing the past 13.X billion years? Shouldn't that energy have been traveling **away** from the point of origin? And at the speed of light, which is faster than we've been moving to get where we are now. Has that energy sort of been bouncing off the leading edge of the universe forever or something? I dunno, this one confuses me a lot.\n\nI appreciate and explanations (especially analogies!) that help me to wrap my around these ideas. Thanks!",

        "text": "Okay, I understand this may be a frequently asked question, but I was having troubles finding the answer on here. I have been doing some reading on the duality between black and white holes, and I was having a bit of trouble making sense of it. I sadly am a lowly fluid dynamicist, so quite humble when I am trying to entertain these topics. \n\nWhile I realize that black holes only have a size due to the relative diameter of their 'Event Horizon', much about the singularity still peaks my curiosity. The main thought that has persisted in my head is to follow a speck of mass into the hole. At a certain point the shear amount of forces will elongate it, and eventually will break it down into energy. But if you follow that spec to the singularity, time will begin to move arbitrarily slow, at least by our modest comprehension. Suppose you stuck with this speck for an amount of time that was arbitrarily close to infinite.\n\nCan our current understanding and equations depict this re expanding after it nears a finite but incomprehensibly distant point in the future? If so, could this perhaps explain the Big Bang, where there was only blackness, due to the passing of so much time?\n\nI realize that 11 dimensional hyperspace and string theory lend themselves towards this, but does this require the extra dimensional stand-point to equate? In the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker big bang equations, black holes are seen as an end point singularity, but could this be seen as a cyclical input to the big bang's singularity? And, if so, could this mean that the 'wormhole' concept is just the progression through an arbitrarily slow point of space time, leading to the funnel like diagrams that attempt to depict it?

In fact, after such a deliberate infection event some might catch on and spread really fact. What after five years of deliberate contamination Mars would develop a subtle greenish hue along the equator?\n\nSo... what if someone infected Mars in this way. Someone unaccountable to national laws. Would this be a crime? Who could enforce a penalty? The UN? \n\nMy guess is that if a private contractor would do this nothing would happen. A lot of people would whine and bitch, but no one would be held accountable. There simply aren't any laws to cover this.\n\nWhich basicly is the same as saying - *it's legal*. \n\nThe Russians could do this. They could literally go unilateral and try and colonize Mars with simple terrestrial life. The spores would probably die. But some might survive, right? That life could be there, hundreds of millions of years in the future, even if Earth would have become a sterile cinder by then.

It's literally the only passion I have.\n\nThe predicament is that I can't afford college right now, I did horrible in High School (mostly just because I hung with the wrong crowd and was a bit of a bitch.) and.. I'm absolutely terrible at math. Even simple Algebra.\n\nSo I've been starting from the very beginning at Khan Academy and it's been helpful so far, so hopefully I can start understanding the math part of it all someday.\n\nMy question is, starting all of this at 27 is really discouraging for me. I know that anything is possible, but is it even more difficult for older folks to get into the field? When I can afford a good university and get my degrees, I will be well into my 30's.\n\nI know it's never too late, but is it going to be much harder for me at my age? Are some people just not cut out for this sort of thing?\n\nI don't want to give up on my dreams, but the older I get, the further it seems from my grasp.\n\nSorry if this is the wrong place to post.
