        "text": "A modern day ghost story\n\nBill was on the side of the road hitch-hiking on a very DARK NIGHT and in the midst of a FIERCE rain storm.\n\nThe night was rolling on, and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few meters ahead of him.\n\nSuddenly through the swirling rain Bill saw a car slowly coming towards him.  And as it drew level with him, it stopped.\n\nDesperate for shelter and without really thinking about what he was doing, Bill got into the back seat of the car and closed the door.  That was when he realized there was nobody behind the wheel and the engine wasn't even on!\n\nMysteriously and soundlessly, the car started moving slowly forward. Bill looked at the road and saw a curve approaching.  Now he was scared, and he began to fear for his life.  But just before he reached the curve, a ghostly hand appeared through the window of the car, and turned the steering wheel.\n\nBill, paralysed with terror, watched how the hand appeared every time they came to a curve.\n\nWhen he saw the lights of a pub down the road, Bill gathered all his bravery and strength, jumped out of the car, and ran to to the pub.\n\nWet and out of breath, he rushed inside and asked for two shots of scotch.  Shaking and half crying, he began telling everybody about the horrible experience he had just been through.  A silence enveloped everybody when they realized he was not drunk, but was for real.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, two guys walked into the same pub. They were also wet, and were out of breath. Looking around and seeing Bill sobbing at the bar, one said to the other, \"Hey Bruce… that's the idiot who got in the car while we were pushing it.\"",
