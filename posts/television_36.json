I think with the 42 minutes without commercials keeps the show from diving two deeply into its \"accused of the week\" and this feels like the type of storytelling format that would've been better served on premium cable or a streaming service. Anyone else kind of feel this way on the show?",

And things didn't make sense *Spolier* ( such as Sophia feeling guilty over killing the humans and having a dream about it but still was going to go through with it anyway. I didn't buy her tug of  conscience, the president and the government felt so out of power i couldn't even take them seriously)\n\nThe Crossing - was so good. It had great pacing and action. Really wish it had a season 2. \n\nPersons unknow - it was good overall. I do feel like some things made no sense ( like them eating away but the organization being so powerful they found them right back again)and I dont think a season 2 would've been good. \n\nUnder the dome- Big jim was the worst but I also feel like without his character it wouldn't have been as interesting. Can't see what another season would be like though. I feel they took too long to get to where the series ended. I also feel it was kind of a let down .\n\n\nAlso any other recommendations would be great.  I love overarching mysterious and scifi. I am watching the invasion (2005)",

        "text": "I recently started binging this show on HBO Max. I vaguely remember watching reruns of this show back in the day, here's a few things I remembered as a kid about the show:\n\nTakes places in a NY public HS, the guy from *WKRP* is the teacher, who was eventually replaced by some Scottish dude; There was a nerd &amp; fat kid who sat in the back of the class, on a computer; a tough kid with a leather jacket &amp; NY accent; A soft-spoken redhead, played by an actress with an exotic looking name; Robin Givens was in it (only actress whose name I knew because she was married to Mike Tyson); a guy named Aristotle, who I thought I imagined until season 4's soft reboot (more on that later)\n\nI feel like *HotC* did a good job of pioneering diversity on TV, and was very progressive for its time with its subject matter, which I can appreciate watching as an adult, not so much as a kid. Mr. Moore was great at imparting words of wisdom on the kids like a father figure. I really wish he stuck around and married Ms. Meara in the finale.\n\nNow on to season 4...\n\nThree characters were written out for whatever reason (sad to see my crush Leslie Bega gone) and  it feels like a *Saved by the Bell* clone, especially after that museum episode early in season 4. Mr. Moore feels like a background character now. Is it even worth watching anymore? I'm not one to hate-watch a show if it gets bad, even if it's near the end. I've been stuck on season 4 for a while, after binging the first 3. Does it get better? I really loved the first 3 seasons, so much that I never skipped the show's intro. That harpsichord-synth duet with footage of old school NY was the shit.\n\nRIP Howard Hesseman",

        "text": "In the public transportation which is essential for daily travel, mostly underground and bus, people are mainly divided into two categories when travelling in urban areas. This essay will focus on the connection between safety facilities and people's composition in space when standing on public transportation, as well as a brief analysis of the differences in transportation facilities between different countries. On the underground during rush hour in London, particularly from Bank Station to Oxford Circus Station, it can seem as if there are crowds of people at any given time, and the handrails in the carriages seem out of reach in the crowded gaps between people, who are forced to become railings for each other as the underground moves. There are significant variations in the design of public transport between China and the UK from my point of view. For example, the handrail loops in China's metro are replaced by railings in London, the position of the railings is also completely different, and most stations in London have displays indicating the arrival times of buses, etc. In the Chinese metro, an additional loop is added above each seat for the stability and comfort of the standing person at peak times, and more importantly for the safety and practicality of a wide range of people of different heights, as the general level of the metro rail is around 1.9m above the ground, and therefore according to the data it is not suitable for people under 1.65m to hold. The height of the loops has been calculated to meet the requirements of most adults, so that people can hold the loops at the most comfortable height for their arms. The vertical handrail is further designed to provide a secure grip for people under 6'5\". The distribution of the three types of handrail in the carriage also reflects the designers' research into the psychology of human beings, for example, the doors are usually not set up with rings in order to reduce congestion, and the distance between the vertical bars in the carriage is designed to be more humane. After observation and research, from my perspective, it is difficult to decide on the material of the handrail rings in the carriages, as most handrail rings today are easily damaged and cost more to maintain than the vertical and horizontal rails, but replacing them with stronger materials would be a safety hazard for taller people, and the handrail rings give a visually messy and chaotic feeling, even if some children play and swing on the underground's handrail rings. Therefore, I think that in the future development and construction of technology and intelligence, it would be more humane to design the handrail ring as a hidden automatic device, which can be stored on the top of the carriage and can be adjusted to different lengths and positions according to the needs of people of different heights.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kcxi03rmnrfa1.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6025250cb8ef7ed8032dcb17db458c0fd75a0cb8",

        "text": "The wonderful mods at /r/Netflix saw fit to ban me for this 100% legal workaround for the Netflix password sharing ridiculousness. I want to spread awareness of this solution, and encourage everyone here to do so as well. Power to the people!!!!\n\nCaveat: The solution requires some technical work and is suitable for the moderately tech savvy (or those willing to do a little research and learning). \n\nSo, as I understand Netflix will require mobile/portable devices to log on via a wifi connection and watch *something* at least once a month or so for the primary location associated with the respective Netflix account. This will authorise the device to watch something remotely (for 30 days?). Please feel free to point out if I’ve got this wrong. \n\nIf I understood the problem correctly, the simple workaround for this is to setup an inbound VPN connection to your home, and then you should be able to connect to your home network with your device via the vpn connection and then watch *something* for a bit to reauthorise the device for 30 days. From Netflix’s perspective all they will see is the device accessing Netflix from your home IP address. \n\nAs you will be routing all of your internet traffic via your home internet connection, you will probably only want to stream while connected to your home vpn server for a little bit as you will be relying on your home upstream (upload/outgoing traffic) to receive the steam. This can cause pauses/performance issues - unless you have reasonable uploading bandwidth. \n \nI won’t go into the blow by blow of how to set up a vpn server, but I believe there are some reasonably straightforward ways of doing so using a little raspberry pi device or by setting a more full-featured router like PFSense (this is what I have at home). Unfortunately, you can’t configure vpn servers on most home routers, so additional cost/setup will be unavoidable for most. But I’m confident it will cost much less than an additional subscription over the medium/long term. \n\nIf Netflix requires you to only watch from authorised IP addresses (i.e from your home) in future, assuming your internet connection is fast enough, you can just do so while connected to your vpn without issue.",

        "text": "I want to preface this post by saying that I believe, when it comes to the TV/Movie genre of ‘bank heist/robbery’, the first two seasons of LCDP—the first heist— should be considered as one of the best made in recent memory. Everything about it was captivating and for the first time, I was pulling for the worst of bad guys like he was a good guy. It somehow mixes over-the-top, campy action with drama I didn’t know I wanted *taps veins* every episode. It was as ridiculous as it was thrilling, it was dramatic and humorous and left the viewer with an odd feeling of “I could do that…”\n\nJust like GoT, it absolutely enthralls you from the get go: Who is the Professor? Why are they hitting the Mint? Why is Berlin leading everything? What’s with the masks?!  You, the viewer, are suddenly along for a rollercoaster of a ride that has wondering “are they the baddies?”the entire time; all the while you are justifying which gang member is your “favorite”. In a matter of episodes: Denver and Berlin are relatable, each and every gang member has a reason to be there and the government is the bad guy. It’s not about the heist(seven kingdoms) anymore, it’s transcended to a nationwide movement against powers that be (Westeros v the wall)\n\nThen…as sudden as and deep as you fall for the characters, the plot, the reason behind it all…the rug gets swept from under your feet. What was once a gloriously made show turns to a fantastically funded, grind house action flick. What used to be Die Hard level of campy forgiveness turned to piss poor writing and plot holes that would give Swiss cheese a run for it’s money. \n\nUpon finishing LCDP, I was left with the same sour taste of disappointment that I had ignorantly denied tasting for a whole season with GoT. In the back of my head, I knew there was no rectifying the damage done to the amazing start but something kept me going, out of sheer hope maybe, that the show would come out on top again. \n\nLCDP had potential to be one of the best heist productions ever made and when I do re visit it again, much like GoT, I won’t go past a certain point; lest I get disappointed all over again",

What is interesting, is that it is being review bombed seemingly by non-US users, with 28.6% of users recording a 1 against 59.5% recording a 9 or better. \n\nInterested to hear peoples thoughts on this episode, and where they think the predominant source of review bombing for great pieces of television like this comes from.",
