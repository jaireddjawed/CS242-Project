It starts with a very limited vocabulary that repeats often and by the second chapter (there are 3 per volume) you really start moving as far as comprehension.  The story is by far the best that I have come across at this level of language. So far the author has 6 volumes released with more to come. The first volume is made available for free via browser on his website:  \n[https://crystalhuntersmanga.com/](https://crystalhuntersmanga.com/)  \nThe rest are in the kindle unlimited library if you like it. Please give this resource a look and spread the word to other people because as a new learner this has completely rekindled my interest in Japanese and I'm sure there are many out there like myself that will be so happy to have found this resource and be able to enjoy their first manga.",

Welcome to the wonderful rabbit hole of Japanese names (卓=suguru) and their kanji. 鴨 (kamo) means duck. Not sure if this alludes to anything.\n\nMore importantly is the final title \"dono\" which I translated with \"Mister\" (different from Mr.).\"Dono\" is different from what kanji, meaning \"lord\" implies. \"dono\" at the end of a name is very pejorative, like looking down on the person. Like a teacher looks down on a naughty student.\n\n歪んだ (yuganda) is the past form of 歪む (yugamu). 歪 is a Hyougai Kanji outside of the two official lists. Meaning to \"be distorted\", (even the kanji itself is made of two parts, \"not\" at the top and \"correct\" at the bottom). It's an important term throughout the game.\n\nクソ野郎 /クソさ: Kuso (kanji: 糞) means shit and is used in lots of different expressions, including Kusoyarou meaning \"shitty person\" or \"bastard\". Comically informal is the use of クソさ (kusosa) turning it into both an adjective and noun for \"shittyness\".\n\nことにした (Koto ni shita): part of the \"koto ni suru\" grammatical construction, i.e. to be decided, to decide on\n\n怪盗団 (kaitoudan): The Phantom Thieves, or literally, \"ghostly thief band\". all 1 word with 3 characters.\n\nより (yori): It's a special \"yori\" here, not the comparative one, used to say less than/more than. Rather here it is similar to \"kara\" meaning from.",

In contrast, in Japanese passing N5 almost meant nothing in terms of fluidity in speaking or thinking Japanese.\n\nWill this \"click\" in your experience ever happen in Japanese, or is it more like a slogging process where you are always struggling? If it happens, at what kind of level (N4, N3, etc)?\n\nMaybe knowing how far I am will make my goals more realistic.\n\nThanks a bunch,",

        "text": "Many people think that you need to know a lot of words to have other people understand you. But as it turns out, you can get by with only the most used ten hundred words.\n\nI'm not going to say that knowing more is bad. But if you already know ten hundred or so, you can still talk about a lot of stuff. Of course, this way of talking is helped by knowing simple ways that people talk to each other with.  I think that it's an important thing to know, the simple words that can be put together in ways that people out on the street actually use. You should spend a lot of time on these words and the ways that people put them together when they're talking with their friends. Something like \"I know, right?\" doesn't mean much if you think about it, but it actually has a very understood meaning. And of course, if you know how to say \"How do I say this word?\", you can learn more than ten hundred as you go.\n\nBut with ten hundred words, you can talk about things like school, and food, and work, and how you feel about other people, if you like them or love them or hate them. You can talk about games, and how to get around town. You can talk about your house and the stuff that's in it. You can talk about how you feel, if you're happy or sad or angry or tired. You can buy things and ask questions about the things before you buy them. You can actually probably live on ten hundred words, even if sometimes you sound a little weird.\n\nProbably the most important thing to go with your ten hundred words is knowing the words that go in between the \"words that are about things\", and those words are how you build the thing words into something that makes sense or adds more meaning to the thing words. Without those, it would be hard to make sense. So work on these building words and you'll be okay.\n\nSo don't feel bad if you only know ten hundred words. It's still enough to have other people understand you if you know how to say them and how to put them together.\n\nThis was made using only the ten hundred words that we use the most.",

For example, if I want to find fan opinions and views on a certain work (like manga, games, books, movies) in English, I can just search on reddit, twitter or YouTube and see a lot of fans posting their opinions. It's also easy to find discussions on general topics (such as news, politics, sports, history) by searching directly.\n\nI don't know if it is due to my Japanese is not good enough, but I find it hard to find a place where Japanese speakers express their real personal opinions about something by simply searching the name. I've tried Twitter, but if I search directly for the name of a work, all I find is official content, and the few personal opinions are very official and formal. I guess many people prefer to use code words and don't like to be searched by strangers? And I've heard that people are more likely to post their real opinions on anonymous forums? But I personally feel very confused and puzzled by anonymous forums.\n\n I'm hoping to find some general guides on how to search online for a Japanese internet community for a certain topic. But if generalizations are too difficult to give an opinion on, then I'm particularly interested in the following topics: Japanese video games, Japanese visual novels, Japanese visual art before the 20th century, 20th century Japanese history, classical Japanese literature (especially poetry), TV drama, contemporary global politics, and lgbt+ culture and lives in Japan.\n\n For any of these topics, is there a good online community where I can easily find people's opinions and reivews? thank you very much.",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I am currently trying to learn the language and have hit a rough roadblock already. I went through lesson 1 of the book. I decided I would try to work through the workbook for practice.   \n\n\nThe first practice is \"What are these people saying? Write in Japanese the appropriate expression for each situation\" It has some pictures and seemed very vague so I skipped past this.   \n\n\nThe next section was counting and was a bit tough because I didn't understand what to do past 10, but doing some looking up online, it seems you just put the numbers together. I got to one where the answer is 164 (found online), but I have no idea where the symbol came from   \nひゃく      ろく        じゅう      よん  \n  ???            6               ???            4  \n\n\nMy big concern is that I feel like I am already off to a terrible start and completely lost. Am I missing something or approaching this incorrectly? Any point in the right direction would be great. Thanks a ton!",

        "text": "I'd never used jpdb's srs or vocab lists, but I have used it's word counts to compare difficulties.\n\nI've been curious about its counting method, because I played the fate stay night vn and mined almost every word I didn't know, and I've also mined from a lot of other stuff, but I'm only at 11k cards while jpdb says that fate stay night has 21K words. Curious about the ten thousand ghost words, I imported my anki decks and took a look at what it said I was missing.\n\nA *TON* of it is stuff that I would consider as phrases, conjugations, collocations, or grammar . E.G:\n\n* までもない\n* なんです\n* ですから\n* どうせだから\n* してやる\n* でこぼこコンビ\n* あるらしい\n* こうする\n* になると\n* となれば\n* となると\n* からには\n* それはそれで\n* これぐらい\n* だからといって\n* いつのまに\n* そこから\n* バランスをとる\n* メガネをかける\n\nIt likes to count the non-kanji versions of words separately from their kanji versions, there were a lot of words in hiragana that I had already learned as kanji.\n\nThere were also a *TON* of katakana loan words that I felt were too obvious to bother with cards for.\n\n* パトロール\n* コマンド\n* コントローラー\n\nAdditionally there were katakana phrases. Even if I felt the need to learn their component parts I personally wouldn't learn these as combinations.\n\n* パーフェクトワールド\n* ラッキーナンバー\n\nThere are also a lot of slurs, contractions, and other distortions of words counted uniquely\n\n* すっごい\n* そりゃ\n* おっきい\n* あったかい\n* しょうがねえ\n* んまい\n\nSomewhat overlapping with the katakana words were proper nouns. There were a bunch of place names and the names of all of the heroes.\n\nThere also were genuine words that I chose not to mine for whatever reason, and complete misparses. \n\nI'm not necessarily saying this is a problem with jpdb, maybe it's your style to want to learn all of them as individual words, and if so I don't think there's a problem with that. If I learned all of these with flashcards, I'd be able to do far more flashcards in a day, so probably it will even out in the end. \n\nI'm mostly just saying, if you're like me and only make flashcards for things that seem significant, don't be too discouraged by jpdbs giant 21k \"words\" since their definition of \"word\" is pretty different. You don't need 21k flashcards to be able to understand fate.",

I heard it was like the 'Wanikani of Vocabulary.' I've made a lot of progress and great strides with Wanikani - it really works for me - so I thought hey, Bunpro will probably work pretty well too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich it does, but it also very much doesn't. The initial explanations of a new vocab item make sense - I think these parts are largely very well done - but the Reviews section always leaves me deeply frustrated. I kinda wish it was timed similar to Wanikani, especially since the Reviews can rack up quite quickly. I've been doing them and learning new vocab everyday for about two weeks now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore than that though, I think what gets me about the Reviews section is they'll teach you one thing in the Lessons, but then the Reviews section will have things that weren't \\*quite\\* covered in the initial Lesson, if that makes sense. Or at least they weren't covered very thoroughly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat said, I understand Bunpro has things like Cram and Reading practice. I do these, but they still don't feel like they help my reviews all that much. Also, I often feel like I'm studying for the test (the reviews), as opposed to learning anything for more general knowledge. The layout of the Reviews can be a bit jarring/confusing as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to be fair to Bunpro, I do still think it's useful in some ways, and clearly other people have had success with it. I think it just might not be for me, which is disappointing after hearing everyone talk about how amazing it is and how much they learned from it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess this post is also partially a vent, I won't lie, but I am genuinely curious if it didn't work for other people either?

I assume there are subtle little differences between all of them and when to use them that will naturally just get learned over time through experience, but \nwhat I am specifically asking is how to know when to make cards for these kinds of words and which to prioritize when I am looking to learn a particular English word in Japanese. If I am looking to learn the word \"receive\", do I just write down all of the top results in a dictionary, such as Jisho.org? I just feel as if that would be very overwhelming to do for every word...you know...every other time I want to learn a new word having to make 3 new cards for the one word. There must be some way to figure out which to study now and which to just study later, right?\n\nSince each word has its own unique kanji, I don't want to lump it all into one card...that'd be far too overwhelming to take in + again, they all have slightly different meanings but are all commonly used, so I don't view it as a very good idea.\n\nThis has been the #1 thing making me metaphorically pull my hair out for a while now that I can't quite seem to get.

        "text": "Once, early in my study, I found a book (Kanji pict-o-graphix by Michael Rowley) that tried to teach Kanji by breaking them down into beautifully-rendered pictures that represented and resembled their components, and telling mnemonic stories about these meaning elements and how they could be related to make the character’s meaning. \n\nAs much as I wanted to love it, I ultimately found this book to be unusable; while in many cases these symbols lined up with component meanings, all too often they were chosen more for visual resemblance, and I could never remember the stories anyway. Before too long I decided it was more hindrance than help.\n\nI think what this book did not give me was the **why**. For what reason are those particular components in this character? I found answers first in a resource called Genetic Kanji, and later in Uncle Hanzi’s site and the Outlier dictionary.\n\nUltimately, I’ve found that while mnemonics are next to useless for me, etymology sticks, and understanding the phonetics of compounds helps make it stick even better, since I can often pick out the phonetic component and use the meaning component as a hint.\n\nI really wish kanji had been taught to me this way from the very beginning; instead, my teachers all said “focus on the meaning and don’t worry about the 音-reading, you’ll just kind of pick those up later.” While they were kind of right about that coming automatically with time, I think I missed out for years on the valuable tool of understanding how kanji were constructed. When the reading is integral to the character, it’s just making things harder than they have to be to ignore it, right?\n\nI assume at least some other people feel this way due to for example the popularity of Outlier, but at the same time, I searched and didn’t see too many posts specifically about using etymology as, or in place of, a mnemonic, and most tools or books seem to be organized around mnemonics. I’m trying out jpdb.io right now and their mnemonics are driving me crazy due to things like conflating 日 and 曰, or 肉 and 月when used as components, or using “old grave” for the mnemonic of the top parts of 者 and 老, even though they have completely different origins. Am I just a weirdo who cares too much about structure and history? Do other people also come to dislike simplistic interpretations of kanji components and regret trying to use them to learn? Am I just doing mnemonics wrong?",

I've had short stints as a Japanese tutor privately as well as a tutor at my college previously. As many of you may relate with your native tongue, the thing I can't really do is explain *why* certain grammar functions are, just what's right or wrong, which is why I can't really fully teach Japanese. That's why I'm considering being a conversational tutor. \n\nSo my question is, if you are/were looking for a conversational tutor, would you be looking for someone who can fully explain to you grammar functions or more so someone who can help you with conversation only? \n\nIf you are/were a conversational tutor, I would love your insight as well.\n\nTIA :)",

Unless it's something I'm rewatching and the first watch was recent.\n\nIt's been this way for years now and idk how to surpass this \"level\".",

I only used books and YT videos to learn.\n\nNow I'm working around Japanese people and I get to speak and listen to them everyday, but since it is my first experience being with natives, I completely forgot most of the things I learned when speaking.\n\nI actually have no deep interest in Japanese language per say, it's just that the salary is really good in my country if you know the language.\n\nNow I'm aiming for N1, and I wanna know if the time frame is realistic in order to pass. I'm working most days and am only able to learn prolly 30 mins - 1 hour everyday. Although right now I do think working with Japanese people kinda helps in my listening and also reading a lot.\n\nI think I want to start reading Japanese stuff that is not just JLPT books. Any fun books that is not anime you guys can recommend?\n\nI have personal reasons why I want to pass in this timeframe, just wondering if it is actually reasonable so I don't waste time 😂.

It's easy and convenient to have in on my phone so I can practice when commuting to work or when I have a moment here and there.\n\nBut the problem I'm having is that there are a lot of complex translations. I know that kanji can mean a lot of different things, but my teacher said that you don't have to learn all of them. E.g. I've practiced 上. To English it's translated to above/up, and she said that that is what I should focus on, and that the other translations is more advanced.\n\n**So to my question**, are there any decks that are simpler? Just to start with. There are a lot of other anki apps, so if anyone knows a better one the I can switch. But I haven't found a simpler deck... or maybe if anyone know anther good app for learning kanji?\n\nMaybe there is something I've missed about anki, I have just \"researched\"/tried it for a few days, but I feel a bit lost.\n\nThank you so much!",
