        "text": "Lets talk about informed consent with regards to 'volunteering' data that will then be analyzed and mined or in this case 'volunteering' data that will be analyzed and mined and also potentially stolen and then analyzed and mined. \n\nThere are three main elements of informed consent. From the wiki. \n\n&gt;Disclosure requires the researcher to supply each prospective subject with the information necessary to make an autonomous decision and also to ensure that the subject adequate understands the information provided. This latter requirement implies that a written consent form be written in lay language suited for the comprehension skills of subject population, as well as assessing the level of understanding through conversation.\n\n&gt;Capacity pertains to the ability of the subject to both understand the information provided and form a reasonable judgment based on the potential consequences of his/her decision.\n\n&gt;Voluntariness refers to the subject’s right to freely exercise his/her decision making without being subjected to external pressure such as coercion, manipulation, or undue influence.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFacebook is fundamentally unable to inform their users. Almost daily there are new advances in the types of inferences that can be made from existing data. As an example, there was a recent discovery that researchers can predict a user's sexuality from just their profile picture with a high degree of accuracy. This is new research. The leading experts in the field didn't know that was possible, until suddenly it was. How is an average user supposed to know of these threats?  How is Facebook supposed to properly inform users of data inferences that don't even exist yet? \n\nLook at this article on how Google can unblur photos. It is unreasonable to expect users to stay current with this research. \n\nhttp://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-brain-ai-pictures-blur\n\nHow can a user have that kind of foresight? There can be no consent without the subject being informed and these companies are unable to inform the subjects even if thats all they wanted to do and were willing forfeit all their profits to do so. \n\n\nIt's a mistake to allow the narrative to be framed as though it's the fault of the users for providing their data. The argument that people provide their consent to facebook is wrong. The idea that people consented to give their data to Facebook is wrong. \n\n\n&gt;Voluntariness refers to the subject’s right to freely exercise his/her decision making without being subjected to external pressure such as coercion, manipulation, or undue influence.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn many places Facebook \\_is_ the internet. It's integrated into school, it's how business is done, it's how government officials talk with the public. Landlords or employers can require it. The idea that people aren't subjected to external pressure when their ability to participate in civic society or rent an apartment is dependent on them having a facebook account is ludicrous. \n\nDeleting facebook is all well and dandy but it's no solution to Facebook or surveillance capitalism in general. Deleting facebook is kind of like achieving a net carbon footprint of zero. Congrats! But individual choices aren't a solution to climate change nor do your actions do anything to insulate you from the dangers of climate change. The same is true of facebook. \n\nThe savviest most well informed user in the world ultimately cannot stop his relatives from becoming users/customers who inevitably will reveal data about you.\n\nFurther, Facebook also has shadow profiles for non users. Don't be a asshole and smugly post that Zuckerberg quote from college. Facebook has ~1.4 billion daily active users. Do you \\_really_ think the average user is aware of what some douchebag silicon valley guy said in college? Do you \\_really_ think the onus is on them? It's not helpful. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAccording to the UN facebook is fueling the genocide in Myanmar. Another report showed Facebook was responsible for a 10% increase in attacks against immigrants in Germany. We need to actually present solutions to this! \n\nThe short term solution to Facebook is regulation. Regulation might include antitrust enforcement, laws against the retention of behavioral data, laws allowing users to revoke the use of their data, laws allowing any user to download their full profile or migrate their profile/data to another service/revoke the use of their data, and advocates for the user with *real power*. We need to look whether they are in violation of laws and treaties against human experimentation. We need unionization for employees. State attorney generals could look to whether Facebook is in violation of their state's private investigator laws. They can explore if they are in violation of labor laws by allowing discriminatory advertising against protected classes of people. We need people thinking about this stuff because one way or another facebook is going to get regulated. We should redefine the debate in our terms. What we don't need is leftists saying \"vote with their data.\"\n\nMost of this is applicable to tech companies other than Facebook. \n\nTLDR: Users aren't providing their informed consent. Facebook isn't capable of properly informing their users even if they wanted to. Blaming users bad, regulating facebook good. Facebook will eventually get regulated. If we don't want that regulation coming from the right or center then we need to get into the weeds on this stuff and offer solutions from the left. ",
