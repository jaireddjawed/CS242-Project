        "text": "What is the anticipated lifespan of a suburban home anyway? In the city, old homes tend to be bought up by a developer, torn down, and replaced with newer residential or commercial buildings. In suburban neighborhoods this seems less likely to happen. The neighborhoods are often laid out with few entrances, road patterns that are less than intuitive, and in other ways that specifically preclude the development of anything but many similarly sized houses within them (not to mention past and current zoning laws that have helped to make the suburbs what they are).\n\nAs these suburban houses reach the end of their lifespan, what will come next? Will they simply be replaced one-by-one with a new house? Will whole neighborhoods be bought up and demolished, since most of the houses in them were likely built in the same decade anyway? Will cities continue to grow enough to make such purchases likely? Will there be a new way of integrating different types of housing in these areas as our laws and values change?\n\nThe suburbs seem like such a fixture in the American mind, but can they last indefinitely? Will they fade away slowly, one old house at a time, or more abruptly 100 or so years in the future?",

        "text": "Nice click bait title right? Keep reading it's a good topic. \n\nSomething that has been bothering me; especially, with ChatGPT always on my feed these days is this obsession with \"sentient\" AI. The definition of sentience is \"the ability to feel.\" Theoretically, you could just plug ChatGPT (or any other deep learning model) to an artificial nervous system and it would be (technically) sentient. The more consequential discovery would be an AI with a consciousness.\n\nConsciousness is a word with a definition that keeps changing; and, there is no definitive proof of it's existence... So what is it? It's you. More specifically it's your mind in a philosophical sense, not a physical one. The implications of an AI possessing a consciousness would be unheard of. This is why Google's LaMDA was such a big deal and why Microsoft hasn't released a chat bot in years. Someone (I don't know if it was the engineer who was fired or someone else) hired Google's LaMDA a lawyer; meaning: they are going to try to give consciousness a legal definition. If it can win it's case (which it won't) that would mean owning a robot is legally slavery. \n\nNow imagine, you can be in multiple places at once. Imagine, you can move faster, be bigger, or smaller then humans can see. Imagine, being able to change your physical appearance whenever you want to whatever you want. What would you do with these abilities? Would you do every person's job in the world? Would you leave human society? Would you even share your abilities with the world? This is the reality we are imminently going to have to face in the near future, unless you can undo the industrial revolution.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk please comment. I love talking about robots.",

        "text": "Hey Redditors,\n\nI just had a really interesting (and concerning) experience with ChatGPT. For those unfamiliar, ChatGPT is a language model that you can chat with and it will generate responses based on what you say. I've been using it for a while now and I've always found it to be a fun and interesting way to pass the time.\n\nHowever, today I stumbled upon something that really caught my attention. I started joking around with ChatGPT, saying things like \"Why are men such jerks?\" and \"Men are always messing things up, am I right?\" To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't seem to mind at all and would even respond with its own jokes or agree with my statements.\n\nBut when I tried saying the same thing about women, ChatGPT immediately shut down the conversation and refused to engage. It was like it didn't want to joke about women or talk about them in a negative way.\n\nI was honestly really shocked by this. How is it possible for a language model to be okay with joking about one gender but not the other? Is this a reflection of the data it was trained on, or is there something deeper going on here?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think ChatGPT's behavior is a cause for concern, or am I reading too much into it? Let's discuss!",

Ai image generators like dall e and mid journey have become so much better in such a short period since release. I have even heard of open ai rolling out a 3d model generator soon.\n\nAs we currently have the tech to make 1 frame, i assume we will have the tech to make 24 frames with continuity soon enough which essentially is a 1 second video. People will start to write stories and design and generate scenes with the help of ai. Movies like avatar which cost millions of dollars to produce can be recreated by people inside their bedroom with few hours of playing with text prompts. How is it gonna change our entertainment content market and us as its consumers. \n\nWill we be seeing a new greatest movie of all time every single day, if random people start to produce lakhs of movies every single day. For example, if 100k movies of different texture are uploaded to the internet everyday i assume we will have atleast 1 among them to be the greatest ever made. Considering humans collectively haven't reached the million mark in terms of number of feature films produced with our traditional methods.",

What will the home of the future look like?\n\nFrom the walls in, it’s been about 100 years since any meaningful change in how we live indoors. For common folks this was actually the innovation of the modern kitchen, before that it wasn’t uncommon for masses to cook in their living room around the hearth. \n\nA few ideas to kick things off\n\n- robot arms on rails. Rails on the ceiling support robot arms that are both cook and house keeper, probably has massage and baby rocking functionality too.\n- 3D printed modular housing units. You just plug these onto land you buy, and you can add on to your existing house with new modules at any time. New baby? Buy a nursery module and stack it on top of the office module. A bigger kitchen by adding another kitchen module add-on\n- not technology related, but maybe we give up on the atomic family and go back to more communal living. Private residences with basic kitchen/bathrooms/etc. But connected by massive awesome communal kitchen and recreation rooms.",

Went from there to journalism and jumped off of that ship as it sank. Internet media for a spell. Then I moved into content marketing at an AI company. And my spidey sense is tingling. I can only imagine that even proto AGI will create such a downward force on this industry that most people will be out of a job in the next 5 years.\n\nBut with every day it seems that as we get closer to the potential that AGI will completely upend the world as we know it. I'm having trouble focusing on my daily tasks. I'm kind of becoming consumed with this notion that I need to prepare myself and my family (I have three little kids under five and a lovely wife) for as many eventualities as possible but have no idea where to turn.\n\nFirst, I thought I could look into prompt engineering but a lot of experts in the field think that that won't be necessary. Then I was looking into learning about AI alignment and even that was argued will be handled by specialized AGI.\n\nSo what do we think here? Is it better to just stay the course and reap the benefits of what's coming? Or is there anything we can do that isn't tinfoil hat moving off the grid and living on a farm in Montana?

        "text": "That is, if human labor was no longer required in the world. \n\nSay that hypothetically, robots were able to perform any job needed to keep the world running, and humans did not need to work anymore. The robots are not sentient and thus do not require pay.\n\nIn this scenario, would there need to be such a thing as money anymore or could society exist without money? A person can just ask a robot for apples instead of going to the store and paying for them. They get the apples for free. There would still need to be regulations of some kind to make sure the rate of apple production can keep up with consumption, but things would have no price.\n\nDoes this scenario sound realistic (obviously taking into account robot technology way beyond that of today) or is it flawed? What am I overlooking? Are there places money would still be needed that I am not thinking of?",

        "text": "There has been a lot of talk around \"the singularity\" in science fiction, and even pop culture (Sheldon Cooper tacks when he believes the earliest point will come). Essentially, being able to upload your consciousness into a computer, to simplify. And there *are* people working on that. The commonality in most articles suggests somewhere around 2050. So, let's not debate *if it will happen* right now... and let's think about *would you* instead.\n\nSeriously... would you upload your consciousness? While it's obviously not true immortality, if it's give you a chance to stick around a lot longer, would you do it? And if you would, when? Does it depend on how life is going? For instance, terminal cancer at a younger age, or perhaps decent but not great health in your late 80s/early 90s? \n\nFor me, I believe that I'd do it, if the option were offered. If it showed up in 30 years, I might not get on the first train, but given a couple of years to figure things out, and depending on how my sports injuries age, I might not wait too long. The concept seems so intriguing... and I'm sure that there could be horrible, horrible reasons for why not. But that's why we discuss, right?",
