On the other hand, I'm quite put off by the atrocities that he committed in the old testament and some of the views that the bible seems to convey that don't sit well in a modern context.

        "text": "For as long as I could remember I was very much against the sin of Lust. I did not enjoy sexual appeal or sexual attraction in general, and interpreted it as being naturally chaste. However, earlier this year I learned that I was Asexual, which means that I did not have sexual feelings in general.\n\nAs an example: There are vegetarians who don't eat meat for moral reasons (Chaste), and there are vegetarians who don't eat meat because they just don't enjoy it (Asexual)\n\nI started thinking about this more and came to a worrying realization that maybe I'm not a virtuous as I think I am due to the physical lack of temptations in my life. For example: There have been experiments regarding fear where they would cut out a part of a monkey's brain before and after subjecting it to a rubber snake. Before the process it would be terrified, but afterwards it would be calm and ever curious about the snake. I imagine that there have been similar experiments done with someone's rage. Where before hand they would react angrily to a bad situation, but afterwards they would be calm and patient regardless of the situation. In that case, would that person's patience be a virtue because it's good behavior, or not because there was no physically possible way that person can experience or demonstrate wrath?\n\nAnother, more practical example, is the pandemic. Let's say the only bar in your town closed down due to the pandemic, and that you physically could not get access to alcohol by any other means. You then sobered up and broke your addiction, which is never an easy task. Finally, the bar reopens. Is the ex-drinker virtuous because they did not go out of there way to get alcohol? What about the other people in that town who did not have the same problem as the ex-drinker? Were they virtuous for staying away from temptation all together, or not because that was never even on their mind? Does any of this change after the bar re-opens where the temptation re-presents itself?\n\nObviously you should always try to be good. I try to be as good and kind to others as I can, but my fear though is that my actions and values have turned moot since there was nothing especially good about them in the first place. I'm not really religious, but I share some base values that overlap with Christianity. So I figured that this subreddit would be the best place to ask about this",

        "text": "A few days ago, I made a new post which asked if suffering is real, and if so, what is the proof suffering is real. I did this even though I do believe suffering is a real phenomena. The reason why is because in the past month, there have been 29 other posts in r/religion which discuss or include suffering. Most of these posts are actually by those who are atheist and a few are by people of various faiths discussing aspects of suffering and why it exists. \n\nOn my post, no person was able to express an actual evidence-based proof of the existence of suffering. The responses I did get were by people of faith who believe suffering exists because they are able to feel it within their own experiences, or they consider the experiences of others as that of suffering. I whole-heartedly agree with this methodology to consider whether something is real or not. Not a single atheist, despite their disposition to use suffering as a common argument for their cause, responded. They probably silently understood the implications of what I was going to get to. \n\nGiven a great majority of suffering based posts are by atheists, a group who will deny the existence of God because there is no actual evidence-based proof (in their view), a suitable (but cold) response would be to ask the atheist what is the evidence-based proof of your suffering? They will unable to do so because suffering is a feeling and a perception of reality, it exists solely within the scope of our psychology and emotions which are definitely real.\n\nGetting people to stop blaming God for suffering, or to stop believing in God due to suffering, would really help the case of people of faith greatly. Suffering exists on a spectrum, to varying degrees, and it is how we react to it which defines our soul's journey.",

Here I'm only talking about Quran is because other scriptures don't claim that they are infallible.\n\nIndividually the most common answers I get is\n\n1) Quran is not a book of science and everything is figurative language.\n\n2) Some muslims straight up deny, that there are none.\n\n3) Some say you have to learn the arabic to complete understand, they mean that mistakes are in translation.\n\nI want to know what is the scholarly view on this. What do the majority of muslims believe?\n\nI am not trying to attack islam or anything, I'm genuinely curious because whenever I read the Quran it's kinda hard to ignore that there are mistakes and yet people don't talk about it.",

        "text": "Hi. I mean no offence by this, but why do people convert to Christianity, specifically those of a European ethnic background? I know how it is if you are born into it—I was 'raised' Catholic—, but I really struggle to find it interesting to convert to. I am speaking as an Englishman. I think the way we have dressed up Christianity—the folk customs, the ecclesiatical customs, the appropriations of pagan practices, the folk superstitions and legends, the aesthetics we have attached to it in each country, the 'high church' song, the medieval theology, the way Greek philosophy has been interwoven with it—are more interesting than Christianity itself.\n\nIf Christianity was just the Bible—the story of the world's creation, the story of the race of Judeans and their folklore, the Judean Messianic prophecy, a guy called Jesus descended from the Judeans coming to fulfil Messianic prophecy, the power struggle between Pharisee Judeans and Jesuit Judeans, the oppression of Judeans at the hands of Rome, the legend of Jesus's return, and the myth of the End Times—and the ascetic lifestyle that Jesus lived, then I think Christianity would not appeal very much at all to most Europeans. In essence, Christianity has been White-washed, when in truth it was and is fundamentally Judaism 2.0 with an ascetic and socially radical flavour. Ironically, Jesus was like a literal proto-communist Jew—how does that make many conservative Christians feel?\n\nI compare, for example, Germanic or Slavic mythology to the Bible, and I feel more of a connection to the former two than the struggle of an ancient tribe and their saviour to whom I feel no connection whatsoever. So it is funny for me how classic Englishmen, such as Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Chesterton, and Belloc, all viewed Christianity as some inherently English thing; it might as well be Babylonian folklore for me 🤷‍♂️ I know Christianity was used to unite the Danish-ruled pagan north of England and the Christian Anglo-Saxon-ruled south of England, but when you really study Christianity, at its core, it is anything but English or European. So it is amusing to me, absurd, when conservative Europeans latch onto Christianity.\n\nI read all of Genesis, and I have to say I was not positively inspired; it seems like a book not intended for me. It seems really ethnocentric—which is fine, but it's not intended for me. I read Ecclesiastes, and like many others, I liked this book; it mostly just made sense.\n\nSo this is part of why I am not a Christian.\n\nI am interested in hearing from any converts to Christianity from a European background, or people who share my same 'aversion', for want of a better word.\n\nSome black people I have heard say that Christianity is 'the white man's religion', but I think far from it: it is the Jewish man's religion, which has been strangely stretched by Apostle Paul to all people.\n\nNone of this is intended racistly by the way (if that is even an adverb). I have no problem with Jewish people.",

And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God.\"\n\n5 When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died.

Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.\"\n\n10 At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.\n\n11 Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events. (Ac.5:1-10).",

        "text": "It seems that person-to-person forgiveness is highlighted by Jesus and St. Paul more than in the Old Testament. The Old Testament also put more emphasis on forgiveness from God, or collective forgiveness (e.g. God forgiving Israel for turning to Idols), but not as much on personal forgiveness. Many patriarchs in the Old Testament lived and died resenting even members in their own family. Families such as that of Jacob were heavily dysfunctional, full of resentment among brothers and wives, and the Bible does not hide this fact but highlights it as a sad reality.\n\nMy hypothesis is that forgiveness is the method Christianity chosen to face resentment, just as other people thought that revenge or stoicism was a better response to it. \n\nMaybe personal forgiveness was already part of Judaism at Jesus' times? After all, many features of Christianity seem to be borrowed from unique views of 2nd Temple's Judaism.\n\nPersonally, as a Christian, I don't think you can forgive everyone, and Jesus seems to be kind of aware of this as he did not think someone who perverted or hurt a child must be forgiven (Luke 17:2).\n\nIf someone killed your wife or raped your daughter, I don't think forgiveness is an option for most of us. However, I find it disturbing that so many people use those examples as an excuse to not forgive anyone at all, and the fact some people do not speak to even their own family for a political discussion 2 years ago or for not visiting their wedding, is by itself a concern that every person that believes in forgiveness shall reconsider.",

When you're born you live on God's will and as you approach the age of accountability your will supercedes God's will so you get farther and farther from God. Same goes with time: the farther we get from the point of creation the further we get from gods will.. that's why they were able to live for thousands of years.

Essentially, they have their own version of moral relativism. But that relativism is based on a theology. In other words, their theology influences their political views. \n\nSo when people say they want separation of church and state and for religion and politics to have nothing to do with each other, how will this be achieved?",

Depictions of Jesus or God is commonplace in virtually every Church worldwide. Is there a reason why Christianity took this rule out?",
