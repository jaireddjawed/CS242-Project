        "text": "I'm doing the \"Exercise on negative polarity\" in Section 6.6 of the book by Heim and Kratzer. It asks you to characterize quantifiers that make sentences like the following grammatical:\n\n(1) Q people ever went.\n\n(2) Q people who ever went were happy.\n\nFor example, (1) is grammatical with Q=\"No\" or Q=\"Few\", but ungrammatical with Q=\"All\" or Q=\"Some\". Meanwhile, (2) is grammatical with Q=\"All\" or Q=\"No\", but ungrammatical with Q=\"Some\" or Q=\"Two\". The setting is formalized as follows. Quantifiers are relations on the set of sets of individuals. For example for Q=\"All\", the sentence\n\nQA B\n\nis true iff A ‚äÇ B, and for Q=\"Some\" it is true iff A ‚à© B  ‚â† ‚àÖ.\n\nOkay, so for which Q is (1) true? I made a big table showing which quantifiers have certain formal properties. The set of quantifiers making (1) grammatical coincided with the set of \"right downward monotone quantifiers\", that is, those with\n\nA ‚äÇ B, CQB  ‚áí CQA.\n\nQuick googling seems to agree with this solution. The key phrase is \"downward entailment\" licencing negative polarity items. But what about (2)? Well, we can try applying this \"downward entailment\" here as well. if QAB is grammatical with B involving \"ever\" iff Q is right downward monotone, then I suspect QAB is grammatical with A involving \"ever\" iff Q is *left* downward monotone.\n\nThis *mostly* fits with my table, which predicts that (2) is grammatical with \"Every\" and \"No\", but not with \"Some\", \"Two\", \"Most\". That doesn't seem quite right, since the sentence is grammatical with \"Most\". (At least I think so, I'm not a native speaker. But Google gives over a million hits for \"Most people who ever\", and only 5 hits for \"Some people who ever\".)\n\nSo my question is: What *is* a correct characterization of quantifiers allowed in (2)? Is my idea salvageable? I had no luck googling. I found in a few places that \"Every person who ever went\" is fine, but no generalization or explanation.",

This thought crossed my mind while I was looking at some dubbed Disney songs in other languages. I realised the \"information density per syllable\" of a language is an important factor when it comes to songwriting and translations, since if the same meaning has to fit into a longer phrase with more syllables, it would require having to change the rhythm of the lyrics, or cutting out important bits of information.  \n\n\nFor example, the Japanese version of \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" definitely has some rhythm changes to the song: [https://youtu.be/hUY3ul8Y1j4](https://youtu.be/hUY3ul8Y1j4).   \n\n\nAdditionally, extending from this, given languages with high information to syllable ratios, it can be argued that they allow for more lyrical freedom to fit into a rhythm of a song. I know that according to this [paper](https://sci-hub.se/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/449938/pdf). English, Vietnamese and Chinese are good contenders with the highest amount of information conveyed per syllable. Are there any others?",

We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions ‚Äî if you‚Äôre looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we‚Äôll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search ‚Äî you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it‚Äôs sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature ‚Äî unless it‚Äôs a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it‚Äôs a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature ‚Äî remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests ‚Äî for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism ‚Äî such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe‚Äôll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You‚Äôre free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don‚Äôt get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it‚Äôs already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you‚Äôre not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you‚Äôve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won‚Äôt come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice ‚Äî basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list ‚Äî follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

From this langauge, which you probably guessed is a conlang, I hoped to make no money from or monetize it in any way. I just got sick of nobody wanting to learn it, as the death of many conlangs stems from nobody else's desire to learn it. \n\nTo those who live in Tajikistan and the surrounding countries, I sincerely apologize for appropriating you and your culture. That was 100% wrong to do, and I take full blame for it and am willing to bear the brunt of the criticism.\n\nYou don't have to accept my apology, and I am open to the criticism and question, but I do not want to start drama with people.

I really can't comprehend why our school system does not place more emphasis on pronunciation. I would argue that it's very useful knowledge to possess.\n\nI will admit it took me quite a while until I got a hang of it. Actually, to this day I am not quite sure if I am pronuncing it correctly... I think I am, but I have no native English speakers near me to consult with.\n\nI wonder, are natives actually all that sensitive to the difference? If somebody pronunced \"three\" the same way as, \"free\", would you notice that? Do you think most English natives would be consciously aware of the difference? \n\nIs that a common occurence amongst other non-natives, or is it just a Polish phenomenon?

In particular two notable periods of national language policy were brought up which the author argues brought a significant effect on Japanese written language ; \n\n1. the first being the \"Genbun Itchi\" reform in the Meiji period (1910s) where written language which followed classical conventions was made to follow the spoken language, and\n2. the second being the discourse on national language policy following defeat in world war 2 and US Occupation (1946), where there was a society wide discourse that Japanese should adopt a totally different writing system which although there being proposals which included abandoning the use of Chinese Characters or total romanization, ended ultimately in a set of \"standard kanji\" which constituted a reduction of characters and simplified the writing of particular characters.\n\nWhile the ostensible objective of these language reforms were to increase literacy and make it easier for common people to acquire reading, the author argues that such an effect of the reforms was ultimately marginal as literacy rates in Japan during the time of these reforms were comparable to other countries at equal stages of societal development. The Author finds that such language reforms were ultimately detrimental to the written language as by aiming to make Japanese closer to a phonetic or alphabetic orthography, they effected an elimination of semantic meaning that could only be contained and communicated in writing.\n\nThe argument made by the author is that any language reform which aims to make the written language conform to spoken language (how words are pronounced) effects a destruction of the semantic meaning contained in writing. This argument suggests that this \"semantic simplification\" has wrought massive damage to the literature of Korea which adopted Hangul and Viet Nam which adopted romanization from both languages previously being written using Chinese Characters. From my own layperson's view this argument seems persuasive as I can imagine for instance what would happen if English or French decided to reform orthography so words were to be spelled solely according to how they were pronounced.\n\nIt was also mentioned that this societal policy to make literacy easier was adopted by scientists (I can't recall whom) that held the theory of Darwinist evolution in human language where it was thought that written language develops from pictograms, to logograms, ultimately arriving at an alphabet. \n\n**Conclusion and Questions:**\n\nI'd like to hear what the people here think about the author's position that aiming to reduce the differences between writing and spoken language amounts to the limitation of writing, that writing has little to gain and all to lose through social policies aiming at standardization. Is there another side of the argument on the effects of society-wide language policy? Is the theory of writing system evolution still credible in today's age? \n\nAny relevant linguistics sources and comments would be very useful for me as I find this a really interesting topic I know little about. If anything is unclear or you would like me to elaborate on certain points I'd gladly do so.",

In the meantime, I worked IT jobs (not my favorite thing) and did some copy writing/editing, including an unpaid volunteer gig as editor-in-chief of a nonprofit's newsletter. \n\nI've applied to grad schools but won't hear back from them for another few months (I think I stand a decent shot at getting in - decent GPA at 3.56). So now I'm hunting for jobs in copy editing, writing, and so on. Although I'm familiar with AP, APA, and Chicago styles and although I have 3 years of experience not only editing but running a team and publishing, I don't seem to be taken very seriously by anybody. I'd very much like to change that. \n\nI will take another IT job if I really have to - it's getting to be looking that way - but I really want to do something I like for a change. I mean I can do anything for a few months, right? Of course, if I don't get in to a grad school I'm worried I'll be stuck in a field I really don't like.\n\nOf course it doesn't help that I'm kind of stuck where I am; but where I am is the fastest growing Midwest city second only to Chicago (Columbus OH) so it should (and does) have plenty of jobs in that field. I can't move because I don't have the money and because my fiancee has a job here that she can't leave (not that that would be a good idea anyway if I get into a grad school somewhere else entirely).\n\nI wonder if there's any resources for this sort of thing. And I wonder if there's another field I could check out. I am not very fluent in any foreign language though and I don't know what else to do. \n\nAny thoughts?",

The idea is to provide a snippet of information about a language or a group of languages, just enough for you to recognise patterns, formulate a hypothesis and solve the task, without any prior knowledge about the languages necessary. Have fun!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Puzzle #1**\n\n(by Tom Payne)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following list of words is from the Agta language of the Central Cagayan Valley in the Northern island of Luzon, in the Philippines. There are now only about 600 speakers of this variety of Agta, although there are perhaps 10,000 people in the Philippines who speak other varieties also known as Agta. The Agta people now speak an Austronesian language similar to other languages spoken in the Philippines. However, they are descended from the Melanesian people who were present in the Philippines before the Austronesian peoples arrived. The Agta language is now seriously endangered.\n\n1. wer - creek\n\n2. balabahuy - little pig\n\n3. talobag - beetle\n\n4. bakbakat - granny\n\n5. palapirak - little money\n\n6. bahuy - pig\n\n7. bag - loincloth\n\n8. walawer - little creek\n\n9. balabag - little loincloth\n\n10. takki - leg\n\n11. labang - patch\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you have enough information to translate the following words into Central Cagayan Agta:\n\nlittle leg, money, little beetle (this is the word for 'lady bug'), little patch, little granny\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShort answer: &gt;!little leg = talatakki, money = pirak, little beetle = talatalobag, little patch = lalalabang, little granny = balabakbakat!&lt;\n\nExplanation: &gt;!The prefix for ‚Äúlittle‚Äù is formed by the first sound of the root + /ala/!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Puzzle #2**\n\n(by Kibrik A.Ye., adapted)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow are Ancient Greek words in Nominative (left) and Genitive cases without diacritics. Translations are for reference only, they are not relevant for solving the puzzle.\n\nŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑lŒπœà ‚Äî Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑lŒπœÜŒøc (attic)\n\nœÄŒ±Œπc ‚Äî œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥Œøc (child)\n\nŒ±ŒπŒæ ‚Äî Œ±ŒπŒ≥Œøc (goat)\n\nŒ±ŒπŒ∏ŒπŒøœà ‚Äî Œ±ŒπŒ∏ŒπŒøœÄŒøc (Ethiopian)\n\nœÄŒπœÑœÖc ‚Äî œÄŒπœÑœÖŒøc (pine tree)\n\nŒ∫ŒøœÅœÖc ‚Äî Œ∫ŒøœÅœÖŒ∏Œøc (helmet)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou also have this set of Greek-based English words for reading convenience:\n\nœÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒøŒæ... - paradox\n\nŒ∫œÖŒ≤ŒµœÅŒΩŒ∑œÑ... - cybernet(ics)\n\nœÜŒπŒªŒøœÉŒøœÜ.. - philosoph(y)\n\nŒ≥œÖœà... - gyps(um)\n\nœáŒ±Œøc - chaos\n\nŒΩŒµŒ∫œÑŒ±œÅ - nectar\n\nŒ∏ŒµŒº(Œ±) - them(e)\n\nMind that all vowels read as in Spanish; Œ∫ always reads k; Œ≥ is g as in get; ch as in Loch Ness; and Œ¥ is a form of c.\n\nœÖ is similar to /u/ in June but is always rendered as \"y\" in Greek loanwords into English.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Task:** Determine Nominative forms for the following nouns (here in Genitive):\n\n1. ŒøœÅŒΩŒπŒ∏Œøc (bird); 2. Œ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œøc (Arab); 3. ŒøŒΩœÖœáŒøc (talon); 4. œÄœÅŒøŒ≤lŒ∑œÑŒøc (cape, promontory).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Short answer:*&gt;! 1. ŒøœÅŒΩŒπc; 2. Œ±œÅŒ±œà; 3. ŒøŒΩœÖŒæ; 4. œÄœÅŒøŒ≤lŒ∑c.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*My thinking:*\n\nI was rather baffled before looking up the tip &gt;!to group the consonants by place of articulation.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!1) Since we need to reconstruct Nominative from Genitive, lets look at the N=&gt;G transitions. The simplest is /-os/ =&gt; √ò in œÄŒ±Œπc =&gt; œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥Œøc and /-os/ =&gt; /-s/ in œÄŒπœÑœÖŒøc =&gt; œÄŒπœÑœÖc. This obvious correlation of /-s/ in N and /-os/ in G can also be seen in all the other nouns.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!2) The real trick is the mutating consonant root endings. We don't have enough data to reconstruct sound-by-sound correspondences, which implies we need to group the available consonants. Pooling the main text of the puzzle with the task, we find the wider range of consonants in Genitive, and it consists of labials (bpf), gutturals (gkh), and dentals (dtŒ∏).!&lt;\n\n&gt;!3) In the bpf group, we see that both /p/ and /f/ converge on /p/ in Nominative (with the /-os/ for G changing to /-s/ for N, as we've already established). In the other two groups, we only have one example each, but if we assume similar pattern, it'd mean converging on /k/ in gkh and on √ò in dtŒ∏, respectively.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!4) Therefore, keeping in mind that /ps/ and /ks/ have their own special letters: Œ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œøc =&gt;  \\*Œ±œÅŒ±œà (bpf group), ŒøœÅŒΩŒπŒ∏Œøc =&gt;  \\*ŒøœÅŒΩŒπc and œÄœÅŒøŒ≤lŒ∑œÑŒøc =&gt; \\*œÄœÅŒøŒ≤lŒ∑c (dtŒ∏ group), and ŒøŒΩœÖœáŒøc =&gt; \\*ŒøŒΩœÖŒæ (gkh group). Which, incidentally, correlates nicely to the stone onyx in English.!&lt;",

I‚Äôm not a native speaker of English so my judgments could be false, but I really feel them to be very much a word game.\n\nFor example, the NP ‚Äústudents of linguistics‚Äù contains a PP complement ‚Äúof linguistics.‚Äù Then, the NP ‚Äúlinguistics students‚Äù seems to have the same meaning. And what is conveyed in the previous PP complement now is in the specifier. In what sense, a complement of NPs ‚Äúcompletes the meanings?‚Äù\n\nMoreover, in deletion test, we can delete an optional constituent like an adjunct, but not a complement. Consider this sentence (one of my lecture materials to illustrate the deletion test): John will publish a book about the origin of language next year. ‚ÄúNext year‚Äù can be deleted; ‚Äúabout the origin of language‚Äù can also be deleted (the prof said it is an adjunct different from the of-structure). But ‚Äúof language‚Äù cannot be deleted. I can easily accept this. But the question remains: if I change ‚Äúthe origin of language‚Äù to ‚Äúlanguage origin,‚Äù then it seems that the specifier ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù is equally unlikely to be deleted; similarly, if I change the about-PP to ‚Äúof the origin of language,‚Äù then it seems that this complement can also be readily deleted just like the adjunct.

        "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nIn my school, the science fair is coming up. My school is a really small one, with only around 60 students in all high school. Because of this, Science Fair in my school is a really small event compared to other schools. The school doesn't choose any winners due to this, basically everyone gets an A+ on their project, and we also have a lot of liberty on what project we want to choose for our science fair. \n\nSince I don't really have to worry too much about the science fair, I would like to take advantage of this and use this science fair as a way to do a project based around linguistics.  This is because I feel that it could be a great opportunity to learn how to do a research project, and because I have been recently getting a great interest in linguistics. However, I'm having a little bit of trouble choosing a project I would like to do.\n\nThe first idea that came up to my mind, was to do a project on how personal pronouns (tu vs usted) in Spanish affect the way you perceive your family members. For context, I live in both the Mexican side and the US side of the US-Mexico border, and because of that, I have access to lots of English speakers and Spanish speakers. The other day I asked a friend of mine whether she referred to her Grandmother by \"usted\" or by \"tu\", to which she answered \"I have a close relationship with my Grandma, so of course I use tu\". This shocked me a lot, since I know a lot of people who refer to their grandparents, and even their parents, by \"usted\" instead of \"tu\", which seems really impersonal. \n\nBecause of that, I wanted to do an experiment on whether people who refer to their Parents/Grandparents by \"tu\" have a stronger relationship than those who refer to their Parents/Grandparents by \"usted\". As you all might have noticed however, it is almost imposible to objectively measure something as abstract as \"a strong relationship\". How would I even go on about measuring \"a strong relationship\"? It is a pretty difficult thing to do objectively, and because of that, I had to discard that project idea, or at least, plan it out better.\n\nAnyways, I would like to know if there any possible ideas for projects that I could do based on linguistics, or if not, at least I would like to know if there could be a way to modify my original project in order to make it more objective.\n\nThank you in advance, and sorry if my ideas seem all over the place; I am not a very good writer and my poor English doesn't help the cause that much either.",

Dutch X, Low German Y‚Äô. I see two possible opposing forces at play here:\n\n1. Any Germanic root that we don‚Äôt happen to see attested in Old English or Old Norse got ascribed to Dutch or Middle Low German, when it might be a general West Germanic word that simply hasn‚Äôt survived in the not too huge OE corpus. Is there much research on how much this could be due to? Seems there could at least be some statistical guesstimates. \n\n2. A lot of words in English do indeed seem to have genuinely come in from Dutch/Flemish in the late medieval period (with Flemish migration from around 1300) through to the Dutch Golden Age, or from Low German (via the English association with the Hanseatic League). Low German is generally unfairly merged with ‚ÄòGerman‚Äô and even ‚ÄòGermanic‚Äô in most people‚Äôs minds, so I get that, but is Dutch unfairly ignored as a major influence on English in most popular summaries?",

In my opinion (as a native Greek speaker with no linguistics qualifiations), Medieval Greek reads as little more than exceptionally fancy Modern Greek, and sounds identical to it.\n\nPhonetically, Greek had an evolutionary explosion with iotacism, frication of aspirated consonants and a few other changes by up to the 5th century AD or so and then very few things have changed till modern times. The only advancement in Greek phonetics that I'm aware of during the last millennium is the gradual loss of prenasalisation in voiced plosives, and that's merely a phonetic and not a phonemic change - plus it's still taking place.\n\nGrammar and syntax evolved a bit more evenly since ancient times, I reckon, but by the turn of the second millennium Greek had become mutually intelligible with its modern counterpart, reading as somewhat conservative Modern Greek (the previously prescribed \"katharevousa\"). \n\nI've also heard that Icelandic is very similar to Old Norse, and perhaps Italian and Spanish are similar enough to late Latin. I wonder how the evolution of these languages compares to the evolution of Greek, as well as what may have caused such a glacial evolutionary pace for Greek and perhaps for some of the other languages I mentioned.",
