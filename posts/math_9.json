I’m pretty sure this needs to be some type of sine wave or just do an oval with two foci that’s rotated 90 degrees to form the sine wave. Have trouble calculating these based on the diameter of the pipe. Initial though was to do a calculation for the foci of an oval utilizing 1/2 of the circumference as the wavelength and the hypotenuse of the 30 degree angle of incidence of the pipe diameter as the amplitude of the sine wave. Am I on the right track?",

I’m a first year electrician @BCIT and pretty much all we do is math and physics. At the moment, we are learning about magnetism. In magnetism there are many different transposable formulas pertaining to flux density, reluctance, magnetomotive force, etc. For ex. MMF=coil turns X Amperage, and Beta=Henry’s÷Area squared, Etc. In magnetism like many other things as some value increases/decreases another will increase/decrease. My question would be, are there any ways to look at these Invr/Drct proportions in the formulas themselves? And if so what kind of things can I look for? For ex. A=B•C and X=Y÷Z. Is Z/C directly or inversely proportional to Y/B, and what is the proportion relationship from X/A to Y/B and Z/C. \n\n\nTLdr: Can you look at the operations being done in formulas to identify inverse and direct proportions/ relationships with no numerical values given. For ex. If Y=X÷Z how is X related to Z and would the relationship from Z to Y be different then X to Y because Z is on the other side of the operation. Same goes for if they were being multiplied.",

I only know that I’m broadly interested in geometry/topology. The issue is that the schools I’m choosing between have their own specialties.\n\nWithout making this post too career-oriented, I wanted to ask how I might decide if I would like a particular field of math. For instance, I really like algebraic topology (like the basic stuff you learn in Hatcher), and I’ve enjoyed differential topology, but a bit less than alg top. But I wouldn’t do research in something far-removed from geometry, like pure algebra or pure analysis. Is there any way I could get a sense of what I will enjoy doing research in? Some examples of subfields I’m looking at right now (but have relatively little knowledge in) are low-dimensional topology, homotopy theory, and algebraic geometry.",

For example, a school might have faculty working in geometric group theory, complex geometry, and low-dimensional topology, and no one else working in other areas.\n\nHow should I go about choosing where to go (ignoring factors like location)? I can obviously google a bit about these subjects but it doesn’t seem like I can really get a feel for them without just learning them (and I don’t exactly have time for that). My fear is that I’ll end up going somewhere and then regretting my decision because I could have gone to another school which was better in X field I find super interesting.",

Basically, I left studying math academically 6 years back when I became totally inclined toward the humanities/arts subjects and took up those subjects in my graduation as well.\n\nNow as I am looking for a job, I have come across exams which are conducted by the government which need Quantitative Aptitude, so I had to pick the subject up again. my basic problem is that I am not bad at math as I initially thought when I picked up the subject again, but the fear of it makes me want to run away or escape it like it is a monster, which ultimately doesn't make me wanna do the math. There is so much mental inertia when I have to study it that sometimes the fear overpowers me and I can't do anything at all. but when I convince myself to sit and do sums I realize that I am able to solve sums without much difficulty.\n\nI know the most straightforward answer is practice, but apart from that if anyone who has been in a similar situation could share what they did to get to a better place and overcome the fear would be really helpful.\n\nIf you decide to reply to this, TIA :)",

This means basically that any norm (be it 1,2,..infinity etc.) induces the same - canonical - topology on R\\^n. Here is my question: if we consider the discrete norm (all elements have norm 1 except the zero vector that has norm zero), this induces a topology where all the subset of R\\^n are open that is not the \"usual\" topology. So how  can we accomodate this fact with the previous theorem for which all norms should induce the same topology?",

I recently started enjoying functional programming and machine learning and got into a PhD program in applied math. I have not done differential equations in past 3 years and I am just so scared. I have not done measure theory hence, scared about dynamical systems and also worried about numerical analysis. \n\nHas anyone been in my shoes before? Would love to hear some advice on how can I get started with my preparation and do well in these exams.",

And the dice can land on any real number. What is probability of rolling a whole integer. \n\nI tried the basic way which is:\nTarget outcomes/ possible outcomes \n\nBut obviously that didnt work:\nInfinity / infinity \n\nI feel like this would work if it was even whole integers out of all whole integers because the ratio is two.
