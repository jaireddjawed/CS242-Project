I’ve been trying to ask my mom to pay for private clarenet lessons for my birthday but she says no because I’m not very good haha. I have all As and two Bs (in Spanish and math lol). I’m studying for the PSAT.\n\nMy favorite types of doctors are neurosurgeon and pediatrician. My pediatrician is Kathy. She is nice. I want to go to medical school and become a neurosurgeon or a pediatrician. My favorite organ is the esophagus because it lets you eat food. My favorite food is chocolate cake, Kalamata olives and garlic bread. \n\nI like to play with my baby brother who’s 3 and ANNOYING!! I love him though. I also like to play Bloons TD6 (favorite monkey is super monkey obvs), Genshin Impact, Wild Rift, and RuneScape. My favorite movie is Harry Potter and my favorite superhero is Groot. \n\nI have a dog (Corgi) named Jacob and a cat (orange/white) named Bella. I used to have a fish but he died.

I showed up everyday, I did what I had to do but I noticed that my attending was a little bit odd. The rotation location was random so I had to go to a small town every morning, where this guy was always talking about how he \"loved working alone\". He didn't seem like a mean guy just that kind of guy that I wouldn't spend time with.\nThe last day he told me \"good luck in the future cyclosporine\". The reality this guy is evil, bc after wasting 2 hours every morning to get to this town (he knew it) he decided to give me a 2/10. He gave my performance a 2 in every aspect, which I'm grateful it could be a 1. \nSo that's how I've failed a rotation in which I haven't done anything wrong, just having a weird attending that thinks he can screw over students when they're gone.",

My girlfriend of 4 plus years (not in medicine) is very stressed about the match process. She's a little apprehensive about picking up her life and moving wherever I end up. At the same time this whole process of not knowing is killing her and she seems to be taking it out on me. Has anyone struggled with figuring out where you're going well dating a serious significant other before? I understand it's definitely hard for her, but it's almost like she hates me for going through this process. I honestly don't have any other choice here. Very fortunate to have matched, but I almost feel like if it's not in a location she wants we may not end up together. We're fortunate enough to both be graduating from graduate programs in May, and it would be a good time to move in together but there seems to be a lot of apprehension from her.",

        "text": " GPT-4 can accept a prompt of text and images, which—parallel to the text-only setting—lets the user specify any vision or language task. Specifically, it generates text outputs (natural language, code, etc.) given inputs consisting of interspersed text and images. Over a range of domains—including documents with text and photographs, diagrams, or screenshots—GPT-4 exhibits similar capabilities as it does on text-only inputs. Furthermore, it can be augmented with test-time techniques that were developed for text-only language models, including few-shot and [chain-of-thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) prompting. Image inputs are still a research preview and not publicly available. \n\n\"We preview GPT-4’s performance by evaluating it on a narrow suite of standard academic vision benchmarks. However, these numbers do not fully represent the extent of its capabilities as we are constantly discovering new and exciting tasks that the model is able to tackle. We plan to release further analyses and evaluation numbers as well as thorough investigation of the effect of test-time techniques soon. \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://openai.com/research/gpt-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4)",
