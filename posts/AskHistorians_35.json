        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/115khko/does_the_fact_that_most_us_presidents_share_king/",
        "text": "(pardon me for not phrasing it well, I have basically no formal background in history)\n\nThere's a \"fact\" I've known for years, which is that most of the US presidents share a common ancestor which is King John, who signed the Magna Carta. Problem is, I couldn't find an actual reliable source for this (only reddit posts and news articles like https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/n231ie/til\\_that\\_42\\_out\\_of\\_43\\_us\\_presidents\\_circa\\_2012/ ) so if the \"fact\" is just misinformation then I apologize. Nonetheless, it has gotten me thinking about what it implies about social mobility and reproductive success.\n\nFrom the American President example above, it would seem to imply that \n\n1. A large proportion of the American population would be descended from King John/some similar English royal figure\n2. The majority of them would not have inherited the social status of nobility - aside from it just being numerically impossible for so many nobles to exist, it would also be unlikely that a rich/powerful person in England would choose to emigrate to America if they had a high living standard\n\nGiven these assumptions, and that world population started really dramatically increasing in the Industrial Revolution (3. assume European population size is conserved/increases insignificantly from 1000-1500 AD for example), does it mean that most of the \"lower classes\" are/were actually populated by \"failed\" branches of noble lines? This would also mean that lower classes have low reproductive success, as in their family lines die out and the lower class population is \"replenished\" by nobles who lose their position for some reason? Or is assumption 3 simply not true, and the lower class just keeps expanding in size with both the offspring of lower-class ancestors and \"failed noble\" ancestors?\n\nEven if the American President example is misinformation, similar examples could be found elsewhere. A trivial example I thought of (though perhaps too large-scale) is the prevalence of the surname Li in China/East Asia. After a likely common ancestor in Li Er, the founder of Taoism, numerous prominent historical figures are descended from this lineage, including the military generals Li Xin and Li Guang as well as the emperors of the Tang Dynasty. Interestingly, one of the most famous Chinese poets Li Bai lived during the Tang Dynasty and is supposed to share these ancestors. Significantly, as a wandering poet he was most likely born middle-class/a commoner, making it likely that much of the commoner classes were descended from the Li lineage as well. Does this basically mean the social success of Li Er/the Li ancestors around his time enabled their lineage to dominate the Tang dynasty population nearly a millennium later? Conversely, does this mean the lower-class families back in Li Er's time got absorbed/ended? \n\nOf course, I recognize there is the possibility of people faking their lineages to inherit prestige (see Tang dynasty claims). However, to state the question/discussion at its core, does the shared ancestry of many people in the modern era imply the overwhelming reproductive success of a small number of shared ancestors?",

        "text": "The year is 540. Nearly all of Italy is in the hands of the Romans largely thanks to the skills of Belisarius. The Goths under their king are under siege in their capital of Ravenna and ready for terms. \n\nItaly itself while largely conquered is also despoiled after the war. Naples, Rome, and Milan have all been sacked or sieged. Famine runs through the county side. \n\nAcross the larger empire the Balkans have been ravaged and the Persians are invading again. Justinian sends a peace envoy to the Goth king. Offering them terms that they could reside north of the Po. I've never seen it specified but it seems likely this was as foederati of the empire. \n\nIn history the Goths offer the western crown to Belisarius who feigned acceptance after denying Justinians peace or and used that to gather a number of surrenders from the Goths including their king. He is soon recalled to Constantinople where he is given a triumph and sent to the east. The Gothic war would continue for another fifteen years and Roman Italy would fall to the Lombard invasion a decade after that. \n\nIn hindsight it seems like Justinians peace offer made perfect sense. It would have created a buffer state in Northern Italy against the Franks, Burgundians, Rugians, and Lombards. Potentially would have given Italy a decade of peace to recover. \n\nDid Belisarius let his pride or idealism get in the way or did he read the situation correctly?",

My thesis is about the position of the church (and secular) powers towards Old Saxon and Old High German charms and incantations in the Carolingian Frankish kingdom.\n\nIn the Concilium Germanicum of 742 incantations and charms (along with many other heathen things) were forbidden. In later church councils we see this subject coming back. Yet we see a lot of incantations becoming partly or completely Christian. Elements like \"Ter pater noster\", \"amen\" or the name of Christ can we found in ninth century and tenth century incantations. \n\nHas there been change in the view on charms and incantations by intergrating Christian elements or is it still condemed by the church? According to Brian Murdoch the church wasn't antagonistic to the use of charms once they had become Christian, while Ildar Garipzanov gives proof of partly Christian charms that were still condemed by the church.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there sources or literature about the position of the church against such charms? I am currently using the church council documents to get an image of the position, but maybe there are other sources, articles or books that I can use.",

        "text": "I've been on something of a golden age science fiction kick recently, and noticed the topic of telepathy cropping up rather often. Specifically, the idea that human beings today either have latent psychic powers, or the potential to develop them many generations in the future. This idea is the core conceit of Arthur C. Clarke's novel \"Childhood's End.\" It's also a major plot point in Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy, through both the character The Mule and the organization of The Second Foundation. \n\nWhile there's no shortage of early and mid 20th century science fiction stories that feature telepathy, I mention these two specifically because they're both famous for being leaders in the \"hard\" science fiction genre. They typically didn't go out of their way to introduce especially fanciful plot devices to their books, and were more interested in exploring what they considered legitimate scientific possibilities in their writing. \n\nClarke himself even mentions having believed in the possibility of human telepathy at one time. From his 1989 introduction to Childhood's End:\n\n\"When this book was written in the early 1950s, I was still quite impressed by the evidence for what is generally called the paranormal, and used it as a main theme of the story. Four decades later, after spending some millions of dollars of Yorkshire Television's money researching my *Mysterious World* and *Strange Powers* programs, I am an almost total skeptic.\"\n\nWas Clarke abnormal for having this belief at the time? Would a scientifically minded person in the 50s-60s be likely to believe in human telepathy, or at least the possibility of it? Is that why it appears so often in Science Fiction from the period, or was it simply a popular trope in the genre at the time? If it was the latter, what lead the it falling out of favor?",

This seems to be borne out in retrospect - [Anti-Barney humour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Barney_humor) has a Wikipedia page dedicated to it, and the following statement is made:\n\n&gt;For comparison, other popular preschool children's characters such as Thomas the Tank Engine, Caillou, Dora the Explorer, Bert and Ernie, Elmo, Cookie Monster, Big Bird, Bali, Arthur, Peppa Pig, and the Teletubbies have been subject to subversive adult humor; in Barney's case, however, the humor has typically been far more dark and in a more vicious and hostile nature toward Barney.\n\n1. Was the backlash against *Barney and Friends* considered unusual compared to other children's television shows in the USA at the time?\n2. Most examples in the above article are dated to the first decade of *Barney and Friends*'s run, even though it continued airing until 2010. Was there an actual decrease in the amount of anti-Barney sentiment (or is this just an un-updated article)?\n3. What factors (show-specific or otherwise) contributed to these trends?",

When it was discovered to be him, they brought him before the chief and he was condemned to be burned. However, upon execution of his sentence, his body exploded into hundreds of mosquitos, thus becoming the progenitor of the insect.\n\nI know I didn't come up with this myself, but I can't, for the life of me, find any reference to it online anymore - though I do find the story about the giant whose heart was in his heel.
