I'm still looking for questions to ask myself at the end of every day. These are some that I have come up with, although I would love suggestions.\n\n1) Have I enjoyed my day? (Any day not enjoyed is a wasted day)  \n2) Have I felt beauty today (I am thinking I need to experience some form of unadulterated beauty at least once a day)  \n3) Have I engaged in worthwhile pleasures (I've made some suggestions in recent past about how I feel it is important as an epicurean to choose the 'best' pleasures or at least have a 'balance' of pleasures - I still feel this way)  \n\nAny more suggestions on questions would be very much appreciated.",

        "text": "Desire is different from pleasure. Desire is an urge to be quenched. Pleasure is an appealing sensation. Desires necessarily occur with pleasure, the pleasure of satisfying the urge. Pleasures can occur without desire. Perhaps Epicurus saw all pleasures as desires, and thus advised that we should seek only the necessary desires. But I feel that even when we have satisfied our basic desires (since they are relatively easy to get, perhaps compared to the time of Epicurus) we still have time to fill up with pleasure.\n\nI believe that Epicureanism has a major role to play in our modern world in teaching or guiding people on how to have the most pleasurable days or leisure. After all, leisure is the art of pleasure. If pleasure is divorced from desire, then Epicureans have to come up with a way to judge pleasures, so we choose the better or best ones over the worst ones. Not that any pleasure is in itself bad, I just mean worst comparatively (based on the criteria) to the best.\n\nWithout a criteria/judgement of pleasures, then every pleasure is equivalent. Whether its necrophilia, or videogames, or sports, or poetry. \n\nHaving an art of pleasure or criteria for leisure, would maximize our pleasure and maximize our happiness, if our happiness relies on our pleasure. In our modern society, there is a lot of discontentment, coupled with overwork, less leisure, artificial stimulation, depression, egotism etc. Epicureanism can help a great deal with this.

However, I will not at present claim the first place for mind as against the mixed life; but we must come to some understanding about the second place. For you might affirm pleasure and I mind to be the cause of the mixed life; and in that case although neither of them would be the good, one of them might be imagined to be the cause of the good. And I might proceed further to argue in opposition to Philebus, that the element which makes this mixed life eligible and good, is more akin and more similar to mind than to pleasure. And if this is true, pleasure cannot be truly said to share either in the first or second place, and does not, if I may trust my own mind, attain even to the third.\"\n\nThe topic to discuss is: Is Pleasure the goal of life?\n\nAreas that could be of interest (not limited to these, so feel free to jump in)\n\n- If animals are devoted to pleasure, and Humans decide to devote themselves to pleasure, are humans reducing themselves to animals (\"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question\")\n\n- If pleasure is good for its own sake, do we have a right to judge another man's pleasure i.e. does the source of pleasure really matter?\n\n- Is there anything as a bad pleasure?\n\n- How does one persuade another that Epicureanism is better (pleasure wise) than Hedonism. If Epicureanism is about pleasures of simple things, and someone enjoys luxury, how can I explain to them that my pleasure is 'better' than their pleasure? \n\n- Does the mind possibly enhance pleasure? \n\nPlease feel free to add anything that struck you in reading the section. We don't have to discuss all these points, just whatever is fascinating to the group.",

In fact, Epicureanism may not have been original, since Plato was not a contemporary (he came before Epicurus), and some of the Epicurean arguments were already being debated while Plato lived. Or perhaps Epicureanism in its specific form came about as a response to Plato. Anyways, I am reading it now, so if anyone wants to read it as well, so we can discuss pleasures, I'm down.",

Diminish your artificial wants as much as possible, whether you are rich or poor ; for the\nrich man's, increasing by indulgence, are apt to outweigh even the abundance of his means; and the poor man's diminution of them renders his means the greater. On the other hand, increase all your natural and healthy enjoyments. Cultivate your afternoon fire-side, the\nsociety of your friends, the company of agreeable children, music, theatres, amusing books, an urbane and generous gallantry. He who\nthinks any innocent pastime foolish, has either to grow wiser or is past the ability to do so. In the one case, his notion of being childish is\nitself a childish notion. In the other, his importance is of so feeble and hollow a cast, that it dare not move for fear of tumbling to pieces.\"\n\nBasically healthy ways to spend your time. He also mentions exercise as well. Just wanted to share.",

I've also felt that, in a similar way, the highest happiness we could get from life is a peace of mind (absence from perturbation i.e. from maddening desires). \n\nBut I wonder whether part of the problem (or our attraction towards these maddening desires) is because we are bored. The reason we drink coke instead of water is because we want that sensation of pleasure from sugar because we are bored of water. Arts exist partly because we are bored. \n\nSo the question is: Does Epicurus have a remedy for Boredom? Is he suggesting that we just accept boredom (which is ironic coming from an alleged hedonist) Does he have any special insights into boredom that might be very relevant for someone living in this century.

        "text": "Quintus Horatius Flaccus, or simply Horace (65–8 B.C.), is often remembered and thought of as an intellectual and lover of both philosophy and poetry alike. While this remains true, it came to be that he eventually emerged through his works as an Epicurean. His works feature frequent elements from the Stoic, Peripatetic, and Platonic schools of thought; Epicureanism however is brought up more than twice as often in all of his works than the second most alluded to, Stoicism.\n\nToday, Horace is most notably remembered for being the first of all Latin poets to express the famous aphorism *carpe diem* in the eleventh poem of the first book of his *Odes* (c. 23 BC). In its literal meaning, the phrase means to “pluck the day [as it is ripe],” or, in other words, to enjoy the moment.\n\nToday, thanks to the many different forms of media, Horace’s original meaning has since been lost. More often than not, when someone shouts *carpe diem*, it is an excuse issued prologue to some irresponsible act in an attempt to justify it. When Horace expresses his actual sentiment however, it comes across as nearly the opposite:\n\n&gt;Ask not, Leuconoë (we cannot know), what end the gods have set for me, for thee, nor make trial of the Babylonian tables!^1 How much better to endure whatever comes, whether Jupiter allots us added winters or whether this is last, which now wears out the Tuscan Sea upon the barrier of the cliffs! Show wisdom! Busy thyself with household tasks; and since life is brief, cut short far-reaching hopes! Even while we speak, envious Time has sped. **Reap the harvest of to-day, putting as little trust as many be in the morrow!** (Horace, 1.11)\n\n&gt;1\\. *Babylonian tables*: Referring to the calculations of the Chaldaean astrologers.\n\nThe bolded text can alternatively be translated, “Seize the day, put very little trust in tomorrow (the future).” \n\nWhile initially, the sentiment may not appear Epicurean, due to the allusion to Jupiter and the notion of fate, I find that this comes across as Horace’s tendency to provide allegorical allusions for poetic effect, rather than something that expresses his philosophical tendencies. More importantly, the poet is attempting to discourage his friend, Leuconoë, from seeking astrologers and other such mystics who claim to be able to predict the future. Rather, it is best to act *right now*, during the present, to full effect, since you cannot predict the future as it has yet been determined. Best to act today and let the future worry about itself.\n\n---\n\nHorace. *The Odes and Epodes*. Trans. C. E. Bennett. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1914. Print.\n",

So how does a modern epicurean enjoy their life in a way that differs from the status quo in modern society.",

        "text": "Happy 20th! Each month on the 20th Epicureans would gather to celebrate the birthday of Epicurus. Each month on the 20th I'll post a larger theme for discussion. By stickying it to the front page it will remain visible all month. This means that you'll have time to consider questions and answers that may occur over the month. If you have any suggestions for future topics drop the mods a line.\n\nNow on to this month's theme... Stoicism and Epicureanism were rival philosophies in antiquity and still struggle against each other today. For instance /r/Epicureanism  has 176 subscribers and /r/Stoicism  has... more. Why is Stoicism seemingly more popular than Epicureanism?\n\nThis month's topic was suggested by /u/jumpstartation  along this quote from Epictetus' Discourses, a chapter entitled Against Epicurus:\n\n&gt; Even Epicurus recognizes that we're social beings by nature, but once he has placed our good in our bodily shell, he is no longer in a position to say anything that conflicts with that. For he maintains forcefully, besides, that we should neither admire nor accept anything that is cut off from the nature of the good, and rightly so.\nHow can we still be social beings, then, if we have no natural affection for our offspring? And why is it, Epicurus, that you seek to dissuade the wise person from rearing children? Why are you afraid that he'll suffer distress as a consequence? What does it matter to him, then, if a little mouse cries out in his house? No, Epicurus was well aware that as soon as one has a small child, it's no longer in our power not to love it and take care of it. For the same reason, he says, anyone who has any sense won't engage in public affairs either, because he knowns what a man in public life has to do. And in truth, if you want to live among human beings as though among flies, who is to prevent you? Yet even though he is well aware of this, he has the audacity to say that 'we shouldn't rear children'. But when a sheep doesn't abandon its own offspring, and neither does a wolf, will a human being abandon his? What do you want? That we should be as stupid as sheep? And yet they don't abandon their young. As savage as wolves? And yet they don't abandon their young. Come, who could be persuaded by what you say when he sees his little child in tears after having fallen to the ground? For my part, I think that even if your mother and father could have foreseen that you would say such things, they wouldn't have exposed you at birth!\n(Epictetus, 1.23)\n\n/u/jumpstartation also pointed out Epicurus' [Against the Epicureans and Academics.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D20) We'll use these two texts to start off the discussion. Are the charges Epicetus lays against Epicureans fair? How do we rebut them?\n",

        "text": "Epicurus, I believe, maintained that mental pleasures were better than physical pleasures. As someone who based his whole philosophy, i.e. *the goal* of life on pleasure, its important to assess his position on pleasure, especially his insights. I have observed both true in myself and in society that we have, generally speaking, a propensity for mental pleasures (passive) over physical pleasures. Mental pleasures would be something like the internet, movies, music etc. Physical pleasures would be something like sports, adventure, travel etc. Even  when we partake in physical pleasures we convert them to mental pleasures by taking photos, being an audience/critic, etc.\n\nThe cyreniacs believed that mental pleasures were no better than physical pleasures. In other words to have a balanced life, we should try and partake in both. \n\nWhat do you think, was Epicurus wrong/correct on the hierarchy of passive over active pleasures and why? What are some contemporary modern active pleasures that an epicurean living with a commune of friends can partake in?",
