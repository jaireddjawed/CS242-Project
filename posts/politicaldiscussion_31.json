Ron DeSantis](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/ron-desantis) (R) to postpone his presidential dreams until 2028, warning that a 2024 run would fracture the “MAGA movement.”\n\n“I think that Ron DeSantis is very smart,” Lara Trump told [Sky News](https://www.skynews.com.au/opinion/erin-molan/very-smart-lara-trump-encourages-ron-desantis-to-run-for-president-in-2028/video/66e0a69daa06b189fe170a0aeb11c750) host Erin Molan. “There will be a lot of opportunity for him in the future … to run for president.”\n\n[Lara Trump warns DeSantis not to run for president in 2024 | Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lara-trump-warns-desantis-not-to-run)\n\nSome have blamed Trump's endorsement of poor candidates for the GOP mid-term unexpected losses including candidates in gubernatorial races in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Illinois and Michigan who all lost convincingly as they struggled to develop a winning general election message. (In the Arizona governor’s race, election denier – and Trump endorsee – Kari Lake [trails](https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/results/governor?admin1=04&amp;election-data-id=2022-GG&amp;selected-election-data-id=2022-GG-AZ&amp;election-painting-mode=projection&amp;filter-key-races=false&amp;filter-flipped=false) and is expected to lose as well.\n\n[Analysis: Donald Trump said the Trumpiest thing possible about the election | CNN Politics](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/donald-trump-2022-election-midterms)\n\nSome mega donors are publicly stating they will support DeSantis if he runs against Trump.   Ken Griffin, the founder and CEO of hedge fund Citadel, [told Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/06/gop-megadonor-desantis-24-ken-griffin-00065274) in an interview published Sunday he would back Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) if he decides to run for president in 2024.\n\nThe expected announcement comes as Trump appears to be at “substantial risk” of criminal prosecution over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, [according to a new report](https://www.brookings.edu/research/second-edition-fulton-county-georgias-trump-investigation/) from the Brookings Institution.\n\nShortly before the scheduled event Trump sent out an alert: “I’m making a BIG ANNOUNCEMENT at Mar-a-Lago TODAY, which will be one of the greatest events in the history of America. This day will be remembered FOREVER, and I want YOU to be a part of it,” Trump said invoking Uncle Sam in an email that went out on Tuesday afternoon. He went on to ask followers to “HURRY and give $2 IMMEDIATELY.” \n\nRegardless of who runs against Trump during the primary, is Trump likely to capture the nomination, given his very loyal MAGA base even though it makes up only 1/3 of the Republican party?",
