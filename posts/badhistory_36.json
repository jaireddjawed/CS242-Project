        "text": "I'd like to say I'm being clever in the post title, but no that really is the headline of this article:\n\nhttp://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2015/03/25/burying-richard-iii-englands-last-post-apocalyptic-warlord/\n\nThis is an opinion piece published in the Reuters news service using the recent re-burying of Richard III to discuss the apparently \"post-apocalyptic\" nature of life in 15th century England. The writer is from the think tank \"Project for the Study of the 21st Century,\" why that enables him to comment on the 15th century is an open question. \n\nAnyway, the premise of the piece is that the Fall of Rome left western Europe in a post-apocalyptic state until around the time of the Tutors when the Renaissance started. This is an instance where I wish I knew more about the differences in quality of life between the Late Roman Era and the late 1400s, because I'm pretty sure a ton of this is wrong, but I don't know enough to point it out.\n\nBut I will point out the stuff I do know is wrong!\n\n\"This week, Britain finally buries — or rather reburies — the Dark Ages.\"\n\nEven if one were being especially generous with the outdated term \"Dark Ages,\" I don't think anyone would apply it to the late 1400s. \n\n\"In some ways, Richard was little more than a post-apocalyptic warlord, a leader operating in a rough, world where central authority was always on the brink of collapse.\"\n\nLike most post-apocalyptic warlords Richard III, was an efficient administrator who presided over various important economic and judicial reforms. If you will recall this is a central point of Road Warrior.\n\nAlso while there was a hell of a lot of political instability in pre-modern England (which would continue on into the rule of the Tudors and Stuarts making this a dumb point), I don't know that anyone was lusting for the political stability of the 400s, with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.\n\n\"The clash of Christianity with Islam could stop wars in Europe, powers uniting to take the Holy Land during the Crusades had proved that.\"\n\nYeah, because it isn't like the 3rd Crusade was immediately followed by a war between the Kings of France and England. The 4th Crusade, which sacked Constantinople, is also remembered fondly for the European stability it brought.\n\n\"Most local conflicts, however, were simply about power. It was, essentially, a “Game of Thrones” world.\"\n\nThis horrible infighting among nobles is contrasted by the nobility of the Roman Civil Wars, which were completely different and not at all struggles between the powerful for control.\n\n\" In Spain, Portugal and Italy the Renaissance was beginning to gain traction.\"\n\nI'm not an expert, but I think the Italian Renaissance began earlier than the late 1400s/early 1500s. \n\n\"In many ways, the work done by the archaeologists and forensic scientists who examined and identified Richard’s bones has further enshrined his death as the moment truly modern Anglo-Saxon history begins.\"\n\nSee the archeologists exhumed Richard's corpse and discovered that he dropped the super awesome item that allowed Henry VII to begin modernity. \n\nSeriously this has to be one of the most nonsensical statements in history I've ever read. How does discovering and identifying a body allow for a clean distinction between two different eras of history?\n\nThe rest of the piece is a wishy-washy mix of ruminating on the Shakespearean legend of the man and a celebration of how awesome modern archeology and science is (Le STEM anyone?). \n\nI hope you've enjoyed my analysis of this great piece of historic journalism, I apologize if I got anything wrong; we are far away from anything that could be reasonably called my area of expertise.\n\nEdit:I should possibly not misspell the names of dynasties",

        "author": "dokh",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/31h6mp/the_guardian_does_its_level_best_with_the_easter/",
        "text": "*This post is too long to be a response to the thread on [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/03/easter-pagan-symbolism), which was recently posted to /r/history/; it didn't fit in a comment, but man, that thing is really, really bad history.*\n\nEaster is about rebirth and renewal in Christianity, and gets its name from an Anglo-Saxon festival at about the same time of year, one which was likely also a celebration of new life (the current best guess being that it focused around a fertility goddess). The timing of Easter has a lot to do with the Jewish tradition of Passover, which celebrates renewal and the end of an era but is *not* about literal rebirth.\n\nNone of the symbolism of the modern Easter celebration is of Pagan origin. The vast majority of the things in this article are utter fiction. In order, let's look at every claim:\n\n - the death of a son is a pun on son\n - the cross represents the Southern Cross\n - Ishtar has something to do with Easter\n - Ishtar was hung from a stake\n - Horus is one of the oldest known resurrection myths\n - Horus was born on December 25\n - Mithras was also born on Christmas Day\n - The Sol Invictus and Mitrhaic cults were the same thing, or closely linked\n - Dionysus was also a resurrected god.\n - Cybele was celebrated in what is now the Vatican\n - Cybele's lover was seen as dying and being reborn every year\n - The spring celebration of Cybele involved three days beginning with the same timing as the death of Jesus\n - Easter sunrise services are obviously about Pagan solar worship\n - There is something Pagan about the fact that the date of Easter is governed by phases of the moon\n - Eostre was a Pagan goddess\n - Eostre's symbol was a hare, hence the Easter Bunny\n - Ancient cultures exchanged eggs\n - Hot cross buns come from a story in the Old Testament and are therefore somehow Pagan\n\nA couple of these assertions are true. Most aren't. From the start:\n\n - The son/sun pun doesn't even work in English until 500 years ago or so (they weren't pronounced the same before the Great Vowel Shift), and obviously the solar worship practiced in Rome involved the word *sol* while Christ was the *filius* (son) of God in early Christianity. These words are not remotely alike. Nor are their equivalents in Greek, the dominant language of the early Christian church. So no, it's not a pun.\n\n - The constellation of the southern cross was regarded in antiquity as part of Centaurus, not as a distinct cruciform constellation. It was then forgotten by Europeans (because the procession of Earth's orbit brought it below the southern horizon from Europe) and was regarded as cross-shaped on rediscovery, in 1455, by a Christian. Any symbolic connection comes from interpreting the constellation in light of the religion, not the other way around.\n\n - Although not asserted directly in the article, the phonetic similarity between \"Easter\" and \"Ishtar\" is the linchpin of a meme that circulates every spring that also advances a bunch of false claims about Sumerian religion. The Germanic languages actually derive their words for Easter from the name of an indigenous festival, probably *Austron in proto-Germanic and distantly related to the Latin *aurora* \"dawn\"; there is no connection to the unrelated languages of ancient Mesopotamia. (By the way: *Ostara, Jakob Grimm's reconstruction of the proto-Germanic word, has some currency in modern Paganism, but as a point of historical linguistics most of what Grimm came up with has since been superseded by modern scholars working from more data.)\n\n - Ishtar descended into the land of the dead, and returned; this is a common theme in ancient myth. Although I admit I'm not familiar with the primary sources from Mesopotamia, most secondary sources I've seen suggest she did this without herself dying, and do not mention hanging from a cross-like structure. This one might be true, though, since it could simply be missing from the sources I know; any specialists in that time and place about?\n\n - The worship of Horus changed a lot over the span of Egyptian history. Also, Horus didn't come back from the dead; he resurrected Osiris in most versions of the relevant myth. That said, yes, it's an ancient story of a god returning from the dead. Those are kind of everywhere, and nobody goes about claiming Lleu Llaw Gyffes is a ripoff of Osiris just because he also got killed and brought back by another god. (Although I'll note that whether Lleu Llaw Gyffes even got killed is a matter of debate among scholars.) I'll give this one half credit.\n\n - Irrelevant, since Horus is not a god with any particular parallel to Jesus even in the stories he plays a role in that feature a god returning from the dead. Also, Horus worship changed *a lot* over its history; blanket assertions about him other than \"yup, he sure was a god with a bird head\" are basically always wrong as across-the-board statements even if there exists a specific time and place at which this was believed.\n\n - Mithraism has a *ton* of parallels with Christianity, and most articles like this one mention more than just that one. However, very few of them are attested in the scant early sources on Mithraism, and most of its development happened after Christianity was already starting to gain followers; it's likely a lot of the ideas flowed from the Christian cult to the Mithraic rather than the other way around (though I'd be mildly surprised if there were *no* influence on Christianity from other important religions of the area).\n\n- Sol Invictus was a distinct mystery cult from the Mithraic cult, although many people were initiated into both. Mithras having strong solar associations (which, by the way, is not in any way a Jesus parallel; Christ is not a sun god), there was a bit of crossover in belief among followers that developed over time, but originally they were quite distinct. Sol invictus borrowed a lot less from Christianity than did Mithraism. By the way, the Sol Invictus cult did make a big deal out of the winter solstice as representing the rebirth of its god; this makes a good deal of sense, given that the winter solstice is when the days start lengthening again - it is the literal return of the literal sunlight. Christianity originally did not teach that Jesus was born on December 25, merely that this was a date chosen to celebrate the fact that he was born at all (and in fact there is a strong argument to be made that the Christian scriptures assume a springtime birth date), and Christmas is not in any way a celebration of Jesus being *re*born, unlike Saturnalia.\n\n - True, but given that the only other thing Dionysus has in common with Jesus is a fondness for wine, rather irrelevant.\n\n - *Gasp!* A Roman goddess was worshiped in *Rome?*\n\n - Yes, and Jesus very much isn't. Jesus died, once, and was resurrected, once; this fact is celebrated every year, but does not recur. This is, in fact, a major point of contrast between Christianity and many of the world's solar religions; the Jesus story is not in any way tied to anything cyclical.\n\n - Roman festivals had fixed dates in the Roman calendar. Good Friday meanders through the calendar at its whim, and does so according to rules that were not set down until well after the fall of Rome. The real correspondence here is that two major religions decided to have a celebration of a resurrection in the same *season*, which had a one in four chance of occurring even if we don't assume anything about the image of new life coming forth in the spring would have any influence on either.\n\n - Easter is about hope and coming out of the metaphorical darkness of the death of Jesus into \"the true light which illumineth all\" (John 1:9). The idea of marking that at sunrise is a logical one for Christians to innovate on their own, despite not being one demanded by the nature of the holiday.\n\n - Wait, Jews are Pagans now?\n\n - Nope! We have two sources for this idea. One is the fact that the Germanic languages, unlike the Romance languages which refer to Easter by a name derived from the Hebrew *Pesach* \"Passover\" (you know, the ancient pre-Christian religion that *actually* results in Easter coming just after the full moon every year), have a common origin for their names for the Easter festival. The other, from which this idea originates, is the Venerable Bede writing, several generations after Anglo-Saxon Paganism had died out, that the name given to the month in the (lunisolar) Anglo-Saxon calendar which contained the paschal full moon was *Eosturmonað* and that this derived from a goddess named *Eostre*. No other source backs him up on this; modern linguists agree that *Eostre* was the name of the Pagan holiday, not the goddess it celebrated (who is mentioned in precisely zero sources not deriving the idea from Bede). The current best guess is that, during the lunation that contains the paschal full moon, there was a holiday (most probably dedicated to Freo, the well-attested Anglo-Saxon equivalent of Freya, but nobody knows) which was called *Eostre*, and that other Germanic-speaking peoples also had a similar name for their own springtime festivals, as indicated by a more sensible interpretation of the linguistic data, and that in the century or so between Bede and his last ancestor who actually celebrated it, somebody conflated the goddess with the holiday. (The proto-Germanic word for these festivals, by the way, is clearly related to the word \"east,\" and both derive from the proto-Indo-European word for the dawn, appropriate to the returning spring celebrated by both Pagans and Christians this time of year.)\n\n - The first mention of hares in connection with Easter is in very late medieval Germany (ie, as a thing celebrated by people who had been Christian for nearly a millennium). It's old, it's a secular custom that has nothing to do with the religious meaning of Easter, but it's a custom attached from its beginnings to that Christian holiday. Given that the probably-ahistorical goddess Eostre is mentioned in *one sentence* of *one source*, nobody ever spelled out what her symbols were supposed to have been; there is quite simply no reason to imagine the hare was among them. There's a good guess for why a secular German custom involving bunnies might have arisen, though - they're celebrating new life right in the time of year when rabbits do even more than usual of what rabbits do best.\n\n - You'll note the lack of any mention in the article of any particular ancient culture that did this, which would allow us to compare that observance with the Christian custom of decorating eggs for Easter and see if the parallel might actually be a meaningful one.\n\n - Festive foods are a feature of most holidays invented by humans. Yes, it appears some were cooked in the Old Testament (by Jews, not Pagans). Gosh, I wonder how many times anyone ever thought of making a special bread.\n\nSeriously, the idea that both Christians and historical Pagans have chosen this time of year to celebrate renewal and rebirth is a valid one, and a meaningful way to remind yourself that there's something humans all share that makes us see in spring something worth celebrating (even if, from where I sit in NC, this Easter seems to be corresponding rather nicely with the start of the season when all things become yellow, an event which I can assure you fills very few people with joy). New life is coming forth, and we see in that our own potential for rebirth and second chances, and that is beautiful and reflects something in which we find truth regardless of our creed.\n\nThis article doesn't just say that, though - it uses a lot of bullshit to try to say something a lot more forceful, and a lot less true.",

I watched this on Dailymotion, so I am not entirely certain if I am allowed to paste a link here.\n\nSo I could have started on the first episode, but the opening line is “For thousands of years, the Ayoreo tribe has lived in the jungles of south America. They are still leading much the same hunter gatherer lifestyle as the very first humans on earth.” Now, for those who are not familiar, the Ayoreo are a classic example of semi-nomadic horticulturalists, planting beans and corn in seasons where mobility is not possible then ranging to hunt while the crops grow. Maize corn comes from northern Mexico and was domesticated maybe 5,000 years ago (it is super complicated) so clearly people at the dawn of time did not live so much like modern Amazonian tribal people. Also, the east African highlands where humans first appeared is pretty notably not jungle. Then we see a little reenactment of the meeting of a previously uncontacted Ayoreo band with a modern...researcher, maybe? in a shipping container. Survival International has compiled actual oral history of the event, which is a bit more complicated given that the “contacter” was a bulldozer. Anyway, that's about a minute of video and two sentences so let's just move on to:\n\nEPISODE TWO AGE OF EMPIRE\n\nhow do you turn this on\n\nSo this documentary series is apparently another one of the hilarious quixotic attempts journalists and related creatures make to sum up the history of the world. Our host today is Andrew Marr, a BBC reporter with an uncanny resemblance to Tony Abbot who I will be referring to as Bizarro Michael Wood. Where Michael Wood treats his subjects with humanity and genuine enthusiasm, Bizarro Michael Wood seems to treat them with smarmy British cynicism. Where Michael Wood takes each subject on its own terms,  Bizarro Michael Wood is crafting a grand narrative proceeding from the Olduvai Gorge to overambitious yet oddly lazy BBC productions. Where Michael Wood eschews cheesy reenactments in favor of conversations with locals and house tours, Bizarro Michael Wood seems to have the budget of a reasonably exciting Game of Thrones episode. Where Michael Wood has a full head of rather impressive hair, Bizarro Michael Wood is balding. And so on.\n\nIn fact, you should really just watch Michael Wood's Story of England, it is delightful. Anyway.\n\nThe scene opens in the palace of Ninnevah, where we meet one of the “earliest great empire builders”: Sennacherib!\n\nAlthough I should point out that Sennacherib, while a great conqueror, was not really an empire builder—that distinction more rightfully belongs to Tiglath Pilessar III, the first great king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The prefix “Neo” is used advisedly, as there had been great conquerors before TP3, and of course the earliest empires are generally considered  to be those of Sargon of Akkad and Narmar of Egypt, both a couple thousand years earlier. Neither were mentioned in the Bible, though.\n\nAlso, Bizarro Michael Wood just used the phrase “look under the eyeliner” (I do not know of any evidence that Assyrian kings wore eyeliner) and described Sennacherib as the “original empire building maniac”. This is going to be more difficult than I thought.\n\nWhat follows is a typical description of Neo-Assyrian brutality, which /u/farquier can respond to better than I. It is worth noting, however, that the most flamboyantly gruesome descriptions are not those who resisted conquest, but those who rebelled and insulted the god Ashur. The policy of deportation is also seriously misrepresented: the deportees were just that—mass populations deported from one region to another. This must have caused untold human misery but was not mass slavery. The idea was to break up quarrelsome populations, not create pools of enslaved labor. In fact, economic historian Walter Scheidel has theorized that systems of mass chattel slavery only really exist in market economies—the argument is way more complicated, but that is that.\n\n6:40 in and Bizarro Michael Wood just claimed the “ruthless warmongers” (read: the Assyrians) left little trace on this world. He then goes on the claim that the Phoenician alphabet is the first phonetic system of writing. I am not entirely undistressed. To lessen my distress, I will nitpick: the ship shown as the standing for Phoenician traders is very obviously a Greek trireme. Triremes are warships, narrow and shallow drafted with many banks of oars. All three of those traits are very bad for a merchant vessel. Second nitpick: the Assyrians were not followed by the Persians, they were followed by the Babylonians. This is on Wikipedia, not very hard guys.\n\nAt this point he talks about the Persians, and it is pretty bad. I'm not writing anything else until we leave the Middle East, because Bizarro Michael Wood does not have the maturity to discuss the subject. I will quickly note that the ruins of Sardis (the capital of Croesus) that are implied to be from this time are very obviously Hellenistic at the earliest. You know the three classical orders of Doric, Ionic and Corinthian? The column bases shown are Ionic, which really grew in popularity during the Hellenistic. I leave the topic.\n\n[12:50]: OK I lied because he just said some stupid goldbug bullshit about coinage. He claims the Lydians were the first people to produce coins to a reliable standard: is this true? Maybe? I believe the earliest coins found are from them. But beyond that, is that what the achievement of coinage was? Absolutely not. Even in Roman times, which had a far more stable currency system than anyone previous, scales to weigh coins and test purity were common. The innovation of coinage is the political ideology behind them, the face of the ruler staring up at you every time you want to buy something. Standard weights and measures are as old as the first time a guy held up one thing and compared the weight to another things. Goddamn it Bizarro Michael Wood.\n\nAlso holy shit Cyrus is literally played by a blue eyed white guy. And I cannot tell how ironic the shade being thrown on Herodotus is.\n\nTwenty minutes in, and he shifted to India. Following smarmy British geography (EDIT: Sorry to all British people but this video is making me feel really anti-British. Has nothing to do with you. Maybe send me some Sharp's Doom Bar to make up for it?), he will be visiting China next, I guess (EDIT: It turns out I was wrong. Yay?). This will not be easy, as he opens up his India section by saying that India was a strictly caste system, and at the top were people like Siddatha Gautema. Now to begin, the caste system only really developed in the middle first millennium CE (it's complicated) and only solidified under Muslim and especially British rule. Even if that were not the case, Gautema Buddha was born in a *gana-sanga* which were seemingly not as hierarchical. Even if that were not the case he was probably *kshetriya*, although I don't know of any explicit *varna* designation, and not *brahman* which are “at the top” of the *varna* system. Anyway. I am literally unable to tell whether Bizarro Michael Wood is pronouncing “Siddartha” at “Sit Heart Ah” as a parody of bad British pronunciations. Maybe the whole thing is satire?\n\n[27:00] Aside from this, the description of Buddhism's foundation was...unterrible? Gautema Budha's journey is one that has taken something of a hold in the Western imagination, so Bizarro Michael Wood didn't need to do much more than repeat a well worn message, but sure, I'll take it. Granted, Gautema's teachings were not the first of their kind, as Jainist teaching came earlier and Buddhism draws heavily from the Uppanishands, but sure, I'll take it. Let's go to the Greeks.\n\n[28:00] Well, literally everything he just said about the birth of Athenian democracy was wrong. He claims it was born from a popular revolt centering on the Acropolis. This is wrong. Instead of dealing with that, I will just say how it actually begun: First there was Solon. Solon created a set of more or less universal law codes but most importantly decreed that no citizen can be enslaved. This created a sense of communal mass membership. Solon left, then Peisistratus became tyrant based on supporting the grievances of the poorer citizens against the rich. He essentially refocused a great deal of Attic identity from local Attic communities onto the Acropolis of Athens through a very complicated process. He died, stuff happened, the Spartans eventually kicked his son out. Then Cleisthenes came into the scene and started true democratic movements and giving real power to the masses. Democracy happens. Ignore what Bizarro Michael Wood says on the topic it is literally wrong in every detail.\n\n[28:45] DOGGIE EDIT: [doggie](http://i.imgur.com/vJ261RI.jpg?1)\n\nAnyway, so we now begin the Battle of Marathon, which is not very well described. I will point out a single error: Bizarro Michael Wood says that no Greek army had ever defeated a Persian army. In fact, Darius' invasion of the Aegean was largely motivated by the Athenian assistance in the Ionian Revolt against the Persians, which led to the burning of Sardis before the Persians counter attacked. Now, it is very difficult to sack Sardis without winning a single battle, so yes, Bizarro Michael Wood is blatantly wrong. He also manages to mispronounce Miltiades' name. It is pronounced Mil-TI-ah-des, while Bizarro Michael Wood pronounces it Mil-ti-AH-des. I mean for goodness sake.\n\nHe then claims that the entire Athenian army ran back to Athens, giving the name to the Marathon. In reality, the runner from the battlefield was a single person named Phidippides. It is a very famous story. What the heck?\n\nOh god he has got to China I'm scared.\n\nHe just said that the Chinese name for Confucius is Kong-tzu. In reality, his Chinese name is Kong Fuzi. I do not know how he made this mistake. I am beginning to feel great hatred in my heart for /u/Dirish, who told me about this series. After making this rather odd mistake, Bizarro Michael Wood makes it very clear he has not actually read Confucius' writings. He basically claims that proper rites were equivalent to good moral behavior. Confucius is far more complex than that, rather he views the rites as a means to an end, and that the proper performance of rites will create virtuous habits. It gets a bit more complicated than that but my god The Analects are about a hundred pages long why would he not just read them? Is he that lazy?\n\nIt is worth noting that while talking about Confucius clips of people doing Tai Chi flash up. Tai Chi is really not very Confucian—Taoism, and its syntheses with Buddhism were more important. But it is pretty distinctly Chinese, which I suppose makes it suitable to flash up now? I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. Let's go to Alexander. He stages Alexander's blatant murder of Cleitus as some sort of drunken brawl. He says nothing else interesting about Alexander or anything able to be commented upon.\n\nI was going to wait until the end, but I just want to note that the person they cast to play Alexander is lily white with Elvis sideburns. It is absolutely ridiculous and super duper racist. I am most of a bottle of wine in and getting less charitable, so yes, here is another difference between Michael Wood and Bizarro Michael Wood: the former is respectful of all cultures, while the latter is a racist.\n\nHe's now talking about Socrates and I will be damned if I say anything about it. I can describe the context of his philosophy if anyone wants, but I will not do Bizarro Michael Wood the honor.\n\nI'm not saying anything because the smug conservative bastard is looking particularly smug when talking about censorship.\n\nI will treat it as a mercy that I will not be seeing his discussion about the Romans, although I am somewhat curious how, exactly, Bizarro Michael Wood would fuck that up. Maybe I will find out. Not tonight.\n\nI rate this documentary one empty bottle of wine out of one full one. I hate you /u/Dirish.",

        "text": "Hey, first time posting here! Hopefully I won't let you down. \n\nAccording to /u/srhrshrshs,\n\n&gt; Uh no. That the GIs were torturing, mutilating and killing japanese prisoners was a well known phenomenon all over the world...\n\n&gt; The pacific war is a very interesting theatre of war that gets overlooked because we behaved like nazis so we tried to sweep it under the rug. We were engaging in a race war against the japanese. Even the nazis were horrified at our base depravity. **Pretty much every japanese that surrendered were tortured to death, were mutilated and their body parts sent home to family/girlfriends as war trophies.** If you go look at the war stats in the pacific, there are pretty much no wounded and POW japanese. The casualty list is pretty much all dead. That's because the GIs would go around and bayonet/shoot wounded japanese. NO PRISONER POLICY.\n\n&gt; The japanese used to surrender to the allies early on but stopped surrendering when they saw our depraved behavior towards them.\n\nI received [this reply](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3125lv/a_us_marine_approaches_a_japanese_soldier_on_iwo/cpyidm0) on a post I made on /r/pics about the first Marine experiences with the Japanese in WWII. Basically, I had made the point that the American fear of taking prisoners really began after the first Battle of the Tenaru on Guadalcanal, which was more or less the first real victory the Marines had experienced. I had explained that after the battle, Marines went out to search the bodies of the dead Japanese, and [several were killed or wounded](http://www.pacificwrecks.com/provinces/solomons_tenaru.html) by Japanese with grenades or small pistols who laid among the bodies of their dead comrades. After this point, the Marines began to bayonet any Japanese bodies they came across to prevent this from happening again, and for the rest of the Pacific theater, Marines were generally very wary of any Japanese who were wounded or were trying to surrender. This practice of perfidy on the part of the Japanese continued to occur throughout the war.\n\nSecondly, the whole mutilation of the war dead that he was speaking of was definitely brutal, but it was for the most part done to soldiers that were already dead. This practice also had its roots in the early stages of the Guadalcanal campaign, where pictures of Americans mutilated at Wake Island were found in the possession of a dead Japanese soldier. Yes, GIs did mutilate dead Japanese in barbaric ways, and in some instances, yes, they did do things like remove gold crowns while a dying soldier was still alive, but by no means did they systematically torture and mutilate every single Japanese soldier who surrendered. On the contrary actually, the US even [encouraged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_prisoners_of_war_in_World_War_II#Allied_attitudes) GI's to take Japanese prisoners whenever possible, and it was actually somewhat successful, as prisoner taking rates increased in 1944 and 45. \n\n[The Allies also held Japanese POWs in camps that were up to the standard of the Geneva Convention.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_prisoners_of_war_in_World_War_II#Allied_prisoner_of_war_camps) In fact, when the Allies found out how terribly their soldiers were being treated in Japanese POW camps, they tried very hard to show Japan that their prisoners were being treated well in order to win better treatment for Allied prisoners. It didn't work at all, but there was a conscious effort on behalf of the Allied governments to treat Japanese prisoners as well as any other POWs. \n\nFurther down in the thread, there were also a few other instances of Bad History from /u/srhrshrshs:\n\n&gt; Uh no. The japanese started their suicide tactics because of US brutality...\n\nand when called out about those tactics predating the US involvement in the war, \n\n&gt; No they didn't. The myth of the unsurrendering super-alien japanese didn't start until US involvement. The japanese didn't employ suicide tactics against the chinese, russians, koreans, etc. The japanese never employed kamikazes against anyone but the US.\n&gt; The japanese surrendered to the russians a few years prior to US involvement. Mmmmkay? \n\nWell, there are a lot of reasons that the Kamikazes were primarily employed against US ships, but mostly because it was US ships that were the biggest threat at that moment.\n\n&gt; The banzai charges were just human wave attacks. It's the tactic the chinese used against the US in the korean war. Mmmmkay? These tactics are what the germans and the russians used. Hell these types of charges were common place in WW1. Mmmmkay? It's a tad bit different than kamikaze attacks or\n\nNo, Banzai attacks are actually quite different than a human wave attack. A human wave attack has some expectation of survival, even if it's minimal, and the attacks that the Russians and Chinese used were forced, and there was expectation or hope that some would survive to occupy the position they were attacking. And when did the Germans ever use human wave attacks? The Japanese Banzai attacks were a last hurrah before complete defeat, with the idea of trying to kill as many of the enemy as possible before death. They were viewed as a form of [gyokusai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzai_charge), or honorable suicide. \n\nIn conclusion, no, the Japanese hero death idea was not revisionist history, the Japanese tendency to not surrender was real, and while the Allies often did kill Japanese who were wounded or trying to surrender, it was because the Japanese often faked surrender in order to kill more. There was not systematic torture, mutilation of Japanese who tried to surrender, and those that did were actually treated quite well. ",

        "text": "Some bad Revolutionary War history from the 19th century that's been carried into the 21st century. First to set the stage:\n\nDon Troiani painted [this](https://41.media.tumblr.com/656039bae8a4434ad04cf620871a02be/tumblr_nm5burxIQd1tseacco1_540.jpg) piece which he titled **Departure Of The Minutemen - Westford Responds, April 19, 1775**.^1\n\nThe print is available from [here](http://www.terryjamesart.com/product.aspx?sku=445), and the site includes a bit of flavor text to explain the image:\n\n&gt;In the pre-dawn hours of April 19th, 1775 an alarm was spreading through the Massachusetts countryside that British regulars were on the march towards Concord. As the word reached Westford and the other surrounding towns, men grasped their muskets and swords, said goodbye to their loved ones, and rushed to the call to arms. In advance of the rest of the Town of Westford's Minutemen and Militia companies, three men left that morning on horseback for the ten mile trek to Concord. Sgt. Joshua Parker said goodbye to his wife Hannah, while his three children Joshua Jr., Mary, and Patty, awoken by the commotion looked on, probably not understanding the gravity of what was to come. All three men said goodbye and rode off, not knowing if or when they would return, or that they would be witness to great events soon to come that day in Concord, and along the road back to Boston.\n\nSo where did Troiania get his information about three riders, and how did the site know to name one of them Joshua Parker? The answer is in a 19th century history of Westford titled *“The History of the Town of Westford”* (published in 1883). In it the author makes this statement about the fighting at North Bridge:\n\n&gt;Among those early on the field from the neighboring towns, was Lieutenant-Colonel John Robinson, of Westford. He was accompanied by the Rev. Joseph Thaxter, Captain Joshua Parker, and private Oliver Hildreth\n\nWestford is a town that's about 10 miles to the northwest of Concord. The town sent a total of three militia companies to join the fighting on April 19th. One was a minute company of 58 men. This was the desired full complement based on the reorganization proposed by the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. \n\nThey also sent two smaller companies, each around 35 men or so, for a total of 130 men.^2\n\nThe minute company was almost 1/2 the total strength of the Westford militia contingent, which makes me think that there were likely many men who had not responded to the alarm by the time the companies left. Based on the muster roll of April 19th, 1775, it appears likely that the minute company was quickly gathered (there had been a false warning just a few days earlier, so perhaps they were expecting this alert) and then sent off, with the other two companies leaving as soon as enough men had gathered.^3\n\nWe have the muster rolls for almost every unit that fought on April 19th, 1775 (I think there might be only three or four companies which didn't submit muster rolls), and those rolls list the names of every man who mustered. Some key things to point out about the 19th century information:\n\n* There's no Joshua Parker listed as Captain of any Westford militia unit. There *is* a Joshua Parker who was a sergeant in the minute company. This same Joshua Parker was elected lieutenant of the minute company and then later captain. \n\n* There's no Oliver Hildreth listed on the rolls at all. There are five other Hildreth's listed though, so it's apparent that the Hildreth's were a Westford family. \n\n* There are several witnesses to Lt. Colonel Robinson being there--most note that he declined the command of the militia at North Bridge, even though he had the authority as the senior ranking militia member. Instead Major Buttrick kept the command. \n\n* There are also references to Rev Thaxter. I couldn't find anything regarding Joshua Parker, but that's not surprising. \n\nThe only reference to Oliver Hildreth was this 19th century account, which also stated that Hildreth fought under Captain Henry Farwell. Once again we run into the problem of there being no Captain Henry Farwell on the Westford muster rolls.\n\nHowever, there *is* a Farwell who was a militia captain in Groton, which is about 10 miles west of Westford. And there's a family genealogy/history of the Hildeth's which states that Oliver Hildeth settled in Townsend, which is a few miles beyond Groton. \n\nLooking at the muster roll for the Groton militia companies shows us the names of both Captain Farwell and of Oliver Hildeth as having marched on April 19th, 1775. However a town history of Groton points out that they were too late to join the fighting on the 19th and encamped in Lexington before joining the siege of Boston. \n\nSo why did this legend of Oliver Hildeth fighting at North Bridge make it into the history of Westford (a town that he didn't even live in at the time)? Some possible answers:\n\n* Oliver was visiting family in Westford and mustered early since he wasn't in a Westford militia unit. But then why count him as fighting with a different captain and not a Westford captain?\n\n* Oliver somehow got word of the fighting earlier than anyone else in Groton (despite living to the west) and took off without waiting for anyone else to join him. Other men and groups of men did depart on their own without mustering with their units, so this is possible. But how did he manage to get the word so early as a mere private? And why leave without any other men? And if he did this why would he be counted as being a Westford man and not a Groton man? \n\n* Oliver Hildreth was confused with some other Hildreth who *was* there early. This is always possible, but if this is what happened I don't know of any way to prove it.\n\nI think the most likely answer is the old standby of memory drift. The Hildreth family talks about how their ancestor fought at Concord on April 19th, 1775. The muster rolls indicate that Oliver Hildreth *did* march on that day. Someone else knows that the Hildreths were a Westford family and puts Oliver Hildreth in with the Westford militia. Someone else notices that Oliver didn't fight under the same captain as the rest of the militia and maybe thinks \"Well, I know that some Westford men got there early. Oliver isn't listed on the muster rolls of the rest of Westford, but he did fight at Concord that day, so it makes sense that he must have been one of those men from Westford who arrived early.\"\n\nThen a 19th century historian starts doing research and gathering local lore and learns of Westford men who fought at North Bridge, among them one Oliver Hildreth. \n\nThen later historians incorporate the story into their works on the period--maybe being vague about names, but talking about the Westford men who left early. Then someone like Don Troiani comes along who reads these early accounts and thinks that it would make a great subject for a painting. \n\n1.) I love Troiani's work. His paintings are detailed and accurate. He also takes care to mention what year of the war his figures are supposed to represent.\n\n2.) The Massachusetts Provincial Congress had suggested that 1/4th to 1/3rd of the best men in each town's militia be drafted into a minute company.  Generally speaking there weren't militia rolls for a town as it was expected that all able bodied men between the ages of 15 and 50 serve. The muster rolls are records of men who showed up to fight in particular engagements, and the amount of time they served. These rolls were gathered so that the men could be properly paid for their service.\n\n3.) David Hackett Fischer in *Paul Revere's Ride* also notes two different occasions when Westford militia joined the fighting--once just south of Concord when the pursuit truly began, and again in conjunction with units from other towns at Bloody Angle.

        "text": "http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/30x8gi/arizona_state_university_professor_under_fire_for/cpwxdsx\n\n&gt;This is what happens to every civilization once they reach this level of prosperity.\n\n&gt;It's the last age, called \"The Age of Decadence\". Where people have it so good that they get riled up about things that don't matter in day to day survival.\n\n&gt;No civilization has made it past this age. You can only be tolerant towards so many things until you run out of things to be tolerant towards. Also, one of the things that marks the Age of Decadence is a tolerance of foreigners. So eventually the foreigners either attack and destroy the civilization or flood it and end up destroying it from the inside.\n\nR5: Many political orders survive the presence and toleration of foreign residents. Some even depended on these people for survival.\n\nRome is commonly given as the classic example of a civilisation that collapsed because of immigration. [However](http://openborders.info/blog/america-the-roman-empire-and-barbarian-invasions/):\n\n&gt;At any rate, peaceful German migrants were never a problem. On the contrary, the last greater defender of Rome was one of them: Stilicho, son a Vandal father, whose impressive campaigns thwarted Alaric the Visigoth for many years, before Stilicho’s murder paved the way for Alaric’s sack of Rome in 410 AD. Wikipedia mentions Stilicho’s “mostly barbarian troops” in his campaigns against Alaric in Illyria, and that he scraped together “a coalition of Romans, Alans, and Huns to defeat Radagasius at Ticinum in 406.” Stilicho managed to fight as far away as Britain, yet Rome fell in AD 410. \n\n&gt;What happened? Well, not only was Stilicho himself murdered– and Rome had no comparable general– but “in the disturbances which followed the downfall and execution of Stilicho, the wives and children of barbarian foederati throughout Italy were slain by the local Romans.” Naturally, then, some of those barbarian soldiers joined Alaric, and Rome could offer hardly any resistance to Alaric. I’m not sure whether much is known about this “thoroughly co-ordinated coup d’état organized by Stilicho’s political opponents,” but one wonders, especially given this ethnic cleansing aspect… might it have been planned and carried out by nasty Roman nativists, the 5th-century counterparts of Tom Tancredo and Russell Pearce. **In short, it looks like Rome fell because nativist know-nothings murdered a talented immigrant general and his immigrant troops, who were doing the jobs Romans wouldn’t do, namely, defend Rome.** (emphasis added)\n\nOthers cite indigenous societies like American Indians, Canadian First Nations, or Australian Aborigines. [However](http://openborders.info/blog/abe-lincoln-would-be-a-russian-now/), colonisation and hostile invasion is clearly not the same thing as peaceful immigration:\n\n&gt;  To say the entry of “foreigners” to the US, Brazil, Australia, etc. has been unfortunate for the native aboriginal peoples is a great understatement. But what marked the entry of foreigners to these countries in the centuries leading up to the 19th century? An immense government conspiracy to colonise these places, which largely lacked any significant government to resist the foreign conspirators — and near-global acceptance of governments’ moral rights to implement such conspiracies.\n\n&gt;Is there anywhere in the world today where such conditions exist? If there is such a place, it quite clearly isn’t any of the OECD countries, where strong governments exist, and it is accepted that any government conspiracy to colonise another country would constitute an act of war.\n\nOthers say Texas, which Mexico lost as a state supposedly due to the immigration of white Anglo-Saxons, is an example of how immigration undermines political sovereignty. [Except](http://openborders.info/blog/abe-lincoln-would-be-a-russian-now/) that Texan immigration was more like Mexican-sponsored Anglo-Saxon colonisation -- and the ultimate reason Texas seceded still had more to do with the intrigues of Mexican federal politics than any active conspiracy to subvert the established political order via immigration:\n\n&gt; There was a government conspiracy to subsidise immigration to Texas and introduce foreigners to that place — and this conspiracy was run by none other than the Mexican government. Mexico did not merely allow anyone to cross its borders: it allowed anyone who wanted to to just settle in its territory and claim land. The authorities over Texas specifically allowed anyone to claim one square league (4,438 acres) of irrigable land. The Mexican government specifically authorised Stephen Austin’s colony in Texas, granted him more land for his settlers, and made him a virtual dictator over the colony there, allowing him to import the English common law and permit slavery [contrary to Mexican national law].\n\n&gt;Texas later revolted after the political turmoil in Mexico led to the establishment of a government which rejected federalism altogether. Besides the immense 19th-century issue of slavery, Texas had been governed as part of another Mexican state; they had long agitated for a state of their own in Mexico. The centralist Santa Anna government finally rejected these demands, triggering Austin’s decision to call for secession, and thus the Texan Revolution. The same centralist policies simultaneously triggered the secession and creation of the Republic of Yucatan, the Republica del Rio Grande, and an independent Tabasco.\n\nFinally, the ultimate counter-example: [Ben Franklin once worried about swarthy, criminal, uneducated immigrants swarming his country and taking over](http://openborders.info/blog/worried-about-hispanic-immigration-to-the-us/). So what happened? [Well](http://openborders.info/blog/did-open-borders-change-the-course-of-world-history/):\n\n&gt;Suppose all immigration of Germans to America had been blocked from the start. Restrictionists would have had lots of arguments on their side: Germany was a hotbed of various collectivist ideologies that were inimical to American liberty: rabid Nationalism, Antisemitism, Communism, and National Socialism. IQ of German Americans is at best average. German immigrants only slowly assimilated and kept speaking German. And then alien habits like minors can drink beer. Etc.\n\n&gt;Now let’s go back to 1940.\n\n&gt; Forget about General Eisenhower, and get used to Generalfeldmarschall Eisenhauer. Same for Chester Nimitz for the Navy (now: Generaladmiral Nimitz) and Carl Andrew Spaatz for the Air Force (now: Generalfeldmarschall Karl Andreas Spatz).\n\nIn short, the claim that tolerance of peaceful foreign presence leads to the downfall of your political order, let alone civilisation itself, is hogwash. While you can debate specific claims about the character of immigration over the course of human history, and debate the appropriate inferences to draw from that, you can't claim with a straight face that history suggests tolerance of foreigners leads to the downfall of human civilisation.",

We all know the \"genohoax\" was just an excuse for Aang to sieze land for \"Republic City\" from the Earth Kingdom. The fire nation never actually killed any air benders, they fled, you guessed it, into the AIR. When Aang murdered Ozai, he fulfilled his promise to his people and built them a city on stolen land.\nThat's right, the Air Nomads aren't nomads anymore, they're living right here in Republic City! Our so called President is nothing more than a shape changing sky bison! Wake up badger-sheeple!\n\nThis is wrong for several reasons:\n\nFirst, Aang did not \"seize\" the land for Republic City, but founded the city on an illegitimate colony of the Fire Nation in a sovereign state, and he had the support of the Earth Kingdom government (or at least what was left of it).  Furthermore, even if the argument that the land technically belonged to the Fire Nation can be made, the ruling Fire Lord, Lord Zuko, was a co-founder of the city.\n\nFurthermore, the Air Benders could not fly, merely glide.

        "text": "I'm aware that Civ V isn't necessarily a bastion of good history. I've talked about language before, and a few other examples of bad history popped up in the comments of that thread. Today, though, there's something more blatant than me and my semantics. Something more sinister. I'm talking, of course, about [this](http://kingofathousandworlds.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/sejong-opening-screen.jpg). It's not terribly wrong, but there's something that sticks out at me. Something very, very wrong. I'm talking about the claim that Hangul was \"Korea's first written language\" and that it brought \"the light of literature and science to the masses after centuries of literary darkness.\" It's a funny kind of bad history, because honestly, I'm not even sure where this idea comes from. \n\nTo really demonstrate why this is wrong, I want you to go and google literally any Korean traditional thing you can think of. Kimchi, hanbok, Seoul, even Sejong himself. Click the Wikipedia page for it. You'll notice throughout the Wikipedia page that there are three different versions of the Korean word, one being the transliterated Latin text, the next being Hangul, and the third being Hanja. Hanja looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/iploE31.jpg), though usually, it will have more strokes than that. \n\nThis, of course, does not look like what we ordinarily associate with Korean writing, which might be something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/mEaL0Cx.jpg). That would be because we're looking at two different writing systems - the one in this paragraph is Hangul, and the one in the previous paragraph is Hanja. Why do I bring this up? Well, there's a difference between the two. Civ V isn't wrong to say that Sejong invented Hangul, but it is wrong to say there was nothing before it. That's where Hanja comes in.\n\nHanja - and, to be more correct, Hanmun, which are complete phrases written in Hanja rather than the individual characters - was derived from Chinese characters, and represents an adoption of those Chinese characters in order to write the Korean language. It's no different from the adoption of the Latin alphabet to write French or German, just as an analogy. The introduction and use of Hanja came part and parcel with the introduction of Buddhism and the establishment of Han dynasty outposts in northern Korea between the first century BCE and the 4th century CE. While we don't know exactly when Hanja was introduced and was popularised, we do know that in the 4th century, Buddhism was introduced and gradually absorbed Korean shamanistic traditions (though there's evidence it was introduced earlier in some parts of Korea). With Buddhist texts came Chinese characters and the need to create liturgical texts that were Korean. \n\nOf course, there's a difference between pointing out that there was a written Korean language before Hangul - and indeed after Hangul's invention, though I'll get to that more thoroughly in a minute - and saying there was no literature or science. It's well worth noting that one problem that scholars of Korean language encounter is that, if they're studying anything written before the 20th century, it's likely written in Hanja. This includes great works of Korean literature, such as the *Samguk Yusa* (written in the 1280s), *Geumo Sinhwa* (written in the 15th century), or the *Thousand Character Classic*, which is Chinese, but also a fundamental part of Korean history as well. All of this implies that there probably was a literary tradition prior to the introduction of Hangul. Most likely.\n\nWhat must be emphasised, though, is the history of Hangul itself. Even beyond the history of its creation and the fact that Hanja did exist before it, it wasn't as though Hangul was invented and then universally adopted. It faced staunch opposition after it was introduced, especially from elites such as Choe Manri who saw it as inferior to Hanja, and this opposition led to it being banned in 1504. However, it was more popular among commoners and among those who would not have been able to take the government tests which required a knowledge of Hanja. It became especially popular as a means to write novels, and the genre of Hangul novels flourished. \n\nHowever, it's not until the end of the Joseon dynasty in the 19th century that Hangul became universally popular, and then, that was only because of its association with Korean nationalism in the face of occupation and invasion. Hangul and the Korean-ness of it became a rallying cry for Korean nationalists, especially with the ban on the Korean language in 1938. Even then, though, a mixed Hangul-Hanja system remained part of the education system until the 1970s when increased industrialisation and government intervention led to Hangul being more and more the sole way of writing, at least in the South. In the North, Hanja was banned completely in 1949. \n\nMy point here is that it's inaccurate to say that Hangul was Korea's first alphabet. It wasn't. It was pretty cool, and I'm not intending to downplay its history, but Hanja is also a part of Korean history. A very, very difficult to read part of Korean history.",

        "text": "So my World Civ II professor is just mired in misconception. In her own words, she teaches from her own memory, not the book. Some of the more egregious mistakes she's made include (paraphrased):\n\n1. Edward VI and Bloody Mary never existed. When Henry VIII died, his daughter by Catherine of Aragon, Mary, was given the throne of Scotland so she could be a Catholic queen, while her half-sister Elizabeth was given the throne of England. \n\n2. The Great Migrations were perpetrated by the \"Holy Roman Empire, a confederation of Germans\" who conquered the waning Roman Empire.\n\n3. After the Roman Empire fell, the Catholic Church was the only religious authority for the Christians (when a student brings up Eastern Orthodoxy she fails to mention the East--West Schism and claims that Eastern Orthodoxy is a later development and does not exist until after the Middle Ages).\n\n4. Marco Polo brought pasta back from China, and suggested the Italians use tomato to garnish it.\n\n5. George III was an absolute monarch. \n\nBefore I get into R5, just by looking at these problems you can see how Eurocentric this 'World History' course is. The course is half over and we have not so much as touched on anything outside of Europe with the exception of an occasional mention of China. This is not necessarily the professor's fault but something is definitely wrong with the curriculum. Can anyone who has taken World Civ II anywhere else in the US attest to a more 'world' focused curriculum? My World Civ I class, while base and not very detailed, covered most of the world. \n\nNow for R5:\n\n1. At the time of Henry VIII's death, he had a male heir to succeed him, [Edward VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VI_of_England). When Edward died young, Mary, having been raised Catholic despite her father's schism from the Church, [became queen, and quickly tried to reverse the damage her father had done to Catholicism in England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_I_of_England). Meanwhile, the reigning family of England, the Tudors, had almost nothing to do with the reigning dynasty in Scotland, the Stuarts, save for a marriage between a [daughter of Henry VII and James IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Tudor). [Mary, Queen of Scots, while she reigned simultaneously with Elizabeth, was from the House of Stuart and certainly not the daughter of Henry VIII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_Queen_of_Scots). \n\n2. The Holy Roman Empire, as the name would suggest, was named after the Roman Empire, and claimed to be its successor. It was [founded in the wake of the Great Migrations, and had no hand in the fall of the Roman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire). I can't imagine how someone would confuse this.\n\n3. The idea that the Catholic Church was the sole religious authority for **European** Christians before the 12th century is not necessarily incorrect. But we, today, identify the Catholic Church as headed by the Pope and as the oldest church of Western Christianity. Before the High Middle Ages, the Church was effectively unified, despite differences in liturgy and disputes over the supremacy of the Pope. The Church split into what we now identify as the [Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches in the 11th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism). Depending on who you ask, either the Catholic or the Eastern Orthodox church is older, and both claim to be the successor of the original Catholic apostolic church. Another problem with the claim that the Catholic Church was the sole authority in regards to Christianity is the presence of the non-Roman churches, specifically the [Armenian Apostolic Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Apostolic_Church), the [Church of the East](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_East), and the [Coptic Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coptic_Orthodox_Church_of_Alexandria). These churches all existed in the early Middle Ages, and were not in communion with the Catholic Church (the Roman church viewed them all as heretical), when the Catholic Church had not yet split. So the claim that the Catholic Church was alone in its authority is wrong. \n\n4. Pasta (or predecessors of pasta) had existed in southern Italy for [hundreds of years before Polo's lifetime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta#History). Furthermore, tomato was completely unknown to anyone outside of Mesoamerica and South America. It was not [introduced to Europe until the Columbian Exchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato#Spanish_distribution). \n\n5. George III was not an absolute monarch. He was, however, not a (mostly) powerless figurehead like the British sovereign is today. The [king was almost a politician of his own, and had to be very careful in who he appointed if he wanted his visions to be achieved](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom#Constitutional_struggle). Parliament was the driving force behind the provocation of the American Revolution, despite the colonists' blaming of the king.",

        "text": "Hey guys. My dad and his conspiretardation grows ever worse and he has begun to talk about how the Holocaust was a \"hoax.\" His sources? Nevermind that... But he heard about [this book!](http://www.therealistreport.com/2015/01/its-finally-time-to-break-spell.html). I don't even know where to start with this. The entire book is available online as a PDF somewhere, but I can't seem to find it ATM. I'll post a link asap. I'm going to attempt to attack the insanely stupid basis of Holocaust denial as best I can. It's a big issue, full of little stupid claims down to individual testimonies of survivors and their inconsistencies, so I'll try to keep it general.\n\nSo, let's go over some brilliant bullet points that \"Doctor\" Kollerstrom brings up in his book. A cursory thumb-through of the book reveals that he establishes these points by repeatedly citing himself, other Holocaust deniers and occasionally the ever-scholarly entry like this (this is verbatim. This is real. He really cited this): in support of a contention that the allusion of shipping Jews \"to the East\" was *not* a euphemism for the gas chambers, he discusses a \"secret document\" that he found in the British Archives and cites, as his footnote citation for this document, the following: \"Search for “Public Record Office,” then go to the Discovery catalogue, and insert a file\nname, e.g. HW 16/65.\" *Ugh.* How are people reading this garbage and not being like \"hey - wtf?! that's a bold claim, sir, where's your proof?!\" Anyway...\n\n\n**Point 1: Jooze weren't killed in the gas chambers because cyanide causes people to turn pink and should have formed Prussian Blue on the walls of the gas chambers, which is water-insoluble and thus would remain.***\n\nI don't want to necessarily digress into a scientific discussion of the amounts of cyanide involved in Zyklon B and the likelihood of the buildup of Prussian Blue, but suffice it to say that there's ample evidence that the minute amount of cyanide needed to kill in gaseous form and the short amount of time (approx a half hour) that the gas would be in the room wouldn't form all that much Prussian Blue on the walls of the gas chambers. Furthermore, there's only *one* surviving gas chamber intact in Auschwitz. The rest (I'm not sure if there are any anywhere else, but Auschwitz would be the best representative anyhow) were destroyed either by the fleeing SS or someone else. These have been tested and show fairly substantial amounts of cyanide. Not enough cyanide, apparently, for the conspiratards because they fail to see that *any* amount of cyanide on the walls of a building designed to falsely resemble a large shower is pretty telling. Nevermind the fucking witnesses.\n\nDespite the Prussian Blue and that nonsense, there's the even dumber assertion that corpses should have been pink. This one has ample scientific evidence to the contrary, but that isn't even necessary: how many times have we heard of cyanide poisoning and how difficult it is to detect? I mean, that's common knowledge that screams \"YOU DON'T NECESSARILY TURN FUCKING PINK WHEN POISONED WITH CYANIDE! THERE'S NO GOOD VISIBLE INDICATOR OF CYANIDE POISONING, YOU FUCKING MORONS!\"\n\n\n**Point 2: \"Bugs were gassed at the various German-administered concentration camps during WWII, not Jews.\"**\n\nOkay, first of all this is fucking infuriating. I don't need a degree in chemistry to know that cyanide gas is a *LOT* different than cyanide in the form of delousing powder, or that the respiration rate of bugs is far less than humans and thus gassing bugs would take longer and form more prussian blue if this were true, but forget all that. How about the fucking *testimony from SS members who did it*: \n\n\"The \"disinfectors\" were at work. One of them was SS-Unterscharfuehrer\nTeuer, decorated with the Cross of War Merit. With a chisel and a\nhammer they opened a few innocuously looking tins which bore the\ninscription \"Cyclon, to be used against vermin. Attention, poison!\nto be opened by trained personnel only!\". The tins were filled to\nthe brim with blue granules the size of peas. Immediately after\nopening the tins, their contents was thrown into the holes which\nwere then quickly covered.\" - Testimony of SS-Unterscharfuehrer Pery Broad\n\n**Point 3 - \"Teh ovens wurnt gud enough to burn all those ppl.\"**\n\nYes, they were. They were specifically designed for the task, in fact. Again, here's some testimony from a guy who would know:\n\n \"I decided to design and build a crematorium with a higher capacity. I\ncompleted this project of a new crematorium in November 1942 - a\ncrematorium for mass incineration, and I submitted this project to a\nState Patent Commission in Berlin.\n\nThis \"Krema\" was to be built on the conveyor belt principle. That is\nto say, the corpses must be brought to the incineration furnaces\nwithout interruption.  When the corpses are pushed into the furnaces,\nthey fall onto a grate, and then slide into the furnace and are\nincinerated. The corpses serve at the same time as fuel for heating of\nthe furnaces. This patent could not yet be approved by the Main Patent\nOffice in Berlin, because of its classification (as a state secret).\" - Fritz Sander, engineer from Topf &amp; Sohne (I think).\n\n**Point 4: The Bletchley Park Decrypts of German communications don't talk about gassing. Ppl died from disease.\"**\n\nOh, that's convenient. Case closed, guys. I can't find these alleged decryptions from a source other than \"whatreallyhappened.info,\" so I'm inclined to not even warrant this with a response as it amounts (as far as I'm concerned) as a bunch of morons just saying something happened. Say whatever you want, but I call bullshit entirely until you produce some proof. Regardless, assuming these actually exist and show that internal German communications were showing low numbers of deaths, that's probably because they catalogued arrivals and departures and they fucking called them \"Departures by any means.\" Where were they going? 20,000 people coming and going every day in a big circle? Idiots. \n\n**Point NOT considered: THERE WERE 700,000 FUCKING LIBERATED WITNESSES. SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND. SEVEN. HUNDRED. THOUSAND. WITNESSES.**\n\nThe allies liberated a total of 700,000 people from the concentration camps at the end of the war. Not a few people saying \"hey, they were killing all of us,\" but 700 fucking thousand. What about the families of the 6 million deceased? Still around for the most part and can vouch that yup, the Germans killed our family member(s). \n\nI gotta go to class now, but [here are some sources](http://www.shamash.org/holocaust/denial/testimony.txt) showing that [this guy is a fucking idiot](http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/chemistry/blue/). If the obvious bias of those sources bugs you for some reason, [here's some objective ones](http://www.ajol.info/index.php/bcse/article/view/21297), here's [another](http://www.aacn.org/WD/CETests/Media/C111.pdf) and here's [the best comprehensive rebuttal I can find at the moment](http://www.nizkor.org/faqs/leuchter/)\n\n\n",

The rest in general is alright except for maybe the Soviet/Russian part.\n\nSo basically he said that all of the greatest empires are European. While greatness can be seen as may different qualities, when talking about empires in the world I'm sure he is talking about the power they have, qualified by territory and people controlled. In this categories, many non-Europeans have done well like the Ummayyad Caliph, Persia, Ottomans, Mali, Aztec, Inca, Qing, Mongols, and many others. \n\nIn fact, while looking at this link about the worlds biggest empires http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires#Measurement, only 6 of the top 20 are European by land area and by % of world's population it's only 3 to of the top 20. I know some of these metrics might not be the best to quantify \"greatness\", but they are probably better than most to show relative power.\n\nOverall, this bad history really pisses me off since its a failure of education systems in the West to focus on non-European history in a serious way and this ultimately leads to many assuming that places outside of Europe are uncivilized, savage etc.\n\nEdit: For rule 5, Europe cannot claim to have all the greatest empires in history because by standard of people and area there were many other empires from all over the world who were just as expansive and populated ",

        "text": "So we've heard quite a bit in this sub about the History Channel's hit series *Vikings*. The general consensus seems to be that while it's good watching, it really shouldn't be taken as a historical record. I'm not going to challenge that; in fact, as a fan of the show, I agree. With this most recent episode, however, I was somewhat taken aback by the story centered around Æthelwulf, son of Egbert, King of Mercia, and his (Æ.'s) wife Judith.\n\nFor those who don't watch or haven't watched (as mentioned above, spoilers ahead) the ongoing season, there's a subplot centered around Æthelstan's (a Christian monk captured by Ragnar Lothbrok on a raid and since naturalized as a Norseman) relationship and affair with Judith, wife of Æthelwulf. This affair produces a child, which Egbert - Æthelwulf's father - declares to be a miraculous occurrence due to the wonderful godliness of Æthelstan, whom Egbert knows well. (Kind of an instance of the 'people of the past were so stupid' badhistory, but I won't get into that, since there's simply too much of it in this show to account for.) He announces this child is to be named Alfred.\n\nNow... there are a lot of problems with that. For one, Æthelwulf's wife is not Judith at the time - she's Osburh. Alfred was born in 849, and Judith was only married to Æthelwulf in 856. Besides this discontinuity, it's obvious that the character named Judith in the series is not in fact Judith, because she and Æthelwulf are depicted at being of about the same age, whereas the historical Judith was at most in her mid-teens when she married a 50-year-old Æthelwulf. This Judith's background is apparently in the court of Northumbria, as daughter of king Ælla. Well, King Ælla died in 867, and Osburh managed to pop out five kids before she died in 856-ish, so either Ælla was hitting it pretty young (ignore the fact that he only became king in the 860s anyway, and therefore had no contact with Egbert's court as a king himself), or her background is complete fantasy (which it is: the historical Judith is from Flanders, and Osburh was daughter of someone named Oslac who had absolutely no connection with the Northumbrian throne). Believe me, if the princess of Northumbria were to be married to the prince of Wessex they probably *would have written it down* and checked for typos such as 'Flanders' instead of 'Northumbria'.\n\nThe second issue is that Alfred was in fact the last in a pretty long series of children - six, in fact. All of the others are at an unknown age, but the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* tells us that the eldest, Æthelstan (yes, 80% of them *are* named Æthel-something) was old enough to be given the position of 'king' over Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex - clearly old enough for political responsibility. So where is this grown child in the series? Well, he simply doesn't exist. But I suppose he shouldn't exist, because neither does his mother.\n\nA third problem is that Egbert is still alive and looking pretty sprightly. *How the hell is he doing that?* We've touched upon the weird progression of time in this series, but by my reckoning this is the most egregious error. Historically, King Egbert of Wessex dies in 839. Alfred is born in 849. So the producers of the show decided to shunt one of them back or forward to fit the date, fine. But how old must Egbert be, then, to see the birth of his grandson? Again, by history he's around seventy when he dies, so if that's pushed forward he has to be at least seventy-seven or so. [This look like late seventies to you?](http://image-cdn.zap2it.com/images/vikings-linus-roache-history.jpg) I don't see it.\n\nBut if they're shunting it *back*, that creates even more problems, since that's ten years of non-reign for someone to account for. Are we gonna have Egbert sit around for another ten years? What're the other characters his age gonna do, just grow old and die? Or are we gonna have Æthelwulf reign for ten years he's not meant to? Also, what about that *other* decade and a half (856-871) that Alfred's brothers had the throne? Are we just gonna throw those out too?\n\nTo sum up, the genealogy of Wessex in *Vikings* makes no sense. It starts off pretty poorly with the fact that the Judith they depict never existed in any shape or form, and doesn't fit the roles of either Osburh, Alfred's mother, or the real historical Judith, who had no children. Neither, by the way, are recorded as having been punished for adultery. Then they keep Egbert alive and not ridiculously old, I guess because he's a damn good character - but that creates the slight problem of not one but *two* missing decades along with Alfred's startling lack of siblings. \n\nWhy do the History Channel do this? Presumably because they know that when the crunch time comes and the missing time / nonsense ages might become apparent, they don't *actually* have to account for it because the vast majority of viewers won't notice that they've slipped a couple decades. Nonetheless, I'm worried that people will see this and think of it as the actual history of the West Saxons of the ninth century, which would be a shame because the truth is so much more interesting and, well, *simpler* than the fantasy they've concocted. I still love the show and its characters, but I wish they didn't go bending things around like this.\n\nSources: I'm currently preparing for an A-level in this subject (the life of king Alfred), but honestly you could get pretty much all of it [looking at this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Wessex_family_tree.jpg). But Asser's *Life of King Alfred* is where this stuff can be found.\n\nI've just seen the episode, and it's 3:00 AM, so please do tell me if I've messed anything up - there are a lot of Æthel's! - and I'll make sure to fix it.",

        "text": "Edit: I should say, my knowledge only really applies specifically to the US. From my experience, much the same goes for Britain of the period (and likely for other places), but I'm just not confident enough to apply it elsewhere specifically. However, all the photographs linked here were either produced in the US or Britain to my knowledge.\n\nPost-mortem photographs are probably the subject of more myths and unexamined beliefs than any other type of photography. Let's look at some of the more common tropes. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/9Qmy9Mt.jpg) is an image recently posted to /r/creepy, highly upvoted and claimed to be a postmortem. The reasoning given in the title was \"A picture from the Victorian era of two parents with their dead daughter in the middle. Notice how sharp the image of the daughter is compared to the parents, it was impossible for the living to hold perfectly still long enough for the shutter to cycle.\" Comments repeat many of the commoner beliefs. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/Mvfrr) is an album (containing the same image actually) posted some time ago to [/r/WTF](http://np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/17dh7w/during_the_victorian_era_it_was_not_uncommon_to/), repeating in the captions and comments many of the same beliefs as in the [/r/creepy](https://np.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/2x61sk/a_picture_from_the_victorian_era_of_two_parents/) thread. \n\nNow just on the surface this doesn't make any sense. In the caption of one photo, it claims that only those deceased were sharply focused \"because the cameras of that time had such long shutter times that you would only turn out sharp in death.\" Now...go back and look through the album at all the obviously living people (who are posed with the supposed deceased)...so wait...*everyone* here is dead?\n\n##### Exposure Times and Sharpness\nThe title itself repeats this common one, that exposure times in the 19th Century were so long that it was impossible for living subjects to hold still, therefore anyone focused sharply must be deceased. This one fortunately is pretty easy to dispel. You just have to think of the sharply focused photos of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, John Brown etc that were known to be alive at the time of numerous dated photographs. [An example of Douglass](http://i.imgur.com/5aPHd35.jpg).\n\nTo address the photograph in question, although the woman is almost certainly ill or disabled, there is nothing to suggest she is deceased. The difference in sharpness can easily be explained by either posture, lens distortion or focus. First, the man appears further from the camera and the woman closer, the young lady in the middle might be at the precise focal distance. \n\nSimilarly, she is in the middle of the image, while the others are towards the outside, and many lenses at this time exhibited strong spherical aberration from the Petval field curvature (swirl) of the most common lens design. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/EFXeg1a.jpg) is a daguerreotype example showing it. Notice how things further from the center of the photo appear more distorted. \n\nLastly she is laying down and obviously posed much more stably. When posed stably it is easy to hold still for exposures even of one minute or more. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/wcZLQSK.jpg) is a daguerreotype of myself, that had an exposure by natural windowlight of 1 minute and thirty seconds, I held still without any sort of brace or support without too much difficulty to produce a relatively sharp and focused image. And actual studios managed much shorter exposure times than that, with access to purpose-designed studios with bright natural lighting, large skylights and reflectors. [This advertisement](http://i.imgur.com/3BlAZAl.png) from 1841 shows that extremely early on, exposures under ideal conditions could be had in well under one minute. And from here on out exposure times only became shorter. A typical daguerreian studio exposure might have been between ten and thirty seconds. Once wet plate collodion processes (ambrotype, tintype, glass negatives) were introduced in the 1850s, those allowed even shorter times (neglecting improved lenses and studio lighting setups), typically about one third that of a daguerreotype, if that (source: myself and S.D. Humphrey's Practical Manual of the Collodion Process pg. 133). \n\nFrankly I don't know how this myth survives.  \n\nIronically, [here](http://i.imgur.com/yp2WlQc.jpg) is an image from my collection demonstrating the opposite! The deceased is out of focus while the living subject is sharply defined. \n\n##### Headrests\nFrequently headrests are seen in photographs from the 19th Century, such as behind the feet of the two standing children in [this image](http://i.imgur.com/YXM2Op5.jpg) (another supposed postmortem). Comments will often suggest these were used to hold up corpses to pose standing. Honestly this is not possible. The clamps were just not designed to hold up a limp body weight, they were designed to provide a discreet brace to rest your head against so it doesn't move during the exposure. [This is a period advertisement](http://i.imgur.com/5J9RF4A.jpg) for such head rests, showing their design. Even the name implies their use as a \"rest\" for a living subject. The clamps would really be ill suited to acting as a support for a dead weight (as you can see, they have rounded spoon-like ends for the comfort of sitters, which wouldn't grip very firmly). [This](http://i.imgur.com/uYxW7bL.jpg) is an 1850s ambrotype showing one in use with a clearly live subject, she is even smiling and holding her hands up, no way that one is deceased. \n\n##### Posing\nIt is a common statement that the deceased were posed upright, eyes open to appear as if alive. Now there is some truth to this, it was -occasionally- done, and there are examples where this is obvious, though exceedingly rare. The most contentious but interesting example is certainly [this](http://i.imgur.com/GdNQkkF.jpg) 1860s image from Stanley Burns' book, Sleeping Beauty. The notation suggests this photo was taken nine days after death, but there are several problems with this. First, the notation is only on the paper sleeve into which the photograph is slipped, also there is no indication the notation was written when the photograph was taken. The note could have been written by someone who was mistaken, or more likely, it could have been written about another photograph entirely, and then the original photograph and this were switched, either by mistake or by a nefarious seller. Which it is in truth, no one can say, but this image is pretty provocative anyway and worth discussion.\n\nAdditionally in photographic journals of the 19th Century, though most articles on post mortem photography suggests ways to pose the deceased peacefully as if in sleep, I did find one describing how to open the eyes and adjust them (Philadelphia Photographer 1877) \"You can effect this handily by using the handle of a teaspoon; put the upper lids down, they will stay; turn the eyeball around to its proper place, and you have the face nearly as natural as life.\" So post-mortems with eyes open posed as if in life certainly do exist. \n\nThe problem with most of these beliefs is that photograph sellers have a strong motive to perpetuate and exaggerate them. Generally, a post-mortem photograph is worth more than a similar photograph of a living person. See [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ca-1910-Real-Photo-POST-MORTEM-Creepy-Woman-in-Chair-Propped-up-RPPC-Postcard-/261665179887) photograph on ebay. This image sold for $125 probably on the claim it was a postmortem. An ordinary Real Photo Postcard of a seated old woman like this would likely be worth next to nothing, a dollar or two if that. \n\nSo when looking at a photograph like that of the old woman, what evidence do we have? She is posed in an extremely lifelike manner without any obvious signs of death or decay. Her pose appears naturalistic, her eyes lively and focused on the camera. We simply have no evidence. Similarly when looking at the image from /r/creepy, what evidence points to her being deceased and not simply ill or disabled? None. \n\n***\n\n### Costs\n\nAnd of course, nearly always costs are brought up, claiming that photographs were so expensive most people would only ever be able to afford one in their life. This is often tied into beliefs about post-mortem images as evidence. I addressed this subject in greater depth [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/Photographica/comments/2zfv91/misconception_photographs_were_expensive/), but I'll repost most of it here.\n\n##### Actual Prices\n\nActually, this one couldn't be further from the truth! Photographs were the common man's option for a portrait. Entering the era of photography, [this article](http://www.go-star.com/antiquing/miniature-portraits-19th-century.htm) does a good job outlining typical prices for portrait miniatures.\n\nTo digest it for you, entering the photographic era, even just a colored profile on paper would cost several dollars. Here is an image of an [advertisement](http://i.imgur.com/fzQqhnr.png) from 1852, where he boasts of his accessible price of ten dollars for a painted portrait miniature.\n\nAnd [here](http://i.imgur.com/NVXyqFz.jpg) is an advertisement for the significantly cheaper option of a quickly (he claims only 10 minutes sitting necessary!) sketched profile, with some colors added, offered for $2.50 in 1833 in Portland Maine.\n\nWith the announcement of the daguerreotype in 1839, it still wasn't technically perfected enough to be much of interest as a commercial portrait option until 1841 or 1842. The [highest priced earl advertisement](http://i.imgur.com/e6faOH9.png) I could find mentioning prices was this one.\n\nThis advertisement from March 1842 is -extremely- early, and rarely if ever will you run into portraits from this early period. The cheapest option offered here is six dollars. And this represents the absolute highest cost for photography. Obviously, there were always higher end photographers offering expensive services, but for a 'good deal' it doesn't get more relatively expensive than this period. For reference, [here](http://i.imgur.com/9ehUepl.jpg) (source, www.finedags.com) is an example daguerreotype from late 1841/ early 1842 (the period of this advertisement), just to get an idea what we are talking about. And even so, this high price is not -that- high, it is comparable with a quick colored profile sketch on paper, and equivalent to a couple days work for the typical wage-earner. \n\n\nJust a few years later in 1846, daguerreotype portraits [were offered](http://i.imgur.com/UpLBlUc.png) for as little as one dollar each. And as time went on, the options only got cheaper. By the 1850s, daguerreotypes were offered regularly for fifty or twenty-five cents, as brutal competition, improved business practices, and pressure from other photographic mediums drove down prices. [This advertiser card](http://i.imgur.com/vGwgxLW.png) from 1855 demonstrates how cheap things had gotten.\n\nWith the introduction of glass negatives, albumen printing, multiplying cameras etc in the 1850s it was easier than ever to produce many photos cheaply. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/BcWQMCA.png) is an advertisement from 1872 advertising 8 CDV photos for one dollar or 32 gem tintype photos for the same price.\n\nMost images you run into posted online or at a flea market or in a family album are no earlier than mid-1850s (they usually aren't daguerreotypes or early paper negative talbotype or calotype prints), and by this time photographs were definitely accessible for a dollar or usually less.\n\n##### Popularity of Photographs (Accessibility)\n\nThe popularity of early photography alone goes to show that it was not solely for the upper classes. Here are some interesting numbers. Individual daguerreotype studios in the 1850s were claiming to have produced upwards 10,000 images. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/mvgf0Zb.png) in 1852 in Boston, the Chase Brothers were claiming to have already made over 40,000 daguerreotypes. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/AeYk9V9.jpg) on an advertising card from Tyler in Boston, he claims to be making over 800 daily! [Here](http://daguerre.org/resource/texts/francis_guide.html) in an 1857 guide to New York it is stated that there were over 100 daguerreotype studios in New York City with over 3 MILLION daguerreotypes produced in the US anually. The popularity and sheer number of images produced makes it clear that this was very accessible for the average American at the time.\n\n##### What do these prices mean?\n\nTo give these prices some context, [here](http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.32106007458745;view=1up;seq=5) is a great source from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (though lengthy and chart-heavy) on average wages. Around 1850 for example when a daguerreotype might have typically cost fifty cents to a dollar, an average carpenter was earning $1.50 to $2.00 a day. You can see average wages for even unskilled laborers was generally averaging around a dollar a day at this point. Now honestly I don't know enough to really analyze this in detail, and I imagine that would require a lot more expertise about economics, cost of living, amount of money needed for life necessities etc. \n\nHowever, just these values should give the impression that photographs were not enormously expensive. In fact, they were well within reach of the average person. Although this is perilous and fraught with error to attempt, if a daguerreotype cost about one days wages for a relatively unskilled laborer, then we could say today it might cost 8 hours of work for someone earning something like $10 an hour or so. So today a cost of around $100 seems about accurate. And though that certainly seems expensive for a photograph in an age of essentially free photography, it is certainly within reach of just about anybody (especially when it is the most affordable means of accurate portraiture available).\n\nIt is actually exceedingly rare that we can use the photograph's existence (and not the subjects depicted) to say anything about the wealth of the sitters. Only in really rare cases of a particularly costly (at the time) photograph, either by an identified expensive photographer or the case of something like an unusually massive or ornately presented image. And these kinds of cases are definitely the exception rather than the rule, and when this misconception is spouted off, this is not usually what the speaker is thinking.\n\nSo hopefully this does a little to dispel the myth that photographs were so expensive in the 19th Century that anyone in one must be wealthy. They were rather the affordable portrait of choice for the common man! People got them frequently for all kinds of reasons (including frivolous silly ones!)  and not just blowing their life-savings on photos of propped up dead bodies.",

With 112 points at the time of posting, /u/poles_apart claims that:\n\n&gt;I guess if you get into medieval period instances of friendly fire in mass brawls would be higher. I don't really have many sources (although theres tons of videos on youtube that go over this stuff) but a lot of combat was 1v1 or 2v1, the battlefield would break down into individual skirmishes. If you killed your opponent you would either help someone on your faction kill his opponent or go off and fight someone who just killed someone on your faction around the same time.\n\nAs most people here probably already know, this could not *be* more wrong. Unlike the hollywood presentation of battles, where the hero is perfectly free to wander about the battlefield spinning around like a gymnast while the enemy politly lines up one by one to be knocked over dead as soon as he waves his sword in their general direction, real battles were not fought like this. Units of hundreds faced each other in great massed groups five or more ranks deep, and attempted to make the other side break and run away by charging them with their lances or spears. Anyone who tried to fight on their own in the middle of this got killed pretty quickly since the enemy wasn't polite and saw no reason to come at the independent fighter one at a time, or take the time to pair themselves up with the enemy fighters for a series of duels. They much preferred to charge unsupported individuals down with a thundering mass of hundreds of armoured knights instead. \n\nHalberdiers and zwiehander wielders had the perhaps greatest independence within their unit as they fought semi-independently to disrupt and break the enemy's pikes. But they didn't fight duels independently of their unit, they stayed close to their own pikes for mutual defence. \n\nOnce an army had broken down into individuals, it was already defeated, and the individuals were in the midst of fleeing for their lives/getting brutally massacred, and had no time or inclination to be fighting anyone, even if the enemy had been polite enough to only come at them one at a time.\n",

Belarus was later an integral part of what was called Litva, which included today's Belarus as well as today's Lithuania. Belarus was the birthplace of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Belarusian was the state language of the Grand Duchy until 1697, in part owing to the strong flowering of Belarusian culture during the Renaissance through the works of leading Belarusian humanists such as Frantzisk Skaryna.\n\nThe facts are all sort of right. Belarusian territories were absorbed into Kievan Rus'. And later into Litva/Duchy of Lithuania. And Frantzisk Skaryna was born and Belarus and was humanist (though most of his life he spent in Western Europe).\n\nWhat's interesting is a spin put on all those things.\n\n&gt;the emerging Belarusian state\n\nAs most sharp-sighted of you can notice, the word \"Belarus\" contains the word \"Rus\". As you may guess, those two words are connected. There were various Slavic principalities on territory of Belarus (Polotsk, Orsha, Turov) and they were incorporated into Kievan Rus just as many other principalities around. There was no specific difference between principalities on territory of modern Belarus and, say, Ukraine or Russia. The whole idea of Belarus (literally \"White Rus\". There are many versions to what exactly \"White\" means - Christian, No-Mongols, Beautiful, Using white stone in architecture) is connected to Rus and emerged gradually. Conservapedia paints a picture of an already existing nation subjugated by another nation which is not really how it worked in early Feudal society. I'm sure people in comments can clarify it.\n\n&gt;Belarusian was the state language of the Grand Duchy\n\nHere we come to the big thing. This and similar arguments are used by various East Slavic nationalists. [The thing is they call the same Old East Slavic language Old Belarusian, Old Russian and Old Ukrainian language](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Old_East_Slavic). This, I think, is an interesting way of badHistory: the terminology itself politicizes history. In reality Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian languages gradually branched out of Old East Slavic language. Descriptions like the one Conservapedia makes only serve to paint are picture of thousand years all separation and struggle of national identities. And this is huge case of presentism.\n\nTLDR: Conservapedia says nations exist in the same state since the dawn of time.",

But the claim here is so *stupid* that I just can't do a high quality R5 on this. I'm sorry.\n\nI was on *Conservapedia* the other day, don't ask me why, where I found a list of [\"Greatest Mysteries of World History.\"](http://www.conservapedia.com/Essay:Greatest_Mysteries_of_World_History) Many of the so-called great historical mysteries seem to not be historical ones (for example, \"Is democracy compatible with Islam?\"), or ones that probably shouldn't be \"great mysteries\" (such as \"Who was the first ruler of China,\" which depends on your definition of 'first ruler,' but the [first figure to hold the title of *Huangdi*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang) is well-known enough).\n\nOne of these supposed mysteries of history is \n\n&gt; #2. Did genuine humor exist prior to Christianity?\n\nWhat?\n\nFirst, the definition of \"genuine humor\" is completely unexplained. [Merriam-Webster defines humor](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humor) as \n\n&gt; a :  that quality which appeals to a sense of the ludicrous or absurdly incongruous\n\n&gt; b :  the mental faculty of discovering, expressing, or appreciating the ludicrous or absurdly incongruous\n\n&gt; c :  something that is or is designed to be comical or amusing\n\nSo, is Conservapedia right that there was nothing designed to be \"genuinely\" comical or amusing prior to the introduction of Christianity?\n\nFor one, how exactly could Ancient Greek people enjoy the works of [Aristophanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristophanes) and other comedians if they had no sense of humor? Actually, given that Aristophanes himself would also have been humorless, how exactly did he write his *comedies* in the first place? \n\nAnd other than the Greek comedians, [Ancient Egyptians had a sense of humor](http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/people/humor.htm) in a very diverse array of forms. [Political humor](http://www.livescience.com/18147-ancient-riddles-decoded-mesopotamia.html) expressed through riddles have been uncovered in Mesopotamian sites. [Early Chinese philosophy](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1399450?sid=21106253933213&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3738016&amp;uid=4) contains many humorous elements. EDIT: [Also a Sumerian fart joke](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/01/oldest_joke/)\n\nAnd in the Bible itself, [many find humor in the Old Testament](http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-interpretation/laughter-in-the-bible-absolutely/). Furthermore, mockery would be (IMO) considered a form of humor, and from [2 Kings 2:23](http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-23.htm) (KJB):\n\n&gt; And he [Elisha] went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.\n\nWhy would these children mock Elisha in the first place, given that they don't have \"the mental faculty of discovering, expressing, or appreciating the ludicrous or absurdly incongruous?\"\n\nThere is additionally no evidence (AFAIK) whatsoever that Romans or Chinese or Indians suddenly developed a completely novel mental faculty in the first century AD, which is something you would expect people to note. If Conservapedia meant to say that *only* Christians can appreciate humor, well, again there is no evidence I know of, historical, archaeological, or scientific, that conversion to Christianity spontaneously enables the convert to find things funny.\n\nAnd finally, most non-Christian people actually do seem to have a sense of humor.",

        "text": "Now, while there has already been a rather [excellent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2yn2z3/16th_century_helmets_in_the_viking_age/) about some of the poor armor in *Vikings*, I thought I'd take a moment to touch on some of the other badhistory that I noticed, as well as dipping into some bad geography and what happens when showrunners pick out names without context:\n\nFirstly, there's the name of Ragnar Lothbrok himself. Lothbrok is actually a nickname roughly translating to \"Shaggy Breeches.\" In the original *saga of Ragnar Lothbrok* from which the name comes, Ragnar kills a linnorm (a kind of wingless, bipedal, poison-spewing dragon) by donning shaggy clothes treated with tar and sand to shrug off the poison, thus earning the nickname \"Lothbrok.\" In reality, he would probably have been named after his father, who goes unnamed in the original sagas.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of silly names, Rollo, Ragnar's brother, would in fact have been named *Hrolfr*. Rollo is the Latinized name given to the first [leader of the Viking principality that became Normandy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollo), whom Rollo is supposedly based on. And the fact that he apparently lived several decades before the foundation of the Norman principality is part of the silliness of Vikings as a show. Apparently every important social change in Viking Age history happened because of one dysfunctional family and one disproportionately charismatic farmer/Jarl/King.\n\nNow, getting names wrong is all well and good. All in all, it's a very mild case of bad history. What *is* genuine bad history, however, is getting all your dates and people wrong. Pretty much every significant Anglo-Norse interaction happens entirely because of Ragnar's family, and within the span of a single lifetime. Ragnar is the first man to raid Lindisfarne monastery in 793, and by then he already has a twelve-year old (meaning he's at least somewhere in his late twenties). Now, while Ragnar himself is a mythical character, and his sons are equally dubious, if we assume that, for the purposes of this critique, the saga's dates hold, that would mean that his sons invade England as punishment for his death somewhere around 865 AD (at the head of the Great Heathen Army), almost 72 years later. In an age where life expectancy was barely thirty years, that's an *impressively* long life.\n\nAnd on that note, the idea that the Vikings didn't know England existed before 793 is absurd. The Jutes (from whom the Jutland peninsula is named) invaded England alongside the Angles and the Saxons. The idea that in they would have mysteriously forgotten about a landmass like that is patently absurd. As is Jarl Haraldson (why does he go by his last name?) calling the landmass to the east Russia before Russia ever existed as a kingdom.\n\nFinally, some bad geography: The city in which most of the series takes place is called Kattegat. Now, Kattegat is actually just the name for the strait between the northern parts of the Jutland Peninsula and the Swedish provinces of Västergotland, Scania and Halland. There's no real record of a settlement with that name in Viking Age history. However, since there are *clearly* mountains in the background of a great many scenes in the first season, clearly Kattegat must lie somewhere in Sweden, since Denmark is far too flat to have any mountains. In fact, the highest point above sea level is a little over 200 metres.\n\n Meanwhile, the city that Lagertha, Ragnar's first wife, takes over as Jarl in season 2, Hedeby, *did* actually exist. It was a trading outpost in the southern part of the Jutland peninsula, in what is now the province of Schleswig. But apparently, Lagertha is perfectly capable of riding from [Western Sweden to southern Jutland](http://www.scandinaviantravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SCANDINAVIA-MAP-4.jpg) before the Øresund Bridge ever existed to connect the two landmasses. This also calls into question why a population of what is presumably Jutes would suddenly accept the leadership of a woman from a different tribe of Norsemen (for all intents and purposes a foreigner) just because she happened to kill the last guy who ran the place.\n\nNotes: \n\nFor most of the Viking Age history in this, I just used my old high school history textbook which sadly isn't available in English. The time of the Great Heathen Army's invasion is given after the translated *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*, which is kind of infamous for its artistic license, so take the exact dates with a grain of salt.\n\nFor the Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok, I used a translated copy of the original saga. For the interested, there's a free English translation [here,](http://www.northvegr.org/sagas%20annd%20epics/legendary%20heroic%20and%20imaginative%20sagas/old%20heithinn%20tales%20from%20the%20north/055.html) but I won't vouch for its accuracy.",

Ambitious but Rubbish](http://i.imgur.com/5gmOSah.jpg)\n\nWhile I believe it is meant to be hyperbole the fact is it's mostly just wrong. All of them where highly successful, not rubbish. I'm not going to even touch on \"The Crazy One's\" part of the title. Below are just some of the inaccuracies. But I'm sure there are others. \n\n*Alexander the Great - He was not on the verge of conquering the known world. After extending his reach to India his men were sick of campaigning and their discontent forced him to halt (or likely lose his army). He didn't expand any further (at least no major expansion that I can think of) and died a few years later in 323. At the time of his death there were a number of Empires/Kingdoms and so forth that where know to the Macedonians and Greeks which were not under their control (Carthage, the Nanda Empire in India, Meroe in Africa to name but a few).\n\n*Julius Caesar - A user in the thread pointed out that the statue in the picture isn't a statue of Julius Caesar but rather Augustus. On top of that Julius was stabbed by a several senators and I'm not sure Brutus could really be considered his \"best mate\". He wasn't starting an empire he proclaimed himself dictator for life (other's had done this before, perhaps most notably Sulla), this does not mean that he was proclaiming an empire or that empire was inevitable.\n\n*Genghis Khan - The guy died in his sixties as head of the largest land empire yet seen and this is after he had been captured by his dead fathers enemies and enslaved for a short time, in what way is that \"rubbish\". And once again \"on the verge of conquering the known world\". There was still a bit of a way to go for the Mongols. Upon Ghenghis Khans death most of the middle east was still outside of their control as was pretty much all of Europe and even much of most of the area that makes up modern day China. It was under Ogedai his successor that the Jin dynasty in China was finally defeated (and the Song in the south was still around). It was also under Ogedei that the Mongols pushed deep into Europe. The Mongol empire didn't fully fragment until the death of the fourth Great Khan, Möngke in 1259 (over 30 years and 2 other Great Khans after the death of Genghis). Even then the fragments were large and powerful hoards and dynasties themselves which in some cases continued to expand.\n\n*Napoleon - I'm not knowledgeable enough about Napoleon to be able to point out the exact flaws of this (but I'm sure somebody else can) suffice it to say that this is at best a simplification of events. What I do know is that even with the loss of most of his Army in Russia, Napoleon wasn't finished yet, It was nearly a year from leaving Russia before the defeat at Leipzig. And after his exile to Elba, Napoleon pretty quickly regained control of France (if only for a short time) until being defeated again and being exiled to Saint Helena. It should be noted that Napoleon is the only historical figure in the image that didn't die at was arguably the height of his power. Also, I can't help but wonder if they're going with the \"invading Russia is always stupid\" fallacy which pops up so often on the internet but it's not explicit so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n*Clarkson - I won't expand on this since it is current events, besides users in the linked thread already pointed out one of the glaring inaccuracies.\n\nedit-corrected reddit link to an np",

        "text": "There's a show on UK Channel 4 called Indian Summers, and it takes place in 1932 India.\n\nI've been noticing over the course of the series that they use Parker 51 pens, which weren't introduced until the 1940s, and I see this trope in other films, movies, and TV shows.\n\n[This is what a Parker 51 looks like.](https://munchkinwrangler.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/pens-0071.jpg)\n\nHere it is in two shots of the show.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/KJ4TRNt\n\nhttp://imgur.com/AfyIsrG\n\nThis pen is used over and over in shows set before the 40s, when more accurate pens would be the [Parker Vacumatic](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/1945_Parker_Vacumatic_open.jpg/800px-1945_Parker_Vacumatic_open.jpg) from 1932 through 41, or the [Parker Duofold](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/ParkerPens.jpg) from 1921 on, if we're just keeping it in the Parker family. But, these pens have unquestionably 30s and 20s designs. You can easily tell if those pens are time frame accurate.\n\n\n\nSomething else wrong is the writing. Not the words themselves, those are fine, but the actual act of writing. There are moments in many shows where there is a wide shot of a character writing, then a cut to the writing, and it looks very fancy, like in the above screenshot of a letter. Now, this is fine, obviously a professional was brought in to do that part, and it looks it. The slant is the consistent one of a trained writer, almost without variation, as it is in the screenshot. Many schoolchildren were trained at writing around the turn of the 20th century, which is why old notes in old books from the 1900s-1950s look so wonderfully written, so the quality of the writing of the educated people here is sensible.\n\nBut, their form is not.\n\nMost wide shots show someone with a pose like [this](http://www.nicabm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Person-writing-in-notebook1.jpg) which is a common one today, and one that makes intuitive sense to people. You use your wrist and fingers to shape the letters, but this always causes problems in speed and variation, as your hand is left to rest on the page, forcing many small movements of your hand over the page from left to right.\n\nNot only does the fancy writing in these shows not support the idea it were written this way, but, as far as I know, so does history.\n\n[This photo](http://www.cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/images/1/15/Arm_positions.png) is a scan from an instruction manual for Palmer business script, showing how to hold your hand. While Palmer script was a chiefly American script (popular from the late 1800s until the 1950s), this model for arm and hand placement was not. It was common for most, if not all, major cursive scripts taught in the 19th and early 20th centuries. \n\nThe difference between this and the common modern form is that the ring and small finger are used to drag along the paper and gently support your hand and give it an even distance to the page, while your *arm* does the fine motion. It took much work and training to get students to write this way, and they used exercises such as [this](http://www.cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/images/7/7e/Palmer_drill_1.png) so students would be used to the loops and lines. Once these were done correctly, the writing could commence using reflexes created during these drills, teaching letter forms as simply parts of these basic motions. This is a common practice in many scripts, with only the details differing.\n\n**Therefore, we have two spots of bad history** I'm well versed enough in to talk about in Indian Summers, though they are common among period films and TV shows:\n\n1. Both education in the period plus the consistency in lettering of most writing like this is indicative of the arm being the primary motivator, but wide shots show modern actors using their wrists and fingers to write.\n2. While iconic, Parker 51 pens were not available before World War II.\n\nFeel free to correct me anywhere I got something wrong.",

As already discussed, it wasn't as early as this person suggests, but in reality probably begun in the 6th C BC. By this time there certainly were monotheistic, monolatric, or henotheistic religious traditions (e.g. Zoroastrianism)\n\n2. For that matter, some monolatric and henotheistic traditions, e.g. Akhenaten's Aten cult were around in the 14th century BC -- that is, during the Levant's Bronze Age.

Even 3.8 billion people. Probably the vast majority of the world's population \"believe\" in classical mechanics -- to at least a great a degree as these people believe in Exilic composition of the Pentateuch -- that doesn't mean that physicists consider that quantum might not be correct.

        "author": "whatismoo",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3034tx/the_historiography_of_air_control_or_how_to_do/",
        "text": "The following is modified from a paper I wrote entitled \"This is Air Control to Lloyd George: Air Control and the Disposition of the British Empire in the immediate post-WWI era, 1919-29\" which I've made an attempt to modify to suit the subreddit's purpose better.\n\nIn the immediate post WWI era the British devised a genius plan to police the Empire, which they dubbed \"Air Control.\" Under this doctrine planes would enforce imperial will from the air by punitively bombing, rather than marching troops out and shelling them.\n\nSince then Air Control operations have been characterized in two separate ways. These can be broadly categorized as from either a pro- or anti- Air Control point of view. The arguments of the pro-Air Control camp, in this case David Niven, and the RAF’s official history, stem from the RAF’s contemporary defenses of Air Control in the face of parliamentary and journalistic complaints, and paint a very rosy picture of the doctrine. The claim was that it killed hardly anyone, was cheap, and effective.^1 On the other hand, the anti-Air Control camp, here specifically Dr. James Corum, point out that Air Control operations often resulted in the bombardment of the incorrect villages, killed civilians, and alienated the general populace, while being no more cost effective than previous methods of imperial policing.^2  \n\nTwo sources, both of whom should know better, that wholeheartedly promote Air Control are David Niven’s Architects of Air Power, and the RAF’s official history. They make audacious claims of the doctrine. Niven describes the air operations in Iraq as inflicting light casualties, using few troops, cheap, and successful.\n\n&gt; “On report of disturbances, RAF planes first dropped summonses calling the offending tribesmen to a court of law. If a summons went unheeded, the RAF returned, warning locals with leaflets or loudspeakers that their village would be bombed on a given day and recommending evacuation. The bombing attacks were usually light but they continued day after day until displaced villagers grew weary and complied with british demands…. Cheap effective, and relatively bloodless aerial policing was soon extended throughout the Empire, and gave the RAF a new lease on life.”^3\n\nThe RAF history says much the same thing, although it does mention that the airlifting of troops was a “... hallmark of successful Air Control operations.”^4\n\nThese sources are not stellar. Neither cite sources, nor do they provide any counter argument, or any hint that Air Control may not have been a sound doctrine. In short, they lack any type of nuance whatsoever. The RAF history comes close, explaining that, while Air Control did kill civilians, they were not specifically targeted, and fewer were killed than if a punitive column had been used.^5 In Architects of Air Power, much emphasis is put on Air Control being a cost effective way to police the Empire, and of how 8 RAF squadrons controlled Iraq better than the 39 battalions stationed previously. However these claims are fundamentally flawed. They originate with several RAF officers and military journalists during the 1920s and 1930s, notably Sir Basil Liddell Hart, proponent of Air Control Military Correspondent for the Telegraph, and unofficial spokesperson for the British military, a position from which he extolled the virtues of Air Control almost as fast as they could be imagined.\n\nThe opponents of Air Control are just as vehement in their arguments as its supporters. Dr. James S. Corum, in his article “The Myth of Air Control: Reassessing the History,” published in Air and Space Power Journal, the official peer-reviewed academic journal of the U.S. Air Force, addresses all of the supposed positives brought up by proponents of Air Control, and summarily debunks them. The supposed cheap operations in Iraq were only so because British Indian troops were not paid for in the same budget as the British Army. The drawdown of British forces, likewise, was actually a replacement of British forces with British Indian troops and local levies. The supposed light civilian casualties are directly refuted by James Thomas, Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs, when he complained that the high casualties resulting from Air Control could not be readily defended in the face of parliamentary inquiry.^6 Niven’s Architects of Air Power, for all it makes of the supposed cost effectiveness of policing from the air, failed to mention that to crush the Iraqi Rebellion of 1920 took £40,000,000/-/-, more double the Royal Air Force’s entire budget for 1919.^7 The most damaging retort, though, is that Air Control fails to solve, or even acknowledge the underlying causes of insurgency among the colonials, that being their own ethno-cultural conflicts, political aspirations, and resent of imperial domination.^8\n\nFrom these two very diametrically opposed viewpoints the conclusion can be drawn that through air power seemed the perfect solution to the problems of a cash-strapped British Empire, and was successful in some cases, air power alone proved unable to hold territory and enforce Imperial will in the face of determined resistance, most notably in Iraq during the many conflicts which arose there in the 1920s. Furthermore the narrative of success which many presented on the subject of Air Control Operations in the Empire is a flawed one stemming from an instinctive institutional sense of self preservation in the face of constrained budgets and increasing outrage at the force used against colonial subjects.^9\n\nBetween the wars the United Kingdom faced a myriad of problems, from a failing economy at home, to dissent abroad. The fate of the Empire rested on whether or not the British could find a way to inexpensively and efficiently maintain order in their overseas territories. Simultaneously the Royal Air Force, seeking a permanent place in Imperial policy, offered the concept of Air Control. This seemed to be the perfect solution. Small numbers of British pilots would maintain order over large swathes of territory at a modest cost.\n\n Unfortunately for the British the theory of Air Control did not translate into reality. Despite initial successes in Aden, Somaliland, and the NWTP Air Control failed its first major test, Iraq. The policy failed to address any of the root problems of Iraqi dissent, instead entrenching the populace against the British. Word soon came back to the politicians and journalists in the UK of villages destroyed, houses bombed, women and children killed. In order to save the Royal Air Force a mythology was created, of gallant pilots defending the empire. The official line was that Air Control was a humane and cost effective policy, which hardly killed anyone. The reality was that Air Control consistently targeted civilians, bombed indiscriminately, and failed to solve the underlying causes of the conflicts, while costing a cash strapped Empire an inordinate amount of money.  Though the success or failure of British Air Control operations during the decade immediately following the end of the First World War can be debated, Trenchard and Churchill’s promise to Lloyd George of a cheap, efficient, and humane method of policing the Empire ensured for the RAF a permanent role in Imperial policy during the socio-economic unrest which prevailed during the period.\n\nWhat does this mean historiographically? It means that though it is readily apparent that air control was about as useful as a screen door on a submarine there is still some controversy about the subject. I will admit that there has been a significant reexamining of air control in recent years, however barely 20 years separate Niven and Corum, and even more glaringly the RAF history that I used was from 2014. That means that even now, nearly 100 years after the whole mess was invented, people are still purporting that it was at all useful. The issue here is not our usual crazy nutjobs spouting bullshit about slaves having it nice, or nazis being nazis, or even plain old misinformed people. What we have here is an institution bullshitting the politicians to keep in existence, then upholding this lie as the gospel truth for almost 95 years now, in spite of decades of clear evidence refuting it. \n\nWhat's the moral of the story here, fellow badhistorians? Always be wary of biases present in institutional histories and those which don't cite sources. Be aware that when all your sources are agreeing you might not be getting the while picture. And that generally when two diametrically opposed authors agree that something happened there is a good chance it did. Also put on a coat before you go out, you'll catch cold. And take this umbrella too, it looks like it could rain soon. And make sure you have a hat. And what about those grandchildren?\n\nBut really, jokes aside, this is pretty basic shit, and the fact that the RAF is trying to continue saying that Air Control worked is crazy.\n\n***\n\n1.

        "text": "I saw this \"[1200 year old viking home](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2zwdpg/remains_of_a_1200_year_old_viking_home/)\" thread on /r/pics and, while I'm no expert and may be wrong on some specifics, I'm pretty sure there's some badhistory in here.  For starters, that doesn't look very much like other viking houses I've [seen pictures of](https://www.google.com/search?q=viking+houses&amp;rlz=1C1LENN_enUS464US464&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1262&amp;bih=655&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kRQQVZyZCpL-gwTaxYPIBg&amp;ved=0CB0QsAQ), and does look very like some neolithic sites like [Skara Brae](https://www.google.com/search?q=skara+brae&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1262&amp;bih=655&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FBUQVZOQM8iXNqaNgqAB&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ).  I know \"looks like some google searches\" is hardly a basis of rigorous  scholarship though, so if anyone knows what this place actually is I'd love to hear them chime in.  I tried to tin eye the picture to find a copy with more context, but no luck...this pic might actually be original content.\n\nThen you get down into the comments and you have a subthread of  [comments](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2zwdpg/remains_of_a_1200_year_old_viking_home/cpmxpfm) by /u/estlande.  Most noteable to me:\n\n&gt;Raiding, which is obviously an incredible exception to the people of 10th century. Truth is, they were not worse than any other people of that time, but history books are written by victors.\n\nAs the next people in the thread point out, it's not Victor Victorsson who is writing history here, but the very people who were getting their monasteries and villages sacked.  It's about as clear-cut a case of history being written by the loser as you can find.  \n\nNext up we have estalante's response to people pointing out that it was the monks writing history here:\n\n&gt;It would be like people 200 years from now taking the word of tumblrinas for how terrible men were.\n\nI think there's a bit of a difference between discussions of how bad men are and discussions of how a local center of population was attacked and people were killed.  Maybe it's just me, though.  \n\n&gt;History is a game of telephone, it starts as manspreading and ends up as manslaughter.\n\nThis is a reply from somebody else in the comment thread, but I think it kind of misses the point.  When you have records from the time an event occurred, there _isn't_ really a game of telephone.  Instead there's a more direct transmission of information.  It's not like we have only oral histories of the viking attacks, there are written records from the time that mention them.\n\nThere's also some \"raiding olympics\" further down in the thread, discussing who was worse, Vikings, Franks, Crusades, or Arabs.  I feel this somewhat misses the point.  \"Everyone is doing it\" doesn't make enslaving and pillaging any more fun for the people on the receiving end.  I won't go into it, because it might be edging into genocide olympics.\n\nBut that does bring us to Irish slaves, specifically in the context of [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2zwdpg/remains_of_a_1200_year_old_viking_home/cpmzgs8)\n\n&gt;How is raiding worse than invading? The vikings wanted riches, they had nothing else on their mind. (up until the invasion of England, which was about vengeance)\nInvaders on the other hand actually forced people away from their homes permanently, if not killing them. They forced their culture and religion on others, completely changing their lives. How is this more lenient than the vikings simply taking your money and causing some distress?\n\"The Franks didn't raid and enslave quiet coastal monestaries.\"\nEnslaved? Can I have a source for the vikings enslaving monasteries? All they did was raid then because they were a source of great riches.\n\nFirst off, the Vikings _certainly_ did enslave people (who were themselves a source of riches as slaves).  /u/depanneur provides some sources to this effect from Ireland, including\nthe following from [Fragmentary Annals of Ireland](http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100017/text020.html)\n&gt; In this year the Norwegian kings besieged Srath Cluada in Britain, camping against them for four months; finally, having subdued the people inside by hunger and thirst—the well that they had inside having dried up in a remarkable way—they attacked them. First they took all the goods that were inside. A great host was taken out into captivity.\n\nThe same text also makes mention of an _Irish_ raid on Scotland and England that took away captives, though, which just goes to show that the Vikings weren't the only ones in the game.\n\n&gt;Invaders on the other hand actually forced people away from their homes permanently, if not killing them. They forced their culture and religion on others, completely changing their lives.\n\nJust to touch on this: invaders _don't_ always do this.  For example, modern thought is that the Anglo-saxon invaders didn't force out the native British from England, but rather intermixed with them.  And the tug of culture and religion was also hardly one-way...while there was certainly a cultural shift, the Anglo-saxons eventually adopted the religion of those they invaded.\n",

        "text": "I'm not an historian, just a moderately well-read person who loves history. I am not going to spend the time refuting this bit of bad history, just because it's pretty evident and somewhat besides the point.\n\nI haven't quite finished Jules Witcover's [*The American Vice Presidency From Irrelevance to Power*](http://www.amazon.com/The-American-Vice-Presidency-Irrelevance/dp/1588344711) simply because I'm not sure my blood pressure can take it. There is no poor analysis or outlandish theories to be found; it presents itself as a list of American Vice Presidents, giving each a short biography and some background as to why they were chosen for the office. The commercial reviews on Amazon laud the \"impressive research,\" never writing about its drawbacks.\n\nNo, my temples were throbbing by the shear number of factual errors and sloppy editing in the work. It started quietly enough with the death of Elbridge Gerry on November 23, 1814, \"four months before the end of his term,\" continued with Winfield Scott rising from his grave to run as a Democrat in 1880 (not Winfield Scott Hancock), turned Thomas Marshall into a Republican for a brief time, and lo and behold, by the time of the Harding Assassination I was just skimming. Now I know that Nelson Rockefeller did not donate his residence to be the Vice Presidential residence and that actually five Vice Presidents went on to be elected President without first gaining the office through vacancy (so easy to forget Richard Nixon), but really, why hadn't a person with a reasonable interest in the topic read over the book?\n\nTrust me, these are only a few of the howlers found in the book. Garfield was not nominated because \"some New York delegates, in defiance of Conkling, switched to him on the thirty-fifth ballot.\" When Witcover promises that \"...we shall see in a succeeding chapter\" that Charles Fairbanks made a return to national politics, I was figuring that we would get a more than a mere *mention* that the Republican candidates in 1916 were Charles Evans Hughes and Charles Fairbanks.\n\nSo, why is all this badhistory and not just badediting? First of all, large numbers of silly, large errors start to call into question all the purported facts in the work. When I catch an error in a work, my heart sinks a bit, but if the error is minor and not related to the main subject, I can forgive it as a moment of human weakness. But it seems to me that in this case, Witcover's publisher just didn't care. Witcover is a journalist, not an historian, but Smithsonian Books should know better.\n\nArrgh!",

I have many qualms with his politics, but I'm going to make this strictly about the historical errors he makes in order to avoid sparking any political debate.\n\n\nA few points:\n\n1. Thomas Jefferson was a \"classical liberal,\" and that just means he was pro-free market. Jefferson in a certain sense was conservative for his time. While he was populist, he also was a huge believer in the power of agriculture over industrialization. Jefferson was also a slaveholder. I'm not going to even get into Franklin.\n\n2. How the hell did Jefferson and Franklin \"transcend\" the politics of their time? They were products of their time like anyone else. Both were party to voting restrictions based on land that were reactionary by the time 1900 rolled around. Both also held views on race that are deeply disturbing to almost everyone in 21st century America. The idea that they somehow transcended their time is ridiculous and an implicit endorsement of great man history.\n\n3. Applying the idea of left vs right wing politics in American history starts to get anachronistic once you talk about things that happened before FDR. \n\n3. An exceedingly large amount of prohibitionists [maybe even most] were left wingers. Prohibition was taken up by the left wing Progressive Movement of the early 1900s. Alcoholism was rampant at that time, and many left wingers believed that prohibition would lead to lower rates of alcoholism, less domestic abuse, an improved family life, and a more efficient society. By the time prohibition was repealed, basically all conservatives and liberals were on board with the repeal besides the Southern Democrats. \n\n4. He neglected to mention the great right wing movements of history such as the the rebels against the Communists in Europe.\n\n5. I may be playing with semantics, but many unions [especially the early ones] were and have been socialist rather than liberal.",

But our writer doubled down:\n\n&gt; And you have to be delusional to not notice the church was an arm of the state. As a matter a fact under Stalin (a trained though never ordained orthodox priest)...\n\nLet's pause here. The obvious implication is that while Stalin may have never *technically* entered the Georgian Orthodox priesthood, he remained a man of faith. In fact, Stalin himself stated that he became an atheist in his first year at the seminary. (Simon Sebag Montefiore, [*Young Stalin*](http://smile.amazon.com/Young-Stalin-Simon-Sebag-Montefiore/dp/1400096138/), p. 64) Incidentally, that seminary was closed in 1919.\n\nLet's pick up the badhistory:\n\n&gt; ...under Stalin...the official organization of the church was greatly expanded, the number of open churches reached 25,000. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active.\n\nYou know how many churches there were in 1917? 54,000. In the subsequent persecution, all were expropriated, most were closed, and many were physically demolished, notably including Moscow's [Cathedral of Christ the Saviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Christ_the_Saviour) in 1931. By 1939, that number was in the low hundreds. Over 100,000 members of the clergy were killed in the Great Purge, with 85,000 shot in 1937 alone. (Alexander N. Yakovlev, [*A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia*](http://smile.amazon.com/Century-Violence-Soviet-Russia/dp/0300103220/), p. 165) So, yes, the Russian Orthodox Church \"grew\" under Soviet rule, if you ignore the fact that it was the Soviets who had brutally suppressed it to the size that it was.\n\nSo, in 1957, the number of churches was 22,000. And Kruschev reversed the reversal of the state's policy towards the Russian Orthodox Church. By 1975, only 7,000 churches remained.\n\nOur author also [tells us](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2z22hu/no_idea_how_to_respond_to_this_im_not_a_history/cpf5ui0):\n\n&gt; Stalin...is being considered for canonization by the Orthodox church\n\nThis bizarre claim appears to derive from an [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2445683/Could-Josef-Stalin-be-made-a-saint.html) in *The Telegraph*, which reports that the canonisation was being petitioned for by the Communist Party. The source dryly notes:\n\n&gt;  Yet the idea of tuning Uncle Joe into Saint Joe has so far won little official backing from the Orthodox Church, which was one of Stalin's chief victims.\n\n&gt; Seeking to establish atheism as the Soviet Union's official creed, Stalin destroyed thousands of churches and sent tens of thousands of priests to the gulags and their deaths.\n\nYeah, I'm sure the Russian Orthodox Church is \"considering\" that canonisation really hard.",

        "text": "I am not a historian (IANAH), but I've done my share of reading r/badhistory to identify some popular misconceptions in the wild. The current goldmine is the second coming of the thread \"Historians of Reddit, What are some of the freakiest coincidences of history?\". Some answers are fishy (I didn't know there were so many historians on reddit! /s), but [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2zqt7t/historians_of_reddit_what_are_some_of_the/cplk8qb) called my attention:\n\n&gt; thatguywithapencil170 points15 hours ago\n\n&gt; Jesus wasn't actually born on Christmas.25th of December was only chosen because it was the day of saturnalia and many pagans would celebrate on that day so they just changed his birthday to 25th of December. Many people actually think he was born in the spring because the shepherds would watch over the field and if this was winter it wouldn't be done.\n\nIt reminded me of [a recent submission](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2y5a3y/summary_of_religions/) by u/Jooseman on r/badhistory, concerning \"Summary of Religions\" (lol):\n\n&gt;&gt;Most of the Catholic holidays are celebrated on dates which were originally designated to holidays of those indigenous religions\n\n&gt;While they did take traditions from these other holidays, there are reasons for the dates that many of the Christian holidays are on, not necessarily because of the holidays of other religions\n\n&gt;Example\n\n&gt;&gt;It is known for celebrating Jesus’ birthday in December, a consequence of merging Christianity with non-Christian events, in this case the Winter Solstice\n\n&gt; Wrong, the date for Christmas came about because in the second and third centuries Christians were trying to add up when Christ was born, and it was a common belief that really important individuals often died on the day of their conception. Considering Jesus is held to have died around the Jewish celebration of Passover, early Christians dated the death of Christ to March 25 (or sometimes April 6), and the Feast of the Annunciation is still celebrated on this date. Hence 9 months after gave them the date. The winter solstice is the basis for the dating in non-Christian and Christian winter holidays, because Passover is fixed in relation to the Spring Equinox, not because of pagan traditions.\n\nSo, a clear case of bad history, right? Well, even though submissions are allowed as sources, Jooseman got this fact from\n\n&gt; the answers that are usually given by flaired users on /r/askhistorians about it.\n\n... which is fine for that submission, but too much of a game of telephone for my post, as I haven't seen these flaired posts myself. So, I did some research, and this hypothesis is described by Andrew McGowan in the article [How December 25 Became Christmas](http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/new-testament/how-december-25-became-christmas/), which first appeared in Bible Review, December 2002. \n\nAccording to him, the connection to paganism appeared long after the birth of Jesus:\n\n&gt;It’s not until the 12th century that we find the first suggestion that Jesus’ birth celebration was deliberately set at the time of pagan feasts. A marginal note on a manuscript of the writings of the Syriac biblical commentator Dionysius bar-Salibi states that in ancient times the Christmas holiday was actually shifted from January 6 to December 25 so that it fell on the same date as the pagan Sol Invictus holiday.5 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Bible scholars spurred on by the new study of comparative religions latched on to this idea.6 They claimed that because the early Christians didn’t know when Jesus was born, they simply assimilated the pagan solstice festival for their own purposes, claiming it as the time of the Messiah’s birth and celebrating it accordingly.\n\nOther Christmas traditions which do have connection to paganism came much later, and added to the confusion:\n\n&gt;More recent studies have shown that many of the holiday’s modern trappings do reflect pagan customs borrowed much later, as Christianity expanded into northern and western Europe. The Christmas tree, for example, has been linked with late medieval druidic practices. This has only encouraged modern audiences to assume that the date, too, must be pagan.\n\nEven though Christianity did borrow pagan dates and activities later in its life, it seems unlikely that it happened in the early centuries:\n\n&gt;But we don’t have evidence of Christians adopting pagan festivals in the third century, at which point dates for Christmas were established. Thus, it seems unlikely that the date was simply selected to correspond with pagan solar festivals.\n\nThe hypothesis of the date of conception has been proposed by Thomas Talley:\n\n&gt;Connecting Jesus’ conception and death in this way will certainly seem odd to modern readers, but it reflects ancient and medieval understandings of the whole of salvation being bound up together. One of the most poignant expressions of this belief is found in Christian art. In numerous paintings of the angel’s Annunciation to Mary—the moment of Jesus’ conception—the baby Jesus is shown gliding down from heaven on or with a small cross (see photo above of detail from Master Bertram’s Annunciation scene); a visual reminder that the conception brings the promise of salvation through Jesus’ death.\n\nIf I were an actual historian, I would have cited more direct sources, but this is all I can do. What do you think, (actual) historians of reddit? Bad history or good history?\n",

The Mongols attacked the Indian subcontinent several times from 1221 to 1327. Parts of Pakistan and the Punjab were controlled for decades. \n\nThe Mongols were able to subjugate Southern China, which has a tropical climate and is humid. So they had no problems fighting in those conditions. Nonetheless, the Mongols were pushed back by the Delhi Sultanate. \n\nOf course, our friend might have meant the humid parts of India however the comment simply says India.\n\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_India\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe#End_of_the_Mongol_advance\n\n&gt;they probably would have stopped as they started getting into heavy the forests of continental Europe since it clashed so heavily with the ideal steppe warfare they were steamrolling everyone with.\n\nHere I'll link a comment on /r/askhistorians by a Mongol Empire expert:\n\n&gt;One thing to bear in mind, which we often lose sight of in the West, is that Europe was not considered very important to those living in Asia and the Middle East. European states were not considered a threat or much of an opportunity in the period.\n\n&gt;The classic example of this is the crusades: Undergraduate Middle Eastern history classes are often told to disregard much of what they know of the crusades. For the Middle East they were neither epoch-changing or particularly threatening. The Levant was something of a backwater at the time, and the skirmishes with the Christian West were nothing compared to the very serious influxes of invaders from the Turkish and Mongol steppes.\n\n&gt;That is to say that Europe was likely never at the top of Mongol priorities. It was comparatively poor, quite divided, and held no institutions of major contemporary note (major empires, patriarchates, calipahtes - the Catholic Papacy was not particularly powerful in the eyes of the East).\n\n&gt;The Mongols would have been able to sack Europe, but the grander civilisations of East Asia and the Middle East, and the closer one of Russia seem to have been more important to them, and given just how small the core Mongol force was (probably far less than 100,000 Mongols overall, with Turkish and other allies), they were likely too resource-poor in leadership to divert Mongols away from Asian campaigns.\n\n* [/u/alltorndown](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/rcfut/how_close_were_the_mongols_to_sacking_europe/c4513v7)\n\n&gt;The few battles they did fight in Hungary and Poland did show they weren't exactly lacking in prowess on their home turf, though.\n\nCredit where credit is due. \n\n",

        "text": "So I was browsing about as we all do, and saw a post on why [Tamriel (the world of the Elder Scrolls series of video games) has not experienced an industrial revolution and is, instead, degenerating](http://np.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2zq1o4/why_hasnt_tamriel_had_an_industrial_revolution/cplb6po).\n\nI know this is a bit dubious for Bad history--I mean, fictional world, fictional history!--but I have something to get off my chest that is related, and you guys are just gonna have to deal with it or walk.\n\nFirst off, our friends, the bads.\n\nWe have: Agriculture is the start of civilization!\n\n&gt;Herbology has been a staple of human society for pretty much all ten millenia I'm using as the figure for \"civilization's lifetime\", since the start point – 8000 BC – is the rise of agriculture.\n\nI don't know that this is such a terrible statement (someone help me with ag dates?) but I take issue with the implication that \"agriculture\" and \"herbology\" (or herbalism) are the same thing. I'm not sure exactly what all is meant by \"herbology\", but if it is what I think of, people have had some level of awareness of what plants to eat and what parts for a long time, much longer than we have been cultivating them in agriculture. Just a bit of false conflation (and Civ V's tech tree starts with Agriculture, so...)\n\nWe have: Teleological Technology!\n\n&gt;Recorded history on Tamriel is exactly 6954 years old. Human society on earth is ~10,000 years old. The Industrial Revolution was 200 years ago. Even if Tamriel followed in lockstep with Earth, which it doesn't, **they've got three millenia to spare before they're seriously off schedule.**\n\nWe've talked before about how no event is predetermined as far as we are concerned with history, so to imply that there is some kind of \"schedule\" to time is a bit strange. Still, in a fictional timeline I guess you can do whatever you want, including putting a stopwatch on emergent developments. This one I take the least issue with.\n\nWe have: The Fall of Rome (with extra-special bonus CDA^tm strengthening agent!)!\n\n&gt;This one (studying advanced tech from previous civilizations) (is) harder to pin down to Earth analogues, since there are very few periods of technological collapse and recovery. The easiest one for me to use is, of course, the Roman Empire and Medieval Europe.\n\n&gt;The Western Roman Empire fell in early 400s AD, and the Italian Renaissance opened in 1400 AD. In the intervening millenium, Rome's technology was regarded as basically how Tamriel sees the Dwemer – wonderful, miraculous, and lost. Just like in the Medieval period, there are far more immediate concerns than reverse engineering on a grand scale, because Tamriel, like Medieval Europe, is kind of a shitshow.\n\nI'm still waiting for a good example of something the Romans did that everyone forgot, excluding maybe concrete, that was not replicated on the basis of lost knowledge. Maybe I'm just forgetting something, I'm not an expert on this; however, I am sure that it is ridiculous to claim that anyone in the middle ages looked at what the Romans had made with the kind of awe that they would have for animated brass automatons and energizing crystals that can hold people's souls. Not to mention the \"shit was whack, yo\" about pre-Renaissance Europe. \n\nThere's also a bit on Feudalism, but his point gets at the nebulousness of feudalism well enough that I won't quote or call out his usage. We've talked about how \"feudalism\" is more of a scholar's idea of how things worked than a real thing that existed, so I think we can let this one go (this is, incidentally, my best pick for \"Ok badhistory\"; I really don't mind this misconception of Medieval European politics, because I think it encourages more interest than it misinforms, it's easily debunked for people with simple conversations, and it doesn't give harmful platforms like racist apologia or revisionism can).\n\nThis is where I want to step away from the badhistory peanut gallery to talk about [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools).\n\nFeudal Europe is a misconception, yes; but it is also a trope, and one that allows a writer to create a world that even the least educated layperson can understand at least at the start. In the linked post at the top, the fictional world of Tamriel is described as \"feudal\", but the way any of the politcal systems work is completely different in practice from the basic concept of \"feudalism\". The creators of the world used Feudalism as a diving board to create a huge tapestry of different political systems, all based off of differing ideologies of the natives of a region and influenced by the historical power shifts of the world.\n\nIf your understanding of Feudalism is based off of this game, you will know it is a completely useless term to describe anything in detail, because it really only describes the most basic idea of \"one guy has more power than a few guys who have more power than most everyone else\". You've got a system where three houses compete for influence over demi-god rulers, each house with a separate method of rule (intrigue, might, wizardry); you've got king&gt;landlords&gt;peasants, except the peasants can influence the lords and the lords can dethrone the king, and etc.\n\nIf I come into this world with a notion of feudalism as a real thing that happened, it's not unreasonable that the richness of this world will make me think more about how I see the world, especially if someone tries to tell me that the only difference between Morrowind's Aristocratic system and Cyrodiil's is what they call the nobility and I know of course it isn't; no way. An Emperor beholden to a council of regents is nothing like demigods playing mortal landowners against each other!\n\nI think that there is a certain amount of value that can be had in these tropes based on simplifications and misunderstandings of history; not only entertainment value or a chance to exercise our pedantry in safety, but also as a way to introduce people to the broader ideas of how history works. The problem with pedantry is that it alienates anyone not willing or able to enter the \"in\" group, and sometimes that inability can be caused simply by being the object of ridicule instead of a subject in dialogue. The more we can connect the way the real world works in people's minds, the easier it is to actually make headway in the way people think.\n\nI'm sure this won't make obsolete the stormfronts of the world, nor is this method going to work on your /u/drooperdoo s and /u/CoachBradB s; but I would like to see someone try to tell me not only how a swords-and-sandals movie deals with history poorly, but maybe how you can get some truth out of the misunderstandings. Let's get meta on this, leverage Game of Thrones and Assassin's Creed to teach instead of just holding on in the face of the bad parts and snickering in our (admittedly excellent and entertaining) pedantic corner.\n\nMaybe I've got too much faith in humanity right now, but I don't think that's a flaw here.\n\n\nEdit via /u/cuddles_the_destroye: &gt;[To be fair to the writer, he is at least aware his comparisons to actual earth history isn't super accurate] (http://np.reddit.com/r/DepthHub/comments/2zrgjt/umyrrlyn_outlines_the_technological_progression/cplo9yo) \n\nTL;DR: Dwemer tech is totes meta(l)\n \nEdits for formatting fail",

        "text": "&gt;Competitive Walking was the most popular spectator sport in America before baseball.\n\nYes, it's [this comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2zidlf/til_in_the_early_1900s_6day_long_bicycle_races/cpj7nmw) that makes this bold claim.  \n\nThe person making the comment has linked to [this article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/competitive-walking-was-the-national-pastime-until-baseball-came-along/2014/03/30/f3e3a93a-aabe-11e3-adbc-888c8010c799_story.html) in the washington post, but the washington post has been criticized for [peddling bs news before,](https://www.google.co.in/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=tQ4LVbD3A6TO8geQpYHYBw&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=cracked.com+bs+news+washington+post) which makes me somewhat suspicious regarding the veracity of its articles.(Yes, I know it's cracked.com which is doing the criticizing, but I'm still gonna take washington post articles with a grain of salt unless I get verification elsewhere)  \n\nI'll also add the badhistory from the washington post article:\n&gt;But just a decade later, pedestrianism was dead. By then, charges of race fixing and doping had diluted fan interest. During one race in 1876, the famous pedestrian Edward Payson Weston was caught chewing coca leaves — a practice that was considered unsportsmanlike, if not outright cheating.\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, baseball was on the rise. The National League, founded as a ragtag enterprise in 1876, became a stable, profitable business after team owners imposed a $2,500 salary cap in 1885. Of the eight clubs in the league in 1890, only one, the Cleveland Spiders, no longer exists. The other seven clubs were, and still are, the Braves, Cubs, Dodgers, Giants, Phillies, Pirates and Reds. Fans who once had flocked to six-day races instead filled spacious new wooden ballparks. \n\nSo, after doing some fact-checking on Wikipedia, I realized that the [article on competitive walking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racewalking) (which Wikipedia calls racewalking) doesn't mention the word \"baseball\" at all(a quick ctrl+f search helps). In fact, one of the citations there links to [this article on npr,](http://www.npr.org/2014/04/03/297327865/in-the-1870s-and-80s-being-a-pedestrian-was-anything-but) which I'll use to refute the badhistory quoted.  \n\nSee, the article on washington post does not even care to mention the rise of bicycling as a popular sport, which is a pretty egregious omission, given that bicycling was the actual reason for the decline in the popularity of competitive walking. Here, let me quote npr for you:  \n\n&gt;**On how bicycles took over pedestrianism as the popular spectator sport**\n\n&gt;In 1885, an Englishman named John Starley invented what is called the safety bicycle. Before the safety bicycle, bicycles were the penny farthings — with the ginormous front wheel and the tiny little back wheel. And the penny farthings weren't very nimble or fast, but the safety bicycle, which is the bicycle we know today, these were much more nimble, much faster and they were much more interesting to watch race around a track for six days than the pedestrians just walking.\n\n&gt;It sort of went from a NASCAR at superslow motion to a NASCAR at slow motion. And the other advantage of the bicycle races is that especially at the end, when the competitors were completely sleep deprived, there would be spectacular crashes, and of course the crowd enjoyed that a lot.\n\nTo washington post and the redditor I quoted: Do a bit more research. What you stated implies that baseball was the reason behind the decline of the popularity of competitive walking as a sport, which is a pretty bullshit argument.  \n\nEdit: Changed a link.  \n\nEdit 2: Quoted the badhistory from the washington post article as well.",

        "text": "This was a personally experienced example, so I hope that although I can't furnish proof in the form of a link it will still be acceptable.\n\nI fence at a local fencing club that teaches and competes in modern fencing, as well as a variety of historical styles. It's a pretty laid back environment in general, but there are those of us that take ourselves too seriously.\n\nOne such gentleman we'll call Joe. Joe shows up every week like clockwork and never actively fences, he just shows people - usually new people who haven't learned to avoid him - \"cool things\" that you can do with a longsword, or whatever weapon-of-the-week he's into.\n\nThis week, it was Chinese longswords, which brings me to badhistory example 1: \"These are the correct length, but not the correct *height*\" Joe explained. \"What you have to remember is that people back then were a lot shorter than we are today,\" holding his hand up to about chin-height, \"and the Chinese were even shorter than that.\"\n\nRight, because every person born today is way taller than anyone ever was \"back in the day.\" And Chinese people! Forget about it. Practically halflings, right? It's not as if there was [extreme variability](http://hubpages.com/hub/Myths-and-misconceptions-about-history-people-were-shorter-back-then) in height throughout [historical periods and between different countries](https://historymyths.wordpress.com/2014/03/23/revised-myth-8-beds-were-shorter-back-then-because-people-were-shorter/) or anything, based on diet, lifestyle, and health or anything. People were just shorter, always. This is a particularly aggravating myth, because it doesn't take thirty seconds of effort to find out that the reality is [a lot more interesting and nuanced](https://books.google.com/books?id=3JVGoChXKRwC&amp;pg=PT40&amp;lpg=PT40&amp;dq=people+were+shorter+back+then&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DgQSXpAtlU&amp;sig=XsEZPcmawo-NFaK4z8m7VWk84U0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=de4KVfGBK_j-sATDiIKIBg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=people%20were%20shorter%20back%20then&amp;f=false) than just \"people were short.\" \n\nBut, alright. It's an innocuous mistake, and it might take a specific desire to tackle that particular myth to go out and research it, and not everyone has the time or inclination for it, fair deuce. It's also persistent as all hell, repeated in every corner of military and pseudo-historical gaming circles, places that often don't encourage citations. So it's likely that he's heard it repeated so often it became axiomatic, and he's decided that it's true. Whatever.\n\nHis second major example of badhistory is so confounding I can't even fathom where the hell it came from or how it would even be possible to believe.\n\n\"Now, with Western weapon development, we go from copper, to bronze, to iron, and then to steel, right?\" Joe began. \"With that kind of development, we see swords getting longer little by little. The Chinese, though, went right from copper to steel. So they got much longer swords a lot earlier than Europeans.\"\n\nWut. Wut? Wuuuuut. I didn't even know how to take this one. They *skipped bronze and iron*? How is that even possible? \n\nSo, never mind that [bronze is actually a superior metal](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2ai53y/when_did_iron_effectively_make_bronze_obsolete/civil23) to [iron and to steel in some respects](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2ai53y/when_did_iron_effectively_make_bronze_obsolete/civhur7), let's tackle the idea that the Chinese went straight from copper to steel.\n\n[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Goujian) [are](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2748722/Chinese-boy-stumbles-3-000-year-old-bronze-sword-hands-river-wash-them.html) [numerous](http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/focus/weaponry-bronze.htm) examples of [Chinese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_swords) weapons and artifacts of the bronze age. There is also, you know, the extremely thoroughly researched [Chinese Bronze Age](http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_4000bce_bronze.htm). And the idea that going from copper to steel meant the Chinese adopted long swords sooner than Europeans? There might be some truth to longer swords making an earlier appearance in China, owing to the differences in social structure, economic conditions, and martial development, but to assume this Civ-like adherence to Conjectural development - gotta unlock steel before your swords can get longer! - is anything other than an example of social and historical nuances is mind-boggling.\n\nAt this point I'm not even sure if the weapon he was showing off is a [Miaodao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miaodao) or a [Zhanmadao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhanmadao) and I'm pretty sure Joe has no clue, either. And considering he wasn't specific with what time period he was dealing with - sometime after the copper age, i guess! - it's even more difficult to parse through his crap. At one point he may have said \"14th century\" which would put it at the exact same time that [various](http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Hans_Talhoffer) [European](http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Johannes_Liechtenauer) [masters](http://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Hans_D%C3%B6bringer) were writing elaborate and detailed martial treatises that described the use of long swords that are only slightly smaller than the miaodao/zhanmadao he was describing.\n\nIt took all of my power not to [Lana-slap](https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/slaps-2.gif?w=650&amp;h=365) the guy.\n\nIt was a long night.\n\nEDIT: Corrected some of the links to the /r/AskHistorians thread to make the interesting bits a little more apparent.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2zetgo/why_has_america_been_able_to_advance_so_swiftly/",
        "text": "Many of you have undoubtedly seen the latest post on [r/todayilearned](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/). I am here to provide your daily breakdown of exactly why [this TIL](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2zdtql/til_america_has_been_at_war_for_222_out_of_239/) is so egregiously and unforgiveably wrong. Before we can even begin to talk about *why* this is wrong, we need to decide on what our definition of a war actually is. This is a surprisingly difficult question. Academics have long used specific definitions suited only to restricted categories of conflicts. No *academic* definition of war was widely accepted until the founding of the Correlates of War (**COW**) project in the mid-80s. I will use the **COW** definition for the remainder of this discussion. A full discussion of *why* this particular definition was selected and how it has changed over time can be found [here](http://cow.la.psu.edu/COW2%20Data/WarData_NEW/COW%20Website%20-%20Typology%20of%20war.pdf)\n\nThe **COW** definition has a few important criteria:\n\n* There must be a prolonged period of sustained conflict. \n* Active participation in battle of regular armed forces on one or more sides.\n* An average of 1,000 annual battle related deaths during the conflict. \n\nThe last of these is merely a guideline. A year with 997 deaths would not preclude a war from inclusion, but a conflict that never rises above double digits casualties would certainly not be considered.\n\nLet us compare this definition to that of our dear OP\n\n&gt; If we dedicate money and soldiers to help another country, I'd classify that as being at war.\n\nBy this definition, the US soldiers was at war with Haiti in 2010 and Indonesia in 2004-2005. US soldiers were sent to aid Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and the infamous Indonesian tsunami in Operations [Unified Response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unified_Response) and [Unified Assistance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Unified_Assistance). I may be [jumping the gun here](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/18/haiti-earthquake-us-soldiers-aid), but I feel confident no one would legitimately consider these wars.\n\n\n*****\n\nLet us now move onto the meat of Wikipedia's list:\n\n* 1791-1794 - Whiskey Rebellion\n\nThe Whiskey rebellion manages to meet exactly one of the **COW** criteria, namely the requirement for regular armed forces. The militia of Virgina, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania were all involved in the suppression of the rebellion. However there was no period of sustained conflict nor were there enough deaths in any year to justify naming it a war.\n\n* 1798-1800 – Quasi-War\n\nAs before, we cannot consider the Quasi-War a war under our definition. While it does have a prolonged period of sustained combat between regular armed forces, it does not nearly meet casualty considerations.\n\n* 1820-1875 - Texas-Indian wars\n\nAlthough this range is commonly given for the conflict against the Comanche, I would personally argue that it is not a war at all. At various points the conflict was virtually non-existent for months or years at a time. It was also not consistently qualified by the mobilization of regular warriors on any side. This was an incredibly important, existential series of conflicts between the fledgling United States and Native groups. It was not however a war.\n\n* 1823 - Arikara War \n\nAlthough the Arikara War is an important event in US history, it was neither prolonged nor extensive enough to meet our definition of war.\n\n* 1825-1828 - Aegean Anti-piracy Operations \n\nI'm not going to reject this one based on the definition, although it certainly does not fit. I'm going to reject it based on the fact that anti-piracy has been a mainstay of naval powers for centuries. If we included them, every naval power for the past 30 or so centuries would have been constantly at war. \n\n* 1827 – Winnebago War\n\nThis war does not come even close to the **COW** definition, since only 20 deaths occurred, all of which were during a period of 3 days between June 28 - June 30.\n\n* 1832 - First Sumatran expedition\n\nAlthough questionably moral and/or legal, bombarding a single village is not a sustained conflict. \n\n* 1838-1842 - United States Exploring Expedition\n\nLet us simply look at the name. It's regrettable that people died, but it was not a war involving regular military, prolonged conflict, or sufficient casualties.\n\n* 1847-1855 - Cayuse War\n\nAlthough this one does not involve nearly enough casualties, it's for the reason of a lack of regular organized forces that I'm rejecting this one. The Cayuse had been devastated by plague in years previously and simply did not have 1000 people to die. This is a pattern that became common in later Indian wars, especially the...\n\n* 1851–1900 - Apache Wars\n\nDon't want to include 1825? 1837? What about 1849? I genuinely do not understand why Wikipedia has this misleading date range. Although Cochise's conflict is important, it was an evolution of previous low level conflict going back decades. It has many of the same definitional problems as the Comanche wars I discussed earlier. However, the surrender of Geronimo in 1886 was the effective end of major conflict. Extending the period to 1900 (not [1896](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Campaign_(1896\\))?) makes absolutely no sense. \n\n* 1856–1857 – Filibuster War\n\nNo.\n\n* 1856 - Watermelon War\n\nTook a single day, involved no military, and had no battle-related casualties. Looks like we have our first entry that definitively does not meet a *single* criterion.\n\n* 1857-1858 - Utah War\n\nNo battles, no war.\n\n* 1858-1866 - Navajo Wars\n\nAs with the Apache and the Comanche, the Navajo wars exist in a grey area between low level conflicts and open war.\n\n* 1859-1861 - Cortina Wars\n\nThe Cortina conflicts are quite interesting in and of themselves, but one would struggle to consider them an actual war and yet somehow exclude the [Pima War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuma_War), which is omitted from wikipedia's list.\n\n* 1860 - Paiute War\n\nSee criterion #3.\n\n* 1861–1875 - Yavapai Wars\n\nSee: earlier Indian Wars discussion.\n\n* 1863-1864 - Shimonoseki War\n\nThe lack of sustained conflict and casualties are what disqualify this was a war. \n\n\n* 1865-1867 - French intervention in Mexico (part 2)\n\nThe US did not have military forces involved in this conflict. They supported local mexican rebels, but the primary method of American intervention was diplomatic.\n\n* 1871 - United States expedition to Korea\n\nDoes not meet criteria #1 and #3.\n\n* 1874-1875 - Red River War\n\nI'm getting tired of writing the same tired criticism of Wikipedia's treatment of the Indian Wars. I'll skip these from now on.\n\n* 1875 - Las Cuevas War\n\nMobilization of regular forces, sustained conflict, casualties. We have another ringer!\n\n* 1893 - Hawaiian coup\n\nCoups do not count as wars in any definition I've ever seen.\n\n* 1910-1919 - Mexican Revolution (including Border wars)\n\nThis is another series of conflicts that fall into a grey area. On one hand, the US did mobilize regular forces to deal with revolutionaries and border issues. On the other, there was no continuous series of battles that can be called a distinct war. It's very much an ambiguous set of conflicts loosely grouped under a single name. You could argue the point either way, but it's here that I feel the **COW** definition fails to capture the idea of war most.\n\n* ~~1982-1984 - UN intervention in Lebanon~~\n\n~~The US' role in the Lebanon peacekeeping operation was to enable the withdrawal of the PLO with limited combat objectives. Although it does involve regular military forces, there's little else about it that could be called a war.~~\n\nI'd just like to leave everyone with what I feel is the best comment from the linked thread:\n\n&gt; The United States was founded on the principle of spreading freedom (or as it was named then, Christianity). Everyone needed to be a part of this whether they knew it or not. Time passed and parts of the world resisted or were untouchable for various reasons. So the slow political spread of the American empire began. Exerting control over countries from a distance, letting them believe they still have an identity. - [/u/quiteintriguing](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2zdtql/til_america_has_been_at_war_for_222_out_of_239/cpi2541)\n\n*****\n\nEDIT: [/u/Clovis69](http://www.reddit.com/user/Clovis69) has pointed out that the [MNF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_Force_in_Lebanon) is not the same as the [UNIFIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Interim_Force_in_Lebanon).",

To make it up to all you losers (or, savvy winners) we'll be introducing the bank. Here's how it'll work\n\n## **Bank Rules**\n\n1. The bank will offer up all loses from the previous round to be loaned out to whomever wants it whether they be a new player, someone who just went bankrupt, or someone who is doing relatively well.\n2. You cannot take more than a fifth of whatever is in the bank. This means that whomever gets to the bank will get the lion's share of whatever's there.\n3. The money you owe the bank will automatically be deducted from your winnings. \n4. In addition to repaying your debts,you will be required to pay a certain percentage of your winnings to the bank. In round 2, you will have to pay the bank 20% of your winnings, in round 3 you will have to pay 30%, in round 4 it will be increased to 40% etc until the final round where you will be expected to 60% of your winnings to the bank should you win. \n5. If you have horrible luck and manage to go into the negatives you have two choices: you can either a) attempt to get some cash from the bank and try to to bet on something that will reduce or remove your debt, or b) you can wait to have your kneecaps broken by /u/hussard_de_la_mort.\n\n**Current Bank Balance:** ~~$5,444~~ ~~$4356~~ ~~$3485~~ $2788\n\n**Current Loans**\n\n* /u/Turnshroud - $1088\n* /u/Dirish - $871\n* /u/pathein_mathein - $697\n\n## **Betting Pool Rules**\n\n1. Newbies start with $1000. If you were part of the last round, please check [the leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AhlC2ixYfOBQeF1GiWwpcJzs57KEpO1mfmDh1Ah3-ak/edit#gid=0) to see your current balance. Your bets should be based off of your most current balance. \n2. During each round, you'll get a chance to place your bets on whatever player is you like, under whatever circumstances you like, whether you're betting that someone will go to finals, or betting that someone will just make it to the next round.\n3. Bets are **nonrefundable**, and no take backsies so choose wisely. Once iot's on the board, it's on the board\n4. You can add money to the put if you already placed a bet, but you can't take it out (just let me know if you adjusted your bet).\n5. Once you hit $0, or the negatives, you're no longer eligible to bet unless you recieve a loan from a generous player, or the bank. \n\nWith that said, HAVE AT IT!\n\n\n\n## **To be Determined in Future Rounds**\n\n* /u/Turnshroud bets $100 that Holocaust Denial will make it to the semi-finals \n* /u/Dirish thinks the odds are that the Hawaiian dreadnoughts will make it to finals \n* /u/MuppyP bets $100 that the worst source will be an annoying, book-writing pseudo-historian from the twentieth century.\n* /u/EmperorOfMeow bets $500 that the Phantom Time hypothesis will make it to the semi-finals \n* /u/HyenaDandy bets $500 that Holocaust Denial will make it to finals\n* /u/HyenaDandy bets $50 on the Chart and the Dark Ages meeting each-other\n* /u/_watching bets  $100 that Jared Diamond and drooperdoo will face off against each other\n* /u/Cpt_Tripps bets $1000 that Jesus Truther's meets THE Chart in the round of 8, and that the Chart moves on to the final 4.\n",

        "text": "*With the new moratorium, new atheist bad history returns.*\n\nSo I was browsing /r/changemyview the other day, and I met someone who declared that [\"Religion isn't necessary in the Information Age.\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2z1ves/cmv_religion_isnt_necessary_in_the_information_age/) The entire post seems unsuited to a subreddit literally named *Change my view*, given that he ends his introduction with this:\n\n&gt;  So here goes my little rant, I hope this finds its way onto a person's monitor who is looking for some reason to drop religion but just can't seem to find one.\n\nSurprise, surprise - he makes some dumb errors on the way. \n\n&gt; 6) I have read and seen a lot of these conspiracy theories out there on the net and honestly I believe most of them are crap. I did come across one that stated Christianity was copied from ancient Egyptian religion. I read about how the ten commandments were a copy of a section in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. I was a little skeptical at first so I decided to order the book. I went to amazon and purchased a copy of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Guess what? They weren't lying. The similarities between the ten commandments and the Egyptian version were too similar for coincidence.\n\n&gt; Jesus actually appears to be a carbon copy of the Egyptian god Horus. This particular information cannot be found in any history books and that what the bible thumpers will fight back with BUT they are found in the pyramids of Luxor, directly inscribed on the walls. They hieroglyphs say that the virgin Isis (Virgin Mary) was impregnated by the holy ghost of Neth, impregnating Isis.\n\n&gt; Noah was also a plagiarism of belief system before its time. There are over 200 claims of the great flood before Noah's time with other figures similar to Noah, a good example is Gilgamesh which was written in 2600 BC. It talks about a flood and an ark with animals on it..etc you get the picture. If anyone wants this information leave a message and I can send you sources or you can just google it yourself. Once you start researching pre-Christian beliefs you will start finding so many similarities you will be amazed.\n\n[When even /r/atheism concedes that atheists shouldn't use the Horus - Jesus \"connection\" as an argument](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1y7ux6/horusjesus_this_myth_needs_to_stop_being_part_of/) something is probably seriously wrong. \n&gt; I have read and seen a lot of these conspiracy theories out there on the net and honestly I believe most of them are crap. I did come across one that stated Christianity was copied from ancient Egyptian religion. I read about how the ten commandments were a copy of a section in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. I was a little skeptical at first so I decided to order the book. I went to amazon and purchased a copy of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Guess what? They weren't lying. The similarities between the ten commandments and the Egyptian version were too similar for coincidence.\n\nI couldn't find any good sources on this supposed Egyptian origin of the Ten Commandments, so people are welcome to clarify on this. However, I just want to say that [a search for \"Egypt ten commandments origin\"](https://www.google.com/search?q=egypt%20ten%20commandments&amp;rct=j#q=egypt+ten+commandments+origin) yields [this](https://sites.google.com/site/religionsciencevsfaith/home/forbidden-knowledge-christianity-plagiarized-from-ancient-egypt/the-ten-commandments-and-the-egyptian-book-of-the-dead) as the top result. To see why it's bullshit, just look at the left sidebar of this site. Meanwhile, the second top result is [this](http://www.trinicenter.com/kwame/2009/1812.htm), which claims that Egyptians were black, saying that \"in the B.C. era, ALL the Gods were Black; now in the A.D. era, ALL the Gods are White. This represents European religious power-control supremacy at its zenith.\" So...I wouldn't put much stock into this claim that the Ten Commandments were Egyptian.\n\n&gt; Jesus actually appears to be a carbon copy of the Egyptian god Horus. This particular information cannot be found in any history books and that what the bible thumpers will fight back with BUT they are found in the pyramids of Luxor, directly inscribed on the walls. They hieroglyphs say that the virgin Isis (Virgin Mary) was impregnated by the holy ghost of Neth, impregnating Isis.\n\nFirst, if you can't find your pet hypothesis in reliable history books, maybe it's because it's *wrong*, and not because there's a conspiracy of Christians in historical academia to censure the Truth?\n\nSecond, Jesus is not \"a carbon copy\" of Horus, as even /r/atheism admits. [This article](http://www.jonsorensen.net/2012/10/25/horus-manure-debunking-the-jesushorus-connection/) explains it well, but there are other conspicuous reasons why since Jesus isn't a carbon copy of Horus. Jesus is [not depicted with a bird's head](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Horus_standing.svg), for one. Nor is Satan (who I guess would be the equivalent of Set) believed to have [killed God and sliced Him up into pieces.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth#Death_and_resurrection_of_Osiris) And AFAIK, [Christians also do not believe that Satan tried to have sex with Jesus, nor do they believe that Jesus injured or stole Satan's testicles.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth#Conflict_of_Horus_and_Set)\n\nThird, there are no real pyramids in Luxor; the tombs in the Valley of the Kings, which was the Theban necropolis for pharaohs and major nobles, are not pyramids. The only pyramids in Luxor are [minuscule pyramids](http://www.luxor4u.com/archaeological/photos/deir_el_medina5.jpg) in the workmen's village [Deir el-Medina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_el-Medina), built *for* the tomb workers. I don't think pyramids built for workers are what this guy had in mind here.\n\nFourth, I really doubt that the Egyptians believed Isis was impregnated by the spirit of Neth. There are two reasons. \n\nFirst, Horus being the son of Osiris is the [*center of the entire myth of Horus defeating Set and avenging Osiris his father*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_myth). So if this guy is correct that the Egyptians believed Horus was the son of Neth and Isis, I want to know how the same Egyptians also believed in a myth *completely based on Horus being Osiris's son.*\n\nThe second, and more conspicuous, reason I doubt that this guy's claim is because, well, [Neth, or Nut, happens to be a sky *goddess.*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_(deity)) I think the Egyptians understood enough about sex to realize that a woman, even a goddess, should not be able to impregnate another woman. \n\n&gt; Noah was also a plagiarism of belief system before its time. There are over 200 claims of the great flood before Noah's time with other figures similar to Noah, a good example is Gilgamesh which was written in 2600 BC. It talks about a flood and an ark with animals on it..etc you get the picture. If anyone wants this information leave a message and I can send you sources or you can just google it yourself. Once you start researching pre-Christian beliefs you will start finding so many similarities you will be amazed.\n\nQuoting the entirety of [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ees52/how_did_the_story_of_gilgamesh_become_the_genesis/c9zkyft) in /r/AskHistorians, a response to the question \"How did the story of Gilgamesh become the Genesis flood?\" (Emphasis mine)\n\n&gt; The short answer is: it almost certainly didn't. Many diverse cultures all over the world have flood myths which, at a quick glance, look astonishingly similar; there's rarely a good basis for drawing a line between two specific ones and saying \"this one is derived from that one\".\n\n&gt; I hasten to add that this doesn't just go for the flood story. There are *many* stories with an amazing geographical spread (and which can't be blamed on modern dissemination). Another well-known one is the \"hunter gets trapped in a cave by a monstrous giant, blinds the giant, and escapes by hiding under the belly of one of the giant's herd animals\" story, which crops up all over Eurasia and North America. Or the \"sailor and the oar\" story. Or many, many other folktales.\n\n&gt; In the specific case of the flood story it is reasonable to consider whether we should be thinking of a single underlying story-type that gave rise to both the *Genesis* and *Gilgamesh* (and dozens of other) versions, or instead of a story that naturally emerges from conditions that exist everywhere in the world (pretty much everyone knows what a flood is). As a methodological principle, the former looks more likely in cases where distinctive motifs reappear in multiple versions; if the similarity lies only in generalities, then the \"convergent\" model is indicated.\n\n&gt; In the *Genesis* and *Gilgamesh* cases, it's the former (the most distinctive motif is the use of a bird to determine when the flood is subsiding; even that has been subjected to doubt, on the hypothesis that birds might imaginably have actually been used that way in ancient Near Eastern navigation, but that's a big stretch).* **But that just shows a common origin for both stories (and for other flood stories), not derivation of one from the other.**\n\n&gt; \\*EDIT: maybe not quite such a stretch as I had imagined. Apparently there *is* evidence of birds being used in exactly this way. See George's critical edition of *Gilgamesh*, vol. 1, pp. 516-518 for discussion\n\nSo, saying that Gilgamesh became the Genesis Flood is like saying that Hindi became English. They have the same root, but they are different things, and \"not derivation of one from the other.\"",

Chili dishes in China are a distinctly early modern invention because chilis come from America. It's been said that Ma La (the pairing of chilis and the Sichuan peppercorn) is a [19th or 20th Century invention.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mala_sauce) This is the equivalent of talking about how \"the Ancient American George Washington defeated the British.\" \n\nNormally, I would ignore something like this from a food blog, but it's part of a pattern I keep seeing in which everything remotely old in China is called \"ancient.\" \n\n[Here's another example](http://www.iflscience.com/technology/ct-scans-reveal-mummy-inside-statue) where they talk about scraps of paper from 1100 AD/CE with the scraps printed \"with yet to be deciphered ancient Chinese characters.\" If you're not familiar with the development of Chinese characters, [check out Table 2 on page 5.](http://yalepress.yale.edu/languages/pdf/Yin_chapter1.pdf) As you can see, the script had been essentially the same (with some handwriting variation) for 2000 years before simplified characters were introduced in the last century. I'm not sure anything from 1100 can be called \"ancient,\" but you certainly can't say \"yet to be deciphered ancient Chinese characters.\" They just haven't been read yet. \n\nThank you for indulging my rant.",
