        "text": "Hi there,\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts about the following. It seems that a lot of depressed lawyers out there went to law school (and law) because (i) they were expecting to do altruistic work; (ii) they thought it would be easy money; (iii) a false perception of what lawyers do (based on movies or *The Firm*); (iv) no other options.\n\nNevertheless, I'm curious to hear about a specific type of people, namely those who went into law and had an extremely business-oriented approach or were profit-oriented, and how they're doing now (not in BigLaw). In my view, those people may fit those traits:\n\n1. Had the intention of starting their law firm and focusing strictly on transactional areas (corporate, real estate, insolvency, etc.)\n2. Are extremely comfortable working \\~ 70 hours weekly (and more if needed).\n3. Can understand transactions further than the legal side of it (interpreting financial statements, asset valuations, corporate finance, etc., and doing calculations if needed).\n\nI may be wrong, but it seems that many lawyers went from non-STEM degrees to law schools, and thus their commercial awareness and analytical skills are subpar when numbers are involved in transactions. Thus, in my opinion, when you can advise your client holistically then retaining clients (and building a long-term relationship) becomes easier compared to other lawyers out there that advise strictly on legal matters.\n\nAlso, curious to hear if any of you were invited to join their clients.",

It’s literally a rat race to me and it’s like I can’t help but feel every one else is just a competitor and it makes it hard to have true friends. Also it’s like everyone is trying a lot so the class average is already high to begin with instead of really helping out. Tbh I don’t rlly know how to stand out in a good way anymore bc at the end of the day we are all just IRACing it but some have the knack better than others and have superhuman typing skills.\n\nDisclaimer: I do enjoy the material content but feel like it’s more competitive than anything and this is a stress inducing factor.",

After not hearing back in November, I applied to a smaller, unpaid DA's Office nearby and accepted an offer a few weeks later. I feel horrible about potentially backing out and my Career Services Office is strongly against it, but the larger office recruits heavily from its intern class and the smaller one barely hires ADA's out of law school.

It's my last day of the week and class starts in 4 minutes and I can't get myself to go. I can always make myself at least go and show up. I can't today.

So I guess I want to make sure I’m not behind again or missing information when it comes to post-graduation employment. I have very average grade (Dean’s list last two semesters), a member of our school’s negotiation team, and have been working as a a law clerk since spring of my 1L year (2 different firms and a summer externship within the Judicial Branch of a State) so I have good experience. Should I start applying now or should I wait? Is it worth networking with big law attorneys if my grades likely don’t qualify me? Finally, how many jobs should I apply to?

And the rent is just insane. \n\n\nBut CLS has good employment outcomes and can give me a decent education albeit with more stress and less fun. No debt is a huge turn on.

I already have some  undergrad loans but the idea of taking in more is concerning me a bit. Need advice.",

        "text": "For background I'm a 2L.  I worked my 1L summer at an out-of-state midsize firm in a top legal market. I have since continued to work as a law clerk remotely there.  It's okay - this practice wasn't anything I imagined doing, but it's been a learning experience, supervisor is one of the founding partners (nice, but busy), largely remote/flexible (even for associates), and pays well for being a law clerk. \n\nThere hasn't been any discussion of potentially hiring me after graduation, but I also didn't know they were keeping me on for clerking until the last minute either.  I believe they pay new associates $130-140k'ish (based off some news article/interview of an associate I found years ago), but I'm not certain how accurate...there's no real reporting anywhere you'd normally look, and as I don't work closely with anybody besides the aforementioned partner, there's no real way to lock it down.\n\nI have since applied to a major corporation's contracts team as I had a friend that interns there &amp; likes it + everyone in the program gets an offer of employment.  I don't feel any particular way about the company, but it does seem like it is less stress/demanding &amp; the team is very nice. However, $80-90k is the starting rate.  Decent for the secondary market that I currently live in, but in a few years it still wouldn't be anywhere near what I'd potentially be making at the other firm. Also I'm a little concerned about the transferability of my experience at the company...as opposed to a traditional law firm experience....\n\nSo now I have an offer with this company for the summer (which will 100% lead to a job)...and I am still a law clerk at the midsize firm (which will run until I quit, but idk if it will lead to a job).  I know this is a personal decision, but I'm not quite sure what to do for this summer....any thoughts? suggestions?",

        "text": "I had a job about 4 years ago where my supervisor and I did not get along. There was some shady stuff going on, and I filed a union grievance against her.  She got her wrist slapped and I ended up getting pushed out. Fortunately, even though we did not see eye-to-eye, I always kept it business with her and have left her in my past.  I asked some of my friends who still work for her for her contact info so that I can list her on my NCBE application.  They told me that all these years later, my supervisor still talks about me, and not in a good way.  Apparently she has really strong negative feelings about me and is not afraid to share it.\nI know I still have to list her on my application,  but I am really anxious about what will happen if/when my state bar contacts her.  I don't think she's above making trouble for me.  What can I do to minimize the fallout?",
