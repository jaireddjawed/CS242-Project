He lives in Nashville so he heard about the Nashville Software School. I don’t know much about it, and clearly as a CS major I don’t know much about getting into software development without a degree. \n\nWhat advice should I give him? How should he go about this? Could he go back to school for a CS degree but do less semesters due to already having a different degree? Should he just self learn?",

Since then, I've dealt with a tremendous amount of anxiety and depression, and though I've been applying at different tech jobs, I worry I'm not in the right mental space to come in kicking ass as a developer, especially in a remote role (I couldn't relocate right now).\n\nHowever, currently an opportunity to teach high school math has arisen, with decent pay which would be nice for just a little bit of income. In theory I could quit whenever if I get a great gig as a developer, but I was thinking it would be nice to just do something a little different where I get to interact with people in person and help me through this terrible portion in my life, and besides, I've always wanted to teach, it's one of my passions actually. In the meantime, I could keep learning and building a portfolio and sharpening my skills as a frontend developer.\n\nSo I was thinking, if I list that I was teaching math for a semester (like until May), does this affect me negatively career wise in the eyes of tech companies? I ask because I'm in my thirties and have only had about 3.5 years of professional developer experience to this point.",

I am not really interested in a bootcamp as I have really learned most of what they teach in those on my own through freelance and personal projects.   \n\n\nAny advice would be appreciated since right now I feel totally stuck",

        "text": "I am a developer who got started later in life and without a degree in this field. I was working for a company doing help desk stuff and moved up to a developer role which I did for 5 years. The company I worked for wasn't a software company, it was an oil company that employed developers for a mix of in-house apps and to managing their 3rd party enterprise systems that had APIs for customization. In the 5 years I worked there they loved my work and were constantly giving me great performance reviews and often said I was the best developer they had.\n\nUnfortunately the pay wasn't great and so I took a job as an intermediate backend developer for a small software company and that is what I have been doing for the last 6 months. During my time here I feel constantly under pressure and being told my output is not sufficient. I work harder now then I did in my previous role and I cannot seem to get a handle on the job. It feels like they expect code from me that doesn't require any planning or debugging and so long as I can hammer out a perfect implementation they don't have any concern about my work but if I run into any issues and get delayed because I tried something that didn't work or I needed some time to analyze the codebase then my productivity is suspect.\n\nSo basically if I knew this codebase well enough that all tasks where obvious to me and easy to implement then I could probably produce work in the time they ask but, at 6 months, I still run into challenging situations that take additional time for me to resolve. \n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Is there a good representation of what kind of work is expected of the profession? And was my previous job where it was much less pressure the outlier? \n2. Is it the case that my skills are not what is expected of an intermediate developer whose been working with this code for the last 6 months?\n3. If I seek employment elsewhere am I likely to run into similar expectations?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.",

        "text": "Seven years into my career, my identical twin died unexpectedly. The grief knocked me out of full-time work for more than a year, and really atrophied in my knowledge and skills. But eventually got better enough to DIY a catch up and landed a senior job that was a huge upgrade for me in title and pay. However, the new role was a mixed bag of higher expectations than I was told I’d have and me dealing with new fragility around stress I hadn’t dealt with in a job before. I did okay, but I had holes in my knowledge that were hard to fill at the pace I needed to. The company was big on the Netflix policy of letting people go after a year if they are B+ or lower in performance, so I was cut along with a swath of people.\n\nI’ve had a rough six-month job search since. Did a lot of interviews. Got mid with a decent amount, but kept falling short of what people want for a senior dev, because I think there still is a real gap there for me in my knowledge set. I would apply for mid roles if I saw them or recruiters offered, but those just aren’t showing up for me here in Bay Area.\n\nAll that said, I’ve done a lot of stabs at upgrading my knowledge, but I’d really like to find something that holds my hand more through the process. I see options for junior engineer, but wonder if there’s something out there for engineers moving from mid to senior. Or programs that just take a senior and retool them for an emerging field of engineering.\nWelcome any thoughts ideas. I’m just realizing I should probably look beyond trying to do all this DIY myself and could really use the helping hand.",

        "text": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/22/meta-layoffs/\n\nFacebook parent company Meta is preparing for a fresh round of job cuts, deputizing human resources, lawyers, financial experts and top executives to draw up plans to deflate the company’s hierarchy, in a reorganization and downsizing effort that could affect thousands of workers.\n\nMeta plans to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the company’s interns, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on about internal matters. Other managers may end up overseeing a higher number of employees as their teams grow bigger. Some inside Meta expect employees whose jobs have been converted to eventually quit, trimming the company’s workforce by default.\nIn addition to targeting managers, the company is also considering more traditional cuts, including slashing some projects and jobs, the person said. These efforts, which are targeted at divisions across the company and around the world, may not happen on a single day, but will likely roll out across the company in the coming months.\n\nThe job eliminations arrive after Zuckerberg sought to reassure workers that he didn’t “anticipate more layoffs” after the company slashed 11,000 jobs — roughly 13 percent of its workforce — in November. At the time, Zuckerberg told remaining employees the company had made a substantial cut to “minimize the chance of having to do broad layoffs like this for the foreseeable future,” according to a recording of the companywide meeting reviewed by The Washington Post.\n\n“I obviously can’t sit here and promise you that nothing will happen in the future because it’s a very volatile environment,” he added. “But what I can say is that for where we are right now, that’s was I foresee.”\n\nBut earlier this month, Zuckerberg proclaimed 2023 the “year of efficiency,” promising investors he would trim middle management and speed up the company’s decision-making, hinting at the possibility of more cuts.\n\nMeta spokesman Dave Arnold declined to comment but directed The Washington Post to previous public comments from Zuckerberg in which he said the company needed to become more efficient.\n\n“We closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams,” Zuckerberg told investors earlier this month. “When we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end.”",

Employers will almost always hire someone who has deep understanding in a specific stack. As in, If you're a Node.js dev, you probably won't be hired for a .Net position. If you're a Java Spring dev, it's also highly unlikely they will hire you for a node.js position\n\nAnother point, is that as a fresh grad job seeker, I mostly get approached by mentors and coaches. Many of them do ask for a fee as well, which is weird to me (since most of us fresh grads are already broke af and drowned with debts)\n\nAlso every mentor I get in touch with, they always try to push me towards business and entrepreneurship mindset. I'm a Comp Sci grad, with a technical and mathematical background, and never had an interest or a mindset of an entrepreneur before (didn't even crossed my mind)\n\nI'm so introverted I chose programming as a career, bcz it suits my personality well and keeps me away from all the heavy socializing and presentation stuff (like lawyers, business men, a journalist or an actor, etc..)\n\nSorry for the long vent, my thoughts are all over the place.

I've been reading about people's experiences interviewing for frontend positions, and it seems like the interview process can be much tougher than for backend devs. In addition to leetcode hard and system design questions, frontend devs will also be asked to demonstrate their domain knowledge, build a mini-app or library function, or implement an asynchronous/promise logic in a very short time.\n\nIt feels like there's a lot more to prepare to be a frontend dev at a big tech, and job security might not be well compared to backend.

My plan was to finish my internship, take the subjects I'm missing, then apply for a CS degree. My concern is that I really hated doing operations and I'm scared that I won't enjoy being a developer in a job context either. I like programming, love problem-solving, and find tech very interesting. But what I'm doing today feels so pointless (like why tf do I have to repack executables just so they can execute silently through a shitty tool that take 20 minutes to sync?! Worst-case scenario just install the program files on a server and sync them to client machines...)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been worrying about this for a while tbh, stopped programming for fun a few months ago because I was so burnt out. I literally, just watch youtube when I come home from work at this point because I'm so tired. Do yall think these problems will persist if I pursue a CS degree? Will my tasks feel pointless and repetitive?",

Everyday I keep telling myself my life would've been so much better if I had majored in Computer Science at a lower ranked university rather than taking the bait for a joint major called \"Mathematics-Computer Science\" that's really mostly math. Honestly, all I want to do is work from home and not be stressed. I thought the major looking like a double major (even though it's really just one major) would catch some eyes, but now I'm having second thoughts.\n\nThis is the exact opposite of what I'd imagined I'd be doing, I'm killing myself by bending over to do math problems all the time. At the same time, I notice how much easier my cs courses are and it just makes me feel so regretful for picking status over passion. I feel like this math is hindering my dream of working from home in a low stress environment, since I feel like I have less time for internships and job prep due to all of these fucking math classes that I'm taking and that I'm probably going to forget once I graduate. \n\nI just keep thinking back to myself why I made the choice in the first place, and I think it alongside the double major idea it was literally just because I wanted to be at a \"prestigious\" school, whatever the fuck that means. When I apply for jobs I'm literally going to have a bunch of esoteric math theorems in my brain and at best about 1/2 the knowledge that a pure CS major would have. Like, it doesn't even matter for shit that my current school is \"better\" than the one I could've chose pure CS for, what matters is the knowledge of CS concepts for interview, which I'm going to have jack shit of when I graduate. Plus the fact that some of my general education requirements won't transfer if I transfer schools so I'll likely end up taking much more classes and delaying graduation even more.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me? Honestly my ultimate goal is to work from home in a low stress job. I just got spooked after realizing the lack of career opportunities in pure math. I still remember the story someone told about pure maths job opportunities. It goes like this: \n\n&gt; Once upon a time, there was a person who studied dragons and how to kill them for their entire life, and went on to a dragon slaying college. They met up with the greatest dragon slayers of all time, and graduated with honors from that college. Out in the real world, this person was struggling to find a job slaying dragons. There were no dragons around! so he asked his teacher to give them advice.\n\n&gt; The teacher said, \"teach others how to slay dragons\"\n\nThat's what I feel like I'm gonna be. A middle-aged teacher in the most socially accepted pyramid scheme teaching glorified toddlers and getting sick every month. I do NOT want to be that person.",
