[{"title":"Why do people not check the hours before coming in??","author":"gothbias","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11pnw89\/why_do_people_not_check_the_hours_before_coming_in\/","text":"I\u2019ve worked my job waiting tables for just a little under a year now and before now I had no clue how little people check the hours of restaurants before just coming right on in. \n\nIt kinda just seemed like common sense to check for me? But my mom was a server when I was growing up, so I just chalked it up to me knowing the etiquette or something but my boyfriend (who has never worked a food service job in his life and has no close relatives who worked in the industry either) has never left the house without checking the hours on the place he wants to go out to eat, even before I started working this job.\n\nJust this morning I had a gentleman who walked right inside the building, ignoring the closed sign in the window and the hours posted on the door. Maybe you could give someone the benefit of the doubt over that, but the entire front of our restaurant is glass so he could see me unrolling rugs and taking chairs down and still decided to walk inside. When I told him we weren\u2019t open for another thirty minutes he looked at me kinda surprised and went, \u201cReally? There\u2019s cars outside.\u201d And I wanted to scream because how exactly did he expect the cook and myself to get here? By plane? No shit there\u2019s cars in the parking lot!\n\nAnd this happens ALL the time. People speeding into the parking lot right at close and being upset that I can\u2019t serve them. I\u2019ve had a guy who got here 5 minutes before close, sat in his car for 10 minutes, and then came in and acted pissed and put out when I told him we were closed. I have locals who I KNOW knows our hours that\u2019ll race in a few minutes before close and say \u201cWe made it just in time!\u201d No, you didn\u2019t, you made it at the most inconvenient time for us. We don\u2019t get to leave when y\u2019all do, we leave after we clean up your mess, sweep, mop, restock things, trash clean the bathrooms, etc etc. on a day where I\u2019m the only server (which is often) I may leave almost 2 hours past closed because someone decided to come in a minute before we close.\n\nI almost feel guilty about being so bitter about it. We\u2019re a small, locally owned diner and I\u2019m thrilled we\u2019re this popular. I\u2019m proud to work here and I love working for my boss and truly believe he deserves all the money he\u2019s making. BUT DAMN! How hard is it to check the hours??\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve had to say this about a million times in the comments and I\u2019m a bit tired so I\u2019ll just say it here. I cannot lock the door from the inside, so comments like \u201cthe door needs to be locked\/ just lock the doors\/ xyz is why you should lock the door\u201d is entirely unhelpful. If you need more info than that just look at the comments please, I\u2019ve answered tons of questions.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678650547.0},{"title":"Man makes an ass of himself in front of entire restaurant","author":"Juice_Staine","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11pjtj0\/man_makes_an_ass_of_himself_in_front_of_entire\/","text":"This happened a while ago but scrolling through this sub I decided I should post this story.

I enjoy serving. Of course there\u2019s ups and downs, but all in all it\u2019s a fun, fast paced job that can pay very well. For the past 2 years I\u2019ve been working at a well known chain restaurant, as a server of course. Doing all the traditional things a server does from taking orders, running drinks, food, etc etc. \n\nOne day I come in to work and one of my coworkers asks me \u201cwhat do you think about this whole \u201csupport staff\u201d situation? I heard X has already put in his 2 weeks notice.\u201d I\u2019ve been out for only one day at this point so I\u2019m confused. I ask her to elaborate. Basically a new role would be introduced that would make \u201cservers\u201d simply order takers and the new \u201csupport staff\u201d would do all the heavy lifting from running drinks, food, cleaning tables, and doing side work. Tip out would go from 3% to 6% and the support staff would be paid slightly more than server minimum wage at $9(this later turned out to be a lie, they would be paid the same as servers which here is $7). None of this was explained by management by the way, we all just found out by asking each other what we\u2019ve heard. Nobody new was hired on to cover these roles and no training was had, this all was just going to happen within the week. We were told everyone was going to rotated between serving and supporting. \n\nWhen the schedule finally came out, the shifts were not distributed fairly. I suddenly went from being a full time server to a bus boy with more duties without warning. I was so livid I quit on the spot. I was happy to hear I wasn\u2019t the only one that quit.

My current restaurant is def on the shadier side when it comes to employment practices. From threatening to pull shifts if we don't get Google reviews, to an extremely hostile and incompetent expo who will scream, curse at you, and slam things for nothing at all.... They've also been getting fast and loose with the tip credit. \n\n\nI first raised the issue when they implemented a new chart for cleaning side work, in addition to normal sidework, that clearly runs afoul of 80\/20. The chart says to pick three things per shift to complete, and the tasks include cleaning every booth in the restaurant, moving every table and vacuuming, cleaning every outside table, etc.  They also started this when we were understaffed on bussers, so I think it was an effort to save money on labor from having to hire them. Servers were also told to pick up the slack in cleaning the bathrooms. \n\n\n\nAgain, wasn't making a huge deal about it, but hey this could be a liability if someone makes a ruckus about it. My manager had never heard of 80\/20, or any of the limitations on what work servers can and can't do for the tip credit. I showed my gm the law and he said to email it to him and he'll send it to corporate.\n\n\n\nFew weeks go by, nothing happens, ok whatever fuck me then. Wasn't really expecting it to go anywhere. However, the pot got a bit stirred when I got trained on bar and did a full week of training shifts where I couldn't earn tips, and I saw they claimed the tip credit for that entire week. Additionally, theyd scheduled me for an 8:00 am cleaning shift on my day off (we open at 11). Id asked the managers on 3 separate occasions if I would at least get min wage for that 8 am cleaning shift they kept saying yeah.... Low and behold, they never changed it and my paystub reflected the tip credit applied for all hours worked. At this point I draft up a written request for unpaid wages detailing every opening shift I've worked (openers come in an hour before open, which de facto violates the 30 min provision in FLSA), the training week, the deep cleaning shift, and a couple notable nights I had to hang out and do side work despite not having a table for hours.\n\n\n\nI ultimately cooled a bit though and didn't turn it in. Fast forward a few more weeks to yesterday. They said corporate finally answered the legal email and said nah as long as we get minimum wage for the week that's all that's required (which is just a flat out lie). So now I'm pissed that they're playing games and say fuck it, I update the request for wages for all opening shifts I've had since and turn it in.\n\n\n\nToday, the very next day, as soon as I come in they pull me in the office. They say they're writing me up for this list I made. I made a very detailed closing list on how to close for a new guy whose first night it was closing. I'd actually gone super detailed on how to time things and properly clean things (ie nobody ever cleans the tea urn nozzles and they get grimy and disgusting and have flies every morning, literally made a schematic of the nozzle and how to take it apart). Id also made some jokes, ie there's one girl I'm friends with but tease her because she's notorious for skipping out on sidework. Again, we're friends, I tease her and she laughs and takes it all in good faith, we literally got juice together today on break. I'd shown the manager the list when I made it over a week ago and she kept saying she loved it, she needs to type that up I better save it for her, and it's so true. Today, same manager says she's writing me up because the jokes in the list are harassment. I said that's bullshit, I wasn't born yesterday. I was hoping the wage thing could be resolved easily, all I ever wanted was to be acknowledged. But now they're obv going the retaliation route and things are going to get messy. They just swore nah it's harassment. I asked the girl who was 'harassed' about it and if she'd heard anything about it, she said no but found the jokes hilarious.\n\n\n\nAnddddd as I was typing this at a bar after work, a dude the manager is trying to bang was here too. I've always been cool with him. Gave him a brief summary of what happened, and he said he's not supposed to tell me this but yeah they're trying to get rid of me, manager already asked him if he knows any bartenders because I'm on the way out....\n\nI submitted a complaint to the department of labor, but on Monday I plan to call and update the complaint ASAP with the obvious retaliation efforts. If they don't pay the wages within the 15 days I also plan to pursue arbitration for the wages + liquidated damages+ any damages that result from retaliation","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678516866.0},{"title":"high customers \"dine\" n' dash","author":"jjulieea","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11p0agj\/high_customers_dine_n_dash\/","text":"pointless story, just recalling a moment. around a year ago, i worked as a server at a very well-known pancake house. i worked the morning shift from 6am-3pm, so it was still pretty dead when i would clock in. \n\ni usually deal with people who reek of dope or sometimes even alcohol, but i don't refuse service unless they're impossible to deal with since i don't really care as long as i get my tip. \n\none early morning, as soon as i clock in, a (i'm assuming) teenage couple walks in and bring along the very strong smell of weed. they immediately ask if we accept apple pay (which should've been a red flag imo), and after saying we do i let them sit themselves. they're super out of it, but are still able to order their meals. im already going back and forth because they say the soda's not carbonates enough or the juice is watery (i tasted them, they were fine) and as i'm walking away to out in their order i see them hit a pen. i don't say anything because i don't want any trouble, no one's around and i'm a mega people pleaser. \n\nwhile waiting for their food, the girl gets up to go to the bathroom and really takes a while, so long that i take their food out while she's still in there. guy says she'll be back but asks for a bunch of small items (flavored syrup, ketchup, hot sauce) and doesn't touch his food even after dropping everything off. finally, the girl walks out and they're just chatting. i check up on them and see that out of their entire (pretty large) meal, they've only eaten one half slice of french toast and not even 1\/4 of the eggs. \n\ni go to chill up front so i can keep an eye on people coming in (no one is) and see they're walking up front. i'm at the register and ask if they're ready to cash out and if everything's ok. they avert their eyes and quickly walk out. i'm speechless, i've never had this happen and i didn't want to chase them if they were running away. my coworker asks if they just ran out on me and goes after them yelling at them. they were running around in the empty parking lot next door?? giggling and dancing around, i've never been so confused. \n\ni don't really try to do anything, it's not my problem and i was afraid they might do something if they're not in their right mind so i accept my fate and go to clean up their table. tell me why i'm about to squeeze through the booth to grab their (very full) plates and i see fucking blood on the seats. on BOTH seats, smeared enough to not touch any specific part. i have to wait for my manager to come in to clean it up because fuck that, i am not touching that. my poor manager comes in and has to null their $40 tab and clean up their disgusting mess.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678581431.0},{"title":"Shift Meals\/Recommendations Needed","author":"Diligent_Field","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11ovxaq\/shift_mealsrecommendations_needed\/","text":"Hey servers!\nI\u2019ve been at my first serving job for about 7 months now and throughout those months I\u2019ve lost some weight and muscle tone due to running around all day and having a hard time wanting to formally exercise when I get home AND not eating while on my shift.

I\u2019ve been a manager in a few places and am well versed on the laws, however I always worked in states that didn\u2019t have the alternative minimum wage. I\u2019ve recently relocated to a state that does have the alternative minimum wage. \n\nI work in a large restaurant that has three more restaurants in another state. \n\nIn our restaurant we don\u2019t directly tip out support staff. The restaurant adds a line to our turn in and subtracts it from cash due. They put this money into a pool with the other restaurants and use it to pay support a higher wage. Their wage never varies. So when we make a crap ton of money in the busy season, they don\u2019t earn more. I have heard that occasionally management will give a \u201cbonus\u201d to some support staff, but not all. \n\nThere is no where in the computer to report allocated tips. When we clock out, if credit card tips and tip discount are higher than what we are declaring, the system won\u2019t let us clock out. We have to find a manager and have them do it for us. The manager isn\u2019t always easy to find. As a result, many servers just over declare their tips. \n\nClearly I know that all of this is illegal. There are a number of staff discussing meeting with an attorney, but they are afraid because we work for a place that aggressively retaliates. It\u2019s also probably the best tip money in the state, so people don\u2019t want to lose their jobs and also be blacklisted from other restaurants in the area. \n\nOur support is terrible. Literally almost zero help. It doesn\u2019t help that the support staff doesn\u2019t even know we pay their wage, due to their wage not ever changing. \n\nIn addition, this restaurant has an hour scheduled to open and NEVER pays more than $2.13 an hour for this, which violates FLSA law. \n\nHas anyone gone the legal route in a situation like this? How exposed are the complainants as far as the risk of their names getting out and suffering retaliation? \n\nI want to just approach management with all of this, but I have asked enough questions from long term employees to know that they are fully aware that this is all illegal.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678545811.0},{"title":"I'm sick of being screamed at by entitled people that don't get their way.","author":"Kathisobelallyss","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11npm31\/im_sick_of_being_screamed_at_by_entitled_people\/","text":"So my boss has us not seat anyone past a quarter to close.

I could manage circles around these dumb ass dudes. The kind of managers who had no idea what they were doing but still thought they were better than everyone else. Especially any woman who worked there.\n\nAbout 5 months in, already two feet out the door, I'm working on a busy night. This place made the servers do A LOT. Make our own salads, tableside guac, and make our own desserts. (side note: I will never work at a place like that again.) I go to grab something out of the freezer, and when I open the door, I notice that there is no cold air rushing out. I immediately go to the manager on duty (the dumbest one we had) and informed him that I thought the freezer was broken. He kind of waved me off, like it wasn't a big deal and that he would look into it later.\n\nI finished my shift and went home with a suspicious feeling that he wasn't going to do shit about that freezer. Like I said, I was already fed up with the place, so I typed up a two week resignation and decided that the first thing I would do on my next shift was check to see if they had done anything about it. The next night I went in, and sure enough, it was still broken.\n\nThey had been serving guests out of a broken freezer for over 24 hours. There was a bag of thawed shrimp at the bottom that I saw a cook grab a handful of as I was checking the temperature.\n\nI walked right up to the manager on duty (the SAME dumbass dude) and told him that I would not work on the floor until the freezer had been fixed, and handed him my two weeks. Later that night I put a call into the GM saying the same thing, and told him I would be calling OSHA. He profusely apologized and said he would call a technician right away.\n\nMy next scheduled shift I got a call from dumbass wondering where I was, even though I had told him I wouldn't work on the floor until I knew it was fixed. He told me I was considered a no call no show and that I was terminated. Dumb. Ass.\n\nEpilogue: got a call from the GM a day or two later, thanking me for bringing the issue to his attention. Turns out, someone had ACCIDENTALLY UNPLUGGED THE FREEZER. It wasn't even broken. Dumbass just didn't even bother to go check. The GM kind of begged me to come back because I clearly had some sense in me, but I was so over it that I absolutely declined.\n\nI want to hear your stories!

I was bartending and the bar is up 2 stairs in its own section, so I can't really see what's going on down on the floor. I get a play by play from one of the servers. A table came in, one guy and two girls. Everyone said they were here the night before, and they were making people uncomfortable. They were filming and feeding each other dessert, bouncing up and down and just being provocative in the middle of the restaurant, presumably for only fans. I don't have a problem with people making money this way, but it's pretty rude to do it in front of people that just want to go out for a meal with their family.  So, they came back last night and ordered the big dessert platter, round 2. We knew exactly where this was going and the server was like, hell no, not again. Our manager went to tell them that they couldn't film their content in the restaurant, servers don't consent to being filmed and they are making people uncomfortable. Dude loses his shit before she can even get the words out of her mouth. Hes calling her a bitch and a Karen and saying that we are just jealous of them.

He's 36. The girls are barely 18 and 19. He has tons of content about \"barely legal\" and if I had to guess he doesn't really care too much about age. The girls were dressed in kind of childlike fetish wear. Plastic barrettes and pigtails. Which isn't really an issue but I think it paints a picture.

I was working perfectly, it wasn't too slammed so I had time with my tables, and I didn't miss a beat. Everyone was tipping over 20% and I was having an awesome time. \n\nAnd then in walks a part of 10. No biggie, right? We have 2 tables next to each other that they can share, and i would serve one table, my section buddy would take the other. Except when I get over there, the first thing I notice is that they are mostly kids under the age of 10, except for 2 adults. At the time, i had a 6 top and a 4 top. My 4 top that was already there has gotten their food and was doing fine, and the 6 had just gotten refills and their food should be out anytime now. So I decide to go greet my new table. I was splitting the 10 with another server. He was taking 4 of them and I was taking 6. So when I get over there, before I can introduce myself, the mom at my table snaps at me \"I wanna get an appetizer\" telling me she wants a combo app. OK, so I can immediately tell that youre \"that\" table. In the combo, you get 3 choices and of course she didn't tell me what she wanted in it so I had to ask. No big deal, some first timers at the place don't know how the menu works. Except for the fact that she changed her mind about what she wanted halfway through, making me scratch out what I had written. And then when I get their drink orders, each kid is just shouting at me the drink they want, instead of going in order like I always make my tables do. I go around the tables in seat order because that helps me get drinks and food rang in correctly, thus resulting in an easier time for me and a better experience for the guest. Its not a big deal if i go out of order, bu5 when there's 6 kids screaming drinks at me, i get overwhelmed. And this mom isn't doing anything to calm her kids down. She just let's them keep yelling and screaming and being overall annoying. \n\nWhen I came by to take their order after I got their app rang in and dropped off the drinks, it took me literally like 10 minutes to take their order because each person changed their mind al least once and wanted very weird modifications to their food, so i had to make a bunch of special notes. During this time, they kept jumping around in terms of who is ordering, rather than letting me go around the table by seat number. The table, playing musical chairs and switching tables, telling me items that they want to order for the other table, despite having been told that the other half of the table has a different server and a different bill. Random kids from the other table changing their minds on what table they want to sit at so now I have to take more orders and my notepad now just looks like a mess of scribbles.\n\nDuring all this chaos, my other 6 top from before had gotten their food and was doing OK. (Thank God they were so chill) So I use the pos to put in the order for Nightmare 6 top. During this time, a couple of the kids are running around behind me at the table. They keep bumping into other guests and just being crazy. And then: surprise! I hear the dreaded sound of liquid and ice spilling behind me. I turn around and sure enough the kids have knocked a drink over. Dr. Pepper is now cascading onto the floor. So while I'm pressing buttons, they start yelling for me across the dining room, telling me they need a new drink. (Like duh, you can't drink Dr. Pepper off the floor, I know you'll need a new one)\n\nLong story short, they basically ran me around all night and they turned a really chill, fun day into a stress-filled, agonizing, mentally exhausting experience. In the end, they left me 5 dollars on a bill of $125. Totally not worth it for all the trouble. \n\nMoral of the story, if you ever have a server that wants to do things or take orders in a certain way, it's probably in your own interest to just let them lead the table. Also, don't take 10 minutes to order. If you need time, that's OK remember that you are not the servers only table and that the longer you take, the less time the server can check on their other tables. By taking so long and being so indecisive, you are worsening the experience of other diners. And if you have kids, please control them. Servers are not babysitters.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678389109.0},{"title":"\u201cWelcome back\u201d or not\u2026","author":"_DesertRose7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11n7a97\/welcome_back_or_not\/","text":"I was just reminded of a funny (to me now) short story from once upon my young and naive days of serving.

This was a first for me so I didn\u2019t notice, printed my checkout and I realized that I\u2019m short $50. The manager that put it in had already left for the day and the closing manager said I have to get with the GM. I got with the GM for MONTHS on end. In January he told me to stop asking him and that he has to figure it out and it would be at least a month until I can get it. Then on February 16 at the start of my shift, he came up to me and said he talked to the manager that took my tip and that I should expect it in the next week. It is now March 7th and I haven\u2019t received a penny of that $50. \n\nI just got hired for a new job and I am planning on quitting.

We opened at 9 and she barely helped out when we had our opening rush of drink, instead she either walked off to a different floor to talk with the other caddie or hiding in the back of the beverage station to talk with Talker, I should also mention that I'm sick with the cold luckily if I stayed calm and not talk too much I don't end up having a coughing fit that leads into an asthma attack, luckily I was wearing a mask and did manage to remain calm.\n\nI was running up and down the stairs getting things to make drinks as well as kids cups and coffee cups to restock things, as soon as 11am hit Wonder says to me \"I'm going to go on my break,\" before walking away and not waiting to hear my response, yeah she disappeared for more than 15 minutes which is the amount of time we're supposed to take for our lunch break. When she finally came back, it was nearly noon or so, the carts were very full and Tanya comes into the beverage station asking \"the carts are getting full, Dragon_Crystal or Wonder who wants to change it?\"\n\nWonder basically just ignored her, so I immediately say \"I'll do it,\" I said it to get away from Wonder and let her hand the drinks BY HERSELF for a while. Well as I'm getting the clean cart prepared to change out the full one, Talker comes up and asks \"so which cart are you changing first?\" I tell her I'm changing the second cart one near her bays and she tells me \"thanks cause my cart is overfilling,\" which was true cause she had a event at her bays and so I replace the full one with the clean one, while condensing another cart by grabbing the dirty dishes and taking out the trash from it.\n\nBy the time I finish collecting all the items, the already full cart was super full and I had to use all my strength to push the cart to the elevator to bring to the kitchen on the bottom floor, I was starting to have difficulty breathing through my mask, but as soon as I got outside I did pull my mask down enough to breathe some fresh air and than pulled it back up before going back to work. Don't worry I was by myself and there wasn't anyone else around.\n\nI went back upstairs and went back to cleaning the full carts, than Talker walks up to me and says in a very demanding tone \"hey Dragon_Crystal could you hurry up cause Wonder is falling behind on drinks?\" I had to resist the urge to snap at her cause I was still sick and already working as quickly as I could, without having a coughing fit or an attack, but I just kept calm didn't snap at her and just kept working.\n\nWell when I finished collecting all the dirty dishes and got to the elevator, I turn and see both Talker and Wonder sitting in the back of the beverage station chatting and looking at Tik Tok, they both saw me and just glared at me like I was slacking off by using the carts as an excuse to run drinks.\n\nWell I just ignored their glares and pushed the cart into the elevator, after a finished doing carts and went back to running drinks, again Wonder immediately disappeared and left me to handle everything by myself. I ended up skipping my break cause she would repeatedly disappear while there was a lot of events happening, it wasn't until Tanya again asked for someone to change the carts that were again full, I immediately agreed to change them and it was around 2:30pm so if I was able to spend the rest of my shift handling the carts I wouldn't have to deal with Wonder.\n\nNope it didn't work cause around 3pm Wonder decided that she would take the cart from me and take an entire 30 minutes or more to finish that one cart, around 3:40 or so I asked Wonder \"Where did you put the clean cart?\"\n\nShe didn't respond and just walked away so I spend 5 minutes searching for the cart until I eventually found it than when 4pm hit she immediately grabbed her stuff and left without a word, while I was cleaning another set of carts. Due to this Flanders, its not his real name, but the preferred nickname he'd rather be called while at work, didn't know where Wonder or I was and started calling where we were over the radio.\n\nFlanders: Um does anyone have eyes on Dragon_Crystal or Wonder?\n\nI had actually snuck right by him, but since I was short and slipped right by his blind zone he didn't see me, so when I heard him asking where I was me, I immediately said \"I'm right here.\" Followed by a nicer coworker pointing in my direction and telling him either of us knew where Wonder had disappeared to, so they had to go and pull HC from his floor to cover for me until I could get back.\n\nI nearly had a mental breakdown from Wonder literally ignoring me and making me handle almost everything, not to mention the one Wonder kept disappearing to talk with hadn't been stacking their cups and when I took a picture to post on our department work chat (it was created by our supervisor not me), her friend claimed that she was too busy and couldn't stack them.\n\nWhich I understand but they weren't busy at the moment cause I had just walked by their floor to go to the bathroom and they weren't anywhere near \"crazy busy,\" Wonder and her were actually chilling in the breakroom, as soon as Wonder saw me she immediately bolts from the room before I can say a word. Cause she knew I wasn't going to chase after her, instead I reported her for leaving early and she hadn't told anyone that she was planning on leaving an hour early, but since she was already out of the building (probably hopped into her car and took off) Flanders and the other managers couldn't contact her.\n\nI assumed she had just ignored their calls or turned off her phone or something, but since they couldn't contact her, I had to finish the carts and handle the floor by myself with occasional help from HC until the end of my shift. As soon as night shift arrived I gave them the rundown of what they might need to check and what not, before heading out and I was mentally and physically drained. Yes I immediately took a nap as soon as I got home.\n\nTl;dr Entitled coworker slacks off almost the entire shift, makes me handle everything and demands I \"hurry up,\" while I was sick and nearly had a meltdown","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1678265738.0},{"title":"$1 tip from former regular","author":"melatoninbaby","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11ktxyc\/1_tip_from_former_regular\/","text":"i used to have this woman and her family come in. she would always get the snow crab legs and some other seafood stuff. she was a little particular and very polite but her husband always tipped well so i didn't mind. well one night she decides to order king crab legs. if you know anything about seafood, you would know that snow crab legs are pretty expensive on their own and at my restaurant king crab legs are about $65 per pound (which is a pretty good price for that type of crab), however they are listed as MP on the menu. this lady is pretty much a seafood pro so i assumed (silly me) that she would know what she was getting into. she orders one or two pounds of king crab legs but i don't really remember. anyway she completely demolishes those crab legs so i drop off the bill.\n\n i watch from a distance while her and the husband open the bill assuming everything would be fine but they were obviously confused about the bill. i go over to check if everything was alright but they were very upset at me. i can tell that they were thinking that i was trying to scam them but i would never do anything like that. it was also offensive that they would think that i would purposely deceive them when we were already pretty familiar with one another. they were being pretty nasty and rude to me too, which was weird because they used to be so polite up until that moment. it felt pretty personal. i grab my manager who i've known for awhile and have a good rep with and i let her handle it. she gives them some sort of discount and they leave. i don't remember if they left a tip that time or not. \n\ni've seen them a few times in the restaurant but it was never my turn to serve them which i was grateful for because i was honestly hurt by the whole thing. but it was so weird each time they came in after that because they always insisted on sitting in my section at the exact same booth. my section is one of the smallest sections in the restaurant so they were taking up real estate. i don't know if it was intentional or not but i ignored it. \n\nits been a few months after that incident so i felt like enough time had passed for us to be cool again. haha... apparently not. they came in right when it started to be busy. the table that they normally sit at was dirty and they were standing around in my section waiting for it to be cleaned (there were other open tables in my section btw). i already had my hands full with other tables, but i wanted to please them and send a positive signal, so i pushed some other stuff back on my metal queue and promptly cleaned their preferred table for them. after that everything seems to be going fine but like i said we were busy so food was taking a bit longer than normal. i didn't pick up any signals of irritation or any kind of upsettedness but i did go over once to assure them that the food was coming. i was keeping a close eye on the kitchen and i was able to deliver their meal right after it was plated. everything was exactly as ordered. \n\nthe whole time i'm kissing up to them and lowkey prioritizing them over my other tables because i want to make up for last time. eventually they finish so i drop off the check. husband pays cash and tells me that \"its all you\". i'm over here like great job me! mission success.

I was super confused and asked him to explain again, as the \u201cgap\u201d was less than 1\/5th of and inch, but he seriously meant that i was trying to rip him off because of this. The glass was literally overflowing when i poured it, so the foam only \u201cshrunk\u201d a tiny bit on the way to the table.\n\nAnyways, I just did as he said and went back and poured it over the brim again so i knew it was full enough for him (he was watching me with a huge smirk).

We tip them out 1% of our sales. When we are cut from the floor, but still have tables, the bussers stop bussing our sections, leaving us as servers to bus off our last round of tables. The bussers still take the 1% tip share from our last round even though they do absolutely nothing for those table, they don't bus them or clean them in any way. Tonight my last round of tables totaled $350 in sales. I had to bus off all those tables but still had to pay out the $3.50 (1% of sales) to the bussers. I know $3.50 isn't a lot of money but the average worker works 250 days a year, so 3.5 x 250 = 875. That's a lot of money I'm losing out on over the course of a year. Ive asked my managers about it and they blew my off saying that's how they have always done it. My question is, is this legal? The bussers do absolutely nothing as far as the last round of tables is concerned, is it legal for my employer to force me to tip them out on tables they don't bus? If this type of question is not allowed in this forum please delete, I just wasn't sure where to post this question.","upvote_ratio":0.58,"created_utc":1677991647.0},{"title":"When servers get annoyed\/mad","author":"zjheyyy88","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11icjh0\/when_servers_get_annoyedmad\/","text":"Okay I\u2019m a host and I always want the servers to do well.

(or maybe its the lack of care HR had).\n\nSo I worked for a large culinary firm. it had A catering operation and a restaurant with one of the most spectacular Venue's with a beach side view. Theres an admin office staff whom handles the day to day stuff. and then you have the culinary staffs. we have your chef, Her personal staff of handpicked 5 whom made up her Pseudo-Sou chef level chefs. I know odd format but this worked better than having a central guy. each Pseudo-Sou had a micro team of 2 to 3. The chef herself Enjoyed picking her staff for the back of the house team. Front house was selected by you guessed it By the admin team.\n\nSo the admin team brought in a New HR person (not the center of our story). This new HR dude realized that there's no centralized Sou-chef. Keep in mind the hand picked Team of Psuedo-Sou chefs have their own pecking order so if the chef is out they have their own Hierarchy. So without consulting our Chef, HR dude decides to try to hire his own to show hes up to the task. He brings in our issue, wannabe-chef (WC), to be our Sou chef.\n\nThe chef is not happy with the arrangement. but still shakes hands with smile. HR dude goes on how great this Sou-chef is. After extensive interviews, Grilling this guy for a bit, he found our next big star. The chef with a huge sigh says she'll try him out. So WC walks in with a superiority complex on his shoulders. that \"ive got the title\" for a reason. he sets up his little desk in the back with his awards, certifications and various Culinary Degrees. If you looked inside it was impressive, if you looked close, they seemed like poor photo copies. His ego is also like hes some kind of Superstar. \n\nOn his first day Hes called over to the main line and given the dreaded Chefs test. simply put we give any new cook before hired a set of drills that are part of a few recipes. think of it as Prepping some of our easy dishes. easy cant fail tasks.\n\nFirst is the knife test. Im at the station watching with fascination. Ive never seen a \"super star chef\" and Im on the autism spectrum so i figure I can learn something. Wannabe-chef Grabs his knife, sharpens it.... the wrong way.... Starts chopping in a rough way. in horror Im watching as wannabe chef ruins the ingredients. we watching try to correct his mistake. hes only making it worse. fails the test. we gave him some lee-way since some guys are better cooks than choppers.\n\nHes given the flip test next. Hes handed a piece of toast that's put in a pan. (something we do to train cooks to flip omelets) yeah. Wanna-be chef couldn't maintain diddly in the pan. we tried liquid to see if it could be just a liquid vs a solid. Total mess on the floor.\n\nok.... The chef decides to go all for nothing with this joker. He hand the guy a ticket and tells him to put it out in the allotted time. meanwhile Im told to make a backup since our chef had no confidence in the guy. Im the slowest cook ever, but iM a fast prep.\n\nyeah I.... finished faster than him. with time to spare. He stressed out.\n\nThe wheels in our chefs mind goes round..... she suddenly says to him \"you pass, But I wanna test you further\" We all are flabbergasted. Shes looking snide. She requests her line cook team I report to her immediately.\n\n\"I know hes a dud but listen. im gonna put him on the main line\" she says\n\n\"Hes gonna conk the system up, were gonna get over run and milled in minutes\" we complain\n\n\"exactly\" replies the chef\n\nMinutes later.... we get overrun and milled, tickets hitting the floor, why cause Wannabe chef wants to take charge of the line.\n\nHe couldn't lead ants to a picnic\n\nWe are conked up, orders messed up and hes repeatedly either burning, breaking, or destroying orders.\n\nIn walks the Admin staff wondering why things have gone from bad to worse.\n\nOur chef grabs HR dude. pulls him apart from the others. and announces this is the guy who hired our New super star sou chef.\n\nAfter the super star chef was demoted to a prep-cook and then again to dishwasher. he got overwhelmed in both spots and.... quit for personal reasons (rolls eyes)\n\nWe did eventually find out a bit more about him.\n\nHis diplomas, his certs, his resume was one big hoax. all Prints from the net.

We only have two sizes of pizza, a 12\u201d and our 7\u201d kids pizzas. That is, until this past September when we started offering a lunch special that runs weekdays from 11am-2pm. With the special you get a 7\u201d version of any of our craft pizzas, a side of three wings, and a fountain drink starting at $10.\n\nOur place is also across from a court house and when they have trials, our place gets slammed with jurors and court house workers. Because of the special being a beloved item amongst our court regulars and jurors who only have an hour for lunch, our kitchen gets slammed with these small orders and often get really behind during our rush, so for the past couple of months, our managers have told us servers not to offer the lunch special depending on the day.\n\nThe mangers say it\u2019s mostly because of it putting the kitchen behind and to also keep our server tips up since it allows us like $6 tips versus a $12 with every table, but the feeling of whether or not a manager feels like having our store deal with all the specials is becoming too often and inconsistent. It\u2019s a *weekday* special, and today I had three tables get visibly upset and outwardly express they may not stay because they didn\u2019t want to eat anything else but the special and didn\u2019t want to order a whole pizza. One of those three tables did actually leave, which they were not rude about at all and I completely understood their reason.\n\nI\u2019m just venting. I love where I work because of their extreme flexibility and I know I do a really good job, but at this point I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m not making as much money as I could versus if people ordered our full sized pizzas because now people are essentially threatening their loyalty to us because we keep choosing when not to offer the special when customers expect it to be offered every weekday. They\u2019re not taking it out at me personally, but I\u2019m getting tired of seeing people disappointed, and I know if I were a customer I\u2019d be upset too.\n\nI\u2019ve expressed to my GM over the last few weeks that people, especially our regulars, are starting to get upset but she says she doesn\u2019t really care because she\u2019s doing it for the good of the kitchen and getting servers more money \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677727132.0},{"title":"I don\u2019t get tipping a % of bill","author":"ApprehensiveKiwi6957","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11g5lqw\/i_dont_get_tipping_a_of_bill\/","text":"Let me start by saying I worked in food service for little over 2 years and I never understood the tipping 20% idea.

I am the top seller there I account for most tips I am very personable with guests, I have so many regulars, I rarely make mistakes, but still she gives me only 3 shifts a week and I have to pick up shifts to make 5, where as the the ones who kiss ass get 5 and don\u2019t make even half the sales or tips I makes. I could have top sales for the week and she will still nitpick me and give me shit about a stain on my uniform but barely praise me for holding it down when I\u2019m pulling everything. I asked her why I don\u2019t get enough shifts and she said it\u2019s all performance based. This just doesn\u2019t add up.

This doesn't happen super often and it's only the second private event I've worked, the first time being an absolute fucking disaster during which every member of staff cried at least once. Needless to say, we were hoping this time went a lot smoother.\n\nWe were just working on the info the organizers gave us, which we were led to believe had been communicated to the guests as well. Basically, if guests had a pink lanyard, they were paying for drinks as they went; grey lanyard meant they had a pre-paid package and got free refills on beers, wines and soft drinks. What's important to note is that they did NOT get spirits included.\n\nThe event actually goes super smooth, we get their two courses out really quick, drinks are flying out of the bar at rapid pace. We actually all smashed it, to be completely honest.\n\nThe organizers told us to stop serving drinks at about 1:15pm, get their checks paid off and get everyone ready to depart on their coaches to the game. This is where things started getting... interesting.\n\nThree of my five tables asked to talk to a manager when I told them the bar was closed lol. Exactly why they thought she'd be able to do anything when we were working on what their organizers told us I don't know.\n\nThen, one of my tables with grey lanyards got confused when I brought over the bill. One guy asked \"what the fuck is that?\" to which I told him it was the bill and the refills of beer they'd had were included in their package so it was just the several double vodkas they had to pay for. He asked \"since when?\" and I obviously told him that was the plan from the start because, well, it was.\n\nHe... Was not pleased to say the least. Started yelling at me about how he'd ordered the premium package, wasn't supposed to have to pay, this was a fucking disgrace, get me your manager right now, etc etc. After a few minutes of this and me gently explaining we were working on the information provided by their organizers, he demanded I go get someone who was in charge. I was already sick of him and knew my manager wouldn't be able to do anything so I just went straight to the top, got the main organizer and asked him what was going on. He went to speak to them, then spoke to my manager and I have no idea what happened or what was said, but somehow the guy didn't end up having to pay for the spirits and they were put on the organizers' tab instead.\n\nI do understand the guy's perspective, if he thought he was getting everything included and then that didn't happen, I get why he's pissed off. But bro I am not the person to be yelling at. And in my opinion it's a lack of organization and clarity on the organizers' part, not ours.\n\nOther than that everything went well, I actually got some decent tips, and we were told we'd all done really well. Even got a bottle of prosecco because I'd managed to sell the most of a specific brand of beer we were pushing. Still, that one guy did put a bit of a dampener on things.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677507204.0},{"title":"Giving Shifts to Others","author":"HaileyQuinnzel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11dr7tt\/giving_shifts_to_others\/","text":"Another rant.

I work mostly with very competent servers in a pool so we are able to make aggressive cuts and walk with a lot of cash. \n\nLast night I had mostly very nice people, lots of compliments on my service, good banter etc. This was until I had a party sit of four people around my age (late 20s), during the one moment i would say i was kind of weeded as we had gone down to two servers and our support staff was less than great. The women sat first with their boyfriends sitting about 10-15 minutes afterward. I of course greeted the women first and the men shortly after they sat. One guy in particular was demanding from the moment he sat, essentially telling me how to do my job rather than me being able to handle the flow of their table to accommodate the rest of my section\/the restaurant. Example is within 5 minutes of their drinks hitting the table they asked a busser to get me so that they could order. Not my fave when people do that but I went over right away. They did wait a bit on drinks as the bar was busy, but other than that they had a fine experience from my perspective. Food was prompt and correct. I recommended wine and got them drink refills. Cleared and reset between courses, etc. Throughout the whole meal the one guy was speaking to me like i was an idiot. I am typically super patient with tables (a lot of retired folks in our area so it\u2019s necessary) but i will admit I think i let my frustration with them show a bit but was not outwardly rude (i would legit never be rude to a table) just a bit more curt than i usually am. \n\nAfter I ran their payment at the end the guy (with some help from his friends) proceeded to tell me that I had delivered the worst service they had ever had at our restaurant, they come all the time (never seen them in my life), they are former industry etc. I calmly thanked them for their feedback, apologized for their experience, and immediately went to my manager to have her speak to them.

I\u2019ve never had a complaint about my service in my entire career, much less to my face in what felt like a personal attack. If it was ever going to happen I expected it from grumpy old folks, not people my age. I know my job is secure and I should just get over it, but this is really fucking with me. Any advice about how to reframe this in my head so that it doesn\u2019t stick with me and ruin my days off?","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677421771.0},{"title":"I\u2019ve worked a manufacturing job for 3 years and I\u2019m so tired of it.

One such restaurant was attached to an \"Upper upscale\" (actual classification) hotel\/spa. As part of my duties as a food runner I would also deliver room service orders. This was not a big part of my job as room service was only regular menu items and a mandatory $5 room service charge and automatic 20% gratuity to discourage small orders. So naturally there were no casual items, there were no tuna sandwiches only *seared U10 diver scallops on a squid ink polenta* and for the huge percentage of guests getting off a plane from a transatlantic flight, french cooking is a little hard on the stomach.\n\nEnough preamble, it was a normal Saturday night after the dinner rush. There are only a few tables left, but food is mostly done and the kitchen crew is breaking down for the night.  A man in a suit sticks his head into the kitchen.  \n\"Is it too late for an order of fries?\"  \n\"For you?\"  \n\"Room service.\"  \n\"Just fries\u203d It's gonna be like twenty bucks for just fries.\"  \n\"Just fries.\"  \n\nI ask the kitchen and they give the green light. Five minutes later I'm in the elevator with a slightly larger plate of fries from a benevolent kitchen.  I get to the room and knock.  A moment later, a woman in a loose robe swings the door open and I know immediately that she's working.  This was not a common occurrence at the hotel and it was much more difficult to tell with the tax brackets of our average guests, but it happened enough that we got a pretty good eye for it.  But this young lady is done for the night, the mask is off.  This is a performer at the end of a shift; she's tired and she just wants some fries.  It looks like it's been a long night, further evidenced by the lack of anyone else visible from the door.  I hand her the check to sign everything to the room. She scribbles something and hands it back to me open. I see a further $100 tip on top of the automatic 20% of $6.99.  I look up at her and before I have a chance to think of a question she answers it:\n\n\"because, fuck 'em.\"\n\nSo I don't know who you are even though I'm sure I asked front desk what your name was and promptly forgot, and I don't know what odious deeds you have done or what sins you have committed, but I'm thankful that you were bad enough to deserve a $100 penalty in the form of one service worker helping out another.\n\nTl:dr; Trickle down morality\n\nEdit: The bad person is whoever was renting the room and paying for the tip, not the awesome lady who hooked me up","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677399729.0},{"title":"I think a table accidentally tipped me 70%","author":"jswaggy14","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11byt2q\/i_think_a_table_accidentally_tipped_me_70\/","text":"So, I work at a pretty expensive restaurant for my area.

I ask if they want to see the desert menu and they decline, so I drop the check. I make my rounds and as I look over to see if they\u2019re ready for me to pick up the check I see them fiddling with cash. I don\u2019t go over there right away and wait for them to count it out and close the check presenter.

In pretty much every place I've worked at, management acts like they care about how good the service is, but then will create conditions not conducive to it for the sake of increasing sales. And what I mean by that is they will seat people as fast as they physically can because they think if you seat faster, that means they get their stuff faster, and they leave faster so another table can sit down sooner.\n\nBut what they don't account for is what happens when they're throwing people at everyone as fast as they can. Because what happens is the bar gets backed up and drinks take longer to be made, servers are busier so drinks take longer to be run. And if not every interaction with customers is brief, then that just delays things even more. If I get triple-sat and one table asks me questions for like 10 minutes, everything is more likely to be fucked unless the other tables are especially patient.\n\nI wouldn't care as much about them throwing tables at me as fast as they can if they at least were realistic about what is possible to do for them. But they're not. Every preshift meeting I'm at at work is a list of extra things to do and say for tables, which added up are too much time when we're being triple, quadruple, or quintuple sat. It feels useless because all of the servers in the room know they're full of shit. They live in this mythical world where no matter how fast things go or how many people are sat at once, everything can be done, and that's simply not true. But they don't know that because they don't actually serve, but they think they're more informed anyway even though they're not.\n\nIt also seems like management never wants to accept responsibility for creating the conditions in which more stuff goes wrong and more people are unsatisfied. I get the restaurant has to make money, but at a certain point if they're willing to make good service less possible or impossible for the sake of increasing sales, they have to acknowledge and live with the consequences of it. And they do halfway sometimes, like if a night was especially crazy, they'll attribute stuff going wrong to how busy it was, but they never acknowledge that it's preventable if they space things out, but that's anathema because it's not as good for sales.\n\nAt the end of the day, sales matter more. If they had to pick between less money for the restaurant and everyone gets good service, and more money for the restaurant but not everyone gets good service, they choose the latter. But then somehow everything that goes wrong is the servers' fault or it's attributed to us being \"busy.\" Are they aware they're making this choice? Are they aware of the consequences of not spacing things out?\n\nOn the bright side, the managers at the restaurant I work at say we can ask for help, but it's really not feasible when there's hundreds of people in a restaurant and like 3-4 managers. Oftentimes it will take longer to find help from one of them than to just deal with what's going on. It seems like they really want good service for the customers but not enough to not create the most difficult conditions for it.\n\nLuckily I'm going to be out of this industry in a few months. Definitely gonna say some variation of this at my last preshift meeting.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677417643.0},{"title":"I just saw a Del Taco Worker get yelled at for being out of burgers","author":"Kiiaro","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11c7l5q\/i_just_saw_a_del_taco_worker_get_yelled_at_for\/","text":"I can't believe it.

Background, I spent almost 20 years in food service doing everything from washing dished to service director at a country club. Mostly I waited tables and it was actually one of my favorite jobs, mostly because of the people. One thing I learned is to not focus on what one table leaves you. If you do your job right, focusing on ensuring your customers have the best dining experience you can, then, over time, you will make plenty of $$$.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, on to my story...  \nDuring college, I worked at a place called O'Malleys. It's not open any more so I don't have to worry about getting anybody in trouble, and besides, this isn't that kind of story. No malicious compliance or petty revenge here, just a nice sweet story about how you can never tell about your tables.\n\nAnyway, every Sunday these two ladies and a little girl would come in and nobody wanted to wait on them because they were super cheap and never tipped, so I volunteered and they became my regulars. I quickly learned that it as a single mom, her young daughter and her mother. The always ordered the same thing, waters, with the two ladies splitting an entr\u00e9e and the young girl getting something off the child's menu. And no tip. I didn't really care because Sunday lunch was always busy with the after church crown, and their check was so small, even a 20% tip would have been  just a few bucks. Besides, they were super nice and I understood this was their special time out. Going out just wasn't something the could do. I did my best to treat them just like everybody else, which they appreciated.\n\nThis went on for over a year, every Sunday, they would come in after church in their pretty dresses, sit in my section, order the same thing they always did and not leave me a tip, until  one day they did. \n\nThat one day they came in and ordered iced tea and a soda for the girl. I knew something was up. The two ladies each got their own entr\u00e9e, nothing elaborate, but still. The little girl got a full order of chicken strips. (Not sure why I remember exactly what she ordered.)  Of course I asked what the celebration was. I mean it was obvious this was a special occasion. \n\nThe mother of the small girl smiled at me, \"I just graduated from nursing school. We wanted to come see you one last time and say thank you for making our Sunday's out so special. It meant so much to us to come in here and be treated like everybody else even though we could never order very much or leave you a tip. We're moving to Dallas this week and we won't be coming back. I got a job at Parkland(big hospital in Dallas, where they took JFK) and we won't see you any more.\" \n\nI smiled and wished them the best of luck, letting them know I'd miss them. When I picked up their check, they had left me a fifty dollar tip; \\~150% of their bill. (This story took place in the early 80's, so yeah, three people could eat lunch for $30 )\n\nMoral of the story is, don't worry about one tip.

This couple decided they would tip at the end of the meal which wasn\u2019t uncommon but once they were going to give me the tip they said \u201cHere\u2019s $20 and it\u2019s just for you.\u201d Now my honesty was my downfall in this situation becauseI said \u201cOh thank you but we actually pool all of our tips here because we all work hard.\u201d They said \u201cWe only want to tip you and if we can\u2019t do that we won\u2019t tip.\u201d I told them that I would have to ask my boss and see if this was ok because I wasn\u2019t comfortable breaking company policy. So I went to my boss, told him the situation, and he said take the money. I was supper happy for about a second and a half because then he said just make sure they see you take the money and when they leave out it in the tip jar because we don\u2019t do direct tips as you know. I\u2019m all for doing what the boss says but I hate lying to customers. But I went out there, took the money while lying that I could have the direct tip and then after they left I put it in our tip jar. Now I haven\u2019t forgotten this story and there\u2019s a couple reasons why. First of all I was not the only person to help this couple so the fact that they would only want to tip me is both flattering and annoying. I know my coworkers are amazing and super nice so they should\u2019ve been happy to have the tip shared amongst the staff. Secondly I felt ridiculous going to my boss and asking if I could take a direct tip and I felt even worse when he told me to take it and lie. When you too understand that your tip will help people who are helping you, it could be one person or it could be the whole restaurant but don\u2019t deny a tip because you don\u2019t like where it\u2019s going.","upvote_ratio":0.65,"created_utc":1677357202.0},{"title":"Why don\u2019t people understand the concept of a waitlist?","author":"flowersfromneptune","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11bc7jp\/why_dont_people_understand_the_concept_of_a\/","text":"We use a system where we text message guests when we are on a wait list to let them know that their table is ready.

Recently got a new job after leaving an old one working retail in a big department store.  \n\n\nI just wanted to ask about things I've noticed, wondering if these are red flags, if I should start looking for somewhere new? The GM knew I had no server experience when he hired me.  \n\n\nWhen I was hired, I had 3 days of training. Those 3 days involved putting me on expo for 4 hours, then having me clean and close up. I didn't get to go out on the floor until my last day of training, where I followed around one server for an hour, then I was put in charge of about 11 tables by myself. I thought I was just in charge of a couple tables to get used to serving, but the other servers started getting mad at me that I wasn't taking more customers. All in all I served about 7 tables that night with zero experience.  \n\n\nI was told I was done training, but I said what happened, and the GM agreed to train me one more day (though he didn't look happy about it). I got put with another server who was much nicer and actually explained how to do everything, worked with me around the POS system, etc. I learned more that night than my entire training period.  \n\n\nMy first 2 shifts on my own went okay, I had a few hiccups, but I tried my best. Customers were very willing to be patient with me, so I was glad. But then it started to go downhill on my next shifts. My third shift, I got some really bad tables and I was alone and supposed to be serving the same 11 tables on my own, and about 9 were filled around the same time. I messed up a couple orders and had to buy them out of my tips, so that was a bummer. I got stiffed a couple of times, and I was having trouble finding time to even get food from the window.  \n\n\nMy latest shift was what made me decide to post this. It was super busy to the point we had wait times. Whole place was packed, 4 servers. Still not a ton of training, I haven't even hit my first pay period, but I heard my GM loudly complaining to other servers that I was shit and he \"doesn't pay me to stand around\" (I wasn't, I was desperately trying to keep my head up and constantly running since the host forgot to tell me she sat a few tables in my section) because I forgot to grab some food from the window. It's only my 4th shift off training and I still don't know what I'm doing all that much.  \n\n\nThe actual owner so far has been really nice, I think he's the GM's uncle. I was told to never ever ask the owner questions, but he offered to help me when I was struggling. I did take a chance and asked him a question (The GM also told me to stop asking him questions), and the owner was totally fine with me asking and even said that's what I should do.  \n\n\nLater in the evening, kitchen was getting to around hour wait times for food, so I went to the expo station to check on my ticket placement in the window, and was told to leave and they (the other servers) don't need me up here. I said I was just checking my ticket because the table was asking and they got a little hostile, telling me to get back to my section, so I did and apologized to the table that asked. I still made good tips at least.  \n\n\nI'm trying to see the good of continuing here, I just bought a few uniforms so I'd like to not let that $40 go to waste. Should I be looking for something new, or can this be smoothed over? Other people I've vented to said it's just growing pains and it'll work out, but I'm just not sure. I've never had this many issues at a new job before.  \n\n\nThanks in advance!","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1677352386.0},{"title":"I lied about my experience to land a serving job","author":"Concerned_Friend338","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11bcadd\/i_lied_about_my_experience_to_land_a_serving_job\/","text":"Today I got hired on the spot as a server at a Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.

This is gonna be a long one, so strap in.  For context, I work at a sports bar type restaurant known for wings and beer. \n\nIt was a super busy Saturday night and I was on like my 3rd or 4th day of pulling double shifts (12+ hours) and I was beyond tired.  I get sat a 2 top.  Easy, I think to myself.  I go over to greet and get their drink order and the lady scoffs and makes a comment that I took long enough to come over to them.  I\u2019m already thinking wtf because I had just watched them get seated not even two minutes prior.  I get their drinks to them quickly and ask if they\u2019re ready for food.  This is where it all began.  \n\nOur menu has a clearly marked section labeled salads with 6 to choose from, as well as a shrimp caesar salad that was part of our summer menu.  As I ask if they\u2019re ready for food, the lady says \u201cno I\u2019m not, do you guys not have salads?\u201d  I can see the salad section on the menu in front of her so I point it out and start to give a recommendation and she stops me and goes \u201cI saw those.  I don\u2019t want any of them.\u201d  I try to give them more time to browse but she insists they\u2019re ready and wants a salad but none from the menu.  I ask if shes tried our summer menu salad and show it to her.  It also shows a picture of it next to the description.  She seems content with it (the shrimp caesar salad) and I\u2019m like okay great I\u2019ll get that started.  \n\nThe food comes out quickly and I put her salad in front of her she goes \u201cis there dairy in this?\u201d  I was confused, busy and tired and I said \u201cits a caesar salad.\u201d  She goes mad.  On and on about I should have warned her there was dairy and how she can\u2019t eat this because shes VEGAN. This was the first I was hearing of any dietary restrictions. \n\nI offer her a menu and take the plate back to the kitchen.  I tell the kitchen and my coworkers because I\u2019m in shock that this VEGAN lady ordered the SHRIMP CAESAR salad.  What messed my brain up the most was she didn\u2019t even mention a problem with the shrimp.  Just the cheese within the dressing.  Everyone was just as baffled as I was. \n\nI go back to the table to see what I can get this lady and offer some of our beyond meat options.  She still insists on a salad.  Most are made with some type of animal product or another.  Left her with two options, our quinoa salad or our basic house salad.  Apparently quinoa is disgusting so she settled with our house salad.  \n\nThe house salad you choose your dressing.  She wanted olive oil and white vinegar on the side.  Cool.  Kitchen makes it asap and I bring it out.  Its plain lettuce and some garden veggies.  I check on her after a minute or two and shes not used the dressing and is eating it completely dry.  \n\nI ask how it is and she says \u201care your cooks tired or something?  This has no flavour.\u201d  I just looked at her husband who looked mortified and asked if could bring them anything else.  Dropped the check soon after and was left surprisingly an 18% tip.  Never saw them again, but still wonder how a woman in her 30\/40s didn\u2019t know that a shrimp caesar salad wouldn\u2019t be vegan.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677254889.0},{"title":"I literally had the sweetest table ever and I thought I'd share","author":"AbigailNichole","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/11atmah\/i_literally_had_the_sweetest_table_ever_and_i\/","text":"So a couple days ago I had these three older people walk in 2 guys and a girl and this one sweet man says \"I heard this Is the best pizza in Iowa\" and I laughed and was like \"you must have heard right\" and I sat them with some menus and got their drinks.

Since our town has a massive tourist industry and we're smack dab in the middle of Main Street, we get a lot of families stopping by. It's already not recommended to bring kids into the building since we pretty much ONLY serve wine, we also have a charcuterie board and sparkling Italian sodas that we use to make mimosas with but that's it. We're also in a historical building from 1855 that has all original walls, floors, and even some furniture. It's not very kid friendly to say the least; nonetheless, we still let people bring their kids in as long as they stay respectful to our building.\n\nThis brings me to last night. A couple came in with their two young children about 30 minutes before closing time, something already seemed a little off when the lady started pulling bottles off the wine shelf to show her 9 year old \"all the pretty wines\" and the younger kid only said the word \"champagne\" over and over again the entire time they were there (which makes me think that's one of the few words that kid even knows) they all eventually sat at a table while the parents got their flights, once they got them, the kids started running all around the building without the parents supervising them whatsoever. We tried explaining to the parents that the area is dangerous for kids to be playing in considering all the cracks in the floor and the literal tonnes of glass that is all around the building. The parents reigned in their kids for a little bit, but then as they continued to drink, they eventually let their kids go back to running around the building and grabbing things off the shelves with absolutely no care for their kids' safety. \n\nAfter a little while I noticed I didn't see the kids anymore so I did a walk-through of the building to find the two kids huddled around a bottle of wine in the bathroom, trying to get it open. I took the wine bottle away from the kids and went to go tell their parents about it, as I was approaching the parent's table I heard the loud **CRASH** and **THU-THU-THUNK** right behind me. I turned around and saw the shelf that we keep our wine glasses on its side, a mountain of broken glass, and two kids bawling their eyes out.

(And make you call) \n\nI know it frustrates many of you but please save our number and make that call.\n\nWe aren\u2019t being \u201cjerks\u201d but everything is balanced.  If we get hit with more than we anticipate, we don\u2019t have servers or food, and your experience is bad. And trust me, we know you will complain.  Regardless of the understanding of why things were slow or cold - we know you will complain.  \n\nSo here\u2019s the why: \n\nWhat seems like no big deal to you because we have the room-  it is a big deal.  It impacts the entire restaurant. \nYes, maybe we have tables but maybe we didn\u2019t schedule that extra server. \nMaybe we are short a cook. \nMaybe we are short a dishwasher.  \nMaybe even a bartender. \nBecause we didn\u2019t expect it. \nAnd we have to move a table.  \nThis requires we change the entire schematic of the dining room and how it is managed for the evening. \nWe have specific servers assigned to specific tables.  \nThe count and timing of each sitting is important.  \nA table of 8, (even 6) requires we reset our entire front of the house plan. \n (including Mona\u2019s) \n\nSo, we beg of you, please respect everyone in the building, make a call.  We don\u2019t bite (especially over the phone) and your experience will be soooo much better.  \nNobody will be stressed. \n\nMaybe we just need to ask you to change your timing so we can accommodate you.  Is that really too much to ask? \nWe will be immensely grateful.  \nAnd Your experience will be what we Intend. 5 stars. Not negative.\n\nPS: please do not move tables on your own. For all the same reasons and \nThey weigh a lot. We don\u2019t want to get sued when someone gets hurt. \nThe legs have been adjusted to level them exactly where they sit. \nIt scratches the floors. \n\nAgain, we don\u2019t bite. Just ask. Let us do it for you. You may have to wait a couple extra minutes but we\u2019ve never said no to a customer.  (Yet.)\n\nThis is a public service announcement, educational piece, and a call for a little respect.  \n\nWe are feeling blessed.  \nIt\u2019s been a busy weekend.  \nIt\u2019s still winter. \nIt\u2019s also the month of love so let\u2019s share a little of that and a whole lot of appreciation with each other.\"\n\n\n\nI would really appreciate some outside opinions on whether this is appropriate...or not. I don't even know what to say. \nI've been in the industry for 12 years and my partner for 18 and we have never experienced someone so out of touch with running any sort of team efficiently, better yet, an entire restaurant...or even a facebook profile.

I became really good friend with the server, let\u2019s call him B. B is this really bitter Turkish man, he hates everything and everyone and he doesn\u2019t ask for help but he never someone (whom he actually likes) needs help he will always be there for you. They found Bs oldest son dead in his bed from an overdose Thursday morning. He then calls me and ask me to come in and work for him that day and I of course get there and work. Normally at the karaoke 2 people work, 1 server and 1 bartender, I don\u2019t want to toot my own horn but I\u2019m really good at what I do so I work there alone. B is super thankful and so is the owner, the owner let\u2019s call him Z keeps begging me to come back and work them, he offers me what ever salary I want, but I really don\u2019t want to come back there, because I hate, HATE the owners fat lazy ass son (V), I can\u2019t stand him, nobody likes him. \n\nThey ask me to work Wednesday - Saturday so B can be home and grief, I say yes again. \n\nOn Friday I work on the floor and I\u2019ve got 2 bartenders in the bar. One guy called Calle, never met the guy before but we clicked well and he was good in the bar.\n\nFor the first time ever my little sister came to my work, she started out just with a soda to talk to me before the evening started but it ended with her staying all night. I thought it was really nice to have her there, but since I was on the floor I didn\u2019t really stay and chat with her or anything. Calles girlfriend also came by, she sat with my sister in the bar and sang karaoke together. Calle spent a bit of time talking to his GF and went out side the bar to kiss her from time to time. I don\u2019t really approve of hat since I think it looks unprofessional, but I don\u2019t really care.\n\nMy sister paid full price for everything she drank, and Calles GF drank non alcoholic so she got\nIt for free.\n\nThe owners son came up to me and asked if I could work Sunday since there was a football match and they would be quite busy and I said sure, even tho I hate working when there is a game.\n\nThe night ends and this fat fuck comes up to me, tells me that I\u2019ve done a great job and blabla, he then proceeds to say that tomorrow (Saturday) maybe I shouldn\u2019t have my sister in the bar.. I get confused and irritated straight away and ask what he is on about, saying that she paid full all night and that I didn\u2019t even spend time with her. \n\nHe then proceeded saying that we can\u2019t have all the staff having their family and GFs at work because it doesn\u2019t look good and that we don\u2019t do our job well when they are there disturbing us. I told him to go suck a bag of dicks and that I worked like a god damn god. And that he can work alone on Sunday.\n\n\nSaturday I\u2019ve got a group of 32 people, a group of 6, a group of 8 and some smaller tables. I work the floor alone and the fat fuck is in the bar until the real staff comes in.\n\nSince there is quite a lot for me to do I ask him to pour the beers on my way into the POS to ring it in. And from time to time the food is ready before I can ring in the drinks, but obviously I will ring it after I take the food out, but warm food goes before getting him a ticket. There is literally no reason for me not to ring shit in. But he starts to complain that I don\u2019t ring stuff fast enough and keeps on being in my face about it. I\u2019m getting really annoyed by this time so I tell him to shut up or leave. But he doesn\u2019t. He keeps on stressing me about small bullshit stuff, just to show me that he\u2019s the boss. He doesn\u2019t seem to grasp that I don\u2019t need this job, I literally told my new place of work that I have to come to them later than we agreed on so that I could help my friend out. They need me, I don\u2019t need them. He seemed to understand this for a couple of minutes until he started to complain about something else for no reason. By now I\u2019m fuming so I told him to either shut the f up or he doesn\u2019t have a server this evening and he could take all these people himself.

The man began cursing at me.  I\u2019ll just type the conversation lol:\n\nHim: \u201cDid you even fucking listen to me?  I said no damn kids near me!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI understand, sir, but your partner wanted to see this table.  This is also a family restaurant so I unfortunately can\u2019t guarantee we have any tables with no kids near them.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cWell you\u2019re supposed to listen to what the customer says.\u201d\n\nI apologize and explain again that it\u2019s a family restaurant.  We then proceed to walk around the entire restaurant, but there was lots of kids, as always.\n\nWe finally get to the last table available, and of course, there\u2019s a kid next to it.

You need to learn to respect your fucking customers.\u201d\n\nHe stormed towards the exit and as he was leaving I replied with: \u201cHave a great day!\u201d\n\nHad a good laugh about it with my coworkers when it died down and I told them what happened.

I really appreciate it. I've never been in this situation before and I tend to expect the worst. After all of your comments and suggestions, I think I'm going to trust my gut on this one. Time to find a new job. \n\nBackstory TLDR: Restaurant that I currently work at and love is being sold to a corporate chain. New ownership takes over beginning of March.\n\nWe finally interviewed with the new management company last week. Honestly I've heard such awful things that I didn't even want to interview, but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and go anyway.\n\nI showed up early so I could be the first one in and out. I didn't want to sit there all day. They called me over at noon and then I proceeded to sit there while the new owner did something on his phone. I don't know if he was texting, finishing up an email, or idk playing candy crush, but I sat there for a good 4-5 minutes before he even acknowledged me. First red flag.\n\nAbsolutely the worst interview I've ever had. It was very clear this new company doesn't give a rats behind about my reputation, my seniority, or who I am as an employee. All they care about is how close I live to the restaurant, how available I am, and how willing I would be to but my life on hold to come in last minute if they needed me. They seriously asked me how willing I would be to cancel social obligations in order to come in last minute. When I hesitated, because what an absolutely asinine question to ask in an interview, they noted that I hesitated and kind of made a stink about it, even though I ultimately said yes?  I mean I do a LOT for my current restaurant...but that's because I care about the place and love the people. I don't know how I feel about canceling plans last minute to pick up shifts being a regular expectation of me.\n\nBeyond that, they were just not welcoming or inviting at all. They couldn't even pretend to care about anybody. Such an awful feeling when the current ownership is very kind.\n\nI have heard rumors that after the interviews they are planning on firing everyone that is FOH. I honestly hope they let me go. I get that a job is a commitment and I am willing to commit but the way they framed it made it seem like I'm basically on call every day and will be reprimanded if I can't show up last minute. I don't think I could work at a place like that.\n\nWould any of y'all quit? Or am I being dramatic and I should stick it out?\n\nTL;DR: New ownership sucks and expects employees to be on call and willing to cancel plans last minute in order to pick up shifts. Employees need to live close enough to the restaurant in order to be able to do this.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676747193.0},{"title":"Looking at a possible fine dining position, and looking for advice :)","author":"Global_Celery2173","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/116axye\/looking_at_a_possible_fine_dining_position_and\/","text":"For reference, I do have experience in the restaurant industry- I was an SA for a very busy & renowned brunch spot around my city for about a year and a half, mainly working on the weekends when they were packed.

When the box office did open he went right up without a mask and asked for his tickets to see the show. They told him his tickets were for Fridays showing and that it\u2019s Wednesday. He obviously gave it to them and continued towards the theater entrance. Ushers generally open doors to seating at 7pm and he was there at 6:10pm giving them a hard time telling them he should be allowed to go and sit,  and he doesn\u2019t need someone to tell him where he can and can\u2019t sit.

I didn\u2019t mind because I still had work to do, and they were nice. I finished my closing duties, cashed them out, and let my manager know that they were finishing up their drinks. That\u2019s when she walked over to them and tried to let them know that she had about 20 minutes of work left, and they were welcome to stay. \n\nThe problem is, she always talks with a very abrasive tone, so even though she was telling them that they could stay, they took it as, \u201cget the hell out,\u201d and immediately got up and left. \n\nIt was such a strange interaction, but I chalked it up to a misunderstanding; however, a couple of days later, I had a table who was upset about ticket times. Their food was almost ready, so I asked my manager if she would run it when it came out and apologize for the wait. Instead of running their food, she walked over to them empty handed and began speaking to them. \n\nI don\u2019t know what she said, because I was busy expoing their food, but I watched them get up and walk out just as their food was ready. Manager seemed completely unbothered and didn\u2019t explain what happened. I had to throw away their freshly made meals. At this point, I\u2019m resolved that I will never ask her to speak to my tables again, because the way she talks just rubs everyone the wrong way. \n\nLater that night, another table was angry about the same long ticket times, and actually walked up to my manager to ask what was going on. After a couple of minutes, they too decided to leave, again, just as their food was coming up. All I could do was stare in disbelief as a 3rd table walked away. Just bizarre to me. \n\nThen, on Valentine\u2019s Day, we were very busy, but everything was going smoothly. One of my tables was a 6 top with a toddler. As I was going over to check on them, I realized they were all standing up and looked upset. They asked if they could pay, but they hadn\u2019t gotten their entrees yet, so I asked them what was going on. They told me that my manger told them to leave. \n\nI was so confused, but also very busy with 7 other tables, so when my manager came up, I left in hopes that she would take care of it. On the contrary, they began to argue and eventually, my table accused her of being racist, paid for their drinks and appetizers, and left. \n\nFrom what I can gather, my manager told them that people were complaining about the noise the toddler was making, but I was unaware of anyone making any complaints. I just couldn\u2019t believe she had made another one of my tables leave!\n\nMy GM is extremely hands off and doesn\u2019t seem to care about the daily going ons of the restaurant, so I doubt he will care if I talk to him about this. I\u2019m just so frustrated and worried about this happening again. \n\nEven though I love my restaurant and make good money, I\u2019ve been job searching and hope to escape this crazy lady soon.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676652668.0},{"title":"My favorite family","author":"HollyGoLightlyCrazy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/114q6wk\/my_favorite_family\/","text":"I waited tables back in the early 90s.  Worked at rising popular chain steakhouse in So FL.  I was putting myself through college, replacing my life after Hurricane Andrew, and worked \\~4-5 nights a week.  Prior to working at this place, I worked at another popular restaurant in the area and had a loyal customer base.  I paid for college with big birthday \"gifts\", Christmas \"gifts, tax returns, etc. from my regulars.  I got to know their names and the families.  \n\nSo I had this lovely family that was from Haiti come into this steakhouse.  After waiting on them a few times, they started requesting my section.  The father was working on getting his MD license in the US as he was a doctor when he lived in Haiti.  They had twin girls and a son.  The girls loved me.  They brought me pictures they drew, hugged me when they came and hugged me goodbye.  Just the nicest people you ever wanted to see on an early Friday night.  It really set the tone for the evening.  \n\nOne Friday, I wasn't there.  Someone scooped them up.  Later the next day, they complained they only gave 10% since it wasn't me.  I said oh, that's what they tip me all the time.  So, I explained that someone else would make up for it and to them, they thought they were tipping the norm.  She huffed and said it wasn't worth it!  Really!??\n\nI explained my perspective.  What a lot of folks in the biz didn't understand about this was tipping was something that was learned via parents, family and friends.  People I worked with would complain about different races not tipping (they were also not necessarily Anglo-Saxon, but younger.)  I come from a mixed-race family and learned, as a child in the 70s, about racism on a road trip with my mom, my uncle and grandmother while visiting family in a southern state.  We weren't allowed in because my uncle was darker skinned, and they apparently still had segregation in smaller businesses in some parts of the country.  \n\nSo, six months later, this family call and say they want me for a party of 20.  The dad got his medical license and was celebrating by taking out his family and friends who helped him on his journey!  He also must have gotten a tip card with his new Amex.  He pulled me aside, very upset and explained he didn't know the standards and thanked me for being his favorite waitress.  Then handed me an envelope.  I told him it wasn't necessary, and he said use it for school.  Inside was $1250.  He then tipped me on his AMEX for a $500 tab $250!  After that, every time he came in, he would tip me 20-25%!\n\nI had to deal with drunk asshole men who tipped huge, and it made me feel dirty.  That family was good for my soul and spirit back in my early 20s, with 10%.

I have never served before and it could be a high stress environment at times, maybe just because I was new. There were no bussers, no food runners(which I didn\u2019t expect there to be), we had a host MAYBE Friday nights and Saturday mornings, and 80% of the time there was no to go person. We all ran each others food and as I was told there\u2019s no \u201cnot my job\u201d which is great in a way because, when done correctly, everyone helps each other out. I have never worked in a restaurant before so this may be normal in a time where everywhere is so short staffed. The job caused me a lot of anxiety but I stuck it out for 6 months until my last straw a couple days ago. Mind you, I was told I was one of the best servers there, even tho I would occasionally get flustered, because often I was one of the only servers running food or seating the door. Often petty drama would happen, like someone would get stressed and say something out of line but one of the supervisors was constantly talking about me, there was another guy who had it out for me, the cooks were very inappropriate and constantly getting away with it, and then I got tired of the amount of stress and work it took to make a mediocre amount of money. Anyways, I put in my 2 weeks. It always bugged me how people would just quit with no notice or call out most of their two weeks, but now I understand some of that. I was sucking it up and finishing my last week when I heard the supervisor was talking bad about me again. Mind you, she is the laziest person in the restaurant, never helps out like the higher up managers, and on multiple occasions when she was serving I\u2019ve had to take all her tables or literally got called in two hours early because she wanted to leave with no reason. It\u2019s sucks because I liked her and we related on a personal level, obviously not with work ethic. But when I heard she was talking about me again, I immediately called the store and said I was done with the disrespect and the one supervisor targeting me constantly. Oddly enough she was the one who answered the phone so it was awkward telling her she was the reason but I was glad to stand up for myself. I got it all on video because she did in fact lie about the reason I quit to the GM and my friends there are telling him the truth. Does anyone have any thoughts, comments, criticism on the whole situation? I know there\u2019s a lot of restaurant drama, but I feel that it\u2019s different coming from a supervisor who is 20 years older than me and when it\u2019s only ever about me. Also, isn\u2019t that an excessive amount of work, having to host, serve, run food, bus my tables, do carry out, and sidework, among other things?? You get used to it after a while but with no plans to hire those positions and with the amount of money I was missing out on because I couldn\u2019t focus fully on getting my tables in and out, it\u2019s kind of ridiculous.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676701347.0},{"title":"Is it weird to go from a server to a host somewhere else to get into fine dining?","author":"No_Put_8084","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/1154hnn\/is_it_weird_to_go_from_a_server_to_a_host\/","text":"Basically, I have only worked for gastropubs and casually brewery serving environments.

Our restaurant is located inside of a hospital. Today a guy comes in and he's deaf. I start off saying, \"Hi what can I get for you today?\" He tries to tell me he's deaf so I proceed to grab a pen and a piece of paper. On the paper I write, \"Pasta Bowls?\" He writes, \"Can I get $2.00 for the bus?\"\n\nI didn't have $2.00 on me so I proceed to ask my coworker if she had $2.00? She said no but she decided to go into one of our cabinets and grab two singles. I gave the guy two singles for his bus fare and I thought that was all he wanted.\n\nHe then directed me to grab the paper again and he wrote on it, \"Hungry\". I originally thought he wanted food, but then he wanted money for the bus, and now he's saying he's hungry for food. I assumed he wanted free food since he was already asking for money to catch the bus.\n\nI pointed my finger up at the guy to try to tell him \"Hold on\". He then starts muttering like how deaf people mutter. I went back into the office to let my managers know what was going on. They told me, \"You aren't supposed to give anyone handouts. It's against Hospital policy. Also what happens sometimes is when you give them something out they expect you to do it all of the time and then they can start inviting people they know, etc.\" The main manager told the other manager you could explain this policy to him or you can just call security.\n\nHe called security. Before security got there, we were starting to get really busy and he began begging people in line. Someone from security came in and told him to come on. The manager did tell them over the phone that he was deaf.\n\nShortly thereafter after security got him, from all the way down the hall, the guy starts YELLING and GRUNTING REALLY LOUD where everyone in the restaurant could hear him. I believe he was getting upset and frustrated because he wanted something to eat, but security was trying to get him out. I felt really bad at this point.\n\nThe guy comes back in with a security guard and he proceeds to point his finger at me. I was getting worried at this point. I felt like the guy was mad at me. The security guard stated that he will pay for his lunch. My manager proceeds to serve him and the security guard paid for his meal.\n\nMy coworker told me, \"You should've just gave him a bowl to get him out of here or you should've just told him no from the beginning. You could've handled it yourself.\"\n\nI would've felt bad just telling him no altogether; especially considering he's deaf. When he mentioned he's hungry I didn't really know what to do at that point which is why I went to my managers.\n\nI really hope the guy didn't think I was the one who called security since security came when I came out.\n\nAll in all could I have handled this better or differently?","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1676630133.0},{"title":"I absolutely DESPISE rude customers.","author":"__WorkThrowAway__","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/114wxtq\/i_absolutely_despise_rude_customers\/","text":"This happened last night while I was serving at my restaurant.\n\nJust for some context, my restaurant is what you would consider higher-end Asian fusion. My customer base usually is 20% regulars, 30% locals, 50% tourists (domestic and international) as we are located in a very touristy area of my city. I felt like this was important to include because 99% of customers are respectful, even international customers, despite the cultural differences.\n\nOur last call is at 7:15 and we noticed that we still had a reservation under a woman's name for a party of five at 7:00, let's call the woman Karen. We're pretty strict about our last call time because it takes on average approximately 2 hours for the kitchen staff to close their side and they don't normally begin to start closing until 8 PM because of the last-minute orders. Karen comes in with a party of 5 at 7:20 and we had to seat her because she had a reservation for 7:00 PM. We notified her of last call and she was considerate as she put in her orders at 7:30, profusely apologizing for coming in late. So far so good, they're late, but at least they're nice and considerate, right? Nope. Once they settled down and some food started making its way to their table, I go over and inform them that we gave them a grace period of about half an hour to finalize their orders as the last call was supposed to be finished by 7:15. I asked them to finalize their order and that if you needed to add anything, including drinks, now is time to do that as it was currently 7:40.\n\nThis is where it all started to go to shit.\n\nThey asked for a menu and to give them another 10 minutes. I asked my manager and he said it was okay. I go back after 10 minutes and they said they were okay with what they had ordered and didn't need any more food. I rush to tell the kitchen that all orders were in so that they could start closing. I go back onto the floor and asked the Karen table if they needed anything. Karen, who seemed like the ringleader with her little cult of adult teenagers started demanding stuff. Before I could finish my sentence, she told me verbatim \"go get me napkins.\", which caught me off guard. I get them napkins and once I lay them down on the table, she told me to \"go get them new plates because they were dirty\". At this point, I'm pissed off that they were talking to me this way. I'm your server, not your fucking dog. DO NOT SPEAK TO ME LIKE THIS. I thought - okay, you want to be rude right? After coming in late and holding us from closing? Ok. You got it. I tell the busser to switch out their plates and don't check up on them for the rest of the dinner. Their waters were filled accordingly, but that's it.\n\nFast forward to 9:15 PM, they were the only table here and normally, we would be able to leave by now as the restaurant would be empty. Karen and her table were drinking Sake and chatting as if they were long lost friends catching up while drinking coffee. I walk over and ask them if they needed anything. They asked me if they could place an order in for dessert. **LOOOOOL.** My exact response was \"uhh, the only dessert we have is a pudding at this time because everything's closed down, but I need to check if we have any leftover from service\". She screamed at me to \"go check\", no please, thank you, or anything, followed by laughter from her little minions. At this point, I've had enough. I felt disrespected and just thought to myself \"fuck this table\".\n\nAlthough we had some pudding left over from service, I told her that we were out. She asked to put in a drink order but our bar closes stops taking orders the same time we begin doing our last call. Although the drinks she requested could've been made, I told her that I needed to \"check with the bar\". I walk over to the bar and pretended to ask the bartender but in actuality, I was telling the bartender to shake his head signaling a \"no\". I did this on purpose as their table was in direct view of the bar, so I ensured that they saw him shake his head. I walk back and informed them that the bar is closed and they can't make the drink. She responded with \"Come on, you should've checked with us before. I'm tryna entertain guests here\". LOOOOL??? HUH? I literally did???\n\nI bit my tongue, apologized, and dropped their tab. They asked where they can get dessert around here, and I told them there was an ice cream shop 10 minutes away by Uber. That said ice cream shop was in fact closed already, but again, fuck them. Karen told me she's a local and lives by the ice cream shop. I said \"nice\" and walked away.\n\nThe fact that she was a local being a total bitch is embarrassing and shameful. Tourists who may have totally foreign values than us are very respectful, why are you not?\n\nMoral of the story: be nice and respectful to your server. It takes little effort and most of us are willing to go above and beyond to cater to your needs if you're respectful to us. Also fuck you, Karen. If you're reading this and you put two and two together with your two braincells in your peanut sized brain, double fuck you and your posse of minions. Get your attitude checked & get off your fucking high-horse.\n\nTLDR: Karen was late to her reservation. Prevented us from closing at our normal closing time. Seemed nice, respectful, and courteous at first, but ended up being a rude bitch who missed out on dessert for her and her guests because of her rude demeanor.\n\nP.S The kitchen staff left at 10:30 PM and I don't even want to know what time the wait staff left because I left at 9:30 PM & bitch Karen was still there.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676666264.0},{"title":"Getting scammed by my employer.","author":"Prestigious_Bowl2533","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/114sjfp\/getting_scammed_by_my_employer\/","text":"I\u2019m simply writing this with hopes that one of you beautiful people will see how unbelievable this whole thing really is.

Because I do. We had a mandatory work night at the restaurant I work in last week. It was absolutely slammed. Under stress I sometimes I have daydreamer seizures. They aren't usually severe or detrimental to my work. Most people couldn't even tell I have them unless I tell them and explain the signs then they say ooooohhhhh that makes sense. Slurred speach at random, starring into space for a few seconds, being a little overwhelmed if I feel like I lost any time...those sort of things. They last a few seconds and are over no one I work with has had a problem with this and to be clear before I was hired I informed them I have dyslexia and siezures so I may be a little slower but it truly has not hindered me until it allegedly did...\n\nWe have a FOH that I have butted heads with for many reasons. She has also had problems with customers claiming she would not allow them in when she was working, which she has zero authority to do and has had multiple arguments and issues with other employees. Don't ask me why she still has a job. I'm looking for another one. She spent the entire night undone about what people did on the shift before (not cleaning properly-also I didn't work this shift) I could really give a sh*t they didn't clean up, I get it, we make $2 and some change an hour....so I clean up the mess and never said anything about it because I don't care. My GOD she did though. I had to endure her wrath for the next few hours. I was backhandedly called stupid at one point which I forgot about until another coworker came to me and said she thought that was uncalled for because it had to do with reading and they all know I have dyslexia she actually did this 3 times in the night (making problems about me typing in wine names instead of searching through the one f*cking hundred wines we have on the computer). She was all over me about being to slow to get several different wines, teas, sodas and waters for a large party where some people ordered more than one drink. At this point in the night after about 10 different things she said that I can't really remember all of because there was nothing educational or helpful I start getting upset. I had a small seizure right before getting the drinks and another during when I was making sure the wines were filled evenly, I had other tables too so I had some stress. I felt it happen, I moved on but she dug in about how long it took (after delivering the drinks my table asked for more time with the menu-I don't even think it took as long as she said because of this, but I can't be sure). I had enough though later in the night when I thanked and hugged the people at the table for their very generous tip ( we had a good vibe going I asked if I could give them a hug they said yes.) She was undone and said we don't behave like that with customers. I literally don't care. (This woman yelled at me that she would fire me because she had an argument with another coworker like 2 weeks before this whole event....I won't be taking her advice on how to treat people.) They all freaked out that I made over $100 on my first 4 tables....I treat my customers like they matter because it means a lot to me when they give me literally anything because they don't have to. I left in the middle of the shift after I worked 2 hrs. I apologized at a later date to her about my reaction because at one point I told her I no longer gave a shit about what she had to say (I should have just kept it at that). After apologizing and explaining that I was having a seizure when she was getting on to me that night....this actual f*cking b*tch said, \"that's a problem.\" What the actual f*ck is that...? I've never heard something so heartless in my life. My response was that everyone who mattered in the hiring process knew I had disabilities and they chose to hire me anyway and her constantly berating before, during, and after a seizure in no way helped anyone, not even one person. She glazed over that to tell me I didn't wipe a station the day before that apology......y'all that station was f*ucking spotless I can't stress that enough \ud83d\ude02 I can not with this petty drama. I'm literally dying and no one knows except the people who read this. I have kidney damage (which is a possible trigger for the seizures) that is seemingly getting worse. Can't afford the medications I have to take which is why I work this job in the first place outside of the owner really needing employees -kill two birds with one stone and all but I can't imagine why no one would want to be around this hateful firebreathing she-devil. Literally spent precious time I barely have scrubbing food of the floor on my f*cking knees for it to not matter and to get treated like dog sh*t the entire night anyways.

It's more than a little disheartening that even with that kind of support two days don't go by where there's not someone asking about something super sketchy at their job.\n\nFor anyone in the U.S., here are the signs that your server job isn't on the level.\n\n* You were told your first shift\/week\/month was an unpaid time to see if you could handle the job.\n   * This is illegal, they're trying to get free labor from you.\n* You interviewed for a server job but they hire you as a host\/busser with the promise of a promotion.\n   * They don't want you to be a server but need to fill a job, don't expect to become a server anytime soon.\n* You didn't fill out any paperwork before starting the job or you're not getting paystubs on payday.\n   * This is probably illegal and they're not reporting\/paying any payroll taxes for you. In some states you may need to ask to receive your paystub. Also it's possible that you'll only get a digital record of that information. In any case if management won't give you that information it's a big red flag. (thanks to u\/JelmerMcGee)\n* You don't understand how tip out\/tip pool works.\n   * This is generally illegal, but possibly just shady. If you share tips or have a tip pool you're entitled to a written policy explaining how it works.\n* Managers get a share of the tip pool.\n   * This is generally illegal in every state except in very narrow circumstances, i.e. an hourly supervisor is included when employees agree to a specific policy. Salaried employees\/owners cannot be part of tip pools.\n* You're expected to do sidework \"off the clock\", managers change the time you clock-in\/clock-out, you don't get paid more for overtime.\n   * This is illegal.\n* You didn't get a check\/paystub on payday (or your check bounces) and the manager told you there was a problem with the payroll company.\n   * They're lying (or are being lied to by the owner), the restaurant didn't have the money to pay you.\n* You're expected to pay for walkouts\n   * This is illegal. You can be disciplined for walkouts but they can't take money from you. Often restaurants will say you have pay for the walkout or take the disciplinary action. Take the write up and then find another job.\n* Mangers, customers, or co-workers who engage in any form of abuse (verbal, sexual, etc.) are tolerated.\n   * If they don't have your back for small things, they won't for big things. Get out now.\n* You serve alcohol but were never taught the state\/local laws regarding the sale of alcohol.\n   * You're putting yourself at risk of a big fine. You have personal liability if you break the law regarding the sale of alcohol.\n* You're told to bend\/break liquor laws, i.e. serve someone without I.D.\n   * They want you to break the law...\n* You're told you can't talk about your hourly wage\n   * Yep, that's illegal too.\n* If your restaurant is \"family owned\" and you're not literally part of the family don't expect them to be loyal to you. Also, the smaller the restaurant the more likely they are to cut corners, either because of ignorance or negligence. (thanks u\/donaldtrumpsmistress)\n\nAside from quitting\/walking away from these jobs, it's important to help weed out bad owners. If you experience almost any of these situations you're protected by state and federal law.\n\nThe US Department of Labor has good resources regarding your rights\n\nYour state's Wage and Hour Division (it may have other names) is usually looking for tips from employees and often pays a bounty or helps employees recover lost wages. Search for \"\\[Your state name\\] Wage and Hour Division\" and look for the result that connects to a state operated website.\n\nI know this list isn't complete and there's other things that can be done to look out for each other. If you have suggestions to add to the list, state level resources, or anything that can help, please feel free to add them and I'll try to update this post.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676575307.0},{"title":"High Tip Out Percentage to Bartender?","author":"sinfulquinn00","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/113zbod\/high_tip_out_percentage_to_bartender\/","text":"Today I just found out after three months of working at my current restaurant that I am tipping out 3% of my TOTAL sales to the bartender, not drink sales.

My $1000 weeks very quickly become $750 or $800 weeks. I tried to ask the owners about it with no response. I asked some of my server friends about it who work at other restaurants and they never have to tip out more than 2% of total sales or they give a slightly higher percentage of drink sales. I\u2019ve realized this is the reason my checks have been so unimpressive (among other things, like the owners failing to add my first two months of auto gratuity to my check). Is this amount normal?

The wife is known to be coocoo for coco puffs. They were showed to their table and I wait until people have their butts in the seats to come greet them. \n\nWell I took too long (about 45 sec) because they were \"dying\" waiting on their drinks. I had to ask what their drinks were because they're not my regulars. She was already pissed at me.\n\nI gave them about 5 minutes with their cocktails and came by to ask if they would like more time with the set menus. She told me in a special tone that they needed time to enjoy their drinks. That was fine but I did need to get it rolling soon because there's a turn on the table. \nThey finally ordered and she told me in her special tone to make sure I do not rush them tonight. I told them I would not. \n\nFirst course they spend 20 minutes eating soup. They had empty soup bowls that they didn't want me to clear. Finally she waved me down and told me they wanted their next course. She pushed her soup bowl into my hands and then pushed her empty martini glass to the very edge of the table so I assumed I should take that too. She said \"no NO DO NOT TAKE THAT YET!\" Like loud enough for other tables to be like huh?? She was getting extremely irritable and her tone was really hostile.\n\nShe waved me down to take it a few minutes later, they did not want to be offered any more to drink, and as I was walking away she started talking shit about me. In plain voice where I could hear a couple tables over she said \"she is so strange, why is she acting so uncomfortable? Like she's afraid?...\" I tried to ignore it and walked faster.\n\nSecond course was another 20 minutes. They barely touched the salads and I asked twice how was it\/ if they were enjoying everything, finally asked if I could take the plates when they had their plates pushed away.\" No you certainly may not.\" Everytime I left the table I heard her talking about me like \"what is wrong with that girl? Is she new?Blah blah blah..\" Several minutes later I heard her direct her husband to wave me down because she was done speaking with me herself. He asked me to take their plates and they needed their next course to hurry up because they've been waiting a while. The same people who did not want to be rushed. I asked if I could box their salads. He said \"no we really just want the main course.\"\n\nI immediately brought them their intermezzo that comes out right before the main course and they both got upset. He said \"I said next course please, we've been here a little too long.\" I told him its on the way. \n\nI got it to them really quick and she had something to say about the presentation, she had never seen lobster presented like that, and I just didn't have time for it. I had five other tables.\n\nSame deal with the main course, they didn't want to give it up then waved me down and she was fuming. She said something being \"beyond ridiculous.\"  I asked is everything ok? She rolled her eyes at me and said, \"no, not everything is ok. Some things are fine but other things are not ok.\" Her husband said \"do me a favor, box the rest of this and we need the dessert yesterday.\" I said ok, I'll go do that.\n\nAt this point I was kind of shaking at the way they were talking to me and the fact that I heard some of her comments about me throughout the night (I might be low intelligence, Im not a good waitress, I behave too awkwardly, I'm sloppy, the owners hiring standards have gone down, etc) I didn't say another word to them after that.\n\nWhen I left the room the food runner overheard them talking and this lady was saying things about me that caused the food runner to approach our manager to speak with them. \n\n The manager dropped the check off and their leftovers and desserts. All my other coworkers who are familiar with them were saying they are a weird couple but that was over the top rude tonight. The food runner wouldn't tell me what she heard them say. Apparently they talked to the manager and they told her I had no sense of urgency and I needed some pep in my step and it seemed like I had no idea what was going on around me. The manager told me it was baseless BS. \n\nHaving people on my side didn't matter though. I'm not a crier. But I did cry two little tears during the V day shift and several after I got home. I think what really got to me is the bartender who usually serves them told me that I should forget it as quickly as they do because they won't remember who I am or that they treated me like shit next time they come in. \n\nI don't think I'll forget.

I was a bit busy, so I let them know I\u2019d be with them in a moment and went back to get them a basket of bread. As soon as I walked back to the table and introduced myself, they complimented me on my energy and how bubbly I was, and even told me that my makeup looked great and I just seemed like an all around fun person. I knew I had the best table of the night right then. I talked with them for quite some time after I brought drinks and appetizers, they asked me about all my favorites on our menu (I love when I get asked that because it helps to create a connection with the guest and figure out their likes and dislikes), and kept going back to hang out periodically after I took entr\u00e9e orders. \n\nI ended up finding out that these three girls go to the same college as my boyfriend. Further into the conversation, one girl tells me that the went to highschool in my hometown (Just to prove how small the world is, I ended up talking more with her over social media and discovered that we had the same 5th grade teacher and went to the same middle school as well!!) We all continued to get along, and I got their social medias and we all planned to hang out sometime next week!!! I even told them I had a music gig next month at a bar around their campus and they all pulled out their phones to mark their calendars. :\u2019)\n\nAt the end of their dinner I brought out checks and they asked me if I was going to be splitting my cash tips with the other servers. I told them no, and they handed me a $100 bill as a tip and told me I was the best server that any of them had ever had. My jaw dropped and I was trying so hard not to cry at the table. I have been struggling financially for the last month after paying a ticket and the insurance difference, and my shifts have been a little rocky with tips for the last few weeks. These three girls just paid for my groceries for the next two weeks and they didn\u2019t even know I was struggling, they just had such kind souls and wanted to share it with the world. I could see it from a mile away. \n\nAnyway, I hope we\u2019re allowed to post wholesome stuff on here as well, I just thought this would be the place to share. I\u2019m sure we all had a long Valentine\u2019s Day. There were some really nice guests, and there were bound to be guests on the not so nice side, but we all made it through!!!

I\u2019m a manager of a restaurant in PA. We\u2019re breakfast, coffee, lunch, only open until 3pm. Currently the servers make very decent money. Over 100 in tips on weekdays and usually over 400 in tips on weekend days. They are also paid $5 an hour. \n\nThe owner recently dined at a restaurant in CO that added a 20% service fee to the bill. I guess it stated that a certain percentage is given to the foh and a certain percentage to the boh. Any additional tips were the servers. Apparently she talked to the server and they said they loved it and it worked out well. \n\nShe\u2019s now trying to implement that into our restaurant, with much resistance from the servers. (Of course) Her break down for the 20% is something like 46% to the foh, 50% to the boh and 4% to managers. She\u2019s also adjusting all the servers hourly wage based on time there, work ethic\u2026 Some are going to make $8, some probably more, some $3.50. This isn\u2019t making sense to me or them as to how they will not lose money. I feel they need to be paid a wage around $15 per hour. That\u2019s what seems fair. \n\nFor people that have worked in places with a fee like that, what was your hourly wage and can you give some info as to how it all worked out?!\n\nEdit: Because everyone is commenting that managers cannot be apart of the tip pool. We are aware of these laws. It doesn\u2019t currently happen. But if there is a service fee added, that is not considered a tip and can be handled however the owner sees fit.

My first table of the day is a 5 top. A dude, his girlfriend, and 3 kids definitely all below 10. He first starts off by telling me he used to work there and is wondering if he can get a discount. I go to ask my manager. For this case let's call her Joy. I tell Joy his name and immediately she responds with \"HELL no!

Then another server appears to take over the table (host and other runners change and our prior server is nowhere to be seen, so I assume shift change). He takes care of us, refills our water, brings us another round of drinks and takes our dessert order.\n\nIn this case, how are tips allocated? Does it all go to one of the servers? Do they split it?

I take orders, I ring food in, I bring it out. At the end of the night I sweep and mop. Should be simple enough.\n\nWell lately, the restaurant I work at has been hiring a bunch of servers and neglecting other positions. We have plenty of servers available but we're severely shortstaffed when it comes to cooks, to-go specialists, and of course the subject of this rant post, hosts. We don't have anybody designated to host, so one of the servers is forced to stand up front to greet and seat customers. Management gets upset with us if guests wait at the door for more than 30 seconds without being greeted, but we can't always be there because we have jobs to do. I wasn't told during my interview that I'd have to host and help to-go during my shift while also being a perfect server. To make matters worse, I'm always clocked in as a server which means I'm making $3 an hour while not earning tips. At least full hosts get decent hourly.\n\nFridays are usually the busiest day for to-go and our chef today was inexperienced, so I (the hostess of course) started putting guests on a wait to give her a chance to catch up. 15-20 minutes, nothing crazy. As someone who *goes to restaurants,* that seems pretty standard to me, even on the low end of potential wait times. Well MOST guests, not some but MOST, decided to harass me... I had one \"lady\" (read: half ogre) ask me what the restaurant's policy on not seating her would be, and if she could speak to a manager to get me fired so they could hire a better hostess. Really fun\n\nI don't have what it takes to host. At least as a server, if a customer makes me uncomfortable I can always leave and hide in the kitchen. I'm moving around. As a host, you're stuck in place dealing with impatient dickwads who think it's perfectly okay to treat service workers like trash. I don't think I can handle one more person telling me \"but there's empty tables!!\" or \"can't we just sit down with menus and drinks?\" or \"how much longer, I'm STAAAARVING.\" People are actually starving out there, Melissa. Sit your ugly ass down and WAIT\n\nI guess to give this post a purpose I'll ask, how do I make it clear to my superiors that I will not be hosting anymore? If I'm going to be taking on all this extra work I at least want more pay for it. If I made regular hourly it would be different, but I need to be making tips if I'm going to make decent money.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1676088170.0},{"title":"Explain like I\u2019m 5\u2026 why am I getting a tax refund?","author":"elmbby","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10z5igf\/explain_like_im_5_why_am_i_getting_a_tax_refund\/","text":"I am grateful enough that I barely ever require hourly compensation at my serving job, I make quite a good amount from my tips.

There's been problems in the past where customers won't let you know if they've paid a deposit when you bring them their bill (servers don't always know, it's in the system managers use). The system we use won't let you refund a deposit after the bill's been paid, so customers then have to be referred to head office to get their deposit refunded. Because of this, we have a policy where we ask every table if they had a deposit with us tonight - just to be sure.\n\nAt least once a night, a table will ask for a bill and I ask if they had a deposit with us, and they'll say, verbatim, \"Yes! \u00a3100!\" Always those exact words. Always that exact amount. To them, they're making a \"joke\" but that's a not-unreasonable amount for one of our deposits.

I started at Ruby Tuesdays at 19. The money was great, but I loved the lifestyle. We partied every night and worked every day. I did this for about four years until I was fired. Why was I fired? New management came in and cleaned house. About 10 of us were let go for bullshit reasons. \n\nThis was a wake-up call. I realized servers could be fired at any time for any reason. I was devastated. Luckily I found another job relatively quickly. LongHorn steak house. This job was less fun, but the money was about 15 -20-% better. I decided to learn what it takes to work in fine dining to make as much money as possible.\n\nI talked with Management about moving to a high-end restaurant in the same company, The Capital Grill. They promised me if my sales were up and I was studying food and wine, they would transfer me. For the next year in a half, I studied and became the lead server. A friend of mine who was in upper management of Long Horn had informed me they don't transfer servers, and I never had a shot even though my store managers promised me they would. \n\nAgain I was devastated. One Friday night, one of the managers pulled me into the office to yell at me about a secret shopper. I did everything right but did not upsell cheese fries. She was going off. I was in shock. I knew my sales were much higher than everyone's, and at this point, I had four tables that needed my attention. \n\nI had had enough Long Horn was never going to promote me, and by this point, I knew how easy it was to get another Job. She asked me how I was going to rectify the issue. As if I had committed some unforgivable sin. I told her I wasn't and immediately quit. Now she was in shock. She knew I was her strongest server and tried to backtrack.\n\nI had never quit a job before, and it felt good. I went to the floor, asked my tables to cash out, and let them know what had just happened. All my tables did, and way overtipped me. At this point, The manager was fuming and said I would never work in the industry again. LOL\n\nAt this point, I decided it was time to apply to some fine-dining restaurants. My first choice was the best restaurant in the area SKY. They were trendy and had actual chefs and a crazy wine list. I got an interview, and the GM first asked me if I had experience in fine dining. I told him no but I had been studying food and wine for the last year and a half, and I promised I would work hard and do what it took to prove myself. So he took a chance with me. \n\nWithin a year, I was the head server. MY PPA (per person average) was higher than anyone. Management loved me, and so did the owner. I took this job very seriously. I had regulars that were worth millions, if not billions of dollars. I had worked at SKY for several years, making more money than I ever had. Then our GM leaves, and two managers get transferred. to sister restaurants.\n\nWe get a new GM, and he brings in his friends to manage and starts to clean house. Several servers were let go for no reason. I fear I might be fired too. The new servers he brought in were horrible. They were sloppy and lazy, and their PPA was the lowest. Yet they were given bigger sections and better shifts.\n\nThis upset everyone, myself included. One night after my shift, I tried and calmly talked with the new GM about how this affected our money and asked if there was a fair way to schedule. He exploded on me. I was shocked. I profusely apologized. I meant no disrespect, but he had heard enough and fired me on the spot. Again I was devastated.\n\nTwo days passed, and the restaurant owner called me up, apologizing he wanted me to return. I told him what had happened. How the GM spoke to me and how he was cutting our shifts to make room for his friends. I asked the owner to look at the numbers and asked him who he would rather have representing his company.\n\nThe owner agreed he would rather have me than the questionable new hires. I explained this situation had left a bad taste in my mouth, and I wasn't sure I wanted to return. He offered me 15$ an hour + the tips I would make if I returned instead of the standard 5$ server wage.\n\nI decided to accept and returned to work a few days later. For the first time in my serving career, I experienced a power shift. As soon as I walk in, I am summoned to the office. The GM is sitting behind his desk, and he looks pissed. He said the way I spoke to him and went behind his back was unforgivable. I again calmly explained what happened and reminded him he fired me. He said I should have dealt with the consequences like a man.\n\nHe said some things would be changing, my shift would be cut, and I would be put on a trial run to see if I could come back. I cut him off and said no, I won't. I will work my regular schedule with a fair section; if he doesn't like it, he can talk to his boss. (the owner) I thought the guy was going to start swinging. I have never seen someone so angry. He screams at me to get out of his office. \n\nI start taking tables and working my shift, and the GM comes on the floor while I'm at a table and pulls me by the arm to go to the office. This shocks the guest and me. The owner is in the GMs chair, and I sit next to the GM. The GM immediately starts laying into me, saying I'm a colossal problem. I calmly explained I had guests I was taking care of at the moment and asked if it would be possible to continue this conversation once my section was empty. The GM says no. The owner disagreed and said yes, we would talk after your shift.\n\nAs Im working my shift, I see every manager and chef go into the office to talk with the owner. They talked for a while. Once my section was empty, I knocked on the door and said I was ready to talk whenever they were. I change out of my uniform and am summoned to come back to the office. Im sure Ill be let go for some random reason.\n\nAs soon as I sit, the GM looks nervous but is still furious with me. The owner says we must squash this little beef and return to business. I agree, but the GM interjects and says I'm a huge problem. The owner says he has talked with everyone, and no one has a problem with me. He says my sales are the highest and has no guest complaints. The GM then went on about how I questioned his authority. I calmly explained if I couldn't make money here, I couldn't work here. \n\nWe had already lost three strong servers the last month due to them quitting, and he fired a few other people. The owner had heard enough. He told the GM to give me whatever shifts I wanted and change his attitude. I was told I could leave and to close the door. As I left, I could hear the owner screaming at the GM that he should fire him. I went home, but another server told me they were in the office for an hour, and the owner was going off.\n\nThe next couple of months were rocky. The GM wouldn't even look at me. One day I heard the GM and the new servers were fired. They were all stealing! About a year later, I left on good terms due to moving. I got another fine dining job and studied under a master sommelier and James Beard award-winning chefs. Unfortunately, That restaurant closed, and now Im at another fine dining job. It's a good company, and the money is excellent. I get whatever hours I want, and Im respected. \n\nI hope my story saves you some time and aggravation. I will list some bullet points below so that I can help you.\n\n1. If you know you will serve for a few years, apply to fine dining restaurants. Even if you don't think you are qualified. The difference in money is enormous. \n2. Stay away from hard drugs! I have witnessed many servers go down that path, which always ends badly.\n3. Management will almost always try and take advantage of you. They will throw you under the bus in a second if it makes them look good.\n4. There is NO job security in this business. Even if management loves you, managers come and go, and you might have a nightmare boss next week.\n5. Always have a backup plan. I only work two or three days a week and do my own business on the side. Rember NO job security. If the restaurant is going under, they won't tell you. They will lock the doors. \n6. Doing this job full-time with fundamentally damage you. Fake smiling and pretending will lead you to feel like a whore after a while. You have thoughts, dreams, and feelings, and you are entitled to them.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675899075.0},{"title":"What is the most ridiculous complaint you've had?","author":"Sapphire0143","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10xi2fn\/what_is_the_most_ridiculous_complaint_youve_had\/","text":"I had someone complain and demand her meal be free because she didn't know omelets had eggs in them. \ud83d\ude43\ud83e\uddd0","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675907853.0},{"title":"Tip was a $1.00 bill ripped in half.","author":"Cantwejustbenice","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10xk8bn\/tip_was_a_100_bill_ripped_in_half\/","text":"This was a long time ago when I was 18 working my first serving job.

She then told me to take the Pepsi back and \u201cfill it up all the way\u201d. It was a half inch from the rim. I filled it to the top and walked slowly back to her. I spilled a smaller amount on the table and she was mad. I cleaned it up and took their order. She complained about everything, but also ate everything. The food was always great at this restaurant and so her complaints were unfounded. The whole time she complained, her husband would say nothing, but would look at me sadly, like he wanted to say something but was scared of his wife. At the end of the meal, I gave them their check and thanked them for coming in and they left. I went to clean off the table only to find a $1.00 bill ripped in half as a tip from the woman.

Even better the food was excellent and the staff one of the best in town. We were always busy which made for a nice payday for ht6e waiters. I had a good group of regulars and did really well.\n\nNaturally, that doesn't mean it was all roses and sunshine. While 99% of the customers were great and easy to take care of, there is always that 1%., otherwise we wouldn't need this subreddit.  \nAnyway... On the night in question, I had opened the restaurant which meant I also got one of the best sections in the place. Five tables, three four-tops and two deuces, or two-tops. My first table of the night is the primary focus of our story. They were an elderly couple. She was as sweet as my grandmother, so let's call her 'grandma,'  and he; let's call him GOM for grumpy old man, was not in the best mood but wasn't being rude; yet. Of course there's Me.\n\nThey ordered drinks from the bar which is usually a good sign. When I returned with their drinks, they were ready to order their entrees, perfect. Easy-peasy, a nice simple start to a weekend night.\n\nI need to explain something about the restaurant real quick. The cook line is exposed to the restaurant, which is kind of cool. The prep area in back has the dish station, dry storage, the cooler and the freezer, plus a small office for the owner\/chef. Tucked in a corner is a table about 32 inches square where all food prep is done. Like I said, we're a steak and SEAFOOD restaurant. We're very proud that our fish is as fresh as you can get it 400 miles from the coast and the cooks do an excellent job of preparing it. They still do as I stop there whenever I go home to visit.\n\nThis little table is where all the steaks are cut, the desserts are mixed and prepped for baking or freezing in case of the ice cream pies, and the fish is scaled and portioned. Obviously, extreme care is taken to keep this area clean, but sometimes things happen. Queue GOM...\n\nOne of our more popular seafood entrees is the bay scallops, small dishes of super rich goodness floating in drawn butter and appropriate seasoning. And yes, they are portioned and prepped on that same little table where the fish is scaled and portioned. I'm thinking you can guess where this is going.  Yup, GOM ordered the scallops and I made sure to inform him what an excellent choice he had made. I don't remember what grandma ordered but it's not really pertinent. I had delivered their food and was getting waters for the two new tables in my section when I heard GOM's voice,   \nGOM: \"Boy!\" Kind oif rude because I always introduce myself when I approach a table and I'm 6'3\", not exactly a boy, but whatever.  \nMe: Yes sir, can I get you something?\"  \nGOM: \"What the heck is this in my food?\" He points at what appears to be a small piece of chewed plastic on his plate next to the dish the scallops came in.   \nME: \"I am so sorry sir. Let me take care of that and I'll get you a new order of scallops as quickly as I can.\" I took the little chewy thing(it would turn out to be a fish scale) and his scallops and went to get a new order, making sure to let the owner\/chef know exactly what happened. A quick discussion ensues and naturally, GOM's meal is comped.  \nI stop at the waiter station on the way back to my section to get waters for the two additional new tables in my section, dropping them off before going back to GOM to let him know it would be a few minutes, apologizing again, letting him know it was just a fish scale and with us being a seafood restaurant serving fish as fresh as we can get it, sometimes things happen. I also let him know that his meal was taken care of.  \nWhat followed was a diatribe, a lecture, a rant, a tirade that any politician would be proud of. GOM accused me and the restaurant of trying to poison him.  He threatened to contact the health department, to sue. He even questioned my intelligence and my capacity to do my job, and he wasn't doing it quietly. When I had the chance , I would apologize again and reassure him it was an anomaly, that it wouldn't happen again and that the owner of the restaurant was paying for his meal. I even threw in a piece of cheesecake on my own just to make him happy. One of the other servers brought over his new order of scallops and I waited while he searched for another spurious fish scale. He finally let out a huge harrumph and dismissed me with the wave of his hand.  \nI was now seriously in the weeds and went to my four other tables, all of whom had just witnessed what I had been through and got their drink orders and told them I'd be right back to take their food orders. Each in turn, they all told me not to worry about it. They understood.  \nWhat happened next is proof that no matter what, there is hope for humanity.  \nI drop off all the drinks and start with the first table to arrive. Pretty standard orders until I get to the last person, the guy that is getting the check;   \n\"You know, I've heard that you have the best scallops in the state. I love scallops.\" His delivery is getting a little effected, \"Only thing is, I like a little more body in my meals. Can you do me a favor and see if you can find some fish scales in the back and maybe add them to my order, you know, make them a little more chewy.\"  \nMe: \"Yes sir, I'll see what I can do.\" Subtle grin crosses my face as I know GOM heard every word.  \nTable 2, again the last guy to order, \"Hey, I heard that guy order. Do you think I could get some of those scallops with extra fish scales, too?\" Grin gets bigger.  \nTable 3; \"Scallops with fish scales.\" Even bigger grin.  \nTable 4, yup. All four tables ordered scallops and asked loudly, for fish scales. It took everything I had not to burst out laughing.  \nI made sure to stop by GOMs table to check on him and grandma and to see if they needed anything else. \n\nThis time grandma answered. \"Just two cups of coffee.\"\n\nMe: \"Yes ma'am, and I'll be sure to bring you your cheesecake, too.\" I picked up their plates and glanced at GOM who somehow looked six inches shorter than he had when they came in. He couldn't even look at me.  \nI turned in my new orders and told the owner what had happened. He didn't even try to not laugh, hey, it's his restaurant.  \nI took GOM and grandma their coffee, cheesecake and the check. They managed to slip out while I was taking care of the rest of my section. When I picked up the check, GOM had left me enough cash for the bill and a fifty dollar tip.

New sections would have 2-4 tops and we would take turns serving larger parties. This meant Lily would have our sections with more large parties than small. We would take the \u201cbad\u201d bussers and she got assigned with a good busser. \n\nThroughout the night whenever Fred and I passed each we kept chuckling.

This restaurant was a bit pricey and all they served was cheese and small plates, but all cost over $20 each. It was the only restaurant with seating at the time so we can said screw it and ate there. \n\nWe were seated upstairs outside on the balcony. Great view and some heaters, but with the wind, you could barely feel the heat. It was cold as shit, essentially. The table we are sat at, the chairs are covered in water (rained all day). Didn\u2019t even think about it until I sat down and my entire ass and legs were soaked. My mom immediately was like let\u2019s move tables and I was just so nervous and upset.\n\nMy thinking was I didn\u2019t want to be the annoying patron who asks to move tables (even though the entire balcony was empty) I was worried about upcoming reservations or just coming across as \u201cone of those people.\u201d I complain to my mom no let\u2019s deal with it we don\u2019t want to complain. She\u2019s bewildered, like, why would we not want to sit somewhere comfortable and not wet? So she asks that we move and the server switches us. Mind you, my legs and all are still soaked and it is freezing outside, so the entire experience was still uncomfortable as hell the entire time.\n\nSo we get a cocktail each and of course they\u2019re expensive as hell. We share 5 plates which are also expensive as hell. (We chose the place - it is what it is.) cocktail was pure alcohol. I understand some love this, but I\u2019m not one of those. I don\u2019t prefer drinking straight vodka in a cocktail with no other flavors. My mom suggested we tell our server and have them re made. I tell her hell no, we will just cause issues and the server will again judge us as we have already asked to move tables. So we deal with it. \n\nThe food we order was not what I expected and the first dish I tried I hated. I truly wanted to say I did not like it and order another dish I think I\u2019d prefer, but again, I did not because that to me seemed ridiculous and would cause issues for the staff.\n\nNight goes by, we are finished and it\u2019s time to pay. We both know we want to split the bill, so I ask. I feel so shitty asking because I\u2019m thinking, \u201cthis server is probably judging us to split the bill and now they have to split it exactly how we want to and take their time doing so.\u201d I felt so awkward asking. \nThe bills came back split incorrectly and though I was brokeish and preferred to pay for only what I bought, I decided fuck it. I can\u2019t ask again and just paid as was and gave a 20% tip. \n\nEssentially, I let a lot slide all while being freezing in wet clothes just praying I don\u2019t get sick as I need to preserve sick days at work. I paid a lot of money and tip for that experience meanwhile the drinks, experience and food were all sub par. \n\nNow I think to myself, I am coming in as a patron and have dealt with much much worse as a sever, so why am I so afraid to speak my mind and have issues addressed and resolved as a customer? \n\nI would love feedback from other servers and your dining out experiences. Is it also difficult to voice your concerns as a customer? It feels unfair to myself to spend so much cash and make myself deal with the things I\u2019m not okay with just because I don\u2019t want to seem annoying or complain about a thing when I dine out.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1675704265.0},{"title":"30minute sidework rule","author":"Wild472","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10ukton\/30minute_sidework_rule\/","text":"Who I need report to?

ANYWAYS.\n\nThis 60 something woman came in to meet her cousin for lunch, but when I went to seat her (I was the only server) she said she wanted to sit right next to the window so she could keep an eye on her corvette. RIGHT AWAY I knew she hadn't worked for the money. RIGHT AWAY I knew she came into fast cash. I can't explain it. You just KNOW.\n\nSo she tells me about how she wants to sit RIGHT IN FRONT of her corvette. Cool. Nobody is here, you can sit wherever you want.

And then it begins; the restaurant was Italian. We live in CA so the chef was Mexican. That was a problem. THEN she went on to tell me how she's from Sicily and she KNOWS Italian food and THIS IS NOT ITALIAN FOOD. I had to hear it everytime I passed by to the point that I just stopped. Passing. By. Until they wanted the check. I dropped the check and the corvette bitch paid. Their bill was small, like $80.. But she left me a $5 tip. When I look up I see her cousin standing with the book at the bar. I don't want to deal with her. I ask my manager to deal with her and he said he didn't want to deal with her either and went back after making her stand there for like 10 min. She actually waited!!!

Three weeks before Christmas. \n\nCome January I had a meeting with Bill and Wendy to see if I could get my job back now that they were in. The temporary people had told various lies about why I\u2019d left but Bill and Wendy ignored them, said they wanted the staff who\u2019d been there when they had originally agreed to take on the lease.\n\nWendy said to me that they\u2019d have my back regardless, that good staff were more important than customers. Great, but I\u2019d heard that before.\n\nEarly on (like within two weeks) we had a table of 16. Children and adults. Convoluted order. Kids food came out with the adults starters. One adult man bitched about not getting his main at this time- he wasn\u2019t a child, hadn\u2019t ordered a starter- we assumed he was trying to be funny. Assured him his meal would come out with the rest of the adults meals. \n\nAnd then there was a fuck up in the kitchen and when the mains came out, his didn\u2019t. I apologised profusely, got the kitchen on it, assured him it would be right out. He was rude and bitchy and demanded to see a manager. \n\nSo I sent Wendy who also apologised. He was also rude and bitchy to her. He continued to be rude and bitchy even after his food came out mere minutes later. \n\nThey finished the meal, had desserts etc. No other issues until they got the bill. \n\nThis guy wanted his meal comped. I had previously had the authority to comp (or not) but this isn\u2019t my rodeo anymore. So I get Wendy. \n\nWendy not only refused to comp the meal, she told him why she wouldn\u2019t. \nShe said that while yes, we had made a mistake, we had admitted to it, apologised and rectified it to best of our abilities and yet he had continued to be rude. \n\nShe said, regardless of who is at fault, no one speaks to me or my staff that way.

I was working as banquet captain at a fine dining restaurant, that also does events, in Orange County.\n\nThe event was a large wedding. I'm not going to describe the people in attendance, but I will say that they were not the kind of people that could really afford to eat at the restaurant regularly.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the event there were problems. One of the first people to arrive was the DJ. He seemed nice enough and he told me he was the cousin of the bride and he was doing the gig as a favor. That wasn't the problem. The problem(s) started when another guy showed up with his equipment, and thought that he was going to be the DJ. \n\nWhen I saw him roll in with his stuff I immediately started asking him what he was doing, because I remembered him from other events. It turns out the bride had already booked him months in advance and he had a signed contract for the gig. As I recall, he was due to be paid $500 not including the deposit.\n\nSo, before the event even started the bride got into a screaming match with the DJ because she forgot she booked him. It ended with him screaming \"I have a contract and I'm going to fucking sue you!!!\". Only he didn't say it that nicely.\n\nThe event itself was booked for 100 people, so we had 2 bartenders and 5 servers. That may seem like a weird number for a party that big, but all the booze was cash and carry(guests pay for it themselves). The guests arrived and everything was cruising along fine up until after the ceremony was over and it was time to feed the animals.\n\nAs soon as everyone sits down the whole place starts reeking of weed. this was before it was legal in CA. We can get shut down if the health inspector drops in and the place smells like Burning Man.\n\nThe manager had to tell the bride and groom that we will stop the event if they don't stop with the weed.\n\nMeanwhile, the wedding party is wrecked. They got to drink as much as they want, so shots of fireball and Hennessey. \n\nThe food for the party is three courses. Everyone gets the house salad, which is a basic mixed greens with a vinaigrette. It took almost half an hour to get the salads out, because so many people had to have ranch instead. \n\nWhen it came time for the dinner to be rolled out, it took even longer. So many people had moved we couldn't figure out where the food was supposed to go. Also, tons of meatheads completely changed their minds when they saw the prime rib. \n\n*\"Oh, can get that instead?\"* or even better *\"that's not what I ordered\"*. It was a shit show. We ended up with dozens of extra entrees that we threw in the trash. Also, almost every single prime rib came back because it wasn't well done enough.\n\nWhen it came time for dessert they had an ice cream based item that had to be in the fridge right up until we serve it.\n\nThe fridge broke and all of their ice cream was soup. It was hot summer that year. The broken fridge wasn't on them, but it really added to the misery.\n\nAfter all the drama, I'm ready to just get my guaranteed auto-grat and get out of there. I gave the couple the bill and they immediately want to speak to the manager. \n\nThey had him remove the auto-grat, because they said they were paying in cash and wanted to leave the tip in cash too. I know, that makes no sense.\n\nIt turns out they didn't leave any tip at all. 7 servers and bartenders worked 7 hours for these people and they stiffed us on a $6000+ check.\n\nWe did, however, make $43 each from the cash and carry tips.\n\nThat night I went home and googled the names of the bride and groom. the first thing that came back were mugshots.\n\nTLDR: I got stiffed by some really awful people.\n\nEdit: I noticed there have been a lot of comments about how the manager took off the auto-grat. When he was booking the party, bride and the groom had already told him they were likely not going to leave a tip. CA law doesn't allow you to compel people to tip. It does allow you to add a \"service charge\", but then the employer has to pay tax on that and the company was unwilling to do that. After that event the service manager that did that was told that we don't book parties that don't tip anymore.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675499965.0},{"title":"Employer wants us to start using a \u201csocial credit app\u201d","author":"doyletyree","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10tlq7j\/employer_wants_us_to_start_using_a_social_credit\/","text":"Gagework.com\n\nThis is exactly what it sounds like.

LATER. i wanted it FROZEN.\u201d even though she clearly said either way works. i told her i\u2019m sorry, i literally cannot give her a frozen one. it\u2019s not legal. she then said \u201ci\u2019ve been an original customer of [insert restaurant name here], they always did this for me, go ask your manager since you clearly don\u2019t know.\u201d i rotate into the kitchen, and i already knew the answer so i didn\u2019t bother asking a manager. i come back out and say the same thing i said before. \n\nand of course, i\u2019m still somehow in the wrong here. she says \u201ci know you didn\u2019t ask your manager, that just reflects your service and how i\u2019m going to treat you.\u201d i just walked off, i didnt even say anything back. i grabbed a manager, told them the situation and sent them to her. they said the exact same thing i did. and yet she still argued. we legally cannot give it to her unless it came with directions and expiration date, which it does not. the manager caved in and gave her one, (he really should not have but this lady was NOT backing down). \n\ni come back with the check and she gives me cash. i count it up multiple times to make sure, and she gave me a weird amount of coin change, so i came back with her total change. it was a couple dollars and some coin change back. she looks at it and back up at me. she yells \u201cwhat is this? WHAT IS THIS? i gave you the EXACT coin change so you could give me FOUR DOLLARS BACK. not THREE and whatever THIS is. SEE i gave you 80 cents, which is what the receipt said. you SHOULD NOT be giving me THIS.\u201d  i kept trying to interrupt her by saying i\u2019m sorry, but you only gave me this amount of change. yet she kept talking over me, so i slapped down another dollar (servers don\u2019t have access to the register, we keep our own bank on ourselves) and told her to just keep it because im not arguing over this. and she STILL kept going on about the change. i said just keep it all, have a good day. she handed $2 to me anyways so i dont know why she argued that so wholeheartedly. this was definitely a day that made me want to quit. \n\nif you read this whole thing, i hope someone got a kick out of it lol i just wanted to share this story that both entertains me and pains me at the same time.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675512030.0},{"title":"Anyone shit themselves in your restaurant ?","author":"Ok-Refrigerator-8102","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10tm0aq\/anyone_shit_themselves_in_your_restaurant\/","text":"I've had one elderly man that shit his pants during the 35 years that I've been waiting tables.

I recently got a lot more responsibility at my place of work (bar with food service), to the point where when I'm present I'm usually in charge. And now I'm starting to wonder if some of the shit my coworkers do that just never was my responsibility is bad enough to talk to them about (or run up the flagpole) or not. I genuinely get along well with everyone there and dont want to compromise that, but feel like I now need to be stricter... How would I go about adressing this, if at all? \n\nCouple examples:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoworker #1: Shift lead who has the tendency to stick around and drink after her shift is finished. Insists on \"helping close\" even when she's so drunk she can barely walk straight, putting herself and others at some risk. Most importantly oftentimes tries to get customers out at closing time by being extremely agressive & insulting, and at some point even choked a customer to get her to leave?!! Last part is obviously extremely out of line and multiple people have talked to her about it, but she still feels the need to involve herself in the work after clocking out early against the express wishes of the shift leads actually working.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoworker #2: We're a little touch and go with last calls. Usually shift lead \/ barkeeps make the decision on the fly based on how full it is. This waitress however thinks she knows better, will just do last call way earlier than we decided \/ put through orders after we said to do last call \/ offer a last call even when we said not to, and then tell us that she's been there longer than us (working 1 day a week vs. 5 days a week with prior service experience, lol) so she doesnt need to be told. \n\nSame coworker also has a habit of just fucking off for 5-10 minutes without telling anyone, multiple times a shift. Which would be much less of a problem if she'd inform someone so they can take care of her section, but nope...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd more generally, as half the people here do this: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Coming in barely on time but then spending 10+ minutes upstairs in the staff room \"getting changed\" and ending up 15+ minutes late to actually start working every other day.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Taking breaks together even when it's full. Especially prevalent with the one romantic couple among our staff, but also the smokers really like to all go at the same time, which depending on the day will leave 1-2 people alone for a couple minutes which really blows. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice on whether I should adress this and if yes, how, without seeming overbearing?","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1675520489.0},{"title":"A man just came in with a puppy.

I hope you enjoy it.\n\nWant my section because I make more money. Go ahead I will still make more than you.\n\nThis all happened about 18 years ago. I was a waitress for a Village Inn. I worked the morning shift because it had the most business. Now this is back when smoking was still allowed in restaurants and we had a smoking section and a non smoking section. Our seating chart was designed for this in mind and never changed even after the restaurant went full non smoking. Now on Sunday we had your wonderful church rush that would pack the entire place for hours. So Sunday was totally non smoking until 3pm.\n\nOn the weekends we would have about 8 servers. This ment that smoking side had 2 while the other side had 6. So if you worked the smoking side you had 10 tables to take care of while the other servers had 4. Management knew I was good at what I did and would always put me in the biggest section on Sunday and I could take care of all 10 of the tables no problem. Now servers always talk about their tips and without fail I always made more than anyone else. This caused anger from some of the newer servers and they said it was because I always got the better section.\n\nManagement came to me and told me what was going on that's when we decided on malicious compliance. Ok you can have my section next Sunday I will take this small section. But since I am on the other side of the restaurant I will not be able to help you much. I then got to enjoy a less stressful Sunday did my job like normal turned my tables and made a ton of money. The other server was running around like crazy and not getting much done. At the end of the shift they learned that they made less than the week before because of how bad they were taking care of their tables and the church crowd are horrible if you aren't taking care of them right. \n\nIt was always great to hear the server say you can have your section back I don't want it ever again. Now this was not a 1 time thing this happened many times over the 5 years I worked there. Everytime it happened I still made more money. Everytime we would get a new server complain I just smiled and said go ahead take my section I could use a break.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1675459790.0},{"title":"All-in-One Guide version1 PLEASE GIVE ADVICE!","author":"PermaB","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10tansy\/allinone_guide_version1_please_give_advice\/","text":"**This is the first version of my All-in-One guide! I hope to use feedback from you to improve it for the final version!**  \n\n\nFor clarity sake, the post will be divided up per job in the restaurant, though I believe that learning every part of a restaurant can help out!  \n\n\nI have worked many of these positions myself, but also talked to different people who have worked these positions.  \n\n\n**Host**\n\n* You are the first person that anyone will see in the restaurant! Hosting is genuinely very boring, you have a lot of down time. Be sure to not look bored or annoyed when guests enter the restaurant.\n* Depending on your restaurant, servers will try to take extra tables, change sections or skip rotation. You don't necessarily have to stop this, but it would be a good idea to at least let a manager know what's going on. These actions effect the restaurant or other people in ways neither of you may know.\n* This one may be more personal, but be careful not to \"outwalk\" the customers. Grandma can't walk as fast as you, but you can clear a path for her. Make sure that they can keep up with your pace!\n* Learn all the tables, you'll have to know the numbers. It will take a little bit, don't be afraid to look at the map at the beginning! I try to associate the table numbers with certain things (I can remember 29 is in the corner, then count down from that). \n* Remember to offer a kid's menu and highchair when applicable!\n* Once you start to learn a restaurant's flow, you can realize when a certain server is having problems or isn't noticing a table. It's alright to check if they can handle a table or let them know they were sat!\n\n**Busser**\n\n* Your responsibility is to make sure tables are clean. This job can vary drastically depending on the day, but it's by no means an easy job. You have a little bit of downtime when the restaurant is slow, but as soon as tables get up, your job truly begins!\n* In the majority of restaurants, servers are encouraged to \"pre-bus\" their tables, meaning clear dishes during the meal. Obviously this makes the busser's job a lot easier, but often this is neglected by servers.\n* Personally, when I worked as a busser I would \"blacklist\" certain servers until they helped bus. The servers that notoriously left all their dishes on the table, but this also can cause controversy. It's important to never make guests wait because you don't want to bus a table...*though it could be a different server that gets their table bussed*\n* Be ready to touch gross food, it comes with the job. Don't leave all the food on the plates for dish, scrape it off. Sort the plates if your restaurant does that. Your job is to make sure everyone else's job is as easy as possible!\n\n**Food Runner**\n\n* In my opinion this is the busiest front of house (FoH) job. You are constantly running entrees, salads, soups, bread, drinks, appetizers and desserts. It always comes in waves, so just when you catch your breath, it's time to go again.\n* Help out fellow food runners. If you notice your drink station is going down, but you have downtime on entrees, help them out! When you're in a rough spot, the people you helped out will be there to get you through it.\n* Be sure to run everything in order. There can be exceptions, such as waiting for coffee or tea to brew. In general though, be sure to always run the first ticket in!\n* I've experienced two different restaurants with food runners. The first were paid $12 hourly in addition to a decent tipout. Usually around $20 an hour, the second are grossly underpaid. Servers wages ($3.74 hourly) with tipout only reaching $10-12 an hour. \n* From the above point, know your worth. If you're not being paid enough, speak up and change that.\n\n**Server**\n\n* It can be incredibly busy or mind-numbingly dull. That's the life of a server! Assuming you work in a state with miniscule server wages, your pay relies on tips. This is dependant on getting customers in the door and having them spend money.\n* Choose your restaurant wisely. A cozy family owned diner can be nice, but the math doesn't lead to the same results. If a family of four eats at diner, it could cost them roughly $30, a 20% tip would give you $6. A family of four eating at a fancy steakhouse will cost them roughly $70, a 20% tip would give you $14. \n* Burn and turn, but with patience. Obviously you want to flip tables. Get the old ones out and new ones in, but you don't want to rush people out. I like to offer the bill while also telling them to take their time. It's very contradictory, but usually people tend to \"finish up\" once the bill is mentioned. Often I will make some joke about \"not wanting them to be the waiter on me\" so I should grab it now. \n* Expect what your tables may want. If someone orders fries, offer the sauces that you carry. If they are running low on their drink, offer a replacement. Whenever possible, I want to offer a replacement to a table instead of having them ask me for one. There are obvious exceptions, but it genuinely goes a long way once the tip comes!\n* Kids are the key to families. If you can win over the kids, the parents will love you. Their night is now stress free because the child is happy. They can eat dinner in peace, plus they usually get along with you great as well! \n* Don't be afraid to stand up to people. The amount of ridiculous requests is astounding, but understanding what is reasonable is important. You can't create new dishes, you can't create new discounts, you can't comp already ate food. The list here goes on and on, but in general know when to put your foot down.\n* In relation to this, don't be afraid to get a manager involved. They are there for a reason, so you can get them to deal with the difficult tables. I've told people before \"I'm sorry, I don't have time to handle this, but I'll get X manager right over here to help you out\".\n* Honesty is the best policy...sometimes. It's a delicate balance between honesty and blaming others. Mistakes will happen, sometimes the table gets told the appetizer was burnt and had to be remade, even though I forgot to ring it in. The keg of beer ran out, because the bartender was slammed. Sometimes it's better to own up to what happened, but sometimes it's better to blame it on those not present.\n* Don't overserve your tables. This can be difficult, especially when it's slow, but sometimes people want to eat in peace. They would rather you don't stop by every minute and just want to eat their food. Find ways to pass the time when it's slow\n* Keep track of where all your tables are at in their meal. I've worked with food runners, but it's still important to keep track of your tables. Appetizers, soups\/salads, entrees, desserts and possibly even more. Know what \"stage\" of the meal every table is at to stay ahead of everything!\n* Help out other servers. When you're having trouble, you'll be happy that you did! You don't want to be the person that never runs their own food.\n* Understand what you're capable of handling. Different people can handle different sections, some are good with parties while others are better with couples. Some people can handle 20 tables at once while other can only handle 2. Push yourself, but don't overdo it!\n\n**Bartender**\n\n* Often the prime position within FoH, seasoned servers will often get promoted to Bartender. You may be told to handle tables as well as the bar, but one thing is for certain. You'll be busy!\n* A bartender's job will vary drastically depending on the style of restaurant they work within. In extremely fancy restaurants, this could be in the form of a Sommelier, recommending wine to match meals. In dive bars, you may be everything there is.\n* Bartenders are the most likely person to have \"regulars\". People that come to the restaurant to see them, or ask to be sat with them. Seasoned servers convert to bartenders, pulling their regulars to the bar with them. \n* It's important to stay on top of everything. All the advice from the server category still applies, but you're also in charge of all the drinks. \n* You have to be knowledgeable about all the drinks, to help the customers and your servers. They will come to you with questions and you are expected to have the answer.\n\n**Togo**\n\n* This position is very reliant on the type of restaurant that you work within. I've seen restaurants that have host, busser and togo all in one job, while others have them as three unique jobs. \n* Togo is honestly a simple position. You may be required to put the food together or do some prep work for the next day, but overall it's a simple job. \n* This is not considered a tipped position, meaning you are making hourly wages. You still have the potential to earn tips, but on slow days you will still make hourly wage.\n* Honestly if you are looking to get into a restaurant, a local togo only position is a very good job! You're guaranteed to make at least minumum wage, but often you'll make more than that. In addition you have the opportunity to earn tips!\n\n**Cook**\n\n* Honestly an umbrella category for a lot of Back of House (BoH), the cooks are the ones that, well, cook the food! The job is tough, often cooks are some hard people. It takes a passion for cooking, but it can also be very rewarding!\n* It's your job to make sure that the best food goes out in the fastest time to the customer. You have to know the menu, how to make everything on the menu and also how everything can be modifed on the menu.\n* Food will be brought back. Customers will make complaints that have no logic, but we have to grit our teeth and move on. Medium rare can suddenly become medium well, we can all shake our heads about it, but in the end it's the food they wanted to eat.\n* Keep on top of your stuff. Once you start to go down, it's very hard to come back. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it, but sometimes you won't get it. Stay focused in the stressful situations and focus on getting the next order out.\n\n**Dish**\n\n* I consider this to be my personal worst job in the restaurant. It's very monotonous, while also being stressful and busy. The end of the night is the worst, but the whole day sucks in the dish pit.\n* You're the backbone of the restaurant, there are no glasses, plates, bowls, silverware or anything without you. If it doesn't get washed, it can't get used. You have to make sure everything is ready whenever anyone needs it.\n* You'll get wet, touch a lot of gross food and definitely want some earbuds. It's cleaning dishes for hours on end, but it can pay well!\n\n**Manager**\n\n* Ahhh the Manglers, often the biggest problem in a restaurant. I've left more than one job because of terrible management. It's an important position that's often taken far too seriously by those that hold it.\n* Your job, at the end of the day, is to make sure everything goes smoothly. You should be helping out everyone. FoH and BoH, depending what you're supposed to be covering. If a cook is shouting for help, give them a hand. If a server is crying, handle the problem.\n* There's so many things I could tell managers not to do, because I've had issues with them. The main thing is to be on your staff's side. Back them up and help them out, it's way better in the long run.\n* How you choose to run your restaurant is your own choice, but I've always believed that being friendly is better. Military managers are a thing, those that want everything done perfect or they will blow a fuse, but honestly nobody want to work for those people. Be the manager that others want to work for!\n\n**Owner**\n\n* The \"man on top\" the owner of the restaurant. This is a section that may not apply to a single person that reads this, but I'm still going to give my opinions anyway.\n* Restaurants are run incorrectly, the tipping system is dead. Reddit is a prime example of this, mildlyinfuriating due to autograt tips or similar stories. Tipping relies on the customer appreciating what you did, but also recognizing the tip is necessary and deciding to leave said tip. It's a bad system that's set in place to take advantage of customers by not paying your employees.\n* Obviously a new system would have to be better than simply \"hourly wages\". Servers, especially high-end, know that they will never make as much hourly as they can through tips.\n* My proposal is part-ownership throughout the entire staff. The exact numbers would have to be decided via the size of the restaurant and the staff. Smaller restaurants would give their staff larger percentages, but in the end, everyone would own the restaurant.\n* This comes with risks, if it goes under, nobody will make any money. You don't have an hourly wage to fall back on.\n* I believe this sytem has the potential to increase profits for everyone, but also give people a true passion for their workplace. A reason to care about the customers that come in, because you'll directly earn a piece of what they spend!","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1675501303.0},{"title":"How to be a stronger server","author":"narutox9","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10t2q3e\/how_to_be_a_stronger_server\/","text":"Hey guys I\u2019m trying to be a stronger server to make more money and get put on good sections, do you guys have any advice on this?","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1675477996.0},{"title":"I spilled a drink on a guest today and I'm proud of the way I came back from it.","author":"69Pyrate69","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10s9u9u\/i_spilled_a_drink_on_a_guest_today_and_im_proud\/","text":"I was passing out the drinks for my first table of the day today (a 4 top) when I spilled a beer on the table, which caused some to get on two  of the guests.

Wine glass breaks buy I managed to hold on to the bulb so at least only half the glass spills although the stem does cut my palm.  \nAt this point my adrenalines rushing, I'm exhausted, and I have a full section I need to attend to while trying to take care of my bleeding palm.  I have the manager go and get me bandages and a glove while grab another glass of wine and bring it back to the table with the other hand.\nThe manager gets back to me.  I step out of sight for a minute resolve the issue with my hand and get back asap.  Next move is to grab silverware for a table which I could only find on the patio.  I grab the silverware go to the other end of the patio where there's another entrance\/exit.  I'm still disheveled and trying to get my shit together.  In my haste I didn't realize the sliding glass patio door was closed (it usually isn't but there was a large party out there) and ran face first into the door.  I didn't realize it but I scraped my nose nothing major just a scrape.  Ugh I could have died right then and been fine with it.  Finished the next five hours of the night with no more instances only a few comments from the tables that saw this shit show mostly making sure that I was alright.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675379885.0},{"title":"No ID no service is hard to understand ig","author":"Psychological-Egg209","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10romq5\/no_id_no_service_is_hard_to_understand_ig\/","text":"Just a very common story and interaction I have with customers, one of whom tonight made one of my servers quite upset.\n\nTwo women come in to my bar and read the drinks menu and decide to get some pork belly bites, and then one orders a cocktail.

I\u2019ve been a server for around 7 years now and I have some odd stories under my belt. On mobile so sorry for the poor formatting.\n\nI currently work at a family owned diner that is adjacent to a vintage style motel owned by the same family. The diner and the motel have differing hours, so people who stay there are made aware that they are not guaranteed breakfast from our diner during their stay, depending on the day. When we are open and there are guests, it\u2019s pretty typical the first customers of the morning will be the guests, who usually are very nice people. \n\nWe have outdoor seating only, as our 1950\u2019s steel portable diner only has 11 seats inside, not to mention how absolutely claustrophobic it is in there; we basically use the entire diner as our kitchen which works well for us. Before we got a gate that locked, people would rock up and grab a seat as early as 20 minutes before opening, which forced us to either make people get up from their tables so we could clean them, or be forced to clean around them.  We\u2019d been reprimanded by the health department about allowing customers to sit at dirty tables before opening as it\u2019s a health risk and a liability. \n\nNow, the only people that ever try to sit early are guests from the motel, since they\u2019re already locked inside the outdoor lot with us anyway. I\u2019ve had very little issue letting people know we aren\u2019t open yet and they usually just go back to their room to wait. One day though, a man showed up an HOUR before we were open; the other servers and I had literally just clocked in. He took it upon himself to grab a chair off of the stacks, pull it up to a dirty table that he dusts off, and sits down. I go outside, and the conversation goes something like this:\n\nMe: Hello sir! Sorry but we don\u2019t open until 10 and we need to clean the area before people can sit.\nHim: Oh I know you guys aren\u2019t open yet, I\u2019m just waiting.\nMe: I understand, but unfortunately we cannot have guests in the dining area before it\u2019s clean, it\u2019s a health hazard. There are other spaces to sit not in the dining area if you\u2019d like to wait. \n\nAt this point, this man starts to stand up and wave me off, which I try to act apologetic that I\u2019m asking him to move, before he literally chucks his dad sunglasses at me when he turns to yell at me.\n\nHim: Oh no you don\u2019t have to worry about me! I think it\u2019s extremely rude and unprofessional of you to be running me off like this! I just wanted to grab a table early! \n\nI tried to maintain my professionalism and reiterated that once again, we can get in trouble for allowing that, and there are other places for him to sit to wait that\u2019s not in our dining area. He continues to storm off, mumbling profanities towards me before turning around and shouting at the top of his lungs. \n\nHim: WHO AM I BOTHERING? WHAT AM I BOTHERING? I JUST WANTED TO SIT EARLY AND LISTEN TO MY PODCAST AND YOU CAN\u2019T NOT BE A RUDE BITCH FIRST THING THIS MORNING?\n\nBy this point I am baffled and confused as to why this grown ass man is throwing a tantrum at 9:00 in the am. I look across the lot and see my manager watching the situation closely, but I don\u2019t have it in me to care, so I yell back:\nIM SORRY BUT WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT LETS YOU SIT DOWN AT A NASTY TABLE AN HOUR BEFORE OPENING? IF YOU WANT BREAKFAST YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SORRY ASS SOMEWHERE ELSE! \n\nHe scoffs in shock and very petulantly shouts at me that we\u2019ve permanently lost a customer, to which I respond \u201cthank god! I was afraid I\u2019d have to serve you when we\u2019re ACTUALLY OPEN!\u201d That man turned bright red and literally threw his cellphone at me from a couple feet away before flipping me the bird and storming off. My manager walks over, says she witnessed the whole thing, and that I\u2019m not in trouble, but I will need to explain myself when the owner shows up if the guest decides to complain. \n\nHe never did complain and he actually never came back for his phone. I brought it up to the owner a week later, and he basically said that the guest was living in his car in our parking lot for a week before he decided to offer the man an unbooked room for a low rate out of sympathy. He overstayed his welcome and never paid, and luckily for both of us, we lost an unwanted customer.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675296101.0},{"title":"Applying to a restaurant you\u2019ve never eaten at.","author":"Even_Adhesiveness427","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10rws1v\/applying_to_a_restaurant_youve_never_eaten_at\/","text":"Is this a bad idea?

Till the holidays it was not a problem, but around Christmas and New Year the house was full (38rooms). We worked 3 shifts straight and then a day off. When we had buffet dinner is was easier, but when is was plate service... The guests could choose what they wanted to eat earlier, but it was still a nightmare.. Vicky got her boyfriend to help us out, he prepared the drinks and we took them out, later so the food. Guests arriverd mostly within 30minutes.. So the person whondid the dayshift came for 7AM and worked at least till 10PM.

The best was when I did night shift, but I had to go to work from 6PM to help making everything ready, became a server during the dinner, cleaned everything, washed the glasses, made the tables after everyone went to bed, got up around 5AM, lrepared the breakfast and then went home after 7AM. Sometimes around 8AM and then on my day off went back to help out during dinner..

Well.. I had to train a new girl, but I became sick. After 2PM I told my boss (actually his wife), if that's it, I can't do it anymore. I had fever and welcomed the arriving guest with \"good evening\"... Barely realized..  Boss's wife told me to lay down in a room, I did, slept till 7:30PM, and then went home and didn't move out for 3 days... Fever was gone in 2 days, but then I started to cough, which lasted 2-3 days.

To preface this tale, I've been there nearly 2 years so have a good bit of experience with handling a larger section if need be, our GM knows this, and she's also pretty hands on if it's busy. For being in a town like this one, our team is pretty diverse too, I would say. One of the managers is openly gay, as am I and a few other servers. You'll see why this important soon....\n\nIt was a typical busy Sunday, my section was a couple of tables bigger than some other servers on this day, and I had a section with one of the large top tables in it as well. I noticed a 2 top got sat at a table right outside my section at one point. Two women, I sort of suspect they're lesbians but don't know for sure. They have that kind of 'look' but... Better not to assume.\n\nIt was still morning but I thought at the time all the other servers had arrived so I didn't immediately think of greeting the table. A few minutes passed (maybe 10) and I noticed they still had their menus. So I asked the GM if that was supposed to be my table because she was running the floor helping hosts assign tables and seat. She said yes and that she meant to tell me but forgot, because the server for that section wasn't actually there yet. No problem, I go and greet the table, apologize no one has been there but don't imply they were forgotten or anything of the sort. Basically I act like whoever was supposed to have the table dropped the ball etc.\n\nIt was a pretty normal service for them, got their drink order and food order at the same time, because of course they had decided on everything by then. Kitchen wasn't too slow, brought out their food, checked on them a few times. Normal. At one point they asked a different server if they could get hash browns added which they got quickly because the other server found me and I put them straight in. At the end of the meal I asked if they wanted separate tickets or not. I suspected not (because they're probably a couple) but I've learned not to assume and just ask most times to save myself time.\n\nThey sat there for maybe 15ish more minutes after they were done eating, I checked on them a couple more times to make sure they didn't need boxes or refills or anything. Finally they got up, and I saw them talking to the GM for several minutes. Because I was curious and she's usually fine with telling us what a table possibly complained about, I asked her what they said after they were gone. She said she'd tell me in a minute, and that it was 'weird'. Ooooh boy.\n\nI got a small bit of downtime after a few minutes, and asked her again, and she told me they said I apparently \"didn't want to wait on them because they're gay.\" They grew up in this town and KNOW how gay people are treated and they felt disrespected etc etc. Also tried to claim that I never checked on them even once and on and on.\n\nThe hilarious thing here is my GM knows I'm gay, and that I have a wife, so I can't be discriminating against them... and was also basically standing right by my section the entire time while helping the hosts and saw me checking up on them. She basically laughed at their claims in the end....

The restaurant I work at has an all you can eat deal going on right now, that\u2019s per person, and can\u2019t be shared amongst the table. As well as my management at my company is so company driven they often side with customers just to keep them silent. So we\u2019ll see what happens. \n\nTonight I had a couple come in, before I even finish my greeting she\u2019s talking over me, and ignoring my questions as follows:\n\nMe: \u201cHi guys, welcome i-\u201c \nHer: \u201chi.\u201d \nMe: \u201cCan I get you started with a Pepsi product or a (specialty drink we have that before i even finish saying the name she\u2019s cutting me off)\u201d\nHer:\u201dGet me a fruit punch.\u201d \nMe: \u201cUnfortunately we just have Pepsi products, I don\u2019t have fruit punch\u201d \nHer: *Scoffs* \u201cfine a Mountain Dew with a water\u201d \n\nI knew they were gonna be a difficult table from there. When I turned to him to take his order he asks for a drink on the menu, but grunts and says \u201cI want that\u201d pointing generically at a drink\u2019s direction. It\u2019s alcoholic so I ask for his ID and the man hands me his FOLDED CLOSED WALLET. His full wallet, no joke like I\u2019m supposed to find his ID. I say \u201cmind taking it out for me bud.\u201d \n\nHe then pulls his ID out. I look at it and hand it back. Because he didn\u2019t use any words only gestures I forgot which drink he asked for and asked to confirm \u201cyou want this one not that one right?\u201d And he looks at me like I have 30 heads. And his wife cuts him off and says \u201cthe slushee one and make sure it\u2019s extra slushee\u201d. \n\nI agree and say no problem, I\u2019ll be right back and walk away. I get their drinks and return to the table where they proceeded to both order the all you can eat(AYCE) special we have but we\u2019re out of one of the items. I say \u201cI don\u2019t have any \u2014\u2014 tonight, would you like to take \u2014\u2014\u2014- or \u2014\u2014\u2014 and she rudely says \u201cwell that\u2019s all I want so how am I gonna be compensated?\u201d And I say word for word \u201cunfortunately just those three items are AYCE, I can get you one of those.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo\u201d she cut me off, \u201cI don\u2019t like those\u201d. \n\nThey then start having a conversation between themselves while I\u2019m standing there about what to order next. And in the conversation I hear them planing on ordering one AYCE, splitting it, and then getting other appetizers. Now if you do this, we as servers aren\u2019t supposed to allow you to get more food as it\u2019s not a buffet and I have to ring in and bring every plate to you. Sure do servers follow this rule 1000% across the board everywhere? No way. But I follow my rules because my place is big on the rules, inventory and policy. So trying to be polite I say \u201cjust so you know guys you can order what ever you want but if you do order the AYCE it can\u2019t be shared or you won\u2019t be able to order more.\u201d She gets huffy and rolls hers eyes. \n\nThe wife then try\u2019s to fight it at first by insulting me, and says \u201cahh I see your not one of the cool ones\u201d meaning I\u2019m not someone whose gonna let them slide by. Now sure, if they had been nice, if they hadn\u2019t had the convo in front of me, and if they treated me with respect I probably may have just said fuck it and let them share. But at this point you told me I wasn\u2019t cool, you were rude and condescending and your tone was argumentative before i had even said hello. I also didn\u2019t want to tell them mid meal that I can\u2019t bring them anymore because my manager saw them sharing. After I then say \u201cno, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just letting you know ahead of time\u201d and she then flips her argument to \u201cwell how you know we was gonna share\u201d and I said \u201cyou just said we\u2019ll split it and I just wanted to let you know how it worked\u201d. They rolled their eyes and went back to looking at the menu. She said then \u201cwhy can\u2019t you be a cool one?\u201d And i said \u201csorry it\u2019s just my job on the line and that\u2019s how the promotion works\u201d He tells me they need a minuet and they\u2019ll have a decision in a few. So I said \u201cno problem take your time I\u2019ll be right back\u201d. \n\nI went and got a water for another table and they where gone when I came out of the kitchen. Knowing they walked out, I just said what ever. I knew they were mad at me that I wouldn\u2019t break the rules for them, but I didn\u2019t think there was another issue. She was also very admit about the shrimp being the only thing that she wanted. So I just assumed between not sharing and no shrimp they left. \n\nAs they walked out they walked by another exit to the building and the door had opened while I was ringing in an order, which the computer touches this exit door. They where within ear shot when the door opened and I gave a little wave and said \u201chave a great night guys\u201d honestly not having a second thought about it. \n\n5 mins later someone said there was a disgruntled customer on the phone. My manager took the call, and I sort of knew it was her. \n\nMy manager came out and told me she was \u201cscreaming\u201d on the phone. That I was rude, I \u201csnatched\u201d the ID out of her husbands hand, and threw it back to him. I had an attitude and was very insulting. That I accused them of wanting to share for no reason and that I chased them out of the restaurant (when i waved and said have a great night). Hence why I may get fired. My managers are huge about never \u201cchasing\u201d a customer out. And if i understood why or the full extent of what made her mad I probably wouldn\u2019t have said good night. But, she was so not happy with my manager and I\u2019s handling of the situation she is going to write an email to my store that my area and district managers could see. In the moment it wasn\u2019t a problem, but after I heard her complaints I get it. I\u2019m not saying I was the picture of customer service either. After being cut off a few times I stop the customer service BS, and just reply with yes, no or answers as needed. I understand why she\u2019s mad, though I don\u2019t agree with it i really didn\u2019t even break out of customer service polite. And if I do loose my job because she writes and email it\u2019ll just be so funny to me. \n\n As a server I should have known better that I shouldn\u2019t have said have a good night from the door, it was mostly habit because I try to say it to every table on their way out. So if that is what does make me looks my job, with this CSI then so be it. It will all be weather or not it\u2019s transcribed in her email if i chased her out of the restaurant or not. My managers have a 0 tolerance for that stuff (long history of other servers running after bad tippers and rude customers which in my opinion is something we shouldn\u2019t have a history of but the clients we serve sometimes are absolute awful and I\u2019ve even had the urge to run out and say \u201cwhat was that bull shit\u201d). \n\nI wish I said something better tho, if I do get fired for it.

I've heard of it before but I realized it was on shaky ground and briefly eliminated during the tail end of the Trump admin. Under the Biden administration the rule has been made final however and is currently codified in the FLSA rules. I spent a lot of time researching the law last night (mainly because my employer started going overboard with excessive side work, multiple lists, lots designed to cover the fact we're short staffed on bussers).\n\n\nThe current rule is anyone who is paid a cash wage below minimum wage (ie tip credit is used on their wage) must spend no less than 80% of their hours (calculated weekly) engaged in tip producing work (for servers: talking to tables, making recommendations, taking orders, running food). Up to 20% may be spent doing work directly supporting the tip producing work, and must be relevant to the job (cleaning your tables, sweeping your tables, rolling silverware, restocking, cutting garnish). Anything outside the scope of your role is not permitted (explicitly defined as cleaning bathrooms for servers, preparing food...washing dishes probably falls under this. Cleaning anything kitchen related).  \n\n\nAdditionally, you can't spend more than 30 consecutive minutes doing work in the second category (directly supporting work). This means if you're scheduled to open more than 30 minutes prior to the restaurant being open, you must be paid minimum wage for that time. If you're closing side work takes longer than 30 minutes, you must be paid minimum wage for that time.\n\n\nState laws could vary if your tipped wage is higher than the federal minimum wage. This applies to federal minimum wage laws. However, for example, in Florida, the cash wage is currently $7.98 (higher than federal minimum wage). Despite this, the FLSA rules still apply due to the language in Floridas minimum wage statute. The Florida statute states the tip credit may be claimed for FLSA eligible workers doing qualifying FLSA tip eligible work. So basically the law still ties itself directly to the FLSA. Check your own states minimum wage\/tip credit law wording if your cash wage is higher than the federal minimum wage.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675090876.0},{"title":"Sunday Brunch, Amiright?","author":"CaptainBignuts","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10pg1ze\/sunday_brunch_amiright\/","text":"Saw a post about breakfast buffet and it brought back memories.\n\nBack in the 90's I worked at a pretty cool tex-mex place that had a Sunday brunch from 11-2.

So I already knew they were going to be difficult. (Just not as bad as I even imagined) \n\nThey spent at least 15 to 20 minutes trying to order and wouldn\u2019t let me go check up on my other tables (even though they were clearly not ready to order) and I was slammed busy so I got behind in my rotation. \n\nI finally go put in their order and check up on my other tables. At this point all my other tables are ready to close out so I drop off the checks and then go check up on this difficult group.\n\nWhen I asked if they were doing ok the one lady comes over to me with the menu and points to the Champaign bottle and asks \u201cWhat is this?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m very confused by her question because it clearly states on the menu what kind of Champaign it is and has all the information.\n\n I say \u201cIt\u2019s our only Champaign that we offer.

It was tough work. Hot and physically demanding. If you had a full table, we were expected to carry an entire tray loaded of 10 hot soups and not spill. You kinda have to do deep squat and set it on the edge, and then hand out each from the middle, which is a big reach. So welcome to my day in hell. \n\nBoth incidents happened on the same day, but for brevity, I only submitted the first to the mag. It was for the \"embarrassing stories\" column that readers submit. It makes you feel better as an akward teenager, I guess?\n\nFirst: I have an apron full of pens and forgot I had put some lady supplies in there just in case. Went to grab a pen, and instead, a tampon flips onto the hot grill and starts sizzling. Everyone is just in shock. I run and grab chop sticks, trying to catch it as it pops and sizzles. It caught fire, and chef comes in running with fire extinguisher. Table had to wait 30 mins for another grill to open up. I felt awful. I should have gone home....But I didn't.\n \nToward the end of the day, tired, embarrassed, and defeated, I took a 10 top. Everyone was super nice and cheered me up a bit. I was extra tired because I had been backcountry snowboarding and hiking the day before, and as I eluded to, it was lady time. Here I come with a tray loaded up with 10 piping hot soups. I do a full squat to set it on the grill and fall back as my quads give out. I end up dumping the entire tray  on myself. I had bruises from the bowls and burned my thighs. I ran out crying. A nice lady left me 40 dollars at the hostess stand after the mess was cleaned up.\n\nThe manager expected me to be there the next day, like no big.\n\nFuck that place, so much. \nOther than the tip, I did get a bunch of free schwag from Teen Vogue, so kinda a win?","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675016598.0},{"title":"Weird Door Dash Orders","author":"tanksandthefunkybun","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromYourServer\/comments\/10otbvf\/weird_door_dash_orders\/","text":"We got a woman who every sunday orders $15 dollars worth of side sauces and requests 10 napkins off DD.

They called their reservation in yesterday so we couldn't fit them in the main dining room. We had a popular musician and were booked up. Put them in the Banana room, which is right off to the side. The reservation was at 2 and they started staggering in around 1:30. We set up 4 tables for them and they started doing their thing.\n\n\nThese people--omg. They came in and proceeded to take up the whole room. They had their 4 tables, but they took a 5th to set their cake on and a 6th and 7th to put their bags and their coats. At first it wasn't an issue because we still had seating in the main dining room, but they didn't pay the room fee and we did still need this room for other seating eventually. \n\n\n\nThey had small children and these kids were running all over the place. They were shutting the doors to keep the kids in the room, but whatever--we didn't need that room for other guests at that time.\n\n\n\nI started to take care of them. They ordered all at different times. Got drinks and apps for one table, while another was still deciding on drinks. Then one table ordered entrees and the others didn't want to order yet. People at one table were pointing at someone at another table saying they were on that tab. I figured it out. Good thing I had these people because I'm patient. I did it. It all went smoothly. \n\n\n\nFast forward to the end. I was starting to hand out checks and one of the people at the least difficult table asked me how they tipped. I said idk because they hadn't cashed out yet. So he opted to cash out last.\n\n\n\nI cash them out. I didn't grat them. Chanced it instead of taking 18%. So one table left me $30 on like, $100. Great. Another left $20 on $150. OK whatever. ANOTHER ONE, with 2 kids that didn't sit at the table for 6 I set for them and opted to sit 6 people at a 4-top left me TWO DOLLARS. On $130. I failed to mention that ALL OF THEM had gift cards. Every single one.\n\n\n\nSo I went back to that one guy at the last table and I told him. One was lovely, one okay, one terrible. He told me to give him a number. I said $30 would make it even. So he cashed out. This table was 2 tabs. One left me $30 on their $70 tab. And this guy. He paid his entirely in gift cards and said he'd leave cash.\n\n\n\nHe then proceeded to order another bottle of wine. It was a $20 bottle of wine. Handed me $120 and said keep the change.\n\n\n\nThe kids left a fucking mess. It took me for fucking EVER to clean up this room, since they stuck around and I couldn't pull out the vacuum. I had to scrub the floors at some parts because the kids fucked this floor UP.\n\n\n\nAnd these people stayed. They apologized for the mess, but it wasn't them. They said \"We're not invited back.\" I assured them \"Yes the fuck you are.\"\n\n\n\nHe got another bottle and left 10 more dollars. This party was frustrating, but I'm on the level headed side and was fine with it. That $2 tip would've upset me if this guy wasn't there. It took me so long to clean that fucking room, but he made it worth it. They didn't leave until like, 7 but I give 0 shits.\n\n\n\nTL;DR My nightmare 22 top had an angel with them.\n\n\nEdit: I failed to mention the table with the $2 tip also modified their food like a motherfucker. They were the only ones modifying things. I got things right and had the manager discount one thing because they didn't get sides. They weren't even fussed about the discount but I'm not terrible at my job. Their $120 check was paid with $115 in gift cards and $7 cash.

Now, old me would have referred to this table as, \"a group of assholes\"...but the new me now realizes that people like this are the ones who may truly change the world. \n\nThey finished up their meal, and I dropped off their check. Just like every other table I've ever waited on.\n\nWhat really changed my life was what happened when I picked up their check. My entitled ass picked it up expecting to find a tip...again focused only on money! What was wrong with me?!\n\nAt first it looked like they had left me a $20 bill. Strange, because they did not seem like they were the types to leave a large tip, but $20 would have been 30%! I instantly perked up thinking, again, just about the money...\n\nGuys, it wasn't a $20...it was a fake $20 with a paragraph about the answers Christianity can offer to those who are lost. Can you imagine? I was so happy thinking I had made $20, but what I really gained was so much more valuable. \n\nI can honestly not believe the positive impact this small action has had on me. I no longer go through life with the sense of entitlement I once had, thinking jobs were only about making money. Also, I'm like a super devout Christian now. Like church every Sunday and some Wednesdays. The church pastor says all the time that he has never seen a more devout Christian.
