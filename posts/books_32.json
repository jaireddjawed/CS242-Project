She prefers to listen to audio books so she can listen while working on other things.\n\nOf the following, which would be your preferred method of reading a book. \n\n1.)  Physical copy of a book.  \n\nPros:  Usually accessible, easy to get from libraries, mobile, looks cool on a shelf, fresh book smell, no batteries required.  \n\nCons:  Takes 100% of your focus, difficult to find time, bulky, light source required.  \n\n2.)  E-reader\n\nPros:  Becoming more accessible, libraries are expanding in this area, able to read in the dark, no one knows what you are reading, easy to transport, can carry hundreds of books in the palm of your hand.\n\nCons: Can be expensive, needs to be charged\n\n3.)  Audio Books\n\nPros:  libraries are expanding in this area, very mobile, we all have phones (for the most part), easy to listen to while driving or doing simple tasks.\n\nCons:  limited access, can be expensive, hard to share copies with friends, no fresh book smell.  \n\nI am definitely a number 1, but I get why people read using the other formats.

The manuscript in question was written by a long-time friend. In fact, I encouraged him to write the book in the first place, in 1981. Then I encouraged him to publish it. He found a literary agent in New York who liked the book but who ultimately, after much effort, was unable to place it. \n\nThat’s how it stands now, 40 years later.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11ayuyv/the_blatant_misogyny_of_shaming_readers_of_dark/",
        "text": "I recently read this [article](https://slate.com/culture/2023/02/colleen-hoover-domestic-violence-ends-with-us.html) on Slate criticising the criticism on Colleen Hoover’s It Ends With Us. While I haven’t read the book, I’m familiar with the plot ([wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Ends_with_Us) for plot summary). Some of the points made by the author of this article really resonated with me and wanted to share.\n\n&gt; A dark romance can involve rape by one of the main characters, physical abuse, childhood trauma, serial killers, or countless other types of bad behavior. A book is tagged as “dark romance” more as a content warning than as a mission statement, but the underlying idea is that this is a romance novel where you cannot expect clear-cut morality.\n\n&gt; In the 2020s, the online defense of dark romance largely revolves around the revelation of the personal. On the #darkromance side of TikTok, users share recommendations and salacious screenshots, but you don’t have to scroll for long before coming across an indignant response to finger-wagging moralists, with dark romance TikTokkers saying: I’m a survivor. I’ve been abused. The safety net of a romance novel is how I process my trauma. In a post-xoJane world, it’s so common to publicly unpack trauma, to rip yourself open for internet critics—who never cared about you or your well-being in the first place— that it’s become the first line of defense for readers of dark romance. Dark romance can be healing. See? I’m healing.\n\n&gt; The idea that the primary goal of a romance novel is to be instructional, to set an example for young girls, is rooted in a patronizing and sexist belief that women, particularly young women, are incapable of distinguishing between fiction and reality. Second-wave feminists were critical of romance novels just because they focused on love—implying that, if a romance novel heroine desires romantic love above all else, surely the young reader will do the same. We’ve moved beyond that critique, but we seem to be stuck on the idea that a romance novel isn’t just a category of genre fiction, but that it needs to have moral justification to exist, that we can’t extract themes or feelings or ideas, but we need to be taught how to behave by a romance novel.\n\n&gt; But as someone who loves romance novels, particularly the ones that overlap with elements of horror, I draw a hard line at the claims Hoover is romanticizing abuse. If Hoover’s work, which does not end with the protagonists together, isn’t allowed to depict abuse, you can sure as hell believe detractors don’t think romance novels are allowed to do it either.\n\n&gt; This is something I fully believe we, in romance, should care about. We should be taking better care of each other, we should be leaning into empathy, we should not be forcing fans of romantic fiction to disclose personal trauma to justify their tastes. That, to me, is the real harm.\n\nPlease read the whole article as the author makes a lot of really excellent points. I can’t help but notice this double standard of people being able to enjoy video games or books where killing people is fine, but reading dark romance is somehow perpetuating abuse against women. Data shows majority of women (as high as 62%) enjoy some level of non consensual sexual act fantasy (and psychologists encourage women to enjoy these fantasies safely). But god forbid authors, often women authors, make money selling that content and other women spend money enjoying it. Consenting audiences should be free to produce and consume whatever content they want. If Amazon is allowed to ban any authors publishing books with non con, then they should remove every Call of Duty game and every Jack Reacher novel and every season of Dexter as well.\n\nThis whole idea that romance has to be morally sound and demonstrative of idealised behaviour is trash and should be deemed as objectionable as women being not allowed to read novels in the past centuries as their tender brains were deemed as unable to differentiate between fiction and reality. Data has shown that violent video games don’t make us more violent. Data has shown that women suffering from sexual assault or abuse is not due to them romanticising abuse but rather lack of resources to keep them safe. Given that, why are we still trying to police what types of books we can write or read? Why are we essentially saying women should not be allowed to legitimately, legally and proudly compensate/be compensated for content they enjoy? Why are we saying that an arbitrary group of people ‘know what’s best for us’ because women don’t have brain enough to distinguish between fantasy and reality? Why are we saying they ‘women are confused and repressed’ for enjoying the one of the most common fantasies in a the safe and consenting world of buying and reading a book - and somehow this is not kink shaming??\n\nFor us to say we live in a free and equitable society, we need to stop these double standards and allow everyone to enjoy whatever the hell content they want to. The measure of how free a society is how books are treated. So let people choose, stop the vilifying and stop the infantilising and and stop the morality policing.",

        "text": "A \"*bravura piece*\" is a greatly written part of a book, in which the author tries more or less intentionally to \"show off\" his writing skill. It can be a chapter or a shorter excerpt that is neat, elegant, expressive in such a way that it sticks out of the rest of the book, and can even be appreciated as a whole, autonomously from the rest of the book.\n\nA good example would be the Nose Tirade from french play Cyrano de Bergerac, in which the main character deploys in rhymes every way to mock his own nose. This one scene is so remarkable that the entire play is mainly known through this scene.",

School also kinda messed up my love for books when I was FORCED to read. I have been in this reading slumb for 4 years now, and it sucks. \n\nI might try manga's or comics to help, but it still feels like it will not, because I would have to spend again. And I have a small tbr pile already, and I do not want to increase it.\n\nWhenever I read, I like it. But I never seem tk be able to finish a book. \n\nPlease tell me how you overcame the struggle of a reading slumb. It just feels like pressure to continue reading, which makes the thought of reading even worse.\n\n(P.S. joining a reading community is not for me. The flaunting of reading 4 books a week and the huge 600+ tbr piles are not very encouraging things for me. It makes it feel like a competition between other readers.)",

        "text": "So my question was:\n\n \"**What was again the ending in Robert Sheckley's Immortality, Inc.** \"\n\nAnd that was the answer from ChatGPT:\n\n\" ***Robert Sheckley's \"Immortality, Inc.\" has a plot that twists and turns throughout the story, and the ending is no exception.***\n\n***Spoiler Alert***\n\n***In the end, it is revealed that the protagonist, Thomas Blaine, has been in a virtual reality simulation the entire time. The company offering immortality through transferring a person's consciousness into a new body was actually a front for a company running simulations for wealthy clients.***\n\n***Thomas's consciousness had been transferred to the simulation after he died, and his memories had been altered to make him believe that he had signed up for the immortality program. Throughout the story, he believed he was on a mission to retrieve his original body from a rival company, but in reality, he was just a character in a simulated world.***\n\n***The story ends with Thomas waking up from the simulation and being greeted by the technicians who had been monitoring him. They offer to put him back in the simulation, but Thomas declines and decides to face whatever comes next. The story leaves the reader with the impression that Thomas has accepted the reality of his situation and is ready to move on****.*\"\n\nI was a bit confused that I did not remember it like that, went back to the Audiobook and yeah...that's not the plot/ending. Not even close. So I asked ChatGPT again:\n\n\" **Does Immortality, Inc. by Robert Sheckley end with Thomas and Marie in the hereafter?** \"\n\nthat was his reply:\n\n\" ***No, \"Immortality, Inc.\" by Robert Sheckley does not end with Thomas and Marie in the hereafter. The story concludes with Thomas waking up from the virtual reality simulation he was in and being greeted by the technicians who had been monitoring him.***\n\n***In the simulated world, Thomas had been working with Marie to retrieve his original body, but it is revealed that Marie was just a part of the simulation and not a real person. Thomas had fallen in love with her, but in the end, he realizes that it was all just a construct.***\n\n***The story ends with Thomas declining the offer to return to the simulated world and deciding to face whatever comes next. The reader is left with the impression that Thomas has come to terms with his situation and is ready to move on to whatever lies ahead. There is no mention of Thomas and Marie being in the hereafter***.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI thought maybe there is an issue with the threat I was asking in, so I opened another chat, same question:\n\n \"**Does Immortality, Inc. by Robert Sheckley end with Thomas and Marie in the hereafter?**\" \n\n Answer was:\n\n\"***No, the novel \"Immortality, Inc.\" by Robert Sheckley does not end with Thomas and Marie in the hereafter.***\n\n***In the novel, Thomas Blaine is a wealthy businessman who dies and has his brain cryogenically frozen in the hope of being revived in the future. He is successfully revived 500 years later, but soon realizes that he has been cloned and his memories implanted in the new body of a young man named Benny. Thomas sets out to reclaim his original body and identity, which leads him on a series of adventures and mishaps.***\n\n***Throughout the novel, Thomas becomes romantically involved with a woman named Claire, not Marie. In the end, Thomas is successful in reclaiming his original body and reunites with Claire, who also underwent the same cloning process. They both decide to start a new life together, with the possibility of exploring the vast universe in search of new experiences and knowledge. The ending of the novel leaves the reader with the sense that Thomas and Claire are embarking on a new adventure, rather than being in the hereafter.***\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anybody any idea what the programm is referencing from. The answers are quite intricate. Or is there another Version of the book? I personally found this really fascinating.",

But she’s already struggling mentally with her parents separation and financial issues. She’s always been a straight A student, but now in her last year of high school she’s been caring less about school and giving up on her dream to be a lawyer. It doesn’t help that some of her reads get her even more depressed. I love that she’s a bookie and I want to encourage her reading, but I want her to read something more light hearted or encouraging/motivational. Though I know that it’ll be hard to get her into 500 page philosophical book if she’s sticks to one niche being romance. So I’m hoping others might recommend a easy to follow memoir or inspirational book they’ve enjoyed (preferably under 300pgs I think it’s better to start with something short). You know a book that will get her in the mind set of “My momma ain’t raise no bitch, I can’t let mind get wrapped up in the negatives. I can get through this…I’m my own competition”. \nThank in advance to those who respond!",
