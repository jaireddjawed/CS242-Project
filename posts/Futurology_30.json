It’s harder to paint a picture of what we think the world will evolve to be in the coming years.   That’s what I’m thinking about.   So here goes, please pile on.\n\nWe can stop AI from polluting the internet with ungoverned systems.   Ethical rules are a great idea but which of the major players would ever enforce it?   China, US, Russia, India, Meta?  I think there are too many bad actors or people stuck in political deadlock to expect a UN of AI that would actually make a difference.\n\nTherefore, it’s logical that entrepreneurs will take to the tasks.   What will this look like?\n\nFirst, I think there may be a separation in the internet.  A voluntary one.   One side is the Wild West with crazy stuff, AI and porn of every conceivable kind.   On the other side, islands where none of this is tolerated at all.  A place where kids can roam and morally sensitive people can gather.    The islands will be enforced by AI trained to detect other AI, harmful language, imagery and harassment.    What companies will create these new islands?  Which will train AI to police it?  What will stop people from moving to these islands?   Will religious organizations be the firsts to create an island?\n\nSecond, we’ll certainly want to go to the badlands of the internet for entertainment and thrills, we’ll probably have to for our jobs.   How will we be protected from the AI’s and nasty stuff we don’t want?    I think the personal ether-condom is the answer here.   Possible a VPN-like service where you enter the Internet.   The service is your personal dynamic firewall.   No doubt it’s constructed of some clever AI and blockchain tech.   It service two functions.  One is to only release information about you under tight controls, no leakage of your footprint or identity.   Second, it’s an intelligent filter that blocks what your want blocked.   Porn, zealots, AI generated content, harassment, language.   It’s your personally information defensively layer.   What companies will train and maintain this new tech?   Certainly won’t be the government.\n\nNot many years from now, we choose where we want to live online, and what we want to be exposed to.    This will certainly be a challenge, the creators of this protective tech need to make sure we are also not kept in our own little echo chambers that the current tech is completely failing to achieve.\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "So I recently thought about the things that AI would teach us and how we could advance from them. \nImagine we are apes to the AI, just like apes are to us from the intelligence stand point. \n\nThe smartest apes have an IQ score around 75, we humans only got like 25 more on average. \nThe smartest apes are capable to be self aware, we humans on the other hand are talking about the mutliverse and the fabric of space and time. \nLike, we think that being self aware is so simple, I can't even imagine how dumb the AI thinks we are. \n\nI mean I compared one of the most intelligent animal species with ours, and they think that a banana is like 1/3 of their meaning of life. \n\nImagine AI scaling up to 10.000 IQ, i think if we copare our intelligence here, than we are not even animals haha. \nAI talking to us, would be like us trying to convince a plant that time is an illusion. \n\nI think that this is kind of frightening but amazing at the same time, because everything could be just not like how we think it is. \n\nAnd I think that a lot of experts are trying to make estimates of where this journey will go, but everything that we can possibly imagine is just the beginning in my view. I could be completely wrong about this, but who am I though.. A talking plant in comparison? \n\nWhat do you people think about that? :)",
