        "text": "This may be one for /r/AskHistorians, but this relates to the history of literary reception and theory so I feel like it belongs and is more likely to be well answered here.\n\nI just read Zola's preface to the second edition of *Thérèse Raquin*. There, Zola argues against his critics for judging his novel based on the morals of its content. I feel like I've seen this sentiment expressed quite often. Wilde's preface to the expanded *Picture of Dorian Gray* is a fairly similar text in terms of argument. This struck me as odd as I've always understood the sentiment in 19th century England to be that the French were less critically moralistic.\n\nI know that reception is a complex beast and that the relationship between the arts and 19th century culture was a philosophically complicated one. Still, it feels like an interestingly large percentage of canonized works from the 19th century were poorly received by critics in their own time (For moral, stylistic, or other reasons). I'm not sure that I accept that this is simply because canonized works are in themselves \"edgy\" or defiant of cultural normality. That model seems to linear.\n\nI wonder if my perspective could be made clearer if I had a better idea of specific works that 19th century critics received positively (Though the acclaim need not be unrealistically universal). What were a few of these acclaimed works? What did these works have in common (If anything)? Did acclaim function differently, despite the loose connection I've just made between Zola and Wilde, in England, France, America, etc? Or, did Zola, Wilde, and those like them victimize themselves out of what was not a universally negative reception?\n\nThanks!",

My understanding of Personal Mythology (aka narrative identity - you know, using stories {of family history, personal history, totems, etc.} to situate ourselves in the world) was informed by contemporary philosophical thinkers like Richard Kearney (\"On Stories\"), and James K.A. Smith (He draws heavily from Merleu Ponty). \n\nLong story short, are there *literary critics* who I could reference who talk about personal mythology or narrative identity or any other pertinent strands of thought.\n\nP.S. sorry this was long. first reddit post.",

We have read the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Lysistrata, some Aeschylus, some of Plato's symposium, and are currently reading Ovid's Metamoprhoses. \n\nMy question has to do specifically with the story in Metamoprhoses of hermaphrodite and Salmacis.\n\nWe obviously got the word Hermaphrodite from this story to describe intersexual people, but my professor related to us how stigmatized intersexual people are in our culture, along with homosexuals and transsexuals. And specifically our need, or our perceived need, to group people into two groups: male or female. \n\nHowever, when there are intersexual people being born, and, according to my professor, at a rate higher than cleft palate, we simply cannot (more like \"don't\") group them into a third sex. My professor hypothesized that we feel the need to group a newborn male or female, or assume male or female (when asking new parents about their baby) because we don't even have a pronoun to specify that. You can't say \"it\" or \"he/she\" or \"s/he\" because they are perceived as derogatory toward the person. \n\nMy question basically is this, and excuse my abrasive language: what the fuck? \n\nWhy don't we have a pronoun for this? If the ancients dealt with it (hermaphrodites), and we are dealing with it today at a presumably much higher rate, why have we neglected to generate a pronoun for these intersex people? Is it social stigma? What is the reason? And what would you propose we do in response to this? Is there already a word for this that just isn't well known? \n\nI'm more interested in the \"why isn't there a pronoun for intersex\" than \"what do we call intersex people\" If that clears up my slew of questions. \n\nThanks alot you guys are rockstars.",

We didn't study anything by Georges Bataille, and I've tried to read up on him myself but I'm struggling to know what he's talking about, or what any of the people who talk about him are talking about!\n\n(In general, French theorists are my downfall.)\n\nDoes he mean that violence can't be properly represented through our language systems? For instance, could I disagree with his statement and make the argument that the deadpan, normalcy of the language in *American Psycho* makes the violence seem so much worse than the Nadsat used to depict the violent scenes in *A Clockwork Orange*?\n\nI like the idea of writing about this, but I need to know that it actually properly answers the question, and is relevant to Bataille's quote.\n\nAny help with Georges Bataille at all would be GREATLY appreciated!

Some people tried to project aspects of the author's personal sexual life and history into their fiction, others wanted to read aspects of the author's sexuality from the characters in the story; shades of Freud and Jung sprung up like Scooby Doo ghosts whenever it came to postmortem psychoanalysis or trying to read symbols and metaphors in different works; and there was often a general negative vibe toward any derivative work that took a sexual turn, although that might because of an ingrained sense of prudishness surrounding the source material...sort of like Tolkien in that regard; people expect sex when talking about Nabokov or Henry Miller, but it gets to Lovecraft and people do the mock-shudder and mumble about tentacles.\n\nAnyway. Might point being is that I haven't actually done much work outside the Cthulhu Mythos and its small circle of scholarship, so...how common is this sort of approach? What do you see in the articles and essays you read, and more importantly how do you approach it (if at all) in your own work?",

Death was more likely to find you. Were people fragile enough that added stress could realistically have these types of catastrophic physical results? Or were writers exaggerating this for some other reason?\n\nedit &gt; Got my century wrong. Stupid! 19th century, please.",

As I began considering it, I realized that I hadn't seen much in the way of serious literary theory exploring the way humor works, and I became curious. Looking through my library's catalog, it quickly became clear that there is not a ton on this subject generally--most explorations of \"comedy\" tend toward the theatrical definition. \n\nSo I bring it to you, literary theorists and students: what texts do you find helpful for approaching the comic in literature? I'm open to philosophical explorations as well as more literature-focused work, so whatever seems interesting to you would be worthwhile. I'm not super worried about finding primary comic texts to talk about, but if you have any particularly good ideas I'd happily consider them. \n\nBriefly, I should note that I'm in the process of getting Jan Hokenson's [The Idea of Comedy](http://www.amazon.com/The-Idea-Comedy-History-Critique/dp/0838640966/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413294145&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+idea+of+comedy) as a starting point.

My description below contains spoilers.\n\nIt is set during some sort of rebellion or conflict, and someone who is part of the local resistance group has been captured. Initially, he is waiting with other prisoners, but eventually he is taken to be interrogated. He's told that he'll be released if he gives up the location of the local resistance leader. He refuses to do so, but decides to play for time by giving his captor a false location, I believe in a cemetery outside of town. A while later, the interrogator comes back and tells the prisoner he's being released. He's confused, but as he’s leaving, another prisoner asks him if he’s heard that the local leader had been captured. Turns out this leader had to leave his previous hiding spot and had relocated to … the cemetery outside of town, where he'd been caught. The story ends with the first prisoner laughing uncontrollably.\n\nDoes this ring any bells?\n",

The thing is - I am far from an expert on psychoanalytic criticism, so I need a lot of help! First of all, do you think this is a worthwhile topic to pursue? Secondly, are there any critical essays that could help me? \n\nThanks for your help!",
