        "text": " We are taking a course in uni, and one of the requirements in it is to do a project where you try to invent anything . Our idea is making a machine as follows:\n\n The idea is to design a device to produce compost from fruits infected with fruit flies in a way that prevents them from completing their life cycle or preventing them from going out into the environment so that they do not go out and multiply and cause more infections, and at the same time an organic fertilizer is produced that nourishes plants that can be sold or used on the farm Important device requirements:    \n1) An opening that allows the entry of infected fruits and at the same time prevents the exit of flies  \n 2) Remove the core from the fruit before placing it in the device (or break it up after the fertilizer is in the device    \n3) An opening to remove manure from the bottom of the device without escaping flies    \n4) A way to aerate and stir the contents of the device from the rotten fruits in order to speed up the fermentation process and turn it into fertilizer    \n\n\nI want ideas/ help / or even illustrations on how we will build it , this is the first time I do something like this and it's quite a new experience . Do you think we should try to build it physically or make a 3d design? considering we got about a week and something",

        "text": "The deadline for a research assignment is drawing near, the original idea was to recreate the transparent wood experiment and collect data along the way. Anyway, it all depended on vacuum, which I didn't have access to. Solution I came up with was ordering the water aspirator adapter and just using some fuel pump I had laying around. It came in and after testing it, it didn't produce any significant vacuum. \n\n\nMy 2 options are: 1) salvaging a broken pressure washer(I don't know if the pump is intact) or 2) using an overkill af jacuzzi pump(a dxd315a). \n\nFrom what I've read it depends on the velocity and is limited by the vapor pressure of the liquid, but it's all I've really found. I guess what I'm asking is if going the jacuzzi pump route is even worth it and if I should just risk it with the pressure washer(because the fittings already match up, I wouldn't have to do any janky conversions, and it's a pressure washer, so the water velocity should be quite good). \n\nSide question: Could I use compressed air with a water aspirator? I hadn't explored this idea because I hadn't found any formulas to calculate the vacuum, and the schematic on wikipedia looks slightly different from a standard water aspirator. I have a decent compressor and could work up to the vacuum required doing it in bursts having a valve in the middle of the vacuum line.",

        "text": "My understanding is some/most/almost all (?) engineering programs focus exclusively on 'hard' engineering, or technical aspects of engineering. Are there universities with programs that stand out for including a significant social/ethical component as well? Two aspects come to mind: first, we live in an engineered world, so you might hope engineers don't just know how to DO things (build the bridges), but understand social/ethical dimensions of what they do/how they do it. Second, being a successful engineer, especially at leadership stage, isn't just about technical knowledge, it's about understanding people, systems, negotiation, blah blah blah. Am wondering if there are programs that have a reputation for really developing these dimensions in engineering students.\n\nFor example, Warwick in the UK offers an MSc in Humanitarian Engineering, here:\n\n[https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross\\_fac/iatl/study/humanitarianengineering/](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/iatl/study/humanitarianengineering/)\n\nI don't think that's an accredited program, but if gives you a sense of what I mean. Another example is the Leading Major Programmes MSc at Edinburgh:\n\n[https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&amp;edition=2023&amp;id=994](https://www.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/degrees/index.php?r=site/view&amp;edition=2023&amp;id=994)\n\nI think Cornell has an ethics in engineering institute and presumably does something similar.\n\nI realise there are a ton of specialised courses now on ethics of AI, so while mention of those is welcome, I'm really hoping to find programs (ideally in North America) that are more about soft engineering more generally. The programs could either be non-accredited (typically master's) or accredited but with a noticeable focus on turning out engineers with more than technical abilities.\n\nthanks.",

It seems like I’m approaching maximum pay sooner than I thought and it’s not exactly as high as I would like it to be.\n\nIn addition to that I recently came into a CNC mill and designed a product. Doing this has really shown me that I want to be more on the design side and be a part of the process from the parts conception until the time it is manufactured.\n\nMy question is, where do I start? University is out of the question due to the fact that I own my house and have lived alone since a young age. The only way I could obtain a degree is online, which I am leaning towards the most. Is it possible to obtain an entry level engineering position without a college degree? \n\nI need to get the ball rolling because personally I feel at age 25 I’m running out of time \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for your time and input in advance.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/zb78tb/should_finding_an_engineer_for_a_greenhouse/",
        "text": "Sorry in advance.  This will probably be a bit drawn out and strange.  Also, I'm autistic, so word things weirdly at times.  I've read this over (and re-written it about 5 times now) but feel free to ask me to clarify anything I've written if I just didn't notice that something was off.\n\nNearly 20 years ago I found out how big a problem world hunger is.  To combat it, I made an on-paper greenhouse that will grow any plant-based crop in any climate or season and aimed to make it need as little outside resources as possible (aside from future repairs/replacement equipment).  I wanted to build a prototype with a small farm on the side (to pay the bills, essentially) and once it proved to work make the plans open source while giving them directly to various charities that fundraise to help people in food deserts.  I've been striking out ever since.  The current plan is to try to find someone to partner with who can help me access grant money (as that seems to be one of the many problems for me who barely makes enough money to get to/from work) give them the data, and let them claim the plans as their own.  Hopefully with a contract in place that will make them put at least a few in food deserts, since it was the whole idea.  I've been told by a professor where I work (he does some life coaching) that I should quit looking for ways to fund it first and instead find an engineer to draw up a technical schematic.  He said once I have that in hand, I'll be more likely to find someone who is willing to help.  Essentially it'll look more polished vs. me being some silly little autistic girl who has read too many sci-fi novels (she says after having gotten that exact line before, keeping seeing little ways her ideas are creeping into mainstream ag while also seeing things like demanding people give up traditional diets or make everyone just eat bugs to solve the issue, and the day after seeing an article about scientists planning to find ways to dim the sun. . .).  Does it sound like this should be my next step?\n\nIf so:  I'll get the rude question out of the way first.  How trustworthy is someone I find going to be?  I've had ideas stolen in the past (like the teacher in high school who submitted some of my art as his own in a competition and claimed the prize) and since my pets plus the hope that this'll eventually pan out/pay me enough I can finally support myself are basically all I've got keeping me going at the moment, I'd rather hate to find out that since I don't have the cash to build it right away they \"helped\" me by building it themselves, making a profit, and asking since I wanted to donate the plans anyway, why I am I complaining?\n\nFor the *not* rude questions (I hope?)  What sort of engineer would I need?  It'll have electrical and structural aspects, plus things like plumbing and the floor plan that I'll need to work out.  Where do I even find a place that would do this?  \n\nThe professor suggested I crowdfund the cost of an engineer as I am assuming such a thing will not be. . . well, even within what I make in a year.  Would I be able to get an estimate of what it should take to get the plans sketched up, and if so, how long are those estimates usually good for?  It'd be great if the crowdfunding could do it in a few days, but if it took a few months, would I have to get a new estimate and hope it was the same amount?  Are there any places out there that do this sort of thing pro-bono so long as they get credit when (and again, I've been trying to get this for nearly 20 years.  It might not happen soon or ever.) the system gets built?  \n\nHe said one of the local universities might be interested since they've got a big engineering program and are doing some work with sustainability.  Someone/a few people might be able to use it as a capstone project.  I'd have no issue with that except that I'd ideally like to move from the country I'm living in to start this  (assuming they'll have me.  Also, yes, I've tried where I want to move.  I can find \"once you've got it running, we'll help you expand!\" which. . . isn't what I'm looking for, but is better than here, I suppose.)  If I say that, would they still be likely to look at it seriously, or just say \"beat it, loser\" since I don't want to do it here?\n\nI know to a certain extent how it'd be set up.  I was careful in my original planning to use existing technology that'd just have to be altered for the space vs. coming up with an idea that'd need something 100% new.  (I'm not, for example, suggesting we just build Star Trek-esque transporters to beam the food into peoples' cupboards, despite what most of the people I've spoken to about this seem to think.)  Is saying \"I want this and this, and this thing is based off of this, just on a different scale\" and furnishing a basic sketch going to be seen as me being a rude/overbearing client, or would it likely help whoever was working on it with the schematic?\n\nAnd lastly (I think.)  This is why I was thinking of waiting on the engineer until I had someone to help me find funding.  The system itself should be scalable.  A place with 100,000 people would obviously need more growing capability than a place with 1,000 people.  I figured whatever charity was putting systems out would have an engineer on staff/a firm they'd made a contract with.  For me, though?  I could probably figure out what I'd need for my own table, but I had also wanted to have a tie-in with my business (currently thinking farmhouse cheese with a bit of soapmaking on the side.  The system would grow the soaping oils and perhaps something like fresh herbs for a grocery contract.) and I'd need a business planner in the area to figure out what I'd need for that.  Would I need to have an exact space requirement in mind?  At this point it'd most likely be a semi-educated guess (especially since I've got 2 growing questions that would affect space requirements left), and I'd hate to either seriously underestimate my needs or seriously overestimate and continue to not be able to find anything because of cost requirements for something that would wind up being mostly empty space if it was ever built.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you.  I still want to figure this out, and any ideas anyone has would be very much appreciated.",

        "text": "I'm trying to design a low-tech way to control an induction motor from DC, and my current idea is to have essentially a continuously variable transmission between the motor's output shaft and a rotating element that would either contain:\n\na) a commutator, which would work as an inverter that converts the DC input into square wave AC that'll be fed to the motor.\n\nb) a very small permanent magnet generator, whose output would be used as a signal fed through an amplifier of some kind to modulate the DC input into a sine wave for the motor.\n\nIn both cases, the variator (which I envision as a roller rolling against the side of a disk with the ability to move it along the disk's diameter) allows us to maintain a constant slip ratio between the rotating magnetic field and the rotor, in effect substituting direct speed control with variable torque. I'm aware that this system, as-is, would need some external means of starting. What I'm most interested in at this point is, which would be easier between dealing with the inefficiency of driving an induction motor with a square wave versus that of efficiently amplifying the generator's output. I have not worked with power amplifiers before.\n\nThe end goal here is to find a cheap, DIY way to make salvaged AC motors usable as prime movers for ebikes, go karts, and the like.",

I interviewed with the company and recruiter knowing I have a 3.000 exactly, and was eventually offered. In the offer letter, one of the stipulations is to maintain a 3.000 GPA. With finals next week, I have one class that I may fail because the prof is utterly horrible with super low test averages and a super disorganized class (and i could probably be doing better because a bad grade is almost never all a profs fault, but engineering is hard). Long story short, I have no idea what the curve will be and how hard the final will be. Getting a bad grade in that class would unfortunately drop me below that 3.000. \n\nI have already sent in a transcript and I have no idea if they'll ask for another. Unfortunately, the internship requires relocation and me finding a place to live for 4 months. Final grades don't come out until late December, and the internship starts in mid January, so I need to start looking for housing now. But ill waste a bunch of money if the offer is rescinded. I feel so hosed, with the offer coming in super late and untold stipulations being brought up at the last second. \n\nSo with all of that said, do y'all think my internship will be rescinded if it drops below a 3, or is that just a clause they put in the offer letter if you fail all of your classes so they can get out? Finally, should I bring this up to the recruiter to see if I can get a guarantee that I still have it if my gpa slightly drops? I don't want to try to get an apartment last minute, but I also don't want to have one and then get rescinded.",

The wire diameters and frequency/spacing are the same. My guess is that the springs are manufactured identically and are simply cut to the different lengths, and the ends flattened for installation into shocks. The springs have a nominal internal diameter of 30.4 mm and outer diameter of 50 mm. The spring rate of the springs is 440 kN/m. The shock's eye-to-eye length is 150 mm with a 30 mm stroke and is meant to use an 85 mm long spring. The shorter spring is 65 mm long, meant for a 125 mm shock with an 18 mm stroke. And the longer spring is 95 mm long, meant for a 165 mm shock with a 38 mm stroke. So how would using the 65 or 95 mm springs affect the 150 mm shock, as opposed to the default 85 mm spring?

Was thinking wood slats with strips of rubber tire attached to a cable. Winch the cable to close the clamp at the top and bottom of the tree house. I'd like a safety factor of 2, and to over estimate the weight to 20,000 pounds (5 times more then I expect it to weigh). \n\nI'd like to calculate the amount of friction needed to keep the tree house firmly affixed to the tree. \n\nI would like to calculate the surface required and multiply this by 2 in order to factor in the need to temporarily loosen just a bit for the tree to grow. \n\nI would like to also calculate how much force I need to exert on the winch to maintain the friction I needed. \n\nExample if in theory a 8 inch diameter tree needed 12 inches of the rubber making contact with the tree.

        "text": "Can I prestress a concrete block wall using embedded hooked rebar? I've read [this research note](http://resources.crsi.org/index.cfm/_api/render/file/?method=inline&amp;fileID=268E60EC-A8D0-CCFF-A8248CC279322B35) and waded through 'Structural Engineering and Engineering Materials SM Report No. 125 April 2017' and it doesn't seem unreasonable. \n\nBackground - I'm building an accessory building using cmus. Prestressing cmu walls involves applying compression to the cmus using a bearing plate on the top of the wall and a a tendon anchored to the base of the wall. I know that threaded rods are frequently used (as there are nice washers that will tell you exactly how much force you've applied) but it's also cost prohibitive. If I embed hooked rebar to the appropriate length, apply tensioning via the unembedded portion of rebar, then pour core grout while keeping the rebar under tension, will this lead to similar benefits as traditional prestressed cmu walls? \n\nSecondly, vertical reinforcement is more or less fungible right? If I'm understanding [this example here, they should be](https://ncma.org/resource/post-tensioned-concrete-masonry-wall-design/) - 7.2kips/4ft = 1,800lbs/ft in prestressed forces fulfills code requirements. If (after losses) I end up with  that same 1,800lbs/ft (eg, 2.4kips/1.33ft) then I have a wall with similar properties despite being built differently... right? I have to double check the rest of the variables in the example.\n\nPractical caveats - I'm not sure how to calculate if a piece of #4 rebar bent into an eye hook could hold the tensioning force (~3ksi) without some type of mechanical coupling in the unembedded overlap. \n\nI'm also not certain what (if any) drawbacks would come from doing this in two four foot vertical sections at a time vs a single 8' section; 8' sections means I need a grout cleanout on every pour, but that's not a requirement for &lt;=4'.",

        "text": "Hey gang,\n\nI'd like to critically damp a single line on a circuit I've built.  It's the output of a clock signal generator.  It doesn't \"need\" to be critically damped, but I'd like to learn how to do it and this seems like as good a thing to pick as any.\n\nBased on my initial reading, I need to find the \"natural response\" of the circuit, which requires modeling it as a simple RLC circuit.  I can then do the math to find the natural response, which is the starting point for damping it.\n\nMy problem is that this is not a simple RLC circuit, it's a Pierce-gate oscillator that I've built on a breadboard.  Do I need to actually perform the circuit analysis to get it down to a simple RLC circuit?  I don't want to do that but I will if it's my only option.\n\nIs there a way to use an oscope to figure out the natural response without doing all the circuit analysis?",
