        "text": "I was inspired by an AskReddit post talking about experiences that made you question reality - and I recalled a story that I've always wanted to post here. I remember pretty much all the details, even though this happened almost a year ago.\n\nTo start off, I have two dogs - both sisters, named Frankie and Frieda. Frieda's slightly bigger and louder, while Frankie is timid and fragile. They are completely inseparable, and can't even be in different rooms for minutes before they start searching for one another. They either lay inside a kennel or run outside in the side yard, and the gate is always closed.\n\nOne warm spring morning, I let both of the dogs outside with food and water, and promptly let them back inside. I then go downstairs to play video games - but I mute the television into my session when I swear I can hear the distinct sound of a dog growling. My dogs don't typically growl - they bark, quite often, but never growl - and this growl was almost monstrous. I run upstairs to check it out, and I'm relieved to spot Frieda curled up in the open kennel - but shortly realize that Frankie is nowhere to be found. I check the entire house quickly calling for her, and find no trace of Frankie inside.\n\nI hear the growling again, and realize it's coming from outside. Thinking I may have absentmindedly left Frankie outside, I burst into the side yard. The gate leading to the street is firmly shut - but outside the gate is a pale, white dog, cornering my helpless and limp Frankie. Neither dog is making a sound, and both dogs are staring at me.\n\nSilently and cautiously, I open the gate and move to my dog, calling it to come to me. As I anticipate, Frankie remains completely motionless, and I am forced to pick her up and carry her back inside the gate, through the door, and into my house. I set her back down beside Frieda and my dogs go back to normal. I look out my front door to examine the mysterious dog - it resembles a husky at most, and it has no collar or signs of ownership. It remains on my front lawn, silent and motionless, for around five minutes, before continuing to walk down the street.\n\nThis left me with many questions - how did one dog remain inside the indoors kennel, while another dog remained outside a locked door and a firmly shut gate? I checked with my family members, who were all able to confirm that the gate and door were both firmly shut the last time they checked. My inseparable pair of dogs spontaneously separated, and the culprit was what I can only describe as a spirit dog.\n\nThat's the only anomaly that's ever happened to me - but I still have absolutely no explanation. If anybody has an answer to how something like this could have happened, I'm all ears.",

There was a girl there, who I swore seemed familiar, who was actually rather attractive, though not my usual type (she had long, long curly brown hair and looked somewhat middle-eastern). I heard her name at one point, and later that night I searched her on Facebook. I found her profile, shamelessly stalked for a few minutes, then carried on with my life. A few times since then, I've had passing thoughts about this girl, but never really thought *about* her.\n\nWell anyway, I was mindlessly scrolling through my Instagram feed a few days ago when something caught my eye; it was some run of the mill quote on some background or whatever, but I looked at the name; it was the girl's name, from the acting competition. This made no sense; I didn't remember following this girl, ever. I went to her profile, and sure enough, it said I followed her.\n\nI found this incredibly strange; I'd never even thought about looking for this girl's Instagram; it was just there on my feed. I unfollowed her out of consideration of not being creepy, but I'm still stumped as to how it had said I was following her, even though I'd never even attempted to find her Instagram.",

I asked my mom if we were going to visit my grandfather in the next town over. She wasn't planning on it, but said it was a good idea. For some reason I really wanted to go. \n\nWhen we got there Grandpa was fixing something on his riding lawn mower. He lived in the country. There was two fishing ponds and a wooded area on his property so his lawn mower doubled as transportation when he didn't want to take his truck. \n\nAfter he was done with the repairs he got my brother and I to sit on his lap while he drove the lawn mower around. He pretended that he was about to run into trees and at the last moment he would turn and miss the tree. We were all having a great time.\n\nThe next morning my parents didn't wake me up for school. I walked out of my room to see all our local family sitting at the kitchen table. They were all sad, some had been crying. Grandpa was the only one missing. I knew right away something happened to Grandpa. On his way to work he had a heart attack. His truck turned left and went across a divided highway and hit a tree. They said he was dead before he hit the tree\n\nReally strange that I felt a big need to see grandpa. Even stranger that he was pretending that he was about to run into trees the day before. \n",

First off the Alamo is really small and you can basically see it all in about 30 minutes, us 3 were done with seeing it all and were hanging out by the front waiting on my dad. There were your typical families taking photos in front and we were just watching and sitting on one of the big rocks thats in front. It was like 100 degrees that day and we couldnt wait to get out of the heat. While we were waiting a man in his 60s I would guess was with his grandaughter I presume and walked up and asked my brother if he could take a picture of both of them, he said sure. \n\nI wasnt really paying attention and the guy told us to look at the camera he has, we really didnt think nothing of it and he was showing my brother how the camera worked, I remember I wasnt blown away but I distinctly remember thinking how vibrant and small it was. My cousin asked what kind of camera it was and all he said that they werent out yet. My brother tapped the screen and took a pic. The guy showed us the menu. All 3 of us remember the home button and also that he looked at the pics my brother took, and was pinching the screen and zooming in and out. He thanked us and left. \n\nFast forward to October 2007, Brother, cousin and I are at the house and mom gives dad his birthday present, its the shiny new iphone that had just came out. I was playing with the camera and all of the sudden my brother and I just stare at each other, we both rememberd  the trip to the Alamo and that it worked exactly like the camera he used that day. My cousin also remembered it well, he even remembered how to zoom in the pics and stuff. If you have any questions my brother is here beside me.  ",

        "text": "I've been a long-time lurker to reddit, and I finally created an account just to share this story with this subreddit.\n\n\nWhat transpired took place in the spring of '04. I was an undergraduate student at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana- I use the word student in its loosest possible construction; it might be more appropriate to say that I was registered for classes.  \n\nI was at my apartment, in the midst of a mid-day siesta consisting of multiple Cops re-runs. My best bud Jon gave me a call; he had just wrapped up a lunch shift at Ralph and Kacco's, a local seafood restaurant. He suggested a bowl or two at his apartment. \n\n\"Don't mind if I do!\"\n\nI got to his place in about ten minutes. We broke bread and started to chat. During a pause in the conversation, the question -the question whose sheer audacious serendipity boggles me to this day- popped into my head.\n\n\"You ever watch Martin?\"\n\nJon turned his head slowly and deliberately toward me. He squinted. His mouth made a peculiar smile; it was like he was waiting for an impending punch-line.\n\n\"Martin Lawrence's show, Martin. You ever watch it?\"\n\nJon gave a light chuckle.\n\n\"Why do you ask?\" \n\nNow I was confused. It seemed like an awfully odd reaction to a simple goddamn question. I had no reason for asking. The show just popped into my head, and it seemed like a good bake-sesh question.\n\n\"Tommy, from Martin, was eating at Ralph and Kacco's today. Everybody was making a big deal out of it.\"\n\nWe gave each other incredulous looks as we tried to process what had just happened. I Immediately sought and received confirmation of what Jon said from his girlfriend and co-workers, who confirmed that they had indeed seen \"Tommy\" at the restaurant that day. \n\nWhile the substance of the incident is completely trivial, the probability of the chain of events boggles my mind. \n\nI wasn't a huge \"Martin\" aficionado, and I doubt I had ever had a conversation about the show before this happened. So there's an extremely low probability that I would ever bring the show up in a given day. Combine that with the probability of Tommy from the show \"Martin\" eating at this place in Baton Rouge in a given day. Given that, consider the probability that the person whom I was talking to on the day I bring up \"Martin\" would happen to be working on that day when \"Tommy\" visited the restaurant.\n\nI know this is goofy, but I'm a true skeptic who is nonetheless blown away by this; thought you guys would appreciate it.\n ",

Normally I'm on here asking questions and trying to find more information and help people figure out what really happened. That usually makes me too skeptical to post anything, but I just had to post this, as it just happened and scared the crap out of me.\n\nA few hours ago, I was just sitting doing nothing important when I felt some odd twitches in several places on my body. Specifically, the middle knuckle of my right pinky finger, the right side of my right forarm, and the lower right side of my back were the problem areas. It only went on for under a minute, and it didn't hurt to terribly bad, but I definitely noticed it. I figured it was from playing videogames to much so I decided to get up and go upstairs.\n\nIt took me a while before I decided to come back downstairs. I went to the bathroom, had a bowl of cereal, let the dog out, waited a bit, let him back in, and did a few other random things, and it took me between 1 hour and 1.5 hours. I had a drink in my left hand, and my phone in my right hand, coming down the stairs. I decided not to turn the lights on, since there's no switch downstairs to turn them back off, so I'm descending into pitch blackness. I've done this many times though, so I wasn't bothered by it at all.\n\nThis time, I somehow managed to slip off the bottom step and go sprawling. I think I might have stepped on something... but I have no idea what it was. Regardless, my right hand went flying out, and I fell backwards, slamming my side into a raised part of the floor. And the worst part was, i dumped my drink all over myself and a lot of other stuff. I was definitely more bothered by the mess I had to clean up than my arm or side. I had to turn on all the lights and grab a bunch of towels and move stuff to get to the corners where it splashed. I'm sure I missed some.  \n\nJust when I sat down though, I suddenly realized I had felt the exact same as before, and here's where it got scary. I normally don't have problems with deja-vu and I the idea of experiencing what I did doesn't bother me. Yet, for some reason, I had a panic attack, and I defintiely don't have panic attacks. Nausea, difficulty breathing, claustrophobia, and feeling like I absolutely HAD to leave the room. I grabbed my blanket and ran back upstairs and curled up next to the dog hyperventilating and crying. I don't know how long I was like that, but just as suddenly as it started, I was fine. I don't know enough about panic attacks if that's common, but *that* also scares me. \n\nSo yeah. That happened today. I think I'm fine now. I mean, my ass and my pride hurt a little bit, but other than that...",

My girlfriend always leaves her charger plugged into the wall by her nightstand. Mine travels around the apartment and sometimes I misplace it, causing an uproar when she finds my phone plugged into her charger because of how annoying it is when I lose things.  My point being, there were definitely only two chargers in the apartment till the mysterious happenings of this afternoon.\n\nI had the day off of work and decided to spend it playing games on my PC and flying the new RC helicopter I recently purchased.  The battery charge for the helicopter plugs into a USB port, so I've been using my iPhone charger to charge it.  There is a little indicator light on the battery that goes out when it's fully charge, so while I was playing PC I plugged the charger into the only outlet within view - the outlet by the nightstand that my girlfriend uses.  So, for some reason I completely unplug her charger from the wall and place it on the ground, and then plug mine in with the battery charger attached.  About an hour goes by and I notice that the light has gone off, so I start to get out of my chair when I notice an iPhone charger sitting on the ground under my feet.\n\n\"That's weird.\"  Maybe the cat dragged my girlfriend's over?  I pick it up and place it on my desk, and low and behold my iPhone charger is plugged into the wall and her charger is still sitting on the ground.  There's no way it was there when I sat down for the first time or I would have noticed it.  There are now three iPhone chargers sitting on my desk, and I can't for the life of me tell you where the third one came from.  No one has been in and out of the house all day.  The \"new\" one has a serial number that does not match the other two, and it looks brand new.  \n\n...I think I'll keep this my little secret for when I inevitably loose my original one again.\n\nTLDR: Started the day with two iPhone chargers.

        "text": "I think I have a good one for y'all. \n\nMy Freshman year of High school, my dad gave me a very nice, gold watch as a \"responsibility gift.\" I've loved it, and worn it every day since. I woke up Monday, went through the morning routine, and noticed my watch was not on the nightstand where I usually leave it. Fine, I thought, but I grew more and more dismayed when I couldn't find it in the bathroom, or my dresser. I was upset, but I left the house and just went through the day without it. \n\nUpon returning home, I tore the place apart looking for this watch. I looked everywhere. Pockets, drawers, under the furniture, the consoles in all of the cars, and nothing. No watch. I was mad now, because not only could I not find it, I didn't recall ever taking it off, since there's no reason to. It's waterproof, and I wear it every day. Perturbed, I went to bed. \n\nTuesday passed uneventfully. The weird stuff happened today. \n\nThis morning, I had just gotten out of the locker room shower, gotten dressed, and  was talking to my cross country teammates, just BSing as usual. Wanting to check the time, I looked at my wrist out of habit, and was reminded of the watch. Frustrated, I told my friends how it was missing. Just as I said it, without thinking, I put my hand into my left front pants pocket, and lo and behold, I felt a watch. I pulled it out, and sure enough, it was my watch. I had this look of dumb amazement my friends didn't understand, and I just put it on and made my way out of the locker room. \n\n\nI know for a fact I checked these pants, as I'm rather messy and they were laying in the middle of my bedroom floor. As stated previously, I checked all the pockets I could. The two weird parts were:\n\n1: I didn't feel the watch in my pocket until I told my friends about its disappearance. Then, without thinking, I reached down and pulled it out. I know I didn't feel it before that. \n\n2: Simply the fact I found it the moment I spoke of it's missing status. It was just too weird. \n\n\nIf anyone is interested, I have another weird occurrence that happened this weekend at the mall. Just let me know if there's any interest, and I'll type it up. \n",

My teachers taught me that there's 52 states. I never doubted it, and I always thought it was true.\n\nI asked some people in school today (Germany) how many states the US consist of, and most of them said 52 or 51.

Why does everybody seem to *know* that it's 52 states? Why does my teacher think there's 52 states?\n\nIf it is a simple misunderstanding, I can't explain why it is so widely spread, and why people are extremely sure about it. \n\nIs this a glitch, where people remember a \"different\" branch of the past in which the US has more states?",

        "text": "This has bothered me for years and I’m glad there’s finally a place I discovered where I can hopefully find some affirmation for my experience.  \n\nThe movie Back to the Future 2 came out in 1989 when I was 6 years old.  The movie prominently features Hover Boards (skateboard looking things but with no wheels.  They just floated above the ground using magnets or something).  Around Christmas time after the movie came out I distinctly remember watching a local evening news television broadcast.  There was a reporter and a young boy standing in the toy aisle of a store.  They were talking about the Hoverboards that were being released and were for sale at the store.  I remember the boy standing on the hover board (while it floated a few inches off the ground) and the reporter just talking about how much they cost and the Christmas shopping season and the new toys of 1989.  Later that year I also remember seeing hoverboards for sale at Target.  They were early 90s looking with neon colors and I think they were made by Mattel.  I also remember either reading/hearing/watching some time later that they were pulling the hoverboards from shelves because kids were falling and hurting themselves, breaking bones and whatnot.\n\nYear pass and I decide to Google hover boards.  Turns out, most people say they never existed!  That I dreamed it or something.  But, I didn’t!  I distinctly remember watching that news broadcast!  Also, I eventually met my ex-boyfriend, and he swears that he saw that same show too (we grew up in the same area so it’s possible he saw that same evening news.   He would have been 11 at that time).  He also remembers seeing them in stores.\n\nSome of the theories I’ve come up with have been that this might be similar to the Nelson Mandela effect I’ve been reading about (a bunch of people remember the same thing that never happened).  Or possibly that the toys were actually recalled/seized because the technology was so advanced that someone somewhere decided that the general populace shouldn’t have it for whatever nefarious reason.  \n\nDoes anyone else remember seeing hoverboards on the news or in stores around 1989/1990?  Any theories on why the coverup?  Or was this a glitch in the matrix somehow?\n\nThanks.\n",

By the way, this story is 100% true and not a creepypasta. Here goes:\n\nWhen I was growing up there was a strange guy in my town. He was an albino and looked like he was in his mid-forties. Nobody seemed to know his name and I don't know anybody that had ever spoken to him or heard him speak. He wore the same outfit every time I saw him. Long, black coat (a bit like Silent Bob's), black trousers, brown shoes. He would just walk around all day. He was just always around. I remember seeing him for the first time when I was 5 or 6. I pointed out to my mum how white he was (I'd never seen an albino before). I saw him every time I went into town for 20 years. For 20 years he wore the same outfit and he never seemed to age.\nThe creepiest part: My mum remembers him being around when she was little. My grandparents also remember him being around when they were kids (in the 1930s). He seems to have just always been there. Same age, same outfit for decades. I no longer live in the town but people I know who still do say he's still there now. Hasn't changed a bit. It's strange, the way people talk about him. It's so casual as if it's normal to have a guy in your town who doesn't age, doesn't change his clothes and doesn't speak.",

It had a white glow with red and orange undertones and seemed to have a rotating motion, and it just sat there. I looked at it for a long time in shock, and to my amazement still, eventually decided I must be mistaken, kept taking the trash out and forgot about it until years later. \n\nOn a different occasion; a year ago I was driving on Kanan Rd (a canyon in Malibu) with a friend at 11pm (we we're carpooling from work, neither of us we're under the influence). As we wound through the dark canyon talking and driving when a bright object in the sky caught our attention. We watched a large glowing white object (at a out the height a helicopter would fly but the size of a plane) go across part of the sky and disappear behind a hillside. We watched it for about 15 seconds before it was gone. But it didn't look like a plane, it was a jagged shape of bright white light that looked as though it was crashing. We had no answer so we moved on. I looked for any news of a plane crash the next day and found nothing. ",

Fast forward 2 months and I'm at my friends house and we go to his backyard to smoke some cigars when the familiarity of his pool and backyard hits me. I find the familiar lounge chair and lean back. The rustling of bushes happens and I turn my head not knowing what to expect. It was my friend's dog just staring at me. The dog had walked and then stopped dead in its tracks staring at me in the same position that the statue was in my dreams. I couldn't find words I was in shock. Everything in the world froze and the dog had basically become the statue IRL but then my other friend opened the screen door to bring out some snacks and the dog smelled them and chased the food. Easily one of the most memorable experiences of my life. \n\n\nTL;DR I dreamt about a dog statue that stared at me.

        "text": "A couple of months ago, something very odd happened, and I'd chalked it up to \ninebriation to explain it away, until I discovered this subreddit.\n\nI was visiting my hometown, and my parents were out of town for the weekend.  \nA cousin came over, and I'd probably had 5 beers, which is enough to make\nme sleepy and buzzed, but definitely not drunk to the point of blackout.\n\nWe were playing old vinyl records until about 2am, and then my cousin left to go home, \nleaving me home by myself, just me and Joe Cocker's Greatest Hits album, (1977), playing\non the A-side, which has a run time of 24min, 41seconds (says the internet).\nAt that point I decide to play the first song, 'With A Little Help From My Friends', probably about 3 times in \na row, having to get up and manually move the needle on the record.  It's maybe 2:30am now.\nI decide to let the record go to see what else his 'greatest hits' are.  \n\nI fall asleep, just for a split second. Like when you catch yourself starting to doze off when you're \nin class or driving.  Mind you, I'm sitting on an uncomfortable little footstool, with no way to rest \ncomfortably... I'm pretty positive that had I fell asleep for much time at all, I'd have lost balance and fell off the stool.\n\nI 'wake up', still exactly as buzzed as before, but feeling like something was very very wrong.  I get up to see what\nsong is playing on the record, and it's about 2 songs from the end of the A-side.  Okay, makes sense, that's about\nwhere I'd left off.  Then I realize why I feel so strange.  I look at the clock, and it is 7:30am. \n\nI'd skipped 5 hours.  \n\nThe only explanation is that the record player auto-restarted after playing the record.\nHowever, that turntable does NOT do that.  Ever.  You have to manually place and drop the needle.\nIt does have an auto-retract, or whatever... at the end of the record, the needle picks up and slides back into place, and the turntable stops.  There is NO WAY the thing restarted on its own.  And there is also NO WAY I had been replaying that record for 5 and a half hours, without any memory of doing so.  I'm no lightweight, so 5 beers isn't a big deal. \n\nAny ideas on what happened, or is this a glitch?",

        "text": "Alright. So I was a freshman. I was in the computer lab at my school when I suddenly have a deja-vu moment. I get these all the time. I just go wide-eyed and look around at what is around me. I could have sworn I had seen this all in my subconscious. Some people get this. I asked reddit about it and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98OTsYfTt-c) was the main response, which makes sense.... but not this time.\n\nBack to the story (sorry. got off on a tangent)... I was a freshman and I was taking this career prep course, and today my friends and I were in the computer lab just dicking around, when suddenly my friend put his head against the table. I remembered that. DEJA-VU MOMENT OCCURING. I stop and look around, then something else happened. Another one within it. (A deja-vu moment inside of another.)\n\nSo now it was like I was predicting the future at this point. This happened over a number of *seconds*, mind you, but my brain was running at full speed. I quickly told my friends that I had seen this all before in a dream, and they didn't believe me. I told them, though, what the inner-deja-vu was. It was that I was going to get called out of class for some really, really stupid reason, and they remembered that.\n\nHalf the class later, my friends and I sort of forgot about the whole incident while we were filling out resumes on some crappy website when my strict teacher comes in and asks how many AcaDeca awards our school has. I looked it up on wikipedia and it said 7. He went out and actually counted the awards in the case, and he counted 8. When he came back to tell us this, I replied with what the wikipedia page said.\n\nHe instantly took that as a challenge to his statement, rather than to the wikipedia page. He asked, in a manner that made me not want to challenge him any more, to go count them myself. I just said alright.\n\nSo I went out and counted them. Eight. Alright. Not like I disagreed with him. So I come back to the lab and I reported my findings to this teacher and he just agreed back so we were in this mutual agreement that he was right, even though I didn't even disagree with him in the first place.\n\nSo I got back to my seat, and my friends were just staring at me... Wide-eyed........ I got pulled out of class (which **never** happens)..... For a really, *really* stupid reason.\n\nFrom that point on, I was convinced that there was some sort of thing that lets us tap into time... Glitches....",

His room has a bathroom which his girlfriend was using to shower and had been doing so for awhile. I guess it's not very amazing, but it was a classic horror movie scenario. And we could rule out all factors of human involvement, since no one was in the room when it happened. The other part that was strange was that the volume seemed to get louder from the static or it could have been just a delay in noticing it from playing video games. Also, the roommate was equally perplexed. We both looked at each other like what?? We went in to investigate, but there wasn't really anything to look for.\n\n2. Again, in the apartment. This time I am alone. My desk is in the living room facing the kitchen. I am on my computer. It happened so quickly. I'm not sure if I heard the sound first which is why I looked up from my computer, but as I did, this 4 foot light panel suddenly falls from the ceiling and crashes onto the floor.\n\n3. Mid 2000's. Early high school years. A friend was over at my house. I don't remember why, but later in the evening our whole family goes back to my friends place. We are now just in the computer room, back in those days when it was still somewhat common to have a shared computer. He logs into messenger and we see that I am actually online. Ironically, I was using messenger before we left, but shut down the computer. I'm sure there is some logical explanation for this, but I'm sticking with glitch in the matrix.\n\n",

I had just gotten this awesome [lego spaceship](http://www.1000steine.com/brickset/images/6877-1.jpg) I remember this clearly because I had cut some grass for a week and spent my earnings on a NES system with Super Mario and had my mom take me up to the newley built target to buy a toy. I remember looking down the aisles until I found the one and she asked me, is this what I wanted to spend the last of my money on. Of course I said yes. I spent the night building it then went to school the next day, when I got home I ran right to my room, put the finishing touches on it and started playing. I had these little diecast fighter jets, and with the US being fresh off the ~~Iraqi ass whoopin'~~ Kuwait liberation, my patriotism was high. The lego ship was invading the sovereign Territory of my top bunk and America would not stand for such aggressions. Naturally the ship got shot down. Being made of lego, the explosion would be impressive. So the engines of the ship being the target of an AIM-9 went out and the ship had a crash course right to my wall.\n\nNow the wall I threw the ship at was across from my bed, and behind it was my closet, snug little walk in my brother and I shared. As the ship hit the wall I heard a huge WHOOMP, with a really deep bass to it.. Anyway it did not make the noise a lego ship hitting the wall should make. From the spot the ship hit, my wall, a flat white color rippled. I saw a piece of wing fall off but that was it. Stunned I got down from my bed and ran to the wall to investigate. When I got within arms length the wall shimmered like a reflective metallic coat and then went flat. I touched it and everything but there was nothing. I went into my closet to find the refinements but only found two pieces. Another wing and the lego man. I told my parents but they didnt believe me, and my mom denies ever taking me to target the day before to buy it. She even looked in her purse for the receipt. Nothing. My ship was gone and I had excepted that something weird happened but I didn't know what. The next day in the garage I found the rest of my ship in a corner in pieces. I brought it in to show my mom and puut it on my toy box. When I came back it was gone. That is my first glitch in the matrix.\n\n\ntl;dr Threw lego ship at wall, wall rippled made odd noise ship is gone. Find it in the garage the next day, go to show my mom ship is gone and has been for 20 years.",

So I got up again, and didn't even go to the kitchen this time. I went directly to my room to investigate. I found my pajamas under my covers on the same side of the bed I laid in. I freaked out and then woke back up on the couch watching TV. I was freaking out and I asked my parents if I had gotten up and slept walked, and they said I have just been sitting there staring. I get up again and this time I walk outside and the streets are empty (I lived in the center of town), so I walked back inside and my parents weren't in the house anymore. I went up to my room and laid in my bed to forget it all and then I finally snapped out of it.

Anyway, what some might be considered to king of such parks, an 40' tall, 8 story play palace called Kid's Castle was about 45 minutes away from my house growing up. On the rare occasion that I got to make the trip I spent HOURS crawling around and exploring the endless tunnels in this place. Seriously, there must have been about 200 or more separate passages, all interconnected by slides of varying length, it was freaking paradise for a kid like me. \nA lot of other kids I met there would tell me there were secret passages in the castle, so I spent the majority of my time trying to uncover them. Once, when I was about 10, I think I did find one of these secret passages. It's strange though, the circumstances of my discovery, the place I found, people I met there, and what happened after just don't make any sense...\n\nI made my discover one sunny day on the first floor of the castle. I'd been walking around through the tunnels (the first floor had the highest ceiling) making turn after turn, when I walked into a clearing in the structure. The area was enclosed within the castle but the sun was shining down on the ground into a pit of sorts. The pit had stairs down to its wood chip floor and benches on either side. On the benches were two girls, both staring at me in disbelief. They both looked older than me, maybe like 13 or 14. \"How did you find this place?\" the closest girl asked. I explained I'd just been wandering and found it randomly. She explained back that I wasn't supposed to be able to find the pit, her dad \"built this place,\" and had made the area special for her. She made me pinky swear (a novel idea to me at the time) to never tell anyone about it and asked me to leave. I complied figuring that I could easily find my way back.\n\nI ran out of the castle to find my Mom and tell her what happened (pinky swear be damned). We went back and tried to find it, blanketing the whole first floor, nothing, no trace. The pit just disappeared. I've asked friends of mine who frequent used to frequent the place and they've never seen an area like I described. I've been back there quite a few times since to look for it and not once have I been able to find the pit. It's by far my most perplexing memory of childhood. The place is now shut down for renovations, but here's a pic of what it looked like when I knew it.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7f0fAgI.jpg\n\nTLDR: 10yr old me wanders into a weird pit in a playground, finds two 13ish year old girls who tell me I should have never been able to find it then make me leave. I leave and come back to find it and its gone. Many visits to the park later I still have seen no sign of it.",

        "text": "This is by far the creepiest thing that has ever happened to me. I was just leaving my first class at around 9:45 am when I decided to head to the school library to print out some reading material. There was a fire drill going on that morning and so the whole library was evacuated. After a few minutes everyone was allowed to go in. I choose to go to the 3rd floor computer labs because I was sure the 1st floor would be filled up pretty fast. I sat on a computer somewhat isolated and noticed that it wasn't turned on like the rest of them. I turned it on and waited for the log in screen to show up but it just kept showing a blank screen. After a few seconds the desktop showed up and I thought \"Oh, someone forgot to log off. Let me just log them off and then log in.\" Then it hit me, that I had just booted up this computer so there was no way that was possible. I thought for a second that maybe it logged in using some special \"admin\" setting so I clicked on the start button and there it was at the very top \"Harlequin Rose.\" My jaw dropped to the floor. I stared at the screen not really knowing what was going on. How did it log me on when the last time I had used the Library computers was the night before on the 1st floor??? Does someone have any explanation how this could have happened? I even tried to simulate typing in my username and password, to try and bring back any memory of logging in but I know with 100% certainty that I did not type anything on that keyboard. So I restarted the computer to see if the same thing would happen but this time it took me to the log in screen. WTF!",

        "text": "It started when I was around eight years old. I started having dreams every single night of really normal things. I would be in the kitchen talking to my mom, sorting out my jewelry box in my bedroom, packing up my books for school. These dreams were so mundane and ordinary that I could barely tell they were dreams, it became hard to discern which conversations were real conversations I had while awake, or ones that I simply dreamt of. The one factor that made it easier to tell was *her*. \n\nIn all of these dreams, there was a girl with me. She was the same age as me, she was black, and we were friends. She would follow me around and we would talk to each other, but not around other people. If I was dreaming and in the kitchen talking to my mom, she would be there with me, but I knew my mom couldn't see her. I knew it was only me. In the dream where I sorted my jewelry box, she sat in the corner with her knees tucked into her chest. She was wearing some of my jewelry, and I was looking at her in the reflection of my mirror. It was odd, but I knew we were friends, I knew I cared about her. We never had any deep conversations, we never discovered any striking revelations about ourselves or each other. In fact, I can't remember any of our childish discussions at all. It just seemed normal.\n\nThen the dreams stopped. I wondered why, and it bothered me. I had grown used to knowing that once I fell asleep, she would be there. I looked forward to it. When the dreams stopped, I missed her. I waited for her to show up in some dreams, and she never did. I tried so hard to dream of her again, but I simply couldn't find her. I never told anyone about it, eventually I just let it go completely.\n\nWhen I was 15 years old, I dreamt of a plane crash. I don't recall being on the plane, and I don't remember when the plane went down. I woke up, and there was wreckage everywhere. I was on a mountain side in Palestine, where I was living at the time. The sky was pink and slightly orange, it was so beautiful and I have never seen anything like it. Things were on fire, people were screaming, I saw people pulling bodies out of twisted, burning parts of the aircraft and lifting pieces of metal off of people who were being crushed. I saw a woman with her hands on her head, clutching her red hair and crying. It was too real, I was too aware, I felt like I was awake and I was in shock. I realized that I had been on the place with my mom and my oldest brother, my other older brother and my dad were not there. I looked for them and I found my mom, and I don't remember finding my brother but I know we must have. \n\nAt this point, we are dealing with the aftermath of the crash and trying to figure out what to do. Suddenly, I see her again. She was my age, around 15. She was smiling, wearing a long dusty pink skirt and sandals. She was walking towards me and my heart dropped into my stomach because I knew exactly who she was the instant I saw her. She came towards me and hugged me and asked how I was. I didn't say anything. She took my hand and told us to follow her, she told us she would take us somewhere safe. So we went, and then everything went black.\n\nThen I was in a car. I was in the backseat and she was putting gas in the car. My mom was driving, my oldest brother must have been sitting up front. She told me it was time to go and stuck her head in my window. \"Can you tell me where you're from?\" I asked. \"Ghana,\" she replied, \"good luck.\" Then I woke up. That was it. \n\nTwo weeks after I had this dream, a man came to my house. My parents felt that I had been acting strange, I honestly don't know what the factors were that led them to this conclusion. It wasn't the greatest time in my life and I was going through a lot, but I hadn't done anything to indicate that anything was wrong. My dad had said that he just got weird feelings sometimes. He met a man who expressed interest in coming over to \"check on some things\" and so my dad invited him to our house. \n\nWhen he came through the front door, he didn't give anyone his name and said that he has knowledge of certain things. My two brothers immediately became very angry, and refused to speak to him at all. They said they wanted nothing to do with him, they wanted him out of the house. They both went into their room and shut the door, refusing to come out until he was gone. The man asked to speak to me, and I said no. I felt uneasy too, so I just went into the living room and watched TV. My dad came out and told me it was important that I talk to him, and he begged me to go into the room with him. I decided I had nothing to lose, I might as well see what it's about. \n\nHe sat in front of me and put both hands on my knees, and he squeezed. He had his eyes closed. His mouth twitched.He opened his eyes and looked at me, then went and sat on the couch across from me. \"Have you met a girl in your dreams?\" he asked. \"I've met plenty of people in dreams.\" I replied. \"You know who I mean. I'm talking about the girl you used to dream about a lot, she was the same age as you.\" I didn't say anything. \"Did you just see her again in another dream?\" he asked. \n\nAt this point I didn't know what to say. I had never told anyone about her, and I started shaking. I felt cold, and he wouldn't look at me. \"Yes, I saw her again.\" I replied. \"And she grew up, didn't she?\" he asked. I told him that she had. He asked me to close my eyes and picture her, and I did. He told me to imagine her disappearing. I did. \n\n\"You won't see her again, she doesn't need you anymore and you don't need her.\" I asked him what he meant. \"She is a real person. She doesn't live in your time and you will never meet her in this life, but you both needed each other, and you managed to find each other in another place at just the right time. She came to say goodbye. It was the last time you will meet.\"\n\nI didn't say much, I didn't ask any questions. What could I possibly say? His presence was threatening to everyone in the house except for my dad and I. And it's strange, because we both had the same understanding of things. My dad never discussed this event afterwards, but I sometimes wonder if we're the same when it comes to our dreams. I wondered if the critical, skeptical man I always knew accepted all of this without shock, because maybe something like this has happened to him too. I know that after this happened, my dreams were disrupted for a long time. They were intensely violent and frightening, and one of them was so twisted that it stuck with me for a long time. In the dream, I saw something terrible happen, and months later, I saw my dream on the news. I saw footage of things I had already seen. I wanted to die. I was watching coverage of a horrific accident in another country, thousands of miles away, that I had watched happen months before. \n\nThe things that happened after this are just as disturbing. Other things began making their way into my dreams, and the story that follows this one is an entirely different matter altogether.\n\nI just don't have any answers. I don't know of anyone who has met someone in their dreams, who has been subject to someone who knew about them, someone who could not have possibly known. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I'm 21 now, and I just can't let this go.\n",

        "text": "He did too. It still freaks me out.\n\nOne day I had a feeling that my friend, Eddie, was going to die in a car accident. It was a weird feeling. I have never felt like that before or ever again. A few days later the feeling was growing stronger. I saw Eddie and among our usual chatter he started talking about dying. I never told him about my feeling but asked him how he thought it would happen. He said a car accident. I was speechless and said, \"No man, we're going to grow old and still hang out.\" He nervously chuckled and said that he left a note in his dresser drawer to his dad (they had a rocky relationship) stating that he loved him and really only wanted to get along. I never saw him again - at least not while he was still there.\n\nFast forward a few days. It was a Saturday. I woke up and immediately told my girlfriend (now my wife) that I needed to find Eddie. I had to. Something inside of me screamed that I had to find Eddie. It screamed over and over again. That afternoon I was pacing in my apartment and called everyone I knew and finally found that he was going to a party that night. I didn't get along with the people he was partying with so I never went. The feeling that I needed to see him kept growing stronger but I never acted on it. I didn't sleep well that night.\n\nThe next morning we got a call from his sister. Eddie was ejected from a truck in a drunk driving accident and the truck rolled over him. He was on life support at the hospital. We went to see him. His sister (my wife's best friend to this day) was there crying and begged me to talk to him, to tell him to wake up. I touched him and knew he was never going to wake up.\n\nHis funeral was a week later. His sister asked me to be a pallbearer but I was so shaken I couldn't do it. About two years later his parents found the note in his dresser. I think it brought closure.\n\nThat was 14 years ago. Every time I think about it I get chills.",

I was still sleeping but I had this vision of turning over and seeing my clock at 12:05. I then saw a \"screen\" come up, and it was gritty, like old film reels are, lines, dots, noise, spots, all that. It was white text on faded black background, which I still remember to this day being, \"Your power will now go out, we are sorry for the inconvenience.\"\n\nI snapped awake because of that, it was just so weird and out of place. I rolled over and looked at my clock, which I saw role over from 12:04 to 12:05, which kind of concerned me considering I had just dreamed that. I stared at the clock and then it shut off, as did my ceiling fan and window fan. I was a little kid, and I was absolutely petrified with fear. I didn't move, I barely breathed. I felt like something bad was there, like there something in the room was wrong. I didn't sleep after that.",

When I was a little kid (probably about eight or nine) I was playing at our local swimming pool on my own. There were other people there, plenty of them, but none that I knew. I was not, and still am not, a strong swimmer but being so young I had no fear of testing my limits. After a very short time in the deep end I felt myself becoming very tired and I sunk under the water. I remember this so clearly...My eyes were open (which was a big deal and almost unheard of for me) and I started to sink under the water. I litterally thought to myself \"...Here I go. I am going to die today\" and as I thought this I took in a great big lungfull of water. I sat there for a moment and no pain came, I breathed the water out and took in another heaping breath. Again there was no pain, I Just sat there on the bottom of the pool breathing..like I had done it every day. Eventually I felt rested and swam underwater to the shallow end of the pool where I decided it was probably time to come up. Thats when a little pain came, but not enough to cause a scene. I was facinated with what had occured and eager to try again, so I dipped my head under whater and sharply inhaled the most gruesome and excruciatingly painful breath of water that I have ever had. I came up in a panic and this time did cause a small scene. But to his day I still wonder..if I had never come back up for air would I have been able to breath water for the rest of my life.. was that some fork in the road where the universe gave me an ultimatem and told be to choose between water or air and live with the consequences of my decision?",

This involved vast hours of boredom; waiting to play the next gig, no house to hang out at, reading, avoiding annoying band members, etc.  We had been at a party near Hermosa Beach (LA area) and decided to head out and try some get some sleep.  I could not sleep for one reason or another and just laid in my hand made bunk bed (planks of wood laid across the van seats).  It was hard to relax in the bunks because you would frequently fall onto the person below you or have someone else falling on top of you.  So i was drifting into homesick thoughts, having normal fledgling band doubts....missing my family, my bed, home cooked food.  All of a sudden heard this *cranking* sound out in the distance.  I thought it could have been a tank or another military vehicle.  As the sound approached the van, i began to notice pins and needles sensations all over my body.  The sensation grew stronger and stronger until it over took me and I became paralyzed.  I tried to move, to scream, to talk....nothing worked.  As the sounds and vibrations became stronger, the whole van began to shake and I started sliding off my bed (unable to recover balance).  I was scared to death.  \"This is it,\" I thought to myself.  Then, just as suddenly as the sound approached, it trailed off.  As it trailed away, i regained sensation and the control of my limbs.  My band mate that was with me at the time did not wake up.  I asked him about it in the morning, but he had not idea anything mysterious took place.  I always wonder what i would have seen if i could have propped head up well enough to look out the window.  For now, i'll have to chalk it up to a glitch in the matrix.",

I checked the time on my phone and it said 01:04, and this was the last thing I remember until I realized I was sitting up in bed, with a song from Múm playing in my iPad (I wasn't using my iPad at 01:04) and when I checked the time, it was already 02:02. Almost an hour flew by and I have no recollection of what I did after 01:04. There's no way I could've been asleep since I was reading and laying on my back, and it's physically impossible for me to sleep on my back (long story).\n\nWhat did I do between 01:04 to 02:02? ",

They had one of those stands set up where you can try out the pen on a little legal pad they set out. So I walk over and check it out, and there's one word, in neat cursive, on the notepad, and ink stains all around the edges. There's also all kinds of writing and drawings on the metal around the notepad. My mom sees this as well. So anyway, we look around the isle a bit, and I pass by the paper again. The word in cursive and the inkstains were all gone. The drawings on the metal were still there. No one else had been in the isle, and there was no paper missing. I called my mom over to show her, and she confirmed that there had definitely been writing and inkstains on the paper before.\n\nTLDR; There's some writing on a demo pad in an office supply store, disappears with no paper missing and no one else in the isle.",

They looked at each other and they were both wearing old fashioned clothes. \n\nOff to their right, they saw an indian tribe with a huge fire in the middle of their village. They were beating war drums and painting their faces. Just as the indian tribe noticed the wagon and my grandparents, everything went back to normal. They looked at each other again and they were wearing their normal clothes and were back in the station wagon. Both of my grandparents swear it happened. I have talked to them about it separately on multiple occasions and their stories never change and are congruent with each other. They both refuse to ever drive on that high way again. ",

The drive is not much, about 7-8 miles and I had to cross 2 elevated roads (called flyovers here in India) and take a turn under the third one. It was a route I had been taking for months and could drive back with my eyes shut (if not for traffic). So I cross the first elevated road without incident and eventually get on the second one. As I am getting off this one I realise that I am not where iam supposed to be at all. Infact as I descend from this one I realise that I am at the end of the third flyover, under which is the turn I have to take. I freak for a few seconds before I bring myself together, drive some and take a u-turn from under the fourth flyover and head home.\n\nAt first I thought that I might have gotten distracted and strayed. However, my drive home usually took me 25 minutes and that day also it took 25 minutes in spite of the 10 minutes worth of extra driving because of the detour.\n\nMindfucked!",

When I look back up things are a bit fuzzy, and my friend describes the same feeling. We look at the clock which had previously read 11:17 PM (or something around that time) and instead see it at 12:17 AM. We didn't know what to make of it then, and still don't know what to make of it now. It's like we both either passed out at the same time for an hour, or something really strange took place that night. Either way, it still weirds me out thinking about it.",

I was just peeling my face off the pillow when he looks at me wide-eyed and says, \"Where were you?\" I, of course, say, \"Right here... sleeping... ?\" Apparently, he'd come downstairs (expecting me to be on the couch as I usually am) and couldn't find me. Searched the house, back upstairs, and finally looked outside for me. The couch is in the middle of the room and I wasn't under a blanket/anything that could have hidden me; really no way he could've *not* seen me there. Also, he said he picked a pillow up off of the floor and tossed in onto the couch, but when he came back indoors the pillow was still on the floor where it'd been - not on top of me as it should have been.\n\nTL;DR My SO couldn't find me right out in the open.",

I checked all around that table, on the ground, moved the tv and everything. I checked every room in the house, went back to my room and tore it apart. I basically decided to give up, figuring my brother took it and just as i was leaving... I see it, right on the edge of the table in a nice neat little pile. The chain was in a perfect circle above it, the Buddha was perfectly straight underneath. There is no way i could have missed it, when my mom showed up and i pointed out where i found it her jaw dropped and she has no explanation. The thing is bright green, the table is dark brown..
