PLEASE send me a PM if you have one to add.

With informed consent, you require **no letters from therapists.** You simply attest your gender identity, say that you understand the risks and benefits of hormone therapy, and they begin prescribing and monitoring your hormone levels.\n\nSo... For too long, this information has been scattered around Reddit, Susans place, twitter, various out of date guides from different regional organizations, so...\n\nI laid my eyes on every single clinic website and doctor profile listed in this map. You should be able to call up any of them to confirm, and then start your HRT as soon as possible.\n\nPLEASE let me know if any of these are out of date or if I am missing some.\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/u\/0\/viewer?mid=1DxyOTw8dI8n96BHFF2JVUMK7bXsRKtzA&ll=42.47025816653199%2C-97.03854516744877&z=4","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1568949701.0},{"title":"Is anyone else getting tired of \u201charam\u201d comments on lgbtq and trans friendly posts?","author":"Smooth_Bass9681","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11qdfey\/is_anyone_else_getting_tired_of_haram_comments_on\/","text":"(I know what the word means btw, I come from a Muslim environment)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678722918.0},{"title":"What to do if transphobes are trying to get you deported to a transphobic country","author":"No-Net5676","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11q3tlu\/what_to_do_if_transphobes_are_trying_to_get_you\/","text":"With the unfortunate death of a Saudi trans girl recently whose parents & a firm colluded to force her to return to KSA at the threat of deportation, I want to clear some facts so no one further can be manipulated like she was.\n\nFirst, if you are not a minor and on a visa, it is simply not possible for your parents to do anything about that. Even if your parents were financially sponsoring you & listed on your visa application, once it is approved it can only be revoked if you no longer meet eligibility requirements. Your source of finance can change during your stay.\n\nIn case you are not on a visa & are an undocumented immigrant, your parents might threaten to get you deported. In this case, it is almost guaranteed you are eligible for asylum. Your parents want to deport you because their country is dangerous enough for trans people, it will meet the criteria for asylum. It takes a few years (depending on country) for asylum and until then you can certainly stay in the country.\n\nYou might be worried that you stayed for so long that you are no longer eligible to claim asylum (in the US it's 1 year) & your parents can threaten you with this. However if your parents started going after you after 1 year then it is considered a change in circumstance & you are eligible for asylum even after 1 year.\n\nAll western countries offer asylum because it is based on a UN treaty.\n\nDon't make the mistake of traveling to your parents country ever even if you think they have changed or they made up an emergency. In these countries there is no rule of law and they can do whatever they want to you & you will not be able to leave. If they really care about you they will put enough effort to come and meet you in your country.\n\nAlso, if you are a gulf national, you are eligible for visa-free or visa on arrival entry in many countries. You can escape to many other countries. Airlines will let you board & then if the country doesn't let you in at the border you can say you want asylum. You can do this at denied entry or at revoked visa or permission to stay. They can not deport you until your case is rejected & there is no more appeal left.\n\nWith a good lawyer your case is highly likely to get approved. If you do not have one and can't afford one then government will provide you one for free.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678695168.0},{"title":"Can transgender people be Christian?","author":"colt55628","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11qg2b9\/can_transgender_people_be_christian\/","text":"I\u2019m FtM but I\u2019m also a Christian.

It's not easy to describe how I feel in this moment, but it's a mixture of confused, stressed, relieved, sad, but mostly very tired.\n\nI don't have any regrets about taking the steps I did to transition. It was the right thing to do at the time. I came to the gender clinic that's been following me in 2019; 2021 was when I started HRT. I've learned a lot about myself, and though I don't know where I go from here, I know I'm not just going back to who I was before all of this started. It's been too long and too many things happened. It would be impossible to just \"become cis again\" (and I personally think there are ways to be part of both the cis and trans experiences). I've grown as a person, met people I love, and as I said, I don't regret my decision at the time.\n\nMy reflections have made me rethink how I consider gender as a whole: I used to always think that gender was unchanging and absolute, that if I said I was a trans woman, that meant my gender had always been that from the moment I was born. I'm not so sure anymore. I think mine has changed. It might change again in the future. There's no honest way to describe the last four years of my life as the experience of a cis man, so even if I'm not a trans woman anymore, I think I must have been, at least for some time. I don't think the term cis man applies to me, either, in fact right now I'm not sure what term does apply to me, if any.\n\nI will always continue to support trans rights and the community as a whole. Those who use their detrans experience to hurt other trans people, I have no sympathy for. I would not be who I am today if I wasn't for the community and the people I have met.

I've been questioning my own gender now for 10 years ish and it's only been as of lately that I've really began to accept it. (FYI, I am turning 18 this year.) I know for others it's a relief to come to the realization. But for me? **Pure. fucking. anxiety.** The two first posts that I made on this account confirmed my deepest fear; that I indeed am trans. I was anxious for a full week after I wrote the second post in particular and I was pretty bummed. Fear. All I could feel was fear. Why? Very easily answered: Deep rooted social anxiety and my family. Not only that, with what's going on in the world... I am absolutely fucking terrified and I know you guys are too. Even though I live in a good and friendly country, I still am scared. God knows what family would do to me. I don't even want to think about it.\n\nI've been denial for quite some time and pushed my own desires away in hopes that ''it would simply go away.'' I'd be ''fine'' for a couple of months, but I'd always feel that underlying sadness as I walked around in clothes that I felt didn't fit me quite right. Even though I had gone out of my way to test them before buying them. Then on days I felt worse, I'd just break down and hate my body and identity all together. Now that I've began to accept that fact that I might really be trans... I feel disgust for my body every damn day. In a way it's... *sort* of a relief, because at least I'm not pretending I'm okay, because I'm not.\n\nI have slowly but surely coming out of my shell this year, you could say. I cut my hair short, I keep on wearing baggy clothes to cover up my body and I am very close to telling my teachers to only call me by my last name. I've also told my best friend that my identity is very unclear and that I no longer want to be called by my birthname, which feels good. She accepted it and thanked me for telling her.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons why I've been fighting these feelings so aggressively is because of my family. I look at you guys who have come out and I literally don't understand how you are so brave. My dad's homophobic and I bet he's transphobic too. My mother says she's fine with LGBTQ+ people but she talks about them in a... weird way. She gets a weird look in her eye while she talks about them. My sister asked me what she'd do if I was gay and I heard her replying with: ''\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* would still be my child, it wouldn't be any different.''\n\nIt's not only that which scares me. I have social anxiety and the thought of having to explain to a bunch of people that ''hey, I think I am trans and I want you guys to fix this please'' and then possibly having them reply with ''Oh honey you're not trans.'' it would absolutely kill me. Even if it turns out that I am not trans, I'd still go through with top surgery, Period. It's such a sensitive topic too, goddamnit... Just thinking about it makes me anxious. It's just. God. It's too much. I am so afraid for my future. So how...\n\nHow does one come out? How do I dare to take the first steps to get this shit sorted out?

I began my transition when I was 17 and began HRT when I was 16 a few days before my 17th birthday. I struggled a lot with dysphoria back then but after transitioning a lot of it went away as long as I wasn't sexually active with my boyfriend(Now Fianc\u00e9 of 7 years I may refer to him as my husband in parts of this post). I was lucky enough to be passable and to have a large support group of friends that all cared about me which helped me get through the rest of my jr year.   \n\n\nI'm 25 now and over the years my dysphoria had almost completely disappeared(save sexual situations), I don't go out much due to the extreme social anxiety I have so I didn't really worry about public perception. My husband is a cis-straight male and he sees me for who I am so I never had to worry about other's perception of me I knew who I was and so did he. About 4 years ago we moved out to Maine from Utah away from all of our friends and family.   \n\n\nOver that course of time I've gained A LOT of weight for medical related and poor choice reasons. I recently took notice of it and my dysphoria has been rampaging again. it's brought back all these memories of me wanting to have gotten my surgery by 25, how I used to look and how passable I used to be, how feminine I used to be and the habits I used to have but have broken down over the years and no longer have. I've resolved to get back to my previous image but the dysphoria is so extreme that negative thoughts have popped back into my head including suicide idealization.   \n\n\nI don't feel comfortable talking to my husband about it because we worked so hard to get me out of that headspace and I don't want to disappoint him by revealing that I've sunk back into it and I'm not sure how much advice or help he could give me. He tries his hardest to be supportive of me and my goals but I just don't know what to do with these feelings or thoughts. It's hard for me to continue like this and recently it's been getting worse.

Whether you want to read the whole thing or not, thank you for paying attention to this post either way!\n\nI've been feeling increasingly emotionally numb and apathetic towards people as time passed for as long as I can remember myself, and along with that I've been noticing more and more signs that I am trans. It was difficult to come to this conclusion, since I never really felt dysphoric, but (a lot more than) one too many signs and a couple surprisingly euphoric moments helped me realize this.\n\nHowever, this did not change the fact that I feel mostly numb when it comes to emotions and interactions with people. I feel emotions a little, yet I can't help but think that my ceiling for both positive and negative emotions is much, much lower than that of others.\n\nVideogames... Or, hell, everything that I used to find fun now barely does anything for me, and whenever I try something new, I lose interest insanely quickly. Unfortunately it results in me not being genuinely interested in... pretty much anything. Or at least, not for longer than a couple weeks at best. This often results in extreme procrastinatiom regarding tasks that are actually really important.\n\nI never feel other people's emotions, but I sort of just... understand them and know how I should react and behave. Like I don't really care about people, but not to the point I won't help them. It's like when I choose to be a good person in videogames just because I can, not because I should.\n\nI'm barely worried about things that would normally make others really anxious. This is a bit of a curse, but also a bit of a blessing, since I currently live in Russia, which... Well, I'm sure this says enough and needs no further elaboration.\n\nMost notably, I seem to be almost completely immune to fear, which was absolutely not the case when I was a kid. Jumpscares and creepy atmospheres in videogames and movies do nothing for me, neither does any of the scary stuff in escape rooms. However I still avoid anything that could be harmful and\/or lethal for me, like jaywalking. On this note I should probably add that I am not suicidal whatsoever, and have no issues with self-worth.\n\nAnyway, I'm curious: has anyone here had anhedonia as a part of their dysphoria? Has transitioning helped get rid of it? If so, which parts of it, if any, have been more helpful with that for you? And most importantly, should I try to use (my possible) anhedonia as a shield against the risk of enormous anxiety in spite of the downsides, or is it possibly better to work on tearing it down ASAP after all? Oh, and before you suggest it - me and the therapist I went to concluded that it's unlikely that I have either depression or ADHD, although if this reeeally sounds like depression, I'll go back to her.

Let's call her Sarah.\n\nSarah is in the school's SPED class. We get along well, and I consider us friends. I care for her well being and how others treat her and speak to her. I'm not too sure what she has, but all I know is that it is developmental, so it hinders her speech somewhat, so conversation stays pretty simple. A lot of our conversations consists of her asking me questions, and I will provide her answers.\n\nSarah loves to ask questions. It's all in good intention. She asks frequently about my mom, who used to para her a few years back while she still worked for the school, and asks how she's doing. She asks about my dog, my cat, my siblings, and she asks about my day. She asks me if I'm happy, how I'm doing, what I'm doing, the pretty general, and simple stuff.\n\nSarah doesn't understand that certain questions are not appropriate to ask, even if in her mind it's all in good faith, and I don't blame her because she's just curious and wants to know more. This includes frequent questions about me, my identity, my name, and whether I'm a boy or girl.\n\nI began my transition after knowing Sarah, so she was aware of my journey pretty much since the very beginning, and knew me very well before I started it. She was very quick to use my name and different pronouns. I'm five years into my transition now, a year and a half on T,  and occasionally she will ask me questions that make me pretty uncomfortable. Some of these include:\n\n\"Connor are you a boy?\"\n\"You're not a girl?\"\n\"You were a girl in 2016?\"\n\"You're name is Connor, not * deadname * ?\"\n\"Why are you a boy?\"\n\nI have spoken to my first hour teacher and the SPED teacher about talking to her about asking these questions, and for the most part they aren't asked as often anymore, but they still come up. When they do, I've just kind of began telling her that I have \"never been a girl\", and that \"I have always been a boy.\" When she asks me about my deadname I tell her that I was never deadname, and that I have always been Connor. In a way, I am not lying to her.\n\nKeep in mind that due to her disability, this isn't as simple as trying to explain what transgender means, she won't understand (I have made an attempt before). But at the same time I feel guilty for essentially gaslighting her about memories she has of me prior to my transition. \n\nWhat do I do?","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678726251.0},{"title":"Saw this on a deluded JP fan page, responses?","author":"Smooth_Bass9681","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11q287e\/saw_this_on_a_deluded_jp_fan_page_responses\/","text":"*TW: Transphobia*\n\nThis was response to a claim saying, men (all men) can\u2019t get pregnant\n\n\u201cThe words \"woman\" and \"man\" were words we humans invented to describe what we saw.

For the context, I'm AMAB. I was just having yet another gender crisis, as you may call it. It's more like a years prolonged crisis honestly. I can't stop thinking about the question if I'm trans or not. Continuously this question is on my mind. It's almost comical if it didn't drive me crazy. \n\nI always keep thinking if x makes me trans or if y doesn't make me trans and I cannot find the answer for the life of me. And the other thing is, I'm not too sure being this fixated on gender is dysphoria itself or not.\nThe reason I'm so caught up about this is because, well obviously this is a crucial aspect to a person's life. And the later you actually come to any conclusions, the less your chances are at actually passing. The more masculine your body grows.\n\nAnd sure I'm past puberty but the longer I wait the more likely is it that its mark will be permanent, I'm 19 and I suppose my body keeps changing and growing until early 20's. And I'm not sure if I'd want that or not. \n\nSometimes I wish I would have been born a woman. Like a cis woman. I tend to compare myself to every woman I see and recognize how taller I am, my shoulders are broad, my feet are too big, male pattern baldness will inevitably come to me, I have a male skull, etc. \nIf I wanted to pass as a woman, I'd have to compensate for everything I mentioned. \n\nI don't know if I could benefit from transition or not. Or if it is even right for me. I think about starting hormones and I feel like I just.. what if I regret it? What if I regret transitioning as a whole and I didn't need it all along?\n\nI don't like to call myself a woman honestly. It only makes me angsty. Or wearing a dress. Or make up. They just feel very uncommon, especially if the sole reason I'm doing it is to feel a shred of femininity because it's not within me. \n\nI do feel like I'll never be a woman. It's kind of a fact set in stone for me. It's like I've been marked as a man after my birth. I just feel unsettled even imagining myself as a woman. \n\nBut I don't know if that's because I'm dysphoric or I'm just a man and I don't like to be a woman. Thoughts about gender dominate my mind. And I have no idea what's right and what's not. I'm just always thinking about this, am I x or am I y, should I do this or should I not, etc. \n\nI'm sort of at a loss. I mean I know that the right thing to do is to go through your life and eventually you'll realize what you want. But I fear I'd let it go for far too long and eventually it hits me when my body is a complete adult male. I wouldn't want to think about transitioning when I'm a manly man, that just sounds horrifying to me. \n\nI don't take pictures of myself. I often don't like to speak out loud. I don't like to be perceived. But that could also be because of depression.\n\nI just have no idea if transitioning has bearing to me being more comfortable, content and happy or am I just thinking about this too much \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678722386.0},{"title":"taking hrts to florida?","author":"Darkn3ssisland","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11qcxak\/taking_hrts_to_florida\/","text":"so next Christmas my dad wants to bring me and my siblings down to Florida for the holiday and I was wondering if anyone had any idea or have any resources for me to figure out if there would be any legal repercussions that could occur from me bringing my meds down with me.

I miss and feel like a part of me is missing with my gender roles, and really, this expands more into the social connections piece, like I miss connecting with guys and a guy-to-guy connection. So in simple terms now, I am happy with my sex but struggling with my gender. \n\nFirst, I am not looking for advice, mostly just curious if others can relate.

As in my previous posts I apologize for my English, my language is Spanish, so I use a translator for some things...\nThis is my third post, and it's for advice!  I would very much love to read advice from people who have had an IP and scrotal skin SRS done. It is the method that they performed on me and I would be very grateful to read successful cases that have been with their neovagina for years.  My problem is that I can't love my vagina and I would like to overcome that, obviously I prefer my neovagina instead of the above, but I am very depressed with the functional result, I don't like it, every day I find a defect and from time to time a problem arises that worsens the situation.  My first problem was that the hair grew back and grew inside, it's a lot of hair so it's crap that I can't get out... The next one was realizing that I need a daily douche because of the horrible smell... Then my problem with sexual intercourse!  the irritation and the exaggerated need for lubricant... Then I realized that my skin wrinkles inside and I find it disgusting, I thought that being stretched, it was smooth skin, but it's wrinkled, rough, I hate it.\n Finally to top it all off, even though I dilate, I'm still very tight, so tight that it's hard for me to have sex.\n All of this has caused me to have depression, it's been a year and a half since my surgery and I can't imagine enduring this all my life, what's wrong with me???  Am I being exaggerated or have I developed dysphoria again, is that possible?  I don't know, but I want to emphasize that before the problems I was very happy, the first months I was living a dream, now every day I have a vaginal concern on my mind, it's horrible...\n My intention is not to scare anyone, I know that there are very good surgeons with excellent results, I don't blame my surgeon either, he is a professional person with prestige, I don't blame anyone but I feel that my body went wrong, I know there are worse things I know, but it's depressing to have lived such a sad life to be happy for a few months and start with problems again, I'll be sick in the head or my feeling is understandable with all this.\n First of all, it was my fault!  I did not want to investigate deeply, I was happy to be able to perform the surgery and I chose this technique because it is the most recommended, I only investigated what was necessary, also in my country they only do this technique, I even thought that my laser hair removal would be enough, but I did not know what a hormonal problem would activate the follicles again, then the hair came back I also didn't imagine that I would smell bad despite the showers and the metrogel, also, due to the large number of girls who can have sex without problems, I never thought it would be so difficult for my...\n With my ex-partner we couldn't have unprotected sex because the skin rose hurt him, we couldn't with a condom either because I'm very tight and it's uncomfortable.  Unfortunately sex is important in a relationship, let's be real, therefore we ended everything... Ok, there were other problems but my vagina was a point against.\n When I have casual encounters, I end up having anal sex because I squeeze a lot, even though I use lubricant, it dries quickly and I am very worried about my internal hairs, I am also disgusted by keeping bacteria inside.\n Well, not everything is negative, I must say that my masturbation orgasms are very good, my aesthetics are beautiful, the lips are beautiful, the clitoris is beautiful and the sensation is also beautiful, although at the beginning of the neovagina tunnel, there is something that makes it very clear that the skin is from the scrotum and that causes me dysphoria, it reminds me of my testicles, I am also very worried about what will happen in the future with my neovagina and about the hairs.\nThe worst part is how this situation has affected me, I have had suicidal and transphobic thoughts, for example I have come to think that I only have a hole that accumulates bacteria and a bad smell, so I feel like crying or when I have sex I don't like to be touched there because the classic insult that I have read many times that I have a mutilated penis, a mutilated penis rubbing against another penis comes to mind... it sounds horrible, I had never thought like that, but it gets into my head and does not allow me to enjoy.\n I have told my surgeon about the functional problems and his solutions are short-term for a while, so I got bored...\n It's official, I have to undergo a revision surgery but at this moment I don't have money, I have to put it together and obviously I have to do the srs in another country because in my country there are almost no other options than PI and much less to correct.\n I hope I'm not bothering or scaring with all this, but I have nowhere to vent, I can't talk about it with my friends because they'll say I'm exaggerating, I can't talk about it with my family because it embarrasses me and I don't want to seem negative either, there are people who go through worse things, So I'm not the one to talk about suffering.\n I didn't want to do this post but I'm very sad and I want to get it out of my mind... Sometimes, I read things on Reddit and I get much more depressed, I don't want to give space to transphobic people because they would be happy to read my situation and that makes me bothers too much.  I also don't want to be attacked by people from the community who are satisfied with their results, but when I read the false expectations about srs on Reddit, I feel identified... There are impossible things!  For example, there is no internal humidity, it is sweat and traces of lubricant from the dilations, the fluid that appears during arousal comes from the prostate, in my case it is little and is expelled during orgasm, the skin of the neovagina never becomes in internal skin, it is external skin that must be cared for and cleaned a lot, in my case the dilations never end, if I stop, this will make me tighter.  My surgeon never gave me false illusions, he is a realist, therefore a surgeon who denies this reality or invents miracles cannot be trusted.  My problem is that at that moment I didn't see further, I only knew the PI method (which is done in my country) and the colon method (they don't do it in my country) I was afraid to investigate about the surgery and scare myself because it is very difficult and complex, so I didn't see videos, I didn't see results either, I didn't read about cases, I didn't know there were other options and I didn't want to know about the complications either, my surgeon informed me just and necessary, although he's a good surgeon everyone adorns things showing off their good cases, I thought it would be one of those so I didn't want to be scared. Besides, on the internet there are a lot of transphobic people giving away false information and scaring people, so I didn't want to go down that path.\n Lastly, the skin doesn't feel like a cis vagina but with lube it feels smooth although the difference and wrinkled feel is noticeable.\n It is for all this and for all that I feel, that I regret having chosen this method, I should have raised more money to travel to another country and choose the ppt or colon method, so as personal advice, do your research and be realistic .  Well, if anyone has any advice to be able to overcome all this, to learn to live with this, to not be sad, I would really appreciate it because it will take me a while to be able to undergo a revision srs.  I insist, I am not sorry about the surgery, I am sorry about the method.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678601007.0},{"title":"After you began to identify as trans, did you find that the roles in your sexual experiences\/desires inverted from when you still identified as the gender that was assigned to you at birth?","author":"LafilduPoseidon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11pylb2\/after_you_began_to_identify_as_trans_did_you_find\/","text":"I have only recently began to identify as trans and have found that since then, without going into too much detail, is it common for trans individuals who, for example, preferred to behave submissively during sex before identifying as trans, to suddenly prefer to not only behave more dominantly but to have the same sexual fantasies as before but with the roles 180\u2019d?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678677402.0},{"title":"FTM here, does working out and losing weight make your chest smaller, or more prominent?","author":"mangledwoods","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11ppjzo\/ftm_here_does_working_out_and_losing_weight_make\/","text":"I\u2019m trying to work out more and feel more positive about my body and I\u2019m hoping that it might make my chest smaller, but I\u2019m also scared that it might make it prominent.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678654469.0},{"title":"My child reacted negatively to HRT.

Last August, we came to a point where HRT was a recommended option. I came to every visit and consultation and me and my child spoke extensively about it, including the possible side-effects.\n\nThey have been on it since late September. In mid November, they began experiencing something I can only describe as episodes of rage. It almost always begins the next day after their injection and lasts about 4-6 days, in which my child is argumentative, aggressive, withdrawn, very easily annoyed by their younger sibling. They slapped their sibling after their last injection and while they looked horrified about it, they seemed unable to stop their own outburst and ended up staying with their friend for 2 days until they got kicked out of there for rude behaviour (friend's parents called me).\n\nWe have had an ongoing dialogue about this since the New Year's, and I have spoken to their doctor in February. Neither my child nor the doctor consider stopping. My child reacts very negatively to any implication it does more harm than good and my child's doctor says that it's an adjustment period and testosterone just makes people impulsive. I asked about how long this will go on and the doctor stated that it's different for everyone. My child refuses to change doctors as well.\n\nMy child went through puberty at 12 and even when they were actively \"hormonal\", they never exhibited such behaviours.

I just want to get this stuff off my chest, and hopefully get some other insights from you people.\n\nCW: one mention of unaliving and related thoughts.\n\nAbout five months ago, I started questioning my gender, and I woke up just thinking that I didn't want to be a man anymore. For the past thirteen years (slightly over half my life), I had some inexplicable attraction towards girls, and it was only within the past year or so that I've began to see it for what it was: envy. \n\nI've also talked with other trans folks and experimented on my own, and, during my own experimentation (with presentation), I just get the feeling of being a man in a dress (I'm pre-everything if that makes sense). Most of the trans folks that I've talked to mention things like how I'm valid and all, and that cis people don't get these sorts of thoughts.\n\nFor some reason, that statement sounded equally as much of a death sentence as an explanation of why I was feeling the things I felt at the time. Maybe it's due to how I somehow knew that being trans would mean that I'd be concerned about the legal issues, employment, passing, and how people around me would start treating me. Maybe I secretly don't want to be trans and somehow need to find some pride in being a man again, but I digress.\n\nDuring this period of exploration, I've also spoken to cis guys, and asked them whether they had those strange feelings, like that weird attraction from a young age, or that nagging urge to be their partner. Most of their replies were along the lines of no. One of them didn't answer the question and said that it didn't matter when the attraction started, only if there were feelings of attraction in the first place.\n\nSo... there's nothing wrong in being interested (in a manner that somewhat comes close to romantic attaction) in your TEACHER and classmates before you reach the age of ten, of all things? \n\nI've also gone out of my way to deconstruct my personal feelings towards things regarding being trans. That includes disproving the entire AGP\/ETLE thing, my personal thoughts on being a femboy (which I thought of about five years ago. Also, I just want to be a regular girl, not the hyper-feminine ones which femboys tend to chase. Also, I feel that reducing an identity down to presentation wouldn't work out for me, as I'd want more).\n\nI have kind of given up on the notion that I can be a girl, and I just hate how my own actions towards other girls and women in general come off as creepy when I genuinely don't know why I am so compelled to look at them. Yet, I don't want to be a guy. I've been trying for so long, but yet I can't seem to ever be like the guys around me.\n\nSo...why can't I be normal?\n\nAs I am right now, I'll have to sacrifice a ton of things just to feel stable. I wouldn't be able to get into a relationship because I'd just end up envying my partner for being... female. I'd end up looking at my own colleagues and wishing that I was them (which has happened before), and honestly, it's pretty fucking depressing, given how some of them are married, or are in relationships, and I just... feel so disgusting and creepy just looking at them and having thoughts of being one of them. I still see the faces of the girls I've looked that over ten years ago, and I wish I could forget.\n\nIf anything, talking to the people that I have just made me feel that I'm not supposed to be like this, but I somehow am, thanks to a fluke of nature. I'm also not mentally strong enough to sort this stuff out, and to be honest, a part of me just wants to leave it as is right now. After all, I won't die if I don't get into a relationship, or if I end up envying the girls around me. I kinda feel that it's... better for me to remove myself from those sorts of situations so I at least remain stable (a part of me wanted to go to a country like Syria, where I'd primarily see men instead of women, but I realized that I'd still want to be one of them, and I'm not willing to emigrate to that country given the political unrest there).\n\nYet, if you offered me a pill that would numb these feelings, I don't know if I would take it. Some parts of my life choices, and too much of how I feel, has been subconsciously informed by the desire to be a girl, and, if I took that away, I don't know who I'd be. Even after all that, I don't want help, as I don't believe that it'll do anything. At this point, I'd rather unalive myself over going through this same thing every single day. I've also drafted up plans for what happens to my property and accounts after I'm gone, but I'm too afraid of the pain when I go. Furthermore, I'd just traumatize my family for life, and I don't want that for them. I don't even live life for myself, and I wonder just how much more of myself I must kill off just so the people around me can see the walking fa\u00e7ade of a person who's sad, but overall, coping well with life, and rest easy. After all, there are more important issues for the people around me to settle apart from my gender, and honestly, in the words of my mom, \"\\[my\\] frontal cortex hasn't fully developed yet\", so I'm unable to make these sorts of decisions for myself yet (which is kind of true). Anyway, even if I can't look at myself in the mirror, or even if I kept trying and trying again to fit in with the guys, but fail again and again, it's just another stumbling block in life, and that it's probably something wrong with me, right? Please tell me I'm the one who's fucked in the head.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678621793.0},{"title":"Being trans, how much fiber should I eat per day?","author":"theysauru5","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11pfvdd\/being_trans_how_much_fiber_should_i_eat_per_day\/","text":"The question is easy enough to search online for cis people, and the answers I\u2019ll see often recommend that men eat 30-38 grams\/day while women eat 21-25 grams\/day.

However, my sister is one of their administrators. Some recent hiccups with my sister and and my partner at their workplace that led to my sister resigning her admin position over my partner (and her too) being mistreated. Apparently there were a lot of misunderstandings and the owner and other managers have since come to the table and apologized for their behavior and made concessions and asked for her to come back, which she eventually agreed to. Apparently there was a misunderstanding that they were threatening my partner's job, which apparently was not the case and they never intended to terminate her, but they were talking mad shit that my partner was lying about something but my partner proved to be correct, and they had simply lost (and later found) the correct paperwork proving my partner was indeed correct.   \n\n\nThis situation has put the fear of god in me because employers, no matter how close to your heart and family, are never a safe bet. They may respect her pronouns and call her by her real name, but that doesn't mean they respect her disabilities (which were a source of conflict in this disagreement at one point.) Should she need to go job searching again in the future, I don't want her to be in a position where she is required to use her deadname or old gender markers in order to find employment. I just can't assume that every employer is going to respectfully use her pronouns and real name. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI make her resumes for her, and as shit hit the fan at her current workplace I decided to spruce up her old resume in more feminine colors (just in case) and I couldn't decide if I should put her real name on there this time.

Now that her job is safe and secure and the misunderstanding is cleared up, I want the security of knowing that should she face a job search again in the future, I don't have to worry about her being outed, clocked, deadnamed, or anything else all over a resume and a lack of preparation.   \n\n\nWe are in South Carolina, and she has not had surgery nor HRT. She passes because she has a naturally feminine body and voice and pretty much always has.

I am willing to take steps to resolve any issues needed to get her gender marker changed, but I'm honestly not sure what we need to do. We're both autistic, and we have a bit of trouble understanding and making sense of what we've read, and perhaps taking it a bit too literally.

I (amab) last year finally accepted to be trans after 30+ years of denying it (nope it won\u2019t go away and will come back). You could probably say the egg cracked and I began slowly to transition socially. However I don\u2019t see transitioning medically as a life saving necessity. There are many problems (for example almost daily research on the topic) but none of them is life threatening.\n\nI see a medical transition more as an improvement because it would lead amongst other things to the alignment of my body with my feelings, the change of name and gender marker in the registers and other advantages. Thus the thought to continue (go all in with it) comes back quite often. On the other hand and as we all know the process is hard and long and many people can be lost on the way. There is also no guarantee for success (interestingly my stance in that changed a lot since I started seeking counselling in the sense that the goals of a transition became more realistic and that is okay). \n\nPart one of my question to you folks would be, under the condition that it was no life threatening necessity did you go all in with the medical transition. And what were the arguments which helped you decide to do it\/not to do it? \n\nPart two would be did. your opinion on GRS change during your transition? At the moment I would definitely want GRS because my transition would not feel complete without it. That doesn\u2019t make the decision to really continue medical transition easier because that surgery has a lot of consequences as we all know.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678649681.0},{"title":"What does an egg crack feel like?","author":"Divlfovl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11pm4jn\/what_does_an_egg_crack_feel_like\/","text":"And how did your gender euphoric\/dysphoric experiences differ after your egg cracked as opposed to pre crack?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678646452.0},{"title":"Did taking estrogen cause your back to hurt more than it used to?","author":"Mekelaina","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11pm3vk\/did_taking_estrogen_cause_your_back_to_hurt_more\/","text":"Hi all.

Low estim is also caused by the fact that most women see me as a male and so as someone who could be misogynist. i have paranoia and persecution syndoms and i feel thats because i fear that women percive me as someone who dont fit my values (but at the same time i dont always respect my values) and i hate me for being percived like that and having sometimes thoses comportements.\n\nhonestly, i never seen a man who is not misogynist at a point, i never had a figure of a man fiting my values (not being misogynist).\n\nyou may think why is so important for me to not being misogynist, i think thats mosty bc my mom were victim of domestic abuse which rly mark me, and as i said, i seen in my young age how man can be misogynist and how im puched to act like that.\n\ni dont want to be a toxic male but i feel like the only way to dont be toxic is to be a woman, the only way to dont be percived like a typical cismale is to be a woman.\n\nin the other hand i admire woman, society and males makes life rly hard for them. i just want to be percived as a woman by woman, i dont want males to see me as one of them bcs i hate how they act. i want to be with woman and face with them sexists behavior beacause i hate it, but i dont feel legitimate because as a male i dont have to take woman visibility on feminism + i can have misogynist behavior so it would be hypocrit. i feel like the only way to be myself is to stop being a male in order to stop to have a bad behavior and fight sexism with woman but i feel like the only way to do that is being a woman.\n\ni also feel like being a woman would make me more understand woman, their life, how they feel... and i could have more passionnate relationships (friends and love) bcs i feel like cismale role make relationships really poor and not stimulating.\n\nim i getting false ideas ? is transitioning a good way to feel right with myself or sould i find another solutions ?\n\nlattely i was really really happy like never beforee about the idea of making a transition, but i made a coming out to my mom and she had a very discouraging speech and now i feel lost. i felt that transition was the solution to be happy but now transition inspire me pain in the future.\n\ni also just want to precise that i dont feel bad about my body, i feel bad about being pushed in toxic male behavior, having toxic male behavior and being seen as a male by woman.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678626124.0},{"title":"Which size binder should\/can I pick?","author":"Alone-Campaign-1873","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11pds8h\/which_size_binder_shouldcan_i_pick\/","text":"I'm looking to maybe buy a binder, and I've been told spectrum outfitters would be best place to get it.

For example, I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have a good amount of friends growing up, but because of my town\u2019s demographics they were mostly white, and even after moving to an area with many more asian people to go to university, I find that I have little in common with most that I meet because I grew up with minimal exposure to asian culture. \n\nNow, as I\u2019ve started looking more and more at transition timelines and similar things online, which are basically all predominately white spaces, this disconnect has gotten even worse, and I\u2019m worried that even if I do transition and it happens to go well, I\u2019ll still never be happy with myself because I\u2019ll always be wishing that I was white too. \n\nI know that this is something completely out of my control, and that it\u2019s likely something I need to talk to a professional to, but I\u2019ve just always wished that I could be white, and now when I picture what I wish I could look like, I\u2019m imagining a white woman, which obviously is unrealistic.\n\nIf you have any advice or even just any words of support I would really appreciate it <3.\n\nTLDR: I look asian but am always thinking of myself as white bc of my upbringing, and looking at people transitioning in white-majority spaces online has made me extra self-conscious about this disconnect.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678553406.0},{"title":"How did you manage to pay for surgery?","author":"Prior_Eggplant7003","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11p5yg6\/how_did_you_manage_to_pay_for_surgery\/","text":"Hey everyone, a serious issue that I would love to discuss and get your input on is how expensive it is to pay for surgeries to transition. \n\nI personally went totally bald at a young age and when I began transitioning I needed to spend about $32K on two hair transplants - my entire life's savings.

I don't expect them all to be answered, especially if they are complicated, but literally even a little insight or help would be really appreciated. Thank you!\n\n* How can I address my AMAB thinning hair and receding hairline? It's not terrible (, but it's been about 10-15 years since I've felt I've really had a fully full head of hair. My understanding is that HRT will not be able to address that much at all, correct?\n\n* Along those lines, should I look into whether a hair transplant works for me before or after I start HRT (or does it not matter)? I don't think I'll need to use body hair for a head-hair transplant, but if I do, how does that work when my body hair is much shorter than my head hair?\n\n* How does body hair change after a single laser\/etc appointment? I don't think I need to be hairless per se, I'd be fine with just much lighter (and maybe shorter) body hair. Will a single appointment move me closer to that in a way that looks somewhat natural? Or is it a \"once you start, expect to go through the entire process if you can\" sort of thing?\n\n* Same, but with facial hair - I currently can grow a somewhat thick beard. If I start on the laser\/etc hair removal process on my face, when should I expect to no longer be able to grow a masculine-passing beard? In other words, will I need to shave regularly to avoid having a beard that looks weird\/unnatural, until the hair-removal process is complete?\n\n* I've been talking to a therapist (gender affirming but not a specialist). If I \"formally\" start the transition process, is there a specific resource I should add that can give me mtf-specific transition guidance?? Or just ask lots of questions in trans-friendly communities\/spaces and figure it out with whatever doctor can monitor and prescribe transition aids?\n\n* If I leave my state for a few weeks at a time, how can I manage HRT doses?\n\n* Can I just follow skin-care advice for cis women, or are there better options (at least for starting off on a transition process)?\n\n* How long do I have to decide if I want to preserve some sperm? Does that need to be before HRT, or do I have time to decide?\n\n* If I want to \"stack the deck\" in favor of a more feminine\/curvy body post-transition, then what should I be doing now physically? Is it even worth bothering to work out hips\/thighs\/butt muscles, if HRT is going to cause muscle loss? Or is it EXTRA important to do that now? Should I put on some pounds of fat (I'm 5-foot-9 and 150 lbs currently)?\n\n* vague anxiety noises\n\nI expect that some of these are just unpredictable, and will vary a bunch person-to-person.

I am not trans myself, but many people I love are, and if I have a child that happens to be trans it would be essential for them to get the healthcare they need. So I have a question. If someone lives in a state that bans trans healthcare for minors, is it possible that they could see a doctor in another state that does not have this ban in order to get the healthcare they need, either via driving or via video call appointments? Would it be legal for them to get that healthcare since the doctor is in another state, or does it depend on where the patient lives? Yes, it would possibly be a LOT of driving but it's the only possible loophole I could think of.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678553314.0},{"title":"what are some things i can do with my transmasc friend to help affirm his identity?","author":"absurd_thethird","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11ods70\/what_are_some_things_i_can_do_with_my_transmasc\/","text":"in the past, i took a transfem friend of mine shopping for new clothes and showed her some makeup tricks early in her transition, and she said it really helped \u2014 is there something similar i can do with my transmasc friend? men don\u2019t really care about makeup\u2026 clothes kind of. idk. maybe we could grill hot dogs or something.\n\nany ideas would be appreciated bc i\u2019m struggling!! meetup is in a week lol.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678519587.0},{"title":"HRT WITHOUT ANTIANDROGENICS","author":"DarkMagicianPona","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11otitb\/hrt_without_antiandrogenics\/","text":"Hiya!

I have recently stopped taking it cause I was feeling some side effects I didn't like at all and will ask about them to my doctor in my next appointment.\n\nI found out that Finasteride is an antiandrogenic and antiadrogenics are diurethic as well, so I'm pretty scared that taking other antiandrogenics can cause the same if not similar side effects. I made a little research and apparently HRT for MTF can be done without antiandrogenics.\n\nAnd here's my question(s). What can I expect of an HRT without antiandrogenics?

I know this question has been asked and I might be a bit annoying, but I am absolutely boggled. I suppose you can call it an identity crisis?? I've been through multiple phases of this. I've always read genderswap manga and novels. (It always had to be MTF, too lol). Always kinda self-inserted myself into the protag's place, but never really thought much about it. \n\nI don't know what to really say or think of myself. I recently reconnected with a friend, and they came out as trans to me. I browsed subreddits like egg\\_irl and traaa, for a bit until I just kinda stopped. When she came around, I was like \"oh shit, forgot that existed.\" and I've been kinda spiraling since then. \n\nI've tried thigh highs and painting my nails, just to test the waters, I suppose? (ig I got what you could call a euphoria boner?). But recently after getting \"euphoria\" after painting my nails, I painted them again after a week. I kinda expected to feel that feeling again, you know? Maybe it would confirm if I was trans or not. Did not experience it. I don't think I have gender dysphoria, because it's fine being a dude for me. No bottom dysphoria or anything. If anything it would be my voice or my name, but I feel like everyone has voice dysphoria. The name could be just cause I don't like it.\n\nI don't really feel anything that could make me think I was trans? Besides the \"euphoria\" (idk what to call that feeling anyway), I'm just kinda all muted up in the emotion department! Lately, I have had thoughts about wanting to be a specific girl in anime\/manga\/novels (which I feel about men in fiction too anyway), but I feel like it's been forced because I'm aware of my thoughts about my identity? Like my brain is doing it on purpose, just to confuse me, I suppose?\n\n I'm pretty messed up in my ole head. If I were to be trans, I feel like I'd do a disservice to fictional characters. Like my favorite male characters of all time, I want to be just like them, and I feel like if I were to be trans... I wouldn't be able to relate to them at all?

Is this normal for coming out?\n2. Has anybody else had something like this happen?\n3. Is this ok for allys to do? \n4. Any advice on what to do in situations like this?\n\n\nI came out to my family (i am nonbinary) almost a year ago. At the time they were half\/half in terms of being supportive\/being unsupportive.. for example they were understanding of me desiring to interect with local lgbtq orgs, when I needed to switch therapists, they accepted them being gender affirming as a needed component.\n\nWhen I first came out, I asked them to use they\/them and got the response that it would be very difficult but that they would try. (Technically, it was the second time I asked about pronouns but the first time I wasn't aasertive\/chickened out a bit since they seemingly wanted me to keep using she\/her) \n\nSince then they would write 'person' instead of 'lady' on cards, and referred to me as a person, and as nonbinary. \n\nBut my parents also would still refer to me as female when talking about me and my sisters, did not once use they\/them and when I was honest about dysphoria things in terms of other people (for example, the first time I wore a binder around extended family, I told my mom i felt sad nobody had noticed and that it was frustrating (body dsyphoria) She advised me then not to tell my extended family I was nonbinary and implied that they would either accept it without me asking\/they would figure it out, or that it was inappropriate of me to do so) my mom also has shown resistance to some potential names, doesn't seem happy thinking about me changing my name or wearing binders, and while i haven't told them i am interested in top surgery, she seemed afraid of that too?\n\n\nSo I decided that I wouldn't ask my sisters to use my pronouns. I was worried that they wouldn't, or that they would but it would pit them against my parents. I already have relationship issues with my parents and my sisters are younger than me and I don't want it to affect them anymore than it already is. I also decided not to talk to extended family since it kinda seemed like coming out to my close family hadn't gone well... and I didn't think they would support me if it meant going against or inconveniencing other family members. I kinda stopped talking about it outside of therapy too. \n\nI did start using pronouns at work and other places (like therapy or my primary doctor) and it went fairly well.\n\nI have been trying to adjust to a lot of bad things, (one being losing my job\/realizing I am disabled) and I would like to move out but don't have the ability currently. So it's not like the issue of me being nonbinary is the only thing affecting my relationship with my parents. \n\n\nA few days ago (during a conversation in which I was upset) my parents asked me if it would help if they called me (name) instead of (deadname). I had brought up the name with them before, and while I have been trying it in therapy, as well as when ordering food and stuff, i hadn't asked them to use it.\n\nI asked if they would use it in front of other people, they said yes.\n\nI asked if they would use the pronouns I asked them to, and they said it would be easier to use (name) in a way that sounded like a 'no' or a 'it's too hard.'\n\nSkip forward to today. My sister is home from college and my mom asks me to chat.\n\nThey (two sisters, my mom) tell me that they will use my pronouns and the new name.\n\nI was really caught off guard. I tried to be happy, and to thank them. I felt like I was being put on the spot, and I couldn't understand why my mom had suddenly 'changed her mind' as well as telling my two sisters (including one I do not have a good relationship with) before talking to me.\n\nIt was awkward, and I could feel the tension coming from me not being happy\/grateful enough despite me being terrible with social cues.\n\nThey left on an errand and once everyone was gone I actually had an anxiety attack and I am trying to figure out what the heck happened. \n\nI couldn't calm down enough (or really, get myself to pretend I'm not upset around them) by the time they returned, so it became obvious that I wasn't happy and my mom came down to talk to me.\n\nIn all honesty I didn't think it wise to talk about it so close to it happening (and I had just had an anxiety attack) so I kept hinting and then saying directly that we should talk later on. But she kept asking me questions, about why I wasn't happy and if I wanted to be called (name) and have them use they\/them. I answered her questions and revealed that I was upset and caught off guard, and that I didn't understand what had changed, or why she had talked to everyone before me. She told me she needed to do it while everyone was present, and that she was trying to make me happy, and other things.\n\nI know she felt like it would be 'unfair' to not tell the sibling I have a worse relationship with. And I think she probably decided to tell her instead of me doing so because she is aware that she is more likely to listen to her than to me.\n\nBut the conversation ended with her clearly being upset and me feeling like I've ruined everything. I'm worried that they won't use my pronouns or name anymore and I don't know how to face them. I am stuck living here for the time being, so while I think distance would help, it isn't possible currently.\n\nAlso, everyone is aware that I am upset and if the one sibling realizes that I upset mom (or didn't appreciate her 'support') i am afraid she will retaliate.   It doesn't take much for her to start being a bully to me, she is like that most of the times we interact.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678501201.0},{"title":"I was not included in my work's Women's Day acknowledgment.","author":"WerthlessB","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11n0xpd\/i_was_not_included_in_my_works_womens_day\/","text":"I've been actively avoiding most social media for months now for my own peace of mind.

This moved me to obsessively research and asking around (e.g. how does hormone treatment looked in the country I was living at the time). This all ended up with me coming out to my wife in a way that might not have been the most sensible. I broke down crying, blabbered about everything and idk. It ended up with my wife having a mental breakdown of her own. Saying things to me from \u201cbut you look so handsome, why would you want to get rid of this?\u201d to saying that I lied to her: \u201cI finally had ONE good thing in my life and you lied to me\u201d (paraphrasing).\n\nIn my mind it came to \u201cI already have everything anyone could ask for and I\u2019m here, selfishly trying to take everything away from my wife\u201d.

She can present as herself, her team and all the people that she works with are happy that she is there, she is respected, and she contributes to the organization.

Earlier tonight I came out to my Catholic, Republican parents, and their response was... not what I was expecting, especially given their previous rhetoric. They seemed to have already suspected it, and held the opinion that I would always be their child and would always love me.\n\nHowever, for some reason, since then I've felt weirdly stressed, if not awful about things. I've been struggling with depressive and anxious thoughts over the past few weeks, however I thought that coming out to my  parents would ease some of that, and it did for a moment, but now I have kind of a \"now what?\" type of feeling of dread and stress and now I'm pretty much back at square one with how awful I feel.\n\nIt doesn't help that I haven't felt that confident in my gender as of late, mostly due to living it being too stressful and overwhelming, and so when I told my parents I was transgender, I didn't specify the name I had been actually living under for the past several months and didn't even specify any pronouns, and didn't correct them when they technically misgendered and deadnamed me as a result. Bringing my trans self into the same realm as the version of myself that is my parent's child made me feel less confident in my gender, and now I barely even feel like as much of a woman as I used to. Like it's not something to hide and play around with anymore, now it HAS to be real. I never felt much actual bodily dysphoria growing up; I just caved after my anxious brain didn't shut up about it and it did feel more real and true to myself. But real doesn't equal better after all, and now I just feel... weird with myself.\n\nAnother thing is I feel like I should be thankful that they're accepting, and almost feel bad for having such good parents when so many of us have awful family situations to fight through. My friend who had a rough coming out experience and a bad relationship with his parents was noticeably cold when I made what I thought would be a joyous announcement; I know I should be empathetic towards him, but is it wrong for me to expect more congratulations? I'm worried it'll make me sound like an awful person again given how lucky and privileged I am to have this situation.\n\nI put so much weight in my life into coming out that now I literally do not know what to do given how underwhelming it was. I feel stressed, anxious, and empty, and almost wish I never had told them. My life feels so weirdly empty that now I'm back to depression again and don't really feel any better.\n\nAnyone else have this experience? This post-outing emptiness and overall bleh-ness, while you feel to some degree relieved you also feel so weird about it.

I think it's mainly because of that that i was in denial until now (i'm 23). Like \"If i wasn't bullied or if no one compared me to a girl, would i still feel like that ?\".I know the thing \"If you had two pills\" and yeah since i'm a child if i could just press a button or take a pill to wake up the next morning in a woman body and everyone acting it's normal i would do it. The question is a little more difficult now that i doubt of my legitimity so.\n\nLike, what if the thing i think is disphoria is just my envy to be accepted (even if i know that being trans will not be easy socialy).\n\nAlso, i had some internalized transphobia and when i was a teen i was ashamed when i dreamed being a girl, or when i tried my mother clothes etc. (even if i had a lot of euphoria doing this)\n\nRecently i heard about \" autogynephilia\" and it scared me a lot. Since teen i watched lewd content about gender bend imagining i was the boy turning into a girl.\n\nAnd recently as i try some things (changed haircut for exemple) and for like one of the first time i was watching myself in the mirror with smirk.\n\nI hate my genital too (i'm attracted to girls but other male genital disgust me a lot less that mine) and being aroused. When i shaved myself i was surprised being aroused when i finished. Didn't even notice it a first because of the euphoria of the shaving.\n\nBut still, what if i was just a femine boy that don't accept because of his trauma taking refuge thinking he's a girl inside ? Like the needing of feeling legitime is restrictive but in the othen hand now that i admitted having doubt at least i can't imagine staying in my body like that.\n\nI have this impression being in a problem that don't have solutions because i would never be hundred percent sure. If i stay the boy i would have to continue fighting the envy to be a girl, and i cannot transition because i don't think i have the right.\n\nAnd on the other hand i'm like sobbing \"but why does this body disturbs me so much, why can i just satisfy myself being a feminin boy\".\n\nAnd when i think i know what i want (well, i think deep inside me i know but yeah..) something happends. FOr exemple when i get aroused i do what we do to make that stop and feel so so so ashamed of myself. Or when i remember little me thinking about that i cannot think it was just to run away from the world where people were bad at me.\n\nEven if it's also possible that my fear of the world make me doubt. I have depression,  agoraphobia, social anxiety etc. and even if i would love to walk around the world as a woman i think i'm not stronger enough anyways.\n\nAnd even if i claim trans woman are woman i can't stop thinking when i think i know what i want that i'm born a boy, i'm a boy, and i need to accept that i'm a boy even if i would have prefered being a woman. I have the impression of just doing a \"whim\" (expect its the good word).\n\nTo end, i'll say again that all i think just apply to my view of myself. Even if it's possibly weird i respect all trans womans it's just with me that i have this impression of never be able to be a girl. Maybe because i'm just a traumatized boy i dont know.\n\nI except i didn't hurt anyone, am just lost.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678481251.0},{"title":"Trying To Decide Between Pills or Injections","author":"BetterCallSam_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11nufww\/trying_to_decide_between_pills_or_injections\/","text":"So I (MTF23) started HRT yesterday (fuck yeah!).

I did network with terfs but for my own reasons which included finding this very disturbing piece of what seems to be the puzzle of what motivates terfs. In that regard, I am only expressing my personal opinion based on my own experiences. I am not claiming that I'm necessarily right, just that this is worth thinking about. \n\nSo, I'm not sure how many of you actually look into what terfs believe. I imagine that not wondering about it might be the more sane choice actually. Regardless, i did some digging. By which i mean that i have invaded the online terf scene of my own country before it actually became a thing and installed myself as a vocal opponent of self-id before it even became a topic amongst radfems. Still, it took me several more years to really figure out the motivations driving them:\n\nOf course, as everyone would expect, radical lesbians and closeted trans men play a role - however, they actually aren't as big a part of the movement. Instead, there are many women who i personally would classify as entitled female pedophiles - but that's just my personal opinion. The facts are as followed:\n\nThere is a strong tendency to want to reframe sexual violence into a gendered crime with men always being the victims. Occasionally, the topic of the law not accounting well for the reality of underage boys ra*ing adult women. Many of them insist that while boys can be victims, only males can be offenders, so it's always a male's fault. And I'm saying specifically male instead of man because the vast majority believes that sexual violence is inherent to the male human while the female human always has to defend against male attacks in her life is shaped by that.\n\nStill, one might argue that this is a bit sus but in no way actual evidence pointing towards terfs being pedophiles - and so far I'd agree. However, let's talk about what terfs believe the trans movement to be:\n\nFirst of all, it's all controlled by wealthy pedophiles. There is no explanation as to why rich pedophiles would have to scheme to get whatever they want in a capitalist society, other than them wanting to be public about their pedophilia for some reason. Now, depending on which version of the story they believe, either the entirety of lgbt was actively created by these pedophiles to pave their way towards their kinda undefined goal. The other version used by the less transphobic than brainwashed terfs is that the lgbt movement has been infiltrated by those pedophiles.\n\nNow, being a curious person myself, i didn't just say that this is bullshit before actually looking into it. And what i found was that most of the leftist movements are actually financed by leftist financers and leftists parties and basically the entire left wing is politically connected and they all kinda, sorta halfways work towards a common goal that is quite left-wing. So basically, exactly as one would assume and actually no pedophiles.\n\nYet, they keep insisting that the driving force behind all of it is pedophilia - almost like everywhere their imagination fills up the empty spaces in their stories, it always turns to pedophilia. In other words, these women very, very visibly are obsessed with pedophilia and at the same time, they actively work to reframe all sexual violence into males committing those crimes against females while attacking everyone who points out that young boys can also be abused by their mothers.\n\nAnd of course, being obsessed with pedophilia and fighting constantly to be put in a position of full immunity against any accusations of pedophilia - it's nowhere near proof that these women are indeed pedophiles. Some are as i already said also closeted trans men who hate trans men for having what they don't allow themselves. Some are radical lesbians who want to ensure that all women who love women never also love men or even just trans women who were assigned male at birth. I wouldn't defend either of those and also not the people who just follow the terf movement but there are explanations why these women join this movement.\n\nRegarding the women who at the same time want to fight trans people while also fighting to make sexual violence into a crime only males can commit - they have really no other motive than their wish to fight a very visibly nonexistent pedophile conspiracy.\n\nSo, is it just me or has anyone else also noticed this obsession of terfs with pedophilia and framing it as a male crime?\n\nPS: I wanted to know why they really attack us and after five years of research this was the conclusion i came to. I'm not saying these women are even aware of why they're doing what they're doing and that the way they treat kids is problematic. I just noticed this trend amongst them and being now really done with this research, i am just sharing this as an approach that might lead to understanding better the kind of enemy we're presented with.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678474300.0},{"title":"Belly throughout transition","author":"Staattic","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11nx6my\/belly_throughout_transition\/","text":"Hi, I'm 9 months HRT and I've been doing physical training very consistently, to a point that I feel confident to say that I'm definitely above average fitness.

It's my first  day at the new place even though I worked with them year ago as a girl and had an amazing experience with manager, crew and  customers. I had to stop HRT and restarted it recently. I have my hair cut to 2-3cm so I look too androgenious than female so I passed HR as a boy (even though they have checked my info about the period of working with them in the past so they most certanly know my real female name and even saw ID in their system as they specifically asked to check it and they were okay).\n\nQuestions:\n\nSo, I'm going there as a boy who looks extremely feminine and should somehow maintain that before natural outing which won't take long as I sound and look like some stereotypical lesbian girl.

I don't want any misunderstanding so I'll probably ask for a neutral badge, like Sanie or something and on any gender related question respond \"I don't feel like talking about it\" both with staff and customers. I don't have to answer to that, right?\n\nI want to ask you about ID. I have ID with my actual name Kasandra and the old one with male name which is still not expired by date so I could present it, it's not FBI so nobody is gonna even check it. Is it okay?

Gonna try and keep this brief. But first, some background!\n\nI've been questioning my gender since the start of 2020, and it's gotten to the point where I'd like to start HRT, at least to see if it's right for me. I'm still closeted, tho my sister and immediate friends know im not cis. Seeing as I'm still at home and on their healthcare, this is primarily for my mother and father, who are both very caring and accepting of things I want to do, and are also Reagan Era Conservatives (though I think that might be slipping more these days to being more middle of the road).\n\n**Option 1: Phase 1 and 2...**\nThis option is my current primary option. Basically, ease them in and tell them I've been feeling this way for a long time and that I'd like to do a small trial run to see if this is right for me, and can stop taking it if im not happy with the results (which is all true). If I more than likely do enjoy the results, then come out *again* saying this is who I really am. It would be complicated but largely safe with easy outs.\n\n**Option 2: Text or Letter...**\nI'm not a fan because of how impersonal it feels, but writing a text or letter to tell them how I feel. Can work as an easy out if things go south, but I feel like it's more likely to go badly if it's not face to face. \n\n**Option 3: Corner them...**\nGet into a situation where I'm home or in a car with one or the other and then come out to them where they can't leave and have to listen. The biggest problem is I *also* can't leave the conversation and more or less have to do one at a time, so it's not 2 vs 1. \n\n**Option 4: Oops, accidents happen...**\n\"Accidentally,\" leave out some super obvious flags that im queer\/trans and see if they ask first. Maybe leave a \"how to come out to parents\" page open on my desktop. Arguably, I have already been doing this with zero response positive or negative, so idk if it's gonna work (I literally have 2 pins with the pride flag in my collection lol)\n\n**Option 5: suck it up and have a conversation like an adult...**\n... yea. Honestly, I'd like this is the one I'd like to do the most, but im worried that if I say or highlight the wrong thing, I'd blow my only chance. While a lot of these rely on a specific crutch, they make me feel like things are gonna turn out better than if I just sat everyone down and had a heart to heart. \n\n**Option 6: Stay sad and closeted, nerd...**\nNot ideal, but by golly, it's safe!\n\nJokes aside, thank you for reading. Again, I've been overthinking this for years so I'd be happy to hear any advice or tips.

I am at a huge crossroad at the moment and need insight.  I have known since basically I was 8 that I was different, but didn't really have the name for it until my early 20s.  I danced around my feelings for years, came out to a few people, but then kept going back into the closet.  I repressed everything for years and years, got married, and had a few kids but the gender dsyphoria just kept coming back again and again.\n\nEarly last year the gender dysphoria started kicking up a notch.  I started thinking about everything on a daily basis, and getting really depressed.  I realized that things weren't getting better, even though everything in my life was perfect.  And to top it all off, I felt extreme guilt for what I was putting my spouse through by keeping this secret for so long.  So I decided I can't keep doing this, that it was time to tell my spouse and start moving towards a better me, so I confessed everything earlier this year.  To say the least it went horribly.\n\nTo sum everything up, my wife has no intention of staying with me if I transition (which I completely understand, she married a man not a woman and I can't change her sexuality).  She would take the kids and move back in with her parents, and that I might be able to see them but she doesn't want me to until I transition fully.  She would not support me, and believes this is my choice to be selfish and hurt herself and our kids in the progress.  I would be responsible for ruining all of their lives in my process of \"possibly\" being happy.\n\nI was provided an ultimatum: transition and lose them, or go to therapy, get on antidepressants, and try to fix myself (as she believes gender dysphoria is a mental illness that can be cured through those means).  I decided to try for the kids sake to repress my feelings again.  And to be honest, it has been hell this time around.  While the antidepressants have greyed me out and mellowed my sadness a bit, I still feel it but I just can't express it out.  My gender dysphoria has gotten a million times worse, and consumes my thoughts pretty much all day.  I can't work because I can't think.  I wake up and look forward to just going back to bed.  At this point I don't know what to do and don't feel like I have any other options.\n\nI have been trying to keep this from her as to not upset her more, but last night she got it out of me because I haven't been myself lately.  We have been talking and she said everything still stands but at this point I don't think I have any other option but to transition.  The problem though is I will be losing not only them, but a lot in my life.  I don't think anyone in my family would support me, especially since to them I would be choosing this over my spouse and children and their already super religious\/conservative.  I also don't have any LGBTQIA+ understanding friends (most of the ones I talk to still are from college when I was covering up who I was).  I really would be losing basically everyone in my life for this.\n\nI guess my main question is, has it been worth it?  For those of you who have lost so much to be who you are, are you happier?","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678396617.0},{"title":"Work peers are transphobic - I want to stand up for the cause but don\u2019t want to be ostracised.","author":"BrattySubBoy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11mwhhv\/work_peers_are_transphobic_i_want_to_stand_up_for\/","text":"I work in an office 4 days a week surrounded by straight, white, cis bigots who enjoy watching Ben Shapiro and Piers Morgan and complain about transgender folk, LGBTQ+, and \u201cwoke they\/them snowflakes\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m relatively new to the job, and I feel guilty for not arguing against them.

I've never had an interest in Reddit as a platform until recent, I think this may be my favourite social media platform (not that I use any of the others). Since the guidelines ask of it, I was born a male but more align with female pronouns and feel that I am a trans fem.\n\nAs the title says I am questioning my identity. For about 3 years now I have been, amongst online friends, identifying as a trans female. I even made up a name for myself that I'm happy with: Anna-Rose Sophie \\[Surname\\]. I also started playing VR Chat since about May 2022. Recently I have started coming out more irl. While my parents don't know and the people I live with don't know, I have told my sister who supported me then completely forgot and continued deadnaming me and more recently someone who is somewhat of a mother figure. While we have no relation and don't talk much or hang out much, she is the one person I can always go to, the person I look up to and means a hell of a lot to me.\n\nI was diagnosed with ASD (formally Asperous Syndrome) when I was 8 and with depression in march 2022. Due to the latter condition I take antidepressants (I feel it is necessary to mention as this may affect the outcome). To make things simpler and to save me the next hour trying to figure out how to make this comprehensible, please find below RWIT (Reasons Why I'm Trans) and RWIN (Reasons Why I'm Not). This has been puzzling me for a long time now and I have never come to any form of an answer and now take to Reddit for help...\n\n# RWIT\n\n* While I don't think I have gender dysphoria (not in any significant way at least) I heard a post, shoutout OT, that said its not the dysphoria of not being a girl, its the happiness and giddiness one gets when labelled with the correct pronouns, which is how I feel.\n* I bought a female jumper thingy that's pink and its my favourite thing to wear despite it being the scariest thing I ever bought.\n* Despite my questioning I have a strong desire to continue. I'm working to grow my hair out and the aforementioned mother figure has promised to take me out to get nails done and go clothes shopping to get more female stuff. I also have a strong urge to take Estragon and begin the process.\n* In VR Chat I always feel happy in feminine avatars, Human or Furry. Also, if I get into a male avatar unironically or not for a meme or joke, it feels wrong and I don't like it.\n* I have also been told that I have a really good feminine voice even though I have barely done voice training. They even say that my normal voice sounds feminine too.\n* TRIGGER WARNING: GAME END >!Since accepting myself more than I did in the past for trans, things with my depression have slowly been getting better. Though this is likely due to my antidepressants I haven't for a long time!< >!made an attempt to end my life!<\n\n# RWIN\n\n* I still identify as male with my family and at work.\n* I have this deep feeling I'm faking it for attention. Though, despite this I also felt the same about depression before I was diagnosed.\n* Some reasons I have for thinking I'm trans have slightly changed. I used to be a trans Lesbian, not wanting to be romantically involved, but mostly not wanting to be sexually involved, with men. This has changed over the year and I think I'm Pansexual. I've realised I'm a bottom, but whats stopping me from being a bottom in a MxF or MxM relationship?\n* One reason I started identifying as trans around Covid was because of how depressed and sad I was. Despite the fact I only felt the following way inwards to myself and never to others, I thought it was wrong to be depressed as a man and accepted myself more as a woman but that way of thinking just is not true.\n\nThank you guys for taking the time out to read this.

So I sort of put that discussion on the back-burner as I was comfortable enough with my NB identity, especially since I stopped getting turbo-drunk and telling my friends that I wanted to transition lol. \n\nBut over the past few years, even though I know I'm most comfortable in femme clothes \/ presentation, I kept making up excuses for why I \"wasn't really\" trans, but it really boiled down to how society views trans people and that the struggle that transition would bring. But a few nights ago, I kinda... stopped giving a shit? I want to be happy with myself and as much as imposter syndrome tries to dissuade me, I know that transitioning is what I need to be comfortable in my body.\n\nSo here I am, a 25 y\/o AMAB person who is trying to figure out where to go from here. Thankfully, I am in a fairly good position for this, being in a Blue US State (CO), Work from Home where I rarely have my camera on, and I have a partner who is very supportive of this decision. I already have an established therapist who I plan to bring this up with next session, and my insurance says they support transgender people and cover things like Gender Affirming Surgeries (we will see, Cigna). So hopefully once I bring it up to my therapist, we can start that ball rolling\n\nSort of posting for a few reasons, mainly as an affirmation to myself and to share my story with others, but also would like some assistance in the form of resources and maybe some new friends to chat with about this? I guess I'll just ramble below:\n\n\u2022 What should I expect starting my transition at 25? I read some info that I may be a little too late for my hips to change shape, but that's not the end of the world for me. \n\n\u2022 I know HRT is an umbrella term for all sorts of hormone therapy, but what meds specifically should I be aware of for MTF transition? I know that certain meds are only started later, like progesterone for breast development, and just want to be aware\n\n\u2022 What expectations\/timeline should I have for breast development? \n\n- How will my current genitals react after being on HRT for a long time? I've heard it can atrophy but that still sort of confuses me on how it actually feels\/works\n\n\u2022 What are the negative side effects to expect when undergoing HRT?\n\n\u2022 I have a fairly deep voice, and I haven't given voice training a solid shot yet. Are there any tutorials y'all recommend?\n\n\u2022 Finally, specific recommendations of brands for gender affirming clothes? Padded Bras, but also good underwear for packing as uh, with my situation packing is a little difficult. \n\nSorry if this is overdone, head has been swimming with a lot of things since I finally came to terms with everything, and it's kind of nice to get things out, and hearing from real trans people from their experiences.

We've had a lot of talks about gender at my place and every now and then something pops out of his mouth that I just cannot fully comprehend. \n\nHe will say something along the lines of \"I just don't believe in any of it\" and calls himself a gender abolitionist. It's weird because like he respects people's pronouns and works actively on it but he has this very suspiciously TERF aligned view and I just can't really fully understand how to explain to him on how this view is problematic. He says things like \"I try to treat people like a sum of whatever they want\" or something of the like, this also is tied with i guess a believe that gender is only chosen by external forces like how people treat you but seems to ignore the part where people have to feel and then express their identity?

I wanna be a positive influence and be educational but in order to sow the seed I feel like I need to break up the hard earth that is this POV he has. \n\nThere is also the reality that I am the one in denial and I am giving him too much leeway and he IS just being a TERF or full on transphobe. If his outward interactions are gender affirming for those around him but he is feeling like gender is all bullshit, is he still being transphobic? \n\nEither way I don't want to push back hard and accidentally end up doing damage to our relationship and to his internal view of gender and Trans issues.

The euphoria, which I now know is what it was, was so much and overwhelming.

I dont think very many at all trans people seriously belive that gender roles are a accurate describer of people at all consiously, but the subconcious is a different story. !<\n\n>!I realize that there is a very terf-y direction that this sort of though process can lead you, and im not walking down that rabbit hole, but i feel like if someone asked me how i know that trans people dont confront their own steryotypes\/implicit biases\/internalized misogeny because they just look at it and say its euphoria\/dysphoria, i dont know if i could make a argument to them about it beyond the fact that i havent really seen that behavior in my limited experience, and that my gut tells me its unlikely that sort of behavior is widespread at all. and i want to have a better defense than that for my own peace of mind. !<","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678339639.0},{"title":"problematic friend","author":"themostwickedwitch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/asktransgender\/comments\/11mjhqg\/problematic_friend\/","text":"Today i was arguing with a friend about how transphobic j.k rowling is.
