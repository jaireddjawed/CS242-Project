        "text": "My wife (34f) and I (36m) have a good marriage and solid sex life, but there’s one thing that’s been eating at me a bit, and I’d like opinions from this group. \n\nShe has always been a willing oral sex partner, and she is very skilled. While we were dating and early in our marriage she would regularly finish me that way, and swallow (from the very first time she gave me oral). However, she has since stopped letting me finish that way, pulling it out at the last second and finishing me by hand. \n\nI don’t want to seem ungrateful, but I really, really prefer the “old way.” She said offhandedly once that swallowing leaves her feeling some residue in the back of her mouth/throat even the next day sometimes, and she just prefers not to. It wasn’t an actual conversation, just a comment. \n\nI haven’t said anything about it, including my preference, but I feel like it’s worth a conversation since I’m feeling this way. Advice is welcome. \n\nTl;dr: my wife stopped swallowing and I’m bummed about it.",

        "text": "I (23F) met my husband (25M) in the summer of 2021. At the time I was saving up money to move to Los Angeles to pursue acting. I have been in acting classes since I was 19, I've done theater since I was 11, and I've done many short films, indie films, webseries, and a few small parts on Amazon Prime. I have a good resume, training, headshots, reel, etc. Plus I have connections with former acting coaches to get decent representation in LA. I work as a spicy dancer (you know what I mean, lol) and make anywhere from $100-$600 on a weekday and $600-$2000 on a weekend. I also get to choose when I go in, when I leave, and how often I work..which is great with acting because it's a low stress job that can definitely work around my acting schedule. \n\nI've always pictured my life going one way.. living in LA, working towards my dreams, making friends, never having kids so I never have thay type of responsibility, traveling a lot, etc. I'm not a very \"traditional white picket fence housewife\" type of person. Not that there's anything wrong with it, that's just never been me. I've never played house or pretended a doll was my child as a kid.. I always just pretended I was on a movie set when I was little and playing. But then I met him (let's call him Jake) and fell completely in love. \n\nI wanted it to be just for that summer at first, but I kept falling harder and harder. I told myself it wouldn't work because I'd worked so hard for my dreams and I couldn't throw it away for him. He's actually an actor as well, that's even how we met. But it turns out his dream was just to be in one thing, he doesn't have a huge drive for it like I do even though he does love it, takes jobs when they're given to him, and is obsessed with film and television like me. But he doesn't practice, or go to classes, or look for auditions every day like I do. He can't move because he has a daughter (2 now, she was 1 at the time) and the mother wouldn't allow him to move and keep visitation rights. That's why I knew we couldn't last.. but I just fell so hard for him. \n\nWhen I met him it was like we had an instant connection. We'd sit and talk for hours. When filming was over we kind of ran away together. We stayed in hotels and traveled the country. It was amazing. He introduced me to so many things. I'd never been to a bar before him just to hang out, I'd never really hung out with many people before him. I'd never drank or smoked before him. I'd never been that close to someone before him. I asked during that summer if he wanted to see his daughter many times, but he kept claiming that the mother wouldn't allow him, so I didn't push it. Now she claims that he just didn't try to until after me and him finally got serious. \n\nI know I said I wouldn't, but we became official in the fall of 2021. I just cared too much for him to let him go. We've had many ups and downs since then, but overall it has been amazing. We got married last summer. \n\nThe only issue is.. sometimes I wonder if I made the right decision. First of all, we do get his daughter 10 days a month now. She's amazing and she adores me. I get along well with her mother as well. But I never really wanted the responsibility of being a parent or even step-parent. I do love her, but sometimes I find myself dreading when she's coming over because it's very difficult to do anything besides care for her when she's here. She is a sweetheart, but also very spoiled and will literally cry at the top of her lungs over every little thing. I know it's normal for a two year old, so I never get mad at her, it's just a lot. Like, once I wouldn't let her play in the closet and she cried for an hour straight. Another time I gave her Hershey's and she cried because she wanted Santa shaped chocolate. She doesn't just cry for a minute, it's always at least half an hour. He keeps trying to give me parenting advice, like saying that I need to discipline her or use a deeper tone, but when I try she just laughs. We also have to plan things around the times we have her, so it can be difficult booking acting jobs sometimes, but usually the mother works around it with us. We do have to pay her $500 a month though in child support, but that's understandable I think. Then she also always makes the worst mess, which I know is normal, but I'm also slightly autistic, OCD, and have sensory issues. It just really messes with me sometimes. But I'm just not great at this. I never thought I'd have to be. Am I really so awful that 10 days a month stresses me out this much? \n\nHe's even talked about us having our own kids and he can't understand why I never want to, but I don't. He keeps saying that it's crazy to let your family end with you and that it's amazing to know you created a human being, but I literally have zero desire for that. \n\nI've also realized how exhausted I always am now, probably somewhat because of her.. but also, he has very little motivation. The traveling has slowed down a lot and honestly all he really likes to do is sit on the couch, play games, and watch TV. We do go on dates at least once a week or so though. He says just being home and being happy with me is enough. I agree it's amazing, but I still have that sense of adventure as well. He's gotten me into bad habits, like drinking and smoking every day.. and I've noticed that my work ethic isn't nearly as high as I'd like it to be anymore. I know that's on me though and I can't really blame him. But to add to it, I had to move 2 hours away from my work, so I have a total of a 4 hour drive on weekends plus we have a toddler at home. The drive is absolutely killing my back. We had to move to be closer to his daughter. \n\nBut despite all of this, I've never felt this genuinely loved and cared for. I've never loved someone the way I love him. He's my best friend and I don't think I could imagine my life without him in it. He's my rock when I feel insecure, he makes me laugh every day, he compliments me every day, he massages me, he's absolutely amazing. We did go through a rough patch after getting married where he was abusive though. He choked my multiple times over the course of 4 months or so and also blacked my eye once by headbutting me. He has very bad anger issues mixed with autism and I can also be very pushy. I can't say I'm innocent though, there were a few times I fought back. He was pretty awful during this time and drinking way more than he does now, but I haven't seen that side of him at all since I threatened to leave. He's been to therapy, he's been getting into religion, he's been an amazing husband and dad. Also, I want to add that he was never abusive toward his daughter or to me in front of her. \n\nI just don't know what to do. A part of me feels like I'll always wonder \"what if\" because I can't move to LA or travel like I'd like. I still follow my career, it's just much harder in the state I'm in now. But at the same time, I know I'm in love with him and I know how much he loves me. He makes it so obvious, not just to me but to everyone. \n\nTldr: I'm having issues figuring out what to do with my life and relationship and it scares me a lot. I don't want to make the wrong decision.",

I don’t blame her as I wasn’t very much fun to be with during that time. I got therapy and since then I’m in a better state, we talked a bit, got intimate and we act cute together like we use to however things are different.\n\nWe see each other once a week, text all day, anytime i bring up the convo about becoming more serious again like before and having labels, she says she isn’t ready. I won’t force anything of course since she isn’t ready which i will respect, it just feels odd and maybe i just have to get use to the changed dynamics but from my perspective things aren’t progressing anywhere. Also she doesn’t call me or let any of friends know that we’re seeing each other hence the reason we can only text and see each other once a week. I’m surely willing to let her take her time as we wanted to test things out to make sure it didn’t end up the same way, for the most part she’s improved a lot herself but I don’t know if we can truly test it out in this current state. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is there a way out of this or it just isn’t viable? If you need more information feel free to ask.\n\nTL;DR We’ve been dating for awhile with no labels and need to figure out if it’s worth continuing. We went from relationship to Situationship and now curious if it will ever become a relationship again.",

I wasn't searching for any relationship but then I started having feelings for this friend, and I have no idea about what to do or what to tell her. The only thing that I know is that I want to tell her about how I feel because I don't want to have any regret in the future.

Essentially I’m just looking to gain experience and date.\n\nTo date, I’ve asked out less than 20 girls in my lifetime (I’m including elementary school). I’ve only been rejected aggressively once and it was my fault I was 15 and felt the first no wasn’t for real (I apologized to her after a few weeks and left her alone as I should’ve). \n\nI’ve asked out a girl a few weeks ago and it’s been a while since I’ve attempted to approach a girl and she unfortunately had a boyfriend (regardless if it was genuine or not it’s still a no) but she told me it was no big deal. We haven’t spoke to each other since.\n\nI’ve been on dates before (some good, some sour) and have gotten physically intimate but no sex forgot to add.\n\nTDLR - 24m with no dating experience and mother says I look unapproachable.

It’s a great bunch of guys, they support each other and tell each other everything, really some rare male friendships these days. \n\nThey do something called “brag Fridays” on their text chain, where they each mention something good that happened to them that week, or something they are otherwise proud of. It’s extremely cute and sweet. \n\nI’ve learned that in the course of brag Fridays, if they are on vacation they will often send photos from the trip. A couple years ago one of the guys sent a photo of him and his wife on a beach in Hawaii, and she was in a sexy bikini, leading someone to ask if he was bragging about the trip or his wife, or something like that. Haha, fine, very wholesome. \n\nAnyway, since that time the guys sometimes send a nice pic of their families or wives or whatever, if that’s what he wanted to brag about that week. Some of them are what I would definitely call sexy wife pics (he showed me after I asked). Sexy Halloween costumes, cute bikinis, sexy dresses, etc. \n\nI noticed that he hadn’t sent any of me like that, and he said of course he wouldn’t do that, he didn’t have my consent, and he didn’t think I’d think that was cool. \n\nOf course I think that’s sweet of him. But! I don’t know! I feel a little …boring or left out or something, it’s really hard to describe what I’m feeling. I mean I’m glad he’s sweet in respecting my privacy like that but I don’t know! \n\nSo I said, I mean, if you want to do a Brag Friday about me, it’s ok, go ahead. He said sure and was kind of excited (very cute) and asked me to send or suggest a pic that I’m ok with. \n\nI know this is so weird in a way and the reverse of the usual issue you see on Reddit. But I am kind of an amateur at this! What kind of photo would be fun for this purpose? Should I take a new one or dig out an old one? And what kind of pic? Any suggestions are welcome! \n\nTl;dr: my husband doesn’t share sexy pics of me and I’m…sort of left out!",

The situation that made me feel triggered is that he has to leave after we get intimate (he can't see me for long because his parents are strict) even though he verbalised his reason why - I still felt used. There was no emotional closeness. no real intimacy. I couldn't trust words It was hard for me. This triggered something deep inside me There was something in  me that felt awful whenever I came home. I didn't feel safe. This triggered me to go into a spiral - having trust issues (being unable to trust him fully - thinking that he is promiscuous and me messaging his ex)\n\n\nI've messaged him to get things back, and he brought up my past mistakes that were made (2/1 years ago). I felt awful. I felt guilty. \nHe thinks I doubt him but I dont. I regret my mistakes and I can only learn from them. I've apologised countless times. I feel bad this he still feels this way. I don't want to live in the past anymore. \nI've taken responsibility and accountability for my part, but he has said some nasty things over the past years - Ive always dismissed them as I thought I deserved them for my mistakes. He doesn't realise that his words hurt. \n\nAnyways, it's been a while since I haven't replied back to him, Ive had some time to think. I'm in the middle if I should help him or not. \nHow should I go about this?\n\nTLDR: I made mistakes in the beginning of my relationship as I felt triggered, and they were repeated. I take full responsibility for it. I feel bad for my past mistakes that I've made 1/2 years ago, and they are brought up whenever I am in contact with my ex. I feel guilty and remorseful. I'm not sure if I should help him since he feels hurt.",

        "text": "Prefacing to say that my ex is a public figure and you can interpret that anyway you want... I tried to think of how else to write this without saying exactly but I have to mention that part because it is the important part. I am using a throwaway but if my story is somehow recognizable even through my vagueness, please don't comment specific names. I'm reaching out to Reddit as a last resort because my social support system is not currently with me. \n\nWe have had a tumultuous relationships for 10+ years. To generalize the last couple years before we broke up, I was codependent and submissive towards him while he became more and more willing to put his hands on me, party and stay out late, and generally just a bad temper. In short, he was physically abusive towards me. \n\nWe are not legally married but we do share children.\n\nHe then had a public incident which caused him major legal issues and is still ongoing. It has caused obviously huge damage to his career but also several of our inner relationships and friendships. I believe that this was a genuine blow to his ego and rocked his world - it was stupid reckless and very serious and the first time he's facing real consequences in his life like this. He has since been a lot more lowkey than he usually is, and remorseful for his actions. Trial is ongoing but there is a good chance we can settle... but still holding our breath. \n\nThat all being said, he is also reaching back out to me and wanting to reconcile. He misses the kids. He wants a stable, more mature relationship with me. Both of our families are highly, highly supportive of us getting back together and pressuring me. He has a good heart but a lot of trauma and issues.. I know he can be good, especially if we are together.\n\nIn our last discussion together, I pieced together all the things I really wanted to say. I told him how he hurt me and what my boundaries are and how I am a stronger person now. I told him that I was only even considering things because we have children, and I also know that the incident really shook him and possibly made him change for real. He was apologetic and genuine. Then... I brought up one of our last fights in which he slapped me multiple times when I was on the ground trying to defend myself and said, \"if you put hands on me like that again, I will call the police.\" And his response was \"Come on, you can't say that\" and I said, \"I am serious. You can't beat me like a man and expect me not to stand up for myself. I'm different now.\" He responds, \"I didn't beat you like a man, that was open hands.\" \n\nI'm not fucking here to discuss semantics or do a play by play analysis of what he did that day. I got so mad, I stood up to leave and he started panicking and saying he was sorry. Then he said again, \"I'm a public person, you can't just threaten calling the cops on me when I'm already in trouble. I'm not ever going to hurt you again, but it's fucked up that you would want to even do that. We have kids.\" I said again, now our kids will be old enough to remember and if he ever does it again, I'll go straight to Youtube and social media and the police and tell everyone everything you ever did. He then says to calm down and says yes, I can go ahead and do that but he will never hurt me again so it won't be a problem. Then ends with that I'm vindictive and petty, but \"that's what I love about you.\"\n\nI told my family this exact conversation, down to every word, and they are not on my side. They are on his side completely and say that I AM being extremely petty and that it's not fair to bring up old stuff when he's trying to be better. It is going against literally everything I have worked through with my therapist for the past couple years... to the point that I am not sure what to believe anymore. I know not to bring up old issues and old fights in new fights. I know that I need to defend myself. I do not know if I am being defensive and vindictive. I do not know if I am \"bringing up old stuff\" to be manipulative. I do not know if I am overreacting to that discussion because I just want an excuse to be mad.\n\nIt just all rubbed me the wrong way but I genuinely don't know... am I just still mad at him? Was this just a normal conversation that I twisted into something horrible? Is he being defensive because I'm attacking him with the past and threatening him? Did I approach this the wrong way?\n\nI feel like I don't have anyone on my side right now. My family tells me to be less emotional and think about the future. My friends do not know about the violence at all, and I cannot tell them. Reddit, please help me think straight. \n\n**TL;DR -** Ex and I have been separated ever since he became abusive. Since then, he also got into major legal problems and has seemingly shook him in a significant way, and has reached out to reconcile. I told him in a serious conversation that I am different now and if he ever hurts me again, I will not only call the cops but talk about it publicly. During that conversation, he got a little upset that I would threaten him and I got mad that he got mad about it. Now I don't know if I overreacted, if I said the wrong things, if I approached this all wrong. My family says I am in the wrong for being petty. Friends don't know the extent of our problems. I need to set good boundaries before I do anything stupid. Reddit, can you please help me see and think straight?",

        "text": " \n\nI \\[M/22\\] broke up with my ex \\[F/21\\] in January 2023. We dated for roughly a year and I'd be lying to say it was the smoothest relationship. Yes, we had our ups and down but so does everyone else. We ended up taking a break maybe 6 months into it (I had some really terrible mental health at the time and felt that if we continued on for that period we would've destroyed what we had) Once we came back from our break the relationship was so strong. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a grave mistake on my end. She has well very upfront and rude parents. Her mom resented me after our break and told her I was never allowed at hers again. Due to having a very full household on my end we pretty much had nowhere to be private. We went on dates and such and tried to have some time for ourselves in my car but unfortunately, it wasn't the best. Cuddling in a car while it is -20c+ outside is sort of difficult. Due to the issues with her mom, she began to fight a lot with her, and well that gave me an insane amount of guilt. I would feel terrible every time she told me about a new fight with her mom or how they were no longer on speaking terms. I tried my best to show her mom that I really did love her and wasn't just trying to fool around. We both really did love each other and I still do...\n\nOver the months the guilt just grew and grew and it was clear nothing was going to change their mind. They already didn't like me very much in the beginning, thinking I wasn't good enough for their daughter. I even brought her parents wine and chocolates during the New Year and they just threw them back at my face, like it was nothing. We tried to make it work but with that going on and working like a dog to save up for school, I eventually broke...\n\nI genuinely started to believe that I wasn't good enough for her anymore, I told her like the absolute idiot I am that I was undeserving of her and she'd be better off with someone else. I told her that with her parents being how they were, we wouldn't work out. All this while still having love in my heart for her. I'm quite an idiot and still am beating myself up for doing it. She's just, I knew she really loved me for who I am, and I her. After I told her all that she ended up blocking me everywhere (understandable) I deleted every photo I had of her because of the rage I had in my during the weeks of the breakup. I threw everything away. Everything that'd remind me of her. Yet here I am still thinking about her. She unblocked me on Instagram a couple of weeks ago. It was really hard not to message her happy birthday. I just don't understand why she unblocked me. As much as I'd love to talk to her again I don't want to make it hard for her. I'd rather she forget me but I just cannot stop thinking about her. I'm just thinking maybe there's something else we could do. Maybe I could try and salvage it. I just feel like it would be more destructive than good. There is no way her parents would ever allow that, they'd probably kick her out. We didn't have a toxic relationship or anything. Now I'm just lost. I know I lost my soul mate, and I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nTLDR; I am an idiot",

He turned down management roles to tour with his band so he doesn't have any supervisory experience. \n\nAbout a year and a half ago, he made the decision that wasn't the life he wanted anymore, so he enrolled in a UX bootcamp certification program to pursue something that was still creative, but that had a career track. He has been done with the boot camp for 6 months, and he's had  a few phone screenings but hasn't even gotten to an interview stage, which has really demoralized him. \nHe's continued working part-time at a restaurant while he looks for something in the field. \n\nTbh, I'm getting stressed about it. He's really demoralized and annoyed that he's not getting interviews. For our whole relationship, I've been paying 2/3 of our rent and all of our bills. When he proposed he was in the middle of this camp and getting great feedback. I've seen his website portfolio, and he seems very talented. I assumed he'd be a hot commodity for an entry-level job. But here we are. \n\nI'm worried that we won't be able to afford to get a house or have kids if he doesn't get a job soon. I make about 85k a year, and he makes about 25k. I'm feeling the stress of the discrepancy in what I'm picking up and my 50-hour work weeks compared to his 20. \n\nAny advice for how he can get a foot in the door or what else in a similar field he should be looking at? Does anyone on here have experience starting a professional career for the first time at nearly 40?\n\nTL;DR \nMy (38f) fiance (38m) has never had a professional job.

I pay for everything, and he lives rent free. Already a good start, right? \n\nMe, I'm a woman with BPD and an eating disorder. I try not to let it over power my life, so I engage in the behaviors while he sleeps and try to not get triggered by things he does, but I am really starting to feel used and abused. \n\nMy boyfriend berates me constantly and has problems with being physically intimate with me. He doesn't love kissing me or cuddling, and he has problems coming from sex. This has effected my self esteem and closeness with him- and when I concern my problems, he doubles down on the cruelty and starts explaining why I'm so unattractive (like my shaved undercut, my valley girl voice, my eating disorder boobs). Some of the things he's said about me as a response to my insecurities have been so atrocious, that I've had to block it out. I than tell him that its obvious he isn't into me, and that we should be room mates or friends- so he doesnt feel the pressure to look for a place to live- which upsets him greatly, because he insists on being my boyfriend. \n\nHe makes me feel like a predator, the relationship was tumultuous from the beginning for many reasons, but the reality is... He's never treated me the way I feel a girl deserves to be treated. I pay for everything, which he feels entitled to.. for some reason, and when I bring that obvious reality up, he says I'm being \"jewish\" (I'm jewish) for holding that against him. He also says \"thank your Jewish rabbi's for cutting off my foreskin, now I can't feel anything\", as a response to my low self esteem from his inability to cum. \n\nSo the question is, what do I do? I know the obvious answer is to kick him out, but I'm wondering why he is with me in the first place. Why is he choosing to stay with ME? Is he just a narcissist who needs to make me feel bad as a security measure? \n\nFor the record, I have said mean things to him as well (never about his looks or status), and I am pretty obsessive about being told what I want to hear- which has triggered past relationship partners in the past (to the point of them acting in a way they otherwise wouldn't). \n\nTLDR: I am with a man who has been corroding my self esteem over the course of our relationship, I want to know what to do (I am alone in the world generally) and whether this is narcissistic abuse or something else?",

My BF recently bought a house and has been living at my apartment until it’s move in ready, then we are moving in there together. \n\nSince we’ve been cohabitating, I’ve been taking care of his dog more since I get off work before him. His dog is a sweetie, but walking her on a leash is SUCH a pain. She pulls, darts around, gets tangled in her own leash or my dogs leash, etc. For whatever reason, this is SO frustrating to me. Like getting the wires from your headphones caught on something and yanked out levels of frustrating. The dog has other issues (for example, barking at night) but I can let those go. I know my dog isn’t perfect, either. \n\nI talked to him about getting a new leash and leash training. He agreed to a new leash but basically said walking her wasn’t hard and I just needed to learn. He then basically forced me to handle her on all of our walks that night even though I didn’t want to. I was taken aback because this is way out of character for my BF. He would wait on me hand and foot if I wanted. He always goes out of his way to do things for me, make my life easier, check in with how I’m feeling, etc. I understand people can be sensitive about their dogs, especially if it’s negative feedback. \n\nI sent him a text and laid a boundary - if he wants me to take his dog places (like on hikes or errands) outside of potty walks, he has to work on leash training her. He hasn’t responded yet. I’m wondering if I’m in the right? I have some paranoia I have too high of expectations for dogs (I felt my last two boyfriends dogs were very untrained and frustrated me). Am I being too harsh? \n\n\nTL;DR: set a boundary with my BF about leash training his dog. He doesn’t seem to agree. I said I won’t be taking the dog on walks outside of going potty unless they work on it.",

Emotionally, I had dealt with the loss of the relationship about 6 months prior to the end of it. By the end of the relationship, it was mostly dealing with the guilt of letting it go on for so long.\n\nTherefore, I have been feeling interested in dating again as I have been emotionally missing that intimacy for probably 9-12 months, but due to being in the relationship until just 3 months ago I wasn't independent and single. Now that I am, I have already found myself interested in dating and wanting that back again.\n\nBring in the new girl to the picture. Without going into too much detail or context that is unnecessary, she is the roommate and friend of my best friend's girlfriend. I met her towards the end of my last relationship, she had recently moved in with the best friend's girl (couple months before my relationship ended). She was also getting out of a LTR. Immediately I had an attraction to her, but never thought much of it or spent much time around her until more recently.\n\nIn the recent months since I have actually been single, I've been tagging along with best friend and their outings, which have included the new roommate. We have had a few conversations, made some jokes, there has been what I think is flirting (eye contact, smiles at each other, sitting near each other without the other closing themselves off, etc.). It seems easy for us to spend time with each other and talk. Given the few outings with her and more time spent, I am finding myself having genuine interest in her.\n\nThe part that I am having a hard time with is understanding the perspective I should have about this. Am I just finding this girl attractive because she is cute, confident, down to earth, and fun, while simultaneously being different from my ex, therefore I am fantasizing about what it would be like to have someone like this and having some rebound feelings? Or could this be a real attraction? Would it be ok for me to just ask her to go out the two of us to get to know each other and see if it is real? Or would that compromise the situation seeing that we have a bit of a friend group going right now?\n\nTl;Dr Recently out of a LTR, met a new girl as a part of a new friend group forming. I feel like I am attracted and interested in her, but confused if it is just rebound feelings and fantasies because of my ex or if it could possibly be real attraction.",

There’s no nice way to say this, but I’m just not into her downstairs area. I never thought this would be the case with lighter skin girls, but her lips are very dark and it just turns me off. Moreover, they’re very flappy, like butterfly wings, as opposed to a petite slit that I’m used to seeing. I don’t mean to sound insensitive, and I would never tell this to her face, but when we have sex the only way I can get off is if we’re doing it from behind and I don’t have to look at it or see it.\n\nSex in general is fine, that’s not really an issue, it’s just more so that I can’t bring myself to put my mouth there.

I know that the right thing to do is to break it off, but I’m not sure what to say.\n\nThis is an FWB situation, neither of us are seeing anyone or looking for a long-term commitment. If I tell her that I’m not interested in doing this anymore she’s going to know the issue will revolve around sex or attraction. I really don’t know what to say, if she asks me why.\n\nTL; DR: I (18M) am no longer attracted to FWB after seeing her private area. How do I break things off without making her self conscious?.\n\n# I’m not saying that the previous 4 girls I saw naked were all perfect,  but the difference between them and my current FWB is NIGHT &amp; DAY…Also I’m a white guy who mainly dates white girls so I have no idea what it looks like/if this is normal cross-culturally.",

        "text": "A girl broke up with me last month and I'm still not fully over it. I felt like I connected with her more than any other person in my twenties. Although we only dated for 3 months I felt incredibly comfortable around her. Our personalities were fairly similar but we did have some different values such as  religion and family plans, although for me these were negotiable I think she may have thought they weren't. \n\nDuring the breakup she said she didn't feel a \"deep enough connection\" and in her explanations amongst other things she said that \"she never opened up emotionally to me, although I don't really open up to a lot of people\" \n\nI was confused by this statement because I always asked her a lot of questions about herself and she told me all about her life. Some things she told me i'm sure she probably hadn't told many people if anyone. They weren't necessarily her deepest fears/trauma but things about growing up, moving around, dating etc. We would have conversations for hours about all sorts of topics, things flowed easily and this couldn't be faked. \n\nThe breakup was very much a blindside and all major talking stage milestones had been reached and I thought exclusivity was pretty much inevitable. \n\nWhat could she potentially mean by not opening up emotionally, and how do you get someone to open up emotionally?\n\nTLDR: What does it mean to open up to someone emotionally",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year now. We see each other briefly between classes everyday during the week and hang out most weekends. He is a very shy person, but he opens up around me and we have good, full conversations when we’re together. That is, until he gets into these random moods. For example, today I saw him after class and I got no greeting, no hello, no anything. So I just assumed he was tired and I tried to make conversation, but it was awkward because he gave me these short responses, and if I hadn’t filled the silence there would’ve been awkward silence. He’ll randomly get in these moods sometimes—not often, maybe once or twice a month—and I have no clue what’s going on. Usually when I notice that it’s happening I’ll immediately ask him if he’s okay, but he always responds with the same “yeah” or “I’m fine” or “just tired”. I want him to know that if he’s having a hard time with something he can open up to me about it, and I have made this very clear to him. I don’t know if this short tone that he has with me is a result of annoyance with me or if he’s secretly depressed or something. And the second I want to bring it up the next day and ask he’s acting completely normal. I’m just confused. A couple of months ago, he was in this mood for over a week straight, and it continued even over his texts. I repeatedly asked if he was okay and made it clear that I wanted to talk to him and was here if he needed anything, but he kept the same excuses up. It got to the point where I seriously considered breaking it off with him even though it was only a month before our one-year anniversary of dating. I feel like I deserve clarity because I make such an effort to seek out clear communication and he doesn’t. We never argue (over serious things) and we have an extremely healthy relationship. I don’t want this to be the thing that drives a wedge between us. Any advice?\n\nTl;dr my boyfriend of one year and I have a very healthy relationship until he gets in these random moods where he doesn’t communicate with me and gives me short responses to everything. I made it clear that he can talk to me if he needs any support, but he always says that he’s fine. What should I do?",

I (18.5 f), have been in a sort of situationship with this guy (26 m) for two and a half years now.\n\nWe clicked instantly, even tho I’ve never seen him physically - we don’t live in the same country (yet we do make sure to FaceTime every day). He was, and I’m afraid still is my first love, and first everything.\n\nIn the First couple months of speaking, (during summertime), we got to know eachother, and spent pretty much all of our free time together.  I learned all about his life, his interests, anything and everything- or so I thought at the time. \n\nWe would basically speak every day, all day, and inevitably, I fell for him, and he told me he had fell for me. I had no problem leaving everything behind just to be with this man, and I have let him know so. yet, till this day, he’s avoiding any sort of commitment and any advances to actually be in an active relationship.\n\nHe would sweet talk me, telling me how badly he wants to start a family with me, how much he loves me and can’t wait to see me, yet he wont allow me things that I consider basic in a relationship- no letters, gifts, anything. he refuses to label us, let me fly to meet him or anything but having his socials (After promising me he’d do all of the above).\n\nHe lied to me relentlessly about such unbelievable things, called me names, didn’t care to even ask for my well being after an attempt and made me cry countless times.\n\nI just want out now- I care for him, but this whole relation became too harmful.\n\n Still, I can’t seem to let go, I feel unable to- He’s depressed, and I’m attached. I don’t know how to walk away without him killing himself, and I don’t know how to be alone anymore. \n\nI love this man more than anything, but he wont get himself treated- he wont see a therapist. I really am afraid that once I’m gone, he’d end it. He keeps on speaking about people leaving his life, and I’m just lost.\n\nWhat should I do? How can I leave?\n\nTL;DR\nNeed help on how to separate from a depressed partner, due to him being toxic, manipulative.",

        "text": "**tl;dr My fiance of 2 years is upset because he feels I'm unsupportive on his career journey. I feel like he's delegating his career to me because I gave an ultimatum about our financial situation and I genuinely can't see it any other way. Am I wrong in upholding this boundary? Is there a better way to explain my POV that doesn't feel like I don't \"care?\"**\n\n  \nMy partner \\[30m\\] is an immigrant to this country. In his home country, he has an advanced degree - but since emigrating, he's started from the ground up and is currently in a dead end job outside of his industry where he is both underpaid, undervalued.  \n\n\nWhen we met, his career goal was to go back to school here to become a pharmacist and was working full-time as a certified pharmacy tech for a major brand. After an argument with his manager, he quit without a backup plan. 4months into dating, I was helping him apply for a new job that eventually meant letting him borrow my car temporarily. Temporary become permanent.   \n\n\nMeanwhile, I've \\[28f\\] been in a pretty comfortable tech position making 6figs. My background is in HR and I'd call myself pretty career savvy. As a black woman specifically, I pride myself on my financial independence and growing in my career to afford going back to school and eventually changing industries. In the past, I've always been the more ambitious of ex-partners; usually the higher earner and with a more concrete career path. I had to bootstrap through college and worked very hard for where I am today.\n\nFast forward to today, and we live together. I've been carrying the financial load which, again, I don't mind. I out-earn by a lot, and I'm empathetic to restarting in this country; I don't care for traditional gender roles and am more invested in what we grow together. I've committed to him so holding down the fort doesn't mean a lot in the short term. This has also meant concessions on my part in upending my career plan to switch industries by the time on 30. I've taken significant expenses and debt, without increasing my savings as I had projected to rn. Not ideal, but totes ok as he figures it out; and we both agreed, given our goals of marriage, kids, school, and a house that he does need to *figure out a financially viable career path soon*.  \n\n\nSoon unfortunately became ASAP when I had to take on care for a family member last year. I am now financially responsible for two households (mine, and my family's) and cannot cover 70% of my partner's expenses anymore. I let him know that it's either we downsize our lifestyle or he increases his salary, but I cannot financially afford it and I'm not taking on a part time job on top of health care and my full-time gig to make it. He has since decided not to want to be a pharmacist and every other month it's a new \"get-rich-quick\" plan or complete hopelessness. All without very little action.  \n\n\nIt was a shitty journey from frustration to resentment to acceptance, but now my partner is actively looking for jobs and assuming I'll be his coach through it. He asks me to vet postings, check his resume, give tips, and more. I suggested he reach out in his network for a coach or mentor and resources to check out. He refuses those resources and relies on me.   \n\n\nThe tipping point came when he overhead a work meeting where I was describing a promotion plan for my direct report and increasing her pay. He got moody and lashed out telling me I should care more about his career than my employee and that it's not fair that my company pays so much for stupid people. The next day he got an interview request and immediately told me I'm going to help him practice interview prep this weekend. Both times, I was either half-asleep or just off work and felt blind-sided by his sudden mood-changes and asks.  \n\n\nToday I broached the subject and shared that I *do not want to* help in his career journey because I have bad experiences in the past, because it's additional mental load I don't have capacity for, and because I feel like it oversteps a boundary in our relationship for me. I feel like I've put in more of my fairshare financially to our relationship and I think he should step up. He told me I wasn't being a fair, or a supportive partner, and that it's \"fucked up\" I care more about a stranger than him (referring to my direct report). He accused me of not caring at all and just pressuring him to make more money.  \n\n\nAm I being unreasonable? Unsupportive? I'm not saying I don't want to support or offer motivation. I've even offered advice! But I feel like taking on building a career with him would tip the scales given we were are currently financially and it makes me feel uncomfortable.",

        "text": "So first of all, my friend(let’s call her Star) is also my partner, as of early January. I just called her my friend because she’s been my friend much longer, from 2021. We were very close, we both communicated well, and I know I was Star’s closest confidant. We were doing just fine as of January, but then she suddenly stopped texting me as much.\n\nI thought it was normal, yk, because we were talking fine at school. \nAs winter break came and went, we hung out a ton. We were talking, and we had a great time(at least from my perspective). But then March came. As some background, we both have issues with March. Star struggled with health issues and seasonal depression last March, as well as an asshole “friend”, which of course I supported her all throughout. \n\nFor me, this is the month where I had my mom leave me, but not through normal methods, it was an intervention by CPS. As you can tell, my mom isn’t the greatest person, and have severe anxiety, PTSD, and abandonment issues from her, which only adds to the drama of this situation.\n\nAnd then, at the beginning of March, Star started talking to me less and less. And I know it was just me, because with all my other friends, she was laughing, smiling and joking. By this week of March(the second one), she stopped talking to me completely. Star won’t even look at me. \n\nI texted her this, \n“hey bro\ni know this might be a bad time to text but ive notice youve been kinda distant lately n barely even talked to me today\nif anything is going on with you or i messed up in any way frl just let me know and we can talk abt it, yeah?\nsee u tmrw :)”\n\nand she replied\n“hey, sorry i went to sleep super early last night, and i saw this this morning. I need a break and I have nothing to talk abt rn. I value your friendship, I’ve just been going through alot and dont really wanna talk. thanks tho :)”\n\nBut I know that if nothing was really wrong, Star wouldn’t say that and act like this. We’ve both agreed and asked each other to tell the other if we have an issue with what they’ve did, and I’ve told her point blank before that if she needs to set a boundary, then set it.\nBut she’s avoiding the issue, and ignoring me, and like I said, with my past, it’s driving me up the wall. I just want to know how to deal with this, because being ignored everyday while reliving the worse moments of my life is not fun for me.\n\nI also sent Star this today(may or may not hit my limit and had a breakdown in school, had to leave during 1st period it was so bad):\n“hey man\nik this is rlly rlly outta the blue BUT LIKE\nyou remember what we spoke abt this week\ni think we rlly, rlly need to like actually talk abt it\ni didnt want to push it cuz u said that u were going through a hard time but ive noticed some things abt this time period that r actually fucking with me\nand i hate to put you on the spot but it feels like we are drifting apart as friends and so i want to talk abt it(not abt what’s happening to u if u dont want to, but recent days and how its made us feel) \nagain, im sorry to bring it up so abruptly but(unless im mistaken and if i am im sorry) it seems like youve only been drifting away from *me*\nso like\nyeah”\n\nI’d appreciate the advice, thank you :)\nTLDR; i don’t understand wtf i did to make Star start ignoring me, and she won’t give me a good reason to help me try and help the situation.",

        "text": "My gf (33F) informed me (29F) today that she emailed her ex a music video of people spitting into each others mouths and on each other. Apparently her ex loved doing this while having sex (my gf did not) and she thought it was funny at the time, while being drunk, to email her the video. We have been together for a little over a year and upon her telling me she did this I felt it was very disrespectful to me, for her to contact her ex, especially a video reminiscent to when they used to have sex. This is not the first time she has done something similar while drunk and she gets flirtatious around friends and people which i have communicated my discomfort to her about. Before meeting me she had a one night stand with a friend who she still is in contact with, which i have met and spent time around and occasionally when we have gone out to drink she will get a little too touchy for my comfort with her. \n\nShe also recently informed me that another ex reached out to her with whom she had a long past with and she felt the need to respond and check in on her. I expressed my discomfort with this but she went ahead and texted her anyways. After this i was extremely upset and we tried to discuss the situation where she said i needed to trust her and that she had no romantic feelings towards her ex and only loved and cared about me. Her reaching back out to make sure everything was okay with her ex was not going to turn into anything other than that. \n\nMy gf told me not to be worried and that i am overreacting. I feel as though she is in a sense low key cheating on me. I don’t know what else to do as this is very triggering for me n she has made it clear she will do what she wants n i just need to trust her as she has no romantic interest in any of her exes. Am i wrong for getting upset at her or should i trust her that there will never be anything romantically going on in any aspect? \n\nTL;DR-my gf reached out to her exes and thinks I’m overreacting since it made me uncomfortable even though she said she has no romantic feeling towards them. Am i wrong for being upset at this?",

        "text": "Is it weird that my friend (25M) never introduces me to his friends (27F)? We've been dating for about 3.5 years. We've met each other's families and he's met all my friends. \n\nWhen we first started dating he was relatively new to the state so he didn't have a lot of or any really close friends of his own. I always invited him to handouts and parties with my friends both so he could meet more people and just because it felt natural. My friends have all always brought along their partners or people they were dating, even if it wasn't long term or serious. My BF did invite me once to hang out with a group he had hung out with a bit, but their friendship fizzled and we never hung out together again.\nHe did become good friends with one person I introduced him to, and a new group through that friend. We've all hung out because I already knew most of those people even if I wasn't exactly friends with them before.\n\nOver time, my BF started using a bunch of apps to meet new people and was also making friends through online gaming, because he wanted more of his own friends, which I totally understand. He hung out with quite a few people he met through the apps but only a couple of these friendships stuck, which is normal. I didn't expect him to introduce me to people he only ended up hanging out with one time. During this time, he was constantly receiving messages that I would jotice because we'd be watching tiktoks on his phone or something like that. I did not want to be nosy and I wanted to respect his privacy so I never read the messages that popped up and would look away if he was responding to them. All of these messages were girls. He also was talking to the majority of these girls over snapchat. I found it a little odd that he only seemed to be making friends with girls but didn't want to be jealous so I never brought it up.\n\nI'd like to note that based on previous experiences he's had and conversations that we have had, that I absolutely have never thought he was cheating on me or that he would do that, at least physically. \n\nYou know how you can see on Facebook when your friends comment or are tagged in things? I started seeing some things he was tagged in with one girl specifically who I had never heard of. It was only a couple things, but they seemed very flirty to me. I was shocked but didn't say anything at thr time because I'm very conflict averse. Some time later, I'm embarrassed to say I read through some of his Discord messages that he had left open on his computer, and they were also seemed very flirty to me, and it seemed like he was avoiding mentioning me. For example, he mentioned in the conversation I read that he was having an anime themed birthday party, and the way it was discussed seemed to purposely exclude that I was the one throwing that party for him. Maybe I was just being sensitive though? In the following days when I was building up the courage to confront him about this, he informed me that he thought I should know one of his friends sent him a picture of her books. Lerfect segue right? I let him know I read that Discord message, apologized for invading his privacy and let him know that I would never do it again, and let him know I felt the messages were inappropriate and that he didn't seem to have appropriate boundaries if his female friends felt comfortable sending him nudes, and also that it felt like he was trying to hide me by never introducing me to these people he was constantly talking to, and that it made me uncomfortable that he seemed to only be friends with girls \n\nHis defense of the picture was that that friend is a lesbian, and they had previously joked about how girls with nipple piercings seem to always want to show everyone, and she had just gotten her nipples pierced so she sent him a picture as part of thr joke. Regarding not introducing me to anyone, he said most of the people he was talking to were old high school friends he had reconnected with so they were in a different state, and the people he met through the apps were mostly out of state as well because the apps he was finding success with don't have location parameters. He said the only way he really knew how to make friends was through flirting but he understood how that seemed inappropriate and that he would work on having better boundaries and that he wasn't trying to hide me, and then he deleted a bunch of the girls that he had added on snapchat (unprompted by me). This conversation was last spring/summer.\n\nThings seemed a lot better for the most part following this conversation, until now. My BF started a new job a few months ago that works better with his school schedule. He's made a lot of friends at this job and has been hanging out a ton (like majority of the week and sometimes multiple times a day even). He has not a single time invited me to join. Is it normal to never introduce your significant other to your friend group and my friends have just been an exception? I want to bring it up but don't want to sound insecure/whiny.\n\nTLDR my boyfriend of 3.5 years never introduces me to his friends. Should I be concerned?",

        "text": "Sorry its so long and probably a hot mess, but I never learned brevity.    \nTLDR: Wife freaks out my job situation that she knows will be resolved in few weeks then starts belittling me and acting like I can't even get a job that I want.  Bills are probably a factor.  \nI (36m) have been a stay at home dad for almost 2 years. Intentional decision made by both of us.  Money is tight, and only getting tighter, so now I'm going back to work.  Me  and my wife (35f) decided that I should switch careers.  I have been primarily a factory worker, but have done IT stuff on the side in the National Guard.  We've been married 15 years.  \n\n\nShe teaches, I do IT.  She can't even connect a printer to the computer.  I mention this, not as an insult, but to show her level of skill.  I have a temporary job lined up that I will be doing until I get a full time job in IT.  The temporary job pays well, but its factory. I need to leave factory work for reasons, so I will be working on certifications until I get a job (again she agrees with this).  I was originaly able to do first shift, but I decided that I really need to work 2nd shift instead of first so I can be available for job interviews.  We talk about it and she agrees.  I call up the company and they let me switch to second shift.  I start in two weeks.  She is upset that I'm working second shift.  I understand, we have two kids, (5 &amp; 8)  \n\n\nWe have enough money to last until my first pay check from this new job.  She knows this, I know this.  \n\n\nShe comes home today freaking out about bills and the fact that I need to work second shift.  We have done the math, and the math still says $&gt;0.   She's mad at me for taking so long to get a job.  I have been looking since middle January.  I didn't want to settle for a bad job if I didn't have to. She agreed, so I have been a little picky.  On the condition that if push comes to shove, I'll settle for anything. Well, next month we will not be able to pay all of our bills.  So Push came to shove, I went to a staffing agency and they got me the job paying 20/hr and its second shift.  This will increase our income by like 80 or 90 percent.  So money crisis over.  This has been a sore spot multiple times for us.  She simply doesn't care about what I do.  I accepted it.  \n\n\nI already have a job interview lined up next week for an IT analyst position. I just got another interview today.  She's already freaking out on me about the 2nd shift job and how long I haven't been working. Shes half sad, half mad. I'm kind of letting it slide, shes just stressed.  But I finally tell her I have an interview, I was initially expecting her to be excited, but after the mess she put me through, I was just expecting a \"cool\" or a \"good\".   \n\n\nShe instead starts asking me \"what will you be doing\" \"what is your job description\" and things along those lines.  Normal questions, but she's doing it in a  very belittling way.  On top of that, she has never asked me about my military job.  Not once in 17 years.  On top of that, I used to try to talk to her about it and she always shut me down.  I've long given up on her being interested in what I do.  She wants me to be happy, but she don't care about the details.    \n\n\nThen she says something along the lines of \"I need to see if you even get a shot at those jobs\" Now, I'm upset.  I was really excited about this job interview.  It seems like a perfect fit from the conversations I have had with the recruiter.  I have only worked on military systems that civilians don't get to work with and they have systems that no one outside their specific industry works with so they know they will have to train up anyone they hire.  It plays up my strengths and negates my weaknesses. (I told her that too).  I tell her I'm upset and she doubles down on the statement.    \n\n\nShe teaches, she doesn't understand anything I do in the army, she doesn't understand anything in IT.  And now she's saying she knew I would fail at finding a job and get stuck with something bad.  I feel like she has no faith in me and never has.  She doesn't care about me.  On top of that she crushed my joy at this interview.  (and yes I understand an interview means nothing, only the offer. It still makes you feel good about yourself though).  I have all kinds of anxiety and self esteem issues, and she just made them worse.    \n\n\nI guess one last thing, she has always worked as a part-time teacher.  She used to only work about 15 hours a week.  She wanted more hours and before I became a stay at home dad she started working about 30 hours/week.  Even though she could have made 30 or 40 percent more money elsewhere, she didn't want to work 40.  I was happy with this and so was she.  So now I guess I'm upset that I have  let her work a part-time job for near a decade while I brought home most of the money with no complaints. Now that I'm actually trying to do something I want she is being...\"whatever it is I just described\" about it.  \n\n\nI don't know what I want out of this post, I was just writing.",

I've been with my boyfriend for 4 months and lately i've been feeling really attracted to him. Thanks to my previous relationships, I always thought i was asexual or demisexual because I was never sexually into my partners. I told my current bf about the same and he always told me that physical intimacy is something he'd like for me to enjoy. But I've always been so against the idea of having s&amp;x. We do most things but s&amp;x just never sat right with me.\n\nAnyway, I was away for three weeks during christmas break and right after i got back, we was away on vacation for 6 weeks, so we've been in ldr for over 2 months. We're finally back in the city and only able to meet once every weekend (i'm a student and he has a full time job). Usually I would dread meeting him cause that meant making out with him, but now I can't stop thinking about him and i'm looking forward to meeting him sooner. I should spare the details but i'm no longer uncomfortable with the fact that he's sexually attracted to me. I find myself thinking of him way more than I'd like to accept. And i know this is normal for most people in serious relationships but I never imagined myself to fantasize about him this way. I'm feeling a little flustered. I think this reddit post is just my way of talking about it. Anyway, have a great day everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; maybe i'm falling in love with my boyfriend",

We were there for each other emotionally at a young age but as we grew we started to resent each other. I was a complete and total asshole to her as a teenager because she was the golden child and I was always being stepped on by family. She stopped having my back and I hated her for it. That was almost 10 years ago and I regret how I treated her then, and have since apologized for it. \n\nOur relationship was rocky going forward. I did whatever I could to treat her better and form a solid relationship with her. I always tried to call her (she hardly answered) send her gifts, chat with her daily, send her money, get her Ubers home when she didn’t have a way, I put her on my phone plan and only charge her half of what she actually owes. All for over 10 years. Through all of that she’s had a nasty, terrible attitude toward me and my husband. I never really talked about it because I felt guilt about how I treated her as a teen. I felt like I deserved that treatment. Even through my traumatic pregnancy and my severe depression she treated me shitty and wasn’t there for me.\n\nI should also mention if I don’t agree with her on everything then I’m the enemy.\n\nFast forward to now. She’s married to a man who speaks very little English and she got married to him very quickly. I’ve never met him but I trusted her judgement despite being worried about it. She’s never lived on her own before or been in such a committed relationship. We were talking about her wedding when she brought up she’s pregnant with his baby. She barely moved in with him for the first time the day before telling me and then tells me she had been trying to get pregnant. I don’t understand why she’s rushing all of this so quickly and it has me very worried for her. I let it eat at me for a few days until finally I told her how I felt. The explosion of hatred and defensive words that came out of her was astounding because I told her I was coming from a place of love and concern. She told me I have never supported her and I’ve never been there for her, especially now. She hates what I have to say and doesn’t care how I feel about it.\n\nDaggers to the heart. \n\nI have a baby myself. I was alone the whole time and I wanted to end my life because of the stress. She wasn’t there for me when I begged her to be. Now she wants me to be there for her? After spitting acid in my face? All those times I listened to her cry and treated her to something? All those late night calls, all those gifts I got her that she sold? All those times I invited her to where I’m living and she stepped on me the entire time? She’s rude and selfish and I don’t think she’s ready to care for a whole other life.\n\nMy heart can’t handle it anymore. I’m ready to let her go but I’m conflicted. \n\nTL;DR: sister is marrying a man she barely knows/ having his baby and I’m concerned for her but she hates what I have to say.",

        "text": " my 27M boyfriend and i have been dating for a little over 3 years. this is my longest relationship and most serious this is like my first real relationship so i don't know if this is normal. but he has been in many long-term relationships he was single for like 3 years before we started dating. When we first started dating, he would say things like remember we don't care what people think and I like that your weird i wouldn't like you if you weren't. within the last six months Hes become friends with guys whose girlfriends do like everything for them like all cooking cleaning. Hes been saying stuff like \" you're so weird\" (for having an app where i track my mood each day also was like you have a crazy number of apps what's your screen time like 9hrs a day?) \" you know normal girlfriends do this ... for their boyfriends\" \"you're so sketch\" (for me closing Instagram and putting my phone down when he comes and sits next to me) \"god i have to water and feed you like a plant\" (we literally planned on having a meal together). he asks me a question like should we add bananas to our cookie dough and i say no and he like gets upset calls me boring and says we just don't agree on anything anymore. we had lots of fights last summer because i worked two jobs and didn't spend enough time with him. he thinks i don't prioritize him but i do have to prioritize school before him and i do. i struggle with ADHD anxiety and depression and in the past, he was so caring and understanding. now its like he doesn't even care. he is not always like this, he is mostly like the kindest sweetest guy better than anyone ive ever met. I just want to get peoples opinion on whether i should try to talk to him about how he makes me feel and how or if its normal in long-term relationships for your partner to start to turn like this. he could just be done with me but hes said in the past during a fight like you need to tell me if you're not all in because youll be able to find someone but im getting old and wont be able to.\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend of over 3 years is starting to talk harshly to me and compare me to his friends girlfriends who are great and do a lot for their boyfriends but that's not me. How can i tell him how hes making me feel and get him to act like he used to or does this mean the relationship is basically over.",

        "text": "I (32F) moved internationally for work and am currently in a long-distance relationship with my long-term boyfriend (34M) while his current work contract finishes. \n\nLast summer, I became casual friends with two men (Sam - 60sM; Jack 41M) (more of this story in my post history if interested). It was a friendly relationship where we would make small chat, they would tell me ridiculous stories about shenanigans they would get up to in their past, and they also regularly protected me from unwanted sexual advances of other men in the area. My boyfriend always enjoyed hearing what ridiculous things they told me about and he felt comfortable knowing that these older men were watching out for my safety. It turned out that Jack lives on the same street as me and I regularly run into him in my daily life where we still exchange pleasantries.\n\nTonight on my way home from a ridiculously long day at work where I am dealing with too much bullshit, I stopped to get groceries. With my luck, when I finished my shopping, it was pissing down rain. I was soaking wet and miserable, about to go up the path to my house when my grocery bags ripped open sending all my food out across the pavement. At this exact moment, Jack was passing by on his bike. He slowed down and asked if I needed help and although I told him it was fine and to not worry about it, he came over to help me gather my shopping and take them up to my house. We got to the door and I was also greeted with the fact that my 4 month supply of dog food (over 50kg of kibble) had been delivered a day early and was now sitting in a melted cardboard box. At this point I am positive I looked like a soggy rat and on the verge of having a total meltdown. He calmly handed me food he was carrying, told me to go inside and that he would bring in the dog food for me and to not worry. \n\nAfter everything was in, we stood at the door (him on the outer doorstep, me inside the frame), I thanked him profusely telling him that I  owed him for his help. What happened next is still a blur to me and doesn't feel real. The next thing I knew he pressed up against me and kissed me. As quick as it happened was as quick as it ended as we both pulled away and he began to apologise. \"Shit. No. Fuck. No. What am I doing. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I am sorry. I am so sorry. No. I don't know why... No. Not like this. I can't.\" In his stunned state, he scrambled back to the street and just ran off down the street (leaving his bike behind; which he must have come back for later as it was gone by the morning).\n\nI called my boyfriend after I got things unpacked, dried off, and tried to personally process what had just happened. I told him about the whole situation still finding it a bit strange and unbelievable and saying he was \\_mad\\_ would be an understatement. He is furious. He is demanding that I move to a different neighbourhood because I shouldn't live near Jack. He is demanding that I press charges against him for sexual harassment/assault. And now we are fighting about this situation. I can understand why he is upset - I would not be happy either if the situation were reversed. However, I think it's incredibly unreasonable to expect me to uproot my entire life because of this strange situation. I also don't think pressing charges is necessary - should this interaction have happened and was it consensual? No. Mistakes may have been made but I think that Jack realised this in the moment immediately too. Due to the high levels of emotions involved right now, I am giving my boyfriend space to cool off (this happened on Monday) but the stance he has left it at was that if I don't take action against Jack/to relocate far away to a new neighbourhood, then that's the end for us because clearly I have ulterior motives wanting to stay near Jack. \n\nI don't really know what to do. I do not think I should have to move from a great house and a great neighbourhood because of this. Jack and I were always platonic. I think a mistake was made on his end and that neither of our lives should be disrupted because of it. Am I being too lenient though? I am a bit upset since it just makes me wonder whether the basis of my relationship with Jack was only ever out of sexual desire for me on his end so I feel betrayed but I'm not upset at the actual action. Do I listen to my boyfriend and take action and move or should he just chill a little? \n\nNote: I normally see Jack daily (sometimes twice a day) in passing on the street but I have not seen him since this happened. \n\nTLDR: My (32F) neighbour (41M) spontaneously kissed me after helping me out when I was in need. He apologised and ran off into the night and I haven't seen him since. My boyfriend (34M) is furious and is giving me an ultimatum of press charges/move to a new neighbourhood or else he will leave.",

He had showed some interest/hints that he could be interested in me not to mention I enjoy his company a lot. The night was fun but there were a lot of revelations that surprised me, but also I’m not surprised what alcohol can do to you. \n\n1- he was very affectionate and touchy towards me (cute-non creepy way) &amp; sat next to me the entire time. He was giving me attention and also socializing with my friends and it was great. \n\n2- At some point I sobered up a little from drinking water in between the night, while he was tipsy-close to drunk he pulled me to the dance floor and danced with me (he put his hands on my waist and swayed me) while singing lyrics to me and waffling my fingers. It was pretty intimate while being waved not gunna lie. \n\n3- At some point he slept in the bar, and leaned on me the entire time and was cuddling with me and kept looking me in the eyes &amp; whispering drunken things, it was funny because my sober friends thought we’re dating (which we are not).\n\n4- At the end of the night after he slept in the car and it was time for him to go home, he looked at me and opened his arms wide, hugged me amorously for like a good few seconds \n\n5- He checked up on my the following morning on how am feeling during my hangover, we chatted a little and that’s it. I didn’t want to text him too much to avoid scaring him/making it awkward. He also said he didn’t remember much of last night, but he did recall snippets but never mentioned the affectionate stuff he did with me. \n\nWe also don’t text regularly as we became friends in this long event we worked in so we saw each other/ spent time more in person. \n\nMmm Now I feel like he is avoiding me, his sister (which I’m friends with too and doesn’t know about our drunken night out) planned to do a hangout in the weekend but she told me that he said he is busy and will be out of town. \n\nI’m concerned if I’m ever I’m gunna see him again cause I just really like and want to get to know him more and don’t wanna rush things. I need advice I don’t know what to do in this situation and if I’m overthinking this or not. \n\nI cant stop thinking of him, I’ve been crying for a few days cause I got so depressed and emotional after my hangover. \n\nTL;DR: I feel like a friend that I also like is avoiding me after a night of drinking and I don’t know if I’m overthinking it or not.",

        "text": "All right, so, me and my girlfriend have been going out for about 8 months. After a month in I sat her down and had a discussion about my autism and how it would affect how I act and see things in our relationship. I thought it would be a good idea for her to have a complete understanding. One of the things I spoke about is how I don't like to mask (masking is when an autistic person tries their hardest to act \"normal\", consistent eye contact, not stimming, understand idioms and sarcasm etc, etc,) Because it is stressful and puts unnecessary strain on me.\n\nUp until now, everything has been as close to perfect as possible. No fights, no problems, just a good comfortable relationship. And with my autism, she has been more than understanding. That was until last week. Last week was pretty stressful for both of us. I had some family problems coupled with college work, and she had a shitty time at her job plus still had to do college work as well.  However last Friday night was supposed to be the night we forgot all that, we were supposed to have a good dinner at our favorite Mexican place, and go see the puss in boots movie because I hadn't seen it yet.\n\nBefore I move on to the next part I would like to tell you the biggest rule that I gave her. Don't yell at me.\n\nI'm not saying she couldn't get angry, or that she couldn't argue, but she could not yell or shout at me at all. Due to past trauma with my mother that I won't get into, it would be an immediate call-off. The moment she yelled is the moment I'm gone.\n\nSo we get to the restaurant and everything is going well. We're talking and laughing about our shitty weeks, talking about video games we want to play together later. It all ends when we sit at our table. Everything just becomes too much. Too many people, too much noise, too many things going on at once. I'm having sensory overload and it's causing my anxiety to skyrocket. My girlfriend catches on pretty quickly, orders a tea for me and immediately begins trying to calm me down. This isn't the first time I've panicked like this in front of her and she kind of new what to do. However this time I just wanted to leave and get out of there. However I guess my girlfriend was set on having a nice, uneventful night. I calmed down a bit and we carried on. The anxiety is still there but I can deal with it by stimming and other things I do to calm down. I notice some people are looking at me weirdly which only adds to it. Again it begins to become too much and I start begging her for us to just leave. After a couple of minutes of arguing back and forth, she eventually yells at me \"Why can't you just act f\\*cking normal?\" \n\nIt was the type of yelling I was all too familiar with, one where it can be overlooked in the noise of a crowd but is very evident to the person you're yelling at.\n\nI was stunned, completely stunned, out of small arguments she had never really been seriously angry with me. She also seemed to realize rather quickly what she had just said as she immediately went into apologies. But I just stood up and left, leaving some money so she could pay for the food I had ordered.  She didn't follow me, either because she was too stunned or she knew it wouldn't make any difference.\n\nI called my brother and he took me home. She hadn't text me so I just went to bed and cried myself to sleep. The next morning there was a whole slew of texts from her. You're generic, \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, I was just angry and stressed, please forgive me, let's talk about this.\" I didn't respond. I wasn't stupid, I know it was just out of stress and angry I've done similar things in the past with other people. But in my opinion anger doesn't just make you say random hurtful things, anger just removes the filter. \n\nHad she always had this belief? All those times we were in public and I wasn't acting \"normal\" was she constantly looking around because she was embarrassed of me? Does she secretly hate the way I talk, my stimming, my hyper fixations, my sensitivity, if so why is she even with me? Maybe I'm being irrational and my insecurities are getting the best of me.\n\nI got a few texts from a mutual friend earlier today. They're telling me that I need to see my girlfriend and that she's inconsolable and she feels really guilty. And everything in my body wants to do it, wants to just run back to her and just let it go. But I've done that before with others and it's always ended badly. I don't want to compromise my own feelings for others anymore. I want, no, I need to put myself first and I can't go back to a person who screwed up just because they feel bad that they screwed up. In the back of my mind, there is this aching fear that if I go back she's just going to do it again later. \n\nCan you guy's help me? What should I do? was this just a one-off thing because of her stressful life or did her stressful life just bring how she really feels out of her?\n\nTLDR My girlfriend got mad at me while I was having a panic attack and it's threatening to ruin our relationship.",

        "text": "I’m 18(f), senior in HS, graduating soon and I broke up with my ex about about a year and a half ago. I try not to dwell on it, but I feel like I’ll regret not being able to call him a friend by the time we graduate. The thought of my last memories with him being arguments is what I want to change. (I don’t want to be friends that frequently talk to each other nor do I want to get back together with him. I just want to hash things out before it’s too late.)\n\n\nI originally started to like him in middle school and consider him my first love. We began to date when we were freshman, broke up the beginning of our junior year.(we did take a break during covid but not for reasons within the relationship and didn’t date anyone else and remained friends until half way through out sophomore year. I was also the one that called it off)\n\nWe had a healthy relationship but it ended with family problems on his side(his parents being very picky about who he dates if at all) and another girl coming into his life. I consider him to have been a cheater because he was talking to this girl while we were still together for a couple weeks before his family became involved. He also lied when I asked for truth about the situation. \n\nHaving a year to think it through, I’ve decided that I can forgive everything. Even though he’s brought pain to me intentionally and unintentionally, the 2 years that I considered him the one for me will always outweigh the bad at the very end. Forgetting is a different story. That’s why I no longer wish for us to be together, but I want to reach out to him one last time before it’s over to apologize for the words I’ve said when being overwhelmed with a situation that wasn’t our fault and give him a chance to voice his regrets (if he wishes to.) I’m conflicted about my decision because from friends, I’ve received mixed opinions.\n\nTL;DR: We’re both about to graduate in high school. We broke up because of family issues and his interest in someone else. I don’t wish to get back together with him but since I consider him my first love, I want to hash things out before we potentially never meet again.",

He drove us everywhere and stuff, and my place is a bit farther from the things we went to during the day, so that was quite a bit of driving.

I feel like before I settled for breadcrumbs, I'd literally think so highly of someone if they were consistent with me and didn't flake on dates or ghost. I've finally raised my standards. I don't know if I'll continue talking to the guy from this weekend or if we'll hangout sometime again since we live in 2 different states now, but I'm lowkey put off by people on dating apps. I'm just like \"sure they seem nice, but will they put as much effort as he did for what was technically a 2nd date?\" I know I sound really ridiculous right now, any thoughts? I feel dumb\n\ntl;dr: Met guy for 2nd time and spent entire weekend with him. He put in a lot of effort to see me and hangout with me and it's put me off to talking to people on dating apps. Help?",

        "text": "My gf and I have dated for 6 months. It has been a good relationship thus far. She has been very transparent with me, voluntarily, about her past. One of the guys she has mentioned was someone she had sex with a couple of times a couple of years ago. She told me that there was really nothing emotional between them, all he ever was to her was a dick appointment. And eventually, she wanted nothing to do with him and blocked him on everything except his number.\n\nWell, this guy has recently been persistent in trying to get back with her and texting her asking her out. She never responds and she will often show me and we both laugh at how desperate he is and move on with our day. \n\nHe ended up reaching out again and sent her a “genuine” text congratulating her for graduating. My gf screenshots it and sends it to me and it’s funny. We end up hanging out a couple days later and I ask her about the text and she shows me. The guy is asking her what she does for work now and basic catch-up stuff and she responds (too friendly for my liking since she was using “!!”). But no flirting is happening and she is merely answering his questions.\n\nUltimately, he sends a voice memo asking her out and she responds “I have dinner plans this weekend”. I get a bit upset for a couple reasons. Why is she bothering to respond to a guy who is obviously trying to get in her pants? And why did she not feel the need to mention me / boyfriend at all?\n\nShe could tell I didn’t like that she was responding and then offered to block. But I let the emotions get the best of me and got angry at her for even responding to him in the first place and not mentioning me.\n\nShe then proceeds to say I’m “insecure” and “controlling” and she has the right to be polite and respond. And that she didn’t mention me because there was no point since he is so irrelevant and it just matters she said no.\n\nWe’re tense now and not sure what to do. She is the type to never really get jealous or insecure of me - so maybe I am not being fair by giving her the same treatment? Any advice?\n\nTLDR: Gf was texting back a past “friends with benefits” who has been trying to reconnect for months. She didn’t hide the convo from me and was very transparent but I got upset she was responding to him in the first place and didn’t even mention me when he asked her out. She said I’m being controlling and insecure. Not sure what to do. Advice?",

However there were a lot of issues after the engagement such as her being toxic and manipulative as well as her family so there is some good that came out of this break up but I still feel sad and find myself having a hard time to accept that it is truly over. Another reason I am having such a hard time is because I have just had a string of relationships in a row within only just the last year that have ended unpleasantly and it had already taken a toll on me mentally but now with this one it stings much more because it was an engagement and not just dating. I know I am only 26 and that's not really that old but I am just so mentally drained from having to go through this over and over again and feel like I just don't have it in me to try again. \n\nTL:DR My engagement broke off and am feeling depressed and hopeless.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I’m sorry if this isn’t the right sub to post in but I’ve had a hard time figuring out where I can get some advice.\nI haven’t been single since I got into my first relationship at 15. My first relationship was 2 and a half years and it was the best first relationship I could have ever asked for. I broke up with him  after doing 6 months long distance after I had to move because we were young and I felt like I was responsible for his well-being and education. I met my next boyfriend while I was with my first boyfriend and he very quickly fell for me. We were friends and I never cheated on my first boyfriend with him, but after I broke up with boyfriend he thought that it was go time and that I had broken up with my boyfriend to be with him. He started telling everyone that we were dating and i just kinda complied (young and stupid and not good at saying no). We were together for a little under a year. When I was finally able to break up with him I then regrettably got into another relationship pretty fast after that was very rocky for a little more than half a year. He ended up breaking up with me which I took very hard because it was the first time I had really experienced rejection. I think I was more heartbroken about not being desired by him than actually not being with him. I decided that I wanted to be single after that but then after two months met my last boyfriend. It was love at first sight and I don’t regret dating him one bit, but it didn’t work out. We were together for 2 and a half years, lived together for a year. I recently broke up with him and now I’m scared of falling back into the trap of rushing into a new relationship. I’m terrified of being alone and not having a person that’s my person that I can talk to about anything. At the same time I think it’s time for me to try being independent and single but how do I break the evil cycle and learn to be by myself. \n\nTLDR; I have bounced between relationships since I was 15 how do I break the cycle and learn to be comfortable being alone?",

        "text": "tldr: been seeing someone for 3 months who is sadly going through a bad mental health crisis. he doesn’t want to lose me, but i don’t want to burden him and am unsure how to navigate this time period while we’re on a “break.” \n\nhi all, i wish i could keep this short but have a hard time not over explaining. for the last 3ish months i’ve (24f) been seeing someone (25m) and he is honestly great. we had a long talk at the end of january, where he voiced that i was a girl that he knew was good for him, but was scared of getting hurt. it brought us a lot closer. and from then on we were able to be so open with each. even though he’s convinced he’s bad at communicating, he did such a damn good job with me. there was constant progress. \n\nin mid february he came over and fully vented about how he felt like his mental health wasn’t getting better and while he knows he’s burnt out from his job, he’s struggling with what to do and is so unhappy. he thinks he needs to move as the solution. i told him that’s his call, but the real issue lies with his job and not if he’s not quitting, then he’s going to be miserable elsewhere. he works 12 hour days, in the entertainment industry, basically 7 days a week if that gives a better idea of how little time he has to live his life. during our convo he told me he wanted to take the next step (as in be in a official relationship) but needs to figure this out first, to which i agreed and told him that if i’m ready when he isn’t, we’ll have to talk about. he doesn’t confide in really anyone, but i’m glad he felt that he could come to me.  \n\nover the next few weeks, i truly saw how his personality shifted from our first date to now, but i was trying to be supportive when he wanted me to be. i got laid off last week, and i didn’t tell him till i saw him in the evening. the way he was there for me, dropped everything he had to do, and stayed with me really meant a lot to me. it solidified how much he cared. i knew i wanted to be exclusive with this guy. i told him the next day over text how i was feeling and we should talk about it in a few days to give him time to process. \n\nwell, he came over sunday and he wants to truly be with me but knows that he can’t give his 100% when he’s already unhappy. he was crying (a lot) saying he feels really overwhelmed w life and knows he’s about to hit his breaking point but doesn’t want to drag me down with him/wouldn’t be fair to me because he wouldn’t treat me how i deserve to be treated. i told him he needs to tell me what’s best for him to do, and he cried some more, saying he needs a break from everything and everyone because it’s all adding to his stress instead of making him happy like it should. it was honestly heartbreaking to see. and i cried. a lot. i haven’t felt this way about someone in a few years. he kept stressing that he refuses to let things just go back to how it was, because it wouldn’t be fair to me to settle when i want more. i said some silly things about how he’s probably going to go date another girl in two weeks (it’s my own past trauma) and that it’s hard to feel that he cared. which both comments hurt him a lot, and he told me if it was about other people he would’ve just done this over the phone and not put basically the only ounce of emotional effort he has into me. i told him i’m not mad, just feeling triggered but i completely understand. and that it feels like bad timing and he said the same. he doesn’t want us to cut each other off unless it hurts me, because he does see me in his future but he doesn’t expect me to wait on him. \n\nseeing him cry as we walked away from each other hurt so bad. we texted that night saying we don’t want to lose each other and that he knows he has a lot of issues and changes he needs to face but it’ll be hard. we’ve sent one text to each other each day since, but he’s on a work trip which we rarely ever talk on. i texted back last night that i just need a few days of going off the grid while my mom visits. and i don’t think he’d give himself space that i know he needs unless i initiate it. \n\ni like him so much, and i know i can’t just be hopeful things will work out… especially anytime soon. i know i can’t “wait” but i also am never the type to hop back into dating so i know i need to stay busy on my own while stuffing my face in job searching. \n\ni truly believe he’s being sincere and neither of us wants this to be the end. but i really am looking for some support or guidance on how to navigate this situation from anyone who’s been on either side. i feel so empty and helpless. i know i can’t be his therapist and he even said he doesn’t want to be dependent on me for help. it’s just so damn hard.",
