        "text": "Taylor Sheridan wrote a mostly [amazing script for Sciario](https://indiegroundfilms.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/sicario-by-taylor-sheridan.pdf) but if Denis Villeneuve had stuck with the ending, the movie would have been so much worse. In Sheridan's script, Alejandro spares Fausto Alarcón's (the Sonora drug lord) children and then toys with Fausto by making him choose who dies between his wife and himself. Fausto chooses his wife but Alejandro kills him anyway and spares her. It makes out Alejandro to be a much more benevolent anti-hero rather than the single-focused revenge driven killer that the movie ends up portraying. The scene also paints Fausto as a more cartoonish villain, juxtaposing the American-backed lesser evil versus the selfish Mexican drug boss.\n\nAnother part of the ending that was changed was Alejandro's final confrontation with Kate. Alejandro seems to be in her apartment for no real reason other than to tell her to leave town. He forcibly lifts up her shirt, baring her breasts, just to comment on the bruises he gave her when he shot her kevlar. The scene ends with Kate frantically searching her place for Alejandro as he mysteriously vanishes, leaving Kate humiliated and without agency. The movie ending with Kate pointing a gun at Alejandro, something he had specifically told her not to do during the tunnel raid, gives her the slightest bit of defiant agency even with the subsequent acceptance of her reality when she decides not to kill him.\n\nThe more overt action movie featuring the killer with a heart of gold really comes out in the sequel, Sicario: Day of the Soldado, which was also written by Taylor Sheridan but not directed by Denis Villeneuve.",

A lot of Hitchcock’s techniques in particular. \n\nThis got me thinking. Should a film receive critical praise for referencing films it was inspired by? Or is this almost pandering to an audience, resting on the successful tropes of films before it?\n\nTarantino’s films are largely meta-references to his favourite genres - let’s take Jackie Brown as an example. Jackie Brown is another great movie, it’s appeal and character is owed to the pastiche of the Blaxploitation film, and how Tarantino was able to reference its nuances with such reverence and homage. But are we not just watching Tarantino imitate a Foxy Brown film? Is Reservoir Dogs not an imitation of City on Fire?\n\nI don’t necessarily have a horse in this race - I love most of Tarantino’s films and loved Blow Out also. Although I’ve always considered the critique of referencing being imitation instead of innovation, and wanted to hear everyone’s thoughts on the matter.",

The amount of time she was in the water freeing him, she would have been dead. It removes just how impactful the cold water is, if you have people wading in it for what seems forever and showing little effect.",

I loved the style of both movies and particularly the energy of it and a emotional affecting form of melancholy. It feels like a dream. Sweet and dark. It's hard to describe exactly what struck a chord with me  but i'll try to explain what I mean by similar.  I'm a sucker for whimsical and melancholy love stories that are grounded in reality but have their head slightly in the clouds. The fairy-tale like story of Chungking, paired with the beautiful colouring/cinematography and dialogue so rich that every other line is a profound quotable are what make this film a masterpiece to me. The overarching theme of  love and the bittersweet ending sealed the deal even more.  I was like, why am I crying? And it’s because my feelings for this movie run so deep –– I’m crying not about the movie, I’m crying because I’m just so happy to love a movie this much \n\nCould you name movies with a similar style and mastery? Doesn't need to be necessarily Asian movies. But I'm not looking for bleak or depressing movies. Thank you in advance!",

        "text": "One of the best scenes in the movie is when Chef Slowick pulls Tyler into the kitchen to cook a dish. Tyler then shows absolute ineptitude in even the most basic parts of professional cooking. He has his heat way too high. He throws everything into the pan at the same time. He keeps burning himself when handling the equipment. He makes a dish that's lamb with leeks and shallots. Those 3 things go together. It's not amazing cooking but with those ingredients and a few spices you can definitely make something that tastes good. He, even with all of his knowledge, messes it up. Scorched veggies, undercooked meat, no seasoning. Once finished, Slowick insults the dish and Tyler and then whispers something to Tyler that the audience doesn't hear. Tyler then takes off his jacket, and as we find out in a later scene, hangs himself. So the question is: What did Slowick say to Tyler?\n\nI don't believe that Slowick told Tyler to kill himself. As Tyler respects the chef and views him as his mentor he would do as he's told. Slowick orders around his cooks and gives them commands. And Tyler, as demonstrated, is no cook.\n\nI don't think Slowick insulted Tyler either. If he was going to humiliate him he could do that out loud. He had been passive aggressively making comments while he was cooking and then went into full-blown insults after tasting the dish. It wasn't some sort of final twist of the knife.\n\nI think Slowick asked Tyler to leave. All Tyler cared about was trying the menu. He was gluttonously indulging in every dish even when death and violence was occuring around him. To be asked to leave in the middle of the dinner broke his spirit. He was the only person who knew everyone would die there. His last ditch effort to still be part of the dinner was to kill himself while there, so as to die with everyone else, as the end of the menu would have been.",

        "text": "i'm mostly speaking in generalities here, but it seems like the violence &amp; sex were turned way up during this time period. European cinema was especially edgy with the New French Extremity &amp; Dogme 95 movements (but one could single out Lars Von Trier alone with *Dancer in the Dark* and especially *Antichrist*) which stirred up so much controversy and set the tone for the entire decade of film making. things like gender &amp; cultural representation also regressed in comparison to the 90's (not that the 90's was super PC either). [The Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBxgEIcMB6o) goes more in-depth here with how sexist the era was as a whole. it makes you wonder if all the social justice &amp; representation being demanded in media now was a direct response to the edgy 2000's (a film like [Sextet](https://vimeo.com/38306682) could never be made nowadays. Though it wasn't just Europe putting out edgy stuff, Japan kicked off the decade with the infamous Battle Royale, and Hollywood decided this was going to be the era of torture porn with movies like The Passion of the Christ, The Saw &amp; Hostel film franchises, Hard Candy and the like. They even upped the sex factor considerably with controversial films like Ken Park and Hounddog (which had a then 12-year Dakota Fanning raped on screen). if I were to pick the ultimate edgy 2000's film it would undoubtedly be the infamous *Irreversible* though\n\n\n\n\nwhat was it about this era that turned the violence &amp; sex up to 11? and do you think the PC landcape of filmmaking we are in now is a direct response to the 2000's?",

        "text": "I watched the film in IMAX 3D because my father asked me to join him.\n\nYou don't understand. My father *never* watches movies, within or without the cinema. I don't know if the unknowable forces that compelled him to invite me to the cinema that day can be credited directly to Cameron, but our consumption certainly factored into his success. For that, I am moderately ashamed.\n\nAvatar 2 returns us to Pandora after a decade in order to focus on Jake Sully, the most mediocre white man on this side of the planet. Sully is a spectacularly horrible father. He runs his family like he's trying to DIY a discount USMC bootcamp. His sons end their sentences with \"over\" and reply with \"yessir\". Sully doesn't communicate, no, he gives *orders*. That's what a Father ^TM does.\n\nHis wife Neytiri tells him to stop running away from problems at the very beginning of the film, but Sully was not listening. Sully does a lot of Not Listening in the film, actually — he interrupts Neytiri in nearly every interaction they have with the water tribe's leaders, he constantly undermines her concerns, he shuts down her disagreements, and he overrides her pleas to stay with her tribe. Because ~~we wouldn't have a 3h movie otherwise~~ pfft, what could she possibly know about being a Father ^TM ? A Father ^TM protects his family (this is, I shit you not, a direct quote). How could she *possibly* understand? \n\nWhat Neytiri needs is a man to sternly tell her what to do. What Sully needs is a magical underwater tree to tell him that he, in fact, cannot run away from his problems — not his wife, who said that from the start, mind you. Then the film ends, ready to feed straight into *Avatar 3*.\n\nSully obstinately refusing to listen to Neytiri is not much of a problem in of itself — characters can grow, after all — except when it carries on for *3 hours* and no reason is given for it beyond the filmmakers perhaps thinking it's just Not A Big Deal that this white militaristic man continually tramples over all the indigenous blue people in the movie, and the film bends over backwards to make you see him as the *hero*.\n\nWhen did Sully stop listening to Neytiri? She was his guide to the Na'vi, she taught him to respect Eywa, she gave him voice by translating for him to her tribe. Now that she's been *wifed* and domesticated however, she has less of an influence on the plot than her sons.\n\nIn *Avatar 1*, one major strength was the epic scale of it all — during the climactic insurgency war, Eywa responded with beasts stampeding on the ground and flying beasts assaulting the Earth-side aerial forces in the air. Neytiri kills the main villain with an arrow through his windshield. \n\nIn *Avatar 2*, we have gone from entire battalions of fauna to a singular, outcast whale. The major climactic fight takes place in the form underwater hand-to-hand combat between Sully and Quaritch. Oh, and Neytiri holds her foster son hostage, where in every single preceding scene they have been on such good terms that she encourages her children to play with him. That scene didn't read to me like a triumph of Neytiri's will, it read like we needed the savage primitive native woman to hold a white boy in dreadlocks hostage, because Sully can't/won't do it. Perhaps a more enlightened viewer than I can find another way to interpret this scene, but it's remarkably difficult to do so when I'm aware of how the Na'vi are coded and all the colonialist/imperialist subtext that Cameron is trying (poorly) to deliver.\n\nNeytiri is doing a Na’vi accent still. Only half her children do, the other half sound like Americans. This difference is never explained, recognised, or addressed in the movie. Perhaps accent training was part of their bootleg USMC bootcamp schedule.\n\nAlso, if the sentient planet could command the fauna in *Avatar 1* to fight back against the invading colonisers, why did Eywa allow Quaritch to tame a flying beast in *Avatar 2*? The more you think about this movie the less it makes sense, and many parts cheapen the first movie when you interpret them in conjunction. Is Quaritch's particular beast, in fact, *okay* with being used to further Quaritch's colonising ambitions? Or does Eywa just hand out personal rides to blue-bodied individuals like free Halloween candy now?\n\nKiri is Cameron's Avatar’s *Avatar*. She’s the messiah — seriously, the allegory is pathetically, thinly veiled; she is born of virgin birth, she has magical superpowers, and she is basically her parent reincarnated (this could be me over-reading into the casting choice, except it's really, really hard to ignore). Yet, over its *3h of runtime* the movie doesn't really do anything super significant with her superpowers. It's all buildup for *Avatar 3*, one might say, except I struggle to understand why a *3h-long movie* can't have payoff for an obvious Chekov's gun waiting to be fired.\n\nI do not understand why they had to resurrect Quaritch, the first movie’s primary antagonist, into a Na’vi body. There weren’t any interesting discussions of what it means to be a clone, or heir, or anything, or changes in perspective, really — there doesn’t need to be, of course, but then why bring him back specifically? He just somehow shows back up, and begins obsessing over Sully, right on cue — Sully, the most mediocre white man with poor parenting skills on this side of Pandora.\n\nIn *Avatar 1*, Earth was motivated by capitalist greed for unobtanium, so they invaded with the force of the USMC (?) and uprooted the locals who were blocking the ore veins. Okay, cool. Quaritch is greedy people, I can get that.\n\nIn *Avatar 2*, Earth is motivated by coloniser greed for more *lebensraum*, so they try to take down local resistance leader Sully who is interfering with their plans. Sully *runs away*. He abandons his leadership position, he moves to a new town, he cuts his ties to the resistance and brings his whole family into hiding. Okay, cool. Quaritch is... super obsessed with Sully, so he hunts Sully down on a bunch of illegal whaling boats.\n\nSeriously, what are the stakes in this? How did we downgrade from \"Sully fights for the independence of Pandora\" to \"Sully fights Quaritch, his number one hater\"?\n\nThere’s a new resistance leader now. Why not go after him? Why chase Sully, who has no influence and no power left? Why’re you so obsessed, man? Quaritch jumps on an illegal whaling boat and threatens them, so they listen and expand their operations into village-burning and Na'vi fighting at the drop of a hat. Why’s this whaling boat so ridiculously armed? If y’all’s are just fishing for plus-sized whales, how are y'all's armed to the teeth with sufficient firepower to burn down entire coastal villages?\n\nThe water tribe is nowhere to be seen towards the end of the climactic fight. What Eywa, sentient intelligent planet, *really* needed, was a white man cosplaying as a native fighting for her freedom against another white man cosplaying as a native, because pfft what would this primitive blue planet *possibly* know about Freedom ^TM ? Even in the first movie, Eywa didn't proactively respond to the invaders — she needed to be told what to do via Sully's prayers.\n\n*Avatar 2* features paper thin motivations and horrible characterisation. It features spectacle, but I don't know if it *needed* to happen on Pandora to deliver its message — It just *happened* to happen on Pandora. \n\nI worry what to think about the sort of cultural hegemony we live under, when a movie about a horrible Father ^TM horribly parenting for 3h sells for &gt;US$2B at the box office. In a way, my writing a lot of words on this movie is yet a further waste of my time, when I could be watching and learning to critique better movies instead.\n\nThis is a selfishly cathartic experience, though, and I thank you for your time reading.\n\nIn the end my father and I both agreed the movie was unenjoyable, which says *something*. I don't know what, though, I need a magical underwater tree to tell me.",

        "text": "I finally watched Women Talking at a local theater and loved it. It's a movie carried by its performances and I wasn't a huge fan of other aspects like the editing. Much of the weight of this movie is put on the characters, so I'll mostly be speaking about them. \n\nAs a man, I can't say much about what it's like to be a woman. But as someone who was a victim of sexual assault and works in an industry that's 70 percent women, the movie resonated with me, and I related to August the most. \n\nIn a story filled with fear and hesitation, I'm glad that the two points of hope were depicted so well: August's new form of masculinity and the journey the women take on at the end of the movie. \n\nI learned so much when going out for drinks with coworkers by just shutting up and listening. Even if they talked about something about The Bachelor (not all women watch reality TV, but a lot of the women in my industry do), I always enjoyed listening to the conversation because I would blend into the group and learn how they saw situations and how they might judge them differently. In a way, I have felt like August taking minutes. \n\nBut the more relevant and meaningful conversations I've listened to are about their dating experiences, relationships with men, and how *every* woman has a story. And with each of those stories come very different responses to the incidents. Some are still dealing with the fallout, some respond by blaming themselves, some are stone-faced talking about it, and others have trouble even thinking about their trauma. Like August in the story, I've felt varied reactions to my presence in those conversations as well. Hostility when asking me why I was there or sarcastic jokes about me not caring at my expense, confused pleading to explain how a man could do something terrible, or genuine questions asking if there was hope for current or future men. \n\nAnother story beat I resonated with was August's nature, seemingly coming from his mother. While his father is barely discussed, his mother is in this almost saint-like status as someone who speaks truth-to-power against the current systems. On another personal note, a lot of my feminist education came from my mother, who despite being a socially conservative Catholic woman, was very progressive and pushed me toward these social justice causes. Most of the men I've met who hold feminist views usually come from wanting to make a better world for a woman in their life that they care about. Whether it's their mother, daughter, sister, wife, or friend, that's usually the main spark that inspired their stances. \n\nThe final scenes in the movie as the women prepare to leave the colony were very emotional, because the larger allegory for gender relationships felt very present. From August and Ona seemingly representing that the strongest sign of love can be acceptance that you can not control someone, to August being left as a small sign of hope that the older boys can still be taught better than their fathers, to the women setting on a long and unsure journey with nothing more than hope and a prayer. \n\nI'm personally a big fan of play-like films that have characters who portray idealistic versions of people over more realistic characters, so I thought it was engrossing. It reminded me of the other great bottle movies like One Night In Miami, 12 Angry Men, and Glengarry Glen Ross. \n\nTL;DR - I thought Women Talking was great. My favorite character was the only man.",

It was never a \"no brainer\" piece of pop entertainment. Unlike most of the other big productions of the year, it is neither a sequel nor the launching point of a series of sequels. It is not based on a comic book. It was not designed to spawn a vast array of toys, merchandising, video games and theme-park attractions. It is an earnest and heartfelt work. But the same voices that decry the formulaic commercialism of mainstream Hollywood product do not seem to applaud the studio heads who had the courage to back this unusual film.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, Titanic is an easy target, by the nature of the subject itself, that great monument to the folly of arrogant confidence. But believe me, I have never felt arrogance or certainty on this project. Quite the opposite. It has been a nerve-racking, terrifying ride. The budget overages threatened to consume our very sanity; the scope of the thing was overwhelming. But something kept us going--the studio heads, myself, the crew. We knew we had a chance to do something special, and those chances don't come along often.\n\nThis gets to the heart of why Cameron is so successful. He tries to do ordinary things extraordinarily well, and he fights hard for them. He gets studios to back projects they wouldn't ordinarily back. And he makes films that are \"earnest and heartfelt\", not laden with irony, quips, or meta-references. As someone else put it on reddit, his films have \"huge normie energy.\" They appeal across boundaries. \n\nWe saw it with *Titanic*, we saw it with *Avatar*, and now we've seen it again. \n\nP.S. Cameron's defense of his work ran just after [a feature story](https://time.com/vault/issue/1997-12-08/spread/92/) about how the film was unlikely to make back it's massive budget, and a [hilariously negative review](https://time.com/3833825/titanic-movie-review/) from Richard Corliss that spends its time calling Kate Winslet \"bulky\" yet \"ravishingly ravaged.\"",

        "text": "It's hard to review films like this I think. A bit like Tree of Life, they're more like streams of consciousness: an experience of feelings and images. So to try put it into regular words doesn't really sum it up. They're indescribable, and is personal to everyone who watches it. But here's an attempt at some words.\n\nBabylon is a film for the ages, of life and the journeys we all go on, in our careers and our personal lives. Change and being stuck. The world passing us by. It's an ode to cinema and life itself, the ebbs and flows. The ending sequence points to the art of film completely. About the birth and circular flow of film and the world, and the passion that comes for film, almost on the verge of madness. To dedicate onself completely to film as if all the emotions and questions can be found on that screen, in the ring of light shining up there. Of course there's some weird, crazy stuff in there, surreal stuff, but that's just like life at times right?\n\nIt's sad in a way how it's been received, and how the box office has been, but for anyone whose ever been mad about film I think it speaks to them. It speaks from Chazelle's soul and the love he has for the 'movies'. This is a film for films, films within films and films dedicated to films (wow I've said films a lot).\n\nA swansong",

Being constantly pushed over the edge and having to choose between getting his hands dirty or returning to the office, Jake had no choice. The wolf analogy makes sense for Alonzo, but for Jake, it is nonsense and only a temporary pain-killer that will eventually get him killed. After the raid, Jake refused to take the money, knowing that its legally and morally wrong.***\n\n ***Nevertheless, he found himself in the middle of a vicious circle. His morals and personal code of ethics prevented him from moving forward in this uncalled-for madness by Alonzo. At this point, Alonzo casually threw him for the gang to kill him, but he was let go by them for some reason. Finally, fed up with all this, he walked right into the belly of the beast, Alonzo's crib, instead of running home to his wife and daughter, which says more about him as a genuinely courageous individual. Ultimately, the rookie proved there was no need to get his hands dirty to bring justice and save his life. Eventually, the Mexicans didn't kill him because he saved their cousin girl from being raped earlier that day. Moreover, his courage to take down the rogue Alonzo, who was abusing the people, kept him from being killed in the hood.***",

        "text": "“Politics is like a nightclub. It’s a party with the devil. They’re all there together, with lights beaming into their faces, with strobes in the dark. It’s flashing; they’ve lost their bearings. They lose their balance, their memory. They lose everything, their common sense. They arrive there and no longer leave. There’s no more day, no more night. There’s no more time. That’s politics: people in the dark who don’t even look at each other anymore.”\n\n**Pacifiction** was one of the official selections of the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, along with the more popular Triangle of Sadness (the eventual Palme d’Or winner) and the masterpiece **Decision to Leave.** It’s an intentional, deliberate film that likely won’t be popular with most moviegoers. The portmanteau title, Pacifiction, alludes to the fiction behind tropical paradises. It is also a play on words: the idea of peace (pacific) is a mere fiction. Serra’s film is a film of contrasts: it is a masterfully cinematographed film featuring the beauty of Tahiti, and yet below all that beauty is emptiness and paralysis. \n\nIt is also a salient commentary on the persistence of both denialism and colonialism, despite the technological strides that have allowed the world to significantly progress over the past century. In this regard, Tahiti is the perfect setting, and de Roller, the High Commissioner of Tahiti, is the perfect focus. \nDe Roller is just like the myriad of common politicians here in the Philippines: he functions as the godfather in a compadrazgo system, connecting people together and also deriving a few benefits for himself as the broker. This can be seen in his manner of making sure that a casino will be constructed in Tahiti, because the people want it. He drops his usually unctuous manner in confrontations with his opposition, be they the local minister or an indigenous leader, and then bares his fangs. \n\nThe film is already worth viewing as a character study: Benoit Magimel is perfect as the antiheroic de Roller, who understands that even his power is minimal in the grand scheme of things. After seeing Song Kang-ho’s performance in **Broker**, and his performance here, Magimel did a lot more of heavy lifting as he is practically in every scene of the film. Pacifiction is, more often than not, a one-man show, and Magimel shows de Roller’s complexity. \n\nAs the movie progresses, however, the overarching problem that bothers de Roller intrudes quietly and gradually: the French government is threatening nuclear tests on the uninhabited islands of French Polynesia, but Tahiti will, of course, be affected because it is close. The younger generation have heard of the stories that their grandparents suffered, which is also why they are rallying against the resumption of tests. Eventually, de Roller unearths more evidence pointing to the activity of a French nuclear submarine nearby, but realizes that he is unable to do anything.\n\nI watched Cassavetes’s **Killing of a Chinese Bookie** last year, and it was Cassavetes’s version of a noir thriller. Serra, who has been known for his peculiar period dramas, offers his attempt of a political thriller. However, like Cassavetes, he appropriates the thriller genre and removes the thrill, instead leaving behind a complex character trying to maneuver around forces that are much more powerful than him. \n\nI do think that this film could have been edited to become tighter, but also think that this is Serra’s directorial decision. As a reflection on the reality of tropical politics, such as Tahiti’s or the Philippines, also mentioned in the film, it is insightful as it is cynical. This film is not for those with low attention spans, because it is heady, philosophical, and slowly cadenced. As a character drama, however, it is excellent, and as a critique of the colonialism that many of us have already thought as outdated, because in many other ways, the colonizers then are still trying to insidiously colonize us today.\n\n8.5/10",

        "text": "The Best Picture nominee of 2003 boasts a stellar cast in Penn, Robbins, Bacon &amp; Fishburne. Sean Penn &amp; Tim Robbins deservedly won awards for acting as they both fully inhabited their characters, although I think (Depp as Jack Sparrow would have been a fine choice too for Best Actor). Marcia Harden's performance as Celeste is very impactful too in terms of how we view a certain character throughout the film.\n\nThe 138-minute long movie is set in a Boston neighborhood where the aftermath of the murder of a young woman serves the premise of the film. The murder is directly connected to a trio of once-upon-a-time friends &amp; a terrible incident that happened 25 years ago. The reason I say it is well constructed is how Eastwood sets up different events and unravels mysteries in the film, which are multiple. The film starts with a leisurely pace, allowing us to get familiar with the characters and then background information keeps on getting gradually revealed. Until 2 mysteries simultaneously climax in a wonderfully done intercut sequence by the end.\n\nThe ending is powerful and truly makes the film memorable. The parade in the city brings all our main characters out on the street, together with their families except for Dave Boyle. Dave Boyle is the tragic figure of the story who leaves a cloud of sadness over the movie. He left his name incomplete on the cement slab just like his life was incomplete, literally &amp; figuratively. Does Dave Boyle serve as a reminder how little we do for victims in our world? That they are just expect them to move on? As Sean Penn's character says to Robbins' Dave in the end that \"you got in the car , not me\" it's truly hurtful. Putting ourselves in the victim's shoes remains an alien concept (though attitudes have changed a bit since 03). Even Dave Boyle's wife, Celeste isn't able to come close to Dave after he reveals his story to her. In fact it confirms her suspicions and sets her out on a path which ultimately leads to tragedy. \n\nMy take on the main theme of the film is the interplay between family &amp; personality. If we look at Kevin Bacon's Sean, who has a broken family, we can see it in his personality that he isn't too confident or assured. He does have a habit of drinking and remains slightly troubled in his free time. On the contrary we see Sean Penn's Jimmy, who married twice and has a strong bond with his wife and kids. He is very confident, strong &amp; bold. The interesting thing here is that in the end he is feeling guilty for his action. Yet when his wife comes in and justifies him and makes him feel like a \"king\" we see him move on from his actions. The family support system he has is all that matters and gives him an 'alpha' personality in the locality. \n\nFinally, you have the poor Dave Boyle whose relationship with his wife is weaker. There isn't a strong support system and no trust at all when it mattered. Which is why Dave appears as a weak, lost man who has not moved past his childhood trauma. The little bit of comfort he finds is when he spends time with his kid and that is it. \n\nOne thing I noted was the use of music. I was a bit surprised to learn going in that Eastwood had done the music for the film. So I was alert for the music and interestingly music was very sparsely used throughout the film. Yet the drama &amp; tension never felt lacking due to absence of music. The film serves as an example that over-reliance on music isn't necessary and filmmakers should strive to allow the audience to feel the music through the film itself rather than depend on music as a shortcut.\n\nThe final shot where Bacon &amp; Penn stare into each other and Bacon points a finger gun and shoots toward Penn was chilling. Adds a certain coolness to the proceedings and leaves you wondering what happens to the dynamic between the two.\n\nHow do you read this very final scene? Thoughts on the movie as a whole?",

        "text": "To accept hyper cynicism as being a person’s default state instead of a defence mechanism akin to a band aid applied over a severe wound, is to invalidate the inherent virtue of the individual and the experiences that led up to the application of said band aid. In Casablanca, Bogart’s Rick Blaine is not a cynic who has a change of heart mid way through. He is a principled individual who temporarily adopts cynicism as a response to past events and current surroundings. \n\nCasablanca might not be my favourite “Bogart plays a detached and bitter man who eventually finds goodness in his heart and does the right thing” (yes there is an entire list of incredible films you could categorize under that title), but it conveys these shifts better than any other. Unlike some of these other films, Casablanca uses flashbacks to convey exactly what caused this transformation within Rick Blaine. Through these flashbacks, this idea that cynicism is simply an adopted state is fortified. \n\nThe physical and the emotional are inextricably linked here as the protagonist adopts the facade to not only protect himself from the tumultuous environment around him, but also his inner self and heart which has been damaged by previous experiences. This linking is perhaps Casablanca’s greatest achievement as the eventual opening up of the heart is what drives Blaine to participate in the war effort. It is the internal decision to come out of the selfish pessimistic shell and recognize his own agency as an individual as well as the righteousness of others, which finally allows him to make a tangible difference in the world. As Kendrick Lamar recently rapped on The Heart Part 5: “You can’t help the world until you help yourself”. It is the bravery to shed the veil of bitterness that ultimately decides the nobility of the individual. Bringing all of this together so succinctly yet movingly through one of the greatest Hollywood protagonists of all time is what makes Casablanca a timeless masterpiece.\n\nCheck out my Letterboxd if you’d like to keep up with what I watch and write.

It was an already an iconic role, but I think Christopher McDonald should have been nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar for his role as Shooter McGavin, he would have been a great addition alongside William H Macy In fargo, Edward Norton in Primal Fear, and Steve Buscemi who I also think should have been nominated, but that's a more widely accepted snub. \n\nI'm gonna double up and make this a Christopher McDonald circle jerk, he was also really good as the gameshow host Tappy Tibbons, ridiculous on screen presence right from the very beginning of the movie, Marlon Wayans is probably the obvious snub choice in that film, but McDonald was also extremely good. Juice by Tappy! \n\nObviously these awards don't paint the full picture, and we are often left frustrated, however I do look at some nominations like Mickey Rourke in the wrestler, or Richard Farnsworth in the straight story and think it's pretty cool that they were acknowledged for their performances.",

I watched mostly 1970s+ movies from it, but now switched to watching it chronologically. I'm in late 1930s- early 40s now. As you now, there was a lot of musicals and slapstick romantic comedies in that era. I'm not a big fan and usually can't keep my hands from the phone while watching those. I don't even like modern musicals, but the ones from 30s seem very much seem like a time capsule, so very outdated.\n\nBut today I watched a movie named Hellzapoppin' from 1941 and it actually shocked me. This is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. Not necessary because it's super good and super funny (it is, but it's not the most important thing), but because of how much ahead of its time it is. And I'm not talking just cinema, I'm talking art in general. It is a pureblood postmodernist work of art. In 1941. Like 15 years before postmodernism was a thing. The movie blurs the line between reality and fiction, it routinly breaks the fourth wall, it is about the process of making a work of art, it's conscious about it being a work art, it's influenced by the Marx brothers and it even references Citizen Kane that came out earlier that year. It checks literally all the boxes for 'Postmodernist work'. It's like a Charlie Kaufman movie + Tristram Shandy, it does for 'classic slapstick musical' genre what 'Scream' did for horror, but is even more radical. AND THEY DID IT IN 1941. \n\nSo, thanks for coming to my TED Talk. I had to share it with someone. This is a seminal piece of art, I'm absolutely shocked that it's barely known, it should be studied in universities and I'm not even joking.",

        "text": "In slow cinema, the key technique is the long shot. This forces the viewer to meditate on the image itself, by creating a manipulation in time without actually contributing to the narrative. \n\nPaul Schrader talk about this extensively in his book 'Transcendental style in film'. When the viewers eye wanders it creates a parallel narrative to the films itself; the narrative of the eye. All of this I understand, and speaks for the beautiful nature of the slow cinema, as a way of viewer manipulation in the same way as narrative film would. \n\nWhere my question lies in this is why this contemplation that the viewer experiences during the slow cinema, should suggest anything of a elevated state rather than just appreciation of image and the connection between them? I don't get where the transcendental element comes in? Or the spiritual you may say? My guess would be that it comes in correlation with the narrative of the film? Can someone explain the ideas?",

        "text": "No, nothing supernatural happened (near as I can tell) but instead something psychological. Hear me out.\n\nI went to see that movie at the only screening available to me, at 10:50 at night, and I went alone because this was on a Wednesday, and thought that all my friends needed to sleep. I'm not a huge horror movie fan, in fact, I'm one of the biggest chickens out there. But, because everyone was talking about this, and because it was so unique, AND because I didn't know how long it'd be in theaters, I felt it prudent to see it as soon as possible.\n\nThere's a whole conversation to be had about whether this is scary or not, and a quick peek online shows just how divided the internet is, but for our purposes, all you need to know is that I was extremely terrified. Like all admirers of this movie say, it brings you back to the primal childhood fear of being alone in the dark, and because I had a phobia of the dark as a kid (I even slept with a night light until I was 5 or 6), this movie became nigh unbearable by the end of it. \n\nThis is where the weird thing happens.\n\nAs I drive and arrive at my home I try to comfort and distract myself by watching a bunch of simple and funny YouTube videos, many of which I'd already seen. While they sometimes made me happy, I was still unable to forget about the fear that Skinamarink imparted on me. I was scared to fall asleep, a feeling I hadn't felt since I was a kid, and was afraid that the film would seep into my nightmares. That was when I thought back to the kids and their tv.\n\nWhen they first realize something is wrong, after trying to find their father and calling the police, they decide to distract themselves from their predicament with the most classic of childhood pastimes: old cartoons and Lego toys. I then realized that I was doing the exact same thing those kids had done: try to ease my anxiety by indulging in something nostalgic and familiar, but ultimately failing to bring lasting comfort. The film truly and fully brought me back to my childhood, not just in the fear I felt, but in the coping mechanism I used.\n\nI know this is the case because another weird thing happened later. After the usual YouTube videos, I eventually started watching sports highlights, specifically soccer/football. I was NOT a sports fan growing up, in fact, I only recently got into soccer/football after watching the 2022 world cup. And this time, I truly did manage to forget about not just Skinamarink, but the anxiety I felt. It came back once it was time to sleep (I slept at 5am and with a light), but it made me realize that the reason I was able to be alleviated from my fear is because this is not a familiar childhood comfort, but a pastime I only recently acquired. \n\nMuch has been said about Skinamarink relying about the seemingly primordial childhood fear of being alone in the dark, but it should also be noted just how much this movie touches on many other aspects of being a kid, with many theorizing this to be some sort of nightmarish metaphor for child abuse/neglect. But it doesn't just explore childhood fear, but turns it's viewers into children as well, dredging up the things we'd rather forget and smother with entertainment. It's an a experience I hadn't had with a film before, and because of that, it's worthy of further examination.\n\nWell, it's something to think about tonight.",

Not to say I thought it was bad, I found it endlessly creative, but also endlessly annoying. It's like Scott Pilgrim meets A24 Mumblecore. I don’t think I can find many major faults within the film that don’t boil down to a difference in sense of humor or visual taste. I found that it ran long at times, but that’s a minor complaint. The overall theme of “We are all alone in a meaningless existence but we have each other and that’s enough” isn’t novel, but at least it is encased in fairly imaginative package. Thematically it ends how you think it would, but at least it arrived there in a way that for a moment really made me think it wouldn’t.\n\nI don’t think I liked it overall but it had a pretty well written script that seems to have achieved the vision of its creators. It’s hard to look at this and imagine the Daniels thinking “This is all wrong.”\n\nIt’s a well imagined world(s), and it’s competently rendered out. The two leads were also pretty good, I feel like I've seen the husband somewhere but I'm not sure where.\n\nAt times it looks cheap but I think that’s just the Daniels aesthetic, which again just comes down to a difference of aesthetic sensibility and humor.\n\nIn terms of the world Im not sure what the rules of jumping were, they seemed a\nlittle inconsistent but maybe I missed a detail or two. I just wish the filmmakers sense of humor was a little more mature because when I should have been laughing I was just annoyed and taken out of the experience.\n\nNot all good films coincide with your own taste, and this is an example of that. I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone, but I would recommend it to some. If you really liked it, I can see why, and if you disliked it I can see why too.",

They have never been republished before, to the best of my knowledge. Ever since someone dumped these old newspaper issues in the Internet Archive in October 2021, I have been slowly translating and posting select articles at various subreddits to share my findings with the wider community. \n\nIn January 1943, exactly eighty years ago, Imperial Japan was at war, but some Seoul residents still had time to enjoy some of the simple things in life, like going to the movies. To explore what kinds of foreign movies Seoul residents might have watched during this time, I browsed through the January 1943 Keijo Nippo newspapers for any movie ads for foreign films that were showing at movie theaters in Seoul. I identified the movies based on clues left in the ads, like the plot lines and the names of the directors and actors. Unsurprisingly, there were no American or British films, but I did find an eclectic selection of two French movies and six German movies:\n\nFrench movies:\n\n* [L'homme à l'Hispano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_with_the_Hispano_(1933_film)) (1933)\n* [Ma soeur de lait](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143533/) (1938)\n\nGerman movies:  \n\n* [Ein Lied geht um die Welt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_Goes_Round_the_World_(1933_film)) (1933)\n* [Rakoczy-Marsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rakoczi_March) (1933)\n* [Ihr größter Erfolg](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025298/) (1934)\n* [Königswalzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Waltz_(1935_film)) (1935)\n* [Kora Terry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032677/) (1940)\n* [Wunschkonzert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunschkonzert) (1940)\n\nSome of these movies are available to watch online in clips or, in some cases, in their entirety on Youtube or Internet Archive, so I will share links below along with the movie ads. I linked to resources on Wikipedia and the Internet Movie Database wherever I could.\n\n[L'homme à l'Hispano](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199604/) (1933) was a French comedy starring [Marie Bell](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068372/?ref_=tt_ov_st) (pictured in the ad) and [Jean Murat](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0613576/?ref_=tt_ov_st), whose names are printed on the ad. This film was made into a double feature, where you had to sit in for the domestic Imperial Japanese film ([闘ふ男](https://www.japanese-cinema-db.jp/Details?id=21638)) if you wanted to watch the foreign film. The film only showed from January 11th to the 13th. The full movie is available on the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/lhomme-a-lhispano-epstein).\n\n[Ma soeur de lait](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143533/) (1938) was a French comedy starring [Meg Lemonnier](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0501532/?ref_=tt_ov_st) (pictured in this ad) and [Henri Garat](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0304848/?ref_=tt_ov_st), and directed by [Jean Boyer](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004454/?ref_=tt_ov_wr), whose names are printed on the ad. This was also shown as a double feature with a domestic Imperial Japanese film ([心は偽らず](https://www.shochiku.co.jp/cinema/database/02307/)), and for only three days: January 11th, 12th, and 13th.\n\n[Ein Lied geht um die Welt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_Goes_Round_the_World_(1933_film)) (1933) was a German musical starring [Charlotte Ander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Ander) (pictured in the ad) and [Joseph Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schmidt), whose names are printed on this ad. Interestingly, although this film premiered during the Third Reich, it was subsequently banned in Nazi Germany in 1937. But apparently, it was still allowed to be shown in Imperial Japan. This was also shown as a double feature with a domestic Imperial Japanese film ([海の見える家](https://www.nikkatsu.com/movie/13876.html)), and for only three days: January 22th, 23th, and 24th.\n\n[Rakoczy-Marsch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486149/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) (1933) starred [Gustav Fröhlich](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0297054/?ref_=tt_ov_dr), [Leopold Kramer](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0469597/?ref_=tt_ov_st), [Camilla Horn](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0394806/?ref_=tt_ov_st), and [Paul Wagner](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906040/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t4) whose names are all printed on this ad. This was also shown as a double feature with a domestic Imperial Japanese film ([愛国の花](https://www.shochiku.co.jp/cinema/database/02346/)), and for only five days from January 27th.\n\n[Ihr größter Erfolg](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025298/) (1934) was a film starring [Marta Eggerth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Eggerth), pictured and named in this ad. This was also shown as a double feature with a domestic Imperial Japanese film ([愛国の花](https://www.shochiku.co.jp/cinema/database/02346/)), and only on January 27th. A clip is available on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/xOT-X5k-0b8). \n\n[Königswalzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Waltz_(1935_film)) (1935) was a German musical starring [Carola Höhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carola_H%C3%B6hn), who is pictured and named in this ad. Although the original 1935 film cannot be found online, clips of the 1955 remake can be found on YouTube. This was also shown as a double feature with a domestic Imperial Japanese film ([君を呼ぶ歌](https://movies.yahoo.co.jp/movie/133845/)), and only on January 24th, 25th, and the 26th. \n\n[Kora Terry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032677/) (1940) was a spy thriller starring [Marika Rökk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marika_R%C3%B6kk) (pictured in these ads) and directed by [Georg Jacoby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Jacoby), whose names are printed on this ad. This movie required a special invitation to watch, with movie seats preferentially going to \"industrial warriors\". There was a preview screening of the movie at 9 pm January 30th, and then the movie premiered in Seoul on February 1st. Unlike the other foreign films, this one was not paired with a domestic Imperial Japanese film. Two German brochures for this movie are available on the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/koraterry0000dasp) and [here](https://archive.org/details/koraterry0000illu).\n\n[Wunschkonzert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunschkonzert) (1940) was a German drama propaganda film starring [Ilse Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilse_Werner), who is prominently featured on the ads. This movie was apparently heavily promoted in Keijo Nippo, since its ads come up the most frequently among the foreign films advertised on Keijo Nippo. This movie required a special invitation to watch, with movie seats preferentially going to \"working women\" with \"no men allowed\". There was a preview screening of the movie at 9:10 pm January 15th, and then the movie premiered in Seoul on January 18th, playing until January 24th. Unlike the other foreign films, this one was not paired with a domestic Imperial Japanese film. The German brochure for this movie is available on the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/wunschkonzert0000illu). The full movie (no subtitles) is available on the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/wunschkonzert-d-1940-spielfilm-you-tube).

He even would consider an English remake so that the intention of those scenes hit their mark for Non-Korean audiences.\n\nPersonally, those scenes weren't that less impactful for me as he seems to suggest. I really loved his style with his framing and cool editing tricks for shot transitions, am glad he's still trying them in fresh ways. I had been hesitant for years to watch JSA but after watching it a few months ago it was a delightful surprise he had honed his style that early.\n\nI've always found his final sequences very impactful especially in Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr Vengeance. But in this one it just wasn't that strong for me. I was expecting it to be very powerful after the body in the pool scene. Maybe their romance needed more screentime or more sexier scenes to make the end more powerful.  I was also hoping he wouldn't resort to another suicide scene as he loves.\n\nThe silent visual storytelling is hypnotic in those earlier films compared to this one in my opinion but all in all I expect to love it even more on rewatching just like I did with some of his films.",

        "text": "There is a sort of quiet beauty to McCabe and Mrs. Miller, mingled inbetween its tragedy. McCabe riding into town, a stranger come to leave his mark. A crowded saloon come gloaming dark, filled with lively chatter and godless faces, drenched in dreary shadow but for an old, greasy lantern's flame, anemic above a poker table. A church being constructed against the sun, its cross a black shadow being erected, while its insides a forgotten hollow. Scenes of simple beauty: the townsfolk dancing at the whorehouse near Christmas-time. Mrs. Miller giggling in bed with McCabe, framed in that soft fabric red of her bed. And scenes of melancholy: McCabe opening up to Mrs. Miller, knowing his fate is sealed, crying honest in her arms. Then her walking out at night in the snow, slivers of yellow light haloing her like some Japanese woodblock painting. Beauty mingled with tragedy, inextricable like two interwoven fates.\n\n\nThis is a film about overreach and brief fulfillment. John McCabe comes to a fledgling town and makes himself out to be some infamous outlaw and shrewd businessman. In reality, he is a near illiterate fraud. Constance Miller, hearing of McCabe's modest success running a brothel at the town, rides in as a woman of ambition with dreams of the future. She is the shrewd businesswoman McCabe wishes he could be, but also an opium addict. The two partner up and find success at the town, but it does not last. Bigger game comes to muscle their way in, the Harrison Shaughnessy Mining Company. After McCabe turns down an offer from them to buy his holdings, they send killers after him. \n\n\nThere is nothing very loud about the film. Even when McCabe is being hunted, Altman focuses on the small, human qualities of McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller. This is not a film of action but people. Much of it focuses on the everyday routines of the townsfolk, and the struggles between McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Their relationship makes for the strongest scenes of the film, though these scenes are few and far between. Altman's naturalist style places emphasis on the things unsaid, on the insinuations and negative space. We know McCabe falls in love with Constance Miller, though he never admits it til near the end. We know she has feelings for him but struggles with her ambition and addiction. He hates that she is also a whore in her bordello, and that she makes him pay every time; a way for her to keep her boundaries perhaps, or maybe fund her addiction, and something that reminds him that he isn't the man he pretends to be.\n\n\nI would have liked for a greater focus on Constance Miller, but I cannot deny that there is a power to the sparseness afforded her character. Julie Christie's eyes and smile convey more in brief moments than any dialogue could muster. Flashes of happiness and concern, dominance and vulnerability, speak greater volumes than her time onscreen. So much so, that her downfall, shadowed behind McCabe's, hits harder, for me, than his. \n\n\nFor at the end, McCabe comes into the fantasy he projected. In desperation, he becomes that infamous outlaw and manages to kill the men sent after him, but not without being mortally wounded. Mrs. Miller, having her dreams nearly realised, understands that they are all but shattered after McCabe's being marked for death. She ends the film in an opium den, smoking dejectedly. As the film cuts between McCabe being buried beneath the snow and a closeup of her dead, spaced out, eyes, her fate seems the more tragic of the two, as she remains alive to suffer.\n\n\nIt is a heartbreaking film that eschews sentimentality. Set in a town full of empty camaraderie, teetering on the edge of civilisation, a place where women are naught but chattel and lives akin to fragile porcelain, two persons come to leave their mark, and mark each other instead. We see their flawed, honest humanity amidst the empty living of that fledgling town. When McCabe and Mrs. Miller are both dying and far gone, we see the townsfolk celebrating, having put out a fire from the church they had neglected to finish building in the first place; they had decided to focus on building McCabe's whorehouse instead.\n\n\nThere are times I think the film's pacing loses too much of its focus, mostly during its climax, which I think could have been edited down slightly. Altman's style leads to an empty feeling at times, a feeling of not having enough and only giving what is necessary and nothing more. It makes the film feel almost terse and gives it a yearning quality that fits with its titular namesakes. Yet McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller is a film that also elicited wonder from me for its sheer compositional beauty and small, potent emotions; and tragedy amidst its slow, almost pre-ordained march towards its characters' dead-endedness.",

Finnegan is a interesting director with enough to hop on using his filming aesthetic, made me curious about a laundry list of questions, but I think there's no wrong interpretation of the film. And I'm really interested in other people's interpretation, so foxes main character is about a woman who works home and has to clean up her trash from foxes,\n\nit made me wonder, whats it like to live in a world where your unhappy being married and work day in and day out, similar to vivarium with Jesse eisenburg's character who lives with his gf and they are stuck in a creepy neighborhood with a baby who torments them. its a interesting idea to be in a life where your unhappy wanting to change the world and live your dreams only to have life take a toll on you. so I wondered could the foxes be living in this creepy neighborhood with an enclosure, container, or structure adapted or prepared for keeping animals under semi-natural conditions for observation or study or as pets; an aquarium or terrarium.....its creepy to think both characters live in same black roofed houses that continue on forever to be stuck in...? are the foxes a metaphor for being alone with your thoughts? both films show you how being stuck with a significant other and stuck in a residential neighborhood is essentially a melting pot or alloy versus the salad, quilt, choir, family, or sedimentary rock. The latter seem better figures for community because they preserve a sense of the individuals who comprise the whole a spooky lifestyle..🤔",

Same for *Omer*; there’s almost a sense of being in that courtroom and there is nothing extraneous to distract from the actors’ performances.\n\nI read a review that said this was likely influenced by Jeanne Dielmann. Would Chantal Akerman be a good place to start if I want to explore more films in this style? What other directors make films like this? Is there a name for it? Since the Sight &amp; Sound poll dropped I’ve seen various people refer to that as maybe the most influential film of all time so I have to imagine that there are many others out there.",

To that end, I was also surprised at the level of artistry that went into making the film . When I first heard about the film, I thought it simply going to be shocking and violent. I did not expect so many surrealist aspects to the film, and that final montage was one of the most poignant and thoughtful sequences I've ever seen.   \n\n\nI get that what I am saying isn't new to this internet or the sub - the film's genius has been highly documented. I will say that those that are worried about the film being shocking for the sake of shock, know that the film is very intentionally crafted with an astounding level of artistry, and if you have any love of film I would recommend watching despite its incredibly grim subject matter.",

I’m left wondering if I would have enjoyed the film more if it was exactly the same, but PTA was credited as the director. This seems kind of moronic to me, given that the quality of the film would be exactly the same.\n\nOf course, there are many times when I come to appreciate a film more through knowledge of a director’s other works. However sometimes I wonder if I am biased towards films that are made by directors who I already like. Would I have such a high opinion of these movies if they were exactly the same film, but the name on the box was someone else?

        "text": "Anyone else think Kubrick's \"Spartacus\" has aged better than Scott's \"Gladiator\"?\n\nRewtched both these films recently. Scott's film is of course better than all the other early 2000s epics - \"King Arthur\", \"Troy\" etc - and delivers better spectacle than everything from this period other than\"The Lord of the Rings\" movies. But it IMO still feels like a conventional early-2000s epic.\n\nKubrick's film, meanwhile, offers things both modern and old swords-and-sandals flicks lacked. There's a rich, novelistic quality to the screenplay. There's a vein of intellectualism to the writing. Both the script and the visuals slowly \"expand\" to encompass more of the world as the film goes along. There's a vein of black humor. And there are heavy themes consistently reinforced (sexism, dehumanization, exploitation, critiques of power and heriarchies).\n\nKubrick basically disowned \"Spartacus\" because he didn't have full control, and this does lead to some hokey aspects (some iffy acting, costumes, music etc). And you can tell there are one or two scenes which he probably didn't direct himself.\n\nBut he also adds little stylistic touches which elevate the film. For example he constantly slows down and stretches the moments of anticipation prior to the film's action sequences, which has the effect of heightening the drama and our investment. Watch, for example, how he dwells on preparations for battles, the arrangement of troops, and in the lead up to the film's first gladiator battle, hides the camera in a wooden cage and films the drama through little slats in the window, the violence barely visible and hinted at through sounds and fleeting glances.\n\nThe film's romance is also slowed right down. \"Barry Lyndon\" is rightly hailed for one sequence in which lovers wordlessly trade glances for six or so minutes, but a precursor to that scene is here in \"Spartacus\", when Kirk Douglas waits in line for the woman he loves to pour him a drink. The whole thing is done entirely with visuals and music - no talking - and Kubrick simply focuses on glances eyeballs, and fingers touching.\n\nSo there's a visual intelligence to the film that you rarely see in a 1950s/60s epic. Shots are well framed, sequences are a little bit idiosyncratic, a little bit smarter and highbrow that typical, and at every opportunity (difficult, as this was a very wordy script which he little input on) he strives to eschew dialogue and be as visual and cinematic as possible. I can't think of anyone other than David Lean who was doing arty mainstream epics during this period. And this is Kubrick as a gun-for-hire.",

After watching that extraordinary film I went on Letterbox to see if there were any good discussions and the biggest complaint was the pacing. Which really struck me.\n\nFrom my meagre perspective the pacing of the film mirrors Nicholson's alienation. It was absorbing. He's such a piece of shit. He doesn't fit in anywhere and constantly punishes everyone around him for it. And I truly believe the pacing of the film not only reveals that but provides you with the space and opportunity to reflect on the character and the dynamics of his relationships with the people around him.\n\nI know since the 90s films have had an increasingly energetic pacing but I'm not sure that's always for the best. Instead of being rushed along from plot point to plot point maybe it's ok to languor in the performances.",

More than that though, it’s left me a little speechless at just how much cinema there is to learn and enjoy.\n\nI’m in my mid-30s and I’ve always been in love with with cinema, it’s how I spent countless childhood hours and it’s how I make my living today. I’ve always considered myself well educated in cinema both Hollywood and worldwide, amongst my friends and colleagues there are few people I meet who enjoy the totality of cinema in the same way, from silent Buster Keaton films to 70s blaxploitation, Hong Kong king-fu or European slow-burners. \n\nThat said, Tarantino in this book shows such a deep understanding and knowledge of cinema that it leaves me in awe. This isn’t about him just name dropping films, it’s about his understanding of their time and place in Hollywood history, his analysis of their impact at the time of their release and a reflection of their power now. He writes in such a passionate way that you can’t but be inspired by how clearly cinema runs through his blood.\n\nI’ve always been aware of some of the greats and how encyclopaedic their cinema knowledge is; Scorcese, Bogdanovich and Edgar Wright come to mind. But often the insight I get from them is their lists of films that have inspired them which are stuffed full of little-known films that only true film fans would know - people that appreciate the art and craft wherever they discover it. This though is the first book where I’ve felt how personal cinema is to a filmmaker, how deeply their experiences in front of the silver screen impacted them and made them who they are. Its also written in such a accessible way, just like his scripts there is nothing academic about his re-counting of 70s Hollywood - it is all anecdotes and first hand experience which adds to the uniqueness of it. It’s an intoxicating read and one that has inspired me to seek out and watch an abundance of new films.  \n\nI wholly recommend the book to anyone on this sub and welcome any recommendations for similar books to enjoy.",

        "text": "I know that's a loaded subject header, but to start with an example, Richard Kelly's *Southland Tales* is a movie that I generally find to be a clustered, overwrought mess with some laughably bad dialogue at times. I'm sure it can still be made sense of, yet despite it being so problematic in most areas, I'm still intrigued to revisit it because of its unquestionable originality within its scope, and its narrative and stylistic novelty. Again, it still amounts to a bad movie in my eyes, but its ambition (and the distinctiveness of Kelly's singular vision) can't be understated, so it's worth praising on those terms. As a result, I can't help but anticipate in the slightest what he has in mind for his next film (if ever makes one to follow up with after *The Box*).\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience with a film like this? One that clearly has a lot of ambition and originality to admire, despite it being rough-around-the-edges or just plain bad? One other quick example I'll give is John Cassavetes' *Shadows*. I know some people here might absolutely love it, and some point I kind of did as well, but upon re-watching it I felt like there was nothing enticing enough to hook me through all of its improvised vignettes that didn't seem to amount to anything meaningful or consequential. I know that may have been the point, but at least the acting and jazzy atmosphere were certainly worth appreciating, as the gritty, rough-around-the-edge technical qualities didn't detract for me too much (sometimes it helped the mood) because in general, I was able to look past that and see it for its ingenuity and boldness in an era when Hollywood was in need of fresh voices. It still isn't that good to me overall, but I'm glad I still saw potential in Cassavetes since it encouraged me to discover so many of his better films.\n\nSuffice to say, I'd rather watch something that swings for the fences and fails when doing so than something that doesn't make any bold moves, yet is still more accessible, passable, or even crowd-pleasing.",

Its a free, pub style trivia hosted by myself and Mike Vanderbilt (co-programmer of the Music Box of Horrors). It’s the LAST THURSDAY of every month. It starts at 7pm, and is followed by a screening at 9:00.\n\nThis month (1/26) we’re showing Jack Hills classic(?) 1975 teen girl gang exploitation movie THE SWITCHBLADE SISTERS. Its a great “could this even be made today??” flick that was somehow inspired by both Shakespeare and Ayn Rand?? You need to see it to believe it.\n\nThis is 2023’s first trivia event monthly series, and we hope to keep it a cool, fun time for people to meet up and talk about film! There are tons of prizes for the top 3 teams (of up to 4 players each), including rare vintage film posters, rare boutique DVDs &amp; VHS, &amp; promo swag from film distributors. We’ve got a giant 40”x60” vintage poster of Bergman’s HOUR OF THE WOLF to hand out this time around. Plus we give out free movie passes for the winners of each round. Free shit at free trivia!\n\nIt’s for people of all levels of film knowledge and enjoyment. In the past we’ve had categories such “Written For the Screen” where we played cheesy songs written specifically for a movie and you had to tell us what film it was for, “Take the Money and Run” where we ask you about actors who took a giant paycheck from a huge blockbuster series and then used their clout and money to make the weirdest personal projects. We also have a monthly “Loser’s Luck” category where the team that scores the lowest gets to pick a category for the following month – so even if you lose, you get the advantage the next time around. This month it’s Nancy Meyers movies!\n\nThe concession stand is open all night for your popcorn/candy/beer/soda needs. So feel free to come by and check it out! Sign up is at 6:30-6:45pm.",

        "text": "It's a difficult thing to answer and the question may seem vague to some. But over the years, watching TV and watching movies, you were easily able to differentiate between the two. They were different experiences. TV simply could never reach the heights of some movies. Just from the look/visuals alone you could tell whether it was a movie or a show.\n\nTV just never had enough resources to match the spectacle a movie could provide. The best writers, directors &amp; actors would prefer movies over TV anyday. A TV actor would seem a lower category actor than a movie actor, no matter how good.\n\nBut in late 00s and throughout 2010s, the lines between them blurred. TV stars started headlining major movies and movie stars would be often seen doing prestige TV. Similarly, other talent has been easily switching between the two mediums. \n\nThis has resulted in a big jump in quality of TV overall. Now so many shows have a 'cinematic' touch. They are stylized and presented in such a way, plus with greater resources backing the productions, you get a much superior product on the whole as compared to 10-15 years ago.\n\nSome gamechangers have been prestige TV like Sopranos, Mad Men &amp; Breaking Bad which showed the grade A quality of writing &amp; acting that can be seen on the small screen. Then Game of Thrones was highly influential and impactful whereby the scale and spectacle of larger-than-life storytelling only seen in movies was now being done on TV. Finally streaming changed the game in major ways too. Worldwide access to the longform medium has drove interest in TV among a much larger crowd. Netflix hits like Queens Gambit, Squid Game or Wednesday make much more noise than any movie released on streaming.\n\nGiven this background, do you feel TV is coming close to being 'cinematic'? Of course the runtime difference will always be a colossal difference between the two. But the techniques employed, quality of talent hired, scale of productions setup all have helped elevate TV over the years big time and TV has become a serious rival to cinema. This can be seen in discussions where some people much prefer their favorite stories from books/games to be adapted for TV rather than Cinema. Because people now believe they will get the same experience as that of a movie (minus the theatrical part ofc), but just a longer, more detailed version of it.\n\nSome examples of shows that really remind me of movies are Game of Thrones, Fargo Season 2, The Crown &amp; Queen's Gambit.",

I live in the desert Southwest, I love the West, I love the setting, look, and the feel of the West, but I’m actually not a *huge* fan of Westerns on the whole (with some major exceptions), as I feel that they often resort to cliché narrative conventions and hackneyed tropes and I end up feeling like I'm just watching the same movie over and over. \n\nNoir, on the other hand, I generally love. Of course, Film Noir is not itself immune to repetitiveness either, but overall I feel like there is a vast array of \"Noir\" films and so many of them manage to be executed with ingenuity, novelty, and style. \n\nBut Noir is very much an \"urban\" genre, which is great in it's own way. However, like I said, I really love the setting of Westerns. So I've started to take note of, and watch, more films that meet the \"Noir\" criteria, but which are set in the West. And I would love to see more. \n\nBelow is a small list of films I've compiled that I would place in this category...These are by no means definitive and are certainly up for debate, but I would love others' contributions and recommendations as well!\n\nNo Country For Old Men - Coen Brothers\n\nBlood Simple - Coen Brothers\n\nLone Star - John Sayles \n\nBadlands - Terrence Malick \n\nHell or High Water -  David Mackenzie\n\nWind River - Taylor Sheridan\n\nSicario - Denis Villeneuve\n\nDead Man - Jim Jarmusch\n\nAin't Them Bodies Saints - David Lowery",

I’ve been searching for more info on this but none of the articles I’ve found go into too much detail about it. I know Elaine May has an improv background and is a renowned actress in her own right, but is it really fair to say that “most of it” was improvised?

What was May’s directing style like for this particular work? Thanks!",

        "text": "Untangling the metaphysical rope that conceals the realities of this world can never be done through precision and rationality. For the rope is too long and the knots too tight. A young girl’s bedroom in Georgetown, Washington D.C. acts as a staging ground where attempts are made at untying one of these knots. For me, humility is not simply abstinence from individual pride or the acknowledgement of one’s own deficiencies. It is the recognition that despite outward progress, human beings as a collective have not, and will never (At least without divine help. But that’s another topic for another day) uncover the ultimate truths. \n\nThat is what makes The Exorcist so masterful in its examination of the world. Conventional wisdom would dictate that the horror would be more effective if the possessed girl were to be located in a remote area with only those closest to her knowing her condition. The hackneyed cherry on top would be Regan transforming back to her regular innocent self in the presence of strangers in order to keep up appearances. But the terror of The Exorcist is elevated precisely because it does the opposite. Professional experts in the western capital of the world apply their prowess to cure the innocent child of her terrible condition but they are left with more questions than answers. In doing so, the film makes it very clear that this is not demon vs a specific individual. It is demon vs all of mankind. And mankind with all of its advancements is still falling short. Now that is scary. \n\nBut is it also not relieving? Indeed The Exorcist despite its darkness is not a nihilistic film. It is the opposite. The examination of faith in art appeals to me more than any other subject and who knew that one of the greatest examples of this was right under my nose this whole time. A horror movie I loved as a child and whose greatness has been talked about by more people than any other film in the genre. But this time it wasn’t the twisting heads or the spider walks that garnered my admiration (Don’t get me wrong all of that is great and it adds to the experience). It was the clarity with which all the various parts come together to ask and even attempt to answer the difficult questions. It is Damien Karras’ regaining of faith and acceptance of duty through the loss and actions of his extremely faithful and senior counterpart priest Merrin. It is his realization that the answer to the age old question of “If God loves humans then why do bad things happen to good people?”, as a 12 year old girl gets ravaged by a demon in front of his very eyes, is perhaps contained in the question itself. It is the acceptance of faith by the previously faithless secular mother through both unimaginable suffering and witnessing the capacity of human beings to love amidst the horror. \n\nSo coming back to the original point. How is the rope untangled? I don’t know. Does it even matter? Perhaps we were never the ones meant to untangle it.\n\nCheck out my Letterboxd if you’d like to keep up with what I watch and write.

        "text": "Years ago I noticed the thematic similarity between a scene in There Will Be Blood and a scene in The Master, and now that I recollect similar scenes in Boogie Nights and Magnolia, I'm wondering if anyone agrees that these moments form a great motif in Anderson's filmography.\n\nThe moment when the \"skeptic\" challenges Phillip Seymour Hoffman (\"I've never been to the Pyramids, and yet we know they are there, for learned men have told us.\") is by far my favorite scene in The Master, and it reminds me of the funniest scene in There Will Be Blood: when Daniel refuses to get bought out by Big Oil. (\"One night I'm going to come to you inside of your house, wherever you're sleeping...\")\n\nBoth those scenes depict a bizarre character (Lancaster Dodd, Plainview) living in an insular world who is suddenly confronted by \"normal\" people who are able swat away their (Dodd's and Plainview's) grandiose ideas like fleas. I only watched Boogie Nights once a few years ago, but I recall a scene where a character is denied a job because his prospective employer somehow found out thay he'd worked in porn. Thus most of Anderson's movies focus on \"outsider\" protagonists who brush up against \"the real world\" only once in the whole film, but that disillusionment shatters them nonetheless.\n\nThe scenes near the first hour of Magnolia where an African American woman startles Frank T.J. Mackey with interview questions about his troubled family history (\"I'm quietly judging you\"--once again, by far my favorite scenes in the movie) serve a similar function. The interviewer punctures Mackey's delusional self-image of domination and virility, and her probing, professional demeanor gets under his skin.\n\nEach of the people \"confronting\" Anderson's protagonists are perfectly calm and reasonable, but their poise and politeness infuriates Plainview, Dodds, and Mackey all the more, because those men know that they will never behave normally, that they are forever trapped in the void of delusion and grandiosity that Anderson has created. \n\nI don't recall analogous moments in Punch Drunk Love, Phantom Thread, or Licorice Pizza, but I might have missed something, since those films certainly have \"outsider\" protagonists. (There Will Be Blood and The Master are the only ones I've seen more than once, so I'd appreciate any corrections about these films' content.)\n\nInherent Vice is the clear outlier, since most of Doc's interactions disillusion him throughout the film, and he's not as deluded/bizarre as Anderson's other protagonists. Pynchon's voice is stronger than Anderson's throughout IV (and the movie's all the better for it).",

        "text": "Patton is a 1970 film Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and Stars George C. Scott as General George S. Patton Jr. and chronicles his time in World War II.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this film, especially George C. Scott as Patton, who delivers a very complex performance as Patton, who while a great general, comes across as a pompous buffon. Also great is Karl Malden as Sgt. Omar Bradley who serves as a foil to Patton. One thing that surprise me is that the Script was written by Francis Ford Coppola and that Coppola's script was originally rejected by Studios, and was only saved because George C. Scott didn't like the current Script the Studio had and read Coppola's script earlier and stated that he would only accept the role if they used Coppola's Script. This resulted in Francis Ford Coppola in winning the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and that this resulted in Coppola not getting fired for The Godfather\n\nAlso, tidbit that Before George C. Scott, Leo Marvin, Burt Lancaster, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger, and John Wayne were either considered or turned down the role of Patton?\n\nI think what makes the film is the opening scene, In which Patton addresses the Audience or his Troops with the American Flag in the background, emphasizing   the importance of Americans as Star Role Models, and that his Men needs to defeat the enemy by working and fighting as a team. and then when you see the film, you see that Patton is doing the opposite.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Patton?\n\nDo you think the other actors above could of played Patton?",

        "text": "It's no secret that the Academy favors a specific kind of film and a specific kind of performance. As a small-budget, psychological horror film, Andrew Semans' Resurrection (2022) is more likely than not to be overlooked when Oscar noms are announced at the end of the month. Which is a shame, because it's one of the best films I saw last year with one of the best performances I saw last year.\n\nResurrection is one of those films that I can't share much about the plot without spoiling it for people, or accidentally revealing my theory about what's going on behind the scenes of the plot. But I'm going to try anyway, because you need some of the context to understand why the performance is so remarkable. \n\nIn short: A high-strung single mother (Rebecca Hall) with a job as a pharmaceutical executive has her world upended as she begins to encounter a familiar face (Tim Roth) lurking at the edges of her carefully curated life. \n\nAs the audience focuses in on the mystery of who this stranger is, what he wants, how he's connected to Hall's character, and why she's so upset about his presence, sideplots start taking on additional weight - the mother's relationship with her career, the mother's relationship with her daughter, the daughter's approaching departure for college, and more. Domestic abuse in its many forms is the current that runs through everything and ties the different plotlines together. If you've been paying attention, by the end you should be asking yourself exactly who is being gaslit by whom.\n\nThe entire cast is superb, the writing is tight and focused, and Hall in particular is exceptional. One way to read the film is a character study of how certain survivors of domestic abuse attempt to impose control on their surroundings to ensure the safety of themselves and their loved ones, because they know what can happen once they've lost control. Hall is so believable as the type-A corporate figurehead that her complete implosion in the film's second half is rendered all the more remarkable. She becomes an embodiment of the sort of \"hurt people hurt people\" message that seems to hover above the story, and as someone who is close with several survivors of abuse, it felt about as true-to-life as I can imagine.\n\nIn my fantasy world, a clip of a certain minutes-long, single shot monologue delivered by Hall during the movie would be shown right after her name is read out by whoever presents the award for best actress..... \n\n....and right before she inevitably loses to Cate Blanchett. \n\nAnyways, to those who haven't seen it, I apologize for the vagueness of my recap. But if you have, I'd love to hear your thoughts. This is a film that none of my friends had heard of, much less seen, so I'm a little starved for conversation on it.",

From marvel movies to dramatic award season blockbusters. \nThis is something I think about all the time but the reason I’m thinking about it right now is that I just watched captain Phillips last night. I had never seen it before. \nIt’s a well loved movie, it has a 3.7 in letterbox which is a high rating for that site. \nBut the film is very heavy handed in its American exceptionalism and military might pov. All the shots of navy seals and snipers and helicopters and navy boats really irked me, especially because of how popular the film was at the time and how it’s so highly rated online. \nDo people not see this kind of stuff when they are watching these movies. \nJingoism is extremely prevalent in most major Hollywood movies,  even ones that are claiming to be against in it in the ultimate message. Take avatar 2 for instance. It’s supposed to be about how the humans are bad etc. and he even came out saying he took out of the violence And guns in the movie. but that doesn’t stop Cameron from a quarter of the film shots of crazy military technologies and all the fancy gadgets and guns they have. \n\nNot sure what my ultimate point is, just wanna hear some other thoughts on this. \nSo I don’t feel like I’m alone here on this.",

I didn't realize until seeing this movie how rare it is to see a really healthy family on the silver screen in Hollywood. Most families are toxic and broken. This family was unbelievable. They had several kids, all unique. Jake became a very respectable, loving, and present father, who is so invested in his children and his family. Natiri is caring and compassionate and still the badass from the first movie. Jake and Natiri still love eachother, the kids love eachother, and the kids love the parents. The kids are all flawed and unique in the best possible way. This movie did such an unbelievable job with this family, and it's so nice to see this in Hollywood, and it makes me forgive the other flaws in the movie. What do you all think?",

Of course Michael Scott is another great character that Steve uses to challenge your empathy. Maybe it's also something he works hard at, but I think his face helps a lot.",
