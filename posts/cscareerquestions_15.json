Senior engineers know business logic and all that jazz but a lot aren't as capable of writing boilerplate code as efficiently as their subordinates because they have bigger responsibilities. Doesn't it seem likely that AI would replace a lot of juniors and mid-level engineers by writing code that can then just be tweaked by seniors as it needs to be?",

The applications were for a junior position or an internship.\n\nHowever, today I got an email to schedule a 30 minute interview for a Senior position in that company for the same domain. I DID NOT APPLY FOR THAT. I have no professional experience, not even an internship. I checked both my emails, and I have nowhere written that I would want a senior position. It's clear from my CV as well, I have only my projects listed and no professional experience. I am confident for a junior/internship position, but not senior.\n\nSo what do I do? I am afraid I would be humiliated in the interview and he would end it within a minute after knowing I am not eligible for a senior. Should I let him know through the email, telling him that there might have been a mistake? But I also don't wanna lose the chance of the interview as it's literally my dream company.\n\nSomeone please give me some advice.",

        "text": "I worked in some rather shady startup/small businesses. These places may not be big in scope in what they do, but several have been toxic/dysfunctional, and had to put up with it for much less pay than the big boys in tech. It might actually make me more prepared for the crap that Twitter, Uber, or Rainforest devs have to endure.\n\nOne of my first jobs I was the only dev, bus factor of one. I worked part-time and I was on-call- while I was still enrolled in college. I kid you not, one time I was working on a term paper when my boss called me up because a bug in their content system was messing with the writers' formatting, and I was expected to fix it or a writer might get fired. I kindly told them no, I need to finish homework, and didn't hear about the incident again.\n\nAnother place, the boss was more chill, but everyone's paycheck came in late for the first three months I worked there. Probably the least severe of offenses here, actually.\n\nIn one marketing agency I was misclassified as a contractor. I was 1099 but they expected me to show up 9-5 like full-time. As is with every other individual contributor at the company. The co-founder of the company made multiple excuses to workers as to why it was so hard to do the paperwork for hiring full-time people, but I just think it's about tax evasion. Management is all over the place and the company in general was a revolving door with high turnover. After quitting, in later company reviews I've read, the current CEO has made people cry by tearing them down.\n\nHaving made anywhere $12 to $20 an hour at these places, the thought of making upwards of $120k where they are happy giving out PIPs to fire people, or where a sudden takeover lead to massive resignations, that's still an upgrade to me. I had seen people resign the day I took their job for a quarter of what Twitter employees are making.\n\nAll these jobs had one thing in common too: They don't understand good workflows or development methodologies. Sometimes, there are interns solely responsible for a lot of $ on client accounts, and because they're interns they naturally make mistakes and a lot of client money is wasted. I'm not going to pretend everywhere in big tech is also squeaky clean when it comes to their own practices, either.\n\nBut even with being in the trenches of companies doing questionable things, is it too foolhardy of an assessment to just go for the dregs of big tech if their salaries are still a lot higher than any place I've worked for? I know I'm not qualified to go for the best of big tech, might as well try out the less desirable tech companies while taking advantage of the higher (for me) salaries.\n\nBeen recently asked by a recruiter at Rainforest for a screening and resume, and I think I'll give it a go.",

I’d love to work with all these tools with a bigger team with more infrastructure, but I’m not entirely certain what’s expected of me to know as a .NET developer at a bigger company.

        "text": "For context, I worked at FAANG-1 (2.25 years), non-FAANG (4.25 years), and now FAANG-2 (1 year). I had an okay start of my career at FAANG-1 and probably could have gotten promoted to SDE 2 had I stayed, but I couldn't find teams looking for an SDE 1 at the time, so I left for non-FAANG.\n\nNon-FAANG was the best decision for my career, as I actually got the time to refine my skills and become a solid, confident engineer, and worked with probably the best team and manager of my career thus far. The only downside of this is that it did take almost until year 5 of my career to get promoted to SDE 2, as I look at several of my friends' LI profiles at the time and realized that they were starting to get senior roles. I left last year for FAANG-2, and due to the perfect storm of personal life circumstances, lack of interest in cloud computing, and lack of responses for internal transfers, I am now applying for jobs.\n\nMy problem is that whenever I do reach out to recruiters, I always get bucketed into the Senior role with my YOE. I have plenty of design and E2E project experience, and can articulate what I've done, how I've done it, what my impact was, and challenges and compromises I faced along the way. The biggest issue I have though is that I don't have experience with large-scale designs (like leading the charge building a service or adding a large product feature), and I have only mentored one person at my last job (though it was a very good quality mentorship that went above and beyond what was expected of me). Because of these gaps, I feel like I am at a disadvantage compared to those with these on-the-job experiences.\n\nI recognize there is more than one \"way\" to be a Senior engineer (via deep technical expertise). However, I also in general don't feel ready to be at the Senior level, and this is what I hate the most (maybe it's lack of confidence based on comparing myself to my friends, idk). There came a point where I clearly felt like an SDE 2 (despite my title at the time) given my accomplishments, and I have not reached that point for being a Senior Engineer **yet**. The general consensus I am getting is that SDE 2s at most companies are usually between 2-5 years of experience, and senior is 5+.\n\nAnd worst of all, the system design interviews are a different breed of difficult. I applied to all senior positions except the one I am at now at end of 2021 and I did not pass a single System Design interview. It may be a matter of more and better prep, but they are definitely more difficult than any leetcoding I have ever done.\n\nI guess my question now is, where do I go from here? Should I try to apply for SDE 2 roles or just prepare like hell for a Senior role?\n\nAny advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

        "text": "I have 6+ years exp and have specialized over the last few years into backend stuff.\n\nI have been struggling at my current job because I have had consistently crappy assignments and keep getting reassigned before I can accomplish anything. The worst of them have been projects that required a vastly different skill set than what I have. Sometimes it's working on compliance stuff with absolutely no coding, or sometimes it's frontend React stuff even though it's been years since I did anything like that and we have better people for it (short handed after layoffs, smh). The one project that I was excited about in the last 6 months got tabled before I could finish it.\n\nBasically it's been over a year since I had a really solid, visible win. I have contributed in many ways but it's been in support roles, mostly.\n\nAnyway I am really tired of not being able to accomplish things that make me feel like I have earned my salary. It is so demoralizing to be lacking that satisfaction for so long and also be put on projects I am woefully unqualified for and basically set up to fail.\n\nI try really hard not to let it impact my confidence. I think I am a pretty good engineer on the backend. I care a lot, I try to be fully invested in my projects and in professional standards, etc. I have the technical chops to match other  Senior devs on my team, etc. \n\nBut I have lost all motivation. My current project is nothing but React code/front end tooling, which I hate working on and actively avoided for years so I don't know what I am doing. I can barely muster the effort it takes to do anything. As a result, I find myself checking out and not getting much done.\n\nIt's frustrating because my job's requirements seem to change overnight depending on whatever hole in our workforce needs to be plugged. Layoffs have only made it worse.\n\nSo tell me, am I being entitled? Should I just suck it up and do the job the best I can no matter how futile it seems? Or do I have a legitimate reason for being completely fed up?",

        "text": "I’m asking Reddit for their opinion on a recent change in my department. I work at small department where a coworker from\nHelp desk recently moved to. He joined and was promoted to the same title as me (which I’m currently being paid on the lower end). I don’t have a problem with this coworker he’s a great asset and will still retain a number of functions from his previous role. Similar to me, I do a lot of things from my old role too, however i was in my old role for four years not one (like this coworker).\n\nMy question is; is this a good or a bad thing for my own career? Now there’s two of us with the same title, a part of me thinks this legitimizes the role more, the other side diminishes it. I was planning on asking for a raise this spring and with a new team member would this make it harder?\n\nThanks for your input everyone",

        "text": "I've got an offer from a job that seems awesome. I've asked for three weeks to notify my current job. I want the three weeks so I can still get my bonus earned from last year. To be honest my family needs it badly.\n\nThey want me to start sooner and have offered a sign on bonus but it's half of what I would be getting for last year's earned bonus at my current company.\n\nThey're kind of acting like I'll lose the position if I don't take the sign on and start sooner...?\n\nThe place checks all the boxes. Remote, pay increase, tech stack that I want to work with and excel at. I'll be one of two devs and working 1:1 with the senior dev. I'm mid-level hoping to work up to Sr level in this tech stack.\n\nI don't want to lose the chance but I also want to 1) give the two week 2) wait for my earned bonus and not put more pressure on the new job by getting a bonus because of the rush to get me in the door. Seems like pressure I'm trying to avoid at my new job.\n\nI've heard I can take FMLA (we are caring for my mother after a procedure next week I had already planned to take the time off) that could prepare my company to backfill my position and allow me to work the new job while waiting on my bonus.\n\nI wish I didn't need to worry about them pulling the bonus for LAST year's work.. but that's the situation we're all in for now. And I'm just trying to figure out how to keep my family afloat without going through much more stress.\n\nI'm the only breadwinner and my current employer has run me through the dirt. I'm definitely feeling burnout and concerned about feeling that again somewhere.\n\nThe new place seems so chill because it's a small team. I really want that but not at the expense of over 5 grand my family needs right now...",
