It got me thinking if there is a sports movie that doesn't have a montage of sorts. I'm pretty sure it helps progress the story if there is one so if it isn't there, it could kill the story.\n\nCan anyone think of one?",

Dame says he was just a kid when he made that decision to pull a gun but he is committing crimes very quickly after release.\n\nI'm guessing that Adonis likely wouldn't tell Viktor or the authorities about what Dame did. And it would be difficult to prove Dame arranged that assault (especially if it was Dames friend and not a hired payment). \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

The Fabelmans - I’m a sucker for Spielberg and “for the love of art” movies\n\n4. Tar - such a shame that “Apartment for sale” didn’t get nominated. \n\n5. Women Talking - total Oscar bait film but the stellar ensemble cast did it for me. \n\n6. All Quiet on The Western Front - also Oscar bait but loved the cinematography. \n\n7.  The Banshees of Inisherin - In Bruges is one of my all time favorite movies so I was a little disappointed that I didn’t love this one. \n\n8. Top Gun: Maverick - I would have rated this higher if it wasn’t for the completely unnecessary love plot. \n\n9. Avatar: The Way of Water - beautiful visuals but the plot was garbage. \n\n10. Elvis - fell asleep watching it. Do not recommend!",

The incident has never been revealed publicly.\n\nWhen contacted, the now 26-year-old former actress, whom THR is not identifying at her request, declined to address the matter except to note that she’s recently hired a lawyer to explore legal action against the actor as well as her parents.

Truth is, the Academy Awards usually don't recognize the genre Bette Davis' film belonged to and she didn't win any of the major pre-awards. Anne Bancroft was always the front-runner for THE MIRACLE WORKER. Also, Bette Davis wasn't even good as Baby Jane Hudson. Her performance was campy and overdone which is why it became popular in the gay community for the camp value. A great performance? Bette Davis gave stronger performances in films like THE NANNY or even CONNECTING ROOMS during the same era.",

        "text": "I live in Germany and Tár just came out here last week. Something that really struck me as odd is that, when strangers in Berlin approach Lydia, they use \"Fräulein\" to get her attention in the same way that you'd use \"Ma'am\" or \"Miss\" in English.\n\n\"Fräulein\" is not a word that's used anymore. I'm a woman and if someone called me \"Fräulein,\" I would punch them in the mouth (not really but I'd be highly offended). As an English equivalent, it's kind of like calling someone \"Missy\" but worse because people still say \"Missy\" in English whereas truly no one in Germany says \"Fräulein\" unless they're looking to get slapped. In the movie, even though Lydia is this super masculine character, she doesn't react at all to being called \"Fräulein\" and acts like it's a normal thing even though it's not normal at all and an real person would have been insulted. \n\nThere are so many German names in the credits that I find it hard to believe not a single one said something and I guess it would technically work with the theme of femininity vs masculinity... There are some other language things that make me think it was just an accident (\"Du siehst besser aus, wenn du lächelst\" being translated as \"You're the most beautiful person in the world\").\n\nI can't find anyone else online who has pointed this out but I guess that makes sense given the movie has only been out in Germany for approximately 10 minutes. Did any German people actually work on the script or did they write it all in English and then use DeepL or something to translated the German lines^(1)? Do you guys think it's a mistake or intentional? \n\nAlso what on earth is up with the feet? They clearly mean *something* but I'm too stupid to figure it out.\n\n1: \"Fräulein\" literally means \"Miss\" and sometimes when I give my information to a company in English and they later email me in German, it'll be addressed to \"Fräulein MyName\" because they literally just ran the English email through Google Translate. Ditto for when I give my information in German and later get emailed in English, it'll frequently be addressed to \"Mrs. MyName\" because \"Frau\" is literally \"Mrs\" even though it's actual meaning is \"Ms.\" So if they were using \"Miss\" in the script and then just ran it through Google Translate/DeepL, I can 100% believe that they got \"Fräulein\" as the translation and if no one involved with the script spoke German, obviously they wouldn't have known better.",

        "text": "I read Theo James might be running to play George Michael, Jacob Elordi will play (again?) in an upcoming film. \n\nI have mixed feelings about it because yes, it's acting, however as a gay viewer, I must say the majority of straight actors playing gay are often clueless, they are terrible whenever they have to do any intimate scenes and it's often awkward to watch. Yet those same actors are praised for being brave and doing the least. \n\nYou know who I found terrible? Matt Damon in BEHIND THE CANDELABRA, yet he got a Emmy nomination. Michael Douglas couldn't do the voice and was on the verge of a SNL sketch. \n\nSome straight actors do a wonderful job like Tom Cullen in WEEKEND, I was genuinely surprised to find out he was straight with how convincing he was. \n\nNevertheless, I'm aware for a gay film to be made, one has to cast a heterosexual actor, someone famous, so it can get financing and distributing. Rupert Everett's film, THE LOST PRINCE, about Oscar Wilde, nobody saw it. Who knows how successful it might have been had Tom Holland played Bosie? \n\nThe argument I get is, if straight actors can't play gay, the same applies to gay actors playing straight. True, except how many gay actors get to play the straight male lead in a romantic mainstream film? \n\nMatt Bomer never stood a chance at playing Christian Grey, I even recall Brett Easton Ellis saying he couldn't play Christian because he was gay. Luke Evans, though he's often sidelined as the villain. \n\nThe more famous gay actors stick to playing gay and they never get the good parts. You'll never see Billy Porter cast as Bayard Rustin or Little Richard (who was played by heterosexual actor Leon). He'll get to play the token screaming queen in a chick flick.",

        "text": "So this happened a few years ago. I have been seeing previews and commercials for a movie called “A Cure For Wellness”. The movie looked interesting so while my partner and I were browsing for a movie to watch on a Friday night, I saw that it was streaming, so suggested that we watch it. We start, and everything is going good, but about 30 minutes into the movie my partner asked if it looked familiar. I said maybe, but could have been from the previews I watched. Another 15 minutes pass, and he says that he thinks we have seen it already. I ask him if he remembers how it ends, and he says no. I also don’t remember, so we decide to continue watching until we can recall the ending. An hour and a half in, we are pretty sure we have seen it, but still continue, because we cannot remember the ending. It wasn’t until there were 30 minutes left that we remembered that yes, we did indeed watch it a few months ago, but apparently the movie was so unimpressive, we didn’t even realise we watched it for like 2 hours. What was your most unimpressive movie experience?",

        "text": "Been to a movie lately? Have you noticed the music in the trailers seem to all follow the same formula? \n\nCue Johnny Cash, “I hear the train a comin’, it’s rolling round the bend…” it’s familiar but off. A stripped down hint of the original song starts playing while the trailer begins. By the time the trailer is over “Folsom Prison Blues” has transformed from a minor remix into an operatic ghost of the original song. Barely recognizable, it’s a new song altogether at this point. Do the intentions of the writers matter in this sense? Would Johnny Cash care? Does it even matter to a dead man? I understand why studios do this, obviously it must test well. I assume they make these choices more based on data then actual aesthetic preferences, because how else could you explain the utter fucking stupidness of this trend. A majority of the trailers I now see will use this same ploy to emphasize the grandiosity of this film that will undoubtedly take something you thought was safe and flip it on its head. You’ll definitely get you $20 worth /s.\nI guess it’s an effective marketing tool, otherwise they wouldn’t be using it so much, but if I hear another Nirvana song with a backing orchestra played over the trailer of the next Batman movie Im going to lose my gd mind. \nA better alternative would just be new, original music. There are hungry musicians out there with creative minds being ignored. \nThis trend is oversaturated at this point, time to move on.",
