[{"title":"Frequently Asked Questions and Information Thread","author":"BitcoinIsTehFuture","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/js6jft\/frequently_asked_questions_and_information_thread\/","text":"This FAQ and information thread serves to inform both new and existing users about common Bitcoin topics that readers coming to this Bitcoin subreddit may have. This is a living and breathing document, which will change over time. If you have suggestions on how to change it, please comment below or message the mods.\n\n-----\n\n**What is \\\/r\/btc?**\n\nThe \\\/r\/btc reddit community was originally created as a community to discuss bitcoin. It quickly gained momentum in August 2015 when the bitcoin block size debate heightened. On the legacy \\\/r\/bitcoin subreddit it was discovered that moderators were heavily censoring discussions that were not inline with their own opinions.\n\nOnce realized, the subreddit subscribers began to openly question the censorship [which led to](http:\/\/archive.is\/0G8az) thousands of redditors being banned from the \\\/r\/bitcoin subreddit. A large number of redditors switched to other subreddits such as \/r\/bitcoin_uncensored and \/r\/btc. For a run-down on the history of censorship, please read [A (brief and incomplete) history of censorship in \/r\/bitcoin by John Blocke](https:\/\/medium.com\/@johnblocke\/a-brief-and-incomplete-history-of-censorship-in-r-bitcoin-c85a290fe43) and [\/r\/Bitcoin Censorship, Revisted by John Blocke](https:\/\/medium.com\/@johnblocke\/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64). As yet another example, \\\/r\/bitcoin [censored 5,683 posts and comments](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/noncensored_bitcoin\/comments\/7414nf\/september_2017_stats_post\/) just in the month of September 2017 alone. This shows the sheer magnitude of censorship that is happening, which continues to this day. [Read a synopsis of \/r\/bitcoin](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BitcoinMarkets\/comments\/6rxw7k\/informative_btc_vs_bch_articles\/dl8v4lp\/) to get the full story and a complete understanding of [why people are so upset](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KarmaCourt\/comments\/5gvqf6\/and_now_for_something_completely_different_the\/) with \\\/r\/bitcoin's censorship. Further reading can be found [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/83vgdm\/a_collection_of_evidence_regarding_bitcoins\/) and [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/cpftea\/its_important_to_remember_the_past_and_show\/ewp7abj\/) with a giant collection of information regarding these topics.\n\n-----\n\n**Why is censorship bad for Bitcoin?**\n\nAs demonstrated above, censorship has become prevalent in almost all of the major Bitcoin [communication channels](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/5mxov4\/wtf_north_koreas_cgc_tries_to_control_bitcoin\/dc78hwl\/). The [impacts of censorship in Bitcoin](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/5cxx8t\/the_impacts_of_censorship\/) are very real. \"Censorship can really hinder a society if it is bad enough. Because media is such a large part of people\u2019s lives today and it is the source of basically all information, if the information is not being given in full or truthfully then the society is left uneducated [...] Censorship is probably the number one way to lower people\u2019s right to freedom of speech.\" By censoring certain topics and [specific words](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/5vr7ij\/partial_list_of_words_that_automod_removes_from\/), people in these Bitcoin communication channels are literally being brain washed into thinking a certain way, molding the reader in a way that they desire; this has a lasting impact especially on users who are new to Bitcoin. Censoring in Bitcoin is the direct opposite of what the spirit of Bitcoin is, and should be condemned anytime it occurs. Also, it's important to [think critically](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/5txje0\/edward_snowden_the_answer_to_fake_news_is_not\/) and [independently](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/9cm3nj\/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad\/), and have an open mind.\n\n-----\n\n**Why do some groups attempt to discredit \\\/r\/btc?**\n\nThis subreddit has become a place to discuss everything Bitcoin-related and even other cryptocurrencies at times when the topics are relevant to the overall ecosystem. Since this subreddit is one of the few places on Reddit where users will not be censored for their opinions and people are allowed to speak freely, truth is often said here without the fear of reprisal from moderators in the form of bans and censorship. Because of this freedom, people and groups who don't want you to hear the truth with do almost anything they can to try to stop you from speaking the truth and try to manipulate readers here. You can see many cited examples of cases where special interest groups have gone out of their way to attack this subreddit and attempt to disrupt and discredit it. [See the examples here.](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/9cm3nj\/psa_the_sub_has_been_under_attack_by_various_bad\/)\n\n-----\n\n**What is the goal of \\\/r\/btc?**\n\nThis subreddit is a diverse community dedicated to the success of bitcoin. \\\/r\/btc honors the spirit and nature of Bitcoin being a place for open and free discussion about Bitcoin without the interference of moderators. Subscribers at anytime can look at and review the [public moderator logs](https:\/\/modlogs.fyi\/r\/btc). This subreddit does have [rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/wiki\/index#wiki_rules_for_this_subreddit_.28also_in_the_sidebar.29) as mandated by reddit that we must follow plus a couple of rules of our own. Make sure to **[read the \/r\/btc wiki](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/wiki\/index)** for more information and resources about this subreddit which includes information such as the benefits of Bitcoin, how to get started with Bitcoin, and more.\n\n-----\n\n**What is Bitcoin?**\n\nBitcoin is a digital currency, also called a virtual currency, which can be transacted for a low-cost nearly instantly from anywhere in the world. Bitcoin also powers the blockchain, which is a public immutable and decentralized global ledger. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without the need for any central authority whatsoever. There is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank. Read the Bitcoin whitepaper to further understand the schematics of how Bitcoin works.\n\n-----\n\n**What is Bitcoin Cash?**\n\nBitcoin Cash (ticker symbol: BCH) is an updated version of Bitcoin which solves the scaling problems that have been plaguing Bitcoin Core (ticker symbol: BTC) for years. Bitcoin (BCH) is just a continuation of the Bitcoin project that allows for bigger blocks which will give way to more growth and adoption. You can read more about Bitcoin on [BitcoinCash.org](https:\/\/bitcoincash.org\/) or read [What is Bitcoin Cash](https:\/\/www.bitcoin.com\/info\/what-is-bitcoin-cash) for additional details.\n\n-----\n\n**How do I buy Bitcoin?**\n\nYou can buy Bitcoin on an exchange or with a brokerage. If you're looking to buy, you can [buy Bitcoin with your credit card](https:\/\/buy.bitcoin.com\/) to get started quickly and safely. There are several others places to buy Bitcoin too; please check the sidebar under brokers, exchanges, and trading for other go-to service providers to begin buying and trading Bitcoin. Make sure to [do your homework first](https:\/\/www.bitcoin.com\/get-started\/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-exchange\/) before choosing an exchange to ensure you are choosing the right one for you.\n\n-----\n\n**How do I store my Bitcoin securely?**\n\nAfter the initial step of buying your first Bitcoin, you will need a Bitcoin wallet to secure your Bitcoin. Knowing which Bitcoin wallet to choose is the second most important step in becoming a Bitcoin user. Since you are investing funds into Bitcoin, choosing the right Bitcoin wallet for you is a critical step that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. [Use this guide to help you choose the right wallet for you](https:\/\/www.bitcoin.com\/get-started\/how-to-choose-the-right-bitcoin-wallet\/). Check the sidebar under Bitcoin wallets to get started and find a wallet that you can store your Bitcoin in.\n\n-----\n\n**Why is my transaction taking so long to process?**\n\nBitcoin transactions typically confirm in ~10 minutes. A confirmation means that the Bitcoin transaction has been verified by the network through the process known as mining. Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or double spent. Transactions are included in blocks.\n\nIf you have sent out a Bitcoin transaction and it\u2019s delayed, chances are the [transaction fee](https:\/\/bitcoinfees.cash\/) you used wasn\u2019t enough to out-compete others causing it to be [backlogged](https:\/\/jochen-hoenicke.de\/queue\/#0,24h). The transaction won\u2019t confirm until it clears the backlog. This typically occurs when using the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain due to poor central planning.\n\nIf you are using Bitcoin (BCH), you shouldn't encounter these problems as the block limits have been raised to accommodate a massive amount of volume freeing up space and lowering transaction costs.\n\n-----\n\n**Why does my transaction cost so much, I thought Bitcoin was supposed to be cheap?**\n\nAs described above, transaction fees have spiked on the Bitcoin Core (BTC) blockchain mainly due to a limit on transaction space. This has created what is called a fee market, which has primarily been a premature artificially induced price increase on transaction fees due to the limited amount of block space available (supply vs. demand). The original plan was for fees to help secure the network when the block reward decreased and eventually stopped, but the plan was not to reach that point until some time in the future, [around the year 2140](https:\/\/wiki.bitcoin.com\/w\/Controlled_supply#Projected_Bitcoins_Long_Term). This original plan was restored with Bitcoin (BCH) where fees are typically less than a single penny per transaction.\n\n-----\n\n**What is the block size limit?**\n\nThe original Bitcoin client didn\u2019t have a block size cap, however was limited to 32MB due to the Bitcoin protocol message size constraint. However, in July 2010 Bitcoin\u2019s creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced a [temporary 1MB limit](https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/p\/bitcoin\/code\/103\/tree\/\/trunk\/main.h?diff=515630145fcbc978e39dbaa5:102) as an anti-DDoS measure. The temporary measure from Satoshi Nakamoto was made clear three months later when Satoshi said the block size limit can be [increased again by phasing it in](https:\/\/archive.is\/L5yvP#selection-3315.0-3315.7) when it\u2019s needed (when the demand arises). When introducing Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list in 2008, Satoshi said that [scaling to Visa levels](https:\/\/www.mail-archive.com\/cryptography%40metzdowd.com\/msg09964.html) \u201cwould probably not seem like a big deal.\u201d\n\n-----\n\n**What is the block size debate all about anyways?**\n\nThe block size debate boils down to different sets of users who are trying to come to consensus on the best way to scale Bitcoin for growth and success. Scaling Bitcoin has actually been a topic of discussion since Bitcoin was first released in 2008; for example you can read how Satoshi Nakamoto was [asked about scaling here](https:\/\/www.mail-archive.com\/cryptography%40metzdowd.com\/msg09964.html) and how he thought at the time it would be addressed. Fortunately Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth and by the year 2013, scaling Bitcoin had became a hot topic. For a run down on the history of scaling and how we got to where we are today, see the [Block size limit debate history lesson post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/61mxuj\/block_size_limit_debate_history_lesson\/).\n\n-----\n\n**What is a hard fork?**\n\nA hard fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules which is accepted by nodes that have upgraded to support the new protocol. In this case, Bitcoin diverges from a single blockchain to two separate blockchains (a majority chain and a minority chain).\n\n-----\n\n**What is a soft fork?**\n\nA soft fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules, but the difference is that nodes don\u2019t realize the rules have changed, and continue to accept blocks created by the newer nodes. Some argue that [soft forks are bad](https:\/\/medium.com\/@octskyward\/on-consensus-and-forks-c6a050c792e7) because they trick old-unupdated nodes into believing transactions are valid, when they may not actually be valid. This can also be defined as coercion, as [explained by Vitalik Buterin](https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2017\/03\/14\/forks_and_markets.html).\n\n-----\n\n**Doesn't it hurt decentralization if we increase the block size?**\n\nSome argue that by lifting the limit on transaction space, that the cost of validating transactions on individual nodes will increase to the point where people will not be able to run nodes individually, giving way to centralization. This is a false dilemma because at this time there is no proven metric to quantify decentralization; although it has been shown that the [current level of decentralization will remain](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/5fyve1\/fallacy_the_key_to_bitcoins_decentralization_is_a\/) with or without a block size increase. It's a logical fallacy to believe that decentralization only exists when you have people all over the world running full nodes. The reality is that only people with the income to sustain running a full node (even at 1MB) will be doing it. So whether it's 1MB, 2MB, or 32MB, the costs of doing business is negligible for the people who can already do it. If the block size limit is removed, this will also allow for more users worldwide to use and transact introducing the likelihood of having more individual node operators. [Decentralization is not a metric, it's a tool or direction](https:\/\/twitter.com\/lopp\/status\/693537120351293440). This is a good video describing the direction of [how decentralization should look](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7S1IqaSLrq8).\n\nAdditionally, the effects of increasing the block capacity beyond 1MB [has been studied](https:\/\/www.cryptocoinsnews.com\/cornell-study-recommends-4mb-blocksize-bitcoin\/) with results showing that up to 4MB is safe and will not hurt decentralization ([Cornell paper, PDF](http:\/\/fc16.ifca.ai\/bitcoin\/papers\/CDE+16.pdf)). Other papers also show that no block size limit is safe ([Peter Rizun, PDF](https:\/\/www.bitcoinunlimited.info\/resources\/feemarket.pdf)). Lastly, through an informal survey among all top Bitcoin miners, many agreed that a block size increase [between 2-4MB is acceptable](http:\/\/archive.is\/U3dqr).\n\n-----\n\n**What now?**\n\nBitcoin is a fluid ever changing system.

They are here to profit off you. They don't care about you in the least\n- Since **gambling with your money** apparently gives a lot more profit than just collecting trading fees, exchanges prefer to just do that. \n- In fact, traditional banks have been doing the same for **centuries**, for which reason this white-gloved crime has been legalised as a thing called **\"fractional reserve\"**\n- Exchanges have been caught trading against their customers. Multiple times. So if you think you are clever and you can play against the other players, remember that **house always wins**.\n- When the above do not give enough profit in sufficiently short time, many exchanges also choose to **run off with your money** (via scam, hack or bankrupcy) instead of running a semi-honest business\n\n-------------------\n\nBitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) have been designed precisely to **combat all of the above**, so think what you are doing when holding crypto on exchange. You're **not** actually **using** cryptocurrency, you're using a **new banking system**.\n\nAgain as always, the basic rule is *not your keys, not your coins*. \n\nIf you don't have the **keys** to your crypto, **you do not have any crypto**.

Fundamentals matter, because at the end of the day it HAS to work.\n\nAnd while that's absolutely necessary, it's not sufficient to succeed. It needs to be dead simple. Let me take you back to the mid eighties, when everything was command line, and there was basically no reason to own a mouse.\n\nIt was technically possible to do LOTS of things on a computer. They were extremely powerful tools, even back then. You just had to devote several years of your life to learning how to make them work.\n\nWithout actually making computers more powerful, the introduction of a graphical user interface meant that all of those things that were possible, but out of reach of ordinary people were suddenly simple.  You didn't have to read the manual, you could just figure it out by clicking around. Despite his faults I think it was Steve Jobs who coined the \"grandma test\" and insisted that the original ipod only had one button.\n\nAmazon and every other E-tailer learned long ago that every button click you put between a customer and their purchase reduces the chances they'll buy ANYTHING dramatically. We can't force people to use crypto on our terms, you have to meet them where they are.  They're lazy. They don't want to learn about your new app. They want something that makes their life easier, not harder. Even a TINY barrier to entry will keep most people away. The more seamless the better.\n\nFunction is useless without design. It is not an afterthought, it's not less important, it is just as critical as the underlying technology. If it's not easy to use it's basically pointless tech because it WILL NOT be widely adopted. Obviously, tech comes first, but I think we're at a point now that it makes a lot of sense to put more focus on ease of use, interfaces, etc.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678301829.0},{"title":"Buy BTC iwth 10$","author":"SchwarzeFlagge","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/11mvgvx\/buy_btc_iwth_10\/","text":"I only have 10$.

Unfortunately, because of the store's limitations, the only way I can accept funds is through PayPal.\n\nThis was never an issue before because if I get a sale today, I withdraw the PayPal USD through a local bank in my country (South Africa) and I have access to my local fiat currency within 3 days. Well, my local bank who is the only bank to partner with PayPal here had massive system failures over the past 2 weeks which caused my fund to be 'held hostage' and they wouldn't take any accountability. It was terrible, I couldn't pay my bills or buy food but I eventually got my money 2 days ago.  \n\n\nI posted about this frustration here on Reddit and a very generous, kind human tipped like $10 in protest of PayPal through a bot called u\/chaintip which makes use of BCH. Another kind human tipped me $2 as well. I was super skeptical about it but when I sent my receiving address, I had the funds in seconds.  \n\n\nI then sent it to a local wallet with little to no fees and I literally have access to use the funds locally in my country within HOURS. As you can imagine this is mind blowing to me because I don't know much about crypto but once someone paid me in bitcoin - took forever, and the fees were gross, so I never tried again.   \n\n\nAll of this got me thinking and wondering if there are any job boards\/websites or subreddits I can look at in future to find freelance graphic design and\/or music work.   \n\n\nGraphic design work = branding, logos, website design  \n\n\nMusic work = making beats, instrumentals, jingles, ghost writing, etc.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678098605.0},{"title":"Bitcoin Cash Weekly News By Satoshi's Angels For March 6 2003","author":"satoshis_angels","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SatoshiAngels\/status\/1632659520118984705","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678092234.0},{"title":"Yuga Labs\u2019 TwelveFold Bitcoin NFTs Sell Out In Minutes, Fetching Over $15M","author":"itsmeamirax","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/11kslel\/yuga_labs_twelvefold_bitcoin_nfts_sell_out_in\/","text":"*  Yuga Labs bitcoin NFT auction on Ordinals sold out in minutes.\n* The 300 TwelveFold NFT collection raised more than $15 million from the auction.\n* The highest bid for a single NFT was 7.1159 BTC.\n\nStory: [https:\/\/www.nftgators.com\/yuga-labs-twelvefold-bitcoin-nfts-sell-out-in-minutes-fetching-over-15m\/](https:\/\/www.nftgators.com\/yuga-labs-twelvefold-bitcoin-nfts-sell-out-in-minutes-fetching-over-15m\/)","upvote_ratio":0.42,"created_utc":1678174067.0},{"title":"President Bukele Explains How El Salvador Benefited From Legalizing Bitcoin - Finance Daily","author":"Ozobanyi","url":"https:\/\/financedaily.site\/president-bukele-explains-how-el-salvador-benefited-from-legalizing-bitcoin\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678166972.0},{"title":"Bitcoin Cash neon sign [stable diffusion art]","author":"AD1AD","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BchStable\/status\/1632298648796102656","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678086064.0},{"title":"A Focus on the Bitcoin Cash Ecosystem: 07 CashTokens","author":"GeneralProtocols","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/zrzvh4virwla1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678016722.0},{"title":"\"My CashTokens Webwallet now uses the @ChaingraphCash demo instance to query onchain token information!

The rise  of Bitcoin and other digital currencies have brought the world a step  closer to a decentralized economy. However, with so many digital  currencies out there, it's hard to tell which one is right for you. In  this post , we'll explore why BitcoinCash is more than just a  cryptocurrency exchange. It's a complete solution.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/u6eiukh0kbka1.png?width=1599&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bbe7e96838cda5efc8f03614f2854eba96f1a3f4\n\n# BitcoinCash is a digital currency that was created to solve some of the  problems that Bitcoin was facing. Its main goal is to provide a fast,  secure, and reliable payment system that can be used by anyone, anywhere  in the world. Unlike Bitcoin, BitcoinCash has larger block sizes, which  means that it can handle more transactions per second.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zem4akx2kbka1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6949914616daeb717fae04496ae6638d783cd82b\n\n# But BitcoinCash is more than just a cryptocurrency. It's a complete  solution that includes a wallet, a payment gateway, and an ecosystem of  developers, merchants, and users who are working together to make  BitcoinCash the go-to digital currency for everyday use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/03vq50qvkbka1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=86841f597c9e90022faf856318587a849c0720d1\n\n# With BitcoinCash, you can make fast, secure, and low-cost payments to  anyone, anywhere in the world. Whether you're sending money to a friend  or paying for goods and services online, BitcoinCash makes it easy and  affordable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yn9tyrwykbka1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9a148cbe93645d0d892dcd02df142c259d2162e9\n\n# And because BitcoinCash has a growing ecosystem of developers,  merchants, and users, there are many innovative applications being built  on top of the BitcoinCash blockchain. From decentralized marketplaces  to social media platforms, the possibilities are endless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iw33y8p1lbka1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d5d4e1ea17230bafbaa0e998714f1ea08c88c12\n\n# BitcoinCash is also a great option for merchants who want to accept  digital payments. With BitcoinCash, merchants can enjoy fast and secure  transactions without having to pay high fees or worry about chargebacks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zdgdpsn3lbka1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=55345cfb0b35b1eca169b053573a30b1aafdcafc\n\n# And if you need to convert your BitcoinCash into cash, you can easily do  so at a BitcoinCash ATM or through one of the many exchanges that  support BitcoinCash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g895nmi6lbka1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=64776a00a869e0abcaa9dcf773c9d432e6c44835\n\n# But perhaps the most exciting thing about BitcoinCash is the community  that surrounds it. BitcoinCash has a passionate and dedicated community  of users and developers who are committed to making BitcoinCash the best  digital currency for everyday use.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w6kql6gilbka1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c3c2a602deba472cc55efa9160c88f6c22540dfc\n\n# In conclusion, BitcoinCash is more than just a cryptocurrency exchange.  It's a complete solution that includes a fast, secure, and reliable  payment system, a wallet, a payment gateway, and a growing ecosystem of  developers, merchants, and users. So if you're looking for a digital  currency that can do it all, look no further than BitcoinCash.","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1677324642.0},{"title":"BitcoinCash\u2026The Best or Nothing!","author":"Wide_big_tall","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/w7zifpguw9ka1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1677286149.0},{"title":"Young Americans for Liberty promoting BCH: \"End the Fed.\"","author":"Mr-Zwets","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/YALiberty\/status\/1629141603863371776","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677253804.0},{"title":"Interview with Mathieu Geukens, Developer of the First Web Wallet with CashTokens Support","author":"alberdioni8406_","url":"https:\/\/read.cash\/@alberdioni8406\/interview-with-mathieu-geukens-developer-of-the-first-web-wallet-with-cashtokens-support-a91c525b","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677247773.0},{"title":"Now you can swap coins via The Invisible Internet Project - I2P","author":"Trocador_App","url":"\/r\/Monero\/comments\/118m3o1\/now_you_can_swap_coins_via_the_invisible_internet\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677260671.0},{"title":"Honest question: name one use case for Lightning Network that isn't handled better by (unbroken) L1 + regular Satoshi-style payment channels","author":"jessquit","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Jessquit2\/status\/1629058985004306433","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1677239741.0},{"title":"What are the best places to visit in BCH City Townsville?","author":"minimalB","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/11apcym\/what_are_the_best_places_to_visit_in_bch_city\/","text":"I\u2019ll be in Townsville shortly - what are the best bars and restaurants to visit that are known for taking BCH?

The basic idea behind the Merkle tree proof of reserve is to create a cryptographic hash of all the assets held by a platform, and then provide a mathematical proof that the hash is valid and corresponds to the actual assets held by the platform.\n\nThere are several reasons why the Merkle tree proof of reserve is important for holding crypto assets on any platform:\n\nTransparency: The Merkle tree proof of reserve provides a transparent way to verify that a platform holds the assets it claims to hold. The hash and proof can be publicly shared and audited by anyone, which helps to increase trust in the platform and reduce the risk of fraud.\n\nSecurity: By using cryptographic hashing and proof techniques, the Merkle tree proof of reserve provides a high level of security against tampering or manipulation of the asset holdings. This helps to ensure that the assets are safe and secure on the platform.\n\nFlexibility: Because the Merkle tree proof of reserve is a standardized technique, it can be implemented on any platform that holds crypto assets. This makes it easy for investors to verify the asset holdings of different platforms and choose the one that best meets their needs.\n\nEfficiency: The Merkle tree proof of reserve can be generated and verified relatively quickly and easily, which makes it an efficient way to provide proof of asset holdings. This can help to reduce the administrative burden and costs associated with holding crypto assets on a platform.\n\nOverall, the Merkle tree proof of reserve is an important tool for anyone who wants to hold crypto assets on any platform. It provides a transparent, secure, flexible, and efficient way to verify that a platform holds the assets it claims to hold, which helps to increase trust and reduce the risk of fraud.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1677086356.0},{"title":"The NFC backup card mentioned in the BCH podcast is recoverable by anybody, or is the backup encrypted?","author":"deojfj","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/118s3ri\/the_nfc_backup_card_mentioned_in_the_bch_podcast\/","text":"In the podcast (#72) Jonathan Silverblood mentions he built an NFC card to backup his BCH wallet with one click.\n\nHowever, does the NFC card store it in plain text, thus being recoverable by a thief?

So they pay money mules to deposit amounts of cash into bank accounts and then wire it in batches to where they want it.\n\nThe thing is governments have caught onto this and are cracking down on it https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Structuring \n\nSo criminals and others are always looking for new alternative ways to launder cash into the banking system.\n\nOne way that this might be possible (for educational purposes only) is in illiquid stocks that do not track their NAV and have no intention of doing so either. This provides an option for money mules to buy an illiquid stock high, sell it low, and rebuy it high again (meanwhile the receiver of the funds buys their sales low and sells high), to repeat this over and over. \n\nIn fact because this is hidden in trading the stock market, they might not even have to bother using small mules, but rich whales might be bold enough to structure these transactions and do private OTC trades, so there isn't even a market trade taking place, which could potentially interfere with this laundering strategy. Since these trades supposedly occur on the open market, the launderers will obviously claim these are just bad trades, and the government cannot do anything about this.\n\nAn example of where such a strategy might be taking place is on a crypto stock like Ticker: BCHG that has completely lost its peg to the underlying assets held in the fund (NAV), and goes up and down, yet on occasion has millions of shares traded with no market movement at all (likely OTC trade arranged by 2 private parties that never actually occurred on the market). \n\nAll these guys have to do is:\n\n Put the price at $1 - Money launderer buys 5 million shares for $5m\nPut the price at $0.5 Money launderer sells 5 million shares to Kingpin for $2.5 M\nPush the price to $2 Money launderer buys the shares back for $10M - transfer of $7.5M has been completed and no one even suspects this has occurred. \n\nThis is just one example, this could occur on multiple illiquid pairs and money launderers can launder all they want everyday, rinse and repeat.\n\nThe SEC gives 0 fucks. This isnt even on crypto exchanges but on regular brokerage accounts.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1676774509.0},{"title":"#BitcoinCash save the day -Just happened today","author":"Nabzzzzz00","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/115p7ch\/bitcoincash_save_the_day_just_happened_today\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ujq53m0r70ja1.jpg?width=566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=22acf938a6c97af606ce065c4fbc7d9f7141be07\n\nAlain, is on his scooter \ud83d\udef5under the rain, driving from Hospital\ud83c\udfe5 where his mother is sick\u2192driving his scooter\ud83d\udef5 to meet the crypto exchange guy. Alain needs \ud83d\udcb0 money, he cannot withdraw from his \ud83c\udfe6 bank account. #BANK seized his money \ud83d\udcb3 just like all lebanese struggles. His mom at the \ud83c\udfe5 hospital, Alain need money for hospital- He called\ud83d\udcf1 his friend who lives in #Africa asking help for a small amount of \ud83d\udcb0 money. His friend already has financial issues\ud83d\ude33 plus he cannot, AT that MOMENT send him Via Western union or OMT ( money transfer). BUT!! His friend holds-Bitcoin cash\ud83d\udc9a- problem is that Alain doenst have any idea about cryptocurrency\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. So friend from  Africa, contact \ud83d\udcf1his friend DwellersArt who lives in #Lebanon -to help Alain with this process and search for crypto buyer. So the 3 together they were able to find a Crypto buyer\/exchange Near to where Alain lives and hospital. It took an hour maybe a bit more to find someone\ud83e\uddd0 in Alain area that wanted to buy crypto.-finally we was able to contact someone,  It was a girl: so we explain to her the situation\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f, she gave us her Brother contact, to help with the process. We end up making a beautiful circle connected all 5 people together to be able to solve Alain's issue using BitcoinCash.. Its dark now with very bad weather and we didn't imagine that this could be solved in such a short time. Then he went to meet the crypto Girl at the same time in contact with her Brother. Alain met the girl and he TRADED \ud83e\udd1dhis BCH with cash money and drive back to the Hospital. All this happened in 1hour or a bit more! But it felt like a full day, BCH is rugged. Feels like Bitcoin cash is for the streets and impossible missions, it doesn't feel like a currency with value!!  It feels like an instrument, a tool or solver during a hard time.

One solution that could potentially provide an answer is the adoption of digital currencies, such as Bitcoin Cash. However, convincing Lebanese people to adopt this new technology can be challenging. Here are a few easy ways to persuade people in Lebanon to embrace Bitcoin Cash.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/n7xb3fal7yha1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6e9e846a52934cc6be8a161b05ea664fe3a4a29e\n\nFirstly, educate them on the benefits of digital currencies. Bitcoin Cash transactions are faster, cheaper, and more secure than traditional banking methods. In a country where the banking system is failing, Bitcoin Cash can provide a more stable and reliable financial infrastructure. Furthermore, digital currencies are decentralized, which means that they are not subject to the corruption and mismanagement that have plagued the Lebanese banking system.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o31aofnq7yha1.png?width=3602&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cb124f6b99462b4ac6a1b6fa05757ce203486ce7\n\nSecondly, address common misconceptions about cryptocurrencies. Many people in Lebanon are skeptical of digital currencies because they do not fully understand how they work. Highlighting the fact that Bitcoin Cash is a legitimate form of payment that is recognized globally can help alleviate these concerns. Assure them that it is a safe and secure way to store and transfer funds.\n\nThirdly, show them how Bitcoin Cash can be used in their everyday lives. Encourage merchants and businesses to accept Bitcoin Cash as a form of payment. This will create an environment where the use of Bitcoin Cash is more widespread, making it easier for individuals to adopt it. Additionally, it can help to build trust in the technology and increase awareness of its benefits.\n\nFourthly, highlight the potential for investment. Bitcoin Cash is a digital asset that has the potential for growth in value over time. In a country where the local currency is rapidly losing value, investing in a digital asset that is not subject to inflation can provide a secure store of value.\n\nFinally, make it easy for people to adopt Bitcoin Cash. Provide easy-to-use resources and tutorials on how to set up a digital wallet and purchase Bitcoin Cash. Encourage the use of mobile applications that make it easy to use and manage the currency on the go.\n\nIn conclusion, convincing Lebanese people to adopt Bitcoin Cash is not an easy task, but it can be achieved with the right approach. Education, addressing misconceptions, showing real-world use cases, highlighting investment potential, and making it easy to adopt are key components to a successful adoption campaign. With the right effort and resources, the adoption of Bitcoin Cash in Lebanon could help provide a stable financial infrastructure and offer a solution to the economic crisis.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1676290951.0},{"title":"Purse.io - why the stagnation and lack of order-clearing?

The user contacted us mods, and we determined that they're shadow-banned by Reddit.\n\nI don't see a reason why the poster's question should not be discussed in this sub, so I'm reposting on their behalf.\n\nNote: due to the shadow ban, I think OP might not be able to reply to comments. Still, let's give it a go.\n\n---\n\n> Purse admin friends, fellow users, I'm trying to figure-out why Purse still has rookie errors so many years later. I've used Purse.io since the end of 2018. I've probably filled orders as an Earner hundreds of times (sometimes $4,000 computers and other items), and I've used it a little as a Buyer.\n\n> My gripe is this order right here:\n\n> RATE PRICE BCH AMOUNT SHOPPER RATING 5% $80.72 0.53988258 rogerkver 445\n\n> This order has been at the top of my Purse filter for weeks. https:\/\/purse.io\/earn\/bch#country=US\n\n> The total is $80.72 for three t-shirts.\n\n> When you get to checkout with the gift registry address selected, the order total is $85.27 instead, and you can't even order the t-shirts because the order is set-up incorrectly:\n\n> \"We're sorry. This item can't be shipped to a Wish List or gift registry address.\" (red text)\n\n> I've accepted and cancelled this order many times, over the weeks. I've put the info in the comments box about why (too high of actual price, and unable to order).\n\n> This still shows-up in my Purse list, even though sometimes it is greyed-out.\n\n> It's happened in the past for a day or 2, but somehow those orders have usually gone away. There seems to be no algorithm\/system\/auditor checking Purse to see why people are cancelling orders. Also, how hard would it be to have a bot simulate an Amazon order, compare it to the price entered by the prospective Buyer, and cancel the order if they don't match?\n\n> This makes me use Purse.io less, because there seems to be less and less support. I've had my issues over the years, but I've always had timely support by staff, and I've never been scammed (I also am very cautious and only fulfill certain orders).\n\n> Anyone speculate or give actual feedback on why Purse seems forgotten in the past couple months? I really want Purse to succeed, but failing at basic things is pretty weak-sauce after being around for several years. Do we need new staff, more staff, a better supervisor, a rival site...what?\n\n> Happy 2023 to my favorite r\/btc sub by the way, belated!","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676280784.0},{"title":"FattouhCrypto Free Sessions..","author":"Nabzzzzz00","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/pq1ebhhtdzha1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1676286977.0},{"title":"State-backed Crypto Mining Farm under Construction in Russia\u2019s Buryatia \u2013 Mining Bitcoin News","author":"Martinjoesph","url":"https:\/\/news.bitcoin.com\/state-backed-crypto-mining-farm-under-construction-in-russias-buryatia\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1676308423.0},{"title":"Do you guys know why bitmain was in favor of the hard fork in 2017?

One wonders if Lebanese miners would share a similar fate.\n\nAre there any substitutes for diesel when the fuel runs out?\n\nThere are two substitutes: UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) and computer batteries.\n\nThe former device allows a computer to keep running for a short time when its primary power source is lost while providing protection from power surges. Meanwhile the batteries supply energy for two-to-three hours. Both devices can be purchased from local and international manufacturers (mainly China), but because of skyrocketing demand on behalf of crypto miners and dealers, they are constantly in short supply.\n\n\u201cDemand for UPS and batteries have certainly soared at our company,\u201d said an employee who works at a Lebanese hardware manufacturing company. The employee wished to remain anonymous.\n\n\u201cWe used to have orders of about three containers of UPSs per week, and now our orders are up to 12 containers a week. We can\u2019t keep up with all that supply.\u201d The employee added that she was worried that very high demand may translate to an increase in hardware prices, as was the case with GPUs in the last two years.\n\n\u201cCustomers used to be able to import GPUs from the US for $300 in 2019. Now the prices are bordering $1,200 per GPU,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is getting more expensive for mining. I wonder if it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, if one were to add up the many costs of mining mentioned in this article and compare them to the meager income of $5 every four hours (as mentioned above), the numbers certainly don\u2019t add up.\n\n\u201cI wish I wasn\u2019t so hasty in my insistence to risk everything I have and give mining a shot,\u201d said 28-year-old Sary Mohsen. Mohsen had sold two iPhones in order to buy two GPUs. \u201cI joined a mining pool three months ago, right before bitcoin crashed, and things have been downhill ever since.\u201d\n\nIndeed, bitcoin\u2019s decline in the past few months saw its value more than halve since its April peak of $63,745, falling below $30,000 on July 21. Bitcoin has since rebounded and was trading at $41,695 on July 31.\n\nAnother source of worry for miners who want to cash out but fear they will be missing out if bitcoin\u2019s value rises again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I cashed out my bitcoin when it was at its peak in [April],\u201d a miner who goes by the gaming nickname Commando1 told The New Arab. \u201cToday all bitcoin owners have no choice but to wait and hope bitcoin\u2019s value rises again. I don\u2019t envy their situation.\u201d\n\nIf anything is keeping the youth in Lebanon hopeful about mining, it\u2019s desperation and fear from the looming specter of unemployment and financial crisis. Whether all their efforts to keep their mining boat afloat turns out to be worth it, however, remains to be seen","upvote_ratio":0.65,"created_utc":1676121101.0},{"title":"Revolutionizing Payments with BCH: Paytaca's Mission to Bring Decentralized Money to the Masses","author":"alberdioni8406_","url":"https:\/\/read.cash\/@alberdioni8406\/revolutionizing-payments-with-bch-paytacas-mission-to-bring-decentralized-money-to-the-masses-5c568917","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1676089394.0},{"title":"Tipping on Reddit (or anywhere else) without a tip bot? Yes, it is possible! [practise thread]","author":"LovelyDayHere","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/10z0bvq\/tipping_on_reddit_or_anywhere_else_without_a_tip\/","text":"Since the chaintip bot is currently down (apparently suspended by Reddit with an appeal to resume service in progress), I thought I'd open a discussion post on alternatives that people can use to tip BCH for good content on Reddit and other sites.\n\n__Update: Looks like u\/chaintip is back :) But for future outages, this info below will still be helpful to you.__\n\nThis sub, and others, have a 'no begging' rule, so I'm not going to suggest anybody post comments in subreddits soliciting tips for anything (at least not without discussing with the mods of such subs to make sure it's not against sub policy).\n\nThis post is about what we can do to \n\n1. receive BCH tips if someone else wants to tip you\n\n2. how we can tip others for content which we like\n\n---\n\nAll of the ways I'm going to talk about here, require that you have a Bitcoin Cash address on which you can receive tips.\n\nThis Bitcoin Cash address should be in a wallet that you control directly.\n\nNot an exchange wallet or custodial web wallet, meaning someone else controls they keys (and your coins). That would be bad.\n\nSo, if you do not have a Bitcoin Cash wallet yet, that is your First Step.\n\nI recommend https:\/\/electroncash.org as a wallet, but you can browse around to find something that suits you best.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bestbchwallets.com\n\n---\n\nSo you've created a receiving BCH address (bitcoincash:....) in your wallet and made sure you have your wallet seed backed up securely. Good!\n\n---\n\n__Making sure people can find your address for decentralized tipping__\n\nNaturally, if someone wants to tip you on Reddit or elsewhere, they can just ask you for your tipping details. You could give them a bitcoincash: address, but that's a very long string of letters and numbers.\n\nHow to make it easier for them? \n\nGet an easy to remember tipping name or URL. One that is easily identifiable and memorable as belonging to you, so next time they will remember to find the info easier.\n\nThere are two ways I know (but if someone knows more, please leave a comment!)\n\n1. Register a CashAccount.  You can do this via Electron Cash (Tools -> Register Cash Account) or via https:\/\/cashaccount.info (Registration) . I recommend the Electron Cash route, since it's so easy. Either way, you will need a tiny amount of Bitcoin Cash in your wallet to register a CashAccount. Once you're done, you will have a simple CashAccount name you can share with others. It will look something like `LovelyDayHere#215700`. They can look up 'LovelyDayHere' on https:\/\/www.cashaccount.info as well, to confirm.  You can stick your CashAccount in your social media profile and people can quickly find it, then they can get the associated BCH address with an easy lookup (e.g. from inside Electron Cash or other good BCH wallets).\n\n2. You can get a https:\/\/tipb.ch tipping URL like https:\/\/tipb.ch\/LovelyDayHere . If someone visits that URL they'll see the address and QR to send tips to you. Registration is extremely easy (you only need a name, a BCH address and an email address for managing your account, but this account doesn't keep your coins. It is only for managing linked tipping URL pages, of which you can register multiple. Optionally, you can also associate a SmartBCH address with a page, but I'm not going to get into that now (or until SmartBCH has a decentralized and working bridge, really).\n\nOnce you've set up one or both of the above ways for people to tip you, they can quite easily do it.\n\ni should point out that while https:\/\/tipb.ch is a neat concept, the names are kept in their database which isn't openly published afaik. So it's centralized - it's not possible for other people to easily create another copy of the site (e.g. with a different prefix).\nCashAccounts are really decentralized because the information is registered on the blockchain, thus totally public, and can be looked up or added to by anyone.\n\n---\n\n__If you want to tip someone on social media__\n\n1. Tell them you appreciate their post\/comment, and that you'd like to send them a Bitcoin Cash tip. If they don't want it, respect their wish, thank them and leave it be.\n\n2. If they are receptive, and you know they have used BCH before, you can ask them whether they have a CashAccount or tipb.ch page that you can use to tip them. If they don't know what these are, then you have a great chance to familiarize them with these helpful tools. Show them the websites, and show them your own CashAccount and tipb.ch page so they see what it looks like in real life.\n\n3. If they've never used BCH before, then you have a chance to introduce them to it. Beware that in some subreddits or other platforms, this may not be welcome in all conversations. So be mindful of the environment and possible preference of the counterparty for a private context (or public links) to learn more information about BCH first before accepting they decide if they want to accept a tip.\n\n4. Encourage them to use their own non-custodial wallets. This is important, because otherwise tips may 'never show up' if an exchange refuses to credit it to a custodial account, and the chances that they'll be able to get an exchange support to fix that is small. Besides, tips sent to an exchange account are already not really their coins, they belong to the exchange and lots of bad things could happen with those coins. It's a good opportunity to teach people the value of holding your own coins. It's also important that they do not need to collect their tips in a hot wallet. They can generate a tipping address once, back up their wallet seed securely, and as long as they don't need to spend those tips, the wallet can be completely offline.\n\nAlright folks.\n\nLet's practice!","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1676056673.0},{"title":"I have created a new directory for Bitcoin Cash because it seems that acceptbitcoin.cash is no longer maintained properly, swan.cash is gone - list your BCH-related websites and social media profiles here for free","author":"georgengelmann","url":"https:\/\/bchgang.org","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1676047543.0},{"title":"A Fun Reminder lol.","author":"EvAng3l1on","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/ghmr62fujbha1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1676023508.0},{"title":"FTX\u2019s new boss says security was so weak that founders could \u2018download half a billion dollars\u2019 of crypto without detection","author":"Mental_Character7367","url":"https:\/\/skymagzines.com\/ftxs-new-boss-says-security-was-so-weak-that-founders-could-download-half-a-billion-dollars-of-crypto-without-detection\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1676046468.0},{"title":"recently dl'd the btc Blockchain on a HDD from windows and want to use it on a ras pi. can I do this without redownloading?","author":"Revlonrevolver","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/10z9irp\/recently_dld_the_btc_blockchain_on_a_hdd_from\/","text":"Hello,\n\nI recently downloaded the btc Blockchain to a 2tb HDD from a windows machine.

Let's examine how the world will change when CBDCs become prevalent.\n\nNot everybody has realized that effectively money has been electronic for 10+ years in industrialized countries. Cash is used in less and less daily commerce, and large financial transactions are almost always electronic in this day and age. Buying a new car or house with cash immediately arouses suspicion with the IRS or other legal entities. It's illegal to travel internationally with more than $10k. One of the main reasons to implement CBDCs is to ban cash. Countries like Sweden have mostly eliminated cash, except in rural areas. No cash means that people must be on the CBDC system to have any money at all. Given the recent moves by government to coerce people with lockdowns, vaccine mandates, and digital ID, making the entire money supply centrally controlled by government is truly terrifying. However, CBDC is only a continuation of a 20+ year trend of increasing government and banker control of the world's wealth. Consumers in most industrialized countries have tacitly accepted that they don't own their money under the guises of convenience and safety.\n\nChina's digital Yuan CBDC has already been launched. This enables the Chinese government to bypass US government sanctions on SWIFT, formerly the only system which could transfer large amounts of money internationally. Basically the digital Yuan breaks the USA's monopoly on international banking. For Chinese consumers, the CBDC is total hell, all transactions are permissioned and tracked. The digital Yuan even has an expiration date (as will the British CBDC) - if you don't spend your money before that date, it goes away! This would effectively mean the end of saving, nobody could get ahead. Your rights to spend CBDCs as a consumer could likely be regulated by AI, for example you can't buy anymore alcohol after you've reached your monthly purchase quota. The possibilities are endless for government to control and mold the behavior of its citizens.\n\nCryptocurrency is uniquely positioned to prevent the worst outcomes of CBDCs. When cash is banned, many people will move to crypto to exercise their financial autonomy. Many are already buying crypto, gold, and silver to preserve their wealth and avoid electronic fiat. Also, crypto will likely serve as an intermediary between CBDCs, as the USA is unlikely to allow free exchange of the Chinese CBDC for the US version. Finally, censoring crypto transactions (other than ETH) will be difficult or impossible for governments.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1675895611.0},{"title":"5 Essential Reasons to Buy Bitcoin & Become Your Own Bank","author":"Crypto_Mining_","url":"https:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=6ypUjlOO8vk&feature=share","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.25,"created_utc":1675962995.0},{"title":"Bombshell in Web3: GetBlock Partners with Pocket Network, Advances RPC Node Services","author":"getblockio","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/10xu6rm\/bombshell_in_web3_getblock_partners_with_pocket\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\n[GetBlock x Pocket Network](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/drd0zf6av5ha1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=df5b069c6b9e280ac70be242513a9da9755b1085)\n\nStarting from Q1, 2023, two blockchain infrastructure majors will be working together to offer cutting edge nodes to a new generation of cryptocurrency protocols.\n\nAs the integration goes live, the customers of [GetBlock](https:\/\/getblock.io\/) and [Pocket Network](https:\/\/www.pokt.network\/) will enjoy enhanced RPC APIs toolkit.\n\nThe new partnership is set to allow GetBlock and Pocket Network to share computational resources with each other with focus on new products and features for users.  \n\n\nDo you use RPC providers for your development?","upvote_ratio":0.13,"created_utc":1675947657.0},{"title":"Marc de Mesel: The Key Of CryptoWorld","author":"Nabzzzzz00","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/10xe2iv\/marc_de_mesel_the_key_of_cryptoworld\/","text":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xha299kzn1ha1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=752aff0689f1f8d7a251327c119c627d35939f2a\n\nI never thought that I would find myself in the world of  cryptocurrency, let alone invest in digital currencies.

However, many industries have been  reluctant to adopt cryptocurrency as a payment option because of the  uncertainty surrounding it. The restaurant industry is no exception.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that most restaurant owners have reservations  about accepting Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for payment. Yet,  with time comes knowledge and understanding. This article will  demonstrate how cryptocurrencies offer more benefits than drawbacks if  you own a restaurant.\n\n**Easy To Use**\n\nCryptocurrency is easy to use and understand. It can be used to pay  for food and beverages in the restaurant. It is also easy for both the  restaurant owner and the customer. For instance, if you have a small  business then it will be easier to accept them as a payment method  because they do not require bank accounts or credit cards.\n\nIn addition, your customers\/clients will be able to use  cryptocurrencies without having any prior knowledge about them. All they  need is a good cryptocurrency exchange to buy crypto from\u00a0and a crypto  wallet to store them in. Some of the good exchanges include OKX,  Coinbase, and Finance.\n\nFurthermore, this means that there are no transaction fees involved  when accepting cryptocurrencies as payments which makes them  cost-effective compared with other payment methods such as debit cards  or credit cards.\n\n**Less chance of fraud** \n\nThe biggest benefit of cryptocurrency as a payment option is its  ability to eliminate fraud. With cryptocurrency payments, there is no  need for a middleman like Visa or MasterCard. It\u2019s just the customer and  restaurant exchanging money directly without any third party involved  in the transaction. This not only saves you time but also saves you from  paying the high fees that most credit card companies charge merchants  every time they process a transaction.\n\nAdditionally, there is no risk of identity theft since your personal  information is not shared with anyone else when using cryptocurrencies  such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Moreover, with\u00a0blockchain technology being  used by cryptocurrencies, users can be sure that their funds cannot be  hacked into by cybercriminals since all transactions are recorded  publicly. It\u2019s on an immutable ledger which gets updated every 10  minutes so that any attempt at tampering with it would immediately get  noticed by other node operators on the network.\n\n**No interference from middleman**  \n\nOne of the most important benefits of accepting cryptocurrency  payments is that you don\u2019t have to pay any commission to the middleman.  In other words, there is no need for a third party like banks, PayPal or  Stripe as they would charge you some amount as per their agreement with  your customers. It means that you can save money by not paying them  these commissions and can spend it on things that matter more for your  business growth.\n\nThe transactions are direct between the customer and restaurant  without involving any third party which makes them faster, easier, and  cheaper. In addition, since there are no intermediaries involved in the  transactions, your funds will reach your bank account immediately after  payment has been made by customers using cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), etc.\n\n**Digital transactions are always safe** \n\nCryptocurrency  transactions are highly secure, irreversible, and transparent. The  transactions are also secure because of the use of cryptography. Digital  blockchain technology uses cryptography to make sure that the user  cannot double-spend their money or fake their identity during a  transaction. \n\nCryptocurrency is being accepted as a valid payment method by many  companies today including Amazon and Starbucks which shows how popular  this digital currency has become over time. Many benefits come with  using cryptocurrency over cash or credit cards which makes it an ideal  choice for paying at restaurants such as McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Taco  Bell, etc.\n\n**Real-time transaction**\n\nOne of the most promising features of using cryptocurrency as a  payment option is that transactions are real-time. In other words, there  is no need to wait for your transaction to be approved by a third party  nor wait for it to be recorded on any centralized database. This  feature eliminates much of the frustration associated with traditional  payment methods, particularly when paying at restaurants.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies become more popular, many people have started  using them instead of fiat currency at restaurants and cafes due to  their convenience and speed. With this method, you can pay for your meal  in less than a second without having to wait for approval or validation  from any third parties, which ultimately means faster service times.\n\n**Cryptocurrency is the need of the hour for restaurant owners and restaurant workers** \n\nCryptocurrency is the need of the hour for restaurant owners and  restaurant workers. With its convenience, ease of use, safety, and  security, real-time transactions, accessibility across countries, and  absence of a middleman in its transactions, cryptocurrency has become  popular among all kinds of businesses.\n\nRestaurant owners can easily accept payments via cryptocurrencies  without worrying about any kind of fraud or misuse as it is completely  secure. Moreover, there is no need to worry about fluctuations in price  because when you receive your payment in cryptocurrency you are assured  that you will get exactly what was agreed upon at the time of the  transaction.","upvote_ratio":0.58,"created_utc":1675859494.0},{"title":"Mempool transaction getting pushed back","author":"fatchicken1204","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/10wmx1x\/mempool_transaction_getting_pushed_back\/","text":"I might just be impatient, but my mempool transaction gets to the first block, than gets pushed back to the last. this has been happening for like four hours where is says like 5 minutes left. if there anything i can do?\n\nIf it stays unconfirmed, it says it will be returned to \"your\" wallet, but I bought it so wouldn't It just go back to the seller? did I just lose my money?  \n\n\nI'd appreciate any help. thanks.\n\nEdit it went through","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1675829509.0},{"title":"General Protocols: Navigating the Shift to Programmable Money and DecentralizedFinance on BCH","author":"alberdioni8406_","url":"https:\/\/read.cash\/@alberdioni8406\/general-protocols-navigating-the-shift-to-programmable-money-and-decentralizedfinance-on-bch-25443bd1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1675822680.0},{"title":"Speculation About the BTC \"Taproot Wizards NFT\" Fiasco","author":"wtfCraigwtf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/10wk9h1\/speculation_about_the_btc_taproot_wizards_nft\/","text":"SUMMARY OF THE SITUATION\n\nBy now most have probably heard that a group active on Twitter known as \"Taproot Wizards\" have exploited the new ordinal functionality of the Taproot upgrade to insert a 4MB jpg image into the BTC blockchain. My opinion is that this is basically **blockchain vandalism,** and I don't believe it's worth discussing if there are any potential merits to this.  The debate about storing images and other garbage data on a permissionless distributed database has already been flogged to death many times on Bitcoin forums over the years, and the conclusion is almost always \"do that shit on another blockchain\".\n\nWhen crap is added to BTC's blockchain, thousands of Bitcoin nodes are force to download and store images (so-called \"NFTs\") that look like they were drawn by a child, it's a nuisance, and it's a pointless waste of resources. More importantly, **critical block space** that could and should be used for BTC transactions is **wasted**. This causes fees to rise and the BTC mempool congestion, which slows down valid transactions. Of course this will also make opening and closing Lightning channels more difficult and expensive. We all know that BTC's blocks are far too small, making it extra vulnerable to full blocks. In 2017, when the BTC blocks were completely full for a month, and fees rose to as high as $1000 per transaction. People who didn't pay high enough fees sometimes had to wait TWO WEEKS for their transactions to confirm. Did I mention that BTC price dumped from $19k to $4k in a week? There is a very real risk that this could happen again.\n\nThe Taproot Wizards paid zero fee onchain to the miner who added the this \"NFT\" to the BTC blockchain. This is suspicious, because it's very rare to see a giant BTC transaction mined without a fee. It likely means that the miner is actively collaborating with Taproot Wizards, and is likely being compensated in another way for their mining. This also implies that the group is composed of industry insiders who have connections to big miners. Update: Udi Wertheimer is the Taproot Wizard, the pool was Luxor: [https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/giant-bitcoin-taproot-wizard-nft-165023492.html](https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/giant-bitcoin-taproot-wizard-nft-165023492.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKh1-_-jzjiotvAB413YoIsYMxOjWHdw44bD1080NUvQkSUX0m4YiUzo17dBirobOCO4kmud44_xRcqdx6mr0OFI1OHCKUd7FDQAgVD4Y8zmNMvXjLGSsQFkUYN_0idEmBTs-9KJaNaTYEt0imu8EwHapF8O1ZiAQg_Rphu99v2j)\n\nSPECULATION\n\nI can't imagine that the Blockstream Core BTC dev team didn't see the potential for this exploit. In fact there are discussions on their mailing list about putting limits on ordinal use. It seems that they ignored the warnings and steamed ahead, knowing that someone could start spamming the BTC network with giant useless transactions. Precisely this has happened many times in the past, and it's a known attack vector. Then again, you shouldn't attribute malice where incompetence is a possible cause. Coincidentally, a Craig Wright lawsuit against 16 Bitcoin devs and personalities is going to trial soon.\n\nWhich brings us to the speculation portion of the thread: Could this be a pretext for the Blockstream devs to do an emergency hard fork? Could they have some sneaky code changes prepared that need to be rammed through the miners quickly, under the guise of an emergency? Could they even be prepared to **increase BTC blocksize**, after all the interminable years of  yammering about small blocks? Or is this just another Blockstream\/Core anti-feature like Segwit and RBF, created to break Bitcoin yet again? I'll be watching the story closely this week for clues...\n\nMaxies are getting roasted.\n\nEDIT: User grmpfpff has the most plausible theory on this, namely Blockstream is creating a pretext to censor BTC transactions. ETH is already censored, BTC is next?\n\nAnother plausible theory is that this is BTC miners trying to drive transaction fees to the moon. They're not doing too well mining so they could use some more revenue. Also, when fees rise astronomically, fungibility is drastically reduced. You can't move any UTXO worth <$100 if fees are >$100.","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1675821986.0},{"title":"BCH Wallet Concept Interface","author":"tunaplex","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/bzn6tgdewsga1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675790754.0},{"title":"Breaking: Deutsche Bank\u2019s Asset Management Arm Eyes Crypto Investments","author":"Exitmorelikeentrance","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-02-08\/deutsche-bank-s-dws-in-talks-to-invest-in-crypto-firms-dda-tradias","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1675876072.0},{"title":"(Monday) Soooo, Binance will suspend all US dollar transfers effective tomorrow.

Lebanon is always ready to go along with  the latest and strangest global trends. New phenomena such as mining and  helium have begun to spread, and fear has begun to escalate from the  impact of these two phenomena on its digital security, the fragile  Internet situation in it, and the electrical network, which suffers from  what it suffers from. Has Lebanon entered the stage of digital risks,  or is it a new door for financial benefit? Warnings began to appear from  here and there, met with objections and criticism in the process of  conflicting interests and analyzes. The whole story is still new in  Lebanon, and its good from its evil has not yet emerged, despite the  intimidation of some and the reassurance of others. \u201c\n\nSince the emergence of Bitcoin, the most prominent digital currency, the  world has been divided between supporters and opponents, but this did  not prevent the rocketing rise of trading in this currency and its  transformation into a major currency in a number of countries along with  local currencies.  Based on this fact, it is possible to understand the  mining process that is being talked about today in Lebanon, as any  process of transferring a Bitcoin transaction from one team to another  is carried out through a technology known as the blockchain, and each  process that needs authentication or verification is in turn carried out  through a complex process and by means of related devices.   Sophisticated technologies require fast internet and uninterrupted high  electric power.  This process is called mining and it is carried out by  people called miners or \u201cminers\u201d who own one or more of the mentioned  devices to be able to solve complex algorithmic operations and check  more and more conversion operations so that it is possible to talk about  mining farms that include many devices and are able to  Meet larger  numbers of conversions.\n\n**\"Mining\" Farms**\n\nAs for why the name mining was given to this process, the matter is  simple and requires a little imagination, as in the mines, raw minerals  are converted into valuable pieces or coins.  Then to mining this  digital currency, that is, converting it into a real currency (in  dollars) through specialized institutions that are now present on  Lebanese soil.  Despite the high price of the device that the miner  buys, which may reach 1500 dollars, he will be able to recover its price  within six months through the profits he earns daily, and then the work  turns into a net profit that returns to its owners with a good return  of hard currency at this time.  Difficult.  This is what prompted many  Lebanese youth to invest in these devices and carry out mining  operations to collect hard currency easily and quickly without making  any effort at a time when unemployment has become the dominant position  and large numbers of the new generation are without work looking for any  source of livelihood.\n\nBut this mining process, which has become widespread in Lebanon,  poses more than one problem. The mining devices used require huge and  uninterrupted electric energy and a high consumption of the Internet.   From here the question arises, how do mining farms and miners secure  this electrical energy?  Some of them worked to provide their  headquarters with solar panels to ensure continuous access to  electricity, while many, which has become almost certain, illegally  theft of electricity and this was reflected on the network in some areas  that could no longer bear the increased pressure on them, especially as  the networks sag.  In Lebanon, it is known and taken for granted.  Some  areas and villages where mining farms abound began complaining about  the power cuts and the failure of the networks to bear the increasing  pressure on them, which forced the Electricity Company to separate some  villages in which electricity consumption increased significantly from  other villages to ensure the continuity of current access to all  villages.  It appeared in the Jezzine region in particular and some  villages in the south.\n\nAnd to confirm the ferocity of this energy monster, many countries  have banned the mining process. It is mentioned that China was one of  the first countries to prevent Bitcoin mining and destroyed all the  devices used in it and prevented its sale in China and through major  Chinese companies such as Alibaba.  For more confirmation, a frightening  figure is being traded, which is that the consumption of energy by  mining equipment in the world is equal to the electricity consumed by  the Netherlands.  How about in Lebanon, which already suffers from a  described weakness in the production and distribution of electric  energy?\n\nAs for the second problem posed, is it possible for Lebanon to bear,  in light of the deteriorating internet conditions in it and the  problems that this sector suffers from, a huge increase in internet  consumption?  Does the increase in consumption have a negative impact on  the capacity of the networks and negatively affect all users?\n\n**Helium is a new concern?**\n\nThe second issue that has begun to raise whispers and questions  recently is the helium network, which reminded the Lebanese in one way  or another of a previous communications network that, on a fateful day,  caused them a major security and political problem.  Should the helium  network and its dangers be feared, or is it still limited in problems  and does not rise to the level of risks?\n\nFirst of all, it is necessary to define what is called helium. It is a  different concept from the concept of Bitcoin mining and is linked to  what is known as the Internet of things (IOT), meaning that the world  today uses many devices and tools that need to be connected to the  Internet in order to work, such as surveillance cameras, for example,  and therefore it must be available  These things have routers that allow  them to connect to the Internet or a 3G line.  But sometimes the  Internet coverage may not be available for these things due to its  distance from the Internet source, so it was necessary to use an  alternative network known as helium.  Through this technology,  individuals can cut off part of their internet at home or on their phone  and send it to these things to secure coverage for them. This is done  through a device that distributes the cut internet power to the nearby  surroundings.  So far, nothing is illegal, because whoever shares his  energy via helium is originally paying the phone or Internet operators  for what he consumes.\n\nAnd if we want to simplify this concept, we can say that it is somewhat  close to the concept of a neighborhood generator that distributes  alternative energy to electric current, and thus thanks to helium it is  possible to secure local Internet coverage for any place that needs it.   On the other hand, it looks like a win-win process because the helium  device can also be used to mine another type of digital currency called  HNT, with which other digital currencies can be purchased or converted  into dollars.  The mentioned digital currency that is exchanged for hard  currency.  In this way, the Lebanese \u201cHarbuk\u201d had hit two birds with  one stone and was able to earn easy money while serving those around him  and perhaps getting caught from them as well (but it is still  uncertain).\n\n**The internet is choking**\n\nAfter the publication of a map of the sites where helium networks  are frequently used, it was found that most of them are located in the  south and that some of them are planted near the airport road, which  raised a major problem because it endangers the security of Rafic Hariri  International Airport and exposes the surveillance cameras in it or its  surroundings, perhaps to breach or surveillance, as it makes the  devices  That need internet is under the grip of the anonymous helium  networks that provide it with coverage.\n\nThe use of helium, like mining devices, poses more than a real  problem, the first of which is, is the entire Internet used legitimate,  or do some resort to illegal sources of the Internet that are far from  state control?\n\nThere is reason to wonder: Is the internet, which suffers mainly in  Lebanon and complains of slowness and interruption, and whose  administration today, through Ogero, complains about its inability to  operate the centers due to the loss of diesel fuel, able to withstand  the additional pressure generated by the use of helium?  In the world,  where high-speed Internet and the ability to use helium does not  constitute any problem, but could be a solution for some remote areas,  but in Lebanon, it poses a real danger to a network that suffers under a  myriad of problems and difficulties.\n\nAnd if we want to talk about the legal reality, we must ask what  laws take care of these matters today?

Right now, the BTC network is the highest-paying \"customer\" and accounts for more than 99% of sha256d miner's revenue, with BCH and few others accounting for the rest.\n\nOther thing to recognize is that mining is anonymous by nature. Pools usually write some info into their coinbase transactions (the 1st TX in a block, which pays out the reward to the miner), but they don't have to do it, and any pool can omit or forge another pool's tag. Other way to try to identify a miner is the address, but the address can also be changed for each block.\n\nOk, so anyone with access to hardware and electricity can anonymously mine, sell the mined coins for some currency (if there's a liquid market for the coin), and then use the currency to pay for his electricity bill and other capex\/opex costs. What's great about this is that you can mine from a remote location, giving you a way to \"wirelessly\" sell energy to blockchain networks. You don't need to run cables or transport a product. Also, if you're an energy producer, during times of low demand you can again sell energy to miners or mine yourself - so this can create incentive to overprovision capacity, which could be of interest to make renewable projects more big and profitable. If there will be a better use for the energy - then that better use can outbid blockchains.\n\nBlockchains are paying customers, just like everyone else. But this particular customer is convenient because energy delivery and expenditure can take place at the same location since the \"product\" being made with energy is digital. There's more on this here: https:\/\/www.bitcoinunlimited.net\/blockchain_energy_use.md\n\nIt also talks about blockchains wasting energy, argument which can be made for BTC blockchain because it has artificially capped transaction capacity to 1MB every 10-min. If you allow it to naturally scale with hardware&software capabilities, it could be much more efficient (transactions \/ kWh). BCH currently has a limit of 32MB but has been testing 256MB blocks which would be processing roughly 1000 transactions per second. Our problem is adoption... not much used - actual blocks are now around 100-200kB but our price is <1% of BTC so we're doing 10x less transactions but burning 100x less energy. Of course, with adoption the price would grow and cause more energy expenditure - and there we ought to find some equilibrium because blockchains are just 1 of many energy bidders. Solution to rising energy prices is more supply, not less demand, and blockchains have become a way of crowdfunding the supply.\n\nAlso, sha256d mining has become a huge capex and opex intense industry with thin margins. It is not survival of BTC that is at stake, but survival of sha256d miners. If BTC changed the algorithm, almost everyone invested in sha256d mining hardware would go bankrupt because it would lose a \"customer\" accounting for the biggest source of revenue. Because it's special-purpose hardware it can't be repurposed for some other coin like GPU-mineable algorithms can. And there, I feel like ASICs make it all more secure, because once you build out your business on ASIC mining - you're commited to the algorithm, and the survival of coins for your algo is in your best interest.\n\n>But I don\u2019t see the power provided becoming lower.\n\nEfficiency gains in hardware won't change the power use, they will just reshuffle the mining market. First miner to increase efficiency will get more money, add more hardware (+energy) kick out low-efficient miners (-energy) until everyone slowly gets access to the better hardware. Difficulty will increase to match new hashes\/kWh and the energy use will again be at some equilibrium with block reward market value.\n\n>Is the benefit of a distributed ledger (with proof-of-work) worth the extremely high energy use?\n\nWho's to say if it's \"worth it\"? The market votes on \"worth\" of things all the time, and by giving BTC the top market cap, it is voting that it is indeed \"worth it\" - because the market price of BTC block reward \"pays for\" the energy, if the price dropped, so would the energy use :) Even though BTC's main use of energy has become to secure \"store of value\" since it can't handle much transactions. Also, if price remained constant, the energy use would halve every 4 years (because block reward will halve, and with same price it's 50% less revenue, and mining costs would remain the same, so they'd start go offline until difficulty drops to 50% and reduces energy use).\n\nWhat PoW achieves is something that can only be achieved by PoW, it's not just about timestamping transactions which you can do with other schemes (PoS, PoA) - it's about the mining game being open and censorship-resistant. Anyone can join the mining game without asking for permission from existing players. I see PoS as convoluted PoA.\n\n>The energy required to pass fiat or even wire transfer is orders of magnitude lower than brute forcing a hash.\n\nYes, currently, and on BTC certainly. Note this: if the number of transactions increases - energy use doesn't change. So why not fit more transactions into blocks? That's what BCH wants to do.\n\n>If you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m a etherium guy :)\n\nBecause of smart contract capabilities or because you think PoS is a good idea? I'm curious - at what time did you get interested in crypto? PoW vs PoS is not new, this is a good doc written on it, 2015: https:\/\/download.wpsoftware.net\/bitcoin\/pos.pdf What people have been warning about is starting to happen, every now and then I see someone posting about Eth TX censorship.\n\n>You are still talking around my question, tho, which is maybe very idealistic, but still out there: Will humans in 100 or 1000 years laugh at our incredibly wasteful way of assuming somebody owns something?\n\nI don't know, but even if they will -- it doesn't mean we can just skip this step in human progress.\n\n>wasteful way of assuming somebody owns something?\n\nThanks to Bitcoin (the invention), I have started to think about money more abstractly - it's more like information than something that can be owned. When you send someone money, you're sending a financial message \"please make more of this\". The receiver responds by building some good or a service, to serve your fellow humans with what they say they need. And by spending the earned money elsewhere, you become a relay. By collecting money, you store up energy for some burst of broadcasting power later. The problem of current financial system is that central entities can forge the signal - they can give themselves infinite broadcasting power and so make message receivers behave irrationally. What I'm saying is - do not think of money as ownership - think of it as a signal that helps coordinate production of things we need.\n\nIf we make a metaphor of humankind as one organism, then money flows are signals between neurons (individuals), and they control what the hands do (factories etc). Human brain uses 20% of the energy, is it surprising that our civilization's brain would use a significant amount (not even close to 20%)?\n\n>The report found Bitcoin mining to consume 0.16% of global energy production, slightly less than the energy consumed by computer games, according to the BMC \u2014 and an amount it considered to be \u201can inconsequential amount of global energy.\u201d https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/btc-energy-use-jumps-41-in-12-months-increasing-regulatory-risks\n\nStill think it's waste? Is gaming a waste then, too? Is having sex for non-reproductive purposes a waste, too? Is running a marathon a waste? You don't need that much running just to be in shape. How much energy do sports events \"waste\"? Everything that makes life worth living is pretty much wasting energy :) And even when energy is used \"productively\" - to build something, the things we build generally serve to help make life easier so we can waste even more energy during our leasure time while enjoying life haha! The concept of \"waste\" is subjective, we don't have a duty to nature to spend energy this or that way - every one of us spends it how he feels like, and nobody should be guilted into feeling his use is \"waste\".\n\n>putting wealth above responsibility\n\nWealth is responsibility. The more you have the more responsibility you have. I mean, you can be irresponsible and waste it on entertainment and luxuries, but what signal does such expenditure send to other \"neurons\" in our civilization \"brain\"? The more wealth you have, the stronger your signal gets - use it responsibly.\n\n>You can\u2019t buy yourself out of some problems, yet we (humans) seem to keep doing it. I\u2019m a bit scared of this capitalist train that tells us to grow or die. Just keep the pedal to the floor and hold on to keep up. I don\u2019t see a better way, I\u2019m not saying I have an answer, but I don\u2019t feel comfortable anymore. \n\nNeither do I, but not because of capitalism - but because of those wanting to take over individual agency and make decisions for us - so we can better fit in how they think the wold should look like. The mental virus of communism has mutated and has come back to haunt us again. I reject that, and I'll work towards the world I want to see, I will not be a part of other people's plans - I will make my own plans.\n\n>Back to crypto- think about where that energy comes from. Think of energy as a resource we always think of as infinite until it\u2019s not. We\u2019re not powering our CPUs with lumber, thankfully, but we are using some seriously damaging fuel sources today.\n\nThat's true for any energy use - whether or not energy is dirty depends on supply, not on demand. We need to increase supply of renewables instead of guilting everyone into lowering demand. Why isn't more money allocated towards growing renewable supply, renewable h2 & methanol production, nuclear research, methanol engines & fuel cell tech...? Why aren't all roofs 100% covered in solars? We have a big fusion reactor that's sending free wireless energy to Earth, all we gotta do is capture it. Because the signal (money) flows have become captured by misanthropic self-serving elites who don't really want to solve problems for us. Fix the money, fix the world. So no, I don't feel bad for using a lot of energy to fix the money and then the world. The \"money\" use is our collective brain's plumbing!\n\n>And even if we had a fusion powered grid, are you comfortable knowing that the work required to sign a single block could keep a house lit up for a year?\n\nYes. It's not my energy, and it was not stolen from me nor anyone else - it was paid for by the network. It's a voluntary transaction between parties involved, who am I to judge it?\n\n>there should be some kind of 'storage' or 'potential' that can be spent to reduce entropy, thus producing work... And this is where I get very concerned about efficiency.\n\nEnergy is the potential that is able to produce work, that's literally the definition. Nothing gets done without energy. Entropy is a measure of irreversibility (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Irreversible_process), not of disorder - can you undo the work, recover the same amount of energy, and leave everything else the same? Even the most efficient machine produces entropy - any action that results in a thermodinamically irreversible change will increase entropy, doesn't matter how efficient you're at doing the change. You may locally reduce entropy (undo the work by bringing some external energy) but by doing so, the broader system's entropy will always grow because you had to take energy from it (or remain constant - which is only a theoretical possibility). Entropy is closely tied to passage of time. Without ever-growing entropy we'd be stuck in stasis. To have \"stability\" or constant entropy is to be stuck in an infinite loop: a perpetuum mobile preserves entropy but the idea of living in one is what's truly horrifying because it can't ever change it only loops internal states and never interact with its surroundings, it's more like definition of hell then some ideal to strive towards.\n\n>It does being to look like homogeneous wealth redistribution and the fight to keep inequality, just like keeping the cold out and the hot in. So seeing us creating a bunch of heat just to keep a ledger of potential sits very strangely with me.\n\nSun creates a bunch of heat just because it exists, and %99.999999 of it is \"wasted\" to outer space and is increasing entropy of our solar system faster than we ever could, at least until we build that Dyson sphere :D Things naturally cool down - everything radiates heat into the void (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Black-body_radiation). The space itself is a massive cold sink. What we get from the Sun at day, we send to outer space during night. It's the flux that helps us build stuff, we're just redirecting streams of energy and entropy to create good side-effects for us humans, we're not stopping the streams. Human experience is not some static state, it will never be \"stable\". Life itself is the experience of the flow of ever-increasing entropy. To halt entropy is to halt life. We can't fight the natural currents, we just need to learn ride the waves to have a nice existence in this huge universe we found ourselves in :) Be grateful for the wonder of life, try to enjoy it and help others enjoy it.\n\n>Your responses are extremely compelling and very well stated. I am seriously enjoying your point of view and you have given me lots to think about.\n\nThanks, I'm enjoying the talk too!\n\n{this part was later in PMs, I don't want to violate the person's privacy so I'll just copy my answers and come up with some alternative prompt}\n\n>Can we equate money with ability to produce work?\n\nwe can't really, because unlike nature where work and energy are objective measures, while value we give to products is subjective; if you do labor that nobody asked for, what is its value? not every usage of 1Joule is worth the same to humans, even if it produces exact same amount of physical work\n\nmoney really is potential, and the current of money makes things move in human society, but how much of that flow someone gets to attract to himself doesn't just depend on that someone but on perceptions of others\n\nmoney helps quantify relationships between humans, if there was just 1 human, then concept of value wouldn't exist... to have value is to be valued by others, value is a measure of relationships with other humans, not an objective measure of state\n\nYeah, I think money is more like a neural signal than something that produces work. When your brain sends an electric current to your hand, the stronger the signal the stronger it will squeeze, but it's not the signal that's providing the energy for the squeeze, it just controls the gates that direct energy\n\nso flows of money direct flows of energy, but money is not energy\n\nand like, if every energy exchange results in entropy, from the point of view of nature it doesn't care... but WE care about particular configurations of the increased entropy state.. so we direct flows of energy and entropy to create a reality nice for us\n\nso our civilization-brain is using money to create a planet-sized neural network, but the signal can still be easily corrupted because we don't have sound money... which is why I think Bitcoin (Cash) or whatever succeeds as truly decentralized p2p currency has the potential to make our civilization-brain more reasonable. Fix the money, fix the world!\n\nwhich is also why I'm with PoW... because PoS is more corruptible","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1675578686.0},{"title":"3AC and Coinflex founders complete raising $25M for new scam exchange.

I know its not complete evidence, but since the FTX collapse OKX seems to have died as well. Volume and market makers are just gone. There has to be a reason, and that likely is not a good thing for them.\n\nWe should speculate that the volume disappearing is a huge red flag (or it was fake the whole time and thats even worse), so dont deposit your money on their exchange. As we recently saw with celsius, FTX had huge lines of credit with other companies and could have shorted all sorts of crypto to nothing with paper crypto and no collateral (probably with a do not liquidate agreement similar to the one that bankrupted Coinflex), leaving these exchanges completely insolvent since FTX declared bankruptcy in 2022.\n\nOKX and FTX had strong ties and since the date of collapse their BCH pair volume had some crazy selloff and then just died. The recent recovery has been spot exchanges like Coinbase buying thousands of BCH but moving the price and market cap by huge amounts. This means futures positions are completely fucked because the market is illiquid, there are no BCH to cover the huge amounts of shorted paper BCH. This is the next Coinflex, so beware and GTFO.\n\n**Source: Go to either of these charts and click 1 Week timeframe, and look at the VOLUME the charts tell the story of this bullshit price manipulation, sure sell hundreds of millions of BCH, no shit everyone would be margin called:**\n\nhttps:\/\/cryptowat.ch\/charts\/OKX:BCH-USDT-FUTURE-BIQUARTERLY\n\nhttps:\/\/cryptowat.ch\/charts\/OKX:BCH-USD-FUTURE-INVERSE-BIQUARTERLY\n\nTLDR: OKX seems to be insolvent since the FTX collapse, and market makers are no longer there.

I've probably filled orders as an Earner hundreds of times (sometimes $4,000 computers and other items), and I've used it a little as a Buyer.\n\nMy gripe is this order right here:\n\nRATE  \tPRICE\tBCH AMOUNT\tSHOPPER\tRATING\t \n\t5%\t$80.72\t0.53988258\t rogerkver\t 445\n\nThis order has been at the top of my Purse filter for weeks. https:\/\/purse.io\/earn\/bch#country=US\n\nThe total is $80.72 for three t-shirts. \n\nWhen you get to checkout with the gift registry address selected, the order total is $85.27 instead, and you can't even order the t-shirts because the order is set-up incorrectly:\n\n\"We're sorry. This item can't be shipped to a Wish List or gift registry address.\" (red text)\n\nI've accepted and cancelled this order many times, over the weeks. I've put the info in the comments box about why (too high of actual price, and unable to order).\n\nThis still shows-up in my Purse list, even though sometimes it is greyed-out.\n\nIt's happened in the past for a day or 2, but somehow those orders have usually gone away. There seems to be no algorithm\/system\/auditor checking Purse to see why people are cancelling orders. Also, how hard would it be to have a bot simulate an Amazon order, compare it to the price entered by the prospective Buyer, and cancel the order if they don't match?\n\nThis makes me use Purse.io less, because there seems to be less and less support. I've had my issues over the years, but I've always had timely support by staff, and I've never been scammed (I also am very cautious and only fulfill certain orders).\n\nAnyone speculate or give actual feedback on why Purse seems forgotten in the past couple months? I really want Purse to succeed, but failing at basic things is pretty weak-sauce after being around for several years. Do we need new staff, more staff, a better supervisor, a rival site...what?\n\nHappy 2023 to my favorite r\/btc sub by the way, belated!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675354749.0},{"title":"Coinbase Wins Dismissal of Lawsuit Over Unregistered Securities","author":"Exitmorelikeentrance","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-02-01\/coinbase-wins-dismissal-of-lawsuit-over-unregistered-securities","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1675304312.0},{"title":"The Paytaca wallet allows you to trade directly on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain in a non-custodial manner using BCH.

Even after having been in this space for so long, I am still very cautious handling smart contracts on Ethereum. It\u00b4s just so ridiculously complex and we haven\u00b4t reached a point yet where you can blindly sign a contract and just forget about it.\n\nIt\u00b4s your responsibility to understand the basics of crypto before you start using it. And with basics I mean the basic technical understanding of how and why it actually works:\n\nWhy do some transactions have various inputs and outputs even though you just made one transaction from A to B? What is a BIP? What is a hierarchical deterministic wallet or \"HD wallet\" and why did it make Bitcoin so much more user friendly? Why does a mnemonic seed consist of a predefined set of words? Can you just use any word or do you have to comply to the limited predefined set? Why do you have to decide how much fee you are willing to pay in a Bitcoin and Ethereum transaction, but not in a Bitcoin Cash transaction? Why should you generate your seeds offline and how do you achieve that? Why does one wallet change the public key after each Bitcoin Cash transaction and the other does not? Why is there more than one public key anyways, and why is there just one private key? Why do your coins show up in one wallet and not in the other when you restore you wallet in both? So what is a derivation path and what happens if its different in one app? Why does one wallet support less coins than the other? What is a smart contract and how do you sign it? How do you get out of it? Why should I transfer my Ethereum tokens to the same address where I have my Ethereum, is that important? Why is there no block explorer for Monero? Why do some people say I should run a Bitcoin node, and others say that I can use a SPV wallet? Where is the difference?\n\nThese are all questions that you should investigate if you don\u00b4t know the answers to them. There is no hotline you can call and no bank manager that can log into his system to undo the mess you created. You make a mistake, you have to shoulder the consequences.\n\nSo consider carefully every step you do, because in crypto you do not want to mess up.\n\nThe late trend seems to be to just blame everyone else for your bad decisions, but that simply doesn\u00b4t work in the crypto space. Your decisions have real consequences when you handle crypto.\n\nIve been in this space for a decade. I have lost coins for various reasons in the past. I don\u00b4t blame anyone but my stupid self because I didn\u00b4t know better, and was not more cautious before I made the decisions I made.\n\nWhy don\u00b4t you?","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1675236461.0},{"title":"You can buy Bitcoin Cash Stickers using BCH on www.BestSellers.Cash Special discount on February 4th \ud83d\udc98","author":"FouadAbboud","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/kiboiosqjjfa1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1675223565.0},{"title":"Is anyone here playing poker with bitcoin?","author":"Forsaken-Scallion-97","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/btc\/comments\/10qqjfc\/is_anyone_here_playing_poker_with_bitcoin\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.65,"created_utc":1675249104.0},{"title":"Lebanon to devalue currency by 90% on Feb. 1, central bank chief says","author":"sandakersmann","url":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/markets\/currencies\/lebanon-devalue-currency-by-90-feb-1-cbank-chief-says-2023-01-31\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1675198079.0},{"title":".driew nioctib peeK","author":"2q_x","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/1oghquqi7ofa1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1675298005.0},{"title":"(5) In-depth Look at the Importance Of content creators in spreading The word About BCH","author":"alberdioni8406_","url":"https:\/\/read.cash\/@alberdioni8406\/5-in-depth-look-at-the-importance-of-content-creators-in-spreading-the-word-about-bch-21c3f8e3","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1675223097.0},{"title":"With Ordinals, Bitcoin miners are actually MORE incentivized to mine NFTs than actual spending transactions.

My hope is that we will release the prototype and video in the next 2 months.\n\nCheers!","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1675103909.0},{"title":"Might stick a 3GB video on BTC and concatenate it into 6000x 500KB chunks.
