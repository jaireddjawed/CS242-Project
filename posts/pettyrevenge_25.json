        "text": " This took place sometime around 2014 in a factory I worked at. Main characters are me, maintenance guy 1-Harry, maintenance guy 2-Lloyd \n\nOur breakroom got a nice big 55” TV less than a year prior to these shenanigans starting. Harry and Lloyd always went to break together at the same exact times throughout the day. They’d walk in and Harry would grab the remote from whatever  table it was sitting on, regardless of whether somebody was sitting  there, and proceed to change the TV to watch his designated show for  that break. First break was Family Feud, lunch was the local news, 3rd break was Andy Griffith show (I think, been a while), and I don’t remember what the last break’s show was. We worked 12-hour shifts, so we got 3 breaks and a lunch. \n\nNobody ever really said anything to Harry and Lloyd about it. Maybe a passive/aggressive comment once a month, but it was  obvious people weren’t happy about Harry and Lloyd thinking they owned  the TV. \n\nHere is where the pettiness starts: \n\nAround 2014 I decided to get a new cell phone. I ended up getting a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that had an IR blaster on it. One day I go into the breakroom when it’s empty and program my phone to be a remote. From this day on, I start messing with Harry and Lloyd after they come in and change the channel.  \n\nI randomly turn the TV off, volume down, change the channel, etc. The first couple of weeks, I only do it once or twice all day. Progressively getting worse as the days go on. About a month in, I’m messing with them to the point they take the remote and put it on a table in the back of the breakroom. I hear them talking back and forth about what the problem could  be, they conclude that the actual TV remote is somehow causing  interference with the TV by being so close.  Of course, as soon  as they move the TV remote, I quit messing with them. \n\nReaders, I shit you not, I continued to do this for the next 3ish years until I finally left for another job. Everybody knew what I was doing except Harry and Lloyd. Most held their laughs in, but some didn’t. It didn’t matter though; Harry and Lloyd were oblivious. \n\nThe breakroom was a rectangle. The TV was on the smaller wall, 12-15ft wide, and the breakroom was about 150ft long. The end opposite the TV had refrigerators, microwaves, vending machines, etc. Sometimes I would go to the back of the breakroom, hiding behind  the partial wall that had the microwaves on it, and mess with them where  they couldn’t see me, as to make it look less obvious it was me. \n\nI doubt they ever realized that it stopped after I had left. It was the highlight of my day. That place was terrible to work at and I’m told by people that still work there that it’s only gotten worse since I left. \n\nI’d like to add that I was pulling these shenanigans on other people as  well, most people figured out I was doing it pretty quickly.",

        "text": "So this just happened a week or so ago and it's a little bit of a complicated backstory so bare with me for a minute.\n\nI recently moved into a new apartment and the old tenant was doing some shady/illegal stuff (illegal sublet, a whole other story about that which doesn't fit this sub so won't go into much details) but a family friend was renting their apartment from them while they lived down the hall in another apartment (important for later). So when the illegal sublet was evicted they (Call them S from now on) where still renting and where now my neighbor. \n\nSo S still had the key to my mailbox and when I went to get the key from S they told me they had made a copy of the key and would like to keep using my mailbox for a little bit since their family friend was still receiving mail to my apartment (yes yes I know but at that point I couldn't do much and as a new renter/neighbor I was trying to be friendly). So I agreed and just asked that they leave any mail that was for me in my mailbox and once their family friend had sorted the mail to return they key. All in all seemed like a nice enough person.\n\nFast forward a couple months and I receive a text message from my landlord saying that she had received a text from her previous tenant, S my neighbor, complaining that my mail was in her mailbox and wasn't being removed and to fix the issue, including a picture of said mail. My landlord asked me to resolve this mail issue and I responded very confused because 1, the picture S sent to my landlord was mail I know for a fact was in my mailbox because I recognized the name (wasn't my mail to begin with) and I had been leaving it in my mailbox assuming it was for her family friend. 2 I knew it was in my mailbox because it was addressed to my apartment as well.\n\nI was just dumbfounded that S would complain and lie to my landlord when *I* was the one doing her a favor in the first place! Like it's not S's mailbox, it's mine. And why your family friend is still getting mail delivered here after more then a year (I've been there for about 7 months, plus the time it took for inspections and renovations after the eviction) is beyond me. \n\nNow I was also doubly pissed because S has my number, they live down the hall from me, why wouldn't you do the *neighborly* thing and reach out to me first before going over my head and to my landlord?? \n\nSo here's my petty revenge; along with S's family friend still getting mail sent to my mailbox, S was getting mail delivered there too! S had lived there before, idk why S never updated her mail to their new apartment a couple doors down. So I put a hold on *all* mail coming into my mailbox. I checked with the USPS and when a hold request is put in place, it's not just for yourself or you and SO, it's for any mail addressed to that address requesting the hold. Oh and the hold I requested was for 30 days, any longer and you have to fill out some special request forms or something. I don't say a word of this to S. What I've done is perfectly legal, and since S wasn't neighborly to me, why should I return the favor?\n\nNow I don't really care since I never get anything important in the mail anyway. I have everything come through electronically and tax season won't be for another couple months (those do come in the mail for me). I also requested that after the hold period is up that I go and collect all the mail in person at my local USPS. So I walk in, collect all my mail addressed to me, and anything else I write \"return to sender\" and drop off in the outgoing mailbox. \n\nHaven't heard from S at all but I can only smile when I think of them repeatedly checking the mailbox only to find it empty again and again. \n\nSorry for the long post but thought it was worthy for this sub and I finally had something to contribute!",

        "text": "A recent petty penny story reminded me of a double petty revenge which occurred in either 7th or 8th grade in the early 90s. A guy in my class asked me for a dollar with an accompanying promise to pay me back tomorrow. \n\nThe next day arrived without the money returning to my hot little hands. I started persistently asking him for my dollar, a request a day - always during our lunch period.\n\nEventually he became so frustrated with my persistence that he brought me my dollar. And here is where the first petty revenge comes: he paid me in pennies. Smug bastard smiled when he handed me the bag full of 100 copper disks.\n\nMy mind is weird, so instead of taking those pennies to a bank and exchanging them for a dollar I decided to spend them at the, for lack of the proper name, snack closet. And here comes the second petty revenge, though it was inadvertent. \n\nSee, this guy had to scour his house for 100 pennies, and he apparently had obtained some from his dad's office. His dad collected rare coins as a hobby. Now, I don't know the specifics of how this happened, but apparently this kid had gotten ahold of some rare pennies his dad had bought. Turns out I'd spent pennies valued at *much* more than 1 cent. A mutual friend told me this kid ended up being grounded as punishment for several months. I had a Coke.",

        "text": " \n\nHello!\n\nwithout  going into much detail, I work at a reasonably high end clothing store  in a major American city with a lot of tourists from around the world. Not Gucci or anything,  but it's 120 dollar pants, and 300 dollar jackets. We have some casual  items, but mostly it's business casual to suiting. Another important  point is that of the stores that still have women's suiting, we are one  of the most size inclusive. We go from 00 to 14 or 16 in store, which is  XXS to XL or XXL. We have petite and tall in the store. Online we go up  to 22.\n\nwith the background out of the way, here's the story:\n\nOne  day a couple comes in, speaking to each other in German. I speak German, and our store likes to go above and beyond to form customer relationships. I tell them I speak German, in German, so if they need any help, let me know. they wave me off, and continue talking. It's a small store, so I can hear them clearly even when I go  to work on straightening up a stack of clothing. They are now shitting  on one of my coworkers, because she was not dressed right for her  weight. mainly laughing about her sleeve length, and the fact that her  elbows were showing. IDK. people are weird and mean. She doesn't  understand because she doesn't speak German, and customer is king in a  store like this. But it is frustrating.\n\nAnyways,  this woman selects a couple shirts and goes to try them on. a little  while later, she comes to me and asks me for the next size up for a  couple shirts. I look at the tags: size 8, and our store goes up to 14  or 16 in the store. I go to search for the next size, but don't find it,  for any of these shirts.\n\nThis  woman has come right before school starts and right after the swearing  in for new lawyers, cops and citizens I think. both of these events mean  that tons of women are coming in looking for suits, and our store knows  it. there are big discounts. Additionally, it's right after the  pandemic work from home arrangements eased up. Tons of women came in  saying they're headed back to the office and needed new suits.  basically, from size 00 to 8, it was hit or miss if we had an item in  your size. Past size 10, pretty much everything was gone.\n\nSo  I go back to her, and tell her we don't have the larger sizes in store.  But that we have a full size run, including the next size up, online.  Not a lie at all, and we are encouraged to tell people about the online  store. She's shocked. this woman who was making fun of my coworker for  being overweight is now being told she's big for the clothing here. She  turns red, then huffs and leaves with her male partner in tow.\n\nI  never lied, I did as we were trained I just never explained to her,  like I do to most people, that this was a busy time, and we would  restock soon and have all the sizes back.  Part of me feels bad, because  obviously it sucks when you are too big to shop in a store. I have  family members that can only look at clothing in the stores, and then  they have to go look for the shirts online. and I hate watching how that affects them. Part of me  doesn't feel bad because honestly, if she is going to be that mean to  people, she deserves to know how it feels. particularly because those family members I mentioned? one of them does actually hate the way her elbows look, and gets really self conscious about it, wearing long sleeves no matter how hot it is. \n\nSo yeah, there's my petty revenge against this lady for being mean to others about their weight/dress.",

And I'm not sure who started it, but he and I have been butting heads ever since.\n\nHe does not interact with me unless it involves instruction or correction. No \"please &amp; thank you.\" No \"Good morning.\" just barks orders. Sometimes he even berates me in front of the other staff. \"Why did you do XYZ like this! You need to break that habit right now. I want XYZ like this! Let me hear you say it!\" But he's not like this with anyone else. Just me. Now I don't want him to become my best friend or anything, but it is quite stressful to work for a guy who only talks to you with an attitude.\n\nHe likes using antiquated systems involving actual files. Loves printing everything, hand moving physical documents, and faxing. So much paper. So much waisted time. Don't even get me started on his filing system. Meanwhile I've found ways to digitize the entire process: Excel, emails, shared documents. Saves time, so much easier, and more accurate. I'd even shared a couple sheets that I've created to make things smoother. He told me to print them. We murder some trees in this office. I think that's why he doesn't like me; I balk at his operations flow every step of the way.\n\nNow the epiphany: He can't get rid of me. I know he hates me, and maybe he's being a dick to try and get me to quit.  But he can't do it without me. And maybe it's petty of me, but if I can piss him off with just my presence, well then that makes me smile.  As much as I don't like him, I know he doesn't like me either. But I can put up with it better than he can.   I smile when he gets pissed at me.  And I still use my spreadsheets when he asks for numbers.",

We should’ve refunded them or called to get another sample. Instead of doing that a different coworker thought it was a brilliant idea to enter random results as if they were normal. She’s been at this place for like 4 years and definitely knows better. Not only are the owners getting ripped off but we could easily miss something wrong on someone’s pet. I was fuming so I sent an email to my hospital manager and supervising doctor stating it was falsifying medical records and it’s not right to owners or the pets. The doctor got back to me and thanked me for looking out for the pets and said the issue would be addressed.\n\nFast forward to this week, said coworker has been a real asshole and super short with me. I’ve been civil and choose to just ignore her but I’m tired of the attitude. I took some tuna juice we have for the cats and “accidentally” got some on her purse. I feel a Grinchy smile coming on just thinking about how mad she’ll be when she can’t figure out what the awful smell is coming from. As the title suggests, it really stinks to be a lying asshole in my presence.",

I consider A and B to be my friends and we generally live very well together. We are all a little messy in the sense that we leave clutter in our shared spaces, but as long as we generally clean up after ourselves, we don't have issues with each other. When it comes down to chores, we all work together to get some stuff done and some of us do the chores that the others don't like; for instance, A and B do the dishes because I despise them due to sensory issues, B and I do the sweeping because A dislikes it, etc. Us working together on chores is especially helpful on days where my back pain flares up particularly bad.\n\nFinals have come and gone at this point, and we all have neglected our cleaning duties. Clutter everywhere, full sink of dishes, dirty countertops, you name it. The apartment was gross and needed to be cleaned before we leave for break.\n\nOn Sunday, A decides to go home. This wouldn't be an issue, however they decided to leave all of their shit everywhere and not put away any dishes they've cleaned, or clean anything else for that matter. Whatever, B and I can handle it (we have had to talk to A about their cleanliness before, which they have improved on to a degree). However, B left today while I was out without cleaning anything or putting any of their shit away either. Meaning, I now have a whole apartment with 3 people's worth of mess to clean alone and in pain. I was already expecting to have to clean up my stuff and some aspects of our shared spaces before leaving, but I didn't expect to do all of it.\n\nNow I'm currently cleaning the apartment, but any of their stuff that I find that isn't where its supposed to be, even if I know where it goes, is going straight onto their beds for them to put away in January. Currently both beds are full of their junk that I picked up, but the apartment is getting cleaned! :)",

They are all exceptionally catty, constantly gossiping about each other, and talking out loud about a lot of inappropriate stuff (menstruating, oral sex, etc). I just keep my head down and do my work. I get it. I'm the newbie, and this is how they've always talked, as it was an all-female department before I started.\n\nThere is one coworker I'll call her Lexi, who is all over the place. Consistently late, over-dramatic about everything, gets in little spats with everyone. I've always been cool and professional to her, and for the most part she's been fine with me. Except for this recent incident.\n\nThe dress code here is already casual. However my coworkers celebrate Friday as casual-casual Friday. In other words, they come to work in pj's, super low tops, basically whatever they want. Again I keep my head down and my eyes to myself. But I guess this recent Friday, I was looking in Lexi's direction? I honestly wasn't even trying to look at her but I guess she thought I was staring at her cleavage. n front of everyone, she calls me out and asks what I'm staring at. I tried to tell her I was actually looking out the window (there's a garden out there and I was watching a ground hog), but she didn't really seem to believe me, although she instantly dropped it.\n\nWell, a few hours later I'm called into HR. They tell me Lexi reported me for sexual harassment, said I was staring at her breasts all day long (not even close to being true), and how I being very creepy and making all my coworkers uncomfortable. I was instantly seeing red. I told HR all about the inappropriate things they discuss in the department. I also went off about how their dressing is super unprofessional, how it makes our company look unprofessional, and how they are the ones putting me in an uncomfortable position.\n\nThe next day, an email was sent out announcing a dress code change. Everyone was to now dress at least in business casual. A specific emphasis was put on low cut tops not being acceptable. I'm sure everyone thought it was in response to my \"creepy staring\", but I knew it was because I turned the complaints around and pointed out how ridiculous things had gotten.",

To prevent theft, many gas stations and convenience stores don't accept large bills, particularly at night.\n\nAnyways, there was this guy who'd always come in, buy a Scratch-n-Lose ticket, scratch it on the spot (right in the way of other customers, if there were any), and cash it in if he won.  He'd usually buy some other stuff too, like cigarettes, etc.  He was generally quite rude, particularly if my friend asked him to step aside to let other customers move up; he was *certain* that *this* ticket would be a winner, and he didn't want to have to line up to cash it in.\n\nOne day he comes in, pays his last $5 or whatever for the ticket as per usual, and stands there scratching the damn thing.  Lo and behold, asshat wins $50, and demands his cash right then and there.  So, my friend has takes the ticket, scans it, and hands him a crisp $50 from the till (accepting large bills was discretionary; it depended how much cash was in the till, etc, and someone had earlier paid with it).  Then asshat asks for his smokes and whatever else he was getting, and proffers the $50 bill.\n\n\"Sorry,\" said my friend, tapping on the sign beside the till.  \"At this time of night, we can't accept $50 and $100 bills.\"\n\nHe never did see asshat in the store again.",

I said \"yes, I know.  I'm giving you a penny so you can give me $13.60 in change.  I don't want to deal with pennies.\"\n\nThe guy gives me back my penny and gives me $13.59 in change.  He clearly didn't listen to me.  I got very annoyed, but what could I do?\n\nHere's where the petty revenge comes in.\n\nAt golden arches the receipts include an option to take a customer satisfaction survey.  Complete the survey, and you get a code allowing you to redeem the receipt for either a free medium fries and free medium soda when you buy a large sandwich, or a buy one get one free large sandwich, depending on what it says on the receipt you get.\n\nSo I take the survey, and when it gets to the part where it says 'how satisfied were you,' I say extremely dissatisfied.  And when it asks why I was extremely dissatisfied, I tell them what I just told you.\n\nI classify this as \"petty\" because, obviously, I have no idea what's going to happen to the guy as a result of my survey.\n\nIf anything.\n\nThey may come down on him hard as if he were just caught red-handed trying to steal lots and lots of hamburgers... or they may look at the reason why I was extremely dissatisfied and have a good laugh at my expense.",

        "text": "So this happened a long time ago.\n\nI lived in a shared house with a guy and another girl. We all met at college, UK college, so pre university, and rented a house together.\n\nHe smoked w33d and had a few friends that would come by every weekend and for a while we all had a lot of fun, us drinking, them smoking, watching Buffy, yes it was that long ago.\n\nThings changed after the first Christmas when everyone descended on our house for a few weeks. After, me and the other girl needed a break. Just the weekdays so we could get back to the routine.\n\nHe decided as he was a man, his friends would continue coming around and we would just have to suck it up.\n\nThings got ugly. He and I clashed A LOT. I grew up in a misogynistic household and I wasn’t taking his shit but it got really ugly. Even his friends told him he was stupid and backed off but he refused to compromise in any way.\n\nOne night, he goes out drinking with his friends. Later, I’m lying in bed when I hear them singing on their way back. Something flies through my open window and I hear his friends giving him shit for starting on me.\n\nI sit up, the windows and curtains are open and when I pick up the ‘thing’ it’s a ball of dried dirt.\n\nI left the light off and never said a word. Literally as soon as I saw that ball of dirt I knew exactly what I was going to do.\n\nWhat you need to know about him, is that he was a colossal male organ who used the fact his parents hated each other to get what he wanted out of them.\n\nHis father hated his mother so much that every Sunday he would take his grown ass adult son to the supermarket and buy him all his groceries.\n\nBecause my housemate is a lazy ass, he buys ready made salads and stuff.\n\nFor the next three months, until I moved out, I crumbled that ball of dirt into every meal he ate, garnishing them like black pepper.\n\nI never told him. But every time I saw him eat, every time he said something sexist or told me and my roommate our opinions didn’t matter and compromise was impossible, I had the satisfaction of knowing that little female dog was eating dirt.\n\nIt still makes me smile sometimes.",

Unfortunately, that meant that also every year I had the same bully and no crowd into which I could disappear. Every year, on every school playground, during every recess and gym class, at every time that any teacher/coach/lunchlady looked the other way, this kid would steal from me or physically assault me as childhood bullies tend to do.\n\nI don't think it was anything super personal. I was just the youngest/weakest kid in the class and also I wore glasses.  I guess that meant I deserved it. This went on until we moved to a different state—at which point I heard he moved on to bullying the only other boy in our grade who wore glasses. I guess wearing corrective lenses means you deserve to be bullied.\n\n**Opportunity:**\n\nFast forward, let time heal most of the bruises and fix the broken eyeglasses, then add internets until Mr. Bully's name shows up in my social media feed as someone I may know.  Quick/casual sleuthing indicated he now has a basic one-man landscaping business—which has a phone number. \n\n**Petty Revenge:**\n\nSince that fateful day on \\[social media\\], whenever I come across a marketing form and have 3 minutes to kill, I enter Mr Bully's personal info and business phone with some comments about how I'm very interested in their product/service.\n\nHe's changed his business number 3 times over the years and I like to think the marketing calls have something to do with it. Who knows, maybe someone was selling something he was buying.\n\nIn any case: Eat shit, Josh.",

One of the services we offered was an \"express\" groom. This was an add on and the dog would be worked on the moment it got there and had to be done in two hours or less. We were not allowed to put the dog in a kennel at all, so we had to let ot set on our table until pick up.\n\nSo, I had an express groom and when I got done, I called the owner. At the time it was real big to have ring back song that played instead of hearing the ring. The phone went to voice mail. I left a message saying \"Fluffy\" was ready. When the was up I called again to see if I could get an ETA on when they would get there. Once again went to voice mail. At the three-hour mark I had no choice but to put the dog in a kennel. My other appointments had come in and I was running behind.\n\nFive hours after dropping off the owner shows up mad. They were chewing me out that I never called them and how dear I put \"Fluffy\" in a kennel. They then wanted the whole groom for free. I worked commission so I was not having this. I did my part; their dog was done in the two-hour window, and I called them. The manager came up to ask what was going on and was going to zero out the groom. Before it could be done, I asked was their number right in the system. They said but I didn't call. So, I asked them did they have a ring back with this song (I had it stuck in my head all day). They looked me dead in the eye and said \"yes, how did you know?\" I just said, \"I called.\" The manager made them pay for the groom with the express groom added on.\n\nI never saw a customer gather their dog up and leave so fast. They never came back.",

        "text": "Applied for a gov job working for my county’s assessors office. Got it. Decided it would be a good job to keep as a career, so I tried my absolute best to keep up with everything. Kept my head down, was polite, tried to be nice etc.\n\nThe tasks were pretty simple for me. Draw some maps, verify some property boundaries, organize some papers. I was so bent on keeping this job, that I actually took on a side project for their office. The manager had assigned a ‘geolocation accuracy’ project that was just idiotic. The county didn’t need it for any reason, I think she just wanted to look good. She actually wanted to find the rotation of the north arrow on the 10,000+ maps, down to the second. (For those who don’t know, look up degrees, minutes, seconds. It basically 1/360th of a degree. Very precise.) The north arrows had been placed by another tech, and rotated ambiguously to whatever looked like north. The rotation of the north arrow was completely useless because it wasn’t based on any other angles or rotations,  it was just plopped down, but she wanted to know anyway, so I didn’t ask.\n\nAnyway, I looked into their files and saw that this project was going on for TEN YEARS. Exactly the amount of time she had been manager there. Nobody really did anything. The organization was bad. The data was incomplete. The process was dated. So one week, the entire office was out on vacation (my manager and two peers). I decided, you know what, I’m sick of looking for jobs. I want this job as my career. I did all of my work, and all of their work, and I completed the geolocation accuracy project nearly halfway by making an excel sheet that basically did it for you. The next two weeks I finished it completely.\n\nFor those who don’t know, the county works on a fiscal year, so everything has to be done by a single date every year. When I started work, they were 6 months behind. I put the pedal to the metal and we were able to catch up and submit everything in time.\n\nFor the next two months my manager completely ghosted me. Didn’t give me assignments. Didn’t talk to me. Didn’t answer my questions. Wouldn’t even open the door for me. I found my own work, helped my coworkers, and kept busy. Asked if I did something wrong or if I could improve somehow, and she said nope, my works good, just keep doing what I’m doing.\n\nAt the end of my six months, to the day, she hands me an evaluation sheet, FILLED WITH LIES. I was pawning my work off onto my coworkers, I was being disruptive, I was late almost every day, I was bad with customers blah blah blah. And as she hands me this paper, fires me on the spot. Right after the fiscal delivery. I confronted her big time. All she had to say was ‘doesn’t matter’ and ‘that’s all your getting’. I asked her how she could say I hadn’t done any work. If she even looked at the geolocation project or kept track of what I had been doing, she gave some obtuse answer and said doesn’t matter. I was convinced she was afraid I would take her job.\n\nWhen I started working on it, I made a backup folder filled with her original files (nearly 700 excel sheets) Cut. Copy. Select all. Delete. I was there one minute and gone the next. Have fun working on that project for the next 125 years.",

        "text": "MANY years ago... I had a friend (Mike) that met a stupidly pretty girl, in a couple months she moved in with him, they became a couple, and he paid for her collage (studying to be a vet tech).\n\nMike had a GOOD job, regular hours, as easy going a guy as you can possibly imagine. No drugs, light social drinking, didn't smoke, just no bad habits... \n\nSomething about her set me on the back foot, nothing I could put my finger on at the time, but just a little too 'Friendly'/Flirty, with her personality and looks she got away with it.\n\nNearly two years into this relationship, an electrical transformer failed at Mike's work place, was going to take 3 days to fix, so the company sent everybody home for that time. About 10:30 AM Mike took his pickup truck to the city waste disposal and got a big load of mulch for the back yard/shrub beds and went in through the alley, backed up to the house. He never saw the driveway out front...\n\nMike goes in through the garage to get tools, hears something and goes through the kitchen to the living room to find his girlfriend and her 'Friend', both in their underware, she sitting on his lap drinking his beer. She's supposed to be at school... the school he's paying for... Mike stays behind the corner and listens...\n\nShe is telling the guy what a whimp my friend Mike is, how his manhood is the size of a gummy bear, how she can't believe how stupid Mike is that he hasn't figured this out in almost a year, etc...\n\nMike goes back out, does the job at hand, takes care of the mulch, then sits in a patio chair. Eventually she notices his truck in the back yard and goes looking, he won't look at her, speak to her, won't respond at all.\n\nShe calls his brother who tells her to call an ambulance. The police arrive with EMS, the officer is a long time friend (from grade school on), my friend turns the ambulance away, and the police officer calls his closest friends, including me. Mike won't say a word to her, or when she's around, won't look in her direction. (Probably shock/anger/rejection)\n\nHe eventually talks to us... The cat is out of the bag. The officer has a plan, checks her ID for address for his 'Report', she's never changed her address to his. He owns the home, the vehicle she's driving, not on the mortgage or paying rent...\n\nSo she gets a no trespassing order, sent away under threat of arrest if she insists. She leaves. We lock up her car in the garage, remove the battery since she has keys, and change the door locks that evening. Her stuff, every scrap, gets boxed up and dumped off at her 'Platonic Friend From School' apartment.\n\nIf this were the end of it, no revenge... \n\nShe knew how to open the glass slider door. He comes home after about 3 weeks of ignoring her to find the house TRASHED. She threw something sticky on the car, threw flour on that, squirted chocolate sauce from the fridge all over the interior, utterly trashed the house with the kitchen being the worst. Couldn't prove it was her... But got a visit from police anyway. She tried to get the phone number from the married police officer friend but never admitted anything.\n\nThe revenge... I was an out patient going to the VA, in that town twice a week. The 'Platonic Friend' she moved in with kept getting wet/sticky gummy bears stuck to his doors, windows, to his floor in front of his apartment, all over his vehicle, and it kept happening. I don't know if he got evicted or got tired/spooked about it, but he moved and didn't take her along.\n\nShe moved in with some high-school friends in collage in a city about 50 miles away, she wasn't in collage anymore since the money got cut off, but they got gummy bears once a week since I had to go to the VA hospital in that city once a week.\n\nShe would up doing stripping to pay her share... gummy bears sent to her at the strip joint. The creepy, evil faced kind with fangs and crap.\n\nThe girls graduated, moved and she was on her own, got knocked up by a 'Street Artist' that fled back to where ever when she told him, she delivered twins with no idea where the guy was.\n\nThe gummy bears continued.\n\nShe got her body part way back, went back to stripping and collected welfare, but the gummy bears kept coming... People in welfare housing will do anything for a few bucks.\n\nShe met a guy from several states away, ran away with him, got knocked up again, the guy dissapeared again, triplets this time.\n\nAt least the gummy bears stopped.\n\nSo skip forward about 25 years, the kids aged out of the welfare system, she moved back to the area and IN WITH HER MOM...\n\nThe gummy bears started again... \n\nThat friend died of cancer just over a year ago, she had the gall to show up at the funeral home! Met a wall of meat (his friends) that told her exactly where to go. He had a good woman that stuck with him through thick &amp; thin, and the two didn't meet...\n\nAfter she showed up at the funeral, someone (poorly) stenciled gummy bears on the 20 year old piece of junk she was driving with spray paint, all the way down the side and across the back. The bears were pornographic, not cute and cuddly.\n\nRecently she got a 10 pound size see through gummy bear with a dildo inside. The dildo says \"Platonic Friend\" down the side. The gummy bear is made of virtually indestructible resin. You can find the molds on line...\n\nYes Dorothy, revenge CAN come past the grave.\n\nMike's friends are semi-retired or retired, and we have a lot of time on our hands...",

Never in my entire life I held back something I wanted to say, i dont keep my toughts to myself and I never cared that this would bring me some enemies, but when you break me I turn cold an transform in to this little evil mastermind elf and I could hurt u and make everybody belive it was just a little accident, not proud of it, but happened a few times\n\nI started calling out her BS, and people started noticing that she was provoking me, this cut her enthusiasm by half, but i wasn't done with my little vendetta. Our van had this thing above people heads to put our backpacks during the ride, i waited patiently util she sat next to the dor to open it to other students, my house was before hers, so when was my time to get down i grabbed my full of books and projects heavy backpack and gave it a pull, it fell freely, right on top of her, and I flew by the door, pretending I didn't notice \n\nShe never messed with me again. About a year latter the van driver told me she accused me of hitting her to her father, she came crying tho him that same day of the \"accident\", and he requested a meeting with the van staff to talk about this, but they've never told me about this, since i was so nice to everybody and never even talked back at her, they told her dad about her bullying me, not the other way around, she got grounded on top of everything. I played dumb the entire time she was telling me about this \"omg, I didn't know a boy all of this\" I could be an actress for that performance.\n\nAs for the boy he spread rumors about me for the hole school when I told him I liked him, that for sure ruined my social life in my final years of school, when I Graduated and meet one of my teachers in a party years latter she told me that he was actually gay, so yeah, not really god people around the school",

        "text": "I randomly remembered this event today and thought it would fit well here.\n\nWhen I was around ten, my mom was in a local mom's group, and they would meet up at the park during the summer to talk while all of us kids played. It was a relatively large group, and like all large groups of children around various ages, there were a few bullies. I had a bully, I was a super annoying dorky kid who had way too much confidence for my own good, so I probably did something to annoy this older boy around twelve another to pick on me. At first, he would just poke at how I was short in passing, which didn't bother me that much. Then, it changed to calling me fat and short. I minded the fat part a little more, but my friends advised me just to ignore the boy, especially because he was much bigger than us and had a group of friends who were also mean, so for a while, I just shook off the jabs.\n\nThen, it happened. The boy did something ten-year-old me considered unforgivable. One day, we were all playing Red Rover. \"Red rover, red rover, let OP come over!\" the children on the opposite side called, yet, when my name was called out, another name was shouted louder by my bully, \"PIGGY, COME OVER!\" I felt the flush of embarrassment and anger in my cheeks as I jogged over to the other side, but I tried to hold my head up, that was until I heard and boy and his friends oinking like pigs in my direction. I felt tears threaten to brim in my eyes and anger kindle in my heart, and right then and there as the rest of the kids were yelling \"red rover\", I came up with my plan. I knew there was no point confronting the boy, it would only make things worse, but I glanced over to a few yards away where his mom was chatting with some of the other moms. \n\nMy bully's mom was a kind lady, but she was very strict with her children, according to my mom, who was friends with her, and I knew her son would never act up in front of her and live to tell the tale. His mom was also very short and plump. \n\nFor a few weeks, I waited and watched, and finally, my chance came. We were at the pool for the birthday party of one of the kids, and I looked up to see my bully's mom head toward the bathroom. I followed her and waited by the sinks. I stared down at my hands and thought of my favorite cat dying until I felt tears begin to roll down my cheeks. A stall door swung open, and I heard footsteps and the sound of water running, but I kept my head down. \n\n\"Hey, are you ok, dear?\" \n\nI looked up at my bully's mom and sniffed, \"No, this boy keeps calling me fat and short, and he makes pig noises when I walk by him.\" \n\nThe bully's mom was sympathetic, telling me that it was very mean of anyone to behave that way and that she used to get bullied too. Then, the moment I was hoping for came. \"Who is the boy that is bullying you?\" she asked. I said I would show her, and the amount of satisfaction I felt when I pointed to her son was enormous. Her face fell, and then her expression darkened, \"I will take care of this, don't worry.\"\n\nShe walked away from me back to the pavilion the moms were sitting under, and then I heard her call out his name.  I did not get to hear what she said to him, but my friend who was reapplying sunscreen told me it was a long scolding about how she had heard he was bullying kids and how she had thought she taught him better, then, how disappointed she was that he would fat-shame anyone when he knows some people have no control. My bully sat out the rest of our time there and did not come to the next play date. He never bothered me again. ",

        "text": "Tldr; nephew stole $300 from my mom by charging her card for fortnite purchases while borrowing my switch. She won't make him pay it back. So for the next 3-6 years, his birthday and Christmas roll around, i send $25-50 to her bank account, and don't give him anything. \n\nAs Christmas time rolls around, I still feel petty towards my nephew. My mom lived with me for a few years while getting back on her feet. She doesn't have much money, but she would always help out her kids if they needed it - even if she really shouldn't. \n\nOne of my nephews, ~10 years old at the time, asked to borrow my Nintendo switch so he could play Fortnite. I said yes because I never played it. After a bit, he asked my mom (his grandma) for $10 for the battle pass. She said yes and stupidly put her credit card in his account for it. Some point in the future, another $10 or so was charged to it. 'on accident' according to the nephew. Oh well, not a big deal. She let it go. \n\nMaybe it's lack of experience but I find the whole account thing between Nintendo switch, epic games, and Fortnite to be confusing. I tried over and over to delete her card info out of the accounts, but he would always get it back somehow. I don't think he could have written her info down. My brother had to drive 45 minutes to get the switch to me to delete the info. \n\nOver the next year or two, he charged something like $300 to the credit card outside of the times she gave him permission..somehow it was always a mistake, and he would immediately text and apologize and got to where he asked us not to tell his parents. My mom wouldn't do anything about it other than tell him to stop. I tried to stay out of it because it was between them. \n\nSo, I got fed up after a certain point. Texted brother to bring me my switch back and I was keeping it. Told him about all of the charges. My brother has always used my mom for money; including stealing from her. So he acted concerned but really, he couldn't/wouldn't pay her back. He brought it back to me. Nephew kept asking to have it back and was apologizing but the answer was no. \n\nThat wasn't enough for me. Mom wasn't going to force them to pay back the money, but i couldn't keep myself out of it any longer. I decided the nephew wouldnt be getting the $25-50 gifts he normally gets for Christmas and birthdays. He could pay back his debt over the next 3-6 years, and I'd make sure she got it since we have some linked bank accounts. \n\nIt's been 2 years now without any gifts from me. He may not even notice. But I do, and I feel good about it. She still buys him gifts of course. But she's being repaid one way or another.",

        "text": "Told this story to one of my friends and she suggested putting it here! Not sure if it qualifies but I'll give it a shot. Obligatory LTR/FTP, on mobile. \n\nBack in 2009 I worked in a cinema in Wales, and one of the perks was getting free tickets, which I used *a lot* as a specky 19yo film nerd. I'd been waiting for a good horror movie, and I thought \"Orphan\" might be it. Got there early, picked my seat, and settled down. Just as the adverts start up, a group of (maybe?) ten 15yo's flood into the cinema. They decide that the row in front of me is where they want to go, and wheedle and plead for everyone to move up so that they can sit together in one row. Obviously, people say no, so after some foot-stomping and whining, they decide to sit five(?) in the row, and five(?) in another row. They're snorting and cackling and chucking popcorn and putting their feet up on seats and playfully nudging eachother throughout the adverts, and then the trailers. Movie finally starts, and they don't quieten down. \n\nI head out to the ushers (my mates) and let them know what's occuring. They come in, tell them to behave, but there's not much else that can be done for minor disturbances. The teen monstrosities shut up for about 0.04seconds, and then resume. Ten minutes in, someone else goes to complain. They get told to STFU, politely, and they don't listen again. By now, three of the group (all girls) have begun a running commentary of everything that's happening in the movie. People shout for them to be quiet, they don't listen.\n\nA little while in (maybe halfway - minor spoilers) the lead actress breaks her own arm in a vice, and one of the girls let's out the most EAR-SPLITTING SCREECH, and I finally lose my patience.\n\nGirl: OMG DID YOU SEE THAT?!?\nMe: WE ALL DID YOU STUPID (bleep)! ITS THE FUCKING CINEMA!!\n\nThe place erupts in laughter, and the girl stands up and starts yelling at me, but I have no idea what she said because I'm very rarely that witty, and I was creased with laughter. And then the Usher walks back in. The other two girls start weeping on-cue about how I'm abusing them, and the Usher (after being told that's not what happened) decides to side with me, and finally gets the manager and throws them out. When I left after the end of the movie, they were at the ticket office with one of their parents who was berating the staff for a refund that was not forthcoming, and blaming me for their behaviour.  I still smile when I think about it.",

I go into my sisters room to see if I need to get any trash and saw she's kept her tv, dvd player, totes and misc items.

In my country it's for both boys and girls.\n\n I (f11) was in a group of 5-6 kids, and so was this boy (m12) who was from my school, he was in the grade over mine. We both liked chess and to read and even shared the same last name. \n\nSo when he asked to borrow a series of pocketbooks that my older brother gave me  I said yes. But then, all of a sudden he changed, and got really hateful. He didn't want to return my books, he called me bad names, and was a real jerk about it.\n\nA few weeks went by, and when I realized he really wasn't going to return the books I told my older brother, and he called the guy, threatened to tell his parents, and then he finally returned the books.\n\nBut that wasn't the end of it. The bullying got so bad, that I decided to drop out of the scouts. But I had been a scout long before him, since I was 6 years old, and 2 of my scout-leaders turned up at my house, to talk to my parents about it. They promised to change the groups, so I wouldn't have to be around that boy anymore. I guess it worked, because I was a scout until I was around 14.\n\nA few years went by, and I moved out, and got a room in the nearest bigger city. One morning, around 3 or 4am, on my way home from clubbing, I met the guy again. \n\nHe was happy to see me, because he had been out drinking with some friends, and had somehow gotten lost, and everything was closed by now. The next bus to the village wasn't scheduled before 9am. \n\nHe asked if he could crash at my place. I just said: \"tough luck bro, you're on your own\", and then I went home alone. How he spent the next 4/5 hours before he could get on the bus, I don't know, but I'm glad I got my petty revenge.",

All in good fun, and he was in much less shape than I was at the time so I usually could outrun him no problem. He estimates he shot around 50,000 of these little plastic balls over the course of a few years. \n\nFast forward to now, and we both regularly are at our parents’ house where we work at the family business in the backyard. \n\nEvery time it rains or the area gets mowed, some of these red pellets pop up from their graves. I have been finding them and collecting them for years. Sometimes I leave them on his workbench for him to discover when I’m not around. Sometimes I hand them to him directly. Sometimes I put them in his car on the driver’s seat. I’ve even roped in some of our coworkers on the joke and now they return any pellets they find to him. \n\nBro just rolls his eyes and tosses them into the trash while I smile sweetly and remind him that I won’t shoot him point-blank in the forehead while he’s napping on the couch, like he did to me when we were in high school.",

Savage comes in tiers, with 4 fights per tier.\n\nI met my ex through Final Fantasy XIV. Our relationship lasted 7 months before I realised that I deserved better than a boyfriend who, in his own words, \"thought it was okay to put raiding above \\[me\\].\" ^(he was terrible in other ways too but that's irrelevant to the petty revenge)\n\nShortly after I dumped him, a new savage tier was released. This would be my first ever savage tier and my ex's third, but despite my inexperience, I cleared the tier months before he did. Very soon after I posted about clearing the second fight, my ex DM'd me whining about how slow his progress was.\n\nNow, my ex used to make 'harmless' comments about things that I had been vocally self-concious about. One of these comments was telling me that my performance in a normal raid was nice and all, but I would be absolutely terrible in savage. He clearly got something out of undermining me and I suspected he was now unhappy that I was no longer 'inferior'.\n\nWhat's a petty man to do but escalate?\n\nCurrently, there are four ultimates in FFXIV. After clearing the aforementioned savage tier, I went and cleared three ultimates. The thing about ultimates is that it isn't 100% only about the experience or the bragging rights - you also get tokens to buy kickass glowy weapons. My ex once said that [one of the ultimate weapons](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Ultimate_Ukonvasara) was the best axe in the game and he really wanted it. My first token was spent on what I actually wanted, but take a guess what I bought with my second token.\n\nPredictably, my ex whined about wanting to do ultimates - but alas, he Simply Cannot! To be clear, he is a NEET who made the concious decision to prioritize raiding over his boyfriend. I have no idea what's stopping him from doing ultimates, other than him being allergic to anything that requires real effort.\n\nI offered to teach him, but he kept making excuses to turn me down, so screw him. I'm going to go work on that fourth ultimate.\n\n**TL;DR -** Ex wanted shiny weapon from difficult raid. I now have shiny weapon and he has nothing.",

        "text": "I’ve endured a lot of very bad, normalized behavior where I work over the last year. However, the general manager of our store repeatedly speaks to me and other staff in a way that is not okay in 2022. For example, she’s said two anti-gay and/or homophobic slurs over the time I’ve been there that were witnessed and I’m not having any of that. when she continued to speak to me in a way that insinuated she didn’t think I was intelligent, I reported her and made it the highest escalation possible to corporate and she’s probably getting let go in the new year per her review. fuck right off, Karen!",

        "text": "When I was in school, I was bullied consistently for a variety of things. The sound of my voice, the people I hung out with etc. Some of them made a social media page about me calling me a variety of slurs with pictures of me they took. \n\nOne of the smaller things that happened was once they started asking me for Gum in class whenever they saw me with it, and me being the dope I was handed some over.\n\nFast forward the insults and bullying is still going on, teachers aware at this point somethings up but not knowing what exactly, and they are still taking gum from me. From going into my bag when I wasnt looking, to trying to take some out of my pocket.\n\nOne day, I had the brainwave to go to the school urinals and take the pieces of gum out of the packet and wipe them all in the boys urinals and really made sure they got a good go in them, then repackage them as best I could to make it look unopened. \n\nThen went to class waited for them to take my gum and I just handed it over. I felt so good watching them eat that gum that day. Bullying stopped soon after.",

        "text": "This one is from a long time back when I was a freshman in college.  \n\nFirst semester freshman year studying Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Given all freshman Eng students take the same core courses (Math, Chem, Physics, etc.), we started forming a study group in our dorm.  Asked one kid if he wanted to join and he turned us down with attitude…. Basically, he was a valeDICtorian from some small rural town in Southern Illinois and proud of that fact.  The rest of us all weren’t but we had all graduated from very competitive college prep schools.  \n\nRoll forward to the 2nd semester and the lowest GPA in the study group was a 4.0 out of 5.0.  The valeDICtorian was on probation because due to his grades.  Early 2nd semester, he approached us to join the group.  By this point, we had all arranged to be in the same class so we would have the same teacher and he was in none of our classes.  Quite a number of us were also still upset about his attitude so we told him that he was too smart for us and he should find other valeDICtorians to study with.  He ended up dropping out of school midway through the 2nd semester due to his grades and going to a small community college near his home town.",

        "text": "Buckle up bitches, this is one of my favourite quitting stories.  No I did not flip a table, no I did not tell my boss to stick it; but instead, I beat them at their own illegal game.\n\nMy work doesn’t pay overtime or holiday pay (which is highly illegal where I am).  When I finally quit, among many many other reasons (most of which was a huge lack of respect despite bending over backwards for the company).\n\nWhen I finally decided to quit, I was planning on writing a formal letter, signing it and all but of course, I got a last minute custom cake order &amp; only got the reference photo ONE AND A HALF HOURS BEFORE PICK UP (this is like every fucking cake I do, such a garbage system).  I fucking had it &amp; sent a text to both my manager (who I actually like) &amp; my GM (general manager) - a 23 year old know it all who doesn’t actually know shit. \n\nNo reply ALL DAY (the audacity).  Until finally around 2pm, GM came downstairs &amp; brought me into the office.  He asked me why I was quitting so I told him everything, every time of disrespect, every awful aspect of their trash order system, every rude &amp; unnecessary comment from the owner.  The expectations that the employees are to be essentially broken down into submission as if it’s nazi Germany (yes I said this word for word). \n\nAmong my many complaints (&amp; very valid ones), I said it’s BS we don’t get holiday pay as it’s fucking illegal not to be paid holiday pay.  GM asked me if I knew how to calculate holiday pay &amp; while I do in my home province, I don’t actually remember how to do it for this province (regardless, it’s fucking grade 5 level math).  \n\nHe tells me (in the most condescending tone): “See?  You don’t know how to do it and that’s fine, I didn’t know how to it either before &amp; now I know that it’s a complicated process” \n\nAfter adding that it’s really not complicated at all he says again that it’s “too difficult to do”\n\nThen, he tried to push me out before my last day until I brought up severance pay &amp; all of a sudden “they might actually need my help for the last week”\n\nWELL he picked the wrong math whiz to say this to.  \n\nI couldn’t sleep that night, at all.  It bothered me so much that he said this to me when in fact, accounting was my second choice for career studies (I truly have a gift for math but I can’t sit still so I chose baking instead). \n\nI went through ALL my pay stubs &amp; my hours &amp; calculated the exact amount owed for each holiday that I was employed there - I even got a pay raise half way through one holiday pay period so I went as far as to calculate what percentage should be at the original pay and what percentage of that pay should be with my pay raise - down to a .00%. \n\nI also added all the calculations for my overtime pay as I (and I made sure to write this as well) did not sign any agreement being okay with not being paid overtime IE ILLEGAL. \n\nSo high as fuck &amp; half drunk, at 10pm, I managed to do all the math that was “too difficult to do” (for the crap ass excuse for accountants they have).\n\nI sent it all (math &amp; everything) by email &amp; said “I took the initiative to calculate the missing holiday pay, since its, as you said, too difficult to do.  \nI’ve included overtime pay as I did not sign any agreement stating I would be okay with no receiving it - texting this to you as I prefer to have things in writing\n\nHave a good evening!”\n\nGM basically ghosted me for 2 days.  My manager said that he got the email, he asked if he was going to pay me &amp; GM said “well I have to, legally I’m obligated”\n\nBUT that wasn’t enough for me, I just had to ask him myself; so when I saw him that day this was our convo:\n\nMe: ‘I assume you got my email?’ \n\nGM: ‘yea I did’ \n\n…. \n\nMe: “and?”\n\nGM: “and what?” \n\nMe: “well are you going to pay it?” \n\nGM (in a bitchy attitude): “yea obviously” \n\nHahahahahaha mother fucker I WIN!!\n\nI know my labour laws asshole.  Don’t fuck with me.\n\n\nTLDR; general manager told me that holiday pay is “too difficult” to calculate so they don’t pay overtime or holiday pay (which is illegal).  So I took the initiative to do all the calculations myself &amp; now he said he’s legally obligated to pay me.  I know my labour laws asshole.",

        "text": "My brother is a few years older than me, and even though we're now in our 30s, we still bicker occasionally. Nothing serious, and usually over really trivial stuff. I also have a younger sister who finds it hilarious when we argue, so she sometimes winds us up to keep it going.\n\nOne evening last year we had planned to meet after work and go Christmas present shopping for our family. He said he was sorry, he'd forgotten, and was having a beer with his friends. Meh, no bother. I told him he was a lazy so-and-so, forgot about it, and decided to go shopping another time. \n\nMy sister was visiting me that weekend and so I asked if she wanted to go shopping. She agreed, and when we met, asked if I'd gotten much done with our brother a few days before. I told her he'd cancelled and she said \"oh, that's so rude, I can't believe you're not that bothered! By the way, did you hear that our nephew is really getting into Lego?\"\n\nOur nephew (brother's son) had just turned 5 at this point and had been given a little lego set to play with. I didn't know he loved it so much. So, thanks to my younger sister's encouragement, my Christmas present shopping included a large Lego brick box for my nephew. 790 pieces of Lego to play with. Neatly wrapped and sweetly signed off from Aunty Sophie.\n\nMy brother spent Christmas that year at home with his wife and son, and his family-in-law. My nephew called a a few days later to say thank you, and my dad wants to talk to you. My brother said his son loved the Lego, but he really didn't. In his words, \"there's fucking Lego everywhere\". \n\nI told him that I had planned to buy it for his son that weekend that he cancelled on me \\[obviously I hadn't!\\], and he sighed and said \"I should have come with you and stopped you. He keeps putting it in my pockets.\" I'm glad it wasn't a video call because I had a huge grin on my face for the rest of the conversation.\n\nA few weeks later my sister and I had gone to stay with our brother for the weekend. One evening he took us out for a drink, and when he went to pay, he pulled his wallet out. Two small lego bricks fell out of his pocket at the same time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: brother cancels Christmas shopping plans, I buy his son the biggest box of Lego I could find. It ends up everywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: my brother messaged me earlier today saying \"please no Lego this year\" which reminded me to post this here. This year's present is a little rocket league RC car, which my brother's happy with. Also, I should point out his wife was okay with it, as it was my brother who'd bought the first Lego set anyway.",
