        "text": "So in DNA replication theres the template and the coding strand. And I understand how they are complimentary to each other. And to transcribe (and eventually translate) a particular gene from a coding strand mRNA is synthesized from the template strand. Insofar as the Coding strand and the newly synthesized mRNA strand are complimentary to the same thing its fair to say they are essentially equal (apart from T--&gt;U). That all makes sense but I was wondering if there is just one coding strand and one template strand. As if the coding strand of DNA actually has all the genes and the template strand is just a bunch of meaningless complimentary gobbledygook that allows for identical mRNA to be transcribed or if each strand takes turns getting to be the coding and template? So the base pairs that make up a particular gene serve the purpose of coding for a gene when that strand gets to be the coding strand or just being the stencil for RNA when the other strand gets to be the coding strand.

        "text": " Prions are famous for the past BSE epidemic, which was linked to the deadly human vCJD (mad cow disease), and that was probably caused by the  practice of feeding cows with cows meat. Besides the poor management of the cuts more prone to infection and pathogenic feeding (practices that  are now strictly regulated), it was speculated that infectious prions could spread from infected manure to the environment, via sludge and  waters, and then contaminating crops and plantations and thus the final consumer, even if vegetarian.  \nAt the same time it has been questioned if  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, which pathogenesis follow prion-like mechanisms, could be actually caused by the spread of prions in the environment, through food consumption. I then wonder if:\n- Could pathogenic prions be always the result of cannibalism, like we have seen in cows and in the fore tribe (kure disease)? This could be the nature way to preserve species from cannibalism. Simply it makes cannibals die and  also make them infectious.\n- Could feeding poultry or other animals with food derived from the same animal (animal cannibalism), generate infectious prions? Is this practice banned as it is with cows?\n- What is the chance that infectious prions are more spread than we think and are actually causing the high rates of common neurodegenerative diseases we see in our countries?\n- Are some vegetables, fruit and meats (besides beef) more risky than others? How can we do prevention?   \n ",

The Wiki article I linked to says the principle works because physics is the same everywhere in the universe. That isn't just for space, it's for space*time* -- physics has been the same throughout time. So why is the universe homogenous across space, but inhomogeneous across time?

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/8v1918/despite_the_rigorous_principles_that_science/",
        "text": "First of all, I want to point this out very thoroughly - the idea of science and its principles of following the practices of rationality, critical thinking and verifiable and calculable evidence is **VERY** deeply in ingrained in the scientific community. \n\nThere is a large reason why some methods and practices in the scientific community is deeply embedded when scientists make scientific enquiries and experiments - peer-reviewed articles, countless upon countless of trail-and-error experimentation, repeated experiments to provide the same results, standardized tests and research methods to provide the most optimal results, the principle of falsifiability and countless others to help make sure that science is often more and more refined every day and help seperate between hypotheses that can be nullified and rejected vs the hypotheses and theories that can be learned explored further.\n\n(because of even sciences can possibly be done incorrectly or certain hypotheses or results do not turn out as expected)\n\nThat being said, science has followed these principles for a very long time in order to make sure to continue making good science and eliminate the possibility of bad sciences (and what you define as \"good science\" and \"bad science\" is also up for debate because there is also a never-ending argument on what makes a good science and what makes a pseudo-science)\n\nAnd that being said, despite all these principles, science are done by scientists and even scientists are prone to error or sometimes even their own interpretations of reality (which in philosophy, there is a whole branch of philosophical inquiry regarding the study of knowledge known as \"epistemology\") and every scientific branch follows a certain sub-set of values and principles as well.\n\nFor example, coming from a psychological background, many psychological schools of thought follow their own certain shared views even though they clearly follow shared scientific knowledge about psychology like the unconscious, self-efficacy theory, classic experiments like the Ash Line experiment, the Stanford Prison experiment and so on.\n\nBut you can easily notice the differences between psychoanalysts and Gestalt psychologists, for example as one focuses mostly on the unconscious and the past, while other, while still focusing on the unconscious to some degree, focuses more on the here-and-now, responsibility of one's actions and self-awareness.\n\nGiven that humans are social species, they often follow shared social values and norms within their own social groups, even where science is involved because the values of what scientists follows are also created by humans as well.\n\n(that is of course, even scientific communities are open to criticism and interpretation because nothing is purely 100% correct)\n\nI often think of this as well when it comes to other scientific disciplines which were later deemed as pseudosciences like for example, scientific racism strictly followed shared social norms that there must be something to prove that some humans races are superior and some are inferior and can be proven by hard scientific facts like via genetic factors or how certain races think and perceive others. (which was of course deemed as a pseudo-science and was possibly prone to bias or internalised ideas regarding racism)\n\nEven what we define as \"fact\" is also something that is open to criticism because while we can provide physical facts of the existence of something like there are fossils that prove that evolution does indeed exist and has existed slowly for millions of years and showed the slow progression and adaption of different species and their slow distinctions from their ancestors, some what we define as \"facts\" can be open to interpretation.\n\nFor example, statistical numbers are very influential and are used in commercials, political or business arguments, and so on and there is a reason why there are statistical equations that are done very carefully and thoroughly to provide the most accurate results\n\nBut if you look deeper in the numbers, even statistics can be a bit tricky to interpret and may even fool you into believing that one thing is one way but in reality, it may not be that straight-forward.\n\nEven \"facts\" that are proven later are also prone to interpretation like Einstein's theory of relativity was regarded as good and very thoroughly explained science but we were only able to provide physical evidence that prove the theory of relativity much later when technology managed to advance just a little bit more.\n\n(this also comes to mind when we think about phrenology that tried to claim that certain parts of the brain were associated with some form of cognitive function except the execution behind them was incorrect such as it was thought that different brain sizes were related to differences in intelligence or other cognitive functions. However, the mentality behind it was not wrong as it was possible to provide more refined evidence about how the brain works and what parts of the brain are more associated with what cognitive function via the use of more advanced technology like EEG, fMRI, and PET)\n\nSo there is a certain philosophy regarding the logic behind scientific thought and even different forms of sciences have their own methods of how their sciences can be proven thoroughly and rigourously (like social sciences such as anthropology, sociology, and political science focus more on the interactions and social dynamics among societies, while mathematics focuses more on numbers and arithmetic patterns, or paleontology focuses more on examining on artifacts that were left behind for millions of years)\n\nWhen the philosophy of what makes a good science or not is still up for debate because like in my last post inquiring on what is a good science and what is a pseudo-science, I often got different answers meaning that not everyone thinks the exact same way when it comes to defining \"good science\"",

These downed trees can be used for building, but not fuel.  I am proposing we cut more trees than we can use, however, so they will eventually need to be stored in compact piles similar to what you would see in the yard of a lumber mill. These cut trees remain a carbon sink, while new growth removes CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\nI propose that within a hundred years, we can replace twice over the amount of carbon stored in the world's wood, effectively creating 3 times the amount of wood currently on the planet.

Posting here in case I can't get it back up)\n\nFrom what I understand, our earliest ancestral organism thought to have what we would consider a brain (interactions of interneurons which make \"decisions\") is a type of Planarian, or flatworm. Since the lowest threshold in size for Planarian we classify as having a brain is roughly [0.7mm and contains about 8,000 neurons](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Planaria_nervous_system), I'm guessing that's similar to the neurological structure of the earliest ones. It is difficult to put a date on when these guys first developed, but I think the estimates are about 500-550 million years ago. Now take a human who has about [86 billion (elephants have even more at 251 billion!)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_by_number_of_neurons#/media/File:Brain_size_comparison_-_Brain_neurons_(billions).png), does this mean that our neurological systems developed through evolution at an average rate of 150 neurons each year? And for what would become elephants, an average rate of 450 neurons per year? Did the brain evolve much more rapidly in the earlier stages with mutations resulting in large tumor-like clumps of extra neurons which could mesh more easily, and with fewer lethal outcomes, with the less complex neurological systems of our ancestors?",

One possible solution: build a big transmitter, have it travel to some place that makes it difficult to determine which star it hails from, and *then* make some noise. (Obviously, we're talking about a process that would take centuries to thousands of years.) Question is: [given our local neighborhood](http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/12lys.html), where would be the ideal place to station the transmitter in order to obfuscate its point of origin?

And, does that increased efficiency apply to *most* things one could say in that language, due to some underlying efficiency in the syntax or grammer or something like that? \n\nThink of it like computer code. One could create a program that does a thing using lots of coding information or very little. The difference is efficiency. Does this apply to languages? And is one single language probably more efficient than all the others? And to create a measurable variable, I guess that would be the time it takes to say something, on average.

Assuming this doesn't have any \"special properties to keep itself hidden from any possible method of detection\". Would it be something that we would detect eventually / know already? Or by accident? A needle in a haystack? A tick on a tip of a needle in a haystack dump of football field size?\n\nI know that \"depends what it's made of\" is also crucial - it is something obviously different from it's surroundings. I wanted to avoid details but I was thinking (fictionally) about a giant monster(s) of sort, buried extremely deep. I know that at this depth there are huge pressures and temperatures - the biology and composition of said monsters probably would need to be entirely fictitous - not to say that living being of this size is highly unprobable (due to square-cube law), let alone be able to resurface itself by digging - But I want to check what **other** elements I can make probable and which I have to fill with fiction.  So something about it's composition would be unusual, probably extremely high density, generating a lot of heat while active but maybe closer to the ~~underground~~ **surrounding** temperature when dormant. I said ~~100 m\\^3~~ 1 hm\\^3 cube earlier - because I assume it will be in an embryonic position - so probably looking for something of a sphere shape actually.\n\n**Using currently known methods, technology and no fiction ideas (or at least plausible extrapolation)** \\- What if such object would be buried at 30-40km underground? Would we know about it by know? (hey, something's there doc!) Do we have technology that would detect it or is there \"we have technology but that would be to expensive\"? What sort of information we would be able to get about it? How strange would it sound if someone - upon discovery - would say that \"this is some sort of a unique ore that we haven't seen yet, haven't found anywhere near the surface nor as a trace post eruption samples\"? (of course mistaking the creature for an ore - because of it's dormant nature)\n\nHow it would change if we assume there is more than one across all Earth? Few? Hundreds? Thousands?  \n\n\nEDIT: Of course 1 hm\\^3 (1 000 000 m\\^3) not 100 m\\^3 as I wrote earlier... so stupid of me.. sorry",

        "text": "I ma interested in wild animal suffering. But all the resources I can find start with assumptions like these:  \n\n1. The \"appearances\" assumption: it LOOKS like suffering so it is. Example: this morning a buzzard killed a small bird outside our window. It shrieked for over a minute.\n\n2. The \"stress hormones in laboratories\" assumption: we cannot measure a mind, so we will measure the hormone instead. Example: put an animal in a lab, do something, take a blood sample.\n\n3. The \"chemical pathways\" assumption: \"Animal X does not have a central nervous system like ours, therefore cannot suffer.\"\n\n4. The \"cannot think ahead\" assumption. \"Animal X cannot think ahead so does not worry about stuff that would terrify us.\"\n\nThese strike me as very naive. I hope that a serious thinker would go beyond these and say something more useful. Here are some counter arguments:\n\n1. On appearances: There are many examples where suffering is not there when we expect it. E.g. the zebra who goes into shock when eaten; the soldier who is a heroin addict in the field yet does not feel withdrawal when he gets home and goes cold turkey. In the case of the buzzard kill, the shrieking could simply be to warn others and not a measure of pain. There are also pelnty of exampels where a human who \"has it all\" nevertheless kills themself because their mental suffering is so bad. And examples of parasite invested hunter gatherers foraging for nasty food in a drought yet they seem extremely content with life.\n\n2. On labs: Labs are not real life. E.g. the rat experiment that seemed to show one thing (addiction, aggression, etc), but when the rats were given a much happier environment the same experiment had very different results.\n\n3. On pathways: here is a thought experiment. An alien is to us as we are to the amoeba. It refuses to accept that we feel pain, because humans lack the alien's higher pathways. Regarding our neurons, the alien can trace them and predict our actions before we do them, so it concludes we are just mindless \"stimulus - response\" automatons. So humans do not feel pain in any way that matters?\n\n4. On thinking ahead: the alien argument again applies. Humans \"thinking ahead\" can be seen as extremely primitive, especially in the moment of pain. This overlaps with debates on self deception: are we really as informed as we think we are?\n\nSo I'm looking for resources from researchers who account for these things. E.g. perhaps they come from a logical basis: \"entities must avoid damage therefore pain is felt\"? Or \"pain only has evolutionary value if we can avoid it, otherwise it is a distraction that harms our decision making, therefore most animal pain is unconscious.\" \n\nCan anyone help? Where are the best thinkers on pain (preferably accessible to the lay person)?",
