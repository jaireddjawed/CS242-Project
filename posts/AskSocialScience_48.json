        "text": "(Typo in title: Are there other social benefits *to* good public transport?)\n\nI'm an American who has spent over a year in Europe.\n\nI've traveled all over Southern and Western Europe, using google maps to take buses, trams and metros in small cities like Reykjavik, Iceland to large cities like Paris, France. I took trains from one side of Italy to the other.\n\nI was continuously astounded at the amazing public transportation everywhere I went.\n\nThe metros in even poor and overcrowded places like Athens, Greece are even better than most American cities, except for NYC and Chicago. Even the bus systems of Tirana, Albania are better than my current city Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nI've been back in America for a couple months now and driving has me scared shitless. While I had been impressed by the efficiency of European public transportation while there, now I'm impressed by the safety.\n\nI'm curious about the statistics but I'm not sure how to make so general comparisons between America and Europe.\n\nAre there any studies, metrics, or calculations that show public transportation leads less deaths and injuries? What can you tell me about them? How many lives does having a good public transportation system save? Or are deaths by buses, trams and metros actually higher than I imagine?\n\nAny sort of comparisons between America and Europe would be appreciated too, I don't care where exactly. What are the auto accident deaths per population for each country?\n\n***\n\nTangential question: how does good public transportation effect the mental and social health of a population?\n\nPardon my ramblings but does this make any sense or is there any data related to this?\n\nBased on my experience, having good public transportation like in Europe does much more than provide efficient means of travel. It both reflects and provides a more social, communal lifestyle, which is healthier for humans as we are social animals. It's publicly funded, so everyone's contributing and feels like they are providing for their neighbors. Being on a bus or metro is physically more communal since you're literally with other people of your town or city too. I never once felt like I needed a car in Europe. Plus, European cities are very walkable, which makes everything feel closer too.\n\nIn contrast, American transportation is heavily individualized, and reflects American individualism and alienation. Having your own car is not only effectively required but valued, and is something everyone strives for if not already has. American cities and towns are so spread out its impossible to walk to your destination except for NYC. One must rely on a car. Using your own self to provide a means of transportation is a huge cost for each person too, and with every dollar out into a vehicle it seems like it's much more of an emotional investment too. In no other country have I met people so attached to their cars, it's really quite telling how connected Americans get with there cars when some of us even *name* our cars. But it's no surprise since humans are social animals that spending countless hours alone in a car might trigger some response to socialize the car. Meanwhile, those in America that do rely on public transportation are stereotyped as poor, so there's classist social stigma against its use too.\n\nI hope that wasn't too pseudoscientific but it was for my question :)\n\nThank you very much!\n\nMerci beaucoup, dank je, takk fyrir, efkaresto, gracias, shukran, toda :)",

An observer reacts, goading Luke on in the fight occurring between the two. Black males reacting to insults about their mothers seems to be a trope in American popular culture. This is perhaps the first time I've seen it used in a context that wasn't in some way blatantly stereotyping of or condescending to African Americans. As the TV series Luke Cage is well-regarded as being respectful towards 21st Century African American culture and values, it made me curious as to where this apparent sensitivity came from and why African Americans, especially males, are particularly concerned about protecting the virtue of their mothers.\n\n**EDIT**: Relevant scene: https://youtu.be/IGWxW4-0h-o?t=1m9s",

It ranks third in the proportion of residents who go hungry each year, and dead last in overall health. A quarter of the state's students drop out from high school or don't graduate on time. Partly as a result, Louisiana leads the nation in its proportion of \"disconnected youth\"—20 percent of 16- to 24-year-olds in 2013 were neither in school nor at work. (Nationally, the figure is 14 percent.) Only 6 percent of Louisiana workers are members of labor unions, about half the rate nationwide.\n\nThis story seems to be more charitable to the plight of Louisianans and others in the deep south than most, but it's still someone from outside writing to an audience of outsiders about the suffering locals.  What do Louisianans themselves think?  Or people from Georgia, or Mississippi?  \n\nKind of hoping for academic voices speaking directly to what they think the problems are, but academic summaries of popular opinion would probably also be interesting.",

I could see myself pursuing either and it's been an ordeal for me to narrow down. Does anyone have any advice on which to pursue? What would be the difference in experience from getting either degree? I know the difference between the fields, so no need to link me to operational definitions. I tend to straddle the border on qualitative and quantitative method preference as well. \n\nMy main research interests are poverty, institutional power and social issues, human cooperation/altruism,  and social movements. \n\nI'd only like to look at salary as a tie breaker, but lately it seems that may be what it comes down to. So many jobs I see myself doing seem to be virtually cross listed between the degrees. I'm not sure what other practical (theoretical aspects won't matter to me, as I favour parts of each) differences they may have, kind of at a stalemate. Anything helps!",

I studied sociology for two semesters and really enjoyed the subject. I've also done a semester each of Political Science and International Relations. I really enjoy interdisciplinary courses - Law and Poverty was my favorite.\n\nI would love to hear from people who have taken any of these programs. How important is a Masters degree in entering these fields? What should I do to get into a great program?

If this post is inappropriate for this sub and I have misunderstood the sidebar rules, I apologize. \n\nI'll leave it to you to look up Esperanto if you don't know what it is, and get to the point: The Esperanto-speaking community has for a long time struggled with determining our own size. I'm in search of a method to begin making estimations of how many people speak this language. \n\nIf you're interested, this Stack Exchange post will give you some background:\n\nhttp://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/1354/how-do-we-tackle-creating-an-esperantujo-census-or-begin-gaining-a-picture-of\n\n&gt;The reasons for why it is difficult are clear. It's hard to calculate the \"speakers\" of any language (and we must first define \"speaker\"), let alone a language like Esperanto, which is not one of the \"larger\" world languages, and whose speakers are not concentrated in any particular region. \n\nThis post will also give you a picture of what we're struggling with:\n\nhttp://esperanto.stackexchange.com/questions/1/how-many-esperanto-speakers-exist/105#105\n\n&gt;The number of speakers of other languages is usually estimated by concentrating on areas where they are spoken either by the majority or by a sizable minority, and using the population numbers for those areas. This approach doesn't work for Esperanto. (It also doesn't work for estimating the number of second and foreign language speakers of a language, which is why the estimates for these numbers vary much more than the estimated for native speakers in the case of widely spoken languages.)\n\n&gt;Despite the number of Esperanto speakers probably being stagnant, the usage of Esperanto has certainly increased a lot because of the advent of the Internet, which has made it easier for Esperanto speakers to actually use Esperanto. While Jouko Lindstedt's estimates were based on degree of knowledge of Esperanto, one can also make similar estimates for definitions of \"Esperanto speaker\" based on actual usage of Esperanto. Given that usage of Esperanto is more visible than knowledge of Esperanto, these estimates can be made with a bit more confidence.\n\nAny advice or help from someone who knows much more about surveys, statistics, social science, etc. than I do would be highly appreciated.

And has their been any study done to explain why other Anglo countries have adopted female leaders earlier than the US has?",

I'm wondering if there has been a serious attempt at developing a \"psychology of science\" which seeks to understand the motivations of scientists and how it might affect what knowledge we obtain. I'm thinking not about things like \"the reproducibility crisis\" -- if this is caused by how the scientific process is organized, i.e. higher order social processes and not the motivations of single researchers. But it's interesting to see, for example, how we might become attached to certain theories and hesitate to discard them when they have been shown to be wrong.\n\nThe only thing that comes to mind is cognitive biases and parts of developmental psychology/learning theory. Has there been any effort at trying to study something like this? Where's a good place to start in order to read up on this?",

        "text": "**UPDATE: I figured it out, with the help of redditors. Thank you to everyone who took the time to reply.**\n\nI have been reading up on banking and there is something puzzling me. I am hoping that someone here understands this well enough to shed light on it. \n\nFirst I will summarize some of what I understand, which is needed to contextualize my question. \n\n* Banks need reserves to cover their transactions with other banks, as customers at different banks transfer money to each other. \n\n* The money for reserves can be gotten from a few different sources, but deposits are the preferred source because they are the cheapest. This is why banks want our deposits. \n\n**Here's what I don't understand:**\n\nIf banks are short on reserves and can't afford interbank transfers, why don't they simply increase their reserve to deposit ratio? Let's say a bank holds 10% of its deposits as reserves, couldn't it simply switch to 11% or 20% or any other percent it chooses? This would instantly eliminate any shortage of reserves. \n\nBut instead of doing that, they deal with reserve shortages by borrowing short-term from other banks or the central bank, even though this must be paid for with interest. \n\nI researched this question and the only explanation I could find is that banks prefer to keep a low reserve to deposit ratio so that they have more deposit money available to make loans with. But this contradicts what I learned elsewhere, which is that banks do not lend out deposits. Loans create deposits rather than deposits being used to create loans. (One credible source for this is the [Bank of England's \"Money Creation in the Modern Economy\"](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q102.pdf))\n\nSo what's going on here? \n\n**Do banks in fact rely on deposits to make loans? Or is there some other reason why they won't respond to reserve shortages by increasing their reserve to deposit ratio?**",

        "text": "I've heard the claim that significant differences exist within political parties, but I don't actually know the literature on this topic. I'm just speaking anecdotally here, but it seems there may be groups of rural, working class democrats that are pro-union, but diverge from the Democratic Party on many other issues (e.g., immigration, racial issues, etc.). Similarly, there may be urban, intellectual class republicans that tend to diverge from the Republican Party in many ways (e.g., LGBT issues, military intervention, religiosity, etc.). \n\nPerhaps the examples I made up above aren't empirically supported, but it seems likely that there are some factions within political parties that hold divergent views. Why do these factions coexist? What brings them together politically? Haidt seems potentially relevant here, but would his broad characterizations of differences among the moral psychologies of republicans and democrats provide any insight into intragroup differences?",
