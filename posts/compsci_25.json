Also, I realize this is a very open ended question so any advice would be awesome.\n\nBrief introduction: I'm an undergraduate math major with a lot of cs theory experience and moderate coding experience from tech internships. I've worked on a few personal projects mostly related to my math interests or automating things in my daily routine. I'm realizing that I'll have a lot of time this summer to work on projects.\n\nI should admit that this is partially motivated by the desire to pad my resume, however open source projects are something that I have used and taken advantage of a lot in my computer science career and I would love to give back. There were many times where I really wanted to contribute to things, but I've never really felt like I was competent enough to be contributing (at this point I think I'm realizing that I will never feel like that and it's okay). Is that fairly normal? \n\nWhat is the best way to start contributing? I would love to do something related to math or visualization, but I also have a ton of time and would be excited to learn something new. \n",

This I also find understandable as a^n b^n cannot be constructed with a regular grammar. But I'm not sure I really have understood it, so this question:\n\nWhat is with a grammar that produces words like a^m b^n for n,m in Natural Numbers. I could have a regular grammar like S-&gt;aA, A-&gt;aA, A-&gt;b, A-&gt;bB, B-&gt;bB, B-&gt;b. So as these rules are permitted, I clearly have a regular language in the end. But how can I construct a pumping lemma automaton with only one cycle that recognizes this language? As I understand it, if I cannot find an automaton with one cycle, this is not a regular language but that would be contradictory to the Grammar above.\n",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nIf you're reading this, you're most likely interested in learning about quantum computing; however, you might not be sure how to get started because of a lack of people to work with, lack of direction, and maybe even a lack of a bit of background knowledge.\n\nI've created a subreddit, /r/MikeAndIke, which will enable people with the desire to learn about quantum computing to come together and learn, generally directed (though not entirely restricted) by the book Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang (hence the name, Mike &amp; Ike).\n\nI'm very new to reddit in general, as you can see by my karma scores, and so I'm extremely new to running a subreddit. But, I hope that together we can make this a great learning experience for each other! There is also a discord chat going, which may possibly be more helpful than my subreddit will end up being, but I think only time will tell that for us.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or any other comments, feel free to spread the word to people you think may be interested, and I'll continue to look forward to your arrival (and also continue to make my subreddit look less ugly).\n\n-Foobanana (the real one)\n\nEdit: Yes, I know that this isn't exactly computer science; I just wanted to try to reach out to anyone possible who may be interested, just because quantum computing is so very interdisciplinary.",
