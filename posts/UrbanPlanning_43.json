        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/82ka1e/a_story_written_from_arguing_with_antidevelopers/",
        "text": "I've been long-arguing with a set of stead-fast anti-developers on various forums over the need to open up our city's zoning code. Currently the city is working to do something in that vein, but is still relegating the vast majority of projected, near tripling of, growth to a mere ~25% of the land area. The more I've argued with them, the more I've come to consider the core of the issue to not be really be the integrity of 'neighborhood character' as is often held up in defense of quarantining growth, but rather, one of simple, if subconscious, personal greed.\n\nSome of them speak of a fear of loosing things like character, but what does that mean? Someone can give me some hand-wavy stuff about the feel of the neighborhood, or it's quaintness, or its quietness, or whatever, but what the 'character' really is, is a manifestation of an individual's want to live there. It is an internal metric that's fairly unquantifiable, yet results in one person willing to buy into the area in a very quantifiable way.\n\nGet enough people together who like the 'character' of the neighborhood, and you get the overall demand for living there, which, in-turn, drives the property values.\n\nIf there are enough homes, at the current values, to satisfy everyone who wants to live there, then there's no issue. Property values don't go up, but neither does anyone go without a home. Then again, why should any individual want that? They bought a home, and have been lied to a bunch, and so think that a home must be a guaranteed return on investment. There must be some profit out of it, otherwise how could they hope to retire!?\n\nNow, the person may be worried that the specific things that they liked about an area are necessary to keep people moving in. They aren't correct, of course, since there are enough varieties of people to enjoy most new things that would come to the area. After all, a new cafe wouldn't have come in if the owners didn't think they could get enough customers to make it work. Still, though, the person feels as if they must preserve the original neighborhood's elements without changing them at all to maintain their resale value.\n\nOn the other hand, they may be more blunt about it, and simply not want any new houses built to explicitly create a shortage.\n\nEither way, demand is not met because that person, and a bunch of their neighbors who are thinking the same, get together to force laws into place that restrict the ability to build new things to meet the demand to live in the area. They operate under the idea that they have some kind of right to control the future of the neighborhood without consideration to those who's future they're affecting.\n\nWell, things go great, for a while. Values go up, and most of the maturing people, who are well-along in their careers, can afford the rising taxes. A few poorer members get priced out and are forced to sell, but so what? They get a nice pay-check and a lovely new young couple moves in. Of course... that new couple is making quite a bit more money than the existing residents were when they were that age (even adjusted for inflation). Oh well, who cares?\n\nTime goes on, and the city grows, adding more and more jobs. More people want to live in the neighborhood, but there's not enough new housing for them, so prices keep going up. More people are priced out, or simply choose on their own to sell. The only people who can buy into the area are the more and more wealthy. Those few houses which are allowed to be torn down are rebuilt bigger, and more fancy than any of the original homes, though, to meet the tastes of the rising income levels wanting to move into the neighborhood.\n\nNew shops and boutiques open in the area, buying out the existing commercial space since the lack of new commercial area means leases have gone up, and the long-running stores that were there can no longer keep up with prices. Those existing residents, and many of the earlier new arrivals, don't mind. They can afford the new places, after all.\n\nStill no new housing, and no new commercial space is allowed, for fear that it would change the neighborhood. Ignore, however, that the average incomes are rising, the new houses are much larger than older ones, that shops are being replaced, and that change is already here.\n\nEventually, demand goes so unmet that a developer can justify the high costs needed to fight the neighbors and the laws they had put in place. The developer can justify the millions extra they must spend for parking garages, and meeting community aesthetic standards, and sacrificing land to unneeded set backs, and dedicating land to 'green space' that is unneeded due to the near-by neighborhood park, and sitting through the layers of beuocracy and meetings and review boards and public comment periods. Eventually, after much fussing and cussing, a new apartment complex is built. The only apartments that can be built and still turn a profit are 'luxury' units. High cost, minimal real luxury, but they get filled regardless as only a small portion of the pent-up demand is met.\n\nOf course there are those who don't want the complex because it threatens their incorrect assumptions about the 'character' needing to be preserved at all costs to maintain values. After all, there are enough people who want to live in the apartments to justify building the thing in the first place, and that the new cafes and shops built on its bottom floor offer more options for potential home-owners to go out and do things, meaning values will be fine.\n\nThere will be those, though, who don't want it simply because they fear that it will lower their return on investment. If the demand is met, after all, then values stop going up. If more demand is met than has to be, then prices don't go up as much as they could, and then existing property owners get less money than they could.\n\nThere will even be those who come at things from the other direction. Who see the expensive apartments, without seeing the train of events leading to them, and inaccurately blame the developers for the high prices. They will call the developer greedy and blame them for not building more affordable units.\n\nAll three, though, will agree that new developments must be restricted further, either for the character, or to 'help the little man', or to just further pad out their retirement funds.\n\nNone of this would be so bad if it were relegated to a few neighborhoods, but when done city-wide, or at least over large-swaths of the city, you create a scenario where the average prices can't help but rise. New people coming to the city must be able to pay more and more and more on average to be able to live there.\n\nAs the neighborhoods' character continues to change, no matter what some may say to the contrary, the city becomes less and less available to more and more people. Those who could have otherwise afforded to live in the city - near its services, and amenities, and resources - are now relegated further and further away. They are trapped by lengthening commutes, rising transportation costs, and fewer support resources within reach. Those who are least able to afford it, are either burdened with higher costs of living further away or the higher costs of rising housing prices. In many cases, depending on the metro's policies as a whole, they can easily find themselves trapped in both.\n\nThat's okay, though, because some people got to pretend that they defended their neighborhood's character, and that it's okay to restrict supply so much. It's just a coincidence that they're personally getting paid better for their efforts. At least, they'll get paid better as long as there are rich people to buy in, but there's no shortage of those, right? Certainly no long-term sustainability issues are being built in by keeping people trapped in situations where it's much harder for them to build wealth, coupled with over all slow, or in some cases stagnant, wage growth.",

The classes would be some mix of the following:\n\n- Seminar in Housing\n- Capital Facilities Planning\n- Real Estate Finance \n- Transportation Planning and Economics\n- Transportation and Land Use\n- Public Transportation \n- Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation \n- Sustainable Coastal Planning\n\nSo I obviously at two classes a semester, it would take forever to take all of these, so that's a no go. We all know having GIS skills in planning is a plus, but for the most part is having a whole cert worth of GIS understanding really that important for a planner? \n\nShould I do the GIS cert, or just take one or two of the GIS classes (bringing my total to two or three) and just mix in some classes from the rest of the non GIS classes?

Certain Lands of Louisville, Kentucky. \n\nBriefly, my understanding is that the Federal Government attempted to condemn properties using the idea of \"police power\" (rather than the power of Eminent Domain) to acquire these lands and presumably not have to pay the just compensation required of a takings in order to create a slum clearance project. The court held that the Federal Government was not clothed with such police power and the condemnation was unlawful.\n\nSo, does the Federal Government have the same police power of States and Cities to protect the Health, Safety, Morals and General Welfare of its citizens? According to Wikipedia (the most trusted of sources), the Tenth Amendment would imply that powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the States and people. So does the Federal Government not have police power at all, or is their police power fundamentally different, or is it just relegated to eminent domain?",

Is there any role a student/physician can play in this field? I've heard before about  the usage of Health Impact Assessments in local projects. Could anyone provide some info regarding that (or any other way I could get involved tbh).\n\nAnything at all would be appreciated, I'm serious about my interest and would love to make even the smallest contribution to my community.

For those of you who have graduated from a masters program, if you could do it all over again, how would you best spend your time while in school? Did you find that too many theory courses or \"social justice\" course do not apply to your work as a professional planner?  I.E. Would you have focused more on GIS over economic/community development courses, because the skills from the former are required for advancement in your position/field? Things of that nature.\n\nBasically i am interested in what planning professionals feel about their graduate programs and if it would be in ones best interest to put aside some personal planning passions in order to build a better/more efficient planning portfolio for a career in planning\n\nP.S. For those of you who did not attend graduate school.  What were some of the more difficult concepts/aspects of your job to learn?\n\nP.P.S I have aspirations to eventually do community development work overseas( developing counties). For those planners serving in that capacity I would love to hear how you got involved and what helped you land an International planning position.\n\nAny info would be wonderful! And good luck to all those who are still waiting to hear back!\n\n\n\n",

I am a bit confused about the differences between:\n\n\ncity planning\n\nurban design (why is this only a post graduate MS in most schools?)\n\ncity planning with a focus in urban design\n\nstructural engineering\n\n(Landscape) architecture \n\n\nI am a very analytical thinker and enjoy solving problems in creative ways.  I like math but I would like an area that could combine the analytical side with a more creative outlet. I have always had a fascination with what makes cities great. I love looking at mix-use projects (ie PCM, the highline parks) and seeing how they all integrate together and get used by the public. \n\n\nI tend to be more forward thinking than some of my peers. I would rather challenge the status quo than to conform to the methodology that things should be done the same as they were in the past.  I am not very interested in public policy.  I would like to be able to design and see my work come to fruition.\n\n\nDo any of those afforemention majors have that creative/analytical integration and forward thought that I would be looking for? Is there something else I should be striving for? What is the job outlook for these areas?\n\n",

Just some info on the tools of the trade would be really helpful but if you happen to feel strongly about something or another I would love to hear that as well! \n\nI'm not really familiar with the day-to-day of planners so any insight is appreciated!

I have, however, always been fascinated by taking an interdisciplinary approach to the world especially when it comes to linking technology into the development of urban, suburban, and rural areas (and everything else in between). Transit is something that especially fascinates me. I am currently looking into concepts like systems thinking, agent-based modeling, and scale. I am considering a minor in Urban Studies, but I am not sure if it will be valuable. I am currently working on getting involved on existing projects that deal with my passions, but my school's computer science department focuses on more theoretical topics rather than how we merge theory with practicality (theory is important, but I am more of a person who likes to apply knowledge). I will appreciate any advice for moving forward. ",
