        "text": "After so much buzz and prodding from my friends I finally watched The Rehearsal on HBO. It really is as bizarre as people have made it out to be. I watched the first four episodes and wanted to see some other reactions so I started coming across articles and was really surprised. \n\n[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-cruel-and-arrogant-gaze-of-nathan-fielders-the-rehearsal](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-cruel-and-arrogant-gaze-of-nathan-fielders-the-rehearsal)\n\nArticles like this make it seem like the show's proposal of rehearsing is actually the point of the show. I've also seen some posts and comments here that allude to the same. I don't think that's it at all. I think it's just an incredibly elaborate way to get laughs out of the viewer. Nathan doesn't actually believe he's helping these people. He's playing a neurotic character that thinks he is. The idea that you could remotely predict how everything possibility of human interaction could go is the most futile effort I've ever heard. It's an incredible elaborate concept, but at the end of the day I think the only point of it is to create awkward interactions to make the viewer laugh.",

Rottentomatoes took down the user reviews for the preside but it was in the 50% range as well.\n\nNot that these ratings matter all that much in the grand scheme, but it has really opened my eyes to the reality of these miserable \"anti-SJW\" \"anti-woke\" people\n\nI generally consider myself to be a centrist politically, maybe even right leaning. But I now understand that there's this category of anti-woke people on the right and their opinions cannot be trusted. They're operating with this woke detector mind software at all times that makes them unable to enjoy anything. Just the sight of a gay character makes them think it's some propaganda.\n\nFirst off everyone knows the vast majority of Hollywood and game devs are progressive liberals, as creative people tend to be. So good luck enjoying anything ever again if you think this way. Everything is gonna seem like propaganda.\n\nBy the way I don't remember people reacting to The Wire or The Sopranos this way when they introduced gay characters. Omar Little was out there kissing dudes in damn near every episode. This seems like some new stupid ass culture war social media phenommenon.",

This show pulled me in immediately right up to the very last 2 minutes of the second episode. It's probably just me, but im not the type to enjoy violent nor gory scenes at all. I was pleasantly surprised when the show started off on a very positive \"there something mysterious going on here but its beneficial to everyone\" type vibe. Unfortunately that all crumbled the minute it go up to&gt;!the murder scene!&lt;. I'm just disappointed there are no good supernatural/sci-fi type shows for people like me who don't need to see people dying left right and center all the time or if there is death it doesn't need to be displayed gorily. Other than that the show started off good. Just wishing someone might come up with a MODERN series (show was inclusive from the get-go) but also stays feel-good without it being comedy nor boring day to day life.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/10v1dpv/personal_opinion_on_uncoupled_season_1_cancelled/",
        "text": "After hearing its cancellation from this post \"[https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/10bbrny/uncoupled\\_canceled\\_after\\_one\\_season\\_at\\_netflix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/10bbrny/uncoupled_canceled_after_one_season_at_netflix/)\" I'm pretty saddened such a good show is cancelled and a quite realistic viewpoint from a relationship for all characters. It explores so much more than most romance TV show I've seen, I mean sure there are some clichés but it still followed what most real people do in those situations.\n\nAnyway, the thing is I'm not gay myself and an undisclosed friend of mine let's call it \"Zee\", watched the entirety of the season together. Zee is pretty much homophobic in today's standards but doesn't go around publicly announcing it nor condemn people who are homosexual, just that Zee does not understand well enough why people are gay. Nor will ever understand cause Zee finds it disgusting when Zee sees no matter which same-sex-gender they are, were to kiss each other. Even if I tried explaining to Zee that certain people have different brain-functions and whatsoever that made them gay nor even if I find articles it's a lost cause.\n\nBUT, why am I really saddened? Because this show actually made Zee understood a lot of gay relationships is pretty much alike with other opposite sex relationships, the only difference is the topics these gay men talk about, circle of friends and that they are same gender. Like there is the f-boy of the group like any other f-boy you see in male friend-groups, there is one night stands and even cheating among gay people which is just like many other shallow straight people, there is them trying to find their true love, lost love, friend that believed they will be single forever/insecure and more. Just like a straight relationship, that it explored so much and showed the world that just because these gay men are gay doesn't mean they're better people/worst people nor anything but just normal people doing normal things. Bottom line is that it showed me and Zee and I want to believe many people a chance to take a glimpse into gay people relationships(friends/lovers) and how its just like everyone else's even mine.\n\nSo for the first time ever I see Zee wasn't feeling disgusted at all seeing them kiss(even s-x scenes) nor that seeing them embrace each other, rather Zee found it very fond of their love for each other and Zee was really interested in watching an episode after another. Zee was finally understanding how these relationship works and I'm pretty happy that Zee can reach a new level of compassion/understanding towards other people who are just different in gender preferences.\n\n The show has so much more potential and that **the thing I find most attractive about it is that it had no LGBTQ+ agenda, just like any other couple/romance show it is, shown to the world like as it is. There's no \"you should support because they are gay\" but rather a very truthful reality that was explored within a relationship that made me forget that it's a show about a gay couple. It felt like as if I'm watching another straight couple's romance genre, which is more realistic than most gay couple shows you can find, its nothing like mainstream media nor any indie shows.**\n\nSo my main concern is that most shows that include **gay people doesn't really show how** **real people talk. It's always added with dialogues of confrontation with another homophobic person that just defeats the purpose** of a **CHARACTER** within a show**, because of such confrontations they became a tool for an agenda and no longer a character that is interesting nor explorable for their emotions, motivations but now only known as \"the gay guy/girl\" within a group for the show.**\n\nTL;DR: Uncoupled is the first show I find how a real gay people talk and act in real life and it explores more into their **character** than any other shows that just \"includes\" gay people and not do them justice. That made my friend understood how gay people are just like many other straight people and aren't so different/weird/agenda-aggressive after all, just a preconception of mainstream media.",

I know people who’ve been on hold for at least an hour trying to book a routine appointment with their pediatrician for their children. This trope isn’t saddening or maddening at all, but it brings me out of the moment and thinking of the show I’m watching more in a meta sort of way more than being completely immersed in their world. This is more noticeable in dramas and thrillers, more than sitcoms, of course, where it isn’t really a factor and inconsequential.\n\nWhat are your tropes that briefly break your immersion and remind you it’s just a scripted show?",

But people WANT to believe in him, and embrace the idea of putting together what had fallen apart.\n\nCostner's movie didn't quite capture the whole thing, nor does this summary. But the book's exploration of society, individualism, myth, America, belief and more, combined with the ongoing audiences for apocalyptic tales of Fallen Civilization, makes me think that it would have real potential as a miniseries with a lot to explore.",

I'm sure people on this sub had threads before about why so many sitcoms like Seinfeld, Friends, etc are drinking so much coffee. That isn't my question though. I think what I am more interested in finding out is why so many of them drink coffee AT NIGHT.\n\nThere wasn't a specific trigger that caused me to bring this up. But a few years ago, I binged Seinfeld and Friends. Recently I've been watching a bit of Fraiser and while Fraiser and Niles typically drink sherry at night and coffee during the day, I think I recalled there were a few times where they drank coffee at night. And recently I've just started a game called Chicken Police and I'm at the beginning and the characters are going to a coffee place at night.\n\nSo it's really the night thing that bothers me for these particular reasons:\n\n* Who the hell is actually drinking coffee at night or even after 6pm. Like you are not going to be able to get to bed right?\n* Even if it's decaffe, why? Alcohol has been around for a long time and it's typically more of a night drink\n* It's not product placement either because they aren't advertising a particular type of brand\n* Maybe it's my area in LA, but unless it's Starbucks, coffee shops aren't even open that late\n\nSo what is the reason for this?",

        "text": "Hey.\n\nSo, as many of you’re well aware, there are more and more podcasts about shows that have both been off the air for years and also some that are running concurrently. I’m specifically referring to the former in this post.\n\nI listen to both podcasts about some shows hosted by fans with no connection to behind the scenes and also some which are hosted by some of the actors. Podcasts like Office Ladies and Fake Doctors, Real Friends (Scrubs) are very insightful but also it’s quite interesting how there are occasions when they’re honest and admit an episode is bad or not their favorite but also admit the more subtle details and Easter eggs they didn’t know of at the time and only found out later from diehard fans. I guess that’s because it’s more a gig for them and they don’t endlessly analyze every single angle of their show in their free time because they get enough of it at work.\n\nI’m very much more like the hosts in that regard in that I’m not one of those kinds of fans who analyzes every little thing and there are a lot of things in the background of a shot or some other subtle detail that I don’t pick up on and even the shows I’ve seen the most there are often years between rewatches. For instance, until recently, I hadn’t seen Scrubs since its final season was actually airing over a decade ago. \n\nListening to these podcasts is refreshing because of the honesty (most of the time, anyway, there may be some moments of exaggeration or misremembering from time to time, they’re human) and these actors criticizing certain elements as they’re critiquing some character writing choices from an episode is just a reminder that honesty is often the best policy (as opposed to feigning liking something due to an affiliation/obligation to a show).\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

There is so money comedy to be mined from Holiday episodes with Laurie and her probably white trash kids (hello new Hyde?)\n\n\n2: We need to see the Kelso's house some of the interactions with the new kids and Kelso and Jackie:\n\nI need to see what Jackie and Kelso's life is like. I dont need full episodes, but we always got little glimpses into the parents' lives of the main cast. It would be funny to see life from thier basement.\n\n3: More Bob, he should move back to Point Place:\n\nMore Bob, more better \n\n\n4: Grunge music. I need that Alt Rock/ Grunge music scene:\n\nMusic was a big part of \"That 70's Show\", and that needs to continue. We need that 90's Member Berries to get us through\n\n5: If the final season isn't A Kelso/ Forman wedding and everything that goes with it, what are we even doing?\n\nSeriously; a wedding planning, extended family/ In-Law hijinks season could be really fun and a great way to tie everything together.",

The UK has a higher success rate for top tier comedies but when America gets the planets alligned you get the quality of UK sitcoms but with 20x the episodes.\n\nWhat in your opinion is the main difference between both styles of comedy? Down to the little things\n\nUS\n\n1. Malcolm in the Middle\n2. South Park\n3. The Simpsons (would be no. 2 if south park didn't have the better later series)\n4. The Oblongs\n5. Nanny (I think that's what it was called, it's more nostalgia than anything but upon rewatching it holds up)\n\n\nUK\n\n1. Fawlty towers\n2. I'm Alan partridge\n3. Blackadder\n4. Black Books\n5. The Ricky Gervais show (count just the animated series if you want)",
