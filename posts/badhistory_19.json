        "text": "This is part 2 of our look at *A History of the Past: Life Reeked with Joy*, found here http://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/winter-2014-four-decades-of-classic-essays/history-past-life-reeked-with-joy/\n\nThe parts I didn't get to in part 1 have already been thoroughly and hilariously raked over in that post's comments, so this might be redundant/shit. But I figured I might as well finish it up. So here we go!\n\n&gt;The Reformnation happened when German nobles resented the idea that tithes were going to Papal France or the Pope thus enriching Catholic coiffures...An angry Martin Luther nailed 95 theocrats to a church door. Theologically, Luthar was into reorientation mutation.\n\nOff to a good start. /s  I have no clue what \"Papal France\" is supposed to mean, probably the Avignon Papacy, even though that ended in 1377. The following sentence brings to mind some sort of alt-history metal Luther, which does sound pretty badass.\n\n&gt;The Popes, of course, were usually Catholic.\n\n(⌐■_■)\n\n( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■ \n\n(•_•)\n\n[ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)] http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/830/b49.gif\n\n&gt;The last Jesuit priest died in the 19th century.\n\nPope Francis don't real?\n\n&gt;Louis XIV became King of the Sun. He gave the people food and artillery. If he didn’t like someone, he sent them to the gallows to row for the rest of their lives. \n\nHe gave who food and artillery?...his armies I guess? European monarchs never were really keen on giving out food, much less artillery, to peasants. I suppose a king *could* sentence someone to death just because he didn't like him...but did that really ever happen? At least there's a kernel of truth in here, that King Louis XIV did send thousands of criminals to life sentences of rowing in galleys.\n\n&gt;In Russia the 17th century was known as the time of the bounding of the serfs. Russian nobles wore clothes only to humour Peter the Great.\n\nNo, Peter the Great instituted several sweeping reforms, including Westernizing the clothing of the nobility, as part of a greater effort to modernize Russia. The nobility did not, in fact, wear clothes for the sole purpose of amusing the Tsar.\n\n&gt;Taxation was a great drain on the state budget. The French revolution was accomplished before it happened.\n\nwat\n\n&gt;History, a record of things left behind by past generations, started in 1815. \n\nR5: stuff did happen before 1815 actually\n\n&gt;Among the goals of the chartists were universal suferage and an anal parliment.\n\n(ಠ_ಠ)\n\n**(ಠ◡ಠ)**\n\n&gt;World War I broke out around 1912–1914.\n\nNo, it actually broke out in 1914. In July. On the 28th. Who knew.\n\n&gt;In 1937 Lenin revolted Russia. Communism raged among the peasants\n\nLenin led the Bolsheviks in revolution in *1917*, not 1937. \n\n&gt;Moosealini rested his foundations on eight million bayonets and invaded Hi Lee Salasy. \n\nNon-rhetorical question, what is \"Hi Lee Salasy\" supposed to be?\n\n&gt;Germany invaded Poland, France invaded Belgium, and Russia invaded everybody. \n\nThis is my favorite description of World War II I have ever heard, and it does make one *spicy* flair. But it's complete hogwash. France did not invade Belgium, Germany did...how do you even mess that up. And \"Russia\" didn't invade \"everyone\"...by the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the USSR annexed a handful of Baltic states, and besides them, the ~~only~~* country they invaded was Germany (and arguably Japan, as Manchuria was a Japanese holding at the time). \n\n*I am a dolt\n\n&gt;War screeched to an end when a nukuleer explosion was dropped on Heroshima. \n\nThe U.S. dropped the nuclear bomb *Little Boy* on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The Japanese surrender wasn't accepted and formalized until September 2, almost a month later.\n\n&gt;A whole generation had been wipe out in two world wars, and their forlorne families were left to pick up the peaces.\n\nAn heroes\n\n\nAnd thus ends the trial of *A History of the Past: Life Reeked with Joy*, its sentence is eternal mockery. I hope you all had a good time!\n\nSources:^I don't^actually know^anything\n\n\nBonus: THERE'S MORE https://books.google.com/books?id=K_vWQWrnh78C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false",

Let's do this.\n\n\n&gt;During the Middle Ages, everybody was middle aged.\n\nHuh, TIL.\nActually though, humans do, in fact, age.\n\n&gt;Middle Evil society was made up of monks, lords, and surfs.\n\nI think the author was trying to say something about the familiar \"nobility, clergy, peasants\" hierarchy? But most clergy were priests, not monks. \nSerf's up, dude.\n\n&gt;After a revival of infantile commerce slowly creeped into Europe, merchants appeared...They roamed from town to town exposing themselves\n\n(﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nNot quite.\n\n&gt;Mideval people were violent. Murder during this period was nothing. Everybody killed someone.\n\nNo! What? Just...no. There had been whole systems of laws since the days of the Roman Republic; people didn't just abandon them and suddenly accept murder. Beginning with the initiatives of Henry II, medieval England, for example, had established law codes, and murder was most definitely not \"nothing\".^1 It's definitely incorrect to say that \"everybody killed someone\", in fact, I highly doubt that *most* people ever killed anyone.\n\n&gt;In the 1400 hundreds most Englishmen were perpendicular.\n\nAs we all know, it was common for the 15th century Englishman to walk around at a permanent 90° bow.\nI can't even fathom what he was trying to say here.\n\n&gt;A class of yeowls arose.\n\nUmm...I guess he means yeomen?\n\n&gt;Victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks.\n\nNo, bubonic plague victims did not grow breasts on their necks.\n\n&gt;The plague also helped the emergance of the English language as the national language of England, France and Italy.\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT\nI'm not sure why he thinks the bubonic plague had anything to do with the evolution of the English language, but WHAT \"national language of France and Italy\" France was not a unified state^2 and there wasn't some sort of pan-French identity or language, not for a long time. In southern France, for example, Occitan continues to be spoken by some 1.5 million people.^3 And Italy (again, not a singular, unified country) spoke, you guessed it, *ITALIAN*. Where does he even come up with this crap?\n\n&gt;The Middle Ages slimpared to a halt. The renasence bolted in from the blue. Life reeked with joy. Italy became robust, and more individuals felt the value of their human being.\n\nHmm the Renaissance wasn't a sudden thing just out of the blue; for centuries, ancient Greek and Roman writings had been read and distributed in Western Europe. As for the \"individuals felt the value of their human being\" part, I think he's referring to Humanism? Which certainly *is* important, but wasn't adopted by most Renaissance-era Italians because most Italians were commoners with no education? \n\nThis is getting pretty long so I'll post part 2 tomorrow. Up next: the \"Reformnation\", \"Voltare\", \"A new time zone of national unification\", \"Versigh\", \"Moosealini\", and \"Heroshima\"!\n\n^1 https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1247fn/its_year_xxxx_of_your_specialty_a_dead_body_is/c6s1e6t\n^2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_France#/media/File:Trait%C3%A9_de_Bretigny.svg\n^3 https://www.britannica.com/topic/Occitan-language",

        "text": "Recently I found this [delightful gem of bad history.](http://creativewritingguild.com/tips-tricks/9-tips-to-start-world-building/) It is nice to get honest misunderstanding, instead of garbled hate once in a while. ( And actually I believe it was produced by putting Dan Carlin into a blender.)\n\n&gt;Blackhand assassins tried to kill a visiting Duke, but each assassin failed spectacularly due to timing and mechanical failures. Then the Duke stopped for a sandwich across the street from the last assassin’s fallback location. Once the Duke was killed the assassin tried to run and took an old cyanide capsule that only made him sick. He tried to drown himself by jumping off a bridge, but just flopped into a muddy riverbed where he was arrested and the plot’s details were discovered.\n\nFor starters he was not any old visiting Duke, but [Franz Ferdinand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria) was Archduke of Austria-Este, Austro-Hungarian and Royal Prince of Hungary and of Bohemia, and from 1896 until his death, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne.\n\n&gt; Then the Duke stopped for a sandwich across the street from the last assassin’s fallback location.\n\nPrincip's position was actually in front of Schiller's delicatessen, but: [First the myth is,](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2frp4r/did_princip_just_get_lucky_when_he_assassinated/) that Princip was eating a sandwich, not the archduke. And second, the myth is not only debunked, but actually traced back to a Brazillian alternate history novel. Thats like meta-badhistory.\n\n&gt; Once the Duke was killed the assassin tried to run and took an old cyanide capsule that only made him sick. He tried to drown himself by jumping off a bridge, but just flopped into a muddy riverbed where he was arrested and the plot’s details were discovered.\n\nWrong assassin, wrong assassination attempt but at least right day and city. On the Archduke's way to the city hall several members of the Black Hand were laying in ambush, one of them was Vaso Čabrinović. Čabrinović throws a bomb, misses and injures several bystanders. He then takes cyanide, jumps into the river, sprains his ankle, vomits from the cyanide and gets arrested and beaten up by the crowd. Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie escape this  attempt and drive to the city hall, where the Archduke expresses his dismay about being \"greeted by bombs\" when the major of  Sarajevo reads his prepared remarks. Afterwards they want to drive to the hospital. On the way the driver loses his way, tries to turn the car, just in front of Princep, who is not eating a sandwich.\n\n\n---\n\nI mostly used [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDedijer1966313-63) as a source, but in the process I stumbled over some rather nice primary sources:\n\n[*Heir to Austria's throne is slain with hist wife by a Bosnian Youth to avenge seizure of his country*, New York Times, June 29, 1914](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E06E3D9113FE633A2575AC2A9609C946596D6CF)\n\n[Das Attentat auf den Thronfolger Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand am 28.

But this is some bad history, and how. Where to start?\n\nI guess let's go with the general knowledge before we even start citing sources: the whole reason 5 people were shot in the Boston Massacre in the first place was because colonists were rioting. By bringing it up at all, the meme completely contradicts itself.\n\nSimple enough, and I could stop there, but on this board? Never. Pedantry forever. The meme implies that colonists never rioted in the fashion we might see today, but pretty much everyone knows about the Boston Tea Party, which featured, gasp, local destruction of private property! So there's one example we all learned about in like, 2nd grade.\n\nBut let's put that very famous example aside for a second. We know from historians like T.H. Breen that rioting was not entirely rare. In fact, in *American Insurgents,* that is basically Breen's whole point. He notes such acts as arson, destruction of property, intimidation, and extremely personal acts of violence. This meme seems to be implying that colonists never committed such acts, even though the historical record is very clear on this. Again, I don't want to get into Rule 2, but I really haven't seen anyone be tarred and feathered recently, nor have I seen reports of boiling tea being forced down people's throats before they are ridden out of town on a rail.\n\nAll of this is to say that regardless of any personal opinions on any riots anywhere, Revolutionary America had more than its share of riots and other violent acts against people and property. They are amply recorded and professional historians from Breen to Wood to have written on them. To imply otherwise is simply not good history.",

        "text": "Hiii /r/badhistory~~\n\nI've been lurking in this sub a little for the last few days, or weeks. Time passes quickly these days, huh? I was checking new waters, hoping to see if I can resettle here after forum.istorija.net pretty much died. forum.istorija.net is more commonly (\"commonly\") known as Forum of Lithuanian History - it is our own little comfy site where we can discuss Lithuanian history together. We do a lot of refuting badhistory just like you do, and we have inside jokes just like you - I even posted one in the title, it's comparing someone terrible at history, yet dangerously influential in their field to [Mikola Yermalovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikola_Yermalovich). Although, in this instance the term is not very accurate...\n\nI was thinking that I could introduce myself by refuting a somewhat infamous Lithuanian historian, or pseudohistorian in this regard, follower of Česlovas Gelgaudas (...you should gasp here, it's not a good sign) - Rimantas Matulis - and his... less than sane theories about the Balts. It's a bit of an older article, from 2003, posted in newspaper \"Lietuvos aidas\" (\"Echo of Lithuania\" - I have respect for it for being the only news source in Lithuania to actually take up on popularizing history, but ALL of their articles are filled with badhistory). There is no original source, it's been deleted along with Matulis's own site, but [here is a link to the article I'll rip and tear today.](http://forum.istorija.net/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=1770&amp;DisplayType=nested&amp;setCookie=1)\n\nNotice a problem already? It's in Lithuanian. If any of you know it enough, you can try to follow, but for everyone else I will try to translate it to the best of my ability. Let's go.\n\nI'll explain what is exactly wrong later down the line.\n\n&gt;“Lietuvos aidas” 2003 12 03 \n\n&gt;A Collection of Theories of the Origin of the Lithuanian Nation\n\n&gt;Rimantas Matulis\n\n&gt;Throughout 2003 in \"Lietuvos aidas\" we have already published a few dozen articles about the origin of the Lithuanian nation. Since all these theories describe very different periods of history and are clearly different from one another, according to the wishes of the readers we have decided to put up a brief collection of all the theories of Lithuanian origin, organizing them by importance and likelihood: from Heruli (AN: In this article, Matulis refers to Heruli as \"Geruliai\" (Geruli), for reasons later described.), Aestii, Gitoni, Getae, Thracians, Dacians, Phrygians, Cimbri, Romans, Goths, Gepids, Venedi, Alans. The last four theories we categorize as \"partially false\" (AN: Keep in mind that origin from *Romans* do not fall into this category. This is what we are talking about.). We will start from the theory which the author (AN: It is common in Lithuanian non-fiction for the author to refer to himself in third person.) considers to be the most reliable/correct.\n\nSheesh... The first paragraph and we already enter badhistory territory. Keep in mind that Matulis here does not deny or argue against *any* of these theories - in fact, he gives stronger or weaker \"arguments\" for all of them. If this were correct, then everyone from Denmark to Bulgaria to Caucasus would be Balts. For those who can't immediately refute this bold claim, let me help - in this entire list, the only culture very likely to be Baltic in origin are the Aestii.  Some researchers, like Alexander M. Schenker,^[1] also deny the Venedi-Slavic connection and place them under Balts, but this is an another topic of discussion.\n\nOh, and you might have a question - where is the theory that Lithuanians originate from, well, BALTS? Well, this fellow is too cool for the establishment, just like the person he looks up to, Česlovas Gedgaudas - the same person who claimed that the Kievan Rus was a Baltic state and only later Slavicized.\n\n&gt;1.\n\nThis paragraph argues in favor of Lithuanians originating from the Heruli.\n\n&gt;Simonas Daukantas, Jonas Basanavičius, Aleksandras M. Račkus and many other historians thought, that the Geruli had a big impact in the formation of the Lithuanian tribe/nation, and they were right.\n\nHe is correct in almost this entire sentence, minus the last four words. Indeed, all three of these scientists argued in favor of the Heruli Baltic hypothesis. Indeed, numerous historians thought the same. The catch? They are all *from the 19th century or earlier*. (Minus Račkus, but nobody cares about him) And 19th century historians didn't have access to modern methods like archeological cultures, genetic tests, language reconstruction, carbon dating and others. Hell, Basanavičius thought that Thracians are ancestors to Lithuanians because there is a city in Lithuania called \"Trakai\". The Germanic hypothesis was created in the 16th century and has been discredited numerous times. \n\nSo don't use it.\n\n&gt;During the times of Rome, Heruli was the term for the inhabitants of the continuous forest massive from the banks of Vistula in the west, Smolensk-Moscow in the east, Finno-Ugric territory in the north and Ukrainian steppe in the south\n\n...no. Just no. There is just no such thing. The closest term I can find is Tacitus using \"Sarmatia\" to refer to all territory east of the Vistula. However, that's not to say that the Heruli weren't somewhere close - in the writing of Pliny the Elder,^[2] \"Hirri\" are mentioned to live beyond the Vistula along with Scirri/Scirii and Wends/Venedi. \n\n&gt;In the fourth century, even earlier according to S. Daukantas, many of them moved south, fought alongside Dacians against Rome, in 476 - along with Scirii, whose name likely originates from the Scara (now Prieglius) river in Prussia, led by Odoacer, pillaged Rome and took down the last emperor of Rome.\n\nNow we are told that the Balts destroyed Rome. As much of a patriotic feeling this gives to me, no.\n\nI won't touch the Dacian part, because the Heruli indeed were somewhere there, and go to Odoacer. First of all, he's totally forgetting the Rugii who also fought under Odoacer. Next, there is no mention of Scara/Skara being the former name for Prieglius/Pregolya River. In the works of Claudius Ptolemy, the river is referred to as *Chronos*, though whether it is Pregolya or Nemunas is still disputed (not that it matters, anyway). \"Scirii\" is likely derived from the Germanic *clean-* or *pure-blood*, as opposed to the neighbouring Bastarnae tribe, probably derived from Germanic *mixed-bloods* (compare *bastard*).\n\n&gt;The name for Heruli comes from the word \"giria\" (Lith. \"forest\"). Formerly they were called *giriai*, *giruliai* (Lith. \"forest people\"), later - \"geruliai\", \"heruliai\", \"eruliai\". After disagreements with the Byzantine emperor Justinian for their king, Heruli returned to the Eastern Baltic and, being literate, started all major Lithuanian nobility and dynastic lines.\n\nWhat's the history equivalent of \"fanfiction\"?\n\nThere is no consensus on the etymology of the name of Heruli, but it is almost CERTAINLY not this. Some researchers point to the title of *erilaz* - an early version of *earl*.^[4]\n\nThere were indeed some dealings between Justinian I and the Heruli, the former employed the latter in his campaigns, but there is no information on any major disagreements between them. Procopius mentioned that some of them moved north to Thule (likely Scandinavia, where their homeland is placed).\n\nAnd how come if the Heruli, and thus by extension the Lithuanians, were literate, how come there are no written records from the pre-13th century Baltic territories?\n\nLet's move on...\n\n&gt;2.\n\nThis theory originates Lithuanians from the Aestii.\n\n&gt;There is currently an almost universal consensus that *aestiorum gentes* (Aestii, Estii - east people) mentioned by Tacitus are our ancestors Balts.\n\nTru dat.\n\n&gt;For all intents and purposes, it's correct, but we have to mark the mention by Jordanus that Hermanaricus subjugated all Aestii \"until the farthest reaches of the Baltic Sea\", so Estonians. By the way, Estonia got it's name from Aestii (Germans called all inhabitants of the Eastern Baltic by this name). In the north, the Aestii could have reached as far as Finland. So many of Aestii were not Balts, but unrelated Finno-Ugric tribes.\n\nIt should be noted that past authors are not always correct in their location estimates - hell, the Baltics were called \"Sarmatia\" at many points in time, and we sure as hell aren't a steppe people near the Caspian Sea. Or are we... Matulis, get on it!\n\nIndeed, it's quite possible that the term \"Aestii\" was less of a reference to a culture and more of a blanket term for Eastern Baltic coast inhabitants, but remember - the major characteristic that Tacitus, Cassiodorus and Jordanes all mention about the Aestii is their monopoly in collecting amber from the shore and thus being the end point of the Amber Road. The biggest source of amber in antiquity was the Sambian peninsula and the Curonian lagoon, deep into Baltic territory. \n\nDespite the phonological similarity between Aesti and Estonia, there are no geographic connections between the two regions. One of the first Westerners to more permanently settle in the territory of Estonia were Danes, and Scandinavian sagas refer to a land called *Eistland* (which is also still the name for Estonia in modern Icelandic). A Baltic origin (compare Lithuanian *aikštė* (field)) is also possible.^[5]\n\n&gt;Also, it's unlikely that the Balts living in the upper basin of the Dniepr River - Heruli (called Drevlians in Slavic) fell under this category.\n\n...Oh for fuck's sake.\n\n&gt;According to current and past countries, our ancestors the Aestii would inhabit the territories of Prussia (AN: East Prussia, just called Prussia in Lithuania), Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nBut this paragraph is the most correct that this article will get.\n\n&gt;3.\n\nThis paragraph argues for Lithuanians originating from the Gitoni.\n\n&gt;Claudius Ptolemy mentions Gitoni between the Eastern European tribes.\n\nThere is little information on the web on what the Gitoni are, but from what I can gather, it's Ptolemy's way to refer to the Goths.^[6]\n\n&gt;According to us, the old name for Žemaitija - Samogitia - exactly means \"lower Gitoni\", as lands by the coast - Sambia, Semigallia and probably Finland (AN: Suomija in Lithuanian) all mean \"lower land\". And the name for Gitoni, like Belorussians (AN: Gudai in Lithuanian), Goths, Hittites and others all originate from the ancestors of Indo-Europeans - Getae. If Samogitians are lower Gitoni, then Lithuanians are upper Gitoni.\n\n*wipes sweat*\n\nNo. The foreign name for Žemaitija - Samogitia - does not mean \"lower Gitoni\", it is a twisted and translated name of Žemaitija.^[7] The first foreign name for the region comes from Ruthenian - *samotska sem(b)la*, meaning \"lower land\", which later gave rise to the Middle High German *Sameiten*, *Samaythen*. *Samogitia* is the Latin transliteration of the term and thus was transported to other European languages, English included.\n\nAlso, know this equalization between PIE and Getae? No? Sounds completely insane? Well Matulis came up with it in an another article of his, titled \"Getae, Heruli and the origins of Lithuanians\". It's just as cringeworthy and using miniscule evidence - for example, Matulis thinks that we must have lived in the Middle East at some point, because Negev sounds a lot like *negyva* (\"dead\").\n\nMoving on...\n\n&gt;4.\n\nThis theory originates Lithuanians from the Getae.\n\n&gt;Among the variants of the name of Samogitia, I found a particular one - Samogetia. From this, one could make the conclusion that the Lithuanians were the Getae (the Indo-Europeans)\n\nWOOHOO! Five paragraphs in and THE Indo-Europeans, ALL OF THEM, are Baltic! Or at least that's what I'm getting. I don't want to draw a strawman from this, it would be too easy. \n\nOr I would be, if Č. Gelgaudas, and by extension Matulis, didn't already equalize the Getae to the ancestors of the Indo-Europeans.^[8] Never mind that the first mention of them is in the 7th century BC and they are more modern than Ancient Greeks and Hittites, both also IE. Never mind that according to all sources, the Getae were pretty much limited to the Balkan peninsula and were likely closely related to the Dacians.\n\nSure.\n\nSure.\n\nWe are ALL Balts on this blessed day.\n\n&gt;However, saying that would not be very accurate, as the real Getae were our southwest neighbours the Jotvingiai/Yatviagi (first Getae/Getai transformed to Getvae, then g changed to j, much like \"gintaras\" (AN: \"amber\" in Lithuanian) to \"jantar'\" (AN: \"amber\" in Russian)). The first chronicles called Jotvingiai Getae around a thousand years ago. \n\nI have no words. You might think this makes sense, but it doesn't.\n\nThe name \"Jotvingiai\" comes from the land they lived in, \"Jotva\", which encompassed southern Lithuania (Dainava) and parts of Podlasie. \"Jotva\" comes from a hydronym - the river Jotva, name origin unknown.^[9] \n\nAnd no, the origin of \"jantar'\" is not correct, either. Both Lithuanian and Slavic names have the same *origin*, from Phoenician \"jainitar\", meaning \"sea-resin\", which is what it is.^[10]\n\n&gt;Our ancestors - the Corded Ware culture - likely called themselves Getae. The Balts that inhabited forests - Heruli - we can name northern Getae. This is why the Lithuanian language is the closest surviving language to Proto-Indo-European, and we are the closest successors of the Indo-Europeans.\n\nNever mind that Corded Ware is a Neolithic culture that dissipated 3000 years ago and that the Getae don't even fall into the geographic distribution of this culture, sure. Also, you can see that he's bringing the Heruli back into this.\n\nPoor Heruli. But hey, at least Matulis is correct that we are in fact Indo-Europeans... hehe...\n\n&gt;5.\n\nI'm going to die, we have only analyzed 4 of his theories so far...\n\nThis theory originates Lithuanians from the Thracians.\n\n&gt;Who doesn't know the famous theory by Jonas Basanavičius that Lithuanians originate from Thracians-Phrygians, who lived in the Balkans and Asia Minor?\n\nUh, hate to break it to you, but Basanavičius is a 19th century historian. Who had no idea about how the Indo-Europeans originated. There was no Gimbutienė in his time to give him an idea. In fact, his main argument is that he really has none.\n\n&gt;There is no debate that Getae and Thracians were close nations (\"relatives\"), just that the latter lived more in the Balkans. The name for them could have been given by the inhabitants of Troy, who retreated into the lands of Getae after losing their war against the Greeks. Along the history of the Thracians our dear Herodotus adds Bithynians, who lived in Asia Minor.\n\nI can't really say much here, this particular place is not my forte. I do remember that the Thracians were allied to Trojans in the Trojan War, but I don't think the name comes from there. If any of you have any sources to back me up here, be my guest.\n\n&gt;Simonas Daukantas gives many historic sources, where Lithuanians and Latvians are named Thracians: the works of Jan Dlugosz, Marcin Kromer, Matthaus Pratorius. In \"The writings of the Danish Kingdom\", the Semigallians are named Thracians.\n\nNever heard of that last part, so the translation is likely incorrect. I don't have the time to check if any of them named Lithuanians or Latvians as Thracians, but I'm doubtful, considering that all of them are from the Early Modern Era, over a thousand years after the destruction of Thrace.\n\nBesides, they could have been referring to \"the inhabitants of Trakai\", which is a homonym of Thracians in Lithuanian.\n\n&gt;Not only Basanavičius, but also a bunch of modern historians found a variety of place names and linguistic similarities between Thracian and Lithuanian languages. There are a number of locations in Lithuania named after Thracia: Trakų miestas, Trakininkai, Trakiškiai, Trakiškiemiai, Traksėdai, etc. But since Thracians are a part of the Indo-Europeans (Getae), these theories are closely related.\n\nOkay, here's the deal.\n\nIn Lithuanian, the name for Thracians is \"trakai\", which is also the name of the former capital of Lithuania, among other names. Easy to be confused if you've never studied or spoke in Lithuanian before. All these names actually come from the plural or singular form of the word *trakas*, meaning \"glade\" or \"burned forest\".\n\nNot fucking Thracia out of all things. I'm also not aware of the similarities between Thracian and Lithuanian, but considering both are Indo-European languages, it's to be expected. Latin and Lithuanian also have some similarities and common words, and nobody's originating Lithuanians from Romans...\n\n...wait. [Shit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palemonids)\n\n&gt;6.\n\nThis theory originates Lithuanians from Dacians. The Dacians and Thracians *might* be in the Balto-Slavic branch according to some scholars,^[11] but such a claim is less likely than Venedi being Balts.\n\n&gt;According to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, who lived in the 1st century BC, the northern border of Dacian populated territories reached the Baltic Sea, so the Baltic populated Baltic coast must have belonged to Dacia.\n\nNot sure on Agrippa's interpretation of the size of Dacia and whether this is correct, but Claudius Ptolemy clearly marks Dacia to be smaller than that. According to Hrushevskyi,^[12] *\"Dacia, as described by Ptolemy, occupied the region between the Tisa, Danube, upper Dnister, and Seret, while the Black Sea coast — namely, the Greek colonies of Tyras, Olbia, and others — were included in Lower Moesia.\"*\n\n&gt;Basanavičius followed this opinion, using Detlefsen (?) as a source.\n\nWho dat\n\nAnyone has an idea?\n\n&gt;Obviously, our ancestors warriors thus must've fought in the Dacian Wars against Trajan's Rome. Dacians, like Thracians, were close relatives to the Getae, and only named themselves Dacians a few centuries before Christ. In chronicles of the 11th century, Dacians and Getae are mentioned in numerous wars in Poland and outside it.\n\nBalts vs. Rome - the greatest rivalry of antiquity. Balts won, they destroyed Rome. \n\nWait a second... aren't Dacians and Getae kinda... the same tribe? Just that one is a Roman name and the other is a Greek name? Pretty sure that the Ancient Greeks only used \"Getae\" to refer to them. It would be a better theory than them suddenly deciding \"okay, we've been Getae, let's name ourselves with a different name from now on. Dacians! That'll confuse our enemies!\"\n\nAnd I have no idea where Matulis is taking that last bit from. Dacians as a nation were kinda destroyed by the Romans, and I'm pretty sure most of them had been assimilated into the Romanians by that time. Or whatever the predecessor to the Romanians were.\n\n&gt;7.\n\nThis theory talks about the Phrygians and shit.\n\n&gt;Basanavičius, while living in Bulgaria, took attention that the oldest Phrygian scriptures, location names and people names really resemble Lithuanian, so, according to him, Lithuanians are at least partially descending from Phrygians. One again, the relation between Phrygians, Getae, Dacians and Thracians is undisputed, and through them - with Lithuanians.\n\nffs, Basanavičius.\n\nBasanavičius isn't even a god damn historian. He studied medicine, he was a doctor. And a political activist campaigning for Lithuanian cultural rights in tsarist Russia, but still not a historian.\n\nSo stop using him.\n\nNow, Phrygian language. Nope, not close to Baltic at all. Their classification is not known, but some people put them as relatives of Greek.^[13] And how could they even get here, across an entire continent, when they migrated into a whole different direction, into god damn Asia Minor?\n\nOh, and that relation between Phrygians and your other names? Totally disputed, actually. In fact, most researchers don't even place these languages into a similar language group.\n\n&gt;8.\n\nThat was quick.\n\nThis paragraph talks about the Cimbri.\n\n&gt;According to Herodotus, in about 8th century BC a group called the Cimmerians (Cimbrians, Cimbri) moved out of their homeland in the northern coasts of the Black Sea.\n\nThis is true. And according to him and Assyrian sources, they overran Anatolia only to be destroyed, and that's the last we ever heard of them.^[14] Not related to Cimbri at all.\n\n&gt;They participated in the conquest of Rome, and Romans saw their large abandoned camps in modern day Denmark. Obviously, before settling in modern day Denmark, they must've passed Lithuania and Prussia.\n\nI'm not sure where he is getting that abandoned camps part, but it was common among Romans to believe that the Cimbri lived in Jutland, yes. Both Tacitus and Strabo wrote about that, but archaeological searches show no evidence of mass migrations in Jutland around that time.^[15]\n\nAnd the second part is complete bogus. Baltic territories aren't even in the way!\n\n&gt;In the 6th century, the island of Gotland was called Cimbria, from where Widewuto, kicked out by the Goths, landed on the shores of Prussia with 46 000 Cimbrians.\n\nThe first part is just blatant lies. Matulis might have been referring to Jutland, which is sometimes called the Cimbrian Peninsula, but still, bad geography AND bad history.\n\nAlso, not to burst your bubble, bro, but the legend of [Widewuto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widewuto) - totally fake. Made up by medieval German historians. You should know that by know. I know we're both Lithuanians and we should believe it's true, but this is not the 20th century anymore, we are not trying to prove that pagan Balts had a writing system here.\n\nUh, none of you get what I'm talking about?.. Basically, there was a legend created by Simon Grunau about a Germanic king named Widewuto and his brother Brutheni or something, who arrived to Prussia, settled there and gave the start to the Prussian civilization as we know it. [This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Flag_of_Widewuto.jpg/220px-Flag_of_Widewuto.jpg) was supposed to be his banner, with the three Prussian chief deities and strange symbols depicted, which were believed to be a pagan Baltic script. Lithuanian researchers believed in this legend for three centuries, but nowadays it's pretty much universally agreed to be falsified, much like the depiction of Baltic polytheism as an organized religion with a \"pagan Pope\" by Peter von Dursburg.\n\nNot to Matulis, of course.\n\n&gt;It's probable that the old name for Wales also comes from the Cimbri.\n\nNo. NO.\n\nOne etymology^[16] originates the name for Cimbri from PIE word *tḱim-ro-* \"inhabitant\" or from *tḱoi-m-* \"home\" (&gt; English home), itself a derivation from *tḱei-* \"live\". Meanwhile, \"Cymry\", the word Matulis is referring to, is derived from Brittonic *kombrogik, meaning “compatriots”.^[17] Despite the similarities, this is yet another Thracians-Trakai situation - correlation is not causation.\n\nOkay, enough of Cimbri, let's get to the next one...\n\n&gt;9.\n\nThis theory originates the Lithuanians from Romans.\n\nRemember that chart where Finland is depicted as the successor to the Roman Empire? Well we're here to take your spot, you fucks. You Estonian-loving fucks. Estonians are slow.\n\n&gt;Our modern day researchers still laugh at the old Roman origin theory.\n\nAnd for good reason.\n\nFor those who are not Lithuanian, the Roman origin theory comes all the way from the 16th century. At the time, Lithuanians wanted to prove that they are totally better than the Slavs they are in a personal union in and that they are no savages, so the Chronicles of Lithuania created a legend about a Roman duke called Palemon (of Pontus), relative of Nero, who escaped to Lithuania with 500 noble families on boat (how they actually got to the Baltic from Asia Minor in a single ship trip is left to the imagination of the reader) and were the ancestors to all Lithuanian nobles. Since we are Romans, we are better than all those Poles and Russians, right?\n\nEveryone jumped on that circlejerk for a few centuries before finally forgetting it. It was a weird teenage phase that we had, it happens.\n\n&gt;Many of them scratched their head, wondering who and when created this theory.\n\nBychowiec Chronicle, 16th century. I solved the mystery with a Google search!\n\n&gt;Like we always do, we'll try to prove that this theory is not made up, we just have to know how to read it. This theory is written last between the correct theories in this list, but it could also be placed on the false ones. Why?\n\n*drumrolling ensues*\n\n&gt;Previously mentioned Heruli \n\n*bass drop*\n\nWe went there! It's sexy Balt-on-Balt action, bros! Balts built Rome, Balts destroyed it!\n\n&gt;traveled on the borders of the Roman Empire for about a century, lived next to the Danube and in the Empire itself for a few decades, fought in it, some of them christianized and became literate. Why can't we call them Romans?\n\nI have no words.\n\nI have no words, my confirmed-to-be-Baltic brothers.\n\n&gt;The legend about the return of Heruli after the conquest of Rome in the oldest of times was obviously connected to Rome. So, whether the Lithuanian Roman origin theory is correct, is up to the reader.\n\nYou know, I'll stop here. The last four theories - Goths, Venedi, Gepids and Alans - are just repeats of the past. More Basanavičius, more Heruli, more Widewuto. So why bother?\n\nThank you for reading, I hope you learned about your Baltic origins today.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n\n1.  Alexander M.

She might be of darker complexion than your average English folks but that's not saying a lot. Shakespeare's Dark Lady has dark eyes and hair, but nothing was mentioned about her skin color (also people generally don't love themselves so much that they wrote books of love poems to themselves). \n\nSecondly, she published her own book of poetry *Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum* with some rather progressive feminist views. So the claim \"they won't publish her work because she was black\" was false. She did not die in poverty either, according to *The Bassanos* by David Lasocki and Roger Prior and *The poems of Shakespeare's dark lady: Salve Deus Re Judaeorum* by Alfred Rowse when she died she had a steady and regular income at the time of her death. \n\nShakespeare authorship is already a fringe theory, I doubt even the most hardcore Shakespeare conspiracy theorists would take Lanier theory seriously. \n\n\n",

Today I have the day off from work, and since I am cleaning, vacuuming and washing clothes, I thought it an excellent time to add another chore to the list and complete a documentary review. The title of this one is called Judgement Day at Marathon:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EYEeITctjg&amp;list=TL9IUtklmz66uJbkxHq-QK60_Mv3Xxc7bp\n\nAs I am blatantly pro-Iranian in my sympathies, I have an imaginary bottle of Persian wine called Mey. So let us view the heroic attempt by the Achaemenids to bring civilization to Ancient Greece!\n\n0.09: Ah, good to see the movie 300 has had such a positive effect on the study of history. ಠ_ಠ\n\n0.12: The \"Persian\" army here is using the wrong equipment, weapons and EVERYTHING ELSE! The costumes are completely incorrect, the shields would have either been the wicker *spara*, the violin-shaped *dipylon* or the crescent-shaped *pelta* used by skirmishers or light infantry. There are no bronze or iron scale and no bows. DRINK!\n\n0.25: Another incorrect Persian shield DRINK!\n\n0.36: The narrator states that Marathon was a battle for the supremacy of the ancient world. Except not really. Despite being defeated, the Achaemenid Empire was still a \"world power\" for another 150 years. DRINK!\n\n0.42: Annnnnnnd we have the scene where the Greeks kick a Persian emmisary into a well from 300. ಠ益ಠ \n\n0.44: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELDING AND SPINNING! DRINK!\n\n1.04: Oh. My. God. A dipylon! RELUCTANT PRAISE DRINK!\n\n1.15: HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELDING AND SPINNING! DRINK!\n\n1.35 MORE HOLLYWOOD DUAL WIELDING! DRINK!\n\n1.42: And now we have the Immortals. Now, the documentary does at least get one thing right in calling them heavy infantry, but there is doubt within academic circles if the Immortals actually existed as Herodotus described them. A very plausible theory is that their name in Persian was actually Anusiya (Companions) as opposed to Anusa (Immortals), and Herodotus merely confused their name. It is also likely that they were not elite guard units that popular culture portrays. The reason is that Herodotus already recorded the Achaemenid King of Kings as having an elite guard, the Apple-Bearers, as well as a 1000-strong unit of cavalry. The Immortals were probably a full time military force based around the capital that could quickly be deployed for campaigns. Also, Immortals were never recorded as being involved in the Battle of Marathon. DRINK!\n\n1.52: \"Six hundred Persian warships had set sail on the Aegean Sea and swallowed every Greek island in their path\". Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n2.03 – 3.40: WTF??? This was a section from a comletely different documentary just spliced in there!\n\n5.08: Typical, he chooses the Schoinias Beach. #STOPFATSHAMING! #ENDFULLFIGUREHATRED!\n\n8.16: MICHAEL BAY SLOW WALK!\n\n9.46: All the Athenians have the lambada symbol on them. Athenian shields would not have been so uniform in appearance, and it was the Spartans, not the Athenians, who decorated their shields in such a manner. DRINK!\n\n9.52: Another totally inaccurate Persian army. DRINK!\n\n9.59: I have no idea where the narrator gets the size of the army from. Herodotus does not provide the number of men in the Persian force, and other primary sources give the standard 100,000+ oriental horde amount. Although modern estimates are around 25,000, the exact proportion of different troops are not known. Also, given that it was the standard Persian tactic to fight with infantry equipped with spears and bows from behind a shield-wall, there would have been way more than 2000 archers. POORLY SOURCED CLAIM DRINK!\n\n10.17: Yet another totally inaccurate Persian army.

I find this difficult to believe as many Spartans could actually read.\n\n12.22: Okay, this formation marching scene is bad-ass.\n\n12.49: The academic here is listed as a 'distinguished professor'. Now I am thinking of other possible titles such as \"somewhat adequate professor\".\n\n14.28: The academic states the Greeks invented logic, mathematics and philosophy. That's a funny way of describing Babylon. DRINK!\n\n15.40: The academic states the whole cause of the conflict was Athens telling the Persians \"We are not allies anymore\" and Darius deciding to punish them. Not even Chomskius, the God of Misinformed and Deliberately Duplicitous Scholars, could be more wrong. It was the Athenians sending ships to assist the Ionian revolt against Persia which was the spark for the Greco-Persian Wars. Herodotus himself wrote:\n\n\"The Athenians then, I say, being persuaded, voted a resolution to despatch twenty ships to help the Ionians, and appointed to command them Melanthios one of their citizens, who was in all things highly reputed. These ships proved to be the beginning of evils for the Hellenes and the Barbarians\".\n\nThe scale of the mistake needs four drinks. DRINK! DRINK! DRINK DRINK!\n\n15.50: Lovely, another 300 reference. ヽ(｀Д´)ﾉ \n\n16.12: Another academic falsely stating it was the initial alliance between Athens and Persia which started the Greco-Persian Wars. DRINK!\n\n16.37: More Athenian warriors with Spartan shields. DRINK!\n\n18.04: The documentary is stating the Athenians positions themselves in a narrow  valley mouth to fight the Persians. Herodotus makes no mention of this. In fact, he specifically states that the Greeks thinned out their centre, both to equal the length of the Persian front and to reinforce their flanks. This communicates the site was the wide plain, not the valley entrance. DRINK!\n\n18.17: Yet more Athenian warriors with Spartan shields. DRINK!\n\nThat is all for today.

LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.” \n\nReplace a few keywords and you get something of an idea. Now I don't *just* hate him for being wrong, or for being an internet cult leader, or being so un-fucking-bearably smug and condescending, or for ignoring all other theories and arguments and just twisting history to fit his alt-right ideology, or for making his videos so fucking bloated that his thesis is diffused across hours of jerking himself off, but for *all of the above.* And now he's here again in all his faux-British accent glory to explain in a   *t w o     a n d      a      h a l f      h o u r* video how Rome fell, with a juicy snippet of the fun to come in the video description bearing:\n\n&gt; The fall of the Roman Empire closely mirrors the challenges currently facing Europe and North America – toxic multiculturalism, rampant immigration, runaway feminism, debt, currency corruption, wildly antagonistic politics\n\n\nW E W   L A D.\n\nNow I am using the thesis of Dr. Peter Heather to refute this (namely his book *The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History*) because it is the mainstream theory that I'm most familiar with. Unlike Stefan, I understand that there are other theories, such as Dr. Adrian Goldsworthy's, but I'm not too familiar with it (though I doubt Molyneux is either) so I'll be sticking to what I know. That aside, please join myself, Dr. Heather, and Dr. Vodka Tonic for another episode of Molyneux Mistakes.\n\n\n**10:30** Alright, after ten minutes of prep-work we run smack into the idea that the Roman Army had been 'Germanized.' Molyneux says that Rome was increasingly relying on Germanic barbarians to fill the gaps in its armies who maintained their own tribal loyalties and once the money ran out they turned on both Rome and each other. Here Molyneux also raises the boogeyman of multiculturalism. I take issue with this for two main reasons.\n\n- **None of this is new** Rome's army had been composed of large numbers of foreign auxiliaries for centuries, with up to 50% of it being made of such forces, the only thing that really changed was that non-citizens could be integrated into the legions proper instead of being in segregated auxiliary units. Roman discipline and training remained pretty much as brutal and effective as it had always been and there are no indicators that German-born soldiers were any less competent or loyal than Roman ones provided that they were paid on time. Same goes for the officers, Roman officers of German descent were no more treacherous or power-hungry than any other Roman officer -which doesn't say much to be honest. Roman troops and officers of any ethnic background continued to be a hardass, dangerous fighting force throughout the fall, with no more disloyalty/backstabbing than any other ambitious Roman usurpers exhibited in the Empires history.\n\n- **Multiculturalism was not a problem** Molyneux's claim here is just absurd because it ignores the past 4-5 centuries of Roman prominence (and of course the Eastern Empire, just like every other argument he makes). One of Rome's remarkable traits was its ability to Romanize the conquered population. Those wonderful Roman ruins we find spilled all over the Empires territory weren't all built by Roman colonists, but by local rulers who adopted Roman custom. They built like Romans, learned like Romans, dressed like Romans. Trier, a city on the Rhine frontier, was as thoroughly Roman as the haughtiest of senator could want, and by the 3rd century you could -and locals did- get high-quality *grammarian* and *rhetor* educations all over the Empire, producing people like St Augustine of Hippo. This wasn't just slapping a coat of Roman paint on a barbarian society, the existence of Roman schools, Roman constitutions for towns, Roman political structures emerging to take over local ones, and even mundane things like using grain for bread rather and porridge, reflect how deeply Romanized the provinces became as time passed.\n\n\n**19:00** He's trying to make a point that the Edict of Caracalla, in which everyone under Imperial rule gained Roman citizenship, weakened the Empire fundamentally because it diluted Roman identity -something he attributes to Roman success- among all these subjects who weren't Roman culturally... except they sort of were as I pointed out above. Rome rewarded provinces that adopted to Roman customs, and the elites were quite happy to oblige, which is why we find an elite Roman-bred blue blood like Quintus Aurelius Symmachus deferring to a *Gallic*-born teacher, Decimius Magnus Ausonius, as his superior in Latin language. Not only where the provinces quite Romanized for the most part, but they were so Romanized that they sometimes out-Romaned the Romans themselves. Molyneux's picture of a veneer of Romaness draped over seething un-Roman cultures shows off again how *little* research he does beyond dates and some economic footnotes.\n\nNote: It's nice that I can skip through chunks of this video given how much he repeats himself and otherwise rambles.\n\n\n**39:40** He now starts talking about the arrival of the Goths on the Danube in the winter of 375, and immediately misrepresents the intent of the Greuthungi and Tervingi refugees seeking admittance into the Empire. He basically (surprise!) contrasts them with the current refugee crisis in Europe and labels them as economic migrants who just wanted in on the spoils of Empire despite not having any desire to culturally integrate. I'd be about to mention the *hunndreds* of other problems that pushed the Goths into Rome, but strangely enough he brings it up right after, but not adjusting his initial judgement of them as economic migrants. \n\n\nHe spends the next ten minutes talking again about how Roman values built Rome and how extending citizenship destroyed it, and I really want to yell at him 'WHAT ABOUT THE EAST?' The Eastern Empire *thrived* while under the same 'multicultural plague' he bemoans. Does he ever mention what saved it? I don't know. Maybe the gold standard.\n\n\nI'll just mention that given his underlying premises are largely wrong I'm not going to repeat myself every time he talks about 'barbarian' soldiers or how the Empire was beset by multiculturalism. \n\n\nAround **1:10:00** we start moving into the Crisis of the Third Century, which according to Molyneux was instigated by the devaluation of the denarius, which did indeed see a massive drop in purity during the crisis to a point where there was scarcely any silver in it at all, causing depression and contributing to the general disaster of the Third Century. However he says the reason it was devalued was because Rome had to keep raising money to pay barbarian mercenaries because apparently the Roman Army was already gone by the early 2nd century, and he claims that Emperor Severus Alexander was killed by his 'barbarian' troops for not paying them a gold bonus. I don't know where this idea came from, Severus was [killed by his own soldiers](http://www.roman-empire.net/decline/alex-severus.html) because -after military humiliation by Sasanid Persia- his disgruntled soldiers felt that him trying to pay off unruly Alamanni was the last straw in a string of military embarrassments.\n\nHe goes on about how the Roman state continued to debase and devalue, contributing to the crisis, without addressing the driving cause behind all this. The rise of the Sassanid Dynasty in Persia created a superpower on the Eastern border that completely upset the Roman Empire, especially after a string of military disaster that included the capture and execution of two Emperors, Valerius and Numerianus. The Empire found itself scrambling to juice up the army by nearly a third, and all of the debasing and whatnot were prompted by a sudden need to pay for a gargantuan military upsizing.\n\n**1:24:00** He brings up the lauded 'flight of the curials' as an example of the oppressive Roman state crushing the free-market self-governing principals that made Rome as successful as it was, the curials (*decurions*) being the land-owners wealthy enough to run for town council and usually the source of most public works, building baths, aqueducts, toilet blocks, etc, to gain local power and recognition by the higher-ups, with the hope of winning local elections to control local funds. The 3rd Century Crisis however put an end to the party as the state began taking these funds in order to fund the growing army, with a noted drop of the *curials* from town council positions, and a decline in privately-funded monuments in favor of state-sponsored ones.\n\n\nWhat Molyneux doesn't take note of however is the rise of the expanding Imperial bureaucracy, the *Honorati* who were being given basically all the tasks that town councils used to do, such as usage of the towns tax allocation. This lead to the *curials* lobbying and fighting for the *honorati* positions, and soon enough the *honorati* behaved very much like the self-elected town council positions of before. So the wealthy land-owning class, on whom local society's wheels turned, carried on pretty much the same as ever and didn't withdraw from society as Molyneux claims. Honestly, this stuff is all in the books his source listing claims he read.\n\n\n**1:27:30** He begins claiming that the state started subsidizing the poor and heavily taxing the rich, leading to an *Idiocracy*-like decline in intelligent people and a rise in unintelligent ones. I... I don't know where this idea comes from. Not only did rich Romans continue to be rich Romans throughout late antiquity, but the state was not in anyway subsidizing the poor. The only subsidizations that I know of were the time-honored corn dolls in Rome itself.\n\n\nNow he goes on with this sort of thing for most of the remaining video, going on about heavier tax burdens on the poor, the tying of peasants to their profession and land initiated by Diocletian, basically asserting that Rome taxed itself to death until it couldn't afford to effectively run the Empire. \n\n\nHowever, more recent archaeological discoveries challenge this notion. Starting in the 1950s with sites uncovered by French archaeologist d Georges Tchalenko near Antioch, a new picture of Roman late antiquity as arisen that shows prosperity and high populations across the Empire. Specifically, Tchalenko discovered villages in Syria that became prosperous in the third and fourth centuries from producing olive oil, with their prosperity continuing into the seventh century. Further field surveys across the Empire reinforced this view, to quote from Heather's *A New History:*\n\n\n&gt; *Broadly speaking, these surveys have confirmed that Tchalenko’s Syrian villages\nwere a far from unique example of late Roman rural prosperity. The central provinces of Roman\nNorth Africa (in particular Numidia, Byzacena and Proconsularis) saw a similar intensification of\nrural settlement and production at this time. This has been illuminated by separate surveys in Tunisia\nand southern Libya, where prosperity did not even begin to fall away until the fifth century. Surveys in\nGreece have produced a comparable picture. And elsewhere in the Near East, the fourth and fifth\ncenturies have emerged as a period of maximum rural development – not minimum, as the orthodoxy\nwould have led us to expect. Investigations in the Negev Desert region of modern Israel have shown\nthat farming also flourished in this deeply marginal environment under the fourth-century Empire. The\npattern is broadly similar in Spain and southern Gaul, while recent re-evaluations of rural settlement\nin Roman Britain have suggested that its fourth-century population reached levels that would only be\nseen again in the fourteenth*\n\n\nThe only parts of the Empire that seem to have not shared the above prosperity were in *Gallica Belgia, Germania Inferior,* and Italy itself. Likely explanations for the former two would be the heavy raiding they experienced during the 3rd Century Crisis, during which Italy lost it's special tax privileges leading to a drop in prosperity there as well.\n\nHeather argues also that the Diocletian-initiated shift to taxing communities in material goods did not have the devastating effects that have been claimed. Tenant subsistence farmers tend only to grow as much as they need to pay the taxes and feed themselves, so unless you raise the tax to the point of peasants starving or their land becoming over-farmed, you're not going to see any economic disaster since the farmers will just work more to meet the new quota, and certainly we don't have any examples of mass starvation occurring in late antiquity.\n\n\nNot to say it was all sunshine and rainbows for Roman peasants, you were having to work harder to meet higher tax demands and -at least in the more densely populated centers- you were forbidden from moving around in search of better tenancy terms.\n\n\nNow we're finally reaching near the end of this video. He repeats talking points of barbarized armies, the dangerous of multiculturalism, how Rome was taxed dry by the time of the Gothic incursions, etc. He portrays everything after the Battle of Hadrianople as basically being a long, inevitable slide towards collapse. This is entirely simplistic, Western Rome experiences climbs and falls before it finally ended for good, and while towards the very end it became increasingly reliant on deals with Gothic rulers to make up for its inability to pay for large armies (thanks to the Vandals taking the breadbasket for North Africa) He completely ignores how men like Flavius Aetius made the Roman military a serious force to be reckoned with when Molyneux suggests it was nothing but a rabble of German mercenaries. \n\n\n**27:19:00** Ah, and here's the long-awaited mention of feminism. He starts of saying that 'the influence of women has long been associated with national decline.' Like how America's fall from power *directly* coincides with women's suffrage, for example. He then allegedly quotes an late antiquity Roman complaint, saying that 'while Rome ruled the world, women rule Rome', a quote I cannot find sources for. Not to mention that none of my readings even mention women having some fatal influence in Roman power, so I really don't know what he's talking about. \n\n\nAnd with that, we're about done. Stefan drones on about, reiterating his talking points until the video ends. So in summary, what does he say caused Roman collapse?\n\n\n- Multiculturalism. Nonsense, given the widespread Romanization throughout the Empire, the prevalence of Roman education, Roman customs, Roman law, all pervading the highest levels of society across the Empire. Also, the Eastern Empire did great.\n\n\n- Crushing economic policies that destroyed Rome's 'middle class' (an anachronism if ever I've heard one) and impoverished the Empire. More nonsense, archaeological findings show that the later Empire was doing quite well overall, the peasants managed the increased tax burden and the *curials* transitioned into *honorati* and carried on just as they always had -admittedly at the expense of more distant towns in favor of regional capitals- and of course, the Eastern Empire did just fine.\n\n\n- A barbarized army that was undependable. Further nonsense, Roman armies in the 4th and 5th centuries continued to be pretty kickass, under Aetius they reconquered a lot of Roman territory, beat the Hunns, etc. German-hired Roman soldiers/officers weren't anymore disloyal than their Roman bred counterparts, and it was only after the loss of North Africa to the Vandals that the West *really* couldn't afford to field proper armies anymore. And once again, *the Eastern Empire did just fine.*\n\n\nAnd he never once addresses how the East not only survived the West, but thrived and prospered for centuries afterward. All of the factors he attributes to destroying the West were had in the East, minus one factor that Heather believes was the main factor in the West's fall. The push of Germanic tribes into Roman territory by the Hunns. Goths, Vandals, Burgundians, etc, the Roman army was ultimately unable to keep up with the steady stream of barbarian invaders -invaders who had over the centuries of Roman conflict evolved into an increasingly potent threat- and as each ravaged province diminished the states ability to fund soldiers, it finally collapsed.\n\n\nIn the end, it's another Molyneux history video. Nothing bad ever happens that can't be blamed on centralized government, multiculturalism, or feminism. Of all the sources he has listed I suspect the only one he ever read was Gibbons work, and he represents an ideologically-driven slant that isn't supported by any credible scholars in the field. \n\nAnd with that I'm done. I hope I maintained coherency towards the end, spending three hours sitting in a chair going through Molyneux's content is a pretty crippling process, and I polished off my vodka while at it. Let's never do this again, shall we? Hear that Stefan? No more history videos now, you scoundrel!\n\n\n**R5** *The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History* by Dr. Peter Heather\n\n\nAnd a great post/thread [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4oelte/how_accurate_is_the_popular_view_that/d4ffhvm?st=it9ti3n1&amp;sh=2a007442) about the differing theories on the subject, what happened in the end, and the effect of immigration on the Empire.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/53eugh/the_history_of_early_biblical_interpretation_as_a/",
        "text": "I had originally starting writing this for specifically for /r/badhistory, though in the course of writing it I decided to make it into a blog post; and now I'm editing the blog version again for this subreddit, removing a few things that probably aren't best suited for this sub. Hope it comes out alright. \n\n____\n\nAbove all, this post is kind of a distilled version of some persistent, questionable historical claims that I've seen nearly weekly over at /r/Christianity, my main stomping grounds, for years now -- though it certainly comes to /r/Christianity itself by way of a broader kind of discourse; and as I discuss a little later, some of these claims and misunderstandings have even infiltrated academia, if only at some of the \"lower\" levels here.\n\nAlthough I think it's safe on this subreddit, at this point I could hardly be more pessimistic about the prospects of reasonably discussing this among certain other groups. Hopefully without being too vague, I'm almost convinced that even just *descriptive* accounts of the relevant history here are often seen as an implicit attack on cherished values.\n\nAs I get at a bit more in the [blog version](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/atheology/2016/09/the-history-of-early-biblical-interpretation-as-a-weapon-and-a-shield/) of this, one of the reasons that this topic -- literal vs. non-literal interpretation of the Bible (especially the book of Genesis) in the early centuries of the Common Era -- can be controversial is because most people come to it by way of the ever-contentious debates on how to interpret the Bible *here in the 21st century*.\n\nIn these debates, the history of early Biblical interpretation is treated kind of like rhetorical currency -- or, in more keeping with my title, rhetorical *ammunition* -- used variously to legitimize, deny, or insult in-group or out-group positions, and sides having been delineated based on their (supposed) conformity or non-conformity with the past. \n\n____\n\nAs suggested, the main starting point of contention for most people who are really invested in this issue is *what's the correct interpretation of Bible?*. As for the Christian dimension of this debate -- and to frame things in dualistic terms -- the two differing sides here are often considered to be that of (Protestant) fundamentalism at one end, vs. those variously characterized as \"mainstream\" or \"progressive\" on the other. And often it's particularly the issue of *evolution* that's constitutes the dividing line here, vis-a-vis interpretation of the book of Genesis -- in which, naturally, the creation of the world and humans is recounted.\n\nNow, the issue of the relative merits of the different arguments here falls into firmly theological territory. (The blog version of this post also mostly admitted them, though went into a bit more detail explicating these positions and implications, etc.) \n\nFrom a scientific point of view, the issue of the legitimacy of evolution, of course, does not. \n\nFor the \"mainstream\" or \"progressive\" camp that finds harmony between Christian faith and evolution, then, one of the main ways that this is secured is through the idea that Christianity *isn't beholden to a woodenly literal interpretation of the Bible* (again, in particular, the book of Genesis).\n\nBut my own point of departure  -- the one that justifies this post's presence on /r/badhistory -- has to do with when defenders of this (and they can be found among both Christians and non-Christians) go further in their support of this, for example suggesting that the Bible had *never* previously been interpreted \"literally\" in some of the ways that it has been in more recent times—not until the emergence of this aberrant strain of Protestant fundamentalism sometime around the late 19th century, that is, as it's claimed.\n\nAnd to be sure, there are obviously respects in which particular pseudoscientific defenses of, say, [Young Earth creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism) simply could not have existed prior to the past century or so; if only because the scientific methodologies and discourses that these defenses rely on—however perversely they do so—didn't exist before this. (Even here though, I think we have to be very cautious in how we characterize this, as we can certainly find precedent for pseudoscientific 20th century Young Earth creationism in the \"flood geology\" of the centuries prior to this. I have a bibliography of academic works on this and related issues [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Theologia/comments/3pk2mg/test/cyyqypr).)\n\nNevertheless, the much broader statement \"the Bible wasn't interpreted literally in antiquity\" is exactly the form of the claim that I see quite often; or at least something quite like this. And it's also frequently accompanied by mention of two ancient Christian interpreters in particular who are thought to have embodied this approach: the third century Alexandrian theologian [Origen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen), and the inimitable fourth/fifth century bishop, theologian, and saint Augustine.\n\nAnd it's with this that I want to take my starting point, in addressing a constellation of historical misunderstandings that seem to have cropped up around this issue. \n\n___\n\nFor maximum ease, I'm just going to proceed in bullet-point here, making a few major points—or suggestions as to how these historical (mis)understandings might be rectified or avoided—followed by some more detailed observations/analysis on these things.\n\n____\n\nTo start out here,\n\n- **No one in antiquity interpreted the entire Bible either literally or non-literally**. (And not even the most adamant of proclaimed or supposed contemporary literalists do so either, for that matter.)\n\nOf course, a look at the writings of the first century Alexandrian Jewish interpreter [Philo of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo) might give the impression that there's little in the Bible that he *didn't* interpret non-literally/allegorically. On the other hand, On the other hand, there are those who expressed a marked preference for the literal, as the fourth century bishop and theologian Basil of Caesarea does, strikingly, in one of his later writings: \"[There are] those who do not admit the common meaning of the Scriptures . . . [But] when I hear ‘grass,’ I think of grass, and in the same manner I understand everything as it is said, a plant, a fish, a wild animal, and an ox. ‘Indeed, I am not ashamed of the gospel’\" (*Homiliae in Hexaemeron* 9.1).³\n\nFurther—as I'll discuss more below—in contrast to his earlier inclinations, in Augustine's most well-known commentary on Genesis (*De Genesi ad Litteram*), he seeks to interpret it \"literally\" as far as possible.\n\nBut when we really look at things closely here, we find all sorts of exceptions and have to come up with a lot of caveats. \n\nPerhaps above all, there are certain ambiguities as to what exactly it means to rely on the literal sense of the text to begin with.⁴ David Dawson, in his monograph on early Hellenistic Jewish interpretation of the Bible and its Greek precedents, suggests of Philo of Alexandria that his \"devotion to the literal text was every bit as serious as that of the antiallegorical Alexandrian grammarians\" (*Allegorical Readers and Cultural Revision in Ancient Alexandria*, 72). At the same time though, he notes that \n\n&gt;Like both classical allegorists and Alexandrian philologists, Alexandrian Jews sought to refute inappropriate or unfit readings. [Aristobulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristobulus_of_Alexandria) is distressed by \"those devoted to the letter alone\" . . . whose readings reflect a \"fictional and anthropomorphic [*mythodes kai anthrōpinon*] way of thinking about God\" (Praep. evang. 8.10.2) common to those without \"insight and understanding\" . . . Such readings are inappropriate because they discover nothing \"elevated\" (megaleion— i.e., \"fitting\") about God (*Praep. evang*. 8.10.5). Aristobulus exhorts his readers instead “to receive the interpretations according to the laws of nature . . . and to grasp the conception of God that agrees with them [*hē harmozousa ennoia peri theou*]\" (*Allegorical Readers*, 77)\n\nAs suggested, similar ancient approaches are in fact taken up by proclaimed/supposed modern literalists as well. For example, addressing the Biblical texts which appear to assume a cosmology of an immobile earth supported by “pillars,” an article on the Answers in Genesis site [explains](http://www.donotlink.com/gjcr) that the “supposed contradiction quickly disappears when we examine the context of each passage and recognize it as figurative language.” (This was, of course, one of the main issues of contention in the [Galileo affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair) too.)\n\nAncient Biblical interpreters often upheld the literal sense of the text—as, for example, furnishing us with the actual details of genuinely historical events—while *at the same time* also seeking to uncover a deeper teaching hidden \"underneath\" the superficial veneer of the plain words; or even a secondary *prophetic* sense here, etc. \n\nAs hinted at above though, there are times when literal and figurative interpretations were thought to be antithetical to each other. This was especially the case when the literal sense of the text was thought to cast its characters in a negative light, morally speaking; and so when unethical things were ascribed to characters for whom these traits were thought to be unfitting of them—like deities—the text was in need of alternate interpretation. This approach can in fact be traced as far back as the 6th century BCE, to the Homeric interpreter [Theagenes of Rhegium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theagenes_of_Rhegium). More importantly though, it's precisely in conjunction with this that Augustine gives us one his most \"systematic\" treatments of his interpretive approach to the Bible:\n\n&gt;We must first explain the way to discover whether an expression [in the Bible] is literal or figurative. Generally speaking, it is this: anything in the divine discourse that cannot be related either to good morals or to the true faith should be taken as figurative. . . . [God's speech in] Jeremiah's phrase \"Behold today I have established you over nations and kingdoms, to uproot and destroy, to lay waste and scatter\" is, without doubt, entirely figurative, and so must be related to the aim that I mentioned above. Matters which seem like wickedness to the unenlightened, whether just spoken or actually performed, whether attributed to God or to people whose holiness is commended to us, are entirely figurative. (*De Doctrina Christiana* 3.33, 41-42, translation by R. P. H. Green)\n\nInterestingly, in addition to his principle that an interpretive approach is to be determined along ethical lines, Augustine also mentions the principle of conformity with \"the true faith.\" This ties into a larger issue that I don't have room to get into fully here; though it's important to note that elsewhere for Augustine (and to a large degree for Origen too⁵), it's the preservation of the accuracy and indeed the inerrancy of the Bible in general—not just an ethical inerrancy/impeccability, but one relating to its historical accuracy, etc., too—that largely motivates his interpretive decisions. \n\n- If someone's intention is to argue, for example, that a particular part of a particular book of the Bible doesn't have to be interpreted literally—and if they're going to appeal to past interpretation in support of that—then they should **make sure to specify that it was a particular part of a particular book of the Bible that wasn't taken literally. They certainly shouldn't argue the point with the generalizing statement \"the Bible wasn't interpreted literally\"; nor even, for example, \"[the book of Genesis wasn't taken literally](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/55c85n/opinion_of_apologetics/d89d5b2).\"**\n\nObviously, as part of this, when it comes to appealing to particular individuals like Origen and Augustine who are thought to have interpreted some particular Biblical thing non-literally, they should make sure that they have a good grasp on what exactly these figures had to say on this issue.\n\nAnd by the same token here, even specifying that \"[Origen and Augustine didn't interpret Genesis literally](https://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/55c85n/opinion_of_apologetics/d89d7pl) is woefully inaccurate. Bearing in mind the conjunction of \"literal\" and \"historical\" discussed above (and see again my **Note 4**), Panayiotis Tzamalikos writes that \"the proverbial 'denial of historicity' by Origen is a myth\" (*Origen: Philosophy of History &amp; Eschatology*, 370).\n\nIn fact, Origen seems to have also had a preference for the priority of the historical when it comes to the Biblical texts.⁶ And his philosophy here is no better expressed than by Origen himself (while at the same time also illustrating the principle of having to shift between the literal and the figurative when necessary):\n\n&gt;[it] is not that we should accept only what is found in the \"letter\"; for occasionally the records taken in a literal sense are not true, but actually absurd and impossible; and even with the history that actually happened and the legislation that's useful in its literal sense, there are other matters interwoven.\n\n. . .\n\n&gt;We must assert . . . that in regard to some things we are clearly aware that the historical fact is true; as that Abraham was buried in the double cave at Hebron, together with Isaac and Jacob and one wife of each of them; and that Shechem was given as a portion to Joseph; and that Jerusalem is the chief city of Judaea, in which a temple of God was built by Solomon; and thousands of other facts. Indeed the passages which are historically true are far more numerous than those which are composed with purely spiritual meanings. (*De Principiis* 4.3.4, translation Butterworth, only slightly modified for clarity)⁷\n\nAnd relevant to the compatibility of Christianity and evolution, with which this post began—particularly in terms of the issues of anthropology and the book of Genesis that are still highly disputed—both Origin and Augustine certainly assumed a literal/historical individual Adam as the progenitor of humanity. C. P. Bammel, surveying the corpus of Origen to discern his views on Adam, writes that\n\n&gt;Origen did regard Adam as a historical figure, as the first man and the ancestor of the human race. [For Origen] The story of the garden of Eden and the fall does include details which cannot be taken literally even on the narrative level, but it none the less really happened, while at the same time, like other Old Testament stories, pointing to hidden mysteries and containing deeper levels of meaning as well. (\"Adam in Origen\" in Williams, *The Making of Orthodoxy: Essays in Honour of Henry Chadwick*, 63)\n\nFurther, both Origen and Augustine defended the historicity of the Genesis flood narrative and even the feasibility of the ark of Noah being able to carry all animals, etc. (texts quoted in full quoted [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/bad_religion/comments/2psvu8/meta_question_is_this_sub_only_for_instances/cn0m50t)). And similar to Origen's suggestion that the number of genuinely historical events and details in the Biblical texts far outnumber figurative passages, it might also be noted here that Augustine—in his commentary aptly titled On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis—writes that\n\n&gt;The narrative in [Genesis] is not written in a literary style proper to allegory, as in the Song of Songs, but from beginning to end in a style proper to history, as in the Books of Kings and the other works of that type (*De Gen. ad litt*. 8.1.2)\n\nMoving on,\n\n- **There are some prominent misconceptions as to how ancient interpreters approached the cosmogony of the first chapter of the book of Genesis—particularly the six days of creation.**\n\nI've mentioned that it's certainly true that Origen and Augustine shifted to figurative interpretations in order to resolve various difficulties in the Biblical texts; and, again, throughout this post I've also mentioned the impetus to reconcile Christianity with the natural world and the facts of biological evolution, etc.\n\nOne of the most common strategies for reconciliation here has to do with an interpretation—one that's regularly thought to have pedigree in ancient interpretation⁸—in which the six \"days\" of world creation in the first chapter of Genesis are understood not as actual solar days, but as longer periods of time; and it's thought that this can be more easily harmonized with the time-scale of modern cosmology and evolution. This is known as the \"day-age\" interpretation, and relies on the idea that the Hebrew word normally translated as \"day\" actually has a broader semantic range in relation to time, and in Genesis 1 can be more accurately translated as something like \"*age*/eon.\"\n\nStrictly speaking, however, this claim can't be sustained on philological grounds⁹; though more importantly for my particular purposes here, this doesn't seem to have been an interpretation that was put forth in antiquity in the first place. To be sure, there's a somewhat related claim that was very frequently made by early interpreters, particularly in a [millenarianist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenarianism) eschatology, relating to the six days of the Genesis creation account bearing some relationship to the sum-total of the \"ages\" of world time. But here, the idea that the days of Genesis 1 were normal solar days wasn't disputed. Rather, this was a perfect example of the coexistence of literal and figurative interpretations—where these six days were thought to have also had a secondary prophetic sense in which they were also taken to *represent* millennia of world time subsequent to the creation days themselves. (Perhaps a single exception to this is found in the interpretation of the third century Carthaginian interpreters Cyprian, though actually it's uncertain what exactly Cyprian was really suggesting here. I've discussed this in much more detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/416pfs/what_were_some_mainstream_interpretations_of_the/cz0pzrx).)\n\nYet despite the fact that they didn't speak toward the day-age interpretation, Origen and Augustine—and before them, Philo of Alexandria—did have something to say about the creation days in Genesis 1, and what these might signify.\n\nWhat Philo had to say on the subject is less relevant for my purposes (though a starting point for this can found [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/UnusedSubforMe/comments/4jjdk2/test/d52tifl)). Attested commentary by Origen on this is scanty. However, in his Commentary on Matthew (on 14.9)—presumably in reference to Exodus 20:11, a clear reference back to the six creation days of Genesis 1—Origen suggests\n\nFor even if these things seem to have been made in six days, intelligence is required to understand in what sense the words “in six days” are meant because of this saying \n\nFrom other attested comments of his, it's been suggested that in his understanding of the creation days in Genesis 1, Origen \n\n&gt;[follows] the thinking of Philo, and of the Middle Platonists who said that Plato's description of an apparently temporal creation was made for the sake of \"clarity of instruction.\" In the same way, Origen says that \"everything was made at once . . . but for the sake of clarity a list of days and their events was given.\" The story of creation, in other words, refers to one simultaneous act, but was presented in sequential form to enable us to imagine the process. (Robert Daly, *Origeniana Quinta*, 257)¹⁰\n\nThere are some uncertainties on this, however: see my **Note 10**.\n\nBe that as that may though, Augustine certainly elaborates on the creation days in far more detail than in our attested fragments of Origen.\n\nFollowing Philo and Origen closely here (and again, as a reflection of the principle of Origen and others mentioned above, that \"occasionally the records taken in a literal sense are not true, but actually absurd and impossible\"), Augustine concludes that because the sun isn't created until the fourth \"day\" in the Genesis account—and yet because, as everyone knows, the rising and setting of the sun are *precisely what determines day and night in the first place*—then the \"days\" here could not have been meant in the sense that they're normally meant. Similarly, when all the days are described as also having a \"morning and evening\"—Genesis 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, and 31—this is also not what typically meant by these things either.\n\nOne of the things that points toward a way out of the conundrum for Augustine is the fact that the *second* creation account, beginning at Genesis 2:4f., starts out with a reference back to the events of the first creation account (1:1-2:3); and yet here, it appears to refer to this creation as having taken place on just a single day: \"In *the day* that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens...\" Since, for Augustine, this reinforces the appealing idea of the *simultaneity* of creation, Augustine then tries to discern what these six (apparent) days of creation from Genesis 1 might actually signify in relation to this.\n\n(Ironically, modern scholars now conclude that the phrase \"in the day [that]\" in Genesis 2:4's \"in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens\" is simply idiomatic for \"at the time,\" or simply \"when,\" and that it almost certainly isn't to be interpreted more literally in the way Augustine that took it. And on the other side of the coin, although Augustine and others seek to avoid the contradiction here by avoiding the literal sense of \"day/days,\" that the original author really was thinking of 24-hour days here is precisely what modern scholars suggest.¹¹)\n\nIn any case, in a sort of Platonically tinged interpretation intended to remove/bypass the same difficulty that Philo and Origen recognized—because again, Augustine notes that we know that days \"have a morning *because* the sun rises and an evening because the sun sets\" (City of God 11.7)—for Augustine the account in Genesis 1 here isn't really about the actual process of creation itself at all, but instead says something about the ideal *contemplation* of the world and its creator.\n\nIn short, Augustine proposes that the account is really about the intellectual transition from considering the world and all the things within it merely in themselves—a type of contemplation which he describes as \"dim\"—to contemplating them as a creation of God and his wisdom. \n\nPutting it all together then, he explains the presence of \"evening\" and \"morning\" in the Genesis account here in the sense that \"evening twilight turns into morning *as soon as knowledge turns to the praise and love of its Creator*\"; and so, whenever this sort of praise is done specifically in the light of knowledge of the various things in the Genesis account that were created on each of the six days, this is what a \"day\" and its passing was really intended to signify: for example, when this praise is given \"in the knowledge of the firmament—the heavens between the waters above and the waters below—this is the second day. . . . in the knowledge of all the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, this is the fifth day,\" etc.¹²\n\nFinally,\n\n- **Sometimes a [more general claim](https://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/52t0na/why_did_jesus_not_entrust_his_mother_to_james_or/d7n3mt6) is made that suggests that, whatever the case may be, Origen and Augustine either allow for or even presume the great antiquity of the world—of a kind that could be more compatible with modern estimates of this**.\n\nAgain, without getting too far away from my descriptive mission here, I think we can probably all agree that there's good reason to be hesitant of Augustine's convoluted interpretation of the creation days of Genesis 1 and whether this was ever intended by the author. Of course, in my experience I don't think people are very aware of his interpretation in the first place. Nevertheless, perhaps as part of what's thought to be Origen and Augustine's more general program of openness to figurative interpretation, and their openness to harmonizing Biblical texts and their interpretation with the facts of the natural world, it's sometimes thought that these figures either implicitly or perhaps even explicitly supported (or would have supported) the age of the world.\n\nNow, the issue of what Origen and Augustine would have thought about this, *had they lived in the 20th or 21st century*, is obviously complicated by the ambiguities and uncertainties of any other similar hypothetical. (For example, in this hypothetical, are Origen and Augustine brought to the 20th/21st century as they were, and merely asked to opine on the issue based *solely on the principles that they had delineated in their own original floruit*? Or are we talking about sort of \"updated\" versions of Origen and Augustine, where they were not only given our updated knowledge about the natural world, but are allowed to have reformulated their philosophies along with this?)\n\n____\n\n[I've removed a long excursus here that I'm going to post elsewhere.]\n___\n\nLeaving aside hypotheticals though, as for the claim that they presumed the substantial antiquity of the world, this is true for neither Origen nor Augustine, nor any other Jew or Christian in antiquity for that matter. In fact, both Origen and Augustine explicitly challenged this idea, especially in relation to the existence of contemporary \"secular\" histories that conflicted with what appeared to be the solid Biblical chronology—one which was interpreted to allow for (far) less than 10,000 years from the creation of the world to their own times. \n\nOn Origen's denial of an old world and/or affirmation of a young world, cf. his *Contra Celsum* 1.19-20; *Comm. Matt*. 24.14f. (quoted here); and for Augustine, cf. *City of God* 12.11ff.; 18.40; 20.7; Epistle 199.18; and probably implicitly in *De Gen. ad. Litt*. 9.11.19 (quoted here). For numerous other citations of early Jews and Christians on this issue, see my post [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1pjt7a/how_much_fallibility_are_you_willing_to_accept/).\n\n____\n\nWe could, of course, debate the theological ramifications of all these things. But that's not the intention of my post here. \n\nWe should also be careful in interpreting as malice what could simply be the product of carelessness—or, as it were, ignorance. But even if the skewed historiography of early Biblical interpretation (though again, in many instances this is just a kind of popular-level or folk historiography, and not so much an academic one¹³) is inadvertent, it nonetheless contributes to a sort of whitewashing of history in favor of modern ideologies of science-faith harmony, or general criticism-faith harmony—which can certainly be uncritically ideologically or theologically motivated.¹⁴\n\nAnd perhaps this is akin to accusations of apologetics in the historiography of the Galileo affair. (As a particular highlight in this controversy, refer to the issue of Vatican authorities tampering with the publication of Pio Paschini's *Vita e Opere di Galileo Galilei*. On this see Maurice Finocchiaro's *Retrying Galileo, 1633–1992*; and this is also discussed in shorter form in an appendix in Richard Blackwell's \"Could there be another Galileo case?\")\n\nTo the extent that this (mostly) folk historiography of early Biblical interpretations also sidesteps the possible negative *implications* of the long ecclesiastical history of what we might call uncritical interpretation—of the kind that Origen and Augustine were engaged in, in their wide-ranging acceptance of the historicity of Biblical narratives and their details, where modern scholars challenge some of these—we might also think of this as an apologetic maneuver. But this is clearly an issue that lies outside the bounds of history and historiography, and is firmly in the realm of the theological.\n\n⁂       ⁂       ⁂\n\n______\n\n**Notes**\n\n(Notes 1 and 2 omitted because of changed/abridged intro.)\n\n[**3**] Translation by David DeMarco, brackets mine. The Greek text of this reads\n\n&gt;Ἃς οἱ μὴ καταδεχόμενοι τὰς κοινὰς τῶν γεγραμμένων ἐννοίας . . . Ἐγὼ δὲ χόρτον ἀκούσας, χόρτον νοῶ, καὶ φυτόν, καὶ ἰχθὺν, καὶ θηρίον, καὶ κτῆνος, πάντα ὡς εἴρηται οὕτως ἐκδέχομαι\n\nAs for Basil's approach here—particularly in his commentary on Genesis—DeMarco writes that\n\n&gt;I will say in passing that I have become skeptical of attempts to explain away Basil’s later rejection of allegory by mention of the fact that his audience for the *Homiliae in hexaemeron* had uneducated members or by means of his earlier writings where he employs allegorical techniques. Gregory clearly felt the need to avoid allegory [in his *In  hexaemeron*], and it seems primarily due to Basil, though I am not prepared to rule out other personalities such as Diodore of Tarsus. It is of course also possible that Basil was giving way to perceived pressures, or that he felt Genesis in particular should not be subjected to allegory, while other texts still could be. Certainty is not possible here, but his strong language in the ninth homily seems to me to point to a developed conviction against allegory, though this not the prevailing opinion at the moment. Basil’s change from a Homoiousian position to a neo-Nicene position seems to me to also entail a move away from what was characterized as Origenistic theology in some respects... (\"The Presentation and Reception of Basil’s *Homiliae in hexaemeron* in Gregory’s In *hexaemeron*,\" 350-51)\n\n[**4**] There's some ambiguity about what exactly it means to interpret the Bible \"literally\" (or non-literally) in the first place. Sometimes this was no more clear in antiquity than it is in modernity. Without getting into too much depth on this, in her *After Eden: Church Fathers And Rabbis on Genesis 3:16-21* Hanneke Reuling, commenting on what an interpretation that was *ad litteram*, \"literal,\" entailed (particularly in relation to Augustine), writes\n\n&gt;The definition of what constitutes an interpretation *ad litteram* may vary in different contexts, alternatively referring to the historical facts narrated, the conventional meaning of words or to the \"true\" meaning of a word (as in the case of the first chapter of Genesis), but it always indicates the one side in a bipolar system of interpretation, in which 'literal', 'corporeal' or 'proper' (*proprie*) interpretation is opposed to 'prophetic', 'spiritual' or 'figurative' interpretation. (*After Eden*, 189)\n\nKenneth Howell, in his essay \"Natural Knowledge And Textual Meaning In Augustine's Interpretation Of Genesis: The Three Functions Of Natural Philosophy,\" notes that in his *Retractions*, Augustine 'explained that ad litteram was not “according to allegorical significations” (*non secundum allegoricas significationes*) but dealt with the actual events recorded (*secundum rerum gestarum proprietatem*)' (126).\n\n[**5**] More on Origen's view on Biblical inspiration [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/UnusedSubforMe/comments/4jjdk2/test/d7r6ihj).\n\n[**6**] Origen's affirmation of the historicity of the majority of Old Testament events was recognized not long after the time of Origen himself (and particularly in defense of him)—for example by the late 3rd/early 4th century presbyter Pamphilus of Caesarea. Thomas Scheck, on his monograph *Erasmus's Life of Origen*, writes\n\n&gt;in his *Apology for Origen*, [Pamphilus] demonstrates from indisputably authentic texts that Origen defends God's direct creation of the first man, Adam, and of Eve from one of Adam's ribs; he accepts the literal truth of Enoch's translation to heaven, Noah's flood and the Ark, the Tower of Babel, Abraham's hospitality to angels, Abraham's [*sic*: Lot's] wife changed into a pillar of salt, the ten plagues of Egypt, the passage through the Jordan, the rock struck by Moses, Joshua's making the sun stand still in the sky, the stories of Balaam, Gideon, and Deborah, Elijah's assumption into heaven, the resuscitation of the son of the Shunamite woman, the backward movement of the shadow under Hezekiah, and the historicity of Daniel, Judith, and Esther. A multitude of Origenian texts confirm that in the overwhelming majority of instances, Origen believed in the historicity of the literal accounts of scripture. (*Erasmus's Life of Origen*, 54-55)\n\n[**7**] The Greek text of this reads\n\n&gt;ἐστιν οὐχὶ τὰ ὑπὸ τῆς λέξεως παριστάμενα μόνα ἐκλαμβάνειν, ἐνίοτε τούτων ὅσον ἐπὶ τῷ ῥητῷ οὐκ ἀληθῶν ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀλόγων καὶ ἀδυνάτων τυγχανόντων, καὶ ὅτι προσύφανταί τινα τῇ γενομένῃ ἱστορίᾳ καὶ τῇ κατὰ τὸ ῥητὸν χρησίμῳ νομοθεσίᾳ.\n\n. . .\n\n&gt;λεκτέον ὅτι σαφῶς ἡμῖν παρίσταται περί τινων τὸ τῆς ἱστορίας εἶναι ἀληθές, ὡς ὅτι Ἀβραὰμ ἐν τῷ διπλῷ σπηλαίῳ ἐτάφη ἐν Χεβρὼν καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακὼβ καὶ ἑκάστου τούτων μία γυνή, καὶ ὅτι Σίκιμα μερὶς δέδοται τῷ Ἰωσήφ, καὶ Ἰερουσαλὴμ μητρόπολίς ἐστι τῆς Ἰουδαίας, ἐν ᾗ ᾠκοδόμητο ὑπὸ Σολομῶντος ναὸς θεοῦ, καὶ ἄλλα μυρία. πολλῷ γὰρ πλείονά ἐστι τὰ κατὰ τὴν ἱστορίαν ἀληθευόμενα τῶν προσυφανθέντων γυμνῶν πνευματικῶν.\n\n[**8**] [Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/416pfs/what_were_some_mainstream_interpretations_of_the/cz023cl)'s an example of a typical claim along these lines, in conjunction with a more general \"The 'literal creation story' interpretation used to be fringe between early Biblical scholars.\"\n\n[**9**] See my post [here](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/atheology/2015/12/but-if-you-look-at-the-original-greek-a-plea-for-caution/) for more. Just to highlight one thing from this, Biblical scholar John Walton, who's one of the leading world experts on the subject of the Genesis creation narratives in their ancient context,  writes that\n\nThese are seven twenty-four-hour days. This has always been the best reading of the Hebrew text. Those who have tried to alleviate the tension for the age of the earth commonly suggested that the days should be understood as long eras (the day-age view). This has has never been convincing. (*The Lost World of Genesis One: Ancient Cosmology and the Origins Debate*, 91)\n\n[**10**] The full context of the Greek of the Origen quote here is\n\n&gt;Καὶ συνετέλεσεν ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ ἂ ἐποίησεν. Ἤδη τινὲς ἄτοπον ὑπολαμβάνοντες τὸν Θεὸν δίκην οἰκοδόμου μὴ διαρ κέσαντος χωρὶς ἡμερῶν πλειόνων πληρῶσαι τὴν οἰ κοδομὴν, ἐν πλείοσιν ἡμέραις τετελεκέναι τὸν κόσμον, φασὶν ὑφ' ἓν πάντα γεγονέναι, καὶ ἐντεῦθεν τοῦτο κατασκευάζουσιν· ἕνεκεν δὲ τάξεως οἴονται τὸν κατά λογον τῶν ἡμερῶν εἰρῆσθαι καὶ τῶν ἐν αὐταῖς γενο μένων.

(PG 12:97b-c.)\n\nStephen Carlson once offered a translation of this:\n\n&gt;“And God finished on the sixth day his work that he did.” In fact, some people assume it was strange for God to have completed the building in the manner of a builder who endured just as many days. They say that all things came to be at once and therefore this is what they maintain. But they suppose that it was for the sake of order that this is stated in the form of a list of days and what happened in them. They probably might use a text that maintains this, which is: “He uttered and they came to be; he commanded and they were created [Psalm 33:9]”\n\n(Carlson goes on to suggest, though, \"I think it’s pretty clear in the quoted extract that he’s reporting some others’ opinion, and the use of ὑπολαμβάνω suggests subtly that he doesn’t agree with it.\")\n\n[**11**] Again see my **Note 9**, and Walton's *The Lost World of Genesis One* for more.\n\n[**12**] Things become even more complicated or convoluted in the fourth book of Augustine's *On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis*, where he seems to further combine this interpretation with the idea of the angels' luminous nature and their knowledge. \n\n[**13**] Though the number of mid- or even high-tier academic publications that make oversimplified or erroneous assumptions about early Biblical interpretation (along the lines of the things I've highlighted here) when mentioning these things tangentially is significant. \n\n[**14**] In my blog post I had added the remark \"which can certainly be uncritically ideologically or theologically motivated,\" and had a note explaining more what I meant here; but I felt like in this post this might all better be omitted.",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! As I have been writing my RPG I have been experiencing a nagging feeling of existential dread. Then I remembered, I have a review to complete! So here is the final part of  *Ancient Black Ops: The Ghost Warriors*:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki_Woxuzwss\n\nLet us begin!\n\n27.42: The sound effects for the battle are *incredibly* bad right now.\n\n27.47: I don’t know from which culture those javelins originate from, but they do not appear Germanic.  A Germanic *framea* would not have had such a long thin head as they would have been too weak for hand-to-hand combat, and Tacitus explicit states the *framea* could be used just as well in close combat as thrown from a distance. DRINK!\n\n29.17: The narrator points out that, after the Romans fall, they are stripped of equipment. It is so refreshing to hear this! Many movies (like the Eagle of the Ninth) show Roman dead with their weapons and armor still with them. In reality their opponents would want to get their hands on it as soon as possible, either for bragging rights, as a divine offering to thank their gods for victory, or because wearing armor is preferable to being disemboweled. RELUCTANT PRAISE DRINK!\n\n29.52: The academic states that the Germans did not “play by the rules” because they did not form up for a conventional battle. This is complete rubbish. All cultures at the times recognized there were different styles of warfare. There was no one “acceptable mode of combat”. The Romans themselves could practice Fabian strategies, where they avoided a pitched fight and instead attacked their opponents supply lines and skirmished. DRINK!\n\n30.42: “This is his (Varus) fourth mistake”. He just activated Arminius’ trap card.\n\n30.58. Now the Roman’s milkshake brings all the Ghost Warriors to the yard. Also, GHOST WARRIORS REFERENCE! DRINK!\n\n31.42: HOLLYWOOD WEAPON TWIRL! DRINK!\n\n32.05: The narrator states that, with the Romans below, the night fighters moved in for the kill. Now, this is perfectly acceptable. There would have definitely been Germanic forces (like the Harii) who would have fought at night. However, creating a mythical group of elite combatants like the ‘Ghost Warriors’ only serves to misrepresent history and create a false impression.\n\n32.15: “Silently, like ghosts, they creep through the trees”. GEE YA THINK?\n\n32.56: The academic says the first thing a Roman legionnaire would see is the white of a German’s eyes and the sword coming down on them. In actuality, hand-to-hand combat at night was very risky as there is a high likelihood of accidentally attacking one of your own companions. In such a situation the Germanic peoples would have still relied on missiles, only moving into close range to kill stragglers or isolated groups. If they did so they would have been using a spear, not a sword. DRINK!\n\n\n\n33.11 The narrator says the Romans have never faced anything like the form of battle they are experiencing now. That is complete dung! The Romans experienced similar fighting in Gaul and in Spain. DRINK!\n\n33.20: “The Ghost Warriors must have seemed like demons”. Or possibly drunk English tourists.\n\n33.34: The academic states this is not the kind of warfare the Romans were trained to fight. Again, absolute dung. The Romans could adapt their strategies and tactics for a wide range of conditions and enemies. Teutoberg occurred because they were lured in by those they perceived to be allies as opposed to encountering a style of warfare they had never witnessed before. DRINK!\n\n33.50: GHOST WARRIORS! DRINK!\n\n36.06: If Varus was leading an army in the middle of an ambush, I doubt he would have had the time to set up a nice clean tent and hang out drinking as is being depicted here. DRINK!\n\n37.51: Holy f#ck, the ancient Germans were metal.\n\n38.01. The narrator says the Battle of Teutoburg forest was the greatest defeat in over two hundred years. With the exception of Carrhae, Noreia and Arausio. DRINK!\n\n38.32: Seriously, did no one check what was in the box first? You don’t really bring unopened items to an emperor. It could be like “SURPRISE! ANGRY COBRA!”.\n\nAnd this is the end of that. I really need to start selecting shorter material. 40 minutes is too draining!\n\nSources\n\nBy the Spear: Philip II, Alexander the Great, and the Rise and Fall of the Macedonian Empire by Ian Worthington\n\nThe Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han, by Mark Edward Lewis\n\nEurope Between the Oceans, by Barry Cunelife\n\nGermania, by Tacitus: http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/tacitus1.html\n\nThe Natural History, by Pliny the Elder: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137\n\nThe Roman Army at War 100 BC - AD 200, by Adrian Goldsworthy\n\nRoman History, by Dio Cassius: http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/home.html\n",

        "text": "I've taken a fascination with /r/DebateFascism lately, with it's rainbow of anachronistic views and its denizens who take a mix'n'match approach to their political beliefs (liberal-minded fascist with libertarian values). Honestly there is something oddly fascinating about watching people so passionately and eloquently defend ideas like 'ethnic heritage' and bemoaning 'degeneracy' while insisting they're not racists, it's a lot like if late-Victorian writers had a message board.\n\nProps though to the mods for actually keeping it as a place for idea exchange and not a neonazi circlejerk, blatant nazism at least doesn't fare too well there. Usually. Anyway, about a week and a half ago I got engaged with one of the nastier posters about Subsaharan Africa, a place he refused to believe could have *possibly* been civilized since they -gasp- didn't have the wheel. You can go through the exchange staring [here,](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateFascism/comments/50bwpu/why_national_socialism_works/d733774?st=it3qxw5y&amp;sh=f0d3fba3) I'm just going to pick out some of my favorite bits.\n\n\n&gt; Oh, did I only mention the wheel? Bad me. Sub-Saharan Africans never used a written language neither.\n\nWhat is ['ge'ez script?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge%27ez_script) Also this is the second time he's mentioned the wheel as some vital cornerstone of civilization.\n\n\n&gt; The Songhai empire fell very fast as a result of internal struggle and as did the Mali empire.\n\n\nRead: Moroccan invasions crippled them and internal struggles finished them off. And it's not like internal power struggles are one of the leading causes for government collapse since the first caveman clubbed the first chief, the double standards these jackasses cling to is absolutely inane. \n\n\n&gt; They still be living in mud buildings tho. He should have invested into better construction methods.\n\nHe bangs on about mud buildings being a sign of inferiority for reasonz, regardless that mud is [fucking amazing as a building material](http://www.archinomy.com/case-studies/712/mud-architecture-construction-details-and-techniques) especially for hot, dry climates, and especially-especially when it's a virtually unlimited resource.\n\n\n&gt; Creating an Empire is not that hard, especially when you got help from [European powers.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png)  \n\nEven though we've previously gone over the Mali/Songhai empires which I'm *fairly certain* established themselves without whitey, he drags up colonial maps of Africa to imply he's got a point about something. I should have used maps of the Moorish conquest of Spain to show how Muslim Africans helped the Europeans found empires too, it'd make as much sense and be just as relevant. He also mentions the wheel for the third goddamn time.\n\n&gt; The fact that Africa got conquered by Europeans proves that they are inferior.\n\nWhat does that imply about Spain getting conquered by the Moors? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\n\nI pointed out that the Aztecs didn't have the wheel either and still had one of the [largest and best-run cities in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenochtitlan#City_plans) when Spain arrived. His reply?\n\n&gt; Yes. I doubt they'd ever become as rich or scientifically advanced as Europe.\n\nRacist chartism, societal development [isn't a straight line,](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/22uea0/the_person_behind_the_chart_tries_to_negate_all/?st=it3rod61&amp;sh=60f364d2) etc. Moving on.\n\n\n&gt; Compare [Timbuktu](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/01/timbuktu/img/04-shrinking-timbuktu-714.jpg) to [Hamburg](http://www.maph.nl/media/media/hamburg_2.jpg) and you tell me that those are equal? Fuck you.\n\n\nI mean, this has nothing to do with the topic of Subsaharan empires, but I'll play along.\n\nLook at [Slovakia!](http://prstevens.stonehippo.com/EasternEurope2011_Part1/_uimages/1790%20Slovakia%20Gypsy%20Home.jpg) So inferior and uncivilized compared to [Somalia!](https://somaliarchitecture.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/cropped-19_the_president_needs_a_middle_class_to_succeed_clip_image004.jpg)\n\n\nAnd he keeps bringing up the goddamn wheel as the lynchpin to his idea that subsaharan Africa was grossly inferior and uncivilized. Never mind a robust [civil service and taxation system that effectively ruled over millions of different people and a political system that kept such a large area stable and capably ruled for centuries.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_Empire#Administration) Or the ability to [organize and maintain a large field army.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_the_Mali_Empire#Organization_after_the_14th_century) And pay no mind to a [wildly lucrative economy and trade system.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_Empire#Economy) That's all easy stuff, the *true* mark of greatness for any civilization is a wooden circle to roll on the ground, that's where the prestige is really at.\n\nInternet neonazi, by the victor invested in me, I dub thee and all thy kind 'wheelboo' for thy fetishization of the wheel's place in the sophistication of society. May you make fools of yourselves forever more so we can all have a good laugh time to time.",

[Until then] we hadn't moved beyond stone age technology\".\n\nI'm not even sure where to start refuting this, but even without looking outside Europe:\n\n* pyramids (which were used for sepulture and had very small chambers, thus almost infinitely scalable) are very different from a palace or a temple or a church (which is meant to be filled with people and to have light coming into it).\n\n* Romans used concrete in their biggest architectures and some Roman buildings also established records for millennia. The Pantheon to date has the tallest dome made with unreinforced concrete.\n\n* The middle ages also had many substantial innovations in architecture and construction technique, such as the introduction of flying buttresses in Gothic architecture, which pulled weight off of the walls of the structure enabling the construction of lighter and brighter structures.\n\n[R6: I am not going to answer further in the linked thread.]",

        "text": "Greeting Badhistoriers. This is the second part of my review of *Ancient Black Ops: The Ghost Warriors*: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki_Woxuzwss\n\nMy mead and my desire to engage in intellectual self-harm is ready to commence!\n\n12.02: Well, I was wondering when the artificially inflated hero-worship will occur. So now they are currently lionizing Arminius, an individual whose three primary accomplishments are luring a Roman army into an ambush, getting his butt kicked by Germanicus and then being killed by his own people.\n\n12.04: “Then I think we have to assume he must have been very charismatic, convincing, probably even good looking because these authors even describe is sparkling dark eyes”. OMG DAE THINK ARMINI IS SOOOOOOO DREAMY! #CHERUSCANHUNKS #STOPROMANOPPRESSION\n\n12.09: “He is 28 years old, and has spent most of his adult life in the Roman army”. Thank you for your service.\n\n13.09: Yeah, the jokes possible in the this scene are *way* too relevant. Gonna leave this one alone.\n\n13.23: The academic right now is talking about about how horrible Roman occupation was and all the evil they got up to. Now, Rome certainly engaged in much brutality. The antics of specific officials in Britain and Spain backfired on them *hard*. However, he does not provide any context to the image he is creating. There was certainly enslavement and pillaging during the conquests, but this was the case with most civilizations of the time period. Roman governance was complex. Many cities and communities were actually granted autonomy and self-government, or the existing elite was incorporated into the structure of Roman government, meaning the common people were immediately subject to officials within their own cultural group. Additionally, in the 1st century AD most Roman legions were stationed on the frontiers, meaning the bulk of the population most likely had very little interactions with Roman soldiers on active duty and so did not encounter any violence from them. DRINK!\n\n14.04: Another scene I am in no way in hell touching.\n\n14.25: GHOST WARRIORS REFERENCE! DRINK!\n\n15.00: Okay, I gotta at least praise the show here for moving away from the image of Romans in Lorica Segmentata and actually have them wear Lorica Hamata in the correct style. COMPLIMENT DRINK!\n\n15.07: “There are reports of a tribal uprising”. Hehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n15.36: BARBARIAN REFERENCE! DRINK!\n\n15.40: “To Varus, the idea that Arminius might be plotting against him is inconceivable”. You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\n\n15.47: The academic asserts that Varus did not understand that people didn’t want Rome. Actually Rome already had a long history of populations rebelling against their rule, and Varus would have been familiar with such events. That's usually when the stabbings began. DRINK!\n\n16.01: “Trusting Arminius would be Varus’ first big mistake”. Gialus Akbarus: “IT’S A TRAP!”\n\n16.11: Meanwhile, back in Middle-Earth……\n\n16.16: “For weeks, Arminius has been laying his plans”. Great, now I have an image of Arminius sitting on a nest and occasionally clucking.\n\n16.35: You can tell the barbarians because they are the ones covered in dirt.\n\n17.02: The academic describes how the Germans were disorganized and could not do anything without it falling apart. Yeah, you don’t create a wide-ranging culture and actually give Rome a serious run for their money by being incompetent. DRINK!\n\n17.17: The academic just called the Roman army the equivalent of the US Army. He is right. I mean, with the exception of language, national identity, tactics, social values, preferred method of governance, equipment, pay, infrastructure, command structure, size, technology and ideology they are quite similar. DRINK!\n\n17.36: “But to finally win over the tribesmen, Arminius must answer one last question” - Who is the best Star Trek captain and why is it Janeway?\n\n17.53: The narrator states the Germans could never defeat the Romans in open battle. Except for the Battles of Noreia, Gallia Narboensis, Burdigala, Arausio and the victories during the Batavian Rebellion, the Germans could never stand against Roman armies. DRINK!\n\n18.01: The academic states that the Roman army was the most powerful military machine in the ancient world. I disagree with this to a *huge* degree. The army of Alexander the great was incredibly competent, and utilized combined arms and flexibility to a degree the Romans could only dream of. The forces of Chandragupta were both large, effective and very well equipped, and the Han army had technology Rome was not familiar with, a larger scale and superior cavalry forces. DRINK!\n\n18.31: The academic says that the only way to defeat the Romans was through guerrilla warfare. Or just vanquish them in open battle like lots of other cultures did. DRINK!\n\n19.58: GHOST WARRIOR REFERENCE! DRINK!\n\n21.04: “Mastering the terrain is a basic part of black-ops warcraft and training”. It is also a basic part of ALL MILITARY WARCRAFT AND TRAINING! DRINK!\n\n22.22: “It’s his second major mistake”. His third? Going against a Sicilian when death is on the line.\n\n22.40: Seriously, why is the face of every German covered with grime?\n\n22.44: GERMANIC BRO-HUGS!\n\n27.08: “EWOKS, ATTACK!”\n\nThis ends the second part.

        "text": "My [original] (https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/51rjs2/question_regarding_korean_comfort_women_for/d7emd7s) comment was a response to a question regarding the comfort women. Much to my pleasure, some lovely individual decided to, shall we say,  \"school me\" on my sources and the Nanking massacre. Said indivdual's comment is no longer there, but considering my response took me a good hour and was close to 1000 words I thought it would be a terrible waste. Nonetheless, I took the liberty to take a screencap of the fellow's comment which can be found [here] (http://i.imgur.com/3etC18T.png).\n\nThe chap says:\n&gt;[Sarah Soh] makes strictly no relation between Nanking and the comfort women.\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah Soh states:\n\n&gt;The army was more systematically involved in building *ianjo* of the prostitution house and the quasi-brothel types during the second phase of the military comfort station system. The authorities believes such facilities would help prevent soldiers from committing random acts of sexual violence against women of the occupied territories - a greater concern after the infamous Nanking massacre, during which tens of thousands of Chinese women were raped.\n\nSarah Soh, (2008), *The Comfort Women: Sexual Violence and Postcolonial Memory in Korea and Japan*, pp. 135\n\n&gt;The paternalistic Japanese state methodically assisted in the system's implementation and development, especially from 1938, after the Nanking massacre, believing that it would help maintain the morale of the troops and prevent rapes of local women.\n\nIbid, pp. 140\n\nThe fellow says:\n&gt;No Mention of the \"Nanking Massacre\" in Chinese Communist Party Records \n\nHistorian Takashi Yoshida states:\n&gt;On 14 December 1938 - the first anniversary of Nanking's capitulation - the CCP organ, *Central China News*, declared that the imperial army had killed \"200,000 compatriots\".\n\nYoshida. T, in *The Nanking Atrocity*, Edited by Wakabayashi, B. T, (New York: Berghann Books, 2008), pp. 251 \n\nMy chum says:\n&gt;No Protest Against the \"Nanking Massacre\" Submitted to the League of Nations\n\nHistorian Takashi Yoshida states:\n&gt;On 10 May 1938, at the one hundred-first session of the council, Koo [Chinese delegate Wellington Koo] delivered another speech requesting effective measures to deter Japanese aggression... he emphasized *'The wanton slaughter of non-combatants by the indiscriminate bombing of undefended towns and non-military centres has been continuing unabated. The unprecedented violence to women and the ruthlessness to children and the deliberate massacre of hundreds of adult males amongst the civilian population, including those removed from refugee camps under false pretences, form the subject of many reports by impartial foreign eyewitnesses. The cruel and barbarous conduct of Japanese troops towards the Chinese people in the occupied areas not only shots the want of regard on the part of the Japanese army for the accepted rules of warfare but also betrays a disgraceful lack of discipline in its rank and file'*... he expressively referred to the Japanese **'reign of terror'** in Nanking and stressed that many other cities, towns and villages faced similar violence and lawlessness.\n\nIbid, pp. 253\n\nMy friend states: \n&gt;No Protest Against the \"Nanking Massacre\" from the United States, Great Britain, or France \n\nHigashinakano Shudo  cites E.W Jeffery of the British Consul in Nanking of Jan 28, 1938 (ignoring Higashinakano's absurd interpretation of the following extracts and his blatant massacre denial):\n&gt;The atrocities committed during the first two weeks of the occupation of the city were of a nature and on a scale which are almost incredible.\n\nAnd again on Jan 29:\n&gt;Military lawlessness continues to a lack of centralized control. Majority of cases are ransacking.\n\nReport from 2nd Brigade, U.S. Marines:\n&gt;Japanese units in Nanking are still engaged in mopping up operations, searching out small bands of snipers. Large numbers of Chinese soldiers who shed their uniforms in an effort to be spared, are summarily shot with characteristic ruthlessness.\n\n\nThe German Embassy in Nanking:\n&gt;Between December 18 and 20, while we were on board the British warship Bee, moored very near Nanking, Sub-lieutenant Kondo spoke to British Major-General Holt. He told him that the Japanese needed to conduct a \"sweep\" of a large island in the Yangtze river downstream of Nanking, since there were 30,000 Chinese soldiers there. This \"sweep\" or \"mopping up\" operation is mentioned in official Japanese Army announcements. But it is, in effect, the murder of defenceless enemy soldiers, and goes against the highest principles of humanitarian warfare.\n\nS. Higashinakano, *The Nanking Massacre: Fact Versus Fiction*, (Tokyo: Sekai Shuppan, Inc, 1998), pp. 142-45\n\nMy comrade says\n&gt; No Mention of the \"Nanking Massacre\" in the American or British Press \n\nHistorian Takashi Yoshida points out the first newspaper to report the atrocities was the English-language **China Press** in 24 of December. **Times of London** also accused the Japanese of *'wholesale looting, violation of women, murder of civilians, eviction of Chinese from their homes, mass executions of war prisoners, and the impressing of able-bodied men'* in Nanking. The **Daily Telegraph** and **Morning Post** estimated 20,000 civilians deaths in Nanking. **Chicago Daily News** and **Associated Press** also reported atrocities in Nanking.\n\nT. Yoshida, Ibid, pp. 250-51\n\nHistorian Kitamura Minoru cites **New York Times** article of 9th of January by Tilman Durdin entitled \"*Japanese Atrocities Marked Fall of Nanking: Mass Killings by the Japanese Embraced Civilians*\"\n&gt;The siege as a whole was feudal and medieval in many aspects. The Chinese defence within a city wall, the wholesale burning of villages, mansions and populous business districts for miles around the metropolis and the slaughter, rape and looting by the Japanese after their occupation of the city all seem to belong to a more barbaric, vanished period.\n\nKitamura, M, *The Politics of Nanjing: An Impartial Investigation*, translated by Hal Gold, (Maryland: University Press of America, 2007), pp. 113\n\nMy buddy says:\n&gt;No Gag Order Imposed in Connection with the Nanking Incident \n\nTIL, Japanese author Ishikawa Tatsuzo *wasn't* imprisoned in 1938 for writing about Japanese atrocities in his book *Soldiers Alive*, and the book totally wasn't banned by the Japanese government.\n\nI am impressed that with 60 years of historiography of the Nanking Massacre/Atrocities/Incident that he still has the audacity, no - bravery, to come out with such absurdity. I can assure you, I took great pleasure in typing all this for him, as well as for all of you.\n\nPeace out.\n\nMuh blessed sources:\n\n* Higashinakano, S, *The Nanking Massacre: Fact Versus Fiction*, (Tokyo: Sekai Shuppan, Inc, 1998)\n\n* Kitamura, M, *The Politics of Nanjing: An Impartial Investigation*, translated by Hal Gold, (Maryland: University Press of America, 2007)\n\n* Soh, S.

        "text": "So, just as I was thinking it’s been a while since I did some nice Balkan badhistory, something comes up. Over the past month, a new argument has been going round apologist circles: that the Radovan Karadzic verdict – which I dealt with in more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4ne4ar/radovan_karadzic_did_nothing_wrong/)  - actually ‘exonerated’ the mastermind behind the whole Yugoslav Wars, Slobodan Milosevic. Initially this seems to date back to [an article by Andy Wilcoxson in mid-July](http://www.slobodan-milosevic.org/news/smorg-aw071816.htm) on a site whose URL suggests it might be just a teensy bit biased. It was picked up a couple of days later by [Neil Clark, writing for RT,](https://www.rt.com/op-edge/354362-slobodan-milosevic-exonerated-us-nato/) and more recently by [John Pilger.](http://johnpilger.com/articles/provoking-nuclear-war-by-media) And of course, the Serbian government themselves have decided to jump on the bandwagon, with both the [foreign minister](http://rs.n1info.com/a184916/Vesti/Vesti/Dacic-Hag-presudom-Karadzicu-priznao-da-Milosevic-i-Srbija-nisu-krivi.html) and the [labour minister](http://rs.n1info.com/a184807/Vesti/Vesti/Vulin-Hag-potvrdio-ispravnost-Miloseviceve-politike.html) joining in. So, let’s take a look at what Wilcoxson has to say, and then add in any other comments that need to be made about the other articles towards the end.\n\nBefore starting, I’d like to comment that it’s amusing that those who normally condemn ICTY as a political tribunal or kangaroo court are now accepting its judgements as ‘proof’, and those who normally deny or downplay the atrocities in Bosnia altogether are now arguing that they did happen, but just weren’t Milosevic’s fault. But to get to the substance of the argument itself, it rests at its core on one passage in the [Karadzic verdict](http://www.icty.org/x/cases/karadzic/tjug/en/160324_judgement.pdf), in paragraph 3460:\n\n&gt; The March 24th Karadzic judgment states that “the Chamber is not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence presented in this case to find that Slobodan Milosevic agreed with the common plan” to permanently remove Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats from Bosnian Serb claimed territory.\n\nOK, this argument is flimsy for a few reasons. Firstly, the crucial three words are *“in this case”*. This trial is about Karadzic, not Milosevic. The prosecution were not trying to prove Milosevic’s guilt, which was only relevant insofar as it related to Karadzic’s. Secondly, Wilcoxson appears not to understand how Joint Criminal Enterprise works. This passage refers purely to whether or not the JCE indictees *agreed* with the ‘common plan’ of ethnic cleansing sought by Karadzic and Co – whether they *participated* in it anyway is a different question. And undoubtedly Milosevic did – he set Karadzic up with his army, paramilitaries and weapons, and continued provide him with material and logistical support more or less throughout the war. Whether that qualifies as aiding and abetting the crimes or just complicity in them is debatable, but both certainly constitute criminal responsibility.\n\nThen there follows a few short passages about how Milosevic disagreed and fell out with Karadzic over various issues, more and more as the war went on. All true, of course, but this doesn’t change the fact that Milosevic continued to supply Karadzic. He had the power to cut the Bosnian Serb separatists off, and he chose not to use it.\n\n&gt; The Chamber found that “the declaration of sovereignty by the SRBiH Assembly in the absence of the Bosnian Serb delegates on 15 October 1991, escalated the situation, but that Milosevic was not on board with the establishment of Republika Srpska in response. The judgment says that “Slobodan Milosevic was attempting to take a more cautious approach”.\n\nYes, he did take a more cautious approach. He wanted to illegally dismember Bosnia covertly and in a way that could still present him as looking reasonable and pragmatic, in contrast to Karadzic’s extremist and confrontational attitude.\n\n&gt; The judgment states that in intercepted communications with Radovan Karadzic, “Milosevic questioned whether it was wise to use ‘an illegitimate act in response to another illegitimate act’ and questioned the legality of forming a Bosnian Serb Assembly.” The judges also found that “Slobodan Milosevic expressed his reservations about how a Bosnian Serb Assembly could exclude the Muslims who were ‘for Yugoslavia’.”\n\nAnd if you check the rest of the paragraphs for both of these quotations, you’ll see that Karadzic immediately dismissed these concerns (they’re from a telephone conversation between the two), and there is no indication that Milosevic particularly pushed them any further.\n\n&gt; The trial chamber notes that “In private meetings, Milosevic was extremely angry at the Bosnian Serb leadership for rejecting the Vance-Owen Plan and he cursed the Accused.”\n\nAgain, this is true but not that relevant to the question of Milosevic’s guilt. As the war dragged on and the international sanctions on Serbia proper cut deeper and deeper, Milosevic became more conscious of his need to shore up his power based at home by getting sanctions cut, and began to pressure the Serbs to end the war sooner. And yes, he publicly accepted the Vance-Owen Plan and pressured the Srpska leadership to accept it. But this wasn’t because he actually intended to fulfil its terms – as with the attempted peace process in neighbouring Croatia, Milosevic wanted to simply to accept the interim territorial arrangements, knowing that they could then frustrate the full implementation of the plan and maintain a ‘frozen conflict’. But he did get angry when the Srpska ‘parliament’ rejected the VOP, partly because it meant the continuation of sanctions, but also because Karadzic had made him look like a fool and undermined him.\n\n&gt; The judgment states that “Milosevic also questioned whether the world would accept that the Bosnian Serbs who represented only one third of the population of BiH would get more than 50% of the territory and he encouraged a political agreement.”\n\nAgain, this is framed towards making Milosevic look moderate and reasonable, demanding only ~50% of Bosnia for a new separate Serb ethno-state rather than the 60-70% Karadzic insisted on. This omits the fact that Bosnia was legally an independent sovereign state which they were not, legally, supposed to be dividing at all.\n\n&gt; Because of the rift between Milosevic and the Bosnian-Serbs, the judges note that “the FRY reduced its support for the RS and encouraged the Bosnian Serbs to accept peace proposals.”\n\n“Reduced”, not “ended”, being the important thing here.\n\n&gt; Slobodan Milosevic was vilified by the entire western press corps and virtually every politician in every NATO country. They called him “the Butcher of the Balkans.” They compared him to Hitler and accused him of genocide. They demonized him and made him out to be a bloodthirsty monster, and they used that false image to justify not only economic sanctions against Serbia, but also the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia and the Kosovo war.\n\nInteresting line of argument, given that [Milosevic himself claimed that several senior British politicians actually aided and propped up his regime.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1332552/Milosevic-Ill-name-British-leaders-who-helped-me.html) I’ll quote here from Susan Woodward, generally regarded as a mainstream scholar of the topic with one of the most generous assessment of Milosevic:\n\n&gt; The sanctions aimed to overthrow President Milosevic and his policy, but negotiators became increasingly independent on keeping Milosevic in power as the primary interlocutor and the primary lever of pressure with the Bosnian Serbs.\n\nOutside of fringe apologists, that’s as close as you get in the historiography to a picture of constant vilification of Milosevic by Western officials – that they had a conflicting and contradictory attitude to him. Most of the literature portrays Western officials – especially David Owen - as going out of their way to build up a good relationship with Milosevic. Yes, Nazi comparisons were over the top, as they are 99% of the time. But that’s media sensationalism and simplicity for you – the simplest way to portray someone as a bad guy is to use Nazi comparisons. Milosevic wasn’t in some way unique in this regard. Also worth adding that Milosevic’s own media mouthpieces in Serbia regularly compared people like Tudjman, the Bosnian government, and the KLA to Nazis.\n\n&gt; Slobodan Milosevic had to spend the last five years of his life in prison defending himself and Serbia from bogus war crimes allegations over a war that they now admit he was trying to stop.\n\nSo are the war crimes non-existent allegations, or did they happen but Milosevic simply wasn’t involved? You can’t have it both ways. Also, he wasn’t defending Serbia. Serbia was not on trial at the ICTY, only individuals. Serbia was on trial at the ICJ in 2006-07, but that’s a not just a different trial but a completely different court.\n\n&gt; The ICTY did nothing to publicize the fact that they had cleared Milosevic of involvement in the joint criminal enterprise.\n\nProbably because they didn’t clear him. [Indeed, an ICTY spokesman expressly denied doing so.](http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=19&amp;nav_id=98957)\n\n&gt; They quietly buried that finding 1,303 pages into the 2,590 page Karadzic verdict knowing full well that most people would probably never bother to read it.\n\nIf they didn’t want people to read it, why print it at all? Why not just keep it to themselves? Publishing it but burying it makes no sense at all.\n\n&gt; The presiding judge in the Radovan Karadzic trial, O-Gon Kwon of South Korea, was also one of the judges in the Slobodan Milosevic trial. Milosevic’s exoneration by the Karadzic trial chamber may be an indication of how the Milosevic chamber would have eventually ruled, at least on the Bosnia charges, if Milosevic had lived to see the conclusion of his own trial.\n\nDo you not think you might first check the documents of Milosevic’s own trial to look for an indication of how the ruling might have gone first, rather than immediately looking to someone else’s trial? There is in fact a document which could be taken as a ‘provisional verdict’ of sorts – the judges’ [“Decision on motion for judgment of acquittal”](http://www.icty.org/x/cases/slobodan_milosevic/tdec/en/040616.htm). After the prosecution had made their case, Milosevic’s defence (himself and a couple of support lawyers) claimed that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges, and that Milosevic should thus be acquitted immediately. With the exception of one very minor count (they held that the prosecution had failed to prove that the massacres at Kotor Varos constituted genocide rather than ‘just’ crimes against humanity), the judges held that the prosecution had provided enough evidence, if accepted, to convict Milosevic on all charges. Of course, that doesn’t mean that’s what would have happened – the presentation of the defence case would likely have got some of the charges reduced or dismissed; inevitably the case against someone seems strongest just after the prosecution but just before the defence. But it’s far closer to an official verdict than piecing together a few passages from Karadzic’s trial indicating he and Milosevic were not entirely on the same page. \n\nIt also suggests that, as with other heavily publicised trials where one side tries to represent themselves rather than hiring real lawyers (case in point, the Lipstadt-Irving trial), Milosevic had failed to understand the case against him, or to grasp how weak his position was. Contrary to the claims of his apologists, Milosevic did not perform well at the trial, routinely going off into irrelevant tangents, wasting his time with political posturing, and taking for granted as fact particular opinions which were at best controversial and at worst widely rejected. In some cases he even missed obvious points which would have aided his defence because he seemed to prefer incredulous grand and bombastic counter-arguments to more mundane but also more plausible ones.\n\n&gt; It’s worth recalling that Slobodan Milosevic died under a very suspicious set of circumstances.\n\nAh, the obligatory poisoning conspiracy theories. For the record, Milosevic’s own son has rejected the claim he was poisoned and simply accused ICTY of negligence, saying they should have allowed him to travel for treatment. On the other side, people (e.g. Carla Del Ponte, ICTY Prosecutor) have suggested that Milosevic deliberately took medication which would worsen his condition so he could seek treatment in Russia.\n\n&gt; This all gives rise to well-founded suspicion that powerful geopolitical interests would rather Milosevic die before the end of his trial than see him acquitted and have their vicious lies exposed.\n\nMaybe if he was going to be acquitted, yes. But as we’ve seen, he almost certainly was not going to be. Also, this is somewhat circular reasoning – the death is used as proof that he would be acquitted, while at the same time the coming acquittal is cited as a motive for the death.\n\nOK, that’s Wilcoxson done, let’s just take a small look at what Clark has to add:\n\n&gt; But amid all the blather and the hype surrounding the ’trial of the century’ it soon became apparent the prosecution was in deep, deep trouble. The Sunday Times quoted a legal expert who claimed that “Eighty percent of the prosecution’s opening statements would have been dismissed by a British court as hearsay.” That, I believe, was a generous assessment.\n\nDid you consider that there might be a difference between a standard British criminal court and the Hague Tribunal? A significant reason (though not the only one) why hearsay is not allowed in the former is that they are generally jury trials, and the jurors are considered not to be skilled enough to evaluate the reliable parts of hearsay evidence. ICTY trials, by contrast, are conducted by professional expert judges. It’s worth noting that the Nuremberg Trials also permitted hearsay evidence.\n\n&gt; The problem was that this was a show trial, one in which geopolitics came before hard evidence.\n\nI’m going to cite [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3j2zcj/was_the_nuremburg_trials_a_kangaroo_court/culwdrz) from AskHistorians here. While I do think that ICTY is considerably closer to being a fair and normal tribunal than Nuremberg, many of the same arguments about it can be applied. Show trials are typically quick, simple affairs. Milosevic’s trial was sprawling over years; both Clark and Wilcoxson have already conceded the colossal nature of the Karadzic trial, intimidating to the kind of lay observer show trials are generally directed at. Or to use another comparison, take the Eichmann trial in 1961, which was in many ways a show trial (though less so than say, the Moscow show trials in the 1930s), even though the accused was obviously guilty. Eichmann’s lawyer, Robert Servatius, consistently tried to keep the trial as close to an individual criminal trial as possible, and attempted to block the tangential, irrelevant and politicised material that the Israeli prosecutor Gideon Hausner, encouraged by Ben-Gurion, kept trying to push. By contrast, it was *Milosevic* who kept inserting irrelevant political arguments into his own trial, and the court that tried to restrain him from doing so.\n\n&gt; The trouble for NATO was that by the time Milosevic’s trial was due to start, the Kosovo narrative had already unraveled. The lurid claims made by the US and its allies about genocide and hundreds of thousands being killed, catalogued by the great John Pilger here, had been shown to be false.\n\nThing is, many of these alleged claims about hundreds of thousands being killed were no such thing. Neither Pilger or Clark provides specific sources, but I’ve seen other apologists pushing this argument citing US government documents which do indeed refer to hundreds of thousands missing, but quite clearly imply they are being detained, not dead.\n\n&gt; In September 2001, a UN court officially held that there had been no genocide in Kosovo.\n\nHere Clark cites a BBC source, neglecting to mention that the same source also notes that the court held that there had been a \"systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\" by Serbian forces in Kosovo, and that they did constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes. If you think that’s somehow Milosevic off the hook, then you have a bizarre idea of how international courts work.\n\n&gt; So in an attempt to beef up their weakening case against Milosevic the prosecutors at The Hague had to bring in new charges relating to the war in  Bosnia, accusing ‘Slobo’ of being part of a ‘joint criminal conspiracy’ to kill/ethnically cleanse Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims in pursuance of a ’Greater Serbia’ project.\n\nSo the fact that ICTY refrained from indicting Milosevic on the most serious charges for years, somehow indicates that they had a bias against him? Right.\n\n&gt; The irony is that the former Yugoslav President had already been praised by President Clinton for his role in brokering a peace deal in Bosnia in 1995, which was signed in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nBut you’re still running with this line of US-Milosevic antipathy that had always been there?\n\n&gt; The truth is that Milosevic was no hardcore Serb nationalist but a lifelong socialist, whose commitment was always to a multi-racial, multi-ethnic Yugoslavia. His aim throughout his time in power was not to build a ’Greater Serbia‘, but to try and keep Federal Yugoslavia together, as the ICTY now belatedly acknowledges.\n\nOK, the first ten words of this sentence are arguably true; there’s a serious argument that Milosevic was not, at heart, a Serb nationalist, but merely utilised Serb nationalism to bolster his own political power and position, and backed away from it when it became a liability. Everything after that, however, is nonsense. I’m still astonished at how some leftists can believe that the man who presided over the end of Titoist socialism, and the process of privatisation and market liberalisation in Serbia was somehow a diehard socialist all along. [Oh, and he was a kleptocrat too.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/29/balkans.warcrimes) As for his supposed commitment to a united multi-ethnic Yugoslavia, this is a popular one with apologists. Portraying Milosevic as merely fighting to keep as much as Yugoslavia united as possible skims over the fact that he only put up more than a token fight when the areas in question were those subject to Serb nationalist irredentist claims. Indeed, Milosevic’s closest ally, Borisav Jovic, wrote in his memoirs that he and Milosevic had discussed forcibly “amputating” Slovenia and Croatia (except for the Serb-claimed areas of the latter) from Yugoslavia as early as June 1990.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the aforementioned US Ambassador Warren Zimmerman, whose malign intervention to scupper a diplomatic solution helped trigger the Bosnian conflict got off scot-free.\n\nOK, this refers to the March 1992 Cuitleiro Plan. After Izetbegovic signed the plan, he started complaining about it to Zimmerman, who asked him why he’d signed it if he disliked it so much. Zimmerman himself denies this was in any way an encouragement for Izetbegovic to repudiate the signature (which he did a few days later), and that he actually encouraged him to stick to the plan now he’d signed it. Nevertheless, I can see how in isolation Zimmerman’s actions might look like a coded statement. But I still find this argument unconvincing for two reasons. Firstly, what is called the Cuitleiro Plan was actually just a set of principles for the drawing up of a plan – there was nothing close to an actual completed agreement yet. Secondly, the US had already made clear its opposition to a partition plan along the lines of Cuitleiro, and its support for recognising an independent single Bosnia, *before* Izetbegovic signed.\n\n&gt; The ‘Blame it All on Slobo’ campaign saw facts simply thrown out of the window. One article, written, I kid ye not, by an Oxford University Professor of European Studies even had Milosevic as leader of Yugoslavia in 1991 (the year that Slovenia broke away). In fact the Bosnian Croat, Ante Markovic, was the leader of the country at the time.\n\nWell, Markovic was Prime Minister. The rotating head of state was at the time held by Jovic. This is somewhat glossing over the fact that Markovic had little real authority by this point, and the Yugoslav Army was de facto answering to Milosevic.\n\n&gt; Farkas also said that Milosevic ordered no paramilitary groups should be permitted to operate anywhere in Kosovo.\n\nThen that order was not enforced, as the notorious ‘Scorpions’ paramilitary, infamous for their participation in the atrocities at Vukovar and Srebrenica, did participate in the Serbian campaign in Kosovo, and collaborated with Serbian official forces.\n\nMilosevic was guilty. He didn’t keep Yugoslavia together, but destroyed it. Get used to it.\n\nEDIT: Also, amusingly, even CounterPunch, generally a haven for Milosevic apologists, has run [an article](http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/08/22/claims-of-exoneration-the-case-of-slobodan-milosevic/) pointing out that Milosevic was not exonerated.\n",

        "text": "Today, in my \"intro to fine arts\" class, which all freshman at my school take, we watched Saul Bass's 1968 documentary \"Why Man Creates\". I don't really expect much from this class, but already, on the third day, we've hit a low point which makes me seriously worry about how this class will proceed.\n\nIf you haven't seen the documentary, there is a scene in which \"all of western history\" is represented by a rapidly growing building. This is already bad history territory, but also makes pretty ordinary mistakes that aren't really worth talking about.  On the other hand, my professor's explanations are horribly bizarre:\n\n* First, he tried to explain the \"dark ages\", which apparently occurred \"about 600 years ago\". He claimed that Rome was so debaucherous and immoral that the Christian church decided that another great flood or similar disaster was inevitable, as punishment for these sins. Hence, after the Roman empire fell, the church became so focused on preparing for the end of the world that they just didn't have time for other things, bringing all scientific, artistic, and cultural advancement to a \"grinding halt.\"\n* The renaissance occurred when the western world rediscovered the Roman civilization by excavating buried and destroyed ruins via archaeology. \n\nR5: Most of this goes without saying, but I'll explain what's wrong with these narratives anyway. Firstly, as most people here know, the \"Christian Dark Ages\" are a fairly misleading way of framing the middles ages, but even if they did exist, they would have occurred more than six hundred years ago. Six hundred years ago was the early 15th century, and at that time the Renaissance had already begun to flourish. Furthermore, my professor's claims about a supposed apocalyptic mania are absolutely absurd and not supported by any evidence. Rather, as I understand it, there was a temporary disruption to scientific and technological development that occurred during this period, due primarily to the loss of central political authority as well as the collapse of the communication channels and infrastructure previously supported by Rome. On the other hand, his claims about the renaissance are also incredibly off the mark. During the middle ages, the west did not forget about Rome, only to rediscover them via archaeology. On the contrary, Rome was still a large part of the cultural consciousness of most of the population of the former empire. In fact, political leaders of the time would often appeal to their Roman heritage or their affinity with the Romans as a source of political authority. Similarly, Latin was still widely used among the church and the educated.",

        "author": "LitZippo",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/51f5j3/was_the_western_front_of_ww1_fought_with_mostly/",
        "text": "So in October the newest entry in the *Battlefield* video game series comes out. *Battlefield 1* has come up [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4y5ywi/torpedo_boats_and_biplanes_what_battlefield_1s/?) and [elsewhere](http://www.pcgamer.com/we-showed-battlefield-1-to-a-world-war-i-historian/) regarding the accuracy and anachronisms of its WW1 setting, weapons and vehicles etc. I'm not here to add more to that argument, at the end of the day in my eyes *Battlefield* is a video game and I don't expect it to be historically accurate in any extreme way.\n\nSomething that's coming up a lot when discussing this game though is the age old problem of revisionism that *Battlefield 1*, to its credit, has done well in avoiding (in my eyes anyway). The problem stems from looking at WW1 as what David Reynolds called the \"Literary War\". There's been [posts] (https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2tfibu/you_cant_make_a_movie_about_the_first_world_war/?) before about the annoying tropes surrounding the perception of WW1- the ignorance of tactics, the unmoving and pointlessness of the conflict, the \"Donkeys leading Lions\", and perhaps worst, the focus on *only* the Western Front. These all surfaced again when the game was revealed, and we've seen it before when people discuss WW1 films and games. Something that has bothered me, however, is the pervasive idea amongst some that including people of colour in the conflict (especially the Western Front) is somehow historically inaccurate or (to use their own words) \"pandering\".  \n\n[In a thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/515q38/battlefield_1_versus_reality/) that (I guess) is attempting to highlight how ridiculous it is to include people of colour in various armies, you can find numerous comments that purport that the Western Front was somehow a \"White Front\", only populated and fought by White Europeans: \n\n\n&gt;Most countries did use some colonial regiments, but the European part of the conflict back then had mostly white Europeans. Even in WW2 in the European theatre that was still the case for the most part. I understand people like their ethnicity being represented in a game, but you cannot make history more diverse, it just doesn't work that way.\n\nI'm only going to refer to the first part, and I grant it's a bit vague but I feel saying that \"the European part of the conflict back then had mostly white Europeans\" is both uninformed and ignorant to just how many nationalities and ethnicities were involved and stationed on the Western Front. Here's another comment on why the inclusion of black characters is somehow an insult to the Harlem Hellfighters-\n\n&gt;Because the Hellfighters actually fought in the European theatre... Dice is just finding random groups of Black soldiers and making them the mainstay of the Europe conflict..\n\nAlso-\n\n&gt;Yeah, no. Use Google to look up photos of the trenches sometime and count how many non-white faces you see.\n\nColonial troops made up large and significant parts of the British and French Army in WW1 *on the Western Front*. At the same time the BEF fielded 70,000 men, The Indian Army represented the largest volunteer army in the world, with 150,000 of its 240,000 men ready for immediate service. By November 1914 Indian troops were holding positions around the Ypres. Alongside them were thirty-seven battalions of French troops from Senegal, Africa, Algeria and Morocco. It was many of these men that would later bear the brunt of the initial gas attacks in Flanders in April 1915. As historian David Olusoga puts it- \n\n&gt;\"By the time the manoeuvrings of 1914 had fizzled out and the Western Front had stabilised, the fantasy of the \"White Mans War\" had, like other assurances of the war, been exposed as naive.\"\n\nFurthermore, I think it also it's important to recognise that front line troops (the ones you may find 'while googling to look up photos of the trenches') were only a tiny proportion of the huge machine that operated in the theatre. While the French were more than keen to pour, as [Charles Mangin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mangin) put it, \"Reservoirs of [colonial troops]\" into the front lines (Some 500,000 wore the uniform of the French army and manned the trenches of the Western Front), most black British troops (with the exception of a small few, see [Walter Tull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Tull)) were used as mass labour behind the lines. \n\nIronically, the Western Front during those four years of conflict was possibly the most ethnically diverse place on Earth at that time. Muslim prayers were held in the Fields of Flanders, Indian Soldiers observed the Eid Prayers before sitting down to share celebratory meals with their Indian Comrades of other faiths. Ramadan was observed in trenches, troops from the Punjab marked the Sikh festival of Vaisakhi. In British Barracks and hospitals Chinese labourers (Over 100,000 men served in the Chinese Labour Corps) entertained troops and their own countrymen, marking Chinese New Years and Dragon Festivals. French troops were particularly entertained by displays of Tai chi and Martial Arts.\n\nTo quote *The Worlds War*- \n&gt;\"The Great European War- as it was then still called- became the greatest employment opportunity in history, and hundreds of thousands of men, from some of the most beautiful lands and islands on earth descended upon Flanders and Northern France. They came from Bermuda, Macedonia, Malta, Greece, Arabia, Palestine, Singapore, Mauritius, Madagascar, Vietnam, Fiji, the Cook Island, the Seychelles.\"\n\nTo put it in perspective, take the *[Halbmondlager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halbmondlager)*. This German prisoner of war camp is one of the most bizarre and overlooked parts of the war on the Western Front. It housed almost 5,000 Muslim prisoners who had fought for the Allied side. The intended purpose of the camp was to convince detainees to wage jihad against the United Kingdom and France. Living in relative luxury, the camp included the first ever mosque built on German soil, all intended as part of a \"Jihad Experiment\" which the Germans thought would help turn the colonies against British and French rule. \n\nThis problem is really bigger than a video games portrayal of soldier diversity. At the end of the day *Battlefield* has included ethnicities to represent more of its player base, but the reaction or veiled excuse to the inclusion of non-white non-Europeans in the conflict as somehow \"inaccurate\" is further examples of the pervasive and very real white-washing that occurred after WW1. It's no surprise or secret that the contributions and sacrifices that many colonial soldiers are forgotten and overlooked to this day, but it's downright dishonest to try and claim that the Western Front was a theatre only fought by White Europeans. \n\nIf you're interested, here's a fascinating book called \"[Our enemies: 96 character heads from German prisoner of war camps](https://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/articles/colonial-troops)\", a propaganda book published by Germany to show the public the faces of various \"exotic\" or \"Alien\" soldiers from around the world Germany was fighting against.  \n\n[Furthermore, here's an amazing picture of Moroccan Spahis on patrol in Belgium.](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/cavalry-patrol-moroccan-spahis?shelfitemviewer=1&amp;fromother=1&amp;imgSelectedId=229c99b0-8737-4a82-bee5-261fd5416d37)\n\nSources-\n\n*The World's War*- David Olusoga\n\n*The World's War: Forgotten Soldiers of Empire*- BBC\n\n*British Library Website* \n\n*Race and War in France: Colonial Subjects in the French Army, 1914-1918*\n\n*[Germany's grand First World War jihad experiment](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/museums/11022199/Germanys-Grand-WW1-Jihad-Experiment.html)*- Telegraph\n\nEDIT- I kind of messed up my title (I've never been great at them!) in that my post doesn't really aim to answer the question but more talk about the general dismissive attitude towards other ethnicities rolls on the Western Front.

The most experienced warriors would be the older and wealthier members of a community. Tacitus also wrote of younger fighters would would travel to the territory of other Germanic peoples who were waging war in order to offer their services, or would enter the following of high-status individuals, but such individuals could hardly be called elite. DRINK!\n\n0.08: The narrator states these “elite warriors” where known as ‘Ghost Warriors’. I am guessing this description stems from Tacitus’ description of the Arians (or Harii):\n\n“Now the Aryans (Arians/Harii), besides their forces, in which they surpass the several nations just recounted, are in their persons stern and truculent; and even humour and improve their natural grimness and ferocity by art and time. They wear black shields, their bodies are painted black, they choose dark nights for engaging in battle; and by the very awe and ghastly hue of their army, strike the enemy with dread, as none can bear this their aspect so surprising and as it were quite infernal. For, in all battles the eyes are vanquished first.”\n\nSo the creators of this series have taken the tactics of a particular people, and inaccurately applied it to the entirety of a culture. DRINK!\n\n1.23: The narrator describes Germany in the first decade of the 1st Century AD as being inhospitable. So inhospitable a huge array of peoples dwelt there for thousands of years. DRINK!\n\n1.37: The academic says that, for the Romans, Germany was the final frontier. First of all, that was Star Trek V. Second of all, the Romans were well aware of other lands and peoples dwelling beyond Germania. Pliny the Elder wrote extensively of northern Europe. DRINK!\n\n1.48: Reference to barbarism! DRINK!\n\n1.54: “As Roman soldiers move into this landscape their minds fill with nightmare images”. That’s what they get for reading Chomsky’s essays on politics and history.\n\n2.05: “It was a dark place, it was full of strange people, it was dangerous”. So Glasgow then?\n\n2.35: “The Individual German Tribesman considered himself to be a freeman”. A German prisoner to Roman legionnaires: “AM I BEING DETAINED?”\n\n2.40: “They are warlike and dangerous”. As opposed to warlike and harmless.\n\n3.01: The academic asserts that the name “Germany” came from an old Germanic word for spear. Uh, no. The word originated from the Celts. Tacitus states that:\n\n“The name Germany, on the other hand, they say is modern and newly introduced, from the fact that the tribes which first crossed the Rhine and drove out the Gauls, and are now called Tungrians, were then called Germans.”\n\nDRINK!\n\n4.08: Notice how the guy slinging a stone and the pot getting destroyed are two separate shots. I think it is likely he just kept on missing and the film crew basically said “Screw it, throw the rock from three feet away and we’ll do a close-up”.\n\n5.20: The Germanic warrior just destroyed a watermelon with his club. However, the classic watermelon did not become widespread in northern Europe until the medieval period, meaning a Germanic warrior would have no idea what the hell that fruit was. DRINK!\n\n5.43: HOLLYWOOD SPEAR TWIRL! DRINK!\n\n6.03: GHOST WARRIORS REFERENCE! DRINK!\n\n6.09: SPECIAL FORCES REFERENCE. DRINK!\n\n6.23: ANOTHER GHOST WARRIORS REFERENCE! DRINK!\n\n6.28: The academic calls the Germanic warriors a black-ops unit. The accepted term is “African-American ops unit”. DRINK!\n\n7.55: They are talking about all the techniques these “Ghost Warriors” used. The problem is, outside of the brief description by Tacitus, we have NO SOURCES FOR ANY OF THIS! AND YET THEY ARE PRESENTING ALL THESE DETAILS AS FACTUAL! BAD SCHOLARSHIP DRINK!\n\n8.14: Again, the narrator says the “Ghost Warriors” were a source of legend and terror to the Romans. There is absolutely no evidence for this claim. DRINK!\n\n9.21: ANOTHER BLACK OPS REFERENCE! DRINK!\n\n9.34: A Roman sentry is being attacked at night. The Problem is the Romans were very, very smart. They did not have lone guards in the forest at night. They would build a strong encampment and have those guards sensibly patrol from within fortifications. DRINK!\n\n10.05: The narrator states Augustus wanted Varus to bring Germania into the Empire. Dio Cassius states that the Romans already ruled parts of Germania, and Varus was the governor, not a conquering general. Additionally, Varus was lured into an ambush  after responding to an uprising, not trying to claim the whole of the region. DRINK!\n\n11.36: The narrator states the Cherusci lived in the northwest of Germania, but the map makes it clear they are in the center. BAD GEOGRAPHY DRINK!\n\n11.58: BARBARIAN REFERENCE! DRINK!\n\nAnd that is the end of the first part. From now on I am doing the 40 minutes videos in threes. See you for the next entry!\n\n\nSources\n\nThe 5000 Year Secret History of the Watermelon, by Mark Strauss: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150821-watermelon-fruit-history-agriculture/\n\nEurope Between the Oceans, by Barry Cunelife.\n\nGermania, by Tacitus: http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/tacitus1.html\n\nThe Natural History, by Pliny the Elder: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137\n\nThe Roman Army at War 100 BC - AD 200, by Adrian Goldsworthy\n\nRoman History, by Dio Cassius: http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/home.html\n",

While annexed territories drifted apart as Soviet leadership weakened (sharing its [ stagnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Stagnation), remembering times before the 80s there are still a number of reasons to argue for how *red* the situation actually was (not only during actual occupation). \n\nWWII and aftermath\n\n* Mass deportation as ordered by the Soviet ([example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Germans_from_Romania_after_World_War_II))\n* Adopting the constitution, ideology and installing 'fellow travelers' into the ruling party (huge turnaround from anything Romania saw politically between the World Wars). The 2nd constitution (1952), which wasn't a total copy of the Soviet one any longer, was dubbed \"constitution of building socialism\" and voted in 324 to zero. Conveniently, the judiciary was made dependent of the National Assembly which again accepted everything the Party (yes, the only one) wanted. Secret police installed, one of the harshest in the Eastern Bloc, namely the Securitate.\n* In essence, the whole ordeal was similar to [Moldova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldavian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic#Culture) (/annexed Bessarabia) which was officially inside the Soviet Union and not 'only' an allied country under strong influence.\n\n+\n\n* Departure of the red army (by the end of the '50s) didn't change things that much from the actual Soviet occupation. Following the Budapest uprising it became clear that that move was mostly symbolic in nature (giving birth to the cynical joke of their never \"having left\" [see Transnistria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria#Military))\n* Secret service, trade agreements (if one can call them that) and the people's (later socialist) party were continuously over-sought by the Soviets (will provide links shortly to expand).",

I just don't see any other audience on Reddit that would be potentially be more interested in this then this one.\n\nThe reasons for why I would argue that documentaries are worse than movies that are simple, the common man and woman usually assume when they are watching a documentary that it is 99% correct, because it is supposed to be a type of educational program. In fact an alarming, I repeat alarming rate of people take Hollywood dead serious when it comes to movies, I have encountered HISTORY STUDENTS that take the movie Gladiator at face value, and even 300!\n\nSo when you take that into consideration, just imagine how much, \"damage\" documentaries are doing?!\nNow here is what I do not understand, why are documentaries trying to be Hollywood, when Hollywood exists and already took the spot, this means they are chasing for a niche audience but as collateral damage they are corrupting many minds with ridiculous statements and ideas. \n\nHere would be some of their largest sins:\n\nMost of documentaries make these flat over-arching statements(Greatest, Longest, Most Powerful etc...) that frankly not even Hollywood dares sometimes, they blatantly avoid mentioning a lot of information (I remember watching three documentaries about the first crusade back to back, and all of them had a different list of the crusader leaders, and even if you merged them you still wouldn't get all of them), a lot of them do not introduce the concept of \"sources\" to the audience seeing how invaluable they are  to history and most of them just try to accentuate myths or rather if we had historical documentaries in the 19cnth Vikings would always wear horned helmets.\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4zyx7c/this_week_on_dont_trust_everything_you_read_just/",
        "text": "The article is \"The Replacement of the Longbow by Firearms in the English Army\" written by Thomas Esper for *Technology and Culture* in the Summer of 1965. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3101785?seq=6#page_scan_tab_contents\n\nBecause he is undoubtedly a swell guy otherwise I will be focused. entirely on nitpicking parts of a couple of sentences, as is the way here. They concern the author's interpretation of a discourse written in 1594 by English mercenary Humfrey Barwick to was defending the effectiveness of firearms (the harquebus and musket) against the English longbow.\n\nHere's what the article says:\n\n&gt;Barwick only considered the point-blank effectiveness of the two weapons. The harquebus is best because it is the first to fire; the archers must still pull their bows. **While Barwick did not claim that the harquebus had an accurate range greater than 8-10 yards**, he assumed the same range for the bow and dismissed the greater rapidity of fire the bowman enjoyed by saying that the soldier with a harquebus need only put several balls in his piece to have greater fire power.\n\n-\n\n&gt;**One must keep in mind that Barwick constantly compared the weapons with a 12-yard range in mind.**\n\nBarwick didn't think firearms were accurate beyond 10 yards? Wow, for someone supposedly so supportive of the new weapons that definitely seems pretty damning. Maybe we should take a look now that a [full transcript of Barwick's work is online](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A05277.0001.001?view=toc)\n\nThe first passage we run into giving specific range values:\n\n&gt;But to the musket againe: The musketes are weapons of great force, and at this day, bothe with leaders and followers, much feared: for fewe or no Armours, will or can defend the force thereof, being néerehand, which is as well a terror to the best ar∣med, as to the meanest: **it will kill the armed of proofe at ten skore yardes, the common armours at twenty score, and the vnarmed at thirty skore,** being well vsed in bullet and tried powder.\n\nNow hold on here, thirty score is definitely a bit farther than 12 yards. And it does seem as though he might be making a subtle comparison to the maximum range of the bow given that's what his whole paper is about. But whatever, it's not a direct comparison and it doesn't say anything about accuracy so we'll let it slide. Perhaps these are only theoretical ranges anyways.\n\nIs he still only considering point-blank effectiveness here? Strangely enough maybe he is. [Sir John Smythe](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A12567.0001.001?view=toc) in his book repeatedly used the term \"point and blank\", Barwick commented on this and noted that he hadn't heard that term before and believes it means the same thing as \"point-blank\". Anyways here is how Smythe defines point and blank: \". . . the Mos∣quet ranforced and well charged with good powder, would carrie a full bullet poynt and blancke 24. or 30. scores.\" Smythe didn't think that anything would hit at this range but it seems that Barwick is maybe still talking about someone's definition of point blank range in the above passage, so good work.\n\nAnyways moving on for a couple of paragraphs we read this from Humfrey Barwick:\n\n&gt;And whereas it is set down, also by S. Iohn Smith that it is not méete, that any Harquebuziers should discharge or shoot, but within 8. 10. or 12. yards at the most. I wonder what manner of souldier that shold bee, that within pointe blancke of his weapon, be it musket or Harquebuze, that should misse the bredth of a trencher:\n\nAh, now we get into 8, 10, 12 yards thing, and we get the context. Barwick is responding to a claim by Smythe that musketeers are ineffective against charging cavalry beyond 8-12 yards. Naturally Barwick seems pretty dismissive of the claim, if not outright baffled by it and counters that a soldier would not miss a trencher at those distances. As an aside \"won't miss a trencher at 12 yards\" is definitely a claim that the harquebus had an accurate range greater than 10 yards, just putting it out there.\n\nmoving on:\n\n&gt;and these are my reasons which consis∣teth in two pointes. First as touchinge a good and skilfull Cannonier, notwithstandinge that his Cannon dooth recoyle, sixe or eight foote: hee will not faile the compasse of a yarde of his marke, beeinge within pointe blancke: **Secondly the fowler, who dooth shoote without a rest many times, and hath his péece charged with small haile shot, if he be perfecte, wil not faile to kil a Mallard, (yea sometimes halfe a dozen if they sit néere together, or right vpon his leuell) within fiftie yardes. Then much lesse will the skilfull Harquebuzier or Muskettier misse the hit∣ting of a man:**\n\nAlrighty, now we're cooking. We've gone from not missing a trencher at 12 yards to not missing a man at 50 yards. That's definitely a claimed accurate range greater than 10 yards.\n\nWe'll skip ahead now past his description various times where he describes seeing both bows and firearms in action, from his early years as a soldier in the 1550s when his commanding officer held a trials 2-3 times per week involving \"all manner of warlike weapons\" to various battles he'd taken part in. I suspect that some of these may have taken place at ranges much farther than 10 yards as well, but lets move on to the 9th discourse where he really starts comparing firearms to bows:\n\n&gt;But this is the effect of the matter. If it must be as Sir Iohn Smith dooth say, that a Harquebuze may not discharge but within 8. 10. or 12. yardes: I think that if that be allowed, that the Harquebuzier may discharge the first, before the Archer, being rea∣dy as afore is said. And if it be at horsemen and the horsemen be so néer as within 10. or 12. yards: then is it too late to charge again, or to shoot, for the hors∣men being so néer as aforsaid, wil either enter or els immediatly retire, with y they haue already recei∣ued: for it is a thing most certain, that horsemen in their charge if they be Souldiers, when they are within danger of the shot, will either not charge at all, or else being neer, will with all possible speed per∣fourme their charge:\n\nA ways into this section here's a paragraph finally that actually seems to fit the original article's claims. If the discourse consisted of only this paragraph without anything else then yeah I guess the article would be a pretty good summary. Just ignore everything past the first two sentences where he seems to allude to the absurdity of a scenario where a gunman or archer is that close to a charging horseman.\n\nNext:\n\n&gt;The Harquebuzier that dooth perfectlye knowe how to vse himselfe and his weapon: will discharge more Bullets, then any Archer can doo Arrowes: and by this way and meane. If it be a Musket, so much the better for my purpose, and this is to be doone in great incounters, whereas armies cannot marche but easilye, for that the numbers are great, and being a Musket, **I would firste deliuer a single Bullet, at 24. score off** or there abouts, by that time they had marched fourescore neerer, I would deliuer another Bullet, and at 12▪ score two, and at eight score three, at forescore 6. Pistoll Bullets, with lesse pouder thē at the first by the third part, for alwaies the more lead the lesse pouder, and yet shall the force be neuer the lesse.\n\n&gt;**Now consider, that betwixt eight score and the ioyning of the battell, how many arrows can a bow well deliuer?** for within that distance, both the bat∣tailes dooth come on with great speede, or else not at all. But no man can tell how to fight, but as the time, the ground, and the number shall either giue leaue or suffer.\n\nNow we get a description of Barwick's proposal for a more \"realistic\" imaginary battle. At this point he's cooled down from 30 score slightly but he's still pretty clearly comparing bows to muskets at ranges much farther than 12 yards. In fact the the shortest range he mentions shooting his musket at here is 80 yards. This assumption that he's thinking about everything in terms of extremely short ranges pretty clearly doesn't hold up. Assuming the \"near shooting\" comparisons in his mind are taking place at around 50 yards or more actually causes his claim that the bow shoots \"by guess\" and the firearm shoots \"by rule\" to make more sense. Because it starts to become more important for the bow to estimate range than firearms at a distance.\n\nBut this is all still sort of implied isn't it? How accurate does Barwick claim the arquebus is really? Well:\n\n&gt;And wheras it is further set downe in the same Booke, that Harquebuziers may not giue their vol∣lyes of shot, but within 8. 10. or 12. yardes, and not 8. 10. or 12. skores: &amp; that archers will hurt, wound, gall and sometimes kill, at 9. 10. and 11. skore, as well as the fiery weapons can doo.\n\n&gt;To this I say, that for triall thereof, **I will stand at six score yardes distant** from the best of these Ar∣chers aforesaid, and let him shoot 10. arrows one af∣ter another at me, and if I doo stir from the place, let me be punished, and I wil be armed as before is said of the Pistoll proofe, and if I be therwith wounded, I am contēted to take my mends in my own hands: **and againe, let me be set in the same place** where this lustie Archer stood to shoot his ten arrowes, **and let there be a whole complete armour set right vp where I did stand**, and **let me haue but two shootes with a Musket or Harquebuze,** and let it then ap∣péere, what the one and the other is in force or cun∣ning, this in my opinion were no harm: and it were not amisse that triall were made, for it is supposed by many that haue read Sir Iohn Smiths booke, that there néedeth no Pikes to garde the Archers, for saith he, they are Pykes good enough of themselues.\n\nSo there you go, 6 score or 120 yards being the maximum range he thinks he can reliably hit a man-sized target. But hey, being off by a factor of 10 isn't really that bad is it?\n\nEdit: Back to the original article. It claims Barwick said that an expert \"with a harquebus could discharge only once every 40 seconds\". Can anyone tell where exactly Barwick says this? In the first discourse he mentions an instance where he offerered to demonstrate shooting 40 times in one hour with an arquebus, which would be one shot every 90 seconds. There's also maybe some statements you can reverse engineer to get rate of fire (he says that a musket can be reloaded in the time it takes the enemy to *march* 80 yards or in the time it takes them to *row* 160 yards while the arquebus can be reloaded in the time it takes them to *row* 80 yards), but he doesn't seem to come out and say \"40 seconds\" exactly.",

        "text": "Greeting Badhistoriers! I apologize for the great length of time since my last review, but full-time work (which thoroughly agrees with me) and Dragon Age Origins has occupied much of my attention. Still, the occasion has come where I must complete my review of Ancient Black Ops, Episode 6: The Varangian Guard, suggested by the bountiful u/Claidheamh_Righ:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUCxmAO4CJU\n\nMy bottle of imaginary Brännvin is with me, so let us continue!\n\n19.05: Man killed with obviously blunt re-enactment spear. DRINK!\n\n19.23: The academic says that the reign of Basil II was seen as a golden age, in no small part thanks to the guard. I disagree with that. The Varangians certainly helped Basil II keep his throne (and his part-time ophthalmologist business), but it was a combination of Basil's own abilities and the organizational structure of the Empire itself (along with a codified military tradition) which allowed for such a period of expansion and stability. DRINK!\n\n19.42: Narrator provides incorrect location for a US state. The area was also ravaged not by Basil II, but by internationally reviled war criminal, instrument of Northern imperialism and future combustible tank William Tecumseh Sherman. DRINK!\n\n20.01: The academic states the Varangians held the empire together. Absolutely not. It was the strong administrative structure and the Byzantine army itself WHICH HELD THE DAMN EMPIRE TOGETHER! DRINK!\n\n20.02: Okay, this one is the rare quadruple-mistakes. A warrior is doing a Hollywood dual-wield, one of the swords is blatantly blunt, he jumps in the air like as though he thinks he is in a Chinese wire-fu movie and HE DOESN'T EVEN HIT HIS OPPONENT. DRINK! DRINK! DRINK! *BRIEF LAPSE INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS* DRINK!\n\n21.45: Obviously blunt sword. DRINK!\n\n22.27: The episode keeps asserting that the Varangians were coming from Scandinavia. Certainly many men originated from Scandinavia, but there were also very large numbers of Rus (who are distinctly not Scandinavian) and, after the Norman Conquest of England, Anglo-Saxon warriors. DRINK!\n\n22.54: Narrator states Harald Hadrada took the Varangian Guard to a whole new level. How? Did he introduce power-metal? The Varangian Guard was part of an *integrated* military establishment with a *centuries old* martial tradition. Harald was a country bumpkin who could contribute nothing, tactically speaking. DRINK!\n\n23.02: This posing makes me wonder if Viking glamour shots were used in applications to the Byzantine army.\n\n23.13: Another reference to Harald being the proto-typical Viking 200 years after Vikings actually started raiding. DRINK!\n\n23.30: This medieval manuscript shows us how Olaf was disarmed.\n\n23.56: The narrator states the Rus were Vikings. No, Vikings were raiders from Scandinavia. The Rus were, curiously enough, just Rus. DRINK!\n\n24.04: ALL HAIL THE GRAND PRINCE OF SWAGGER!\n\n25.28: I'm not sure cars, passenger ferries, telephone poles and Islamic minarets were present in Constantinople in the 11th century AD. DRINK!\n\n26.04: The academic says, in the one sentence, Harald was reliable, and yet created alliances and truces and then broke them. Did they not have at least *one* intern to double-check the script?\n\n26.06: This hero-worship of Harald is seriously annoying. Yes, he earned high rank and accomplished much in the Varangian Guard, but he was hardly the protagonist of a Pathfinder RPG session. He was just *one* distinguished actor amongst many in the Empire. DRINK!\n\n27.56: More Harald-worship. The episode is making out as though Harald is the lead figure in the invasion of Sicily. In actuality the expedition was commaned by George Maniakes and Harald, though apparently a senior figure, was hardly the key individual responsible for the conquest. DRINK!\n\n28.05: GAH! The narrator says the Arabs of Sicily decided to remain in their fortress because of the Varangian Guard. The Varangians were only a small component of the expedition, and the military tactic the Arabs practiced was a standard one when confronting a larger army: remove all possible supplies from the country and let disease and hunger reduce the enemy force. DRINK!\n\n28.30: \"Castles, fortified towns actually were rarely taken\". Except for all the times they were. DRINK!\n\n29.23: More Harald-worship. The narrator states that, to capture a fortress, Harald has to devise something new. Again, the Byzantines had a full siege capability already. Stone-throwers, towers, mining, counter-fortifications. The Byzantines had it all, and Harald could teach them *nothing*. DRINK!\n\n30.02: GAH! The episode states it was Harald's idea to dig a tunnel under the walls of the city. GAH! THIS WAS STANDARD MILITARY PRACTICE IN THE REGION! DRINK! BREAK STUFF!\n\n31.29: \"All I said was that Firefly was overrated and there was a good reason it got cancelled!\"\n\n33.08: The trick of being wanting to be buried in the church of the city makes for an interesting story, but I doubt the Arabs, with their own history of military subterfuge, were idiots. The account of this event can be read here:\n\nhttp://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Hardrada.html\n\nThe problem is, such a reference does not appear in Byzantine sources. Michael Psellos failed to mention it, or Harald, at all:\n\nhttp://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/basis/psellus-chrono06.asp\n\nI take issue with the episode taking what is essentially a Michael Bay equivalent of medieval entertainment at face value. DRINK!\n\n34.09: At this point I cannot take a drink as I am too busy vommiting in disgust.\n\n35.00: F#ck it. I'm sick of Harald and stopping the review here.\n\nSo, that was absolutely torturous. See you for the next review!\n\n\nSources\n\nThe Byzantine Empire, 1025-1204, by Michael Angold\n\nThe Development of the Komnenian Army 1081-1180, by John W.

You will also find Tiger-Wanking and \"Muh Samurai Spirit\" but that's not the focus of this post.\n\nInstead, the focus is on this particular gem of idiocy.\n\n&gt; \"The scientists and engineers in the US and UK wasted their time with \"pointless\" things like discovering penicillin\" and inventing nylon -- inventions that would only find military applications after the war was over.\n\nPenicillin is one of the single most important discoveries in the 20th century, I would be hard pressed to find a single more idiotic statement than \"Penicillin is useless\". Penicillin was a game changer in every possible way in the treatment of diseases. \n\nThe other statement, that \"[Penicillin] only find military applications after the war was over\" is also absurdly wrong. While Penicillin was only widely available to civilians post war. The US and UK spent great deals of resources in mass producing Penicillin during the war. The first patient was treated with Penicillin on March 14, 1942, and production ramped up soon after.\n\n&gt; \"During the war, the armed forces received 85 percent of the nation's production, which amounted to 231 billion units in 1943. With the implementation of successful mass-production techniques, 1,633 billion units were produced in 1944 and 7,952 billion units in 1945. Penicillin became the war's \"wonder drug,\" and its remarkable medical effects on infectious disease made World War II different from any previous war.\"\n\n(one dose was 100,000 units, so in dosage, the production numbers were 2.3 million in 43, 16.3 million in 44, and 79.5 million in 45)\n\nIndeed, the ready availability of Penicillin to the Western Allies was one of their great advantages. Battlefields and Military Hospitals are dirty places, and wounded soldiers had a very high chance of catching an infection either in the field, or more commonly in the hospitals. Applied in a preventive manner, Penicillin greatly reduced the chances of soldiers dying from wound-related infection.\n\n&gt; The difference in infection rates in patients treated with penicillin and sulfa powder versus sulfa powder alone was remarkable (17 of 184 [9.2%] in the penicillin and sulfa powder group; 10 of 32 [31.2%] in the sulfa alone\ngroup).\n\nNot only was Penicillin useful in treating wounds, it was also extremely effective against Pneumonia, a common killer in the harsh winter. Post war studies concluded that Penicillin reduced the mortality rate of bacterial pneumonia from 80% to just over 17%.\n\nIn short, everything about the quote in the OP was wrong. Penicillin is not useless, and it was most definitely available and effective during wartime.\n\nSources\n\nPenicillin Production\n\nhttp://www.lib.niu.edu/2001/iht810139.html\n\nCombat infections and mortality rates\n\nhttp://afids.org/publications/PDF/CRI/Prevention%20and%20Management%20of%20CRI%20-4-%20-%20History.pdf\n\nThe effect of Penicillin on Pneumonia\n\nhttp://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/2/234.full\n\nEdit : Feel free to Badhistory the rest of that post in the comments, because god damn there is a lot of it.",

        "text": "So I stumbled upon [this... thing](http://imgur.com/gallery/iFGL9) which is all well and good, understanding other viewpoints is important.  The second section sort of rubbed me the wrong way though.  I'm not a historian, I just enjoy history as a hobby and something about this struck me as wrong so I did a bit of research, please let me know if I made any mistakes.\n\nHere is the text in question:\n\n&gt;Belief: - The founders believed Americans needed to have arms, to 1) Defend themselves from each other, and 2) Defend themselves from a tyrannical government. The idea that a democratic government can never become tyrannical is naive and ignores historical evidence proving otherwise. - The notion that they wanted musket-loading weapons only for a Militia is blatantly thrown out the window once you analyze historical context. - Rapid fire weapons existed during the signing of the Constitution and the Founders knew about them, and Jefferson even once approved of a private ship owner's right to place a cannon on his ship for self defense against Pirates. - Besides, when George Washington put down the Jay's Rebellion, do you think he went back to Washington and advocated to take away our guns after seeing how dangerous an armed rebellion was? No. He knew it was their natural right and that the Government had to realize that they firstly must serve the people, or face a group of armed, angry people.\n\nSo let's dissect this... thisness:\n\n&gt;- The founders believed Americans needed to have arms, to 1) Defend themselves from each other, and 2) Defend themselves from a tyrannical government. The idea that a democratic government can never become tyrannical is naive and ignores historical evidence proving otherwise.\n\nThis part seems fine, mostly speculation but nothing egregiously incorrect about it.\n\n&gt;- The notion that they wanted musket-loading weapons only for a Militia is blatantly thrown out the window once you analyze historical context.\n\nI'm assuming the author here means 'muzzle-loading' rather than 'musket-loading'.  The sentence itself is poorly worded in that it could either mean \"only muzzle-loading weapons are to be used by a militia\" or \"only militias are to use muzzle-loading weapons\".  Considering the [existence and fairly common use of breech-loading firearms in the 18th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breech-loading_weapon) it would be strange if the 2nd amendment was specifically referring to muzzle-loading weapons.\n\n&gt;- Rapid fire weapons existed during the signing of the Constitution and the Founders knew about them, and Jefferson even once approved of a private ship owner's right to place a cannon on his ship for self defense against Pirates.\n\nEDIT: u/Goatf00t [helpfully mentions the Giradoni air rifle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4zgx4o/the_history_of_the_second_amendment_according_to/d6vsxnj)  That's probably more what the author was referring to.\n\nHere is where we find the meat of the bad history.  At the risk of violating R2 the author is implying that the existence of any repeating weapon allows one to grasp the concept of all repeating weapons.  In that vein let's take a look at the 'repeating weapons' of the 18th century.  Using [this source](http://militaryhistorynow.com/2014/01/27/before-gatling-who-was-the-first-to-invent-the-rapid-fire-gun/) we find the closest one would be the 1791 'Nock Gun'.  A series of barrels grouped together that *looks* like a Gatling Gun but in actuality is a volley gun, firing all the barrels at the same time.  It was not exactly a massive leap forward in firearms technology:\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, the weapon suffered from some major flaws: not only was the recoil too powerful for a typical sailor or marine (especially when used by marines balancing aloft in a ship’s rigging), but the flaming remnants of paper cartridges that were belched out of the gun’s seven barrels were a tremendous fire hazard aboard a wooden ship with canvas sails. Also, since rifled muskets in the 18th Century were much slower to load than the smooth bore weapons of the day, the Nock could take nearly 10 minutes reload, effectively putting a sailor or marine out of action. Attempts were made to develop an easier to load, non-rifled version, but the recoil was still too powerful to make the gun practical.\n\nOkay, but what else is lying around?  The 'Puckle Gun' is next in the list.  It doesn't even have a date of service because it was found to be very impractical at best and the British Army never even bothered with it.  Not only do none of these really fit what we would think of today as a 'repeating firearm' they were also not terribly practical and unlikely to have been looked at as a serious device.\n\nAs to Jefferson approving private ship owners having cannons, I can find nothing confirming that, [the Jefferson foundation does point out how much he liked guns but makes no mention of this incident.](https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/firearms)\n\n&gt;- Besides, when George Washington put down the Jay's Rebellion, do you think he went back to Washington and advocated to take away our guns after seeing how dangerous an armed rebellion was? No. He knew it was their natural right and that the Government had to realize that they firstly must serve the people, or face a group of armed, angry people.\n\nJay's Rebellion sounds familiar but I can't seem to find any mention of it.  I assume the author means [the Whiskey Rebellion](https://www.ttb.gov/public_info/whisky_rebellion.shtml) but somebody might be able to point me to the right thing.  The Whiskey Rebellion, as mentioned in the above article, was a resounding success for the US Government and unlikely to make anyone see \"how dangerous an armed rebellion was\".  In fact, the article goes on to mention how \n\n&gt;While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax continued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes.\n\nmaking it less a poster child for armed rebellion and more a poster child for exerting political pressure.\n\nEDIT: u/kmmontandon helpfully directed me to *Shay's* Rebellion as a possible for the 'Jay's Rebellion' reference and I think that sounds much more correct so let's look at that.  [Here we've got a source about that](http://www.mountvernon.org/digital-encyclopedia/article/shays-rebellion/) and it doesn't exactly look better for the author than the Whiskey Rebellion.  For one this was another resounding success for the Government forces.  For two, Washington is quoted as saying,\n\n&gt;On the prospect of the happy termination of this insurrection I sincerely congratulate you; hoping that good may result from the cloud of evils which threatened, not only the hemisphere of Massachusetts but by spreading its baneful influence, the tranquility of the Union.\n\nwhich doesn't exactly seem like \"seeing how dangerous an armed rebellion was\".  Third, the rebellion is cited as a cause for the reforming of the Articles of Confederation which means it is partially responsible for creating a stronger Federal government rather than stronger individual rights.  Fourth, George Washington did not personally oversee the conflict, that honor instead going to General Benjamin Lincoln of the Continental Army.  Fifth, Washington DC would not be founded until three years *after* the end of the rebellion so it is unlikely Washington returned there from not going to put down the rebellion.",

        "text": "That popular game of nautical nonsense, World of Warships, has recently announced the addition of several Royal Navy ships to the game in an upcoming patch. As a massive fan of the RN, I of course had to search out details of this, and found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrUpEpgbos0) by Youtube's The Mighty Jingles. While it's a good rundown of the ships to be added to the game, it's full of bad history. \n\nOur first bit of badhistory comes at [5:00 minutes](https://youtu.be/lrUpEpgbos0?t=300) in, when discussing HMS Danae. (A transcript from the video follows)\n\n&gt; What I can tell you about the *Danae* is that in 1944 she was transferred to the Polish Navy as the ORP Conrad, and commissioned at a ceremony in the shipyard of Gdansk. Her Captain went by the name of Joseph Konrad Korzeniowski although he was more commonly known after WW2 by his penname of Joseph Conrad. \n\nThis contains two main inaccuracies. While *Danae* was transferred to the Polish Navy in 1944, this didn't happen at Gdansk. Gdansk was still under the control of the Germans in October 1944, when this transferral happened. Additionally, she wouldn't have been given over to the Poles at Gdansk even if it had been under the control of an Allied power for two main reasons. Firstly, the Germans still controlled the only routes into the Baltic from the North Sea, as they would hold Denmark and Norway right up until VE Day. This made it exceptionally difficult for the RN to operate within the Baltic - the only ships that did were blockade runners converted from fast motor gunboats. A cruiser wouldn't have stood a chance. Secondly, the only Allied power that could have captured Gdansk would have been the Soviet Union. They wouldn't have looked favourably on the transferral of an RN ship to the London-sponsored Polish government-in-exile occurring in a shipyard under their control. The Soviets had their own puppet Polish government, the Polish Committee of National Liberation, which they viewed as the only legal government of Poland. They wouldn't have wanted to legitimise the London Polish government in such a way. *Danae* was actually transferred to the Polish Navy at the British port of Portsmouth.\n\nThe second major inaccuracy is that Joseph Conrad had absolutely no involvement with HMS Danae. By the time *Danae* had taken his name, he had been dead for 20 years. He never served in either the Royal Navy or Polish Navy, spending his entire career at sea in the merchant marine. He had retired from this career in 1894, 22 years before HMS Danae was even laid down. \n\nThe second section to which I take objection comes when he discusses HMS Edinburgh, at about [11:45 minutes in](https://youtu.be/lrUpEpgbos0?t=702). \n\n&gt; Most of her duties involved escorting convoys to and from the USSR via the perilous North Atlantic Convoy Route, and it was while returning from one of these convoys that she was hit and sunk by a torpedo fired by a German U-boat.\n\nThis massively oversimplifies the loss of *Edinburgh*. Firstly, it implies that she was sailing alone when hit. In fact, she was escorting QP11, a convoy travelling the return route from Murmansk to the UK. Secondly, the submarine, U-456, hit her with two torpedoes, not one. Both struck on the starboard side, with one causing major flooding, and the other effectively blowing her stern off. However, despite the heavy damage done to her, she would stay afloat for two more days, from the 30th April 1942 to the 2nd May 1942. During this period, several British destroyers and minesweepers attempted to tow her back to Murmansk for repairs. However, on the 2nd, this operation would be interrupted by the arrival of three German destroyers. Her escort engaged them, as did *Edinburgh*, even though she was still effectively crippled. She managed to sink one, the *Hermann Schoemann*, but was struck by another torpedo, almost directly opposite her first torpedo hit. This scuppered all attempts to salvage her, with heavy flooding forwards, the power cut to the forward section of the ship, and her boiler rooms beginning to flood. Her crew was taken off, and she was scuttled by torpedoes from HMS Foresight.\n\nOur third inaccuracy comes at about [15:30 minutes](https://youtu.be/lrUpEpgbos0?t=924) in. Here, he's discussing the Tier X, which is HMS Minotaur. He correctly identifies that the ship Wargaming (WoWS's developers) have released screenshots of is not one of the ships so named that were actually completed, and nor is she HMS Newcastle (which he claims have been named *Minotaur* before the name-change - though actually this honour went to HMS Southampton). He then incorrectly concludes that \"Wargaming have made this one up\". This is incorrect. The *Minotaur* Wargaming are developing is a post-war design, planned as a replacement for the cancelled *Neptune* class from 1946. It was heavily inspired by the American *Worcester* class of cruisers, which had a heavy armament of 6in dual purpose guns. The design was to use a similar hull to the previously designed *Neptune*s, mounting five twin 6in turrets rather than the four triples on the *Neptune* class. The twin mounts to be used were the Mark XXVI mountings later used on the *Tiger*-class cruisers. Fully automatic, and theoretically capable of a rate of fire of 20 rounds/minute, they were an excellent dual-purpose mount, though somewhat affected by technical issues. Their secondary armament was to be eight twin 3in/70cal Mark VI mounts, again as later used on the *Tiger* class ( The gun was a joint American/British development, though both nations used their own designs for the mountings). The planned displacement of the *Minotaur* class was 15,280 tonnes, and a speed of 31.5 knots was planned. While they would have been very capable ships, they were also expensive. The weak post-war British economy could not afford such extravagant spending, and they were cancelled by 1949, (though as noted above, the work done on their armament was reused on the *Tiger*s). Their cancellation really marked the end of British all-gun cruiser construction - the *Tiger*s were a simple modernisation and completion of ships left uncompleted at the end of WW2, and while designs were forthcoming in the future, no more would be as heavily worked out. The final death knell to the British gun cruiser came in 1959, when the first missile armed County-class destroyers were laid down.\n\nThe fourth thing I feel is bad history comes at about [17 and a half minutes in](https://youtu.be/lrUpEpgbos0?t=1045), when discussing British heavy cruisers. While Jingles is correct that the RN only built three classes of heavy cruiser, this doesn't mean that Wargaming couldn't put together enough heavy cruisers to build a separate line. Firstly, the County class was composed of three separate sub-classes. While the differences were rather minor, it's possible that Wargaming could work with them - HMS London received a major refit, setting her completely apart from her sister ships, for example. Secondly, this ignores older British cruisers - the old armoured cruisers of the 1890s and 1900s. These ships have been included in the game before, with ships like the *St Louis*, a contemporary of the British *Duke of Edinburgh* and *Warrior* classes. Finally, it ignores several cancelled designs. The Atlantic Cruiser designs of 1913 represent a missing link between the older concept of the separate light and armoured cruiser to the post-war *Hawkins* class, arguably the first heavy cruiser. It'd be great to see one of them in game. There were also several designs for heavy cruisers produced during the war, with three main designs being produced in 1939, 1940 and 1941, all with nine 8in guns in triple turrets (though a 22,000 tonne monster armed with 12 9.2in guns was also investigated). The RN produced plenty of ships and designs that could fit into a heavy cruiser branch in WoWS, especially since Wargaming have shown themselves to be no stranger to paper designs.\n\nThe final thing I want to complain about comes throughout the video. There is a constant assumption that 8in/203mm guns are a better armament for cruisers than 6in/152mm guns. While this may be true in the game, it was not true in real life. The 8in gun had an advantage over the 6in in range and armour penetration. However, the 6in had an advantage in rate of fire, and in throw weight. A twin 8in turret could fit into the same amount of space as a triple 6in turret, so a ship with four turrets would have four extra barrels if armed with 6in guns over 8in. The typical rate of fire for a British 8in gun was 3-4 rounds/min, compared to 6-8 for a 6in gun. War experience showed that the range and armour penetration advantages of the 8in mattered little in real-life situations. The 6in could reach the limit of effective fire control - the longer range of the 8in gave little advantage, as its shells couldn't be accurately placed at such range. In any case, most battles were fought well within the range of the 8in, neutralising its advantage. There were very few targets sufficiently well armoured that a 6in gun couldn't penetrate, but an 8in gun could. However, I recognise that WoWS really doesn't represent naval warfare well, and so these factors may not be taken into account. Given this, it is possible that Jingles is correct within the narrow context of the game.\n\nSources:\n\n*Nelson to Vanguard: Warship Design and Development 1923-1945*, David K.

Some sources go as far as saying 30% were born overseas, but I digress.\n\nBasically, stop brushing them under the carpet because you didn't see them in Peter Weir's *Gallipoli*.\n\nNext up is the altogether worthier [*On Every Anzac Day* by John Schumann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXLL42oCFPI) which pays tribute to the Indigenous Australian contribution to World War I. It's a far more sensitive song with a far more important message, so I don't want to be too mean-spirited about it, but:\n\n&gt;From Murray Bridge and Mundrabilla, from Naracoote and Perth\n\n&gt;First Australian station hands, shearers, gangers, clerks…\n\n&gt;And there was no black, there was no white, just a dirty khaki brown\n\n&gt;And on our upturned slouch hat brims, we all wore the “Rising Sun”\n\n&gt;Soldiers, brothers, all Australians, we had no time for race\n\n&gt;When the bullets are whining past your head, you’re all just shades of grey\n\nNow this is true to a point. It's to their credit that Indigenous men signed up to serve in an army that actively excluded them. The Defence Act 1903 prohibited men not of European descent from enlisting (this was relaxed in 1917 to include men with one white parent) but some persevered and 946 served in total, with 770 serving overseas. Enforcement of the Defence Act varied from recruiting station to recruiting station and the records are a particularly dispiriting read, filled with barely coded racism and \"half-castes\" being preferred over the \"physically unfit.\" \n\nEnthusiastic press reports also attest that recruitment of Aboriginals was used as a propaganda device, designed to shame white Australians into enlistment (\"loyal half-caste\", \"patriotic natives\", \"it was a crying shame that any [white men] should be taught their duty by dependants of an aboriginal mission.\"), while more structural racism can be found in the the mandatory declaration of 1917 onward that the recruit had \"associated with white people all my life.\" \n\nThere's even an example of Indigenous men being enlisted into the Australian Light Horse, given uniforms, paraded down the street on horseback for the press and then immediately discharged and sent home under police escort.\n\nAt an institutional level there was plenty of \"time for race\", then, but what about the frontline?\n\nIt's also true from primary sources that many found a level of camaraderie in the trenches that they hadn't experienced with their white neighbours at home, but this displacement of the truth with the egalitarian ideal of mateship is, I'm afraid, Anzackery in itself. Ultimately, mateship wasn't an implicit quality afforded to every Australian, it was something that Indigenous Australians had to earn.\n\nCaptain J Sydney Bartlett of the 11th Australian Light Horse wrote in 1933 of his WWI experience:\n\n&gt;In the early days of the war they were looked upon by many officers and diggers as being undependable under heavy fire, but this opinion was soon brushed aside after the hard fighting in Palestine, and the Aboriginals received the respect of all their fellow diggers.\n\nThis respect was heavily qualified in racial terms. In one instance it referenced the paternalistic imperialism of Kipling's *Gunga Din* with two Indigenous soldiers complimented as \"jolly fine fellows and white, clear white inside.\" A similar accolade was handed to William ‘Mick’ King in [a 1931 letter to a veteran's journal](https://indigenoushistories.com/2013/06/05/william-mick-king-and-the-position-of-aborigines-in-the-aif/): \"Although he was black he was a White man and a dinkum [true] Aussie.\"\n\nit's worth adding that occasionally you see the phrase \"integrated units\" the idea that Indigenous servicemen weren't subject to different rules as evidence of the egalitarian ethos of the AIF. This is a bit of a false dawn if you recall that the premise of the Defence Act is that all of these men are assumed to be white Europeans. (Plus there's at least one example of a commanding officer insisting on his Indigenous men being refused alcohol in England under Australian legislation prohibiting its sale to Aboriginals). \n\nEdit: Got confused about where India is.",

In this case, [close to the beginning](https://youtu.be/j1vnv2cICCM?t=39s) of the video, the narrator claims that they’ll “be using only tools and techniques from the 19th century.” I’m a big fan of the Man At Arms series, but badhistory is badhistory, and as such, it should be called out.   \n\nSo, the moment I saw [what is most definitely an oxy-acetylene torch](http://imgur.com/a/Eql0u) in the hands of one of the weapon smiths, my eyebrows rose.  \n\n[According to Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxy-fuel_welding_and_cutting)   \n&gt;French engineers Edmond Fouché and Charles Picard became the first to develop oxygen-acetylene welding in 1903.\n\nSince oxy-acetylene welding itself was developed in the 20th century, I highly doubt that anyone would've used an oxy-acetylene torch for cutting in the 19th century. (Although you're free to correct me if I'm wrong about that) However, the smith goes on to [reassure us](https://youtu.be/j1vnv2cICCM?t=4m19s) that it’s still somehow legitimate, because a German inventor invented the first blowlamp in the 1790s. Well, it’s still flawed to compare an ~~oxy-fuel~~ oxy-acetylene (Edit: yeah, oxy-fuel torches can use liquid fuels too) cutting torch to these early blowlamps, because early blowlamps would use a [liquid fuel and air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blow_torch) instead of the gaseous acetylene fuel and pure oxygen used by an oxy-acetylene torch, which reaches much higher temperatures on combustion and requires more advanced technology.\n\n(Edit: as /u/Feragorn [mentioned,](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/4z3bld/in_which_man_at_arms_claims_that_theyll_use/d6sl2vv) the smith also [claimed that](https://youtu.be/j1vnv2cICCM?t=5m18s) he wouldn't use belt sanders or grinding wheels, although both of them are 19th century tech too.)\n",
