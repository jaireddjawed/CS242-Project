        "text": "When i think about the books that i got to read as a child, i remember that many of them Had death as a topic. They featured characters dying and describing the process of dying (Like how the breathing slows down and then becomes stronger again and you hope that they will make it but nope, they will die) or even children dying and their death coming fairly unexpected (Like Jostein Garder's \"Through a Glass darkly\", or \"Oscar and the Lady in Pink\") some of those were Picture books written for kindergardeners.\n\n\nI remember that even when i was still in Kindergarten, i sometimes lied awake at night and pondered upon my own mortality. That i was going to die eventually and then i would Just cease to exist.\n\nGiven that the very Young audience is treated like idiots by the media most of the time, why is children's Literature so determined to make sure that Kid's are introduced to death and the consequences of death so early on?",

Did you ever hear a blind man won't smoke because he can't see the smoke come out?\" \"I don't believe it.\"\"I think it's all bull, myself;\" he said. \"I just heard it somewhere. You know how you hear things.\"\n\nI inmediately recognized it from Carver's Cathedral: \n\n\"I remembered having read somewhere that the blind didn’t smoke because, as speculation had it, they couldn’t see the smoke they exhaled. I though I knew that much and that much only about blind people\"\n\nI found it funny, considering Carver disliked comparisons with Hemingway, but it's the second reference to him I've found (the other arguably  being the title \"Would you please be quiet, please\" a reference to Hills like white elephants, \"Would you please please please please please please please stop talking?\").\n\nAnyone know any other references?",

So far the only poems I've read are either \"Free Verse\" or \"Metered Verse\" it seems to focus more on \"Aesthetics\" as opposed to narrative. Bare in mind I am not that well-versed in poetry, hence I am still discovering and learning.",

        "text": "Hello, this is part of a larger idea I was thinking about with modernists and water (not saying Hemingway was a modernist, but he’s part of the modernist story) but I just wanted to talk about the use of water in A Farewell to Arms. First of Hemingway is obviously involved in the idea of water as a literary device and a strong symbol the the cycles of life, the epigraph of The Sun Also Rises is:\n\n “The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to the place where he arose… The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits… All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come thither they return again.”\n\nNow this is an idea we see in modernist works from Whitman’s *Out of The Cradle, Endlessly Rocking*, to what is essentially the culmination of modernism, *Finnegans Wake*. The latter is all about cycles in concept and begins and ends with passages about water being the embodiment of cycles. But I digress, A Farewell to Arms has a strong cyclical component to it that may not be it’s seminal point but is the result of it reflecting the reality of a cyclical world. Aside from the grotesque cycles of wars, Catherine loses her finance to in turn be lost to her finance. (I also see the constant opening of the novels “books” with “In season x we lived in y” as a cyclical device.) As we’ve already seen water is the embodiment of cycles in many works and in A Farewell to Arms we see it used heavily. Fredric’s most important moment (arguably) in the novel occurs when he jumps in the river in a kind of baptism of saying a farewell to arms. Water further brings them across into Switzerland and to both paradise and death in a river styx like manner. I really saw the whole novel as a study in the grim cycle exemplified by the perpetual deaths of lovers it contains and the constant senseless death, but with the caveat that within all this support for the idea that life is “nasty, brutish, and short” (to quote Hobbes) there is this real intense love and I think though it is borne of trauma this love that the characters do manage to attain is a real overlooked part of the novel and is not just included to make the ending harsher.",

        "text": "*The Passenger* and *Stella Maris* got me thinking about companion novels and how they (at least in my awareness) are a rarity. The idea of two novels, in the same world or framing, similar style, but with their own plots and characters sounds fascinating. It's not a sequel or prequel, but it's own story that in some way sheds light on, informs, or elevates the other in their shared theme or style. \n\nI thoroughly loved *The Passenger*, it's one of my top reads of the year and now I'm wondering what other examples of companion novels are there, and what should I read? I've been looking around and a **lot** of the examples I can find are within the romance &amp; YA genres. And looking, it can often be hard to distinguish between true \"companions\" and just sort of soft sequels.",
