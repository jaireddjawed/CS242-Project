        "text": "Hey guys, I've been trying to find a good pathway to get into condensed mathematics. I'm familiar with category theory and topos theory, although from a logical background, I have some knowledge about internal logic of categories, classifying topoi, ETCS set theory, etc. I've also taken a course on algebraic topology. However, I feel that my background is a bit lacking if I were to start reading on condensed mathematics.\n\nI've found lecture notes on it online, but since I'm in the wrong area of category theory, I feel like I should read more on some prerequisites first. Is there a good way to get into it, without covering two or three whole areas?\n\nFor example, I can grasp the concept of a condensed set, but when I read about condensed groups, my intuition breaks, and I don't want to just take it 'on faith' that it's \"like a condensed set, but a group\".\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

Do you think it would be a gaussian curve centered around atomic time? Can you think of any extenuating factors that could cause the plot to deviate from a gaussian curve?\n\nSome people set their clocks a little bit forward so that they always arrive early, but that's kinda just a watch thing, not a phone thing because phones set their own clock. A lot of people that set the clocks on their non-internet devices tend to set the clock to the time their phone says, and when they do, their non-internet clock will be slightly behind because there's always some number of seconds that have passed when they reference their phone, but when they set the time on the non-internet device, it starts it at 0 seconds.\n\nCan you think of any other factors that would come into play?",

In particular, I wanted to model some theory regarding negotiation, as theorized in this paper: https://inp.harvard.edu/files/internationalnegotiation/files/relational_identity_theory.american_psychologist.pdf\n\n**Screenshot:** https://i.postimg.cc/Gt5cSrpJ/Screenshot-2023-02-23-163403.png\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Regarding my modelling of the paper:\n  *  It seems worthwhile to mention that \"Relationship Identity\" has two primary motives. However, it seems a bit bloat-y to write down the product in full (including the canonical projections). Why keep it / not keep it?\n  * I use \"relation\" and \"relation'\" to model that \"action tendency\"s can change the relationship from A to B. This seems a bit clunky though - could \"action tendency\" also be a transformation from \"relation\" to \"relation\"? Would it make sense to model \"action tendency\"s as objects in their own category?\n  * There are two more aspects I want to model: The concept of conflict (which is when a *perceived* relational identity diverges from the *desired* relational identity) and possible interventions that change the relational identity in a desired way (which is 4 sub steps of the \"action tendency\" \"collaboration\").\n   * How to model condition? (\"Conflict happens, when ...\")\n   * How to model sequences and sub categories (4 consecutive step, that are part of an \"action tendency\")\n\nI am also grateful for input in general!",

This year, I'm taking Physics C Electricity &amp; Magnetism and am at an all-time low in my academic career. I kid you not, on the most recent test I think I got a raw 20 when I normally get 80-95 in mechanics. I don't know if it's a combination of senioritis or me just exhibiting symptoms of brain damage as usual but as far as I'm aware, one that is strong in math should also be strong in calculus-based physics, right? I took Calculus BC last year and didn't have as hard a time as I am with E&amp;M. I don't know wtf is wrong with me at this point. I'm certainly not looking forward to taking physics as part of my gen-eds in college even as a math major. Fuck me",

I need to relearn it up to at least Calculus I before I could go to school.\n\nEngineering Mathematics looks like a real solid resource, although I've heard its more of a method book and doesn't provide a very intuitive understanding (though I'm not sure that would be too necessary). There's an online personal tutor included that provides a wealth of practice problems, too. I prefer reading to videos so that's why I'd rather do this that Khan Academy.",
