Just like mathematics, theoretical grammar uses abstract symbols and formulas to describe the rules and structures of language. It involves analyzing the patterns of sounds, words, and phrases, as well as the ways they are combined to create meaning.\n\nIn fact, there are many areas of theoretical grammar that involve mathematical concepts and techniques, such as formal language theory, which studies the properties of languages as formal systems. Other areas of theoretical grammar, such as syntax, semantics, and phonology, also use a range of abstract and formal methods to analyze and describe the structures and rules of language.\n\nMoreover, like mathematics, theoretical grammar requires precision, logic, and attention to detail. It involves the use of complex terminology, symbols, and diagrams to express concepts and relationships. Therefore, it is not surprising that some people find theoretical grammar just as challenging as mathematics.\"",

Regarding the program, I have a couple of questions.  \n\n\nFirstly, according to your website, it is required to have English skills at Level B2. Does this mean that I need to have passed B2 in each part of the Cambridge English First (FCE-B2) exam or is it enough if I just have a B2 certificate overall? There is a result of my English certificate in the attachment.\n\nSecondly, I would like to know if I am obliged to do the entrance exam at the Economics University in Novi Sad in Serbia where I am currently studying. The date for the exam is still unknown. However, it should take place between June and July.\n\nFinally, could you please tell me how much time I have for the motivation statement?\n\nThank you in advance for your help.  \nYours sincerely,",

In neuroscience, we call this a critical period or a sensitive period. And we have this for our eyes, but we also have it for our ears. And one of the most striking examples of this is that any human can essentially grow up in a culture where they hear different speech sounds from one language to another, and it's like after a couple of years, you lose sensitivity to sounds that are not part of your native language and you have high sensitivity for the languages of your native culture. And that's pretty extraordinary, that human brain has that flexibility yet, at the same time, has that specialization for language. And so we were trying to think about how do we model this, for example, in rodents, who obviously don't speak, but we're **just** understanding how sounds and environmental sounds modulate and organize the auditory cortex. And one of the things that we found that was quite striking was that if you basically mask environmental sounds from these rat pups, the critical period, this sensitive period where it's open to plasticity, it's open to change, it's open to reorganization, that window can stay open much, much longer. And in one way, it sounds like that's a good thing, but on the other hand, it's also a retardation. It actually slowed the maturation of the auditory cortex. It was ready to close when these rat pups were really young, but by raising them in white noise, we found out that you could keep it open for months beyond the time period that it normally closes. And so I think one of the things it taught me was that it's not just about the genetic programming that specifies some of this sensitive period, but it's also a little bit about the nature of the sounds that we hear that help keep that window for the critical period open and closed.",

Maybe I'm having trouble identifying the syntactical roles of each part of the sentence... Wouldn't it make more sense for it to be \"That he was innocent was said by them\" even if it sound very robotic.\n\nCould you help me?",

        "text": "I hope this is the correct category. \n\nIs there any difference in pronunciation of the word \"increase\" depending on whether it's used as a verb or as a noun. I vaguely remember being taught that it ought to be pronounced with a /z/ when it's a verb, ie. /inkriz/, whereas it's pronounced with an /s/ when it's a noun, ie. /inkris/.\n\nOr maybe I remember those backwards, or maybe it doesn't even matter in colloquial conversation? Cambridge English dictionary (online) doesn't appear to distinguish between the two.\n\nMany thanks.",

That's fantastic. So we did bump into each other serendipitously back then, and, at the time, I was a medical student at UCSF **studying with** Mike Merzenich. In particular, I was studying how the brain organizes when you have patterns of sound. And in particular, we were studying the brain of rodents and trying to understand how different sound patterns organize the frequency representation from low to middle to high frequency maps in the brains of baby rodents. And one of the things that I was very interested in was trying to understand how the patterns of the natural environment, let's say the vocalizations of the environment that the rat pups were raised in, or just the natural sounds that they hear, how that shapes the structure of the brain. And one of the things we did was to try an experiment where we raised some of these rat pups in white noise, continuous white noise that was essentially masking all of those environmental sounds.",

(In any word that ends in “en”).\n\n3) Should the thing being talked about always have an s at the end for words that don’t end in en for plural version of words for people? Like the artist(s’) forums, the kid(s’) playgrounds, the fan(s’) shirts? OR can we say the artists’ forum, kids’ playground, fans’ shirt?",
