        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/8dq2yq/advice_needed_for_startup_whose_sole_developer_is/",
        "text": "Hey Software Engineering,\n\nI Kindly ask if you experienced developers can guide my team and I on the direction of our technology stack for a start-up idea we have.  \n\nI want to preface this I am a recent CS graduate with no “real-world experience”. Rather, I have cowboy-coded my way into learning software: \n\n- I first started with web development and actually learned how to host two websites by buying a domain, web server, and FTP-ing my files into the web server. \n\n- I then created Android program on my phone and failed when I couldn’t scale it and test it on other phones.\n\n- The last thing I built was an iOS application in Swift that a business uses consistently. \n\nWith all this, I am a cowboy-coder.  When I think of a solution that can be coded up, I set off to the races to learn and write it. I am aware of my lack of “development process” and Agile or waterfall or test suites. I build features on a per-need basis. I am asking the community for help  because I have all this control yet so little guidance.\n\nI am now set with a task. We are creating a product that heavily relies on web scraping and logging in to websites to access data. \n\nThere is a codebase written in Java EE and it is terribly old, outdated and it has lost its web-scraping functionality. So I, with my cowboy mindset, am using Python and Selenium and an EEL (js-python) server to prototype a solution.  Hopefully we get funded so that I may develop this thing with the help of senior engineers who have more experience developing solutions. I then will use a better framework or language like java or .net to scale this thing up, on per-need basis.\n\nMy code uses Python to get data from a website by:\n\n-1. Logging in with Selenium,\n\n-2. Clicking with selenium\n\n-3. Entering keys with selenium\n\n-4. And retrieving values with Selenium\n\nThen uses python to compare a couple of strings with a user inputted form which I receive with JavaScript.\n\nThis product is supposed to scale to handle 1000 transactions like this A SECOND. \n\nMy questions are: \nI am inexperience with software dev in general. How is my coding viewed by the senior software engineers? In my mind, all that matters to me is making a software solution. I will approach development practices on a per need basis.\n\nI know how “Slow” Selenium is when taking this approach, but this approach is all I know. Is this approach “okay” in the business world? \n\nWhat would be the best framework to use when writing the code? \nI'm thinking:\n\n-Java EE for the functionality of the product\n\n-Amazon AWS for my web services and database\n\nHow do I find people who know how to answer my questions? I’m hoping that this place is a good start.  I, unfortunately, cannot wait 5 years to get industry experience to “demonstrate” I can create this product. I know I can build it. \n\nConsider this analogy: in school, I was always told to follow certain results and I cowboy-coded my way to solution.  Because I lack \"real-world\" experience, I cowboy-created useful products that were simple but were a business-need. How do I parlay my cowboy knowledge into actually learning how to make a professional software suite that is respectable, secure, and maintainable.  I know I can learn this, I just don't know how. \n\nWhat books can I read?\nWhat resources can I use to understand the mind of a senior developer??? ",

I'm experienced enough to build functional applications, but there are some principles I still struggle with, especially those without hard and fast rules, such as SRP.\n\nMy current project includes a windows service whose job it is to read uploaded files, flag rows based on data patterns, then price up the job based on those flags and notify the uploader.\n\nI've been trying to follow the single responsibility as much as possible. To this end, a lot of the heavy lifting in the service is done by other classes, sat behind an interface. There are classes for:\n\nData access\nFile system I/O\nFile parsing\nFile writing\nEmailing\nZipping and unzipping files\nFlagging based on patterns\n\nI recently had to change this class because the pricing logic became a great deal more complex. I wanted to put some unit tests around it - it's pretty important - and I realised I couldn't without a great deal of difficulty because it would involve making mocks of all the above classes.\n\nI guess, therefore, that I have inadvertently created a god object, or at least a demigod object, and that \"pricing\" needs to be split into its own class. Right?\n\nBut this made me wonder: it would have been better for me if I'd spotted this earlier. Are there practical methods one can use to spot when a class has grown too big for its boots?",

        "text": "**What exactly qualifies as software engineering experience?**\n\n**Background:** After graduating from a 5 year program and receiving a BSeng, I've been working as a *Business Systems Analyst* at a large corporate telecommunication company for one year. My job is to understand business rules and processes, and automate the processes as much as I can.\n\nDuring my time working there, I've been independently developing a company-internal tool using PHP, Javascript (with a public webdev library) and my own schema in a larger relational database. It will combine add automation and centralised data to 2 related fields, and it may be used widely across the company. I will be using data from other schemas in the database, and perhaps other databases, to use in my tool.\n\n**Problem:** Going through my day I find myself uninspired to work, as I don't believe this is the job my degree trained me for. I feel like maybe I'm headed away from software engineering. By working this job, am I losing my educational advantage towards a real software engineering job, or is this valuable experience? Sometimes I'm not sure what a real software engineering job entails.\n\nThe company I'm working for is kind of in the 'dark ages' when it comes to automation and structured software/databases. This aspect excites me, as planning a large scale structure for the company would be great, but I do not have enough experience or confidence in my sills to consider this route at the moment. This kind of task, though, is what I'd consider something I was educated to do as a software engineer.\n\n**TLDR:** By automating business solutions, am I headed in the right direction if I want a job as a software engineer? What does a real software engineering job entail?",

I can think of some uses to it but I can't implement them and would like to hear your opinions. I read about the pattern in Head First DP but their example was almost trivial, I feel like the paint has an infinite set of states!",

Rather, at the core of it I'm a terrible problem solver. I try my hardest to gather all the important pieces of information and then write code, but every time I think I'm done and then jump into it, I come back to realize that I was god damn wrong and just end up wasting a lot of time trying to fix my mess. \n\nSo, how can I think like a good programmer? I imagine this is kind of tricky because it's going against my natural tendencies and years of bad habits, but I think I need to change my mindset or else I'll never progress. I am also not naturally very strong at logical thinking, so I guess I'll need to brush up on that too.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

        "text": "**Background**\n\nI'm a 28 (29 on 4/24) year old based in Michigan making around ~60k annually. I'm married and have 2 young children (one is about 2 years old, and one is about 4 years old). I acquired a bachelor's degree in fine art (BFA) in 2011, majoring in Illustration. I mainly got this degree since I was a heavily unmotivated student in high school and mainly just showed some aptitude for art. I was a lousy kid, too focused on being in a band, hanging out with friends, and those sorts of things.\n\nHowever, I've been working full time as a web developer for the past 5 years. While working at this current job, I sort of found a new appreciation and love for programming / coding / hardware tinkering. I've also done several programming/development and personal projects on the side while working full time. [I also had the awesome opportunity of doing an artist-in-residence program, creating art in virtual reality, with Google's Tilt Brush team in 2016.](https://www.tiltbrush.com/air/artists/jimmy-gray/)\n\nSince around early 2015, I've been pretty consumed with side projects that involved various hardware / consumer product invention ideas that I've prototyped. None have been brought to market, but I have had some press written about some of these projects (like [here](https://www.roadtovr.com/vive-tracker-used-create-pressure-sensitive-photoshop-stylus-vr/), and [here](https://uploadvr.com/homemade-knuckles-controller-open-sourced/)). I have been heavily focused on projects such as these, hoping that I could maybe kick start a successful business based on one or more of them, and as a result sort of have a shortcut path to a greater income.\n\nLately, though, I've been realizing more and more, as a father and someone with less of a technical foundation, that I think it'd be wiser to try and get a STEM-related graduate degree (specifically in computer science, software engineering, or computer engineering) so that I could have more upward mobility, and a solid foundation from a career and financial perspective. I'm concerned that my current job is a dead end and that I can only get so far with my current background and expertise. I'm concerned about my kids' futures and my ability to provide for them. My dream job is working somewhere like a Google, working on cutting edge software / computer science stuff and working on cutting edge embedded programming for new hardware products.\n\n**Now what?**\n\nSo I was thinking about going to a really good graduate school in Michigan, like University of Michigan (Ann Arbor). UofM Ann Arbor has a high rated graduate computer science program. However, the acceptance rate is very competitive.\n\nSome of the problems I see are as follows:\n\n* My cumulative GPA at this point is a 3.0, and I'm not sure about my other scores (SAT, ACT), since they were so long ago and I haven't kept these records.\n* I'd have to go part-time since my family and I rely on my income, so I'm thinking 2 courses per semester would be manageable.\n* I'd have to take basic mathematics courses to probably even qualify for the program. I plan on taking these basic/preliminary courses at a local community college this year.\n\nWith my background, too, I'm not sure how I would attempt to recover in order to get accepted, and this is why I'm seeking advice.\n\n* Is there anyway I could realistically manage to get my GPA high enough in order to stand a chance at getting accepted?\n* Should I really target a less competitive graduate school? Would a less competitive school really be worth the money and time?\n\nThe University of Michigan Dearborn campus seems way less competitive and more affordable, but doesn't rank as high from what I can tell.\n\nI recently went to a college advisor for a local college (Wayne State University) and the advisor indicated that I could do an accelerated bachelor's and master's program part-time within 4 years. So I'd be around 34 when I were to graduate probably, and that seems to me to be around as far as I'd want to push things in terms of graduating later in age.\n\nThanks so much for your time in advance!",

        "text": "I'm an extremely tech and computer savvy person. I'm no master coder by any stretch of the imagination, however I have experience with HTML (the first iteration) and a very loose grasp of CSS. \n\nI have an idea for a very specific product, and I'm willing to learn to code in order to make it, so I'm curious to know about how long it would take someone like me to learn how to code the product I have in mind. A rough estimation would be fine. The product is essentially a modified version of the Virtual DJ software (obviously an audio software program that allows users to DJ music in a virtual turntable type environment). Basing my software off existing software leads me to believe there might be libraries or templates of code I could probably use to streamline the process, but Im not sure how something like that works, or how I would got about accessing them. Any suggestions on what language would be best to code in, as far as what would be best for audio programs? VDJ was created mostly in C++, it seems, so if there were libraries I might be able to use, Im guessing I should start there, but it also seems as if VDJ was coded in multiple languages, which is something I wasn't even aware was possible so... \n\nAnyway, the bottom line is, like I said, Im a fast learner, grasp basic coding concepts already, want to make a modified version of Virtual DJ, and would like to know if anyone has an estimate for a rough timeline of how long something like that might take, given that I also have quite a bit of the overall design and features and interface and such already kind of \"sketched out\" in terms of what it will do and how it will look and function, but a big drawback is that I'll definitely have to learn a programming language probably a few, in fact. \n\n\nCheers!",
