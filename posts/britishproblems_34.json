It may not seem like a lot to most but to me every penny counts. \n\nThey got back to me and apologied spouting some crap about how their new rates reflect current claim statistics blah blah blah. However they did surprise me by offering me a discount which would put my renewal down to £37 a month. I think car insurance companies just expect us to bend over and take it. I haven't made a claim in over 3 years so I don't see why I need to be shafted by these increase in prices. If anybody else experiences the same, don't stand for it kick up a fuss.",
