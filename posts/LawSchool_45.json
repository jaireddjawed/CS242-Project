As a result, whenever I show my resume or introduce myself to attorneys, they automatically assume I want to do sports or entertainment law (if they don't just openly wonder why I don't ditch law school and keep pursuing it).\n\nWhile I'm certainly open to it, it is not the only area I'm interested in (inclined towards litigation, possibly working as a prosecutor, but I am truly undecided).\n\nHow do I work around this without knowing exactly what else I want to do? Should I craft a better pitch for various things? Or should I maybe just lean into it? \n\nOne of the main reasons I'd be averse to sports/entertainment law is because breaking in seems incredibly difficult. Am I wrong about this?",

        "text": "\\*\\*BTW: this is not me saying Adderall does not provide benefits to anyone. There are plenty of people who need it. This is just my personal experience. \n\n...\n\nPrior to entering law school, all these prep books and wellness sessions raised the issue of substance abuse in law school. Of course it's prevalent in every profession, but the normalization of addiction in law school particularly is scary. It could come in the form of alcohol or cocaine. \n\nIn my case, it was Adderall.\n\nIt's been a year since my doctor prescribed me Adderall. Some of my friends had warned me of its side effects like depression or the crash. But I was already on Lexapro, and I brushed it off because I never felt depressed exactly when I took it. \n\nUnfortunately, foolishly, negligently, and unsurprisingly I did not take it as prescribed. I say unsurprisingly because of the stereotype that regrettably holds so true in that many law students tend to over-indulge in their preference of drug. For me, I was prescribed 20mg but took 40mg close to finals because \"I needed more to succeed.\" Of course, I absolutely got shit done. But was it worth almost losing my marriage and my personality? Absolutely not. \n\nThe damage it caused me was something I had never anticipated. I did not have in mind \"loss of personality among 1,000 other side-effects\" when I indulged in that drug. It changed the way I acted, the way I thought about everything. \n\nFirst, being creative is my defining characteristic, but that no longer existed when I took Adderall. I would creative write on a frequent basis but stopped because no creative thoughts came to mind. Conversations with everyone felt forced and almost inconvenient. I was a zombie with no energy. On top of that, I'm a distance runner and would run 5-6 miles after a long day. But I could never feel how tired I was, and that's partly what I loved about it. It kept me going off of 4 hours of sleep, and I did not have to eat that much. As someone with previous body issues, that was another reason I enjoyed the thrill of taking it. Looking back, I had no weight to even lose. But in the moment, I just loved how it kept me going and going, especially when much of the work involving law school is tedious. \n\nI could only imagine how tired my body really was. It was on overdrive on a constant basis for four months. By the end of the semester, my relationship with my husband was going downhill.  I became cold to him and unloving. I was a monotoned robot going through the motions, answering \"Yes\" and \"No\" to everything. It was draining on him, and I completely understand now. Except I could not grasp it at the time just how depressing it was for him or why he was down in the first place. The person he fell in love with was truly gone within those four months. He told me he no longer knew who I was anymore. \"You are not the woman I fell in love with a year ago,\" he said. \n\nI feel horrible. He would tell me that I was not \"there\" for him anymore. And only now that I am off the drugs, feeling like myself for the first time in such a long time, do I now know what he meant. Fortunately, we talked it all through and he accepted my apology. I just never want to put him through that again, and I certainly don't want to go through the motions everyday either. The short-term accomplished feeling and that  fully awake sensation was not worth jeopardizing my relationship nor was it worth my personality falling flat. \n\nI never realized its impact until a few days ago since I've been off of it for almost 3 weeks now. I am currently feeling emotions I forgot existed (e.g., things are funny again, I am so crazy about my husband, music sounds incredible, increased libido, etc.). I also never realized how depleted my dopamine levels are. My natural levels are returning now, and life has felt the best it's felt in so long. \n\nThis all has led me to see the bigger picture of what went wrong in my last semester, and that's that I did not believe in myself to complete work without Adderall. I was already suffering from severe imposter syndrome and was willing to do anything to make the journey easier, even if that meant taking an upper that I absolutely loved the feeling of. \n\nOnce the drug-abuse became bad, I no longer enjoyed taking it. But I took it anyways because of the pressure in law school to constantly be on your A-game. The drug instill this confidence in you that makes you stay in the zone for extended periods of time. You feel like you're going to outwork everyone and sometimes feel unstoppable. \n\nBut when I was off of it, I froze, unable to go about my day because I did not feel anything. I did not know how to get stuff done without it because that's how bad my dependency became. It was just so quick and convenient to pop one and feel that boost kick in exactly an hour later. \n\nI don't plan on going back on stimulants. I hate the person that I turn into when I'm on it. I'm thankful that I was able to stop after one semester and did not let it escalate or that my husband did not leave me. \n\nI know people are suffering from drug-abuse for years on end. It's a scary road. Praying for everyone out there .",

The starting salary is obviously not the 200k+ that big law is, but it isn't too far off (its over 150k without getting too specific). \n\nI was wondering what my day to day might look like and how comparable it will be to the stereotypical biglaw nature/lifestyle of the job. Does anyone know how salaries rise year to year, what a partner might make, and any other general differences that one might encounter working at what seems to be a strong midlaw firm.",

That said, if you had to make a curriculum for all 3 years rather than just the first, what classes would you mandate?\n\n\nI’ll go first -\n\n(Assuming as a 1L you take Civ Pro, Contracts, Property, Torts, Crim, ConLaw, &amp; LRW)\n\n2L: Admin Law, Fed Courts, Evidence, Crim Pro, plus some clinic/externship each semester and an advanced legal writing seminar\n\n3L: Professional Responsibility/Ethics, Business Organizations, Conflict of Laws, Trusts &amp; Estates, plus more clinic/externship and 3L-level legal writing\n\n\nI actually think this would be a decent schedule; you would cover a variety of bar topics &amp; classes that I see people generally describe as important; hone practical &amp; writing skills; and cap out at 2 doctrinals per semester. I grouped the courses the way I did because I think there’s some conceptual overlap that also might help make the schedule more bearable - Crim Pro &amp; Evidence, for example. (Disclaimer, I haven’t taken all of these courses so I’m operating off some word-of-mouth &amp; assumptions.)\n\n\nAgain, this obviously wouldn’t happen in the real world, but thought this was an interesting thought exercise and might be a nice change of pace from the various grade-related and 1L job-hunt posts.

        "author": "bonowasnopro",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/zwoa1a/looking_for_advice_on_mock_interview/",
        "text": "\nTLDR; title &amp; I feel like professor does not follow the department rubric likely designed to keep grades consistent for an inherently subjective assignment.\n\nI feel the need to preface this with a whole lot of info about the type of person I am because I don’t want to sound like I’m whining or unreasonable. I’m going to skip that for now and will address in comments if I need to.\n\nBackground\nFor my legal writing class we have to do mock interviews with an outside professor, not our legal writing professor. This past semester we had 2 interviews. We attend a 2 hour lecture with our assigned professor then the following week we have our interview. The interview is done in groups of 3. For both interviews I’ve been with two guys. \n\nGrading\nWe get oral feedback right after then a few weeks later we get a grade sheet back. There’s about 20 specific items on the grade sheet that say things basically like “student was prepared” or “student was empathetic towards client”.  Some are much more specific. Each item is graded with either an A, B, or C. As is our grade as a whole. The way this factors into our overall legal writing grade is complicated. Basically if there’s 100 points total that can be earned in the class a B will have no change to your grade. A adds 3 points. C subtracts 3 points. 6 points total can be added or subtracted for both interviews or it can have no impact on your grade at all. \n\nInterview 1\nGrade: B. Feedback afterwards mostly focused on my demeanor. Prof said things like; i was much more animated before the interview, too methodical, needed to relax more, I lacked empathy, but he liked the questions i was asking the client. my group members received less feedback that was more straightforward and did not address demeanor. I asked a number of questions at the end about the feedback because I wanted to understand what I needed to specifically change. Prof said something to the effect that he cant change our personality. I walked away wondering why he spent so much time on my feedback and wrote it off as maybe because I went first and he ran out of time for the other guys.\n\nInterview 2\nGrade: C. We were told during the lecture to explain something to the actor/client, when I employed this during the interview it triggered a number of questions from the actor and led to me getting off track. Fwiw the topic was very straightforward. The actor asked a ton of questions. During my feedback afterwards the actor chimed in to kinda defend me saying what I talked about was also talked about by students all last week in the interviews she did. The prof acknowledged maybe he didn’t explain well but waited to see if it was an issue with anyone else and said it wasn’t so he came to the conclusion it was me not him. \n\nAlso worth mentioning I’m friends with someone in the group that went immediately after me and they said they were asked two questions by the actor. This made me think maybe the actor was told to cool it on the questions after my group.\n\nOral Feedback afterwards was again related to my demeanor and tone. Prof said I was making great arguments but needed to be more confident and assertive. My fellow male classmate was told “normally I would tell you to be more confident and sit up straight but my buddy that has his own firm recently told me he does 95% of his client interviews on zoom so it doesn’t matter that much.”\n\nThe majority (2/3+) of items on my rubric were As/Bs but overall I got a C because of the one explanation that led to me getting side tracked. There was a comment on my grade sheet about keeping my eyes off my screen and I did not and absolutely would not have relied on a screen during the actual interview.  I met with the professor to discuss. In our 30 minute meeting he explained how he interprets the rubric. He talked the entire time and explained how basically it was that one thing that led to my grade. These are not recorded on video and he does not fill the rubric out during our interview. He makes notes and fills it out later.\n\nConcerns\nThese mock interviews continue throughout legal writing and I’m not that concerned about the one grade. I can always do better and appreciate constructive criticism especially when it comes to how I interact with people. My concern is more about the subjective nature of the assignment and the professor focusing on appearance rather than content. I feel like I would have to change how I outwardly express myself and the fact that I get nervous which is not something the university is coaching us through. It’s just not something you can learn during a 2 hour lecture. \n\nI’m an older student and I’ve never felt like I was being treated differently in a work setting. I know my awareness of being graded made me nervous. However, I’ve sat through a number of interviews and have done at least 20 public speaking engagements to groups of 10-100 people so this wasn’t completely out of my comfort zone. I was nervous but I’ve been way more nervous before. \n\nI vaguely addressed this in my course evaluation but avoided language even vaguely alluding to any kind of sexism. I don’t want to get anyone in trouble or make it seem like I’m just mad about my grade. I did see a number of comments in this professors past evaluations about him being unclear, having high expectations, and just not treating students well. I also over heard an upper level student expressing concerns over inconsistent grading between the different mock interview profs. \n\nI don’t want to talk to anyone in my class about this but I would like to express my concerns about this to someone I just don’t know who. I just feel like something needs to be said, I’m probably not the first person that’s felt like this.\n\nI don’t think it would be appropriate to address with my legal writing professor. My mentor was my professor this past semester and i think I have to wait to talk to her until after the grading period. Maybe the Dean of student services? \n\nAny advice or feedback is appreciated, thank you!!",

As of this morning, I officially locked in a post-grad job with a major insurance company.  The details of the job can be found on the original post.\n\nAfter taking into account a lot of advice from a lot of people on Reddit and IRL, I decided to ask the recruiter, \"Is this salary negotiable at this time?\"  A straight-up, yes-or-no fact-finding question.  I wasn't making a demand, I wasn't being aggressive, I just wanted to know.\n\nThe recruiter was extremely nice and explained that everyone hired into the 3L program is offered the same salary, so it was non-negotiable.  She also said that it *never hurts to ask* and that it was an important question, and to never be afraid to ask about it!  She also explained that the entire offer is standard and I'm not getting any credit for my previous experience in the field.\n\nThis advice, of course, comes with a caveat that I was working with a corporate recruiter, *not* a managing partner with an inflated sense of \"you're lucky I'm offering you a job.\"  If you feel like you're up against an ego like that, maybe *do* be afraid to ask - but also ask yourself if that's really someone you want to work for.\n\nOther updates from the recruiter include:\n\n* 20 days of PTO, not 24 -- I must have misheard her on the original call.  No big deal!  That's still a MONTH!\n* Bonuses are determined by the team managers (e.g., the Pennsylvania staff attorney managers)\n* I will be paying Philadelphia earnings tax (ouch)\n\nThanks for the advice from everyone (except the people who were nasty).  I hope this helps a few of you when you get your offers!\n\nCheers to the class of 2023!  We're almost done!",

        "text": "I’m 32 and considering a career change from software sales into law. I studied Political and Economic History as an undergrad, but then just fell into sales. \n\nI just took an LSAT practice test to get a baseline of where I’m at and scored a raw score of 48, which I think is a scaled score of 155?\n\nI didn’t really apply myself in my undergraduate studies, and my GPA is wellllll below a 3.0. I was playing a D 1 sport and was injured, and fell into a spiral of bad choices for my last two years of college. To say I didn’t apply myself would be an understatement.\n\nI know am extremely motivated and really want to pursue a career in law. My goal is to get a PowerScore tutor for the next 20 weeks, and take the LSAT in June. I follow politics religiously and keep up with Supreme Court cases, so even though I understand constitutional law isn’t where the money or height careers are, I think that is the law path I would want to pursue. At the very least, I know what type of law I DONT want to pursue (real estate/ music/ injury/ I’m making this up.) \n\nMy goal is to do well on the LSAT to get I to a small Law School around NYC, maybe CUNY, and then really apply myself and try to finish near the top of my class. Speaking with a professor I know who has worked at Harvard and Fordham, she recommend that approach and said even a Law School such as CUNY could help place me in a local job in NYC, even if it doesn’t have global/ national influence like a school such as Yale.\n\n\nAny thoughts on my chances of getting into Law School and/ or opinions on going down this path?",

I graduated with a 2.9 GPA, I believe the lowest in my class as the curve only goes as low as a 3.0 and anything lower than that is discretionary from the professor. My grades were poor because I missed a lot of classes due to anxiety surrounding cold calling. I also barely did any reading and only studied from commercial outlines a few days before the exam. For these reasons I did not retain any material information from any of my classes. I forgot basically everything. I feel like an imposter and don’t know how to proceed with my life. I’m currently unemployed and have been for the past 1.5 years. Should I cut my losses, give up on the law and move to a different industry? I basically have the legal knowledge of someone who read the law on Wikipedia..",

I also have a masters in computer engineering, (qualifies me to sit on the patent bar exam).\n\nAfter being in the math-y space, I have decided I do not want to continue doing research for various reasons, 1) no one will pay me to do math and statistics, 2) statistical research is toxic and full of people that behave in an extremely unprofessional manner, it isn't even funny.  \n\nBecause of these things, I began entertaining the idea of a legal career - my father was a lawyer and he planted the idea in my head since I was a kid. The plan here would be to begin in that capacity at a law firm and hope to have them fund me for a JD. But I am not sure how feasible this is. Would it be possible for me to leverage my expertise in DL/AI in a legal career? A quick search of ML/AI technical expert jobs in various law firms show very few positions open for statistics PhDs, most list computer science PhD's. How much of a stickler for degree names are these places? \n\nWould anyone be able to give advice on the feasibility of this career trajectory?",
