        "text": "First off I'd like to acknowledge why people love other arcs like wano and marineford. They are very entertaining and have great stories behind them. However for me saobaody arc is the best and most pivotal arc in one piece. I feel that it's the midway point in the strawhats story. Literally. When the arc starts you think think it's going to another typical one piece arc. The strawhats arrive at a new island, go on different small adventures to discover the history of the island, defeat the main villian and free the civilians. This time however luffy fails and he fails terribly. His actions directly lead to him losing his crewmates, he puts every other pirate on the island  in danger and for the first time he is well and truly defeated. People have noted that the lighter tone in one piece is no longer there and that's because the sabody arc is where it all changes. The strawhats realise that what piracy involves and that its a dangerous path. Thats why there's less time spent on the thousand sunny chilling and cracking jokes. Not to mention the animation is beautiful. It features important characters for the future ( kizaru, law and kidd, Raleigh)",

She's just rude and mean to everyone even though she is by far the person who depends on everyone the most. So far she's only had one fight (which I enjoyed) and that's lowest amount out of the crew. I figured that her character would be much better after cocoyashi yet here she is still calling zoro, Luffy, and usopp useless. I get that she's the navigator but I still see her more of a money obsessed thief rather than a navigator/map-maker. Even usopp who is the \"cowardly\" character has had moments where he's brave, cunning, smart, and overall just fun. He'll run away but he uses this time to breath so that he can figure out a better plan, even if that's not his intention at first. Nami...she's just a coward who's mean to her crew for no reason. I want to like her buts it's bad when I know more stuff about Nami than Nico and I still vastly prefer Nico, regardless of how little I actually know about her.",

After all, when Enel revealed his destination, I can assume almost everyone reacted like: \"That is impossible! He will die! How will he survive in the space?\" and yet he did it. Just like Luffy, who made it to Skypeia. I guess this story really is about dreams and not listening to those who laugh at you, like Blackbeard said.",

For example you type in ‘blackbeard’ it lists all the panels he appears in, and then if you write Blackbeard and Luffy, it will narrow it down to where they are together.\n\nHas any such project ever been done? I did a quick search but didn’t find anything. If anyone knows can you point me in it’s direction?\n\nGiven the longevity of the manga and the fact that there are so many interlinkages I think it would be such a powerful tool and resource for the community.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

I think Saint Saturn will be able to slow down or stop time with devil fruit abilities and that's why he will be nearly unbeatable. \n\nSaint Saturn's devil fruit could be called the Hito Hito no mi model Time God Kronos. Father Time is sometimes depicted as an elderly man in a robe holding an hourglass or time keeping device. Sometimes he is shown holding a staff or a scythe. \n\n[ Father Time](https://preview.redd.it/ag2lujshbona1.png?width=465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cdd95d2f0ff6151423b5762ccefef6bf1bac9f34)\n\n[Saturn](https://preview.redd.it/1j46jlmlgona1.png?width=97&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a1d367311a0d249bf1319c55f54ad9f1f10eab3e)\n\n[Saint Jay Garcia Saturn](https://preview.redd.it/o9tcgj0fhona1.jpg?width=374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=776518a58cfbe7e16f1d90dc66629afa7193b56c)\n\n(Is it possible Saint Saturn's staff could turn into a scythe? Yes I know my imagination is going a little wild but why not?)\n\nMaybe Saint Saturn can use his powers on targeted individuals or group and that's why we always see the Gorosei together because he can actually slow down or even stop the aging process inside his circle of influence. \n\nNow I don't just think all of this because of his name but also because of who Saturn is paired with for his mission on Egghead Island. **Kizaru, someone that is made up of light.**  Who better to accompany him if this was his power. We all know that being able to move at the speed of light can also affect time itself. Kizaru may be the only one to be able to move around or fight while Saint Saturn uses his powers. (The faster the relative velocity, the greater the time dilation between one another, with time slowing to a stop as one approaches the speed of light 299,792,458 m/s).\n\nSo, I can kind of see the next big battle being against \"time\" itself but who could actually fight such a monster duo? Possibly the monster trio but I'm not really sure. If strong haki can negate devil fruit powers then I can see Luffy, Zoro and Sanji being able to withstand the effects. \n\nLuffy would be saved by his future sight, conqueror's haki and G5 devil fruit abilities which can alter reality around himself.  Zoro could negate the effects with conquerors haki too if he reacts quickly enough once time starts to slow down. Sanji may be as fast or faster than Kizaru at this point and move at light speed. And there is always the possibility Vegapunk has a secret counter weapon for an occasion like this. Who knows. ***Just think of it being a superior version of (THE GOAT) Foxy's slow slow beam.***\n\nI'm not saying that Saturn is physically super strong but if he has these powers then he doesn't have to be and Kizaru is there to do most of the fighting anyway. I just think that Saint Saturn's powers should reflect on his position and rank among the World Government and Celestial Dragon hierarchy. I mean he is one of the leaders of the non-FREE world after all....\n\nI do think his main task is to take control and custody of all the Seraphim and Pacifistas with as little resistance as possible. And that would have been the case when they first left on their mission but now it looks like this \"monster duo\" will have to flex a bit to accomplish their goals with a Yonko Crew on the scene. \n\n**Hito hito no mi model Time God Kronos** and Kizaru **vs**  \n**Hito hito no mi model Sun God Nika,** Sanji and Zoro",

I also see the cross guild also choosing to side with luffy.\n\nDuring the war or just before, when all the strawhat allies are together, mihawk will see fuji and see that he carries a blade and therefore is a swordsman. I then think mihawk will immediately, regardless of what’s happening, challenge fuji on the spot. Mihawk will defeat and maybe even kill fuji in this fight and this would represent mihawks unhealthy obsession of being the best swordsman and how this obsession with this dream has clouded his mind of what he truly should be fighting for, which is fighting the true evil, the world gov/navy.\n\nThis would set up mihawk vs zoro nicely as zoro has somewhat respect for fuji after dressrosa. Zoro will confront mihawk about this after the war which will lead into their fight. Zoro also strives to be the best swordsman but he didn’t let it stop him from doing good and fighting for freedom with luffy unlike mihawk who focused purely on this ambition of swordsmanship. \n\nI think this would add another layer to zoro vs mihawk.\nThanks for reading.",

The deal is that WG won't **actively** pursue the remnants of the Roger Pirates but can keep their bounties active (so that it won't be too obvious that Roger strike a deal with the WG). They (WG) **can actively** pursue the remnants of the Roger Pirates if the remnants are still active as a Pirate (such as joining another crew, making a new crew etc).   \nThis deal was reinforced as Roger promised to the WG that the remnants of the Roger Pirates won't disclose anything that they found when they visited Laughtale (this is what Roger asked for the rest of the crew mates when he disbanded the crew). That's why when Roger opened the Great Pirate Era, WG still abides to the deal. WG is still afraid that the Remnants of the Roger Pirates will disclose anything that they found on that island(Laughtale).  \nWhy would Roger made this deal? He made a promise with the rest of his crewmates that there would be time that they will serve their purpose, but for now, it is their duty to lay low and stay alive until the promised time, the Great War, to which the new Pirate King will need the strength of everyone in the Roger Pirates. They might also be guarding the Weapons or The Red Poneglyph until there would be someone that comes to claim them.   \nAlso a fact, Rayleigh, Crocus and Oden guards an important landmark of the Grand Line (Crocus = The Entrance of the Grand Line (the place where it all begins), Rayleigh = The Entrance of the Fishman Island (the place where one of the Weapon is located, Poseidon) and Oden = The only Island where Poneglyph was created and where one of the Weapon lays dormant, Pluton)\n\nThis conditions however is only known by the Higher Ups of WG and Marines such as **the Gorosei and the Fleet Admirals/Admirals or Garp** as to avoid leakage and blemish to the integrity of the World Government.\n\nThat's why when Rayleigh was spotted on Sabaody Archipelago, no Admirals was sent to capture Rayleigh (like a Buster Call) since Rayleigh is literally one of the people that knows the Exact Detail of the Void Century and might even know the true location to One Piece since he's Roger's First mate.  \n   \nIt is also weird that Crocus literally sits at the entrance of the Grand Line without any care of getting captured (but this might've been because Marines doesn't go through the entrance and Crocus stayed inside of Laboon which is not visible to others).",

In my mind he would follow the Straw Hats from arc to arc, like Team Rocket from Pokemon, always trying to capture Luffy. Years later, when I decided to actually get into One Piece, I remember being completely shocked when I learned that Sanji was not only a good guy but a member of the Straw Hat pirates.\n* I also remember believing that Devil Fruit powers were exceptionally rare, to the point that Luffy was one of like 10 people in the entire world to have them.",

        "text": "My theory is that Nami is a descendant of  an ancient and powerful kingdom responsible for the creation of Uranus or at least connected to it. I believe residents of this kingdom  were unique and had the ability to sense the weather around them. I believe this because Nami's weather sensing abilities and knowledge have always been Highlighted as special and unique with many people praising her and acknowledging her skills. Enel did ,Vivi did, Arlong did and many more others across the show. Oda even personally made a movie about Nami being Kidnapped due to her amazing navigation and weather sensing abilities. I don't think Oda would highlight this for no reason and its good to note that this gift is exclusive to her and no one has ever shown such abilities in the series.\n\nI believe this clan were the users and protectors and possible creators of the ancient weapon Uranus.  Though they were all protectors of Uranus, there was only one chosen person meant to wield the weapon and bring out its full might and she was known as Aphrodite.  Aphrodite was the princess born from the royal family  known for her extreme beauty and her special connection with Uranus and her otherworldly weather sensing abilities. The abilities of Aphrodite where passed down through generation to generation of the royal family manifesting in the princesses. I believe Nami is the latest princess in the bloodline or a descendant of her.  Before I continue with my theory let see the similarities between Nami and the actual goddess Aphrodite.\n\nNami is based on the goddess Aphrodite and there are many similarities between the two. The first similarity and most obvious one is their appearances, Aphrodite is seen to be depicted with with orange hair in many paintings and writings and is said to be to be amazingly beautiful as she is the god of beauty and love.  What I described is basically Nami and the craziest thing is that Oda isn't trying to hide this similarity, many people along the show have called Nami an actual goddess due to her beauty and her beauty is constantly highlighted through out the show e.g happiness punch etc.  To be honest there are many more similarities  and I cant explain them as well, so I'm gonna put a link here to someone who made a great post about their similarities (shout out to  u/mimike500)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/l2v0d5/nami\\_as\\_goddess\\_aphrodite\\_or\\_venus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/l2v0d5/nami_as_goddess_aphrodite_or_venus/)\n\nAphrodite is the daughter of Uranus In mythology and I definitely believe Oda based Nami on Aphrodite for this reason. \n\nWe already know nami shares an inexplainable bond with shirahoshi (posiden) because In the fishman arc shirahoshi says she's feels comfortable around nami and that she feels  some sort of connection between them. I think this is because like posiden  Uranus power is  passed through the bloodline (reincarnation) so what shirahoshi felt was the bond shared between the former weapon holders in the past (their ancestors) . \n\nThese are all the links I can think about between Nami and Uranus as much isn't known about Uranus, but I will make another post about how Imu might be Namis mother as well as what may have happened in the okyot nation. Hope you guys enjoyed my theory. Also sorry about the grammar mistakes in the post lol.",

And how he wanted to be a pirate? Shanks would always tell him now, because he is not strong enough, too young and how the world is too dangerous etc.\nAfter Luffy got himself in trouble with the mountain bandits and Shanks had to safe him from the Sea King, Shanks gave Luffy his Straw Hat, telling him to return it to him after he has become a strong pirate and thats when they'll see eachother again.\n\nWhat if Luffy's Dream is just simply to return the Straw Hat to Shanks? Proving to him that he is a strong pirate?\n\nIn his childish mindset it makes sense he'd want to become the Pirate King for that, since that is supposed to be the \"strongest pirate\". On top of that, they are called the Straw Hat Pirates, so Luffy giving that back to him any time earlier than that, would mean the crew would lose their \"identity\" seeing as the Straw Hat is their biggest recognizable feature.\n\nIt would also explain why Luffy would call it his treasure and loses his mind over losing it ALWAYS, because losing it would mean he cant fullfill his dream any longer. \n\nIt would fit his character and fits the story. I don't have any evidence for this, obviously, just thought it was very interesting to me.",
