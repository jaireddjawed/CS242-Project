        "text": "So in my opinion most of the engineering is geared towards product and implementing business logic correctly\n\nThere is no tech development that i have got to work on , so by tech i mean things like work on a engineering problem solving latency , improving app rendering \nTime \n\nHowever i did work on was edging the architecture towards business, modularising it such that it helps us reduce development and integration time, worked on writing clean code and maintainable code. But if you look at all of this we are always focusing on product, most work here is in just replicating the idea of the product overcome challenges and make things compatible \n\nMy engineering side is always confused as there is  no creativity that you can show while getting hands dirty on product, not that you can’t but won’t be able to, its just that they are so passionate about product that there is no space for tech, all tech does is in alignment and realignment of code to product \n\nWhat should i be doing to keep me motivated! What do you think is wrong with my though process or my area of focus? It is that the difference between the product and engineering is not a-lot , i need to learn product development and just start having fun!! \n\nNote: Product companies are the only ones that pay so well , at-least the ones that hire me",

It is approach to engineering management/measurement advice.**\n\nWith over 10 years of experience, every time when I was assigned to a project I was with a mindset of delivering good job (never ideal, I did my mistakes, I procrastinated a lot, I had my good and bad days). I tried to deliver well engineered software, and clearly communicating pros, cons, strong and weak parts of particular approach.\n\nI was never fired, never got bad performance review, rarely any negative feedback. Other egineers often asks me for feedback, help, and mentorship. People who I interview (even those rejected) often tells me that it was one of best interview they ever had. I consider myself solid guy (not a rockstar though).\n\nHowever, I **never cared about metrics**.\n\nWhat I mean:\n\n- when I write tests, I don't care if there's 70% coverage or 99%. I just test what should be tested.\n\n- when API response must be below 250ms I just focus on good code and design, and when it is 75ms it is because I was doing my job, and not because I was focusing on given metric.\n\n- when I mentor younger colleagues, I don't measure their productivity increase due to my mentorship. I just try to make them better.\n\nYou know - I just **do the job**.\n\nNow however, my bosses are doing some change now, and all initiatives has to be precisely justified with a metric/outcome. \n\nUnfortunately, I am unable to work on a problem/task having in mind \"this metric has to go up/down\" instead of having in mind \"let's just make it better\".\n\nIs there something wrong with my mindset?

        "text": "I'm  a front end software engineer and have been one for the past 10 years. I  have tried a few times in the past, but I'm fully dedicated to learning  algorithms. I'm enrolled in a program to learn and it's going well. I'm  2 weeks in and I'd hoped to be better at problem solving at this point.  I can understand the concepts, but something isn't fully clicking and  it's frustrating. My main issue seems to be taking a similar problem and  adjusting the solution to fit the new problems need. In addition,  sometimes translating my idea to code and not covering all use cases.\n\nI  grew up with a learning disability and realize that this is a slight  setback, since I tend to learn a bit slower and differently than others.  I fear that I may not ever understand the concepts, but know I'm being a  bit over dramatic. I'm reaching out to the community to get any advice  or tips to:\n\n* Feel more confident in my learning\n* Measure how well I'm doing\n* Any other advice\n\nOne  of the instructors said that it's about recognizing patterns and  adjusting for each problem. This resonated with me, while I'm able to  recognize patterns, I'm struggling.\n\nMy current program is set up to go through a different topic each week. The setup each week is:\n\n1. Prep work: I have around 6-10 hours of videos and 7-8 problems\n2. Class: Go over all prep work\n3. Homework: approx 10 problems to solve\n4. Class: Go over homework\n\nDue  to the amount of work and free time I have, I limit myself 40 minutes  to solve each problem. In that 40 minutes, I'm not allowed to look up  the problem or look at the solution. I find I'm able to solve around  20-30% of the problems in the time limit. Any advice or feedback would  be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "The key principles of software engineering are a set of fundamental guidelines that guide the development, maintenance, and evolution of high-quality software products. Here are some of the essential principles of software engineering:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Modularity: This principle involves breaking down the software system into small, self-contained, and reusable modules or components. By doing so, the system becomes easier to understand, maintain, and evolve.\n2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a software component, while exposing only the relevant functionalities to the users. This principle improves the clarity and simplicity of the software design.\n3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods into a single unit, or object, and restricting direct access to the object's internal state. This principle ensures that the software components are self-contained, reusable, and easily maintainable.\n4. Separation of Concerns: This principle involves separating the different aspects of software design, such as functionality, data storage, and user interface, into distinct modules or components. This principle makes the software more modular, scalable, and maintainable.\n5. Maintainability: Maintainability is the ease with which a software system can be modified, adapted, or extended. This principle emphasizes the importance of writing clean, well-organized, and documented code to facilitate the maintenance and evolution of the software.\n6. Reusability: Reusability involves designing software components that can be reused in multiple contexts or applications. This principle reduces development time and costs, improves the quality and consistency of the software, and enhances productivity.\n7. Testing: Testing is the process of evaluating software quality and functionality by running automated or manual tests. This principle ensures that the software meets the requirements, is reliable, and performs as expected.\n\nThese principles provide a solid foundation for software engineering practices and help to ensure that software products are of high quality, maintainable, and scalable. By following these principles, software engineers can develop software systems that meet the needs of the users, are easy to maintain, and can evolve over time.",

        "text": "Software Engineering is defined by the IEEE. It also has its body of knowledge standardized, again by the IEEE, and  the standard teaches what a software engineer should know when he has 4 years of experience.\n\nOver the last few years, I have been looking up to the guide to the software engineering body of knowledge (SWEBOK). [swebokwiki.org/](https://swebokwiki.org/) More formally, it is available as a PDF (free!) at [https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering](https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering) \n\nSoftware engineering is not programming. Programming is only the construction stage of software engineering. There are also requirements engineering, software design, engineering management, etc. Software engineering is not computer science. Computer science is only the foundation for software engineering. Software engineering is what the IEEE definition says it is. It is not something that a person deduces individually by trial and error to fit the definition. It is instead The body of knowledge standardized by the SWEBOK (link above) plus the books/papers in references.\n\nI understand that most people are competent in the construction stage and unaware of the theory, practice, tools, non-engineering approaches and engineering approaches to do something else than software construction. Few are aware of engineering management to initiate their project themselves, even fewer are aware of requirements engineering to elicit, analyze, specify, validate requirements and that includes creating multiple conceptual models, and so on. This requires people to use practical modeling tools and more. Once a person becomes really good at software development with the full SDLC, then that is when they are ready to transform from development approaches to engineering approaches, by adding project management, engineering process, engineering models and methods, and so on.\n\nYou need to know it is standardized at [https://www.computer.org/product/education/software-engineering-models-course](https://www.computer.org/product/education/software-engineering-models-course) (every SW eng. with 4 years of experience should not this). On the other hand, a programmer who is concerned only about software construction does not know this, not even when the programmer has 20 years of experience, unless first using a full SDLC for a few years and then transforming from development approaches to engineering approaches. \n\nSo, learning goes like this:\n\n1. programming using math/computer science\n2. software development using a full SDLC (requirements engineering, software design, software construction, software testing)\n3. software engineering using engineering management, engineering process, engineering models and methods, engineering economics, and so on.\n\nOver the last few years, I have seen only one person on reddit who appears to know and do software engineering. The person is Thomas Owens. Additionally, I also count myself as understanding and doing it, although I am not yet done mastering the body of knowledge.\n\nDo you know anyone else who understands SW engineering is what the SWEBOK recommends, and what the IEEE definition says, or do you or all your colleagues/contacts misleadingly speak about computer science without actually being aware of, and without applying engineering approaches from the SWEBOK?",

Develop a script that does a \"raw\" extraction of all the data available in the databases and stores it in some \"intermediate\" database.\n2. Develop a script that runs inside the \"intermediate\" database and checks for some inconsistencies according to pre-defined rules (eg. automatically detects trends or inconsistent patterns accross different variables etc.) then sends \"alerts\" where these inconsitencies arise. As I deal with a lot of qualitative data, I need this \"intermediate\" database to be user-accessible in the sense that the user can enter the database and include an input where the correction of qualitative data is needed.\n3. Once the check/cleansing is complete, the \"verified\" data gets pushed to a data warehouse. From there, it will be used for reports.\n\nI have no clue where to start and if there are any solutions that have been developed to address such issues. I don't know what database I can use for the intermediate step (cloud is not allowed, which is a shame), and I don't know how to write a python script that does the check and creates alerts for the user.\n\nAny help would be highly appreciated.

I'm looking for more of a straight forward \"how-to\" to go back to the basics and confirm I'm doing them adequately. Feel like I'm stumbling a bit lately and not sure if its my performance or just the situation in my current company.  Has anyone any opinions on \"The Art of Scalability\"?",

My laptop has gotten rather slow for everything I’m doing on it and I want to make the investment now for a laptop that would last me 7-10 years as I enter the development world. Can anyone point me in the right direction of what I should get terms of GPU , CPU , RAM , …..etc. Budget is $1600 but I’d be willing to put in more maybe if it means having a laptop that will last me long and function properly.",
