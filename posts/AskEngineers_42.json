A HUGE notch in a beam:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GOsrc0k.jpg\n\nThis is one of the 2 main beams of the house. Is there an easy way to fix that? I wanted to call an actual engineer to come and see, but they are basically NONE where I live. The only one I was able to find cannot look at it before next year.\n\nIt's a one floor house with the basement. Not a lot of weight over that beam. No idea I was thinking about putting a post under it, a real one, not a temporary one. No idea what to do here and I'm a bit lost.",

I do wonder if this is the right way to do it, according to ISO 129 that is.  \n\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/cz5Ttpo](https://imgur.com/a/cz5Ttpo)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like this is the correct way of dimensioning this but I can't proof it. When you also add dimension from the sides to one hole, you'll have to be aware of tolerance stacking. Which will sometimes force you to add tighter tolerances to achieve something simple. Or would the only correct way to doing it like this be with a symmetry tolerance on the 50 and a datum on 100? I work with ISO 129 and ISO 1101 for GD&amp;T, ISO 2768-mK for general tolerances. Does anyone know this?",

Taking that into account, I have been thrust into the world of drafting and design through my work.\n\nI've been working for a company which builds and ships laboratory equipment all across the world for 6 years. We've had a lot of issues with various machinists and machine shops which make our parts.\n\nRight now, I'm trying to learn about GD&amp;T flatness.\n\nI've read several articles on the subject, and I think I have a basic understanding, but since I have not used this callout before, I'm a bit anxious to add it to our drawings if my understanding is not correct.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nI have a thickness callout for a 4\" HRS disc which is .205\" +/- .005\", which gives me .010\" of potential variance (.210 - .200).\n\nCan I put a flatness callout of .005\" on the top  surface, or will that be redundant/over constrained?\n\nI think it works, but my understanding is limited and I have had zero training in any of this except for what I've been able to read and figure out myself by pestering our various machinists, but like many subjects, we often require a certain amount of knowledge on the subject before we're even capable of having a conversation about the same subject, or to know to ask the right questions, so it can be difficult for me to overcome the jargon simply to communicate my needs.\n\nThank you",

I want to leave myself the option of going into aerospace, but have a broader degree as well. My school offers the following:\n\nMajor in Mathematics—Applied Science\n\nThis major is designed for students with a substantial interest in mathematics and its applications to a particular field such as physics, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, cognitive science, computer science, economics, management science, or engineering.\n\nThe premise is that you take a majority math major, but half of your upper division courses are dedicated to a science of your choice. I would be able to take meche/aero/physics courses to fulfill those requirements, such as:\n\n  Introduction to Mathematical Physics  \n\n  Computational Methods in Engineering  \n\n  Probability and Statistical Methods for Mechanical Engineering \n\n  Computational Physics I: Probabilistic Models and Simulations \n\n Computational Physics II: PDE and Matrix Models \n\n  Elementary Plasma Physics \n\n Space Mission Analysis and Design \n\nMy question is, how would aerospace engineering companies view this major as opposed to my current aerospace engineering major? I would be able to market myself as having programming skills and a strong math and physics background, but I would lack the well rounded aerospace curriculum. By switching my major, am I astronomically harming my chances of getting an aerospace engineering job?\n\nThank you\n\nTL;DR\n\nHow would aerospace companies view a math and applied science degree with strong engineering and physics coursework compared to a pure aerospace engineering degree?",

Sadly,  just some days ago I had to say a worker that I \"didn't need his  permission\" to do some tests on a process. I informed him about that, and his  answer (\"no, will not do that\") actually pissed me off. This type of  answer was not usual for me, and if relented I'd never could do those  tests, but now I'm even thinking that not only conveyed the wrong idea  (the whole thing has upscaled and now I said things like \"I didn't ask  your opinion\", \"this is mine and I can do whatever\" and so on... in the  version of the workers) but that the same workers could simply screw the process and blame me and my tests for that.\n\nI'm  the only engineer there, was always cordial to them and maybe even  soft, now that I need to be firm, they are not taking it well. Again, I'm learning about those kind of things, but would like to know, based  on your experience, if some advice or general rule of thumb could be  used when dealing with this type of situations.\n\nSorry for the mistakes, english is not my first languaje.",

I have both my Bachelors (2020) and Masters (2021) in biomedical engineering.  I’ve had a few positions in medical device R&amp;D (internship at small company, directed research in a neuro lab, student temp during masters), but after graduation I found it near impossible to find a position in medical product development. \n\nMy first position out of college was developing prototype bioreactor bags. It was an interesting position, but wanted to get my foot in the door at a medical device company. 7 months later I accepted a position as a risk management engineering working with hospital patient monitors. Unfortunately, our company recently announced some significant layoffs, so I started the job hunt once again. Just this week I was extended a job offer as a Quality Engineer II at Medtronic working at a new manufacturing site. It’s a great company, good pay, and I would likely have more diverse responsibilities than my current position. \n\nMy worry is that in taking this QE position, I’ll be narrowing myself further down the quality career route. Like most engineers, my goal is to work in product development, but with my current experience, I have had close to 0 opportunities for even a recruiter interview with small companies. Does anyone here have experience moving from quality to R&amp;D/product development? Is it worth getting experience in quality before moving into more technical roles? Or is quality truly a dead end?

In my line of work, I work on Airsoft guns (similar to paintball if you don't know what it is) that require a torsion spring to hold a latch that prevents gears from spinning in reverse. Some company decided to replace this torsion spring with a compression spring and claims that it will last longer and locks the gear into place faster. I would like to know if this is true or not as I'm no expert. I attached a crudely drawn image of what I'm talking about, the red circle is the latch, followed by a diagram with a blue depiction of the spring. I googled this and all I found was garage springs.
