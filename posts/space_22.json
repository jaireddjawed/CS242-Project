        "text": "If you run a business in Quebec with more than 25 employees, you are required to invest 1% of your payroll into employee training under the Working Skills Act, also known as the “1% Training Law”. This law was created in 1996 to help employers supply their staff with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed.\n\nOne example of a training option employers can invest in is mindfulness training. Mindfulness training provides many benefits for employers and employees. It can help reduce absenteeism and turnover, capitalize on team morale, and promote employee engagement and productivity. For individuals, it can promote better mental health, reduce stress, increase job satisfaction, and improve focus and concentration.\n\nThe 1% Training Law sets out the rules and regulations for developing, recognizing, and certifying work skills, administered by the Ministère de l’Emploi et de la Solidarité sociale. It is important to note for companies who fail to meet this 1% training investment, the difference will be remitted as a contribution to the Quebec government’s workplace training fund.\n\nTo keep up with the changing needs of today’s labour market, employers and employees should take advantage of government-funded programs, industry-specific programs, and private workplace training, such as workplace mindfulness training to improve their skills and knowledge, as well as their physical and emotional well-being.\n\nFor more information on how workplace mindfulness training can bolster your organization, [contact Mindfulness Space](https://mindfulnessspace.ca/).",
