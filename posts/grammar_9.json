Where \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\[buy\\] it? \\[no more context around here\\]\n\n... only 'Where DID YOU BUY it' is correct, but \"where HAVE YOU BOUGHT it\" isn't.\n\nI usually explain to my students that it's because we are asking a special question with an intent to specify something about an event in the past, especially when it follows as a reaction to inital excitement from the news we hear, which is normally formulated in Present Perfect.\n\nHowever, the Oxford dictonary and other credible sources give following examples that overturn everything I used to think was true:\n\n* *‘Have* *you* *heard* *the news about Mike?’* *‘No.* ***What has*** *he* ***done****?’* *‘He's won* *the competition.* \n\nIn this sentence, a question word is used but still no Past Simple. I know you will say that \"there is no such a rule that you can't make a Present Perfect question with a question word\", but then, how would you explain why Past Simple was the only correct option in the first sentence above? Especially if seen in contrast to the second sentence from the dictionary.",
