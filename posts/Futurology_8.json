What will this do to people, to culture? Many articles talk about this issue, but most seem to talk around it and keep their view to a societal level. I want to know what the average r/futuralogy poster, commenter, and lurker thinks about it. What do you think life will be like for the average person in 50 years?",

There is no physical benefit to using your body as an incubator when you can use a specialized structure that is arguably more reliable. Any sort of \"mating behavior\" would become vestigial instincts from the evolutionary past. Perhaps it might even be seen as something to be removed along with a  bunch of other now useless \"crocodile instincts\" still present in the human psyche.\n\nAnother interesting question is how families might work in such a world. Evolution will favor societies that are able to effectively raise large amounts of mentally healthy and productive children using artificial wombs. I imagine the meta-psychology and behaviors of such cultures would be completely alien to anything we are used to now.",

        "text": "Large-scale Post-scarcity societies and individualism are a contradiction. The only way for an advanced AI system to accurately meet the needs of billions of people and manage such a society is through constant surveillance. If you want to get the most out of your AI-advisor, then you need to let it watch everything you do. Now its very likely people will have the option of refusing this surveillance, but if they do they will be shunned as these individuals will be a threat to other people's state of post-scarcity.\n\nHere is a simple example. Imagine someone who wants to find a long-term relationship. Statistically, there is a correlation between having a large number of sexual partners and relationship instability. Therefore it makes logical sense that people that want certainty in finding a stable relation will let their AI matchmaker watch them to *prove* they have a low count of sexual partners (as well as other characteristics) and will automatically mistrust any individual who turns off his or her surveillance. This principle applies to everything. People who refuse to accept surveillance or follow the norms that maximize the *communal* state of post-scarcity will simply be shunned by those who do. An even more extreme and darker extension of this principle is a scenario in which people are ostracized and shamed for not using specific brain/ personality modifications.\n\nThere is simply no way of getting around this. I think post-scarcity societies will have a strange culture that has more in common with the shame-motivated communitarian societies of antiquity rather than the rugged individualism of modernity. Now there may be outlets for people who find large and conformist societies unpalatable. Space colonization is an example of this. However similar rules may apply. If someone wants to qualify for a colony mission they will have to follow rules and meet certain requirements. You might even see a \"solipsist movement,\" in which people retreat into single-person habitats in which all social interaction is recreated via AI or similar virtual worlds.",

There are all kinds of other interesting attempts. There's a network state for the African diaspora (Afropolitan) and one for van lifers (Kift life). The list goes on and on, I've written about them a few times/interviewed some leaders on my podcast.\n\nGenerally, they have a very solarpunk ethos, attract techie folks, and tend to be male-dominated (we're trying to fix that, obviously).
