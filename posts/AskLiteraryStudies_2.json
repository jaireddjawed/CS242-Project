I loved James Joyce in college, and the secondary readings really helped me to both understand the complexities of the major novels and to enjoy the ride.\n\nTo put it another way:\n\n* If I took an undergraduate course on Nabokov, whose work would I be reading along with the novels themselves? \n* Is there an \"Introduction to Nabokov\"? \n* Are there \"guides\" to the major works, not unlike the *Annotated Lolita*, but with more than just a list of references?\n* Is there something more advanced than a Cliff's Notes, but more approachable than an 800-page monograph?\n\nHuge thanks in advance!",

From a deafening roar, it became softer, quieter. The thundering sheet of water thinned, became a trickle ...\" \n\nI'm considering that ellipsis as becoming a symbolic expression of the decreasing water flow, repesentative of becoming a trickle. \n\nIs there a term for this type of literary expression? \n\nThank you for your input!",

I am starting to prepare for my Master's Degree program, and I am in the phase of nailing down the exact subject of my research. I am a huge horror fan, and Horror Lit. has always been my intention when researching literature, specifically the works of H. P. Lovecraft.\n\nSo, what I want to ask here is if you think the idea I am going to describe below is grounded enough for me to build up upon (and if you have any suggestions of bibliography), or if maybe I am reaching for something that is too far fatched.\n\nI would like to build my Master's dissertation and research project creating a theorical and analysis bridge between the horror fiction of H. P. Lovecraft, whose works describe the existential dread experienced by humans in contact with creatures that can't be grasped by the character's limited minds, and Sartre's existentialist phylosophy. In this case, I would use Sartre's book \"Being and Nothingnes\" as a toolbox to build up a fresher outlook on horror lit.\n\nI would really appreciate any input. Thanks a bunch!",

Been on writer's block for at least 2, maybe 3 years. A lot of typing in a word and then backspacing, rinse and repeat.\n\nI'm sure a degree in English Lit would definitely help and improve my writing, and not just by a small amount. I'm also fascinated in dissecting English Lit, I've heard it's called critical theory in literary academic circles? Unfortunately I won't have time to do another degree for a long time, maybe even a decade. I don't want to wait that long and fully intend to educate myself on English Lit. What can you recommend to me? Are there any free online resources I can access immediately which can provide a degree level education, and if not what are my options other than a 4 year dedicated degree program?\n\nApart from that, I've mostly observed critical work on classics, which makes sense - but I'm sure there must be some critical work on more recent works and novels, maybe post-2000? Any critical work on genre fiction, for example? Where would I find these if they're available?\n\nThank you for your time, have a nice day :)",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI hope this is the right place to post this. It’s not a homework question.\n\nIs the ending of The Glass Menagerie (Tennessee Williams) tragic for Laura? The tragedy of Tom is plain to see; he is out living his dream but cannot enjoy a second of it because of his overwhelming guilt. Amanda is abandoned by her son years after her husband leaves her, so she's clearly tragic too.\n\nBut what about Laura? My professor points to (1) the unicorn figurine breaking and (2) Laura blowing out the candles at the end as obvious signs that there was little hope for Laura after her disappointing \"date\" with Jim and after Tom's later departure. This confused me because I read the character a little differently (I read the play before the lecture).\n\nThe unicorn is a symbol of Laura's fragility and uniqueness, both of which are fairly positive, even endearing qualities but which also make her tragic during the play. The unicorn must break for Laura to come out of her shell. She must give up the things she seeks security in - as delicate, lovely and romantic as they may be - to survive in the world. As she says to Jim, it really is a \"blessing in disguise\".\n\nAnd when I read the line \"Blow out your candles, Laura\" (following which Laura actually blows out the candles onstage), I saw that as Tom's wish to no longer be haunted by thoughts of his sister as well as a symbol of Laura leaving her unusual fantasy world of security. She must abandon her candles to become an adult, to become part of the world that is \"lit by lightning\". There is a definite, poignant loss of innocence here, but I also had the sense, especially after Jim's good-natured words of encouragement to her, that Laura might end up just fine. She was miserable being her pure, innocent \"candle\" self because it cut her off from the world and from the prospect of a full life. Having to leave behind this older self is very sad indeed, but necessary for her growth in the long run. This is how I read it, but judging from other people's commentary, Laura's future is generally seen as being much more bleak.\n\nAm I missing some important textual clues? I feel like I might also be imposing my own personal views and not seeing the play as it really is. For example, maybe I cannot see why Laura is necessarily doomed because I, like any other 21st-century reader, am too far removed from the world of the play?",

I now want to return to my original idea, because I think what made it interesting was that it had been an underexplored topic. Does anybody have advice for researching something underrepresented/new? If you've researched something relatively underexplored before, how did you go about it?\n\nThanks in advance!

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm taking a gap year to work and do some CV building after completing an MA in English Lit this year.   I arrived at grad school through a fairly unconventional path.  Long story short, I was a pretty apathetic/mediocre student during undergrad -- was lucky enough to get a pretty strong foothold in a journalism career apart from school, spent most of my first three years on freelancing/internships and didn't put too much effort into my coursework...and then fell head over heels in love with it in my last two years.  Spent 6 years covering the White House/Congress in DC + pining for my lit. seminars, got fed up with it, and decided to go back to school.\n\nMy in-major GPA was very strong, but my overall was pretty weak...+ since I'd been away for a while I  had a hard time running down letters of recommendation.  But!  I did manage to get full funding + a GTA/part-time instructor position from my alma mater.\n\nThe MA went great -- my thesis passed with distinction, I finished with a 4.0, and I have a group of professors who I feel confident turning to for letters of recommendation.\n\nHowever!  Despite feeling great about my statement of intent/writing sample/good GRE score, I was really under-confident about my MA app. materials because of my time away and the weak GPA issue so I only put in one application.  I don't have a bad thing to say about the department at all and personally think it's pretty criminally underrated...but as far as recognition goes, it's far from an academic powerhouse.\n\nSo.  At present, I'm working with a mediocre undergrad performance, followed by a really strong showing in grad school, albeit in a lesser known program.  I've got more than my fair share of work that I'm proud of from seminars as well as parts of my thesis that I'm confident about using as writing samples, I feel pretty good about writing a statement of intent, and I have a strong pool of professors for letters of recommendation. \n\nI've also spent the past few months hammering out conference abstracts for forthcoming research and I'm cleaning up + revising the handful of seminar papers and a chapter from my thesis that my professors recommended considering for publication.  I'm not expecting a super high hit rate on all of this stuff since I'm still fairly green, but I do think I'll come out of this round of submissions with at least one or two new lines for my CV by the time I start putting in applications.\n\nAnyway!  I've also been trying really hard to gauge my prospects for how competitive my application will be at some of the better ranked programs that I'm considering.  I've done a decent amount of digging through lists of current students' published work and I feel like most of it is stuff I can hang with (at least what I can find from first/second year students).   \n\nWondering if any of you guys have any guidance for what a competitive application looks like coming from a smaller/lesser known/lower ranked university or advice for what I can do to put myself on similar footing with students coming out of more recognizable schools?  Are there any goals that I should be setting for myself where conference talks and publication are concerned?  Or any other steps that I can take during my gap year to make myself more appealing to an admissions committee?",

Mostly it seems to revel in the politics to me, and I feel like there's no meaningful subversion of orientalist tropes. It just kinda uses them sometimes.\n\nThe trouble is I find most of the criticism Muse, Jstor and Google Scholar are throwing to me when I do a search just explains where some of the formal components are taking inspiration from.

The first was to acquaint students with beauty, especially as manifest in ‘poetry’ broadly conceived…A second element thus entered the humanities: a stress on continuities linking the ‘poetry’ of one era to that of succeeding periods and ultimately our own. Hence, there developed a sharper sense of imparting the moral essence of European civilization to students in higher education through the study of great literature and the conviction that literary criticism was the disciplined means to that end. This is one aspect of criticism that has religious roots without being religious, with its emphasis not on doubt but on a particular kind of cultivation of the self” (53-54). \n\nI’m not a cultural nor a literary scholar. I’m just a student, so I don’t feel that I’m fully capturing the implications, nuances, and complexities that Asad is writing about. What role does “beauty” and “cultivation of the self” have here? Or if it’s too much too explain, does anybody have any reading recommendations that touches on what Asad is getting at here? \n\nThanks in advance.",

The text has long since become public domain, obviously.\n\nHowever, does a new, separate copyright apply to the text, if you transcribe it to a modern orthography and publish it that way - *A Midsummer Night's Dream*? To me, a layman, it seems like it wouldn't, since it's a very surface-level, technical intervention.\n\nBut critical editions are in most cases not simple transcriptions of the older texts, but active attempts to clear up the text and make it as definitive as possible. So, a critical edition of *MND* will probably refer to different early editions (the first and second quatro, the first folio), choosing by this or that metric which word and verse is most appropriate for the final critical text, or even \"inventing\" new parts of the text\\*, based on these or those editorial principles. (*I'm specifically thinking of Sonnet #25, where the original edition rhymes worth-quite in lines 9 and 11, so the editors conclude it is a mistake altogether, and come up with a new word to correct it: fight-quite, might-quite, or worth-forth.) This results in more or less different texts by different editors, reflecting different data and different goals - almost a form of secondary authorship, like translation. But, how is it all viewed from the legal perspective? And how much does the copyright law differ across countries in this regard?",

I used to attend Oregon State University for Physics, but became overwhelmed by the campus and courses and subsequentially decided Physics was not my Forte. I've been writing as a hobby since I was a child, predominantly writing fantasy or fiction novels but also occasionally poetry. I was reluctant to pursue writing before since I had so little self confidence, but I'm confident I can learn and develop my skills into something extraordinary. The problem, I guess, is I'm worried about my future work in regards to cultural diversity... I live in a little town that would qualify as MAGA country, so there's very little diversity and cultural education, and i feel like the public school system had some inherently racist ideals. Does anybody know of a nice online course option that will include education regarding culture, ethnicity, race, and real history that hasn't been sprinkled with white washed sugar?",

I contacted a few schools and talked to some people I know and everyone said it might be hard to get into a gender studies program since I only had one course at university that focused on gender specifically. I was hoping to get some advice from anyone who made the switch from English to gender studies. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to strengthen my application?",

        "text": " Hello, I have many friends / family who enjoy watching the news yet seem to be completely unaffected by it. Despite the news reporting crisis after crisis, problem after problem, my friends and family remain political centrists who continue to support liberal capitalism and the status quo.\n\nIt is as if watching the news is like watching a movie for them. It seems to be mere entertainment without any impact on how they should organize and conduct their lives. How and why is this? How can people be exposed to all of these crises, then just disavow it all to continue on with business as usual?\n\nIs it that the spectators perceive the displayed events as external and distant to themselves? That the events are taking place within 'the world', but not within 'their world'? That their conceptual maps are compartmentalized which enables them to keep all these things separate?\n\nOr does the structure of media itself induce passivity, alienation, and disempowerment? The media never addresses the root of the problem, but merely presents surface level images. That is, none of the events are presented as being the result of processes within a coherent whole, but are presented as isolated occurrences. Moreover, the media commentators themselves present everything with a detached, indifferent demeanor. This seems to induce passivity and alienation within the spectators, who in themselves are passive recipients.\n\nMy question is: what mechanics are at play for spectators to remain so passive and indifferent despite the media presenting them with crisis after crisis? For example, how can we watch repeated environmental catastrophes then continue to vote for politicians and political parties who do nothing? Thanks",
