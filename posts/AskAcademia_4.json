        "text": "Hello,\nI have a question about getting authorship as a junior researcher.\n\nSo, where I work, the convention is that authorship goes to the director (it’s an academic research center), and that all other team members get acknowledged, not by name but as the center’s team. This also applies to projects where the team does all the work (desk research, fieldwork, writing,  editing and everything else included) and the director just reviews it. \n\nWe just wrapped up a project that’s part of a larger network where, as part of the project, all contributors get co-authorship. We got into a discussion over the order of authors, and when we suggested that we have a note stating that we all contributed equally, we were told that such note is not professional, and that getting co-authorship as a young researcher is not the norm, and is generous from the network, and so we basically shouldn’t push it.\n\nI am aware that a lot of young researchers don’t get authorship (and of the many flaws in the structure of academia)— but is that really the norm? I’ve come across multiple academics (albeit in different fields) that grant young researchers co-authorship— are those outliers? \n\nIt doesn’t seem fair to me, if anything it feels exploitative and limiting in advancing in a research career. But I’ve been told I’m a young researcher who doesn’t understand, so I want to know what the conventions are in academia so I know my rights!\n\nThanks!",

Worse, printing out that information for 5 members of staff to have on hand. \n\nThere are more. But the university does nothing.

        "text": "I'm a first year AI PhD student somewhere in Europe, and recently I've been having issues with my advisor; I'm hoping some of you can offer some advice!\n\nLong story short, I recently had the opportunity to learn about a new methodology in my field that few other people know how to use. I now have a bunch of ideas for how to apply this methodology to problems I've worked on previously. My secondary advisor is pretty excited about this new methodology, and the problems to which I plan to apply it.\n\nUnfortunately, my primary advisor is less enthused about my new direction. In his defense, it is a bit outside of his wheelhouse, though it's well within the scope of my overall project. \n\nHowever, his response to my new interests has caused me a lot of concern. For one, he insists that I apply my methodology to a specific domain because it interests him more. This struck me as odd: I'd happily change my direction if he had a scientific critique of it, but I don't particularly want to change my project based on his personal interests. Moreover, my experience with the methodology leads me to believe that it's a poor fit for his domain of interest.\n\nSo I suggested, as a compromise, that I pursue not only my project, but also a project that he would be happier supervising. To my surprise, he stated that he would \"choose to count only projects he supervised towards my thesis,\" even if my other project's content fit well with the rest of the thesis. It seemed like a big red flag to me that he would both refuse to supervise work that he found too far from his interests, and refuse to count work that he doesn't directly supervise toward my thesis. \n\nWhat should I do? I think that part of this problem comes from the fact that my advisor is very junior, and wants to collaborate very closely with me, his first student. In contrast, I find myself less interested in his research directions and close collaboration with him, and would probably be better matched with a more senior advisor who might take a more hands-off approach.\n\nWhat is a reasonable course of action here? Is my advisor's behavior normal? For reference, I wasn't hired to work on any specific project, and thought I would have a lot of research freedom.",

However, they have a personality quirk that will impede their career success, and I am looking for feedback on (1) whether it is any of my business to provide mentoring on this topic and (2) if so, how?\n\nThe quirk is that this person is the very definition of r/confidentlyincorrect. When they are confidently incorrect about a scientific fact, it is easy enough to firmly and neutrally correct them, and sometimes they accept the feedback and move on. \n\nOther times, they will confidently assert things that are a matter of opinion, or are frankly unknowable. And sometimes they twist into a pretzel trying to double down on their correctness (\"oh that word means something COMPLETELY different where I come from\"), especially when someone other than me corrects them. \n\nI had hoped that as they became a more seasoned and knowledgeable scientist they would grow out of this but if anything it seems to be getting worse instead of better. \n\nWhat is a mentor to do?",

We take it for granted now that the editor can access the documents we submit essentially instantaneously; it’s hard for me to imagine what it was like without this convenience. \n\nDid the editors send out letters to prospective reviewers or did they call them on their phone? \n\nMost journals I’ve published in ask the authors to review the galley proofs within 48 hours; was this just a lengthier process before?\n\nI’ve always been curious what life in academia was like before the technology we have now, but I’ve never really heard somebody explain what the submission/publication process was like. I guess I could just ask my advisor, but don’t want to just say, “How’d you publish articles back in the Stone Age when you started your career?” :P",

I know I'm capable of doing good research.\n\nI'm considering going home to India at the end of my degree and working at a Cancer research institute back home. Maybe teach for a year.\n\nObviously the resources and funding won't be the same as it is here but I think there are still skills I can pick up there that would be beneficial on a PhD application. I also feel like being close to home will help reset before going down the long PhD road.\n\nI already have a year of experience in cancer research (in India) from my Undergrad and will be getting 2 second author publications from those projects. \n\nAnd after a year, I want to come back to Europe for my PhD. \n\nHowever, I'm really worried that going back will negatively impact my chances at getting a PhD at a top institute. European PhDs aren't subject to the typical challenges of programs in the US with respect to NHS funding but I'm still unsure about how my application will be perceived.\n\nCould you guys share some insights please?",

(they did not as i found out later)\n\nwould this count as collusion? i know i fucked up pretty bad by speaking up but its done now so whatever.\n\nso they finish the code, printed it out, but i dont remember if they put it in the folders yet so it may be salvageable. \n\nnow naturally it only struck me when i got home and now im paranoid af that ill lose out on any qualifications from exams this year cos i kinda let them copy? even though i was completely blindsided at the start. the teacher was absent so i didnt rly have anyone to tell. \n\nso i kinda stalked their profiles on the online coding website we used and since everything is public i looked at their projects and theyre pretty much identical and im pretty sure the teacher would notice immediately.\n\nanyways next time we're in computing is on friday, next time i can speak to the teacher is thursday. should i tell the teacher what happened? or let him find out by himself and take action? what would be the best way to tell him without major consequences? im kinda prepared for a slap on the wrist or whatever but if it means i cant resit the exam or if i get my shit stripped from me someone is dying lol",

        "text": " \n\nHello guys,\n\nI don't know what to do but I really don't want to go work even it is completely related to what I did in my PhD and postdoc. I completed my PhD with several high-impact papers and spent two years as a postdoc at a university before deciding to move to a job in academia with just little higher pay but with stock options. Despite the lack of benefits compared to my previous job, I was excited to start my new role and worked extra hours without payment to contribute as much as possible to the company and potentially benefit in the future. However, after a year in the industry, I realized that I didn't enjoy the start-up or corporate environment.\n\nI initially believed that working hard and putting in extra hours would help me show my worth, but as time went on, I began to question why I was doing it when nobody else was. I was also promised opportunities to work in the lab in exciting projects, attend scientific conferences, and make academic contributions such as conference proceedings, presentations or papers, but none of these things materialized. I also found myself struggling with tasks related to profit and customer satisfaction and communicating with colleugues is hell sometimes. I must admit, I'm not a fan of company meetings, especially the kick-off ones where everyone seems to be trying to outdo one another. I've noticed that when we get a new purchase order, some people get really excited and start yelling things like 'yesss!' But for me, it doesn't really have the same effect.\n\nFurthermore, the company environment made me feel even more disconnected. I wasn't provided with healthcare or contributions to my retirement, but was offered perks like free coffee, ping-pong tables, and video games. I also have a stock options plan as I mentioned above. Although my work was appreciated, I didn't feel like I was making any scientific contributions, and often had to do tasks that were completely unrelated to my field of study, such as taking photos or videos. I like my bosses they are nice people but I feel like I am followed every minutes.\n\nI miss the free environment of the university where I could work in the lab without worrying about logging hours or following strict timelines. Overall, my experience has taught me that a good salary isn't everything, and that it's important to consider other factors such as job satisfaction and work-life balance. I'm not sure if I'm just being too picky or if other people feel the same way I do about things. Sometimes I find myself not quite satisfied with something, but I'm not sure if it's just me or if others have the same experience.\n\nI'm struggling with a decision about whether to stay in my current job until retirement or start considering going back to academia. On one hand, staying here would allow me to save more money for the future. On the other hand, returning to academia could provide me with more fulfilling work and a sense of purpose. I'm not quite sure what the best decision is yet. Has anyone else faced a similar dilemma? Any recommendations?",

        "text": "Hello academics,\n\nFirst post here. I'm working with an undergraduate volunteer on a research project. I gave them the task of doing a lit review on a topic-- finding and reviewing some relevant papers and writing up a coherent and cohesive summary of what they found. They sent me something that I thought was decent (but incomplete), certainly compared to my expectations for the amount of energy the student would put in. In conversation, AI search machine was mentioned and I got the sense that student used this for the lit review, which also explained why no additional papers were added to the lit review than the ones I sent them. Since I hadn't even know about this possibility, on the fly I mentioned that even though it seems helpful, it may be questionable ethically, but, more importantly, it does not promote the normal learning that happens when you read a bunch of papers, consider all the literature included, and write your own summary. Student said I have a point. Now I'm a little conflicted because the lit review was going to be used for a manuscript I'm working on (never verbatim, but hopefully a good basis to build upon), and I told the student that if they participate in the writing via the lit review, they will be included as a co-author. However, now I'm questioning if what they've done so far qualifies, if it's AI that spit it out. (That also explains why the lit review wasn't supper cohesive and mostly included summaries of the individual papers.) There are more parts to this assignment, so going forward I can give the student the opportunity to do things differently. \n\nAny thoughts on this? Thanks. \n\nP.S. I had to choose a flair; don't know if it's quite \"professional misconduct in research,\" but it seemed to be the closest option.",

        "text": " \n\nHello  Everyone! I initially drafted a very long post but have trimmed it down  significantly so if any additional info is needed I can provide in  comments. I live in the US if that is relevant, and I am open to  relocating anywhere in the US and potentially abroad.\n\nI  graduated with a BS in CyberSec in 2020. I immediately got a decent job  in IT that pays enough to support me and my partner despite being the  sole earner, which I have been working since. After working for this job  for a few years, I am sure that IT of any kind is not for me. I would  be fine working a job like this if I must but I would like to explore  higher education if I can.\n\nI truly  loved my time in college, and I have done a lot of soul-searching as to  why. I came to the conclusion that it was not the subject matter of my  major but rather the higher education experience in general. I was a  veteran attending college about 6 years behind, so I didn't do much  socially and was not a party person. I loved the process of learning and  being tested in that formal academic environment.\n\nInitially  I was looking into some online CyberSec masters programs, but thought  better of it since it is not a passion of mine, which seems to be a key  component for graduate education (I initially picked CyberSec due to  practicality and coming off of a tech-skilled military job). My absolute  favorite classes during my degree were Logic and Ethics, and I greatly  enjoy reading and talking philosophy as a hobby. So I have decided if I  am going to try graduate school, I think it is most likely for me to  feel the drive necessary for success in that field as opposed to my  current one.\n\nI have done a little  research here and elsewhere, and I see that job openings for Philosophy  are ridiculously competitive, and will usually require a PHD from a top  program to even be considered. I would like to stress that my goal here  is to undergo the process of higher education for it's own sake, with  the possibility of it resulting in a profession as a very small (but  appealing) possibility. If I completed just a few graduate  courses/masters/PHD and still ended up back in a normal IT job making  enough to live, I think I will be more fulfilled than I am now. I feel  like it will also be advantageous knowing I have my degree and work  experience in IT as a backup.\n\nSo  now for my very belated question: What is the most realistic path  available to me to go from a BS in CyberSec to graduate studies in  philosophy? I only have a few undergrad courses in that field, and I  doubt I have any way of getting competitive letters of recommendation.  If I want to have even a small chance at getting work, it seems I would  want to focus on attending a top program.\n\nCurrently  my working plan is to attend some graduate courses any way I can to  work towards meeting the prerequisites of a masters program and  hopefully rubbing shoulders with some professors that will write me  letters of recommendation. Is this realistic? Is there another path that  I am completely missing? Currently it seems like the Harvard extension  school may fit that requirement, though it is expensive and I am unsure  of the stigma around that school and how far that would get me towards a  masters program.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "So I, a business major sophomore in the US, have been working as an undergrad RA (research assistant) for a professor since last summer, and until recently, I thought we had a good working relationship. In a prior meeting, he said that I am good at my job, that is, very efficient at tasks, delivering great work, asking good questions, and bringing insightful thoughts and ideas to the table. Also, he has supported me in finding grants for my own and first research project and wrote a recommendation letter on my behalf, which went through. He also introduced me to his colleagues and network, which led me to land a undergrad fellowship position and work on an inter-university project.\n\nThis semester, he is acting as my informal mentor for my research project, and early in the semester, we have established a timeline of goals to keep us on track. Unfortunately, after establishing the timeline, my mom became suddenly ill due to a flare-up of her cancer, causing me to push my research tasks down my priority list for two weeks, as I have to take care of her, causing me not meeting our informal deadlines (she is now doing better and I can refocus on my RA work and project). I didn't tell him my situation as I thought telling him about my personal life was inappropriate. During my \"downtime,\" he shared with me several articles via email, as a way to check in with me, I suspect, and finally, I told him that I won't be able to complete some of the tasks for my project by our agreed timeline, but I will get it done asap (I never missed a deadline as a RA and usually turn in my work early, so this is uncharacteristic of me). \n\nSince then, after sending that email and turning in my project deliverables about a half week later, he hasn't given me any new tasks to do for my RA work, provided me feedback on my work like he usually does, nor have responded to my weekly follow-up/catch-up emails for the last three weeks, where I keep him in the loop regarding my project, sharing articles with him, asking for new RA tasks, and then asking for a meeting, which concerns me.\n\nSo I'm feeling a bit blindsided and unsettled by the radio silence, as this is uncharacteristic of him (he usually gets back to me within a day), and I am worried that our professional relationship is falling apart. I am also autistic (the professor doesn't know this) so I worried that my lack of communication prior or my email may have accidentally hurted/slighted him, and I don't know how should I proceed interpersonal wise.\n\n**What should I do to get in contact with him and repair our relationship if that is the case, as we planned to co-first a future publication together, and I need a recommendation letter from him for my other grants and scholarship and future programs/positions? At worst, how can I proceed with my project without him, as a giant portion of my project requires his industry contacts and data?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr**: I work with a professor as a RA, and he served as an informal mentor for my own research project. I didn't complete my project deliverables by an informal deadline as my mom became suddenly sick, and I devoted time to take care of her. After this, he became unresponsive, making me worried as I planned my immediate career future around him, and my project depended on his contacts and data. I'm looking for advice on how to reestablish contact with him and repair our relationship if necessary.",

        "text": "I was a TA for a large university in mathematics. What I saw completely was completely disappointing. Our school had a policy of always giving second attempts to take exams in algebra or pre-calculus \"because learning math is a challenge\". I graded for calculus and maybe half of the students who passed actually understood the material and could take a derivative. The rest were  a bunch of idiots who earned some class participation and got saved by a curve because again \"math is hard\". You really can't understand ANY of the physical sciences without a firm understanding of calculus, so these people are watering down the value of science degrees because apparanly you don't even need to properly understand the actual subject to get them. People graduating mechanical engineering programs who don't know how to deal with instantaneous rates of change just because they had their hand held. Crazy. Getting a degree in STEM should not be merely about convincing a professor you put a (little bit) of effort in. It was crazy the mathematical blunders \"STEM\" people would make and still be allowed to pass and continue with their degree. I am talking about people who don't know what \"x\" is and they are still somehow passing calculus with the curves \n\nThe grading scale was practically like this:\n\nA: understood the material\n\nB: Major gaps in their understanding and arguably didn't understand the material, but they were able to write something that looked like math.  \n\nC: Completely misunderstood the material but at least they tried! \n\nD: Wrote something down \n\nF: no show",

It will be a one year program and I want to jump right into a PhD after, so I really need to start contacting potential advisers ASAP, which means I most likely need to have at least an idea of what I want to do. Obviously, I'll need to have my RQ ready to write up proposals for my applications this Fall.   \n\n\nI have a pretty solid group of research interests thanks to an undergrad thesis and scholarship/fellowship applications, but I'm not sure how they would transfer over to a PhD. Basically in applying to my MA programs my 'research goals' were essentially decolonizing the discipline and exploring the merit of combining two research methods, but I did not have an actual research subject - my thought process was I can find interest in anything, my primary goal is to explore a subject through the lens of two theoretical / methodological frameworks.   \n\n\nMy question is, is that enough for a PhD application? Or do I need to have my methods / theory as well as a subject of a study prepared when I am applying for a PhD?   \n\n\nIf this was unclear in any way I can definitely answer any clarifying questions.

For the sake of this post, let’s just pretend like I can do it.\n\nMy main concern is getting research experience to become a competitive applicant. My wife starts PA school this August, so we are going to be in the area I am currently at for at very least one year, and more likely two—this depends on her clinical rotations and where she gets placed. It’s at that point (two years from august), that i will likely have the opportunity to take a job to get research experience. \n\nI have looked at the predoc website and the bulk of the top schools expect research experience and coding skill to land a position. How can I prepare for that in the next two years with limited time (I work full time)?\n\nIdeas\n—teach myself R in my spare time\n—volunteer research (although I am currently doing this)\n\n\nPlease help!

I did overcome other challenges which are common to other databases (this is recorded). \n\nBut I do not unerstand how for some companies the data was changed without keeping a track record or making a statement.
