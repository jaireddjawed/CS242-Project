        "text": "Hey gang - so sorry if this is below the threshold for this sub. I went back to school last year and just last month I finished my Statistics final and THE NEXT DAY hopped on a plane to Vegas for work. \n\nWhile flying I got to thinking about this gambling strategy - the Labouchere system (sometimes called the Cancellation method). Effectively the gambler has a list of values (usually between 7 and 12 numbers) whose sum is the total amount they aim to win. Each attempt they gamble the sum of the first and last number on the list. If they win, they cross off the numbers for the values they won, and if they loose, they dont cross off anything and instead add the amount that they lost as a new number to the end of the list. This does two things - it effectively amortizes the amount that they lost over more turn (unlike the \"doubling method\"' where the gambler doubles their loosing bet), and it also makes it so over time, the gambler only needs to win [(quantity of numbers on the list)+(amount of times the lost)]/2 times. In theory, provided the gambler has unlimited bankroll, they would only have to win 34% on the time to win their desired amount. \n\nIn the real world, of course, people dont have an unlimited bankroll. As I was bored on the flight, I wanted to see what I could learn about this betting scheme and see if I could come up with the probability it would be successful with a fixed max amount in losses and a goal quantity to win. \n\nI was able to come up with a surprising amount of info, but I am not sure the conclusions I am drawing are accurate and I was wondering if someone can point me in the right direction. \n\nI abatriaily picked numebers that felt like something one might use in the real world: Goal Winnings of $100 (10 number of 10 each so the starting and min bet was $20), and a max loss of $300. After playing with these numbers a bit on the flight I was able to figure out the amount of wins require to reach our goal, and the amount of losses that would bankrupt us (seems to be 7 more than our wins regardless of the quantity of total bets). \n\nWith these in mind, I was able to determine the probability that a set of a given number of tries resulted in one of the three possible states (Won / Loss / Continuing to play because neither has occurred yet) using binomial distributions. I even graphed the likelihood a win or loss would occur with the X axis as number of plays. \n\nI think my question is, are my claims valid? Anecdotally - I can imagine a situation where a string of 20 play starts off with 5 or 6 wins (enough to cause the gambler to reach their goal and then stop playing) however the remaining turn result in losses such that at the end of 20 they would be in  the loss column. Is there a way to set up a random walk diagram/analysis with thresholds that cause the walk to Stop? \n\nAgain - clearly I am just a new statistics user, but I am really fascinated by these concepts and I paged through the text book for that course and didnt find what I am looking for so any help would be great!

It, therefore, follows that large values of the log-likelihood statistic indicate poorly fitting statistical models, because the larger the value of the log-likelihood, the more unexplained observations there are.\"\n\nSo, which is actually true?

I'm looking at the case attributes for this missing audio to see if there's a pattern, but it doesn't appear so (at least not with the outcome):\n\nOutcome 0/1 on the top, Missing audio 0/1 on the side\n\n         0  1\n      0 23  5\n      1 25  8\n\n\nSo I wanted to ask for your guidance concerning the sampling integrity:\n\nIf the audio files are missing at random (tbd, looking at other variables now), can I just run another random sample to fill in the 28 cases that were missing?  Or is there something additional that I should do to account for the missingness in the original random selection? \n\nI used sample() in R to get the original sample list and set a seed to reproduce it so I can manipulate it easily enough and document the steps and excluded cases.  \n   \nThanks in advance for any advice, suggestions, or resources.  I'm realizing that this is kind of a blind spot for me that I'd like to improve.\n\n\n**EDIT:** \nAs I'm thinking through this more, could I treat the first sample of n=61 as a sample to discover the non-response rate (for lack of a better word-- what would you call this?) and then follow-up with a random sample of 110 (NR = .459) or so to get back to the target of 61 audios?  \n\n\n**EDIT 2**\nI over-sampled based on the initial missing rate, looked at 113 cases and found 60 audios.\n\nNo SES variables were significant on missingness in the first sample pull; BUT it turned out after creating some timing variables to cross on missing audio cases, most occurred at a point in patient care where the audio would not have been collected (phone call would not have been made).  I subset out this portion of the data (the focus is on the phone calls) and still have a similar missing rate of .42.  Not sure what this means.  The time variable describes the missing audio, but subsetting doesn't improve the rate?\n\n\n",

Everything else is the same. \nAfter analysis, the protein expression of cells receiving treatment A  would be set to 1 and the protein expression of the cells that received treatment B would be the relative fold change compared to cells that obtained treatment A after normalizing to a protein whose expression would not be altered by the treatment. \n\nSay I would get the following hypothetical values:\n\nTreatment A: 1, 1, 1\nTreatment B: 2.1, 1.9, 2.6\n\nNow my question is which statistical test to use:\n\nI was thinking of a paired T test since the cells of each individual experiment are the same at the start of the experiment.

When they first begin, the buyers input their preferences for 3 questions (time, quality, cost) on a 10 point scale. 5 is average and is the expected amount. The buyer can bump a preference score above 5, but to do so, they have to reduce one of the other numbers (total can only be 15). \n\n3. When the buyer uses a specific supplier and the transaction has been completed, they rate the supplier on the same, 3 categories. \n\n4. Based on their previously given preferences, I want my system to use this supplier rating and compare it to their originally given preferences to determine a true rating of the supplier. \n\nI've tried using the deviation from \"5\" as a multiplier, I've also tried using the raw number. (eg. if I do not care about price and give is a \"1\" on the 10 point scale- it multiples the rating by 1 but if I do care, if would multiply it by 10.)\n\nI'm stuck on this,,, any ideas or suggestions?",

Each column represents the pollen count for each plant.\n\nThe pollen count is represented as positive integers. It contains however a lot of \"zero\" values, where there was nothing in the air as pollen are usually only active during a short period.\n\nAdditionally, the range of the values is dependent on plant.\n\nSo I would like to normalise the values to have something that ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`, where `1.0` represents 100% of the typical pollen-concentration. Everything that's over that typical maximum is considered to be `1.0`.\n\nThe issue here is the word _typical_.\n\nI have uploaded a simple data-set [to pastebin](https://pastebin.com/Fjw0A5mY).\n\nWhen I look at the distribution, it is _strongly_ skewed toward `0`, even if I remove the `0` values. And you can also see many outliers to the right.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I would like to find a \"typical\" maximum for those values. Not the \"absolute\" maximum.\n\nI could additionally remove rows of dates where the plant is usually inactive to get rid of a lot of `0` values. I have not done that yet, assuming that simply eliminating the `0` values would be a good-enough estimation for now.",

As this is a hypothetical question, don't come at me for not being celibate. \n\nWhat are the odds of finding a woman who ticks all my boxes, if I'm not looking for her? I'm looking for a very rough estimate. Also, it would be nice if you could compare it to another group of people (i.e. \"It's just as likely that you find a professional soccer player\"). \n\nI have some basic needs in a woman: \n- Eastern Orthodox, maybe Catholic. I've read studies that marriages are best when the two agree on basic issues, and it would be nice to have someone to share a liturgical life with. \n- Pious. As in, I want to be able to share my spiritual life with her, and it's hard to do that if she's only nominally Christian, and doesn't really have a spiritual life in the technical Orthodox sense of the term. \n- Preferrably introverted. \n\nI did some math and collected some statistics but idk how good my math is. \n\nTotal US population is 325,700,000. \n\nLGB population is 5% of entire population. 325,700,000 x .05=16,285,000. Source: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/26/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-americans-differ-from-general-public-in-their-religious-affiliations/?amp=1 \n\nFirst, we'll look at how many LGB women are reasonably within my age range. Of LGB women, 27% are 18-24 and 27% are 25-39. 16,285,000 x .27 x 2=8,793,900. Source: https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/visualization/lgbt-stats/?topic=LGBT\n\n17% of the LGB population is Catholic. 8,793,900 x .17=1,494,963. \"Other Christian\" is 2%, so we'll estimate that .5% of the population is Orthodox. 8,793,900 x .005=43,970. So 1,494,963 Catholics + 43,970 Orthodox=1,538,933. Source: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/26/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-americans-differ-from-general-public-in-their-religious-affiliations/?amp=1\n\nTo show piety, we'll look at weekly church attendance. Among all Americans (including non-LGB), 39% of Catholics go to church every Sunday. We'll assume LGB rates are similar. 1,494,963 Catholics x .39=583,035. 26% of Orthodox go to church regularly, but we'll up that to 40% because I'd guess not many LGB folks are nominally Orthodox; it's just too hard to be gay and Orthodox. 43,970 Orthodox x .4=17,588. So 583,035 + 17,588=600,623. However, church attendance is not everything. She needs to be willing to wait until marriage. Although 20% of people in highly religious groups wait, 60% of women wait until marriage. Since religious reasons are the main reason to wait, we'll use the 60% statistic. 600,623 x .6=360,374. Sources: https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5acd082ae4b06a6aac8c7506/amp and http://hirr.hartsem.edu/research/EightFactsAboutChurchAttendance.pdf and https://www.statisticbrain.com/abstinence-statistics/ \n\nWe'll look at what personalities would go well with mine. I'm not really picky, I just need to be able to connect. I'm INFP and so I have always connected best with iNtuitives. The number of iNtuitive people is 26.7% of the population. .27 x 360,374=97,301. Source: http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/my-mbti-results/how-frequent-is-my-type.htm?bhcp=1 \n\nNow let's look at reciprocity. We'll estimate 50% of Orthodox/Catholic LGB girls to represent who is not celibate. 97,301 x .5=48,651. Then we'll use 10% of that to represent people I am attracted to and who are attracted to me.

        "text": "In this case I have the result of successful treatment (from 3 separate studies of the same drug) in form of percentage. For example, 70%, 90% and 100%.\nThe problem is the research designs are really different from each other. Some are clinical trials while some are cohort studies or even real-world studies. Not to mention the treatment duration are slightly different and so as general characteristic of the patient.\nAnd I have 5 different drugs to compare with each other and I obtained 3 studies of each drug. It would be nice to be able to provide the conclusion, like, Drug A vs drug B with pooled mean of 88% vs 93% respectively. Or things like that.\nI'm not very strict about getting extreme high quality averages as long as it's not wrong statistically. I just want to obtain some solid figures, to be specific, numbers.\nCan I do the pooled mean? Like, just bluntly calculated the mean percentage of each drug? Alternate ideas are also greatly appreciated.",
