What you will need to decipher the message.  A flexible mind that is observant \\(attention to subtle visual &amp; auditory details\\). The ability to analyze information and connect the dots. The ability to recognize and interpret symbolism.  Be aware that the United States is one of a very few nations on Earth that teach the language of the arts/the language of symbolism to the public.  People are introduce to literature and poetry in the 12th grade.  That's 11 years of preparing the minds of U.S. citizens with the necessary prerequisite knowledge of grammar, vocabularies, syntax, idioms, etc... just to be able to learn the language of the arts.

Most of the users stuck in the early game and complain. Our opinion is that the game is for anyone who wants to spend time with it. The game is : [Abstract](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dgk.riddles) \n\nThanks!!! Feel free to review the game and answer our questions!",
