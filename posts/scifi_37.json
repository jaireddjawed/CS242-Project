Are there any novels/ books you can recommend that involve dark energy as one of its themes, no matter how realistic or unrealistic you think it is? I am grateful for any suggestions \\^\\^",

I remember it being like one of Robert Sheckley's classics, but I don't think he wrote it.\n\nA human (I'll call him \"Smith\" here) is out exploring the galaxy in his one-man ship when he ends up permanently stranded on a distant planet. It's a pleasant enough place and the humanoid natives are friendly, so he makes the best of it, takes a native name (\"Baratu\" or whatever) settles down, lives out the rest of his life and dies. But. Before dying, he realizes that sooner or later someone from Earth will officially discover the place, and so he carefully coaches his hosts on what do when that happen.\n\nAnd sure enough, after Smith is gone, another larger expedition arrives and contact is made. The villain of the piece is a human who schemes to swindle the natives out of their planet and turn it into a resort colony for trillionaires, or somesuch. Because of Smith, the natives know exactly which bureaucratic hoops to jump through to get the planet declared the Baratu Galactic Wildlife Refuge. The villain skulks off defeated, and a sympathetic human who has witnessed all of this says to a native that they should have named it the Smith Galactic Wildlife Refuge. The native's reply is the last line of the story: \"Smith? Who is Smith?\"",

        "text": " In one of my reddit posts I told you about a strange being I came up with called \"The Twilight\". A being as old as the universe itself, looking to make deals with mortals in order to cause mischief wherever he goes, due to certain rules set in place by the great gods above him.\n\nHeres a little script I came up with him narrating the first chapter in a story.\n\n\"You know a few people who chose to be great writers end up writing a lot of good stories that sell for millions on the open market. They have good plotlines. writing structure, characters, and development which makes it all the worth reading. But, tell me have you ever wondered how they are able to come up with such great ideas for their work. Does it come naturally, or is it apart of the special talent they have, or could it come from another source. Allow me to answer your question\". He turn to one of the eyes of his domain. They were called \"The eyes of reality\", that see all the many places throughout the universe. He asks one of the eyes to show the place of dreams. The eye blinked, then opened up showing a brightly lit realm filled with swirling shades of purple, dark blue and yellow almost like a canvas.\n\nThis place you see is called \"The Zone\" a place where all dreams and nightmares flow throughout the Multiverse. It is also where all the events that happened across each Universe echo across reality for others to hear when they sleep. It's here that artists and writers with an imaginative mind are able to connect and discover the inspiration need for their work.\n\nOne particular instance I'll introduce is a book written by a famous author of the 1950s. This book involved a future where robots were supposed to help humans on Earth following three important laws in their existence. That author was Isaac Asimov, his book was titled I Robot. It showed what his vision could have been for the future. What the world would be like in machines and humans could live together. Of course this inspiration didn't come to him overnight. He was feeling something that few mortals on could sense. Perhaps you like to know.\n\nOur story begins in a place on another Earth. It's here that Humanity created its own fancy future in the early 50's or something. They have all the things you can imagine, flying cars, space travel and robots so on and so forth. It was good for a while until something happened and things went a little crazy over there. How you ask, let's just say yours truly was responsible for that. Now I know you're wondering how I did it. Allow me to tell you the tale. Submitted for your approval.\n\nSo yeah what do you think?",

And thank you if you DO answer. \n\nMost situations about space and ships are hypothetical, still, if you see a mistake in what I've written (especially one where I'd get lambasted) please let me know. \n\nSo, weapons on the exterior of a ship could technically be fired independent of each other providing there are two of a type. For some types of weapons, a ship may only need one. Like a railgun. And that gun would be positioned in a way that gave it the most range of motion. When installing a gun, it requires external connections that may only be accessible from the exterior of the ship, like some of its wiring. \n\nA railgun is an electrical gun, so it's wired into the electrical system. But even a gun that's reliant on a chemical reaction requires being wired into the ship's electrical system so that it can be fired from the bridge. \n\nBut would your weapons system be on the same circuit or whatever (I don't know the word) so that they would aim at the same time and answer to the same commands when targeting? But you would select which one fires separately? And is there a situation where repairs to the guns would need to be done externally, like exposed, broken wiring from damage or whatnot? \n\nOR are ships always built in a way that wiring is run through a layer (again, what word goes here?) that's always accessible from inside the ship?\n\nAlso, where is the ordnance loaded? I'm sure I've seen this in my favorites series, but what does a small ship do? Like a ship like Serenity... \n\nMy ship mechanic is on vacation and so I can't ask him. And tracking this down also seems ridiculous because it's so hypothetical anyway and most answers are based on what exists in popular TV series.",

Its greatest weakness for me was that it didn’t grab me emotionally and so it was a solid 7.5/10 for me. \n\nAfter that I figured I would watch the original film since I liked the sequel. I had to force myself to finish it. Aside from an interesting premise and world I genuinely do not think there are many if any exceptional qualities about it. Everything except for the premise and world is either average or straight up bad imo. Am I in the minority? Why do people like this movie so much?",

The writing was lacking, there was very little imagination beyond visuals, plot holes galore, etc. So, with the new one coming out, I’m hearing lots of good things, but I don’t want to waste my time if it’s just another “visual masterpiece.” I think visuals are important, but if there aren’t good characters and story to back it up, I lose interest after the first few frames. \n\nI also wasn’t a fan of the politics of the original, or many movies coming out now, so if that’s a big element, then I wouldn’t be interested in it either. Movies are an escape from reality, so having to watch a movie sky someone’s political views is downright boring if not frustrating. \n\nSo, for those who hated avatar, but watched the new one anyway, is it worth it?",

        "text": "By the third episode of *The Orville*, we watched what is known as a TV bait and switch. The only difference being that, unlike modern entertainment, this particular switcheroo was positive.\n\n*The Orville* is a crafty beast. A multi-themed ship, flown like a cloaked Klingon vessel, right under the nose of the audience. The cast, complete with a TNG Worf wannabe and a Data clone could be viewed on first glance as generic joke vessels, there to dole out the gags and that’s all. But there is a unique aspect to the show. As you watch you realize that the crew of The Orville could be you. They like the same music and come from the same places. The alien races look different but face many of the same problems that we do. It is set in space but grounded in relatable reality. \n\nThe viewer also gets to see what happens behind the scenes in a spaceship series, with the families of the crew presented in a unique and revealing way. You see the crew relaxing. That’s never really been shown before. Who knew what happened when a ‘shift ended’ as any given ship hurtled through space? [https://getwokeup.com/the-orville-blasts-off-with-potential-fourth-season/](https://getwokeup.com/the-orville-blasts-off-with-potential-fourth-season/)",
