It was working fine for days. \n\nThen for some reason I needed windows, so I plugged in my windows SSD. God damn it gave BSOD all the time. Blue screen as we all know of. I thought the CPU was faulty at first. But how so? It worked perfectly on linux for days? I was just downloading games from steam, 5 minute passes, BAM! It gives BSOD. What? I have never seen such a thing happen at all, in my 30 years of computing. Then I thought maybe the TPM thing is responsible for this. I researched about it. Because on BIOS it asks me \"new cpu installed wanna reset fTPM blah blah\" so I went ahead and  disabled the TPM. It gives no BSOD at all right now. Even I played Doom Eternal for 2 hours on Windows just to test it. No BSOD.\n\nSeriously what a fucking shit. Linux devs please don't enable this TPM thing in the future.",

Only way I could use wifi is if I re-installed windows (Yes, secureboot was turned off). All the hardware showed up, it just wouldn't connect regardless of how many times I prayed to the big systemctl in the sky.\n\nThe issue being the kernel not find the appropriate drivers (iwlwifi-QuZ-a0-jf-b0-64.ucode through iwlwifi-QuZ-a0-jf-b0-72.ucode). I did everything and tried everything, read and re-read the same posts, installed different distros, rolled back the kernel, installed drivers from sus sites (Probably got free malware too) ran every main stream distro, tinkered with various bios settings, each time only to be met with utter despair.\n\nThere was, however, one setting in bios I never touched and that was the **lock wireless** setting. I always disregarded it, \"Why would I want to lock wireless?\" thought my inner caveman. I decided to turn it on this time. Threw in my manjaro usb and I could finally connect to WiFi. In utter disbelief I thought it was just a fluke and that Manjaro was the silver bullet (It's pretty much arch, btw) I then ran through all the other distros in my ever growing drawer of iso's, each and everyone worked. I probably spent 20-30 hours troubleshooting this over the past year, all because I ignored the **lock wireless** bios setting.\n\nTL/DR: If your HP ProBook 450 G8 can't connect to wifi, turn on the **lock wireless** button.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA humbled Linux user",

        "text": "I would like to share a script that I think can be quite useful for people who play games in DOSBox, or want to extract the OST from games (works with console games too that use CD audio). All that's required is to pass the CUE file as an argument to the script.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI linked it before as part of a collective post about a bunch of my scripts. Since I made that post, I've spent a lot of time refining everything so my scripts can reach their 'final form'. The goal is to have them in such a state that I could die tomorrow and they will keep working indefinitely, and be easy to understand and maintain should people need to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis specific script seems to be the last of the bunch to get its 'final makeover'. I might still update it, but I don't think I will change it a whole lot more. The one thing that comes to mind is to add support for additional audio formats, like Opus, MP3 etc. The reason I didn't add it myself yet is because I'm not interested. I always just use FLAC, and Ogg Vorbis is there as a lossy option. DOSBox supports Opus though, so maybe someone will be interested in forking the script and adding that, I don't know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListing the top comments of the script below, to elaborate on how it works:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# This script is meant to take an input BIN/CUE file, extract the raw\n\n\\# track(s) (data / audio) in whatever format the user has specified\n\n\\# through script arguments. The script simply separates all the tracks\n\n\\# of BIN/CUE files.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Available audio formats are:\n\n\\# \\* cdr (native CD audio)\n\n\\# \\* ogg (Ogg Vorbis)\n\n\\# \\* flac (Free Lossless Audio Codec)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# If no format is specified as an argument, the script will extract all\n\n\\# 3 formats, and create CUE sheets for all 3 formats as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The original purpose of the script is to take DOS games that have CD\n\n\\# audio, and getting rid of the need to store the uncompressed audio.\n\n\\# Ogg Vorbis is a lossy codec, so the files are much smaller and near\n\n\\# the same quality. In the case of FLAC, it's a lossless format so the\n\n\\# quality is identical to native CD audio. The only difference is FLAC\n\n\\# is losslessly compressed so the files are slightly smaller. The\n\n\\# generated CUE sheets can be used with DOSBox, using the 'IMGMOUNT'\n\n\\# command.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# [https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/IMGMOUNT](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/IMGMOUNT)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Another use case for this script is to simply extract the OST from\n\n\\# games, to listen to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The script will work with all kinds of games, including PS1 and Sega\n\n\\# Saturn games. All that's required is that the disc image is in the\n\n\\# BIN/CUE format. Though, I'm not sure if there's emulators that can\n\n\\# handle FLAC or Ogg Vorbis tracks. The point would mainly be to listen\n\n\\# to the music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Yet another use case is to just split a BIN/CUE into its separate\n\n\\# tracks, with the '-cdr' argument, without encoding the audio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# It's possible to do a byteswap on the audio tracks (to switch the\n\n\\# endianness / byte order), through the optional '-byteswap' argument.\n\n\\# This is needed in some cases, or audio tracks will be white noise if\n\n\\# the endianness is wrong. So, it's easy to tell whether or not the byte\n\n\\# order is correct.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# ISO files produced by 'bchunk' are discarded, and data tracks are\n\n\\# instead copied directly from the source BIN file, calculating the\n\n\\# length of tracks based on information gathered from the CUE sheet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Since the 'copy\\_track' function is now able to correctly copy any\n\n\\# track from the source BIN file, it's possible to make this script not\n\n\\# depend on 'bchunk' anymore. The default mode is to use 'bchunk', but\n\n\\# if the user passes the '-sox' argument to the script, then 'sox' is\n\n\\# used instead. The end result is identical either way. It's just nice\n\n\\# to have a way out, in case a certain program is not available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The advantage of using the '-sox' argument, is that the script is then\n\n\\# able to process CUE sheets that contain multiple FILE commands (list\n\n\\# multiple BIN files). As an example, Redump will use 1 BIN file /\n\n\\# track, so that can be processed by the script directly in this case,\n\n\\# without having to merge the BIN/CUE first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# It may also be possible to use 'ffmpeg' in a similar way to how 'sox'\n\n\\# is used in the 'cdr2wav' function. But I did not manage to get it\n\n\\# working. The command would probably be something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# ffmpeg -i in.cdr -ar 44.1k -ac 2 -f pcm\\_s16le out.wav",

It seems for high throughput database applications, alot of sysops prefer the XFX file system. Any thoughts on EXT4 vs XFX filesystems in terms of optimal performance for a full Ethereum node? After a bit of research, I ruled out both BTRFS and ZFS file systems which seems to optimize more for data integrity via additional mechanisms such as frequent checksums as opposed to speed.",

        "text": "TL;DR: I've been a linux user for quiet some time now, and one thing has been a constant throughout the years. Nvidia has ALWAYS been extremely difficult to get working proberly, and it's always been a matter of compromises. So trying the new 530.30.02 beta drivers today, and seing that they just worked out of the box, with no configuration, and little to no bugs (that are noticable in a day to day use), brought a small tear to my eye. \n\nMany people, including myself,  have been sceptical about nvidia's open 'open sourcing' of their drivers, but maybe they ARE actually starting to turn around, and care for the linux community? I still reserve the rights to be sceptical, after all one good release doesn't neccesarily means that this is the new standard, but one can always hope!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNormally this would be some sort of long winded ramble from me, on how nothing ever works with nvidia, and probably concluding on the famous words 'freak you nvidia'.... But not today though. Today I probably for the first time in my life have to say 'Thank you Nvidia'.\n\nI have the Zephyrus G14, which is an AMD based nvidia-optimus laptop. It runs arch, and I'm currently rocking a custom hyprland rice (wayland). Getting nvidia to work on this has always been a chor, but looking at the latest release logs, i decided to uninstall all nvidia, reboot (to give it the absolute best shot), and then just run the installer. Didn't even reboot afterwards, i just modprobed the new driver in, and BAM! it actually just works.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Suspend and resuming now happens without crashes/100% CPU utilization. Sure it can happen a bit faster, but my god, it's actually possible now\n\n\\- Tearing is reduced by like a gagillion percent. It's almost not noticable anymore (even on external display)\n\n\\- Finally high refreshrate monitors are probably supported, also if they have different refreshrates, resolutions, and even scaling factors.\n\n\\- Displays are actually just plug and play now. As far as I've observed so far, there's no more bugging out, no more freezing, no more nvidia just deciding to take an angry nab... It just works\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerformance is also greatly improved (For opengl... we don't talk about vulkan) and power states are also finally fixed, allowing me to actually just leave my laptop in hybrid, since it doesn't drain any more battery now, than it otherwise would.",

I didn't even have to choose the highest resolution. It just started up with the best resolution. \n\nI'm installing Windows 10 in a VM because I may need it for work (now I'm hoping not because I don't want to have to pay for this BS!). Also, I told it that I was not interested in MS 365 and I was hoping to never have to see or hear from that again... Nope, I just got a popup during an update saying don't forget to grab MS 365... \n\nI can honestly say, I do not miss Windows at all! What a frigging joke! And they SELL this garbage and people buy it because it's Windows... Oooooh! Windows!!!! Gotta have it!\n\nI LOVE Linux! Plain and simple. I'm hoping I can just get rid of this VM.
