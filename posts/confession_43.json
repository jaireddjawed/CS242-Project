        "text": "when i was younger my dad used to date a woman, i’ll call her hannah. hannah used to be really nice to me, she used to read me stories and draw with me for hours. one day she started to abuse me and force me to shower when i got to my dads house even if i had already showered at my mothers house. i started to cry to try and call out for help and get my dad to notice that whenever hannah was around i was crying but he never noticed and instead he just screamed at me for crying. one day i wouldn’t stop crying and he got sick of it. so he burned my favourite teddy in the fire and forced me to sit infront of the fireplace and watch the teddy burn until it was completely gone. this teddy was my favourite teddy because it looked just like the old dog we had who sadly passed away. it was the only thing i had that could remind me of her. one day i had enough and i asked to go home they called my mother and when my mother showed up she began to scream at them in the middle of the street. i didn’t see my dad for 2 years after that. when i finally decided to go back to my dad i found out after everything he was still going out with hannah and he had 2 children with them. eventually he left her and we never saw my brother and sister again. i hope they’re okay, if she was able to do that to someone who wasn’t even her child, imagine what she does to her children. i don’t think it’s fair that i now have to live with all this trauma and she still thinks she done nothing wrong. she told my dad that she never lay a finger on me when i have multiple scars on my body because of her.",

        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 16-17M I had a drinking problem. I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. \n\n2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. She did not object to this so I thought I was on the next stage of flirting. I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. Eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted. I feel as though if I was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn’t get aggressive or violent when rejected. After this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that I fucked up and that no means no. I probably freaked her out bad. I didn’t understand what I was doing and I thought I was flirting but I got it horribly wrong and upset someone \n\nEveryone alienated me after this, all 4 people involved stopped talking to me. My friend was extremely angry with me and started calling me a harasser. \nDue to the response provided I have false memories of what happened. I only asked for a kiss but my mind keeps telling me that I groped/raped her because of how angry everyone was after the situation. I live in constant mental imprisonment. \nI know for a fact I had no bad intentions but in my drunken state I got it horribly wrong. \n\n\n\n When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. \nLooking back it was quite s lame apology, I said some shit like “I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable last night I was really drunk” i didn’t know what to say\nShe told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. I don’t know if she just said this to make me feel better or what not but yeah. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience. It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven’t done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. \n\nAfter I apologised I didn’t think too much of the incident, but 18 months later for some reason it’s come back into my mind and it’s all I think about 24/7. I really can’t understand why I did what I did. I certainly wouldn’t have done it sober, but I’ve realised that it’s no excuse. Their friend said to my friend it wasn’t that much of a big deal but I still can’t forget about it. \nI feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other person’s consent. I was verbally asking for consent but I was being pushy about it. \nSince this has been of my mind, I haven’t allowed myself to have anormal life, I’ve since quit my job and I hardly leave my room. I feel as though this is who I’m gonna be forever. That drunk idiot that kept asking. I told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasn’t a big deal. I can’t even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way I treated a woman that night. No charges were ever pressed or anything, idk if I did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral. \nI don’t know if asking for a kiss more than once is illegal (might fall under harassment) \nBut I feel I should’ve received some punishment for my actions \nI hate myself for it every day and I’ve been thinking about ending my life over this. Once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back. \n\n\nAlthough im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go. This haunts me 24/7 and honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself for it. \nI thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that I wasn’t. \n\nI’m a pig. A disgusting man who ignored boundaries. I’m sorry to all women that have to deal w shit like this. I’ve heard some horror stories from some other girls and the stuff u have to put up with us disgusting. I wouldn’t consider myself a part of that domain but this encounter proves otherwise. \n\nI physically cry my eyes out when I see my mother. I’ve failed her, she told me to respect women growing up and I fucked it.",

I’ve been a drunk man and a sober man and I can safely say the idea of being drunk is better than being drunk itself. \nThe shit I see fully grown men do under the influence is pathetic, fighting, getting verbally abusive, getting creepy and feeling up girls and I know people who have told me they frequently get behind the wheel under the influence. \nPlus the cost of alcohol is a joke, people damage their bank accounts so much from this. \nI just see no benefits from drinking. It does t even have a good short term affect on you, and I think ur boring if u NEED alcohol to have fun. \n\nI know I sound pretentious as fuck, but this is how I genuinely feel about alcohol and I think it is demonic and destroys and brainwashed our society.",

        "text": "I did a lot of terrible things in my life and really i'm so sorry for everything i have done. Here's the list of the things i have done:\n- When i was a kid around 10 and 12 years old (I'm almost 23 now) when i was angry sometimes i used to press my feet to the paws of my dog until she was feeling hurt or sometimes i hit her with a stick but not strong \n- when i was around 16 years old i was in a hospital and was taking a photo of a girl under her skirt, she noticed so i didn't do anything \n- Next year i was on a street and i took a photo of a girl and jerked off to it when i was at home alone\n- Last year i was working in a association who takes care of disabled people and one day i had to take care of a disabled girl all alone and i was working on the garden near a campfire, she sat on the floor so i cleaned her by touching her pants several times and i think i even groped her butt... later that day i had to piss so i went to the bathroom but i couldn't leave her all alone otherwise she would have run away so we entered together and while i was pissing i got hard and she saw my penis and i swear i didn't do anything else and to be honest i don't know if she even understood what happened there because she has mental disabilities and doesn't even speak.\n- Again last year i stole from my mother about 1700-2000$ and used the money for porn, When i will get a job i will give back all the money to her i swear\n- Last month a 12 old girl i knew on the internet confessed to me and i rejected her because she is 12 and I was 22 but we continued to chat until one day we were talking about erotic roleplay, she really wanted to do sexting and really literally begged me until she convinced me so i thought i would roleplay as a boy around her age and while we were sexting pretending we were the same age i got horny and watched a normal porn video and jerked off to the porn video, i swear we didn't send any picture or anything else and after that i understood that was wrong i said i was sorry and she said it was fine and forgave me.\nI feel very sorry about all these things I'm really trying to improve as a person but i know i will probably feel guilty for the rest of my life",

I know karma will get me back someday. I am so sorry but I just instinctively drove away😭 and didn’t go into the store. \n\nCrazy enough I went to the same store in another location and I saw someone’s car that I knew there.

I visited Chicago a few years ago and fell in love and decided that it’s where I wanted to live. I convinced my boyfriend to come with me and we both left our jobs and moved. \n\nWe now live in an apartment that is almost twice as expensive, making just about the same amount of money, maybe a little more. We sold one of our cars because I was just going to take public transportation but now we only have one car and still have so much debt from moving that we can’t seem to make a dent in paying off. \n\nOn top of the money, the city sucks. It’s dirty, stinky, everyone’s racist (I am white and my boyfriend is Polynesian) and I have just never met a more entitled group of people in my life. No one is willing to help anyone else, it’s all for yourself. \n\nI’m just not happy here. I thought I was going to be a “city girl” and I just spend all my time at home and then I’d just rather be back in Alaska with my friends who actually cared about me. I don’t have any money to move back and I just feel trapped. \n\nI also regret asking my boyfriend to come because he has been so supportive but I know he is feeling the same way.",

        "text": "It's probably the meanest thing I've ever done. Sorry for using a throwaway account, and I'm also going to keep it vague but I hope it's easy to follow.\n\nI started participating in an online fandom/subculture with smaller communities inside of it. Some drama broke out in one of these smaller communities that leaked into the larger one. There was some illegal activity involved, but the drama mostly amounted to some teenagers/young adults pointing fingers at each other for being problematic. The larger community skews older. I publicly gave my two cents and one of the people directly involved in the initial drama ended up DMing me about it and inviting me to the Discord server of this same smaller community.\n\nI took their invitation and joined their server. I ended up being privy to some more specific details of the drama. A lot of these details made me uncomfortable but I thought it would be rude to just leave when the person that invited me confided in me. Over the next few days, this person also had a very big meltdown in the server because of the drama. I thought it was way overblown so I took screenshots of the meltdown and privately sent them to my friends.\n\nI had a lot of stress in my own life and when this happens I go to gossip websites for internet personalities. It's not because I actually dislike the people they bully or think they deserve it. I never post, I just like to watch and laugh. During covid lockdowns my habit of visiting once a week, escalated to refreshing the websites all day by the time this drama happened. I was honestly really excited when someone else started posting about the initial drama, because I was like an insider. For once, I had all the tea. If other users didn't ask about what happened, I might not have posted anything, but I desperately wanted to feel useful, and as it went on, I convinced myself that they were starting drama on purpose. So I posted what I knew. I left out the more private stuff, but I wrote about it in an extra snarky way, and I even threw in some name calling for good measure because I wanted them to think I was cool.\n\nThe server eventually saw the posts and I never told them it was me. They thought some of the posts were funny, but the next day I realized what I was doing was really fucked up. I vaguely apologized for involving myself and I cut contact with the server and everyone in it. The initial drama cleaned itself up just as it would have without my involvement. \n\nThis was a long time ago but I still regularly feel pangs of guilt. I wrote out a longer apology but if I came clean entirely it might hurt their feelings more so I never sent it. I don't know if it's right for me to still participate in the larger community like nothing happened. The most pathetic part is that I had already been an adult for a while so I had no reason to care about it all to begin with. From the very beginning I should have just ignored everything. When I explained the situation to others they didn't think it was a big deal, and I have all of the excuses and justifications but I know in my heart that I could have been better and I still want a way to make up for it. I almost hope they will see *this* post so I can just get it over with. \n\nAnyway, I guess I'm posting to hear the perspective of an outsider.",

So I did I went and showered, came out later and she to me that I didn’t wash my ass well enough because I still stank and so I got back in. I got back in and started washing but I wanted to make sure I got it right this time(I really didn’t like showering as kid.) so I started thinking what exactly does she mean when she says wash my ass. Then I got the bright idea to put the soap in my butt. I took a few tries but I got it in and then couldn’t get it out. It was burning and I was screaming. My mom came in(she thought I was hurt.) saw me digging at my butt and asked if I was alright. I told her that there was a bar of soap in my butt and I couldn’t get it out. She tried digging at it my dad tried digging at it but it was to slippery so we went to the ER. When we got home my mom asked why I would do something like that and I told her because you told me to. She realized by telling me to wash my ass she had told to wash my ass so i tried to wash my ass and she started crying my dad was laughing the night ended. They never told me to wash my ass again. They just told me to shower.",
