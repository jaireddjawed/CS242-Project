        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI hope this is relevant/allowed, just looking for advice. I recently accepted a summer internship as a developer, which I think is going to be great! My only qualm is that I also just secured a interview/chat with another company, which I got through reaching out to the CEO (small-ish startup), as well as through personal references of people I already know working there. This would be for a role I would be more interested in (AI/ML), but I have decided I won't go back on my acceptance of the original job. \n\nI would like to keep my options open with this company, as I would love to work there in the future. How should I approach this? I feel bad that I had them go through the effort of setting up a meeting, just to take another job before it happens. I would also love to just chat about what they do, but they're probably too busy for that.\n\nAny advice is welcome :)",

        "text": "Title. I am applying to jobs just posted on LinkedIn right now. Most of my network works at the tech companies having layoffs (these are people I just had informational interviews with). A lot of the jobs out there, I try to find people working there to talk to but I cant connect with them. I apply for the job anyway. \n\nI was getting responses with my resume when I applied to rotational programs and such. So my resume probably isn't shit. However, now that I'm applying to normal jobs, I'm not hearing anything except from one company. I have a variety of experiences, so I'm applying to a variety of different jobs.\n\nIs it worth it to just stick with applying to like one type of job (for example, customer success or product analyst roles) or should I remain a little open? [Here is my resume (black Word skin, I switch things out so it's just one page)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/270744930446475264/1083131720410345502/image.png) . In my mind I have the data analysis internship, but am in a UX program. I don't want to design, I want to eventually become a product manager but not immediately. I might start targeting product analyst roles. \n\nI have a variety of experiences, but I feel like only putting relevant experience will make my resume look short for any individual role. Any advice is appreciated. I left my family so I really need to find a job by next fall at the absolute latest.",

        "text": "Okay so, currently I am working in a WITCH company since July 2021 as a tester with a CTC of around 7.8 LPA, been in the same project since joining the project. It's my first company after graduating in 2021. I did my bachelors from a NIT in Civil Engineering with a decent CGPA. Ya, feels like a joke thinking that at the moment, but the placement scenario was screwed for us, the COVID batch, but I was always into coding since my college days to make up for it. \n\nHowever, right now, there are two things that are bugging me - firstly, this project is offering zero growth. Initially they offered opportunities to build some value adds and all (built 2-3 using Spring Boot), but how long does one keep on building stuff for a test team? Daily works surround automation plus manual tests and they suck big time. \n\nSecondly, I was always very much into maths since my school days and after I watched some theory videos of the maths behind some of the ML models, been really into the entire AI/ML thing and have done several of courses around deep learning, NLP, and whatnot. Tried applying to several places for data scientist roles but everywhere I apply, they are always looking for CS grads which I am not. I am aware of the fact that masters help greatly in enhancing careers like this, but again, I am from a middle class family with my earning parents about to retire and I don't have a CS background in bachelors\n\nI aso thought of going away from test role at first to some other big data based role (maybe around Kafka/Snowflake) and then try switching to data science but there is this thing - I think I am stuck in training hellhole. I always am fascinated in learning new stuffs but then, can't do anything after that. And at the end of the day, it's utterly frustating. Don't know how long I can continue like this, and the continuous thought of it while coping with the bullshit job is sending me to mental instability day by day. What shall I do now? Any suggestions would be much appreciated, and last but not the least, thanks for tolerating my rant if you've read till now! :)",

I came in last May and have been using my 6 year old Thinkpad with Linux for work. For the past 4 months my laptop has been crashing. Last month I asked my boss to fund a new machine, and he agreed to fund half the cost and encouraged me to get a Mac so I could be full stack. We finished getting a seed round 2 weeks ago, so my boss bought a Mac desktop so that all the non-Apple people could test the app, and so him and a mutual friend that shares the office could use it to DJ/make music. Last week I found out Apple's M1 M2 chips don't really support Linux so I told my boss I was going with latest gen of my Thinkpad. I ordered it and asked if he'd reimburse it in my next paycheck. He said he never agreed to that, and would never had agreed to that. I said that I wasn't trying to gaslight him, but didn't want him to gaslight me, and that we'd talk aHow can I convince my boss to expense a work machine and raise my salary with inflation?bout it when he was back from the morale event. I am returning the laptop, but don't want it to come off as retaliation or being held responsible for losing work if my laptop crashes again.\n\nI think I'm a bit salty because once it was clear we got seed funding, he decided there would be a morale ski trip. one of our interns and I couldn't go so he's there with the other intern and his girlfriend. He's covering the flights and lodging which is more expensive than the laptop. I mentioned this and he said he's okay with financing the trip because it would be about being together, but when I asked about where the idea came from it was from his girlfriend.\n\nAs an aside, he took a call with our lawyers to figure out accounting while sorting out seed funding and he mentioned his salary and it's less than mine not including equity. I make less than median for people with my experience and our location. He makes comments like \"you make more than enough to...\" I'm worried he's not gonna be okay with me negotiating my salary to rise with inflation. My last company was big and had a formal review process, so I would just be given an increase in base pay and bonus. I've been the mentor for our 2 interns, and I've worked weekends and late nights to meet deadlines for our features.",

        "text": "Hi,\n I wanted to share my experience at a recent internship because I'm honestly not doing well. I was an HR intern. Prior to this, I have have had nonexperience in the corporate world. I come from a humble background. Both my parents worked non-corporate jobs. I grew up in \"hood\" and it's hard to admit this but I feel I might dumb and here's why. My internship gave me a work laptop to work with projects. I transfer a work documents to my personal computer just cause the screen is bigger and it more comfortable to use. Unfortunately, I didn't know this was not allowed. I geuinenly didn't know that. I feel dumb cause I feel I should have known that. because no one in the HR team sat me down and told me the policies/rules. Aside from that, outlook has the option to have two emails together. I was sending out test emails(a draft that was going to be sent out to employees of the company) to my team with my personal email. It was a mistake cause the two accounts where connected when I did the mail merge. The Hr lady that even so those emails are \"their property\" and classified? And this internship was remote. And the manager was keeping track if I was online through Microsoft teams status. Basically if I was home I would need to let her know if I set out or if I had lunch. But most of the time I was at home and I didn't think that was the way I was being monitored. Amongst other things she told me I lacked soft skills. I was at this internship for less than a month. I admit to the mistakes that I made purely out of ignorance. I'm heartbroken because of this. I'm trying to keep my spirits up but it feels like I'm being penalized for a mistake I made that I wasnt aware of. And when I think like I feel dumb because it should have been common sense :(",

        "text": "I’m probably wording the title wrongly but I’m just gonna try to explain my current situation. I’m a Senior dev working on mostly front end. My team has gone through 4 front end developers in the past year and the common theme is that they just weren’t doing enough. But oddly enough, they all have had more years of experience than me when they start.\nIt’s taking a toll on me because obviously I have to assign work to them but the amount of teaching that I have to do is getting frustrating. There’s not one person who was ever able to do something all by themselves even after almost a year and there wasn’t any work that I didn’t have to either walk them through or eventually rework. All this is in addition to my own work. \nBy the way, our UI work is fairly straightforward, we just render ui based on api response, the ux design is already provided.\nI just got off a call this morning where I had to teach someone with 6 years of experience in angular how to do a git add and commit. He also doesn’t seem to understand flexbox. It was the same with the last two people, there were gaps in knowledge that were shocking given that they have more years of experience than me. We’ve had interns that were more talented. \nWould it be career suicide to suggest to our tech lead that the quality of hiring is becoming a problem or am I the problem? I’m honestly drowning trying to balance teaching new hires things they should know and doing my own work. I don’t even know what’s the way forward. The person who hires them is a tech lead of many teams so he’s not going to know about their day to day activities and I’m scared that I’ll sound like a complainer and non team-player.\nI’ve already tried jumping to some other team but it’s going to take time, I’m stuck here for most of year ahead.",

I was hired as a developer and overall everyone has been pleased with my work. Since we are such a small team, we sometimes 'wear' the 'hat' that we are assigned to. \r\n\r\nSince I previously worked in another sector (non-dev) I have been helping management with establishing potential sales leads and a sales pipeline. I dedicate about 10 to 20% of my time to those sales related tasks. Recently management brought in an designated sales person. What started as a collaboration on most of the processes that I have developed regarding sales, has slowly evolved to a situation where this person basically does nothing and only sweeps in at the last moment to make the landing. E.g. a few hours before our weekly general meeting, me and the sales person have a sales call. Afterwards at the general meeting, the new sales person just presents everyone the new leads that were established, copying the notes I handed him at our meeting. The same goes for actually landing clients.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I am kicking myself a bit. It is clearly that I have played my cards badly and not capitalised on the work I have put in. Eager to take on whichever work comes my way, I have slowly submitted myself to a subordinate relationship with this new sales person. I am dedicated to the growth of the company and team collaboration is important on that level, but then I prefer a more equal partnership colaboration, rather then this new sales person suddenly profiling himself as my manager, without any decision from management in that direction.\r\n\r\nI feel that my knowledge about corporate politics, and in general taking credibility for my work and guarding my own growth, lineair with the companies growth, is too little. therefor, I would like to learn more. I prefer books (or audiobooks) but all resources are welcome. Thx!",

I have no idea what they are going to check, who they are going to talk to, or even what information would cause them to rescind the offer. \n\nI have done a lot of background checks over the years and never had an issue. I have worked for multi-national banks and had a government clearance. So I don't think there should be an issue. But since it is completely opaque, I don't give notice until complete.\n\nMost background checks take just a few days. But I have had push back from companies that want me to start in 2 weeks and companies where the background checks took a long time. I always push back and they can either move the start date to give the time needed, or they can rescind the offer. So far they have always extended the date but I can tell some HR people get annoyed by my insistence.\n\nAnd yes, I know notice is not required but I try not to leave anywhere on bad terms, especially if I have otherwise had a good work experience there. I also don't want to leave my former boss and co-workers holding the bag with me not giving at least some notice.\n\nSo, I guess I am just wondering, am I extreme? It's weird to me they seem surprised when I stick to my guns on this. Am I the only one?\n\nJust wondering if this is a standard policy for most people or is this just a me thing?",

I was pretty lucky I think to get the gig, since I had no experience, but I chalk that up to general soft skills during the interview.\n\nThe job is good and I've learned a lot, but I think I'm going to have to move to another job if I want to make competitive pay. I've started cooking up a resume since I lost my old one, but I literally have nothing that would make sense to put in a 'projects' section. Since I work in the government, I can't really point to any actual examples of my code since all of the work I have done is for internal facing projects. Coding is not a hobby to me, and while I like doing it for work I have no desire to make stuff in my free time.\n\n Is it alright to not have that stuff on a resume, or would that negatively affect me enough in my prospects to warrant making stuff on the side just to show off for a resume?

Don't think I'd hate it but don't think I'd LOVE it.\n\nI am currently one year into a three year bachelor of Data Analytics degree. After further thought and looking into the Data Analytics job market, I thought it would be better to study a three year bachelor of Information Technology degree. I figured it would be easier to have a IT degree and go into data analytics if I really wanted to, rather than go into an non data job with a data analytics degree. If chose to swap degrees this, all my courses would carry over to the new IT degree and I would not lose any 'progress' thus the IT degree would only be two years.\n\nI believe I would like to go into the software side of things. Not sure exactly what in software (maybe programming and development), but working with hardware doesn't excite me. I know that if I am wanting to go down this path, a bachelor of computer science degree is probably more fitting. However, if I transferred into a CS degree, I would lose my completed Uni courses 'progress' and have to start from scratch.\n\nIf I went down the IT degree route, and decided I wanted to go into software, do you think it would be hard to find a job assuming I do a lot of self lead online study and online courses in the field (at this stage likely programming and development)?\n\nWhat would you recommend, go down the IT route and some online courses/self lead education my desired field (when I fully decide) or start from scratch and start the CS degree?\n\nThanks!",

Studying an hour here and there on different things also means I’m more slowly making progress on any one of the things.\n\nI’m curious as to what other current job seekers are doing. For context, I was laid off after 8 months of my first job out of college.",

I'm in my third-year of CS and I have proven to myself that I can tackle very difficult assignments with relative ease; I know that I am good at this. Of course I know that I have loads of stuff to learn, but I want to emphasize that I am more than ready for a Junior position writing code in C, Java, or Python.\n\nMy problems are two-fold: (1) no internships, and (2) not a people-person. I don't have any internships under my belt because I enrolled in CS out of interest and I didn't foresee myself trying to make a career out of it. But honestly, with the way the economy is right now, any good-paying job is necessary, and at this point I have the knowledge. I just don't have the on-hands experience.\n\nIn regards the second issue, I've had my fair share of teamwork. But it's not something I thrive in. I'm a creative person who is more interested in being alone with my mind than being with a team working on a product. I'm also just not generally well-spoken and communicative. I know that none of this translates well into an interview, much less a company culture. And I always hear employers say that they would rather higher candidate B, who is less skilled but more personable, over candidate A, who is more skilled but less personable.\n\nI really hate asking this, because I hate competition in general ... but what can I do to gain an advantage? I have many projects from school that I can improve and publish, and I am working on a website portfolio for this purpose. I also have very good knowledge of Python, as I have studied the core documentation intensively. And yet I apply to so many jobs outlining all of my assets, and barely ever get a response, if not to be rejected.\n\nIt shouldn't be this difficult, right? How are so many people picking up Junior positions? Is an internship basically required in this day and age? If it is, what's my best shot at getting around this?",
