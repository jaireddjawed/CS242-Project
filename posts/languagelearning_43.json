        "text": "Hey everyone! So I was wondering if this happens to anyone else, and if so, how do you respond in these situations.\n\nI am a native speaker of English but I am also proficient in Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. My Spanish is still probably a notch or two down from my Portuguese and Italian though (Probably somewhere between B2-C1) since I've never really lived in a Spanish-speaking country, but I've been around it and have spoken it most of my life.  \n\nI live in the States and about half of my friendships with Spanish-speakers take place mostly in English (the other half entirely in Spanish), but they know I also speak Spanish. Sometimes when I am with them in a Spanish-speaking environment, they will unnecessarily translate things for me and it makes me extremely... irritated. Like for example, I was talking with my friend's mom once in Spanish and my friend randomly butts in and says \"luna de miel means honeymoon,\" which I have known like... since I was 10. Or recently I was visiting a different friend in El Salvador and when I was buying coffee from a store, he asked the store owner about the prices and differences between the coffee, and then translated the response into English as if I did not understand what was going on, and I responded something like \"Amigo, ellos están hablando en español, no en chino\" hoping he'd get the hint. \n\nI understand that this is probably not a big issue for most people, but I just find it extremely patronizing and sometimes I don't know exactly how to respond in situations like this - especially since I know I'm an advanced speaker of Spanish. If this happened in a language I was actively learning, I wouldn't care at all. I'm assuming a lot of native Spanish speakers probably deal with similar situations here in the U.S. Like I'm okay if a friend says \"Did you get all of that?\" if someone goes into a long technical discourse but when people unnecessarily translate simple things assuming I don't know it really bothers me. \n\nHas this ever happened to you? And how do you handle it?  or does it even bother you?",

And the answer I got from them was \"I hope if I were NOT an English native so I could have an opportunity to learn second language\"...\n\nHearing that, I realised that he really doesn't understand  MERIT of having English as one's first language, how it is hard to learn foreign language, not as hobby but as tool of lifeliving, and How high the opportunity cost of learning English is - We can save Even years of time and do other productive things if we don't have to spend our time to learn english.\n\nIs anyone disagree with my point of view here?",

Anyway I am currently doing a study that requires me to choose a world area and a corresponding language to learn. I am sure I want to do South and Southeast Asia (yes it is one region in this study), but I have the choice between two languages, Hindi and Indonesian.\n\nI really do not know which language I should learn, on one hand, I find it very interesting to learn a new alphabet, on the other hand, Indonesian is an Austronesian language which also makes things very interesting, since all languages I currently speak are Indo-European.\nI am Dutch so learning Indonesian could be an interesting journey because of the similarities and shared history we have, also seen the number of Indonesian people living in the Netherlands is relatively large (only I think most do not speak Indonesian)\nHowever when I visited Mauritius this year I was intrigued by the fact that many people speak Hindi and the aspect of Indian culture(s) that is visible in Mauritius.\n\nFor both languages I heard that in business related settings they are not very useful, Indonesians don't speak formal Indonesian while Hindi is not used in formal settings because people often know English. Also a lot of academical work from India is written in English.\n\nMy question is: does anyone have experience learning one of these languages (in an academical setting)? And what do you think is a better choice for a university student?",

I want to challenge myself to see if I can learn a language as quickly as possible and I’ve seen a lot of strategies in order to do so. One user on this subreddit said they went from little to no experience of French to being able to skip a level in 2 months. In the same post they give many different methods they used to learn it in that short of a time span. However, I didn’t see any resources they added that we’re free to use and that’s where I’m stuck. I’m curious as to what websites or other resources I should use to get a basic knowledge of the language whether that’s gaining and understanding of conjugating sentences, pronunciation, and other parts. I’m not sure if it matters to what resources you can provide but the languages I’m interested in learning at the moment are Spanish and French. Thank you for your time.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/zyp9nw/comprehensible_inputci_review_600_hours_in_review/",
        "text": "**Intro:**\n\nHello everyone I'm sorry I'm late with my post. My last post was 8 months ago and I recently had a lot going on like a newborn the past 7 months, and opening up a private practice.  I took a month off in June because of the baby then I was burnt out October to Early December.\n\nIf you have not saw my [100 hour post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/svvg7z/comprehensible_input_review_100_hours_in_review/), [150 hour post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/td63qc/comprehensible_input_review_150_hours_in_review/) and [300 hour post](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/uoayai/comprehensible_input_review_300_hours_in_review/) please go back to get the full picture. I am posting at every [milestone of Dreaming Spanish.](https://imgur.com/a/cWpQj8x)  \n\n**Breakdown:**\n\nI do CI 2 hours daily now. I want to say 3 hours is definitely doable as I was doing in the past if your life is not very busy. However 3 hours daily for me became too much for me. I started to really zone out when listening or going on my phone at times. I knew I needed to stop because nothing was sinking in and I was getting pissed off about my life and just miserable. The 2 months off helped me out a lot. I was thinking of not even getting back into it but there really isn't any posts out here like this that fully goes through with CI  from start to finish and I really want to learn Spanish. When I did start getting back into I felt that I was more at ease with the method. I figured out I was examining each word or sentence and trying to translate it prior to the break and that would hinder my progress so much. When I got back into it I didnt beat myself up so much and would just continue with following the conversation. This has helped me out so much because I'm not translating as much and the Spanish is just coming to me easier and natural. I think this method is fantastic for people that dont do well with studying. Can I speak at all? Absolutely not but that's because Im not practicing and with the Dreaming Spanish method I'm not supposed to until the 800 hour mark. \n\nWith the 600 hour mark this is what Dreaming Spanish says I should be able to do. The things I'm crossing out are thing I feel I cannot personally do consistently. \n\n&gt;**What you can do:**  \nY~~ou can understand people well when they speak directly to you.~~ ~~They won’t need to adapt their speech for you.~~ Understanding a conversation between native speakers is still hard. You’ll almost understand TV programs in the language, because you understand so many of the words, but they are still hard enough to leave you frustrated or bored. Conversation can be tiresome, and if you try to speak you can feel a bit like a child, since it will be hard to express abstract concepts and complex thoughts. You understand most of the words used during daily conversation, but you still can’t use many yourself. If you try to speak the language, it will feel like you are missing many important words. However, you can, often, already speak with the correct intonation patterns of the language, without knowing why, and even make a distinction between similar sounds in the language when you say them out loud.\n\nThe two sentences I cross off is somewhat true and will go into more details with the section \"Tutor CI:\" I also dont have a lot of native speakers directly talking to me so discretion advised. \n\n**Podcast:**\n\nIve been doing 30 minutes when I wake up of a podcast of either [Españolistos (Youtube link) on Spotify](https://www.youtube.com/@espanolistos4917/videos) or [Learn Spanish and Go (Youtube link) on Spotify.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmgQlFl3Z-Y&amp;ab_channel=SpanishandGo) These podcasts have become a good amount easier too me. Still challenging but nowhere near as difficult as me being at the 300 hour or even the 500 hour mark.  For the 30 minutes to work and 30 minutes back from work a more challenging podcast called [Spanish Language Coach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g6wTgYtTrQ&amp;list=PLZ0gIy8s4ZTWezasfznZzYd4eB2zVphVM&amp;ab_channel=IntermediateSpanishPodcast) that I had no idea wtf he was saying 100-200 hours ago. I'm getting more comfortable but still have a lot of work. I'm also doing telemundo daily news which is hard as shit but I need some more challenging audio.\n\n**Youtube:** \n\nAt work I watch [RichardBetaCode a Youtube Gamer from Spain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfLvow65lM&amp;list=PLOKn42uoWYuzeczEtE5RdyJYpAL7ydcnA&amp;ab_channel=RicharBetaCode). He has great content for Spanish learners if you like video games. Ive watched a long play of Resident Evil, Resident Evil 5,Days Gone and currently on the new God of War. When I watch videos Im using Language Reactor. More details about Language Reactor below. I would say his channel is more advanced but great learning material with subtitles.\n\n**Language Reactor:**\n\n[Language Reactor is $4.95 monthly and would say it is worth it.](https://www.languagereactor.com/)  Spanish audio with Spanish subtitles only. 30 minutes daily are spent on this daily at work. It helps out a lot with learning new words but also helps out so much with reading. My reading has improved so much. Without subtitles on native videos they can be very hard if not impossible to understand. If I have subtitles on my god it is so much easier. \n\n300 hours in word count for words I know well is: 2,448 words.  However Language reactor updated and fucked up a lot of how it makes you highlight words for learning. It says I'm at 2000 somehow. The recent update screwed up trying to click new words and color coordinating them for the past month. Still a good learning tool but they need to fix their shit.\n\n**Tutor CI:**\n\nSo I specifically found a CI tutor on one of the popular tutor sites at about 500 hours. I had no idea how to fucking talk.. However when speaking directly to me it felt totally different from just listening to podcasts. I was actually so much more focused and was able to understand about 90% of what he was telling me. He told me he was speaking at about B1-B2 level. However was disappointed with my speaking skills and told me to come back at 600 hours. Im not going to right now because my speaking still sucks balls. Dreaming Spanish they want you speaking to others at 800 hours. Im going to wait until then. \n\n**Grammar:** \n\nMy grammar suck I still struggle with past conjugations and understanding the slight differences of present vs past tense conjugations. Word order can still be very challenging to me. Will I eventually pick up a book and start trying to improve this? Most likely no. Im going to continue with CI I feel like I will get it eventually. Irregular conjugations are a bitch too. Im probably going to try to complete the fantastic grammar videos of [Complete Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OZbL91GXGI&amp;list=PLeA5t3dWTWvvwf5fw0Nl7mVk0OUjP1Ln2&amp;ab_channel=LanguageTransfer).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI'm going to continue with this method for a long time. I have an estimated 200 days for hitting the next goal of 1000 hours and 450 days to hit the 1500 mark which is the \"You are comparable to a native speaker.\" Will I be comparable to a native speaker by 1500 hours? I think that depends on when I start learning how to speak. I feel at 1500 hours I will be advanced at understanding/listening and reading. I recommend this method to anyone that does not want to do the traditional way of learning or have difficulty with that method. I really dont think Im a person at the beginning that thought they can learn a language and while Im not there yet Im making better progress than I thought I was.\n\nI will see everyone back at 1000 hours! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTagging people that have been asking for the updated post over the past 3 months..\n\n/u/hailtothepose09 ,  /u/throwthrow9090903 ,  /u/SpiritedMarionberry7 /u/zedeloc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso shout out to /u/langdreamer for his fantastic site that is [Dreamingspanish.com](https://Dreamingspanish.com) .

Do you suggest another app to help supplement language learning then this pair? \n\nRight now I am planning for how to take my language learning to the next level. Right now, I am trying to study 3 languages ( 1 I have high proficiency in already from years of study, just refreshing it, but I practice 2 others seriously and 1 other occasionally ) \n\nThose languages are Spanish, Japanese, Hindi, and Swahili. I use Tandem Chat to practice my Spanish and Japanese more often, but I'm looking to replace that with something else since no one on the app speaking hindi wants to practice english with me. \n\nSo Do y'all have a suggestion for another app or tool I can use in the new year to improve my language learning? Ideally, a tool to supplement all of these, but just supplementing 2 or 3 of these languages would be more than enough!  \n\nSide note - If my language goals matter ... \n- Spanish - I aspire to go to spain in 2025  \n- Japanese - I watch a lot of anime every week so I wanted to learn it. I also may be going in 2024 for work \n- Hindi - I go to Bollywood film festivals often and just want to learn what they are saying. I don't aspire to use it in a travel capacity at the moment and they speak english in india anyways. \n- Swahili - Family mostly &amp; I want to be able to travel on my own in Kenya and Tanzania. They both speak english officially, but I want to be prepared\n\nI **don't aspire for fluency** but I would like to know what other kinda tools could help me with my goals. Thanks in advance!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/zy4cuc/reevaluation_of_learning_goals_and_strategies/",
        "text": "**Goals**\n\nSome of you may notice that I changed my flair after re-evaluating my current language levels today, and that my French level went down from C2 to B2+. And I have to admit, it stings, and I did have to swallow my pride to make that change and lower it, but I want to be honest about my abilities here (and I always give my weakest skill level as the base).\n\nSo what happened? Why the sharp drop?\n\nWhen I raised it to C2, I had just watched a DALF C2 speaking exam video and realised that yeah, that's definitely within my speaking ability (speaking generally being one of my weak points, it had been my lowest and \"holding me back\" at the time). I had also done one of the former DALF C2 exams for listening and reading, and written the essay for the writing part and get it checked by a French teacher. In short, at that time, I was confident I could pass the DALF C2, so it felt fair to raise my flair to that level. I still felt like it was a shaky C2 for the active skills, but then C2 is from threshold to open end  so it's normal that even when passing the threshold, there's still a ton of room for improvement.\n\nSince then, some things happened with my health that have a considerable impact on my language goals. \n\nFor one, my voice has become unreliable. I think after three months of strained voice, hoarseness, and vocal chord problems, it's safe to assume it may never get back to normal (especially since the cause is something I can't change). Which means I can't really talk much at all anymore, and mostly communicate by typing now, even with my family at home. To reflect that in my goals, I've decided to replace the Speaking skill with a Chatting skill for me (basically splitting writing into \"spoken register\", most notably chatting without looking anything up, and \"written register\", which includes carefully crafting essays, short stories, letters, and so on with and without the ability to look stuff up).\n\nThe other big impact is from my brain fog (from chronic illness) that is impacting my cognitive abilities (ability to remember words I know when I need them, attention span and connected \"slip-up\"-type mistakes despite knowing better, that sort of thing). While the resulting problems also affect my native language, I can't completely ignore them when evaluating my active skills in my TLs. Which means, they're not as good as they used to be because my accuracy and precision have gotten worse.\n\nWith this background, I made the (for me) difficult decision to also adjust my overall goals (yes, another thing that hurt my pride). I just don't feel like a solid C2 in all four skills, which requires a high degree of grammatical accuracy and language precision, is realistic right now. It is still absolutely realistic (and still my goal) for both passive skills in my four \"main TLs\" (French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian), but I'll aim for C1 in writing and B2 in chatting now. As for the other languages, I wanted to bring them all to a solid B2, which I've also adjusted to C1 in reading, B2 in listening and writing, and B1 in chatting. I think those goals are currently more realistic for me.\n\n**Strategies**\n\nI had a lot of success with study-time challenges (basically challenging myself to study for X amount of hours per week or month), and also with a reward system based on which TL tasks I did each week. Lately, I noticed that instead of motivating me, it actually kept me from studying. It had started to feel like a barrier to just \"doing something\". I revamped my whole goal and reward system just a few weeks ago, but what I was changing it to didn't work either.\n\nI've also noticed that, even though I know how helpful it is for me in the beginning stages, I just don't like sitting down and doing textbook stuff (whether in book form or in app form doesn't matter). Vocabulary I don't mind that much, but textbook stuff...I actively have to force myself to do it. And because forcing myself to sit down and study doesn't work well for me right now, I need to change my approach.\n\nNow this is no problem for my \"main TLs\", which are all at a level where I can just continue consuming native-level content to improve, but it is a serious problem for the other five languages, neither of which is at that level yet. In fact, I'm only scraping at B1 reading comprehension in two of them, and am still a bloody beginner in the other three (let's not even begin talking about my active skills XD they always lag behind). I've definitely neglected them this year while I kept clinging to my previous approach hoping everything would just \"get back to normal after a while\".\n\nSo my goal going into the new year is to put at least some of my beginner languages on the backburner and focus on one or two at a time (while I keep using my main TLs, of course) to hopefully get them out of that awful beginner stage so that I can start using them for all the fun stuff like my stronger languages. I just don't currently have the energy or headspace for 25+ hours of language studying per week.\n\nTL;DR: Life happens and it's no shame to adjust your goals and strategies (even if it hurts your pride). Re-evaluate your language studying regularly and make changes as needed. Also, language learning isn't always a linear improvement, and set-backs can happen for any reason, and to all of us.",

There were some hot Hungarian girls who looked kinda gay walking beside me, talking quite loudly (I'm a lesbian for context). They are speaking Hungarian but I couldn't tell you whether it was actual Hungarian or just gibberish, but they did make sound.\n\nIt starts stressing me out because of the noise, and then some Asian looking children start making loads of noise because they are just about to go to school (but they are wearing striped pyjamas for some reason and going into a house as their school).\n\nAnyway, this causes me even more stress so I start running. The Hungarian girls, who are apparently with me now, ask me why I'm running and catch up to me. I reply in German but right after I replied my alarm woke me up, so I don't remember the whole of what I said. It was to do with the noise and the people though, and I think it was a very short response. Still cool though!\n\nWhen was the first time you dreamt in your TL? :D",

I noticed there are a lot of things I know in the context of learning materials, but I can’t pull it up quickly outside of those contexts, and I struggle to remember vocabulary. I thought keeping a simple journal every day or two would be a great way to start solidifying what I learn. \n\nHowever, I’m not really sure what to write. I journal in English (native language) often, so I find myself frustrated I can’t express myself well in Korean. \n\nAre there any good prompt lists specifically for beginner learners? (I’m not a very beginner, but there’s *so* much I just don’t know). I generally see it advised to avoid dictionaries and focus on memory for journaling—should I give myself a set number of words to look up maybe, just to keep it fresh?\n\n“I drank tasty tea. I texted my younger brother. I went to work” is starting to frustrate me, but if this is the most helpful way to go about it I’ll keep doing it. I’m just not sure I’m doing it right. 😅",

I want to expand on all of these languages and found that learning all of them at once actually works for me. I want to add another language so that I can get more done. I'm considering Romance languages because they're so useful in English. I also would love to learn Arabic because I'd like to read the Quaran and think it's just a cool language in general. I also think something like sign language or a code of some sort could switch it up and make it fun. Since I also value preserving languages, I would like to learn Hawaiian or languages from Native American culture. I learned some Latin and some Greek for English roots and stuff.\n\nThere are too many for me to decide on, so I figured I'd let other people give me suggestions to narrow it down.",

        "text": "I’ve seen a lot of people suggest using a VPN with Netflix to watch movies and TV shows in your target language, but in my experience (with Spanish and Italian), it really makes no difference. Even living in the US with tons of Spanish speakers and Spanish-speaking countries neighboring US, the selection really isn’t great.\n\nI’m starting to realize that for some (and probably many) languages, there are dedicated streaming services *just for your target language*. \n\nFor example, instead of finding Italian language content on Netflix, I just use RaiPlay (which is free) in conjunction with ProtonVPN, and I can watch live tv or movies/shows on demand. Instead of finding Spanish language content on Netflix, I just use Pantaya ($6/month) and I don’t even need a VPN because it already serves the US.\n\nTo top it all off, the subtitles are usually way better than the sort of material I find on Netflix because it’s (almost) always native content, so there are no problems with translations not matching subtitles.\n\nIf you know of a streaming service that tailors to your target language, add it in the comments so we can hopefully build a bank of resources.",
