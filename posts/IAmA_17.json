        "text": "Sharing here because [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/) has a 500+ karma rule for posts - hopefully not off-topic.\n\nThose who were impacted by this FTX shitshow - share your experience...and let's figure out what we can do next.\n\nWhat got you on the exchange in the first place? Are you a... degen? a regular person? Why did you decide not to withdraw, or if you did, when did you withdraw and what is the current status of these funds? How do you feel about FTX, SBF, etc. etc. What have you learned? DO YOU THINK WE'LL EVER GET OUR MONEY BACK?\n\n**I'll start. Please be nice 🥺**\n\n*tl;dr - moved $10K USD.C from blockfi to FTX US after terra collapse. forgot it was in FTX and not coinbase. withdrew last Thurs but still no $$. now I want to hear your story.*\n\nI work in tech so I follow the general news cycles about tech / crypto but have never really traded crypto outside of buying and holding. Everyone started talking about web3 / defi in summer of 2021 so I decided to learn more about it. I'm not a degen and relatively risk averse so I opened a Blockfi interest account and put in $10K USD.C - in my mind the higher risk / return version of a HYSA, and made me feel 😎 that I had assets that are so new that I barely understand. A few months later, following the terra collapse (and FTX bailout), I decided to move the USD.C from blockfi to coinbase for safekeeping. I guess I decided to check out FTX to see what i's about and realized they had cheaper fees / what seemed like easier trading. I then transferred the $$ to FTX and **forgot this decision**...fast forward 5 months...I was casually following the FTX meltdown when I read a tweet about Blockfi pausing withdrawals late in the evening of Thurs Nov 10 and decided to check my coinbase account to pat myself on the back for my prescient decision of pulling out of Blockfi. I realized the $$ is not there, panic, and search everywhere before realize I had a FTX US account. I withdrew immediately via ACH and was happy when I got an email saying \"your withdrawal is processed\". Next morning I woke up and FTX filed for bankruptcy including FTX US. TBH I was fairly optimistic that it'll be okay because...idk I'm used to banking with good ol' US banks and thought of FTX US like a centralized and regulated entity...like a bank. Now...I am honestly not sure but would like to fight for my $$ back.\n\nAt first I was reluctant to share this story because I wasn't sure if it'd be taken seriously, but I realized that most of the media reports on the whole situation has been focused on SBF, the failings in the business, the investors, the bahamas penthouse, etc...without much mention of the customers who are impacted and what their stories are. It also makes me feel helpless that I don't know what I can do to improve the situation other than to wait. Maybe I think it's important to hear from people who were personally impacted by SBF &amp; team's gross mismanagement of FTX or maybe I just wanted to rant, but I'd love to hear other people's thoughts too.\n\nAnyway, if you've read this far, thank you. If you've been impacted by this shitstorm in any way, I'm really sorry...I'll share any updates / resources that I come across and I've not given up hope that all is lost.",

Currently, we're in the process of analyzing popular tattoo ink brands - the resultant information will be collated and added to the website \"What's in My Ink\". As of now, we've confirmed the presence of ingredients that aren’t listed on some labels. For example, 23 out of 56 different inks analyzed to date suggest the presence of an azo-containing dye. Although many azo pigments do not cause health concerns when they are chemically intact, bacteria or ultraviolet light can degrade these into another nitrogen-based compound that is a potential carcinogen.\n\nIn August 2022, my work was featured in Interesting Engineering, and the publication helped organize this AMA session. Ask me anything about what goes into tattoo inks and how one can make informed decisions before getting a tattoo, and understand the accuracy of the provided information.\n\nPROOF: https://i.redd.it/98l5vxo4mj0a1.jpg",

Here's a little bit more about myself, I studied film and graduated in 2010. Back then there wasn't a lot of opportunities for a young filmmaker from Leeds, so after a year of doing various odd-jobs, I sat and wrote a feature film and a few months later a bunch of friends and actors I'd worked with filmed it over two weeks in June 2011. It took me almost a year to edit and eventually I released it to YouTube, to my surprise it gain millions of views, the film is called The Truth About Romance: [LINK](https://youtu.be/H8w4XZLFSm0)\n\nThat film and all its views, opened up the door to many people. And from then I've worked for many media companies and Creative Agencies. Companies such as LADbible, where I got to work with Will Ferrell, Stormzy, Kevin Hart, Ice Cube etc. The City Talking where I helped them make documentaries for Amazon Prime. In Creative Agencies I've worked with brands like Adidas, The North Face, Cloud Nine, Reebok, various food and drink companies. \n\nBut it was the documentaries that I really loved, so I set up Creative Stories with my wife. It's a new venture and one I'm truly excited by. We tell honest stories about creative people. We've got lots of good interviewed lined up for the new year.\n\nAnyway, hope that's enough. Happy to answer any questions.",

Two years later, Leo was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder—a crime he has always denied.\n\nFifteen years into his sentence, Leo learned that previously unidentified fingerprints from Michelle's car have pointed to a new suspect: Jeremy Scott. At the time of the crime, Jeremy was a homeless teenager, with an extensive history of violence. Now, Jeremy is serving his own life sentence for a different murder—and he's recently given a detailed confession to the murder of Michelle Schofield. Yet Leo Schofield remains behind bars.\n \nKelsey and I have worked tirelessly on this case for years. Our findings are featured in the Bone Valley podcast, where we interview both Leo and Jeremy, and where we inadvertently solve a second, decades-old cold murder case. \n\nAsk us anything. \n\nProof: [Here's my proof](https://imgur.com/a/do9NK0Z)!",
