        "text": "In 2020, before I got into tech  I was in neuroscience trying to get into a very prestigious program. While trying to get references one of my advisors told me not to waste his time as I'd never get in with my transcript, I had to fight with him and advocate that I was worth writing one freaking letter for after 4 years as a research assistant. I did get into the program thanks to my data science skills but couldn't attend due to covid restrictions. This was early 2020 and I did manage to get another job in data that I enjoyed and was promoted at, but because of home issues and a full time caregiver, at the time my performance took a tank and I wasn't offered a full time after my part time coop was done (2021). After this I also just left school- I had done all my coursework for my degree but never filed for graduation. It's a psychology degree which isn't even related to my current work.\n\nDuring this time, I was dealing with depression and severely underperforming which led me to later getting fired at two jobs, the first was way worse as it was sudden and the boss went through all my flaws and told me from the start I didn't belong at the company and I was different. It took me awhile to get over it because they made me feel like trash, but I was able to get over it knowing that I was geniunely going through something at the time and they were far from perfect (I was a dev there making under minimum wage, so fuck 'em). \n\nThe second time was a much more up and down journey but I knew the owners of the firm so they gave me a lot of leeway. They were incredibly nice but I did have self esteem issues from some of their criticisms during some of our 1:1s (again, around my performance as a developer) but I could still tell they wanted the best for me. The fit wasn't the best in terms of work and I was silo'd and not talking to anyone (I am a huge extrovert). In the end they laid me off out of mercy so that I could still be guaranteed unemployment. I look back on that time very humbled and still thankful. During these two times I was dealing with various housing crises and more health issues from my dad, who had two strokes and became homeless. It was a tough time so but for the most part I bounced back each time. This was in the span from 2021-2022. \n\nAfter this I went hard into applications and because of an eviction (nothing really I could do about that one, my shithead cousin landlord gave me the choice of eviction or pay double rent) I had to take the first job I got an offer from. I was pivoting from data science to data engineering (which doesn't mean a lot to people, but it is a different skillset), so I was just happy to have a gig in the field. Little did I know giant tech layoffs would happen soon after, and felt very safe in my merch company. I felt very thankful to be there but knew again it would be a startup hustle culture, but I was prepared and did give everything up for it. I didn't date, I didn't have hobbies not related to tech, I didn't entertain anything else other than work. I poured my all into it because I was so scared of losing my job and housing again. I ended up becoming codependent on my manager for positive validation. It was an indicator of survival to me.\n\nIt paid off, I was for the first time in almost a decade (due to even more mental health issues previous to pandemic) I had enough income to enjoy life. I was incredibly social with my coworkers, I enjoyed the work and bought into the company mission, etc. We were the types to regularly go out for food together after work, joke with each other, etc. I was the first person on this team and doing the work of 2 jobs, and was interviewing for other roles in this team like crazy. I had some underperforming bouts but I also overproduced other weeks, so it seemed to all even out. I regularly did overtime and felt more energized at this role, and was producing stuff.  \n\nAnd then, well, after dozens of hours interviewing for someone to join the team I was a lone wolf on, we had one of our offer letters signed. Happy times, right? \n\nThat same afternoon HR joined my 1:1 with my manager. It was the coldest, most abrupt, truly traumatizing professional experience I'd ever experienced. I was shocked that within 5 minutes, I was locked out of EVERYTHING and everyone was treating me like a pile of dog shit on the floor they didn't want to step on. Cited for underperformance, and just at the end of my probationary period nonetheless. This was Friday.\n\nI feel myself not being able to cope with it. Initially I was ready to take a new job hunt on (I had done this a few times already!) but now as the hours pass by and my emotions seep through, all I can think about is one thing: why the fuck can't I hold down a job? If my life is going to be this perpetual roller coaster of having shit hit the fan everytime I finish rolling that boulder up the hill, why even bother living?\n\nMy mind is also racing around other social questions surrounding the event. I can understand an org restructure, me being too pricey, culture fit, budget cut, etc- but it also seems like everyone knew under their breath and I have no right to reach out for closure. It is almost obsessive for me to think about. Was I not worth even a little bit of nicety? I thought we were at least somewhat friends? \n\nI don't even want to think about returning to tech. I love it with all my heart and go to a lot of meetups/workshops, journal clubs, hackathons, contribute to open source/personal projects, etc that indicate it. Hell, I've been using Ubuntu as my main OS since 2016. But honestly I just don't think I'm good enough to keep up with the stamina of at least start ups, and I doubt I will enjoy or land an enterprise role anytime soon. I just truly wasn't good enough here, much like I wasn't good enough in my last career. I want to move somewhere new where people don't know me for being a tech person, change my friend groups which are all software engineers, and just leave it all behind. Like I honestly, genuinely, just suck. The fight that I had way back when for that single reference letter I no longer have. \n\nI feel like someone with the experience of a mid level at this point but still hasn't gone through the trials of a junior which has put me in a weird position. I felt it was a huge mistake building my career in startups where the ownership is high but the onboarding/mentorship is low, but it's too late to change that now.",

        "text": "TLDR: should I lock myself into a software engineering degree or choose a degree that covers more aspects of tech jobs\n\n\n\nI'm going to try and make this post not sound like the other broken record posts that I see here, I feel my view point is different than those. I'm currently attending WGU for a bachelor's degree in software engineering. I'm 29 and needed a career change and have always been interested in computers and dabbled with a lot of hardware and recently some software. The reddit doomers have been saying that SWE is dead and the job market is fucked and will remain to be fucked. I don't think that is true because although I may not know a lot about SWE I do know job market statistics and understand the impact tech has on the future. I believe it will bounce back and the jobs will be there. \n\nWhat I have thought about though is maybe I am locking myself in a box as far as my degree goes. My thought is to change my major to a different degree that encompasses more than just SWE, something like:\n\nB.S. Information technology\nB.S. Networking &amp; Security\nB.S. Cloud computing\nB.S. Cyber Security\n\nYes, my program is great but I feel like every one of those other programs has more certs, a wider overview of tech as a whole, and the same timeline of completion. For example do I learn only about SWE or do I broaden my area of studies so I can have diverse career options in things besides SWE. I am early enough in the program that everything I have completed so far will transfer to a different degree. Maybe I end up liking network security better? All of those programs have scripting and programming courses but the SWE program is more robust. I feel like this may be a much safer option for me. Any feedback would be appreciated.",

Also, there is a significant chance that I have epilepsy, so being able to drive in the future is shaky at best. Lastly, UConn is quite expensive, and I'm not sure how I can reasonably pay for the next three years of my education. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all of this in mind, I suppose my main questions are:\n\n* What is the difference in the quality of a Computer Science degree from one of the CUNYs versus UConn?\n* Is this a feasible thing to try to achieve as a young trans woman with only her friends for help?\n* How does obtaining financial aid in the CUNY system work? Do I have to live in NYC for a year before getting the residential rate?\n* Are there any other schools I should consider throwing a transfer application to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help or advice, and apologies for the long-winded post.",

'A' had apparently assumed that my task/ticket was about something else, even though any person listening to our group conversations would realize they were doing my work (plus it was clearly not a part of their ticket at least). I was adding more features than what 'A' did, but it seems the service won't have use for those extra stuff. So now my 3-4 days of work basically went to waste. I was already very upset on Thursday to see that happen but I thought M would stand up for me and say something like \"let's add the changes from your ticket in a new PR once we finish reviewing this current PR\". But instead he also pretty much stole any chance for me to add anything (the extra stuff) by pushing a new commit today and saying that there's request for pushing this service out quicker. Note, I find 'M' sometimes working on weekends and I'm just like, \"am I supposed to work, too? If yes, why don't people just mention that beforehand instead of sending random texts during the weekend?\"\n\nIt has happened in the past as well that whatever I worked on - guessing, trying my best to understand their codebase as a new hire thrown into poor documentation - got overlooked and ultimately someone came up with the same idea as I had voiced but somehow they believe they are teaching me something new. \n\nI'm so tired of this. I take care to ensure my language is always clear and in fact took initiative myself to schedule a feedback session with my manager (it seemed to catch him off guard but he then said he was happy to talk) to understand what they expect from me. I ask for deadlines but no one gives me any. Generally everyone is too comfortable in their jobs (we're talking people past their 40s). Everyone has been here in this suburb 10+ years and I'm just a new grad, moving from a big college to this suburb and just living here for the job. So when frustrating things like this happen, I just want to quit because I have nothing else here I'm affiliated to. I believe I'm quite smart and hard working. I believe I should and can find a new job.  \n\n\nWhat do you think?",

Recently I got contacted by someone from one of these interview prep courses, that promise to help you ace coding assignments, review and polish your resume / LinkedIn, put you in touch with \"their people\", guide you through the interview process and then help negotiate salary. Sounds great right?\n\nI attended a live session and came away thinking that, while the tuition is high, if they can deliver on their promise, or at the very least actually give you the contacts and resources they advertise then it might be worth it. However, I can also see many ways how it could be a money grab operation. For one thing, the lack of concreteness during the live session, makes me skeptical about their offering.\n\nHas anybody every gone through one of those to find a job and if so what was your experience?",

        "text": "I noticed a lot of new grads and students looking for jobs and internships have fairly weak projects. These projects are usually\n- School projects \n- Not hosted anywhere (no users, undemoable)\n- Using non-industry standard coding practices and frameworks (to be fair, college courses are never going to teach modern tech stacks)\n\nOf course, you dont need projects to land an internship or job (and lots of interns + juniors who work at big tech companies have no personal projects at all), but it will definitely help you\n1. During the interview process \n  - For system design, you can dive deep into all layers of your work and confidently explain high level concepts with examples\n  - For behavioral, you will have an edge compared to other applicants when discussing learning, overcoming difficulty, leading project development, simplifying workflows for customers, ...\n  - For leetcode, you will be able to write cleaner functions that are easier to understand, test and evaluate scalability and edge cases\n2. Not feel dumbfounded when onboarding and learning a new tech stack \n3. Understand what parts of web dev you like more (frontend, backend, devops, ...)\n\nFocus on 1 idea at the start\n- Dont overcomplicate your project with a ton of cool features you want to support, this is the easiest way to quit working on it after a week or so\n- It doesn't have to be revolutionary - all of the popular apps and services we use daily are pretty straightforward, e.g. reddit is just a forum, youtube is just a storage for videos, ...\n- For inspiration, check out some of the pretrained ML models on [tensorflow](https://tfhub.dev/) and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/hub/research-models) (no ML knowledge needed to use these)\n\nBuild a simple service around your idea \n- E.g. lets say your making an English to Spanish voice translator \n- Make it easy to test and use (think about your inputs and outputs)\n- Then wrap that logic behind a RESTful api interface - congratulations, you have built your first microservice!\n\nNext you want to build a frontend and backend \n- You can use any tech stack you want, but keep their codebases separate to avoid coupling \n  - React frontend, Express / Spring boot / Django backend is a great start \n- For the translation example above, we want the client to record or upload audio to a cloud managed object store, tell our backend to process it, then have our backend delegate that request to the processing microservice \n  - Create the concept of a \"user\" and track their info, media files and processing tasks in a SQL database \n\nThat's pretty much it! When it comes to personal projects, hiring managers care more about depth than breadth. Here are some starting points and topics for building on top of this\n- Unit / integration / e2e testing \n- Typescript \n- SSR vs CSR\n- Global state management \n- GraphQL vs REST\n- API gateway / reverse proxy \n- Authentication middleware \n- JWT vs Oauth \n- User roles / authorization \n- Payment integrations (Stripe)\n- Making your backend stateless and horizontally scalable \n- Serverless - pros and cons\n- Caching (Redis)\n- SQL vs NoSQL\n- CDN (Cloudflare)\n- Queues for processing tasks (SQS, rabbitMQ)\n- Containerization (Docker) \n- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)\n- Infrastructure security / zero trust\n- Service mesh\n- Monitoring / usage analytics / performance benchmarking \n- CICD pipelines \n- Automating infrastructure deployments and migrations (Terraform)",

They offered me an extension to stay for a 8 month work term (4 month on top of current). I was pleased at first but then I realized it might be a non-blessing in disguise.    \n\n\nProblem: There is only a limited number of work-terms in my program (5). If I decided to do an 8 month term, I will only have 2 left (one in fall and other in summer). If I were to go back to school for the spring-summer, I will have three terms remaining (one in fall, and the last 2 *both* in summer). Now onto the real problem, I really want to do an internship at a FAANG -level company and I think I have a shot at it. And for some reason, I'm convinced that my chances at securing such position will dramatically increase if I were to apply for a summer term.     \n\n\nEssentially it's this: good guaranteed opportunity costing me one summer term chance at Big Tech v.s  passing on a good opportunity for the reward of one extra summer chance at Big Tech.    \n\n\nAt this point, I'm so deep into hypotheticals that I'm not sure how I can be helped but that's basically it.    \n\n\nSome pertinent questions:  \n1) Are most big tech positions in the states? This is important because it would be difficult to get visa due to my nationality?  \n2)Do I still have a chance at big tech after coop or do they dramatically decrease once you settle in a fresh grad  full-time position after school?",

I also felt I constantly, always received negative feedback. It didn’t matter how much I did right or how much I produced. \n\nI think part of this stems from a very… toxic feeling culture. Everyone seems very on edge, overworked, and really spread thin. The expectations for everyone seemed to be a lot more than just what their job titles implied. The biggest red flag to me was when I told my mentor “I’m really trying but I can only do so much”, and he told me that he understands because he _got in yelling arguments in the office_ with my manager. I thought this might just be hyperbole, until I started seeing people be really rude and aggressive on public calls, singling out individuals \n\nAnyway, my manager in 1:1s, basically since I started, has implied that I am doing very poorly and am right on the edge of a PIP. He phrased it like “I really don’t want to but you’re close”. Because of this, when my lease expired, I didn’t feel comfortable renting a new place cause I always had an underlying feeling that I was gonna be fired the next day and I moved in with my parents or couch surfed or rented airbnbs. Basically homeless, tbh\n\nWork announced a return to office and now I’m afraid. The places I’ve been staying would be a huge commute to the office, like 2+ hours a day. Places in relative walking/public transit accessible to the office costs 3k minimum. What I’m really afraid of is getting a place, getting fired, and getting stuck with a lease in an ungodly expensive area\n\nThis is coupled with the market being pretty poor and many other companies following suit with return to office, but paying less. I have around 10 years experience. I’ve been considering reaching out to my previous job, but I’m not sure what I’d say \n\nWhat should I do? Is there anything else I should consider?",

What I thought was a check in with my training supervisors turned into an ambush by my boss and HR.\n\nThe reason for my firing was the poor quality of my work. I was in a training program which was known throughout the firm for placing data scientists on different teams after an intense 10 week training program. \n\nI struggled initially to understand the code base and complete my assignments to their level of quality. 4 weeks in, I received a feedback from my boss that my code quality was poor and I took that as a moment to work harder and improve. I feel like I greatly improved my work (I learned more R in two weeks than two years). But I guess it was too little too late. I never got to finish the training program and I’ve lost my healthcare.\n\nI have a non-CS degree in Economics, but I’ve interned as a Data Engineer at a start up and I got this position as a new grad. \n\nI need advice on how to bounce back from this. I started making new additions to projects on Github, I have a list of recruiters that I’ve reached out to and am ready to fire off emails. But I have a few questions.\n\n1. Do I list my new grad position on my resume?\n\n2. How do I explain my 7 weeks on my resume or a hiring manager?\n\n3. I’ve seen people make public posts on LinkedIn regarding their termination and asking their circles for referrals. Is that a wise strategy?\n\n4. Should I file for unemployment or is there a downside to doing so from a professional perspective?",

This fall I got a job with a contracting company where they train you and then send you out, I made it through the training, but wound up being laid off about two weeks ago. I've been applying since and managed to get one interview but didn't move forward. \n\nI guess I'd just like some input as to where I should go from here, considering that circumstances are bad and don't appear to be improving anytime soon. Here are my main questions. \n\n* Would you advise me to go back to school and keep working on getting a master's? I don't want to do this as I am sick of school but it may be the best thing to do with my time right now.\n* Should I include the job I had previously on my applications?

        "text": "**MY STORY SO FAR**:\n\n* Master’s degree in math.\n* 7 YOE in roles labeled either \"data scientist\" (DS) or \"data engineer\" (DE). TBH, the DS roles have felt like DE roles (no building of statistical models, more focus on dashboards, SQL, data warehouses). \n* Currently DE at FAANG.  Been at this job since 2021.\n\n**ISSUES AT THE MOMENT**:\n\n* **I find the job uninteresting.** I've never been super passionate about DE work – I got into it because the interviews were easier compared with DS interviews, and the positions were more plentiful. This job is especially boring as it's mostly building dashboards or chasing down DS and SWE partners to instrument logging or figure out what to put in the dashboards.\n* **I see limited growth potential at my current company.** I should clarify that I feel fortunate to have this job in the first place, and I know I’m compensated well (in the grand scheme of things). At my current company, I've seen many people get promoted to 1 level above me, but I see very few DEs who are 2+ levels above me. Here, DEs are paid less than SWEs (at equivalent levels). I am concerned that the limited focus of the work, combined with using primarily in-house tools, will make my skills less transferable later.\n* **I might get laid off soon.** We've had mass layoffs and we will likely have more, and there is increased pressure to PIP people. In my most recent performance review, I was rated sub-par, so I think that makes me more vulnerable.\n* **The economy is not doing so hot.**  Yeah yeah yeah, we all know.  I originally wrote a draft of this post before the Silicon Valley Bank mess.  I understand that things kinda suck right now, but I’m trying to think about my career 5-10 years in the future, and I don’t want to have regrets because I took the “safe” path just staying in my lane and keeping my head down.\n\n**WHAT I WOULD LIKE IN MY FUTURE CAREER**:\n\n* Build up my general SWE skills. I've started going through the curriculum on teachyourselfcs.com, and I do enjoy reading and doing the exercises in SICP.\n* Build up my stats &amp; ML skills. Even though my education was math-heavy, I'm still kinda light on stats. I have started reading \"Intro to Statistical Learning with R\" to fill in some gaps, and I intend to move on to teaching myself PyTorch.\n* Work in an area that hopefully uses more math, or at least an area that solves more interesting problems.\n* Work in an area that's relatively lucrative with significant growth potential.\n\n**POTENTIAL PATHS FORWARD**:\n\n* **Apply for jobs as an ML Engineer.** This would be a big leap at the moment since I still need to build up experience with a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow, and the job market is especially competitive. I do have experience in data at a FAANG company, and I have a STEM graduate degree, so maybe that would help me get my foot in the door at a smaller lower-paying company. Not actually sure, just guessing here. But I wouldn’t want to take a job paying less than $150K. \n* **Look for DE jobs, but aim for ones that have a broader scope.** Maybe something like a \"full-stack data scientist\" role where I would be doing both DE work and ML work.\n* **Apply for SWE jobs.** Maybe I could apply for backend jobs that are more data-adjacent (to get my foot in the door), or I could look for SWE  jobs that interface more directly with ML, or specialize in some other interesting topic.\n\n**QUESTIONS**:\n\n* **Q1**: Has anyone here switched job titles from data engineer to machine learning engineer? Or from data engineer to more general software engineer? Do you feel it was worth it?\n* **Q2**: Am I right in thinking the career path for data engineers is a bit more stunted compared to other areas in tech? Maybe I have that perception because, at my company, pay for DEs is lower compared to SWEs, and there are fewer people at higher levels. But maybe that's a myopic view. My girlfriend has tried to convince me not to fully abandon the DE path, pointing out how DEs are sometimes paid as much as SWEs  at other companies, and there is still a lot of demand for DEs.\n* **Q3**: In case people here think ML is overhyped (which it probably is, though I find it interesting), are there other areas of tech that people with math backgrounds have found enjoyable?\n\nLooking forward to people's thoughts on this, and thanks in advance!",

From my experience living in the US and EU, what I currently make is very comparable to a 100kish salary in a Big (or even med-big) city in the US. When the difference on salary really kicks in is when moving to senior level. In the US salary bump for senior is insane. Here I could get like 10k more, which will have basically no difference in my lifestyle and ability to save significantly more.\n\nSo my plan is to make senior level and then move to US for a senior role. Any tips for anyone who has done this? And if my predictions are right lol. \n\nAlso, I know I could move to germany or like Netherlands to have the best of both worlds but I can’t with their weather. I plan to move to Florida or California in US (miami/tampa or San Diego?) and get a remote/hybrid job (currently have a remote job for a US company in EU).",

        "text": "I just had my first ever tech assessment for a job. It was for a .NET job. They told me I could solve it with a console app, a WPF app or any other kind of app.\n\nThe assignment arrived five minutes late when I had just called the number of the guy supervising. I saw the mail come in and could cancel the call.\n\nThe mail said to confirm I got it and I commented it arrived five minutes late. I got a reply saying that he knew with a smiley face. Was that a part of the test? ShouldmI have tried to phone earlier? I found this odd.\n\nAnyhow, the test was 8 question out of which I had to do two. I just picked the first one and went to work without looking at the others. I did good on that one and did the second one. Because I'm quite unfamiliar with WPF I made a bit of a mess of this one and took more time. I ended up hard coding stuff I didn't want to in an ugly way because I didn't know how to interact with the xaml in a more sensible way so I could just iterate over some elements.\n\nI got the first two questions solved and working though.\n\nI then managed to do a third question two figuring it might get me bonus points. I sent in my results in time and am now waiting for an answer from them.\n\nDo you think me writing garbage code on a question will be a big detriment? I really don't know how to feel about my performance and am kinda anxious...",
