One thing that bothers her is that I have a hobby where I collect figurines and have been doing this before I met her. Now, they no longer bring me any joy so I’m selling them, but I think my gf has reached a point where she doesn’t respect me, at least somewhat due to my now previous hobby. \n\n\nAside from that, I think she looks at me with disappoint and doesn’t respect me any longer because I’m not particularly masculine looking. I have a condition which makes it difficult to gain weight and am in the process of trying to get medication changed so my condition is more stable for me to try and gain weight and work out. I’d love to finally, after years of dwelling on it, take my health and fitness serious and get in shape and gain some muscle. This will take time, but I can’t help but think my partner finds me somewhat pathetic because I’m skinny, balding but have a beard, and am not particularly tall. \n\n\nWhat I can change, I am working towards changing for me because I know it’ll make me happier (hopefully), feel more confident, and maybe by an indirect way will make her respect me again. \n\n\nTLDR: I don’t think my partner respects me due partly to my past hobby and appearance; how do I regain her respect? \n\n\nAny suggestions or options? Thank you.",

I am asking this question, because in the past when I have told guys I’ve had feelings for them, it has not been well received. \n\nI met a great guy, and less than two months into our friendship/connection, I had an anxiety attack. A bad one. I was developing heart issues due to my grandparents and caregiving for them. I also was developing strong feelings for this guy. I let him know both of these things, and that I did not feel worth it because I had been through so much, and was embarrassed because of my panic attack. I asked for space, knowing the choice I had made and that there was a chance he would not come back. \n\nHe checked on me later that day &amp; let me know that he was thinking of me &amp; hopes I was doing better. Shock number one. \n\nShock number two was due to the short time he had been in my life, I clearly let him know that I felt I had crossed boundaries and didn’t feel it was appropriate that I should come watch him coach. \n\nHe told me that none of what happened bothered him &amp; he hoped I would still come. He wound up finding me after the game &amp; gave me a huge hug. \n\nHe also told me he thought I was a special person, and my messages make him feel so special and he would always cherish them. \n\nHe’s never been anything but sweet to me. Why is he doing this after just one month? He could’ve found another girl. \n\nTL;DR crossing boundaries and feeling badly about a guy I like",

So, that’s my reassurance that it’s not just all in my head or overthinking. \n\nWhenever we see each other, I see her sizing me up. Whatever is told to her comes back to everyone at the job, so I don’t tell her not one thing about my private life (actually to none of my workers since most people gossip). I try my best to keep my head down, do my work efficiently, then I’m out!\n\nBut it’s bothering me: her shady comments and sizing me up. It’s every time we work together. I don’t have the best experience with catty women, and I’d like to hear how other deal with coworkers such as her. I don’t want to stoop to her level because her character is trash.",

        "text": "I (30F) love my partner (32M). He is my best friend and we also collaborate on projects at work frequently and make a great team. I honestly cannot imagine a world where he is not in my life in some way. We have been together for five years, with many periods of long-distance due to our work lives. \n\nHowever, since turning 30, for the past six months, I feel like instead of being engaged in a loving relationship I grow more and more restless. Everyday I carry out the actions that I know are the actions of a loving girlfriend. Everyday I continue to work on a custom made hand sewn quilt for him. But everyday the voice in my head telling me that this isn't it grows stronger and stronger. I often feel like I am battling an inner demon that just wants to ruin things in my life for no good reason. \n\nI do have reasons to doubt my relationship but these are all issues we're working on and regularly discuss. To provide an overview of it all these include :\n\ni) **marriage &amp; family**: when will we get married? I wanted to be engaged as of 2 years ago but he still does not want to. Will we have children? I am indifferent leaning towards no but imaging raising children with him makes it a hard no on my end - I am not interested in parenting a family with this man.\n\n ii) **location** : where will we live? we have not yet settled in one location and are regularly bouncing around between multiple locations. He is happy with this nomadic lifestyle but I want to be settled down in a more permanent position within the next 2 years. \n\niii) **my social life**: despite not wanting to admit it, he gets jealous. he does not like when I am alone with men, or even more generally when I engage in friendly conversation with men as he sees this as a potential threat. While he says he trusts me, it's hard to feel that way when it feels more like he thinks I am going to suck on the penis of every man I pass. \n\nIn addition to these topics that we discuss, I have deeper darker topics which I have spent a lot of time reflecting on for over a year now. These are topics for things I know he would not agree with but are things that the more I reflect on, the more I want to experience. Without going into too much detail, they include sexual acts (e.g., MMF group sex - he is not interested in this and it is something I have brought up as a \"what if\" scenario before), newly developed fetishes (ones that he does not find interest in participating in with me), recreational drug use/alcohol use (I have never tried weed. it's legal where we are and I am starting to want to at least experience this. the same goes for alcohol - he is completely sober and does not enjoy the idea of me being intoxicated). \n\nIs it normal to reach an age or point in a relationship where you just start to doubt everything? He is my first healthy relationship (and even with that there are red flags due to his jealousy and occasional controlling behaviour) and has helped me to build so much self-confidence that I finally feel happy and non-dependent on anyone (including him). However, due to being in multiple highly abusive relationships before him in my late teens/early twenties, and generally having an unhealthy relationship with sex, until very recently, I just feel like that part of me is missing that I need to explore. \n\nDespite feeling this way, I still can't help but to continue on the actions of being with him. I love him. But I just don't know if I \\_love\\_ him in a way that a romantic partner should due to their doubting thoughts and dissatisfaction I have for the aspects of my life (e.g., fetishes, drug/alcohol use) that he currently has more control over. Am I being immature for thinking that there are things I deserve to experience? If my feelings are valid, how can I communicate this all to him without blowing everything up entirely? I cannot stress enough how much I love and care for this man but at the same time I feel like I am on the verge of having a mental breakdown myself as I feel like I am just carrying out a check list of actions that are expected of me as his partner and that don't actually reflect what I want to currently experience in my life.\n\nTLDR: I love my partner more than anything in the world and he is my best friend. However, I am experiencing a lot of inner turmoil and doubt of how I am living my life and things just don't feel right. Is this normal to experience in a long-term relationship and does it just blow over with time?",

He said the night he met me I was being a sl\\*t.\n\n(Some background information - his girlfriend in his past relationship cheated on him with his friend).\n\nHe apologised, I grew distant for about a month after this, and then eventually things went back to normal. This was an extremely warped, unusual experience for us as he is normally super calm, stable and trusting. I told myself if he ever said it again that I would leave.\n\nThen for the second time, he called me a sl\\*t after another night out (a pattern occurring) as my friends and I were late coming home as we were trying and get a friend to come home who seemed like she might cheat on her partner.\n\nAt this period of time, he was also feeling depressed, stressed, and I suspect that he was having suicidal thoughts. I have a feeling he was sabotaging the relationship out of fear. I have empathy for him because I've also gone through this, and I would lash out to the person who was closest to me at the time because I was hurting.\n\nAbout 6/7 months have passed and nothing like this has happened since. We've been good, stable and loving, but I haven't forgotten it. I don't think he fully understands the weight of his words and how this made me feel. When I brought it up again, he told me to not dwell on negative things and to try and be positive.\n\nIs this something I should forgive? Would you move past this?\n\nTL;DR!

They also made the decision to leave each others lives and it should stay that way.\n\nI’m not insecure within myself, I’m just irritated because I feel like it’s disrespectful. She’s the one who initiated contact with him. She didn’t tell me when they started talking again.\n\nTwo weeks ago she asked me if I wanted to go out with this dude and his girlfriend and I said no. Like why the fuck would I want to do that? We didn’t fight but she said I was being ‘unfair’ because I wouldn’t even try.\n\nThat irritated be because she’s the same girl that asked me to get rid of my female best friend because our relationship is was too dependent upon each other and it made her uncomfortable.\n\nI’d been friends with my friend since we were 12 and we are in our 30’s now. I explained to my friend that I saw a future with this girl and her comfortability is what meant the most to me right now. I said if that meant get rid of unimportant people then that what I was going to do. I wasn’t trying to be a dickhead but looking back at the conversation now I see that I was.\n\nMy best friend said we had been friend for 18 years (at the time if this conversation) and that if something was going to happen between us it would have already.\n\nI asked my friend to understand that I had to at least give it a try. My friend was sad with me but she said it was cool and that she wanted me to be happy.\n\nI told her that if it didn’t work out I totally be back but she didn’t say anything. She just looked at me for a few seconds then said she had to get back to work.\n\nWe didn’t speak or text after that until she was getting married. She and I had a pact. I would be her (man) of honor and she would be my best (woman) at our weddings. When she reached out she said it was time.\n\nI was excited but my girlfriend went on this whole if you do it, it’s over rant. Obviously me not wanting to lose her I declined. She hasn’t reached out to me since then.\n\nPart of me feels like I’m being dramatic and the other part of me feels like she’s overstepping boundaries that I set in the beginning of the relationship. \n\nI don’t know. I’m going to talk to her tonight so any advice is welcome. Thanks.\n\nTL;DR: I’m breaking up with my Girlfriend because she’s talking to her ex boyfriend and I feel like it’s a deal breaker.",

        "text": "TL;DR my friend’s daring woes is impacting our friendship and not sure what to say to him\n\n\nHey Reddit, I’m using this on my phone so excuse the structure. \n\nMy friend and I have been friends since college, I was a freshman and he was a junior I think. We were both in rotc together in college and he commissioned in the reserves and just got out. I commissioned in the national guard but I’m still in. We become close friends and I got along well . In college he had no trouble dating &amp; a couple gf’s \n\nAfter college is when I noticed things change for him he complained how hard dating is after college then talked about how women don’t care about money they just want “fun “  “immature” guys. He’s 6’1 &amp; made decent money and a regular dude so I can’t tell you why. I took him at his word until I graduated and had no issues dating and he started to resent me. I’m 5’10 and him and I have similar salaries (I make slightly more but 113k to his 108k). But I’m salaried &amp; he can work overtime so he typically gets more than me. He would claim my dating success is because “I dress like I’m from the streets/hood”. We both black but that pisses me off when he says that because I dress normal &amp; he’s making excuses. The truth is he lacks confidence and girls don’t like that. I ended up finding a gf (she’s perfect) last year who makes decent money and his resentment grew. \n\n\nHe then moved to Forth Worth because “dating in the DMV area is atrocious “ and he seemed excited and less bitter until he moved there and his dating woes continues then he just snapped. He gets mad at me for being in a relationship when giving him advice. Claims my gf likes me for my looks and not my character. There’s so much more but idk what to do anymore \n\n\n\n\nAny advice is appreciated",

        "text": "\nHey reddit, could really use some advice as I really fucked up.\n\nDisclaimer, we have been together for about 6 years. The other day my girlfriends laptop had a problem and needed to borrow mine for her college exams. When she was using my laptop she had gotten on to my email and into my google storage where i had a screen shot of a girls ass on there. We had gone to highschool with this girl but didnt know her or talk to her. She posts scandulous pictures sometimes and deletes them so I had saved it stupidly when she posted a few months back and the next day i had regretted it and deleted it. It was of her getting a tattoo and her ass was out in it. She found it in my trash folder while searching around.\n\nIm so disappointed in myself. And before anyone says it I dont blame her for snooping around. Shes already very insecure and I try to make her feel beautiful despite her self confidence issues that stem from mental illness. Im just looking for advice of how to move forward. I really feel awful and like I dont even deserve to be with her but she says that weve been together so long and she doesnt want to lose that and doesnt want to break up.\n\nTL;DR I made a really dumb choice with screenshotting and don’t know how to move forward with my girlfriend.",

        "text": "Me and my gf have been dating for around 5 years now. Although most of the time I feel good about being with her, we can get into arguments about how I should treat her quite easily. For example, when she’s on her period, she gets upset if I am not around comforting her. I often feel pressured to do something to make her feel better. The feeling of being pressured makes me feel very uncomfortable and that often leads to me being angry at her for not respecting my feelings and accepting me for who I am. It feels like an endless cycle. \n\nAnother thing is that I don’t feel attracted to her sexually, probably because of the pressure I feel from her not accepting me for who I am. Should my feelings be respected completely in the relationship or is that just me being insecure and I should improve on myself?\n\ntl;dr: gf and I always get into arguments about how I treat her. Should I be accepted for who I am or am I just being insecure?",

She told me that she gave him oral and ensured that they never had sexual intercourse and that it was only a one time thing. I found out because I told her I was hanging out with him so she had to break the news. This honestly tore me because my cousin is like a brother to me and I really love this girl. Im curious to know how you all might respond to this if you were in this situation? Im not sure what to do. She had no idea he was my cousin until I brought him up that day. I feel weird knowing they’ve been intimate with each other, mainly because it’s my cousin.\n\nTLDR: my girlfriend and close cousin were intimate once before I dated her or knew of her; not sure what to do about it or if I should get over it",

        "text": "  \n\nFirst of all, I want to apologize for mistakes, English isn't my native language x)\n\n   \n \n\nI'll try not to be long but to be simple, it started online on discord with a boy.\n\nSince the first time we spoke/went on a call it was surprisingly so smooth like we knew each other since a lot. (it was in August) Anyway, life goes on and we speak everyday or almost, sometimes hours and we kinda flirt but in a funny way as we live hours apart you know.\n\nBut 1 month after we start joking about seeing each other soon\n\nBut the prices of the train.......... Anyway, we continue our daily conversations (and we play sometimes, as it was initially why we started talking) We're getting closer and we start doing factimes time to time, we still call for hours, send pics... Sharing our lives in fact \n\nTime passes and we both start being more... On +18 stuff, at first kinda soft ofc but during Christmas holidays we both agree that something may be happening between us after we saw everything from the other, let's say... Since, we talked seriously about seeing each other for the next vacations (so the next month). \n\nThings are absolutely great during that time, we're getting more and more excited bc we can't wait to see each other. He literally acts like my bf (yeah, from distance but you know what I mean ok)\n\nHe gives me nicknames for example (I tell him not to use those for nothing bc it means a lot to me, so he's aware and all) Finally I go 1 week to his house, it was so perfect, no awkward moments, we still tease each other, went to the restaurant several times, spa, cinema, museum and all\n\nI mean- perfect dates???\n\nAnd ofc we had sex, we knew it would happen as we spoke about it before\n\nAnd the day before I left, I asked him if he wanted me to come-back, he said yes, then asked him what were we, how does he sees things from now And first, he couldn't answers and asked me about my thoughts... Told him I wanted to be official, like trying even tho he told me at the beginning of our meeting (August again) that he wasn't really in distance stuff (bc his previous relations, the longest he had, started like that, and he said it's pretty hard)... And we talked about that the next day while I was on the train, and he said he loves me a lot, he got attached to me, but he doesn't got the special sparkle, but since he loved everything that happened between us, he wants to continue that way and so being kinda sex friends (even if struggled to admit it)\n\nHe said that yeah, he \"doesn't see in the future\", and that it's only \"currently\" that he feels that way... And I only focus on those words, like maybe he'll change, maybe he's afraid and all idk but we both think it's due to the distance....\n\nI'm back home since 3weeks now, for 2 weeks I was so depressed, it still happens, we still speak a lot but a lil less as he got a new job and started playing with online guys (so he needs to speak with them, before, we were on call while he was playing solo) etc\n\nWe only had 2 \"hot times\" since, bc of me tbh As he got everything without being official I want to make him realize that if he wants things it needs to be exclusive in fact..... \n\nMaybe I'm wrong, probably, even tho I did it twice.. Even if it will hurt, I still tell myself I'll go again to see him in one month, stuff will probably happen (I'm not a fool)\n\nBut I want to make him realize that despite some fears, distance, it can works, that his sparkle can come later (as it happened to me before with an ex).. And this, before I come or at least when I'm there\n\n   \n \n\n    **TL;DR;** : Just a boy who wants things casual, not really my whish but from what he said he seems a lil open and maybe needs to realize some things? And so I hope to find help/tips to make him change.",

This has kind of shown some true colors, things are starting to make sense, some other comments she's made I've ignored in the past, etc.\nShe also makes a ton of weird comments about my income (husband is a PA), and tells people \"I'm loaded\". I don't like that. Particularly because we both grew up on welfare and worked very hard to be where we are now.\n\nI'm in her wedding party and I've done my best with trying to hold out until the wedding is over for her. I was trying to let this fizzle but we will be in school for the next four years together. She actually has a sort of \"burn list\" of people she has already collected that have \"wronged her\" that she won't be helping during our clinical year. I am mortified and there are a lot of other reasons why I don't want to be this person's friend anymore.\n\nThe issue is I think she has caught on to me being upset and has asked me every single day for the last week if I'm okay. Last week I \"snapped\" and said I am, but if you keep asking me, I'm going to get really annoyed. She then gave me the silent treatment for three days, posted some passive-aggressive things on FB, and texted me today asking if I was stressed about her wedding. It is constantly about her it seems, which to be fair, I get, it's her wedding, but what if I really did have a problem that I just didn't want to talk about? She isn't respecting my boundaries and replied with \"k\". \n\nI really just don't want to ruin someone's wedding so I'm trying to hold out but it's pretty clear she is either too afraid to boot me, or really doesn't want to let this go. I feel like she is the vindictive type and I have tried so hard to let our friendship simmer out as much as I can without completely cutting her out before her wedding. \n\nWhat can I do to gracefully end the friendship without this getting sticky? I cannot outright say my concern with her is that she is r*cist because that appears to get your post booted.\n\nTL;DR: my friend is a bigot and I don't know how to handle telling her/not telling her, avoiding a long and awkward 4 years.",

We're planning on introducing each other to our parents this summer and afterwards watching the northern lights together.\n\nRecently, I've been noticing that he's being less affectionate towards me. \n\nFor example, every morning before work he usually texts, “good morning babe/cutie, I love you” etc..... \n\nNow he usually says, “good morning” \n\nYesterday, when we were calling he didn't say I love you. He texted “I love you”. \n\nI want to bring it up, but I know he's currently going through a lot of stress.\n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend isn't saying I love you as much.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm needing some advice on my (26f) relationship with my partner (29m) of 3 years. Over our relationship, I've come to realise that he is not that great with money and accepting responsibility.\n\nHe can struggle with having enough money for everyday life because of debt he has got himself into (crashing a car and not having insurance), buying a car on loan, and money he owes me that I loaned him for a different car. He also spends money on his car because a) it's his hobby and what makes him happy, and b) he feels like his car is going to help him in his career and make him look professional.\n\nHe also has fines that he does not pay because he can't afford too. From my perspective, it seems like he is avoiding responsibility and thinking that if he ignores the fines, they'll go away. He told me he will always get fines because it's part of life. He has, however, agreed with me that loans are a no-go moving on. \n\nI'm worried his attitude toward money, authority and debt will continue on and potentially negatively affect us if we start a family in the future. The other part of me thinks that we are still pretty young and we'll both get better at managing money as we get older (I have a very small amount of debt and no savings, which I'm working on).\n\nAside from this, he works super hard physically and has goals for his career. He is loyal and has a great work ethic.\n\nAny time I try to give him advice or input into the money issues, he seems to brush me off and I get the feeling he thinks I don't know what I'm talking about. I do feel that I approach issues logically, calmly, and maturely.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for insight from other people here. I know that money can be a huge issue in partnerships and marriage and if people don't see eye to eye it's not a great sign. But at the same time, I don't want to leave him just because of this. Money's never been a huge thing for me, but I want to be somewhat comfortable and not struggle in the future. \n\nI know a serious talk with him is in need, but at the same time I know I won't be able to change his attitude toward the above as it's so deeply ingrained in his own personal issues. \n\nThanks so much if you read this far.\n\nTL;DR! My partner is not great at managing money and has got himself into debt. I'm worried about how this will impact our future due to his attitude toward it.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11n44he/i_f30_started_to_like_someone_before_i_found_out/",
        "text": "Sorry in advance, this is going to be long. \n\nI(F30) met Brock(M21) through OL gaming. I meet many people that way, of all ages/genders. I do my best to be nice &amp; kind to everyone. I just want people to feel included for who they are, I’ve always been that way. \n\nWhen I first met Brock I didn’t care about what his age was, he had a deepish voice and seemed somewhat mature so I assumed he was 25-27. I don’t ask people their age because it doesn’t matter or contribute to the game, so I think it’s creepy to ask.\n\nI ended up making a really good group of OL friends, some including my HS friends. There were two guys, including Brock. Brock and the other guy Darren became best buds. Brock was newest to the group, but for months he &amp; Darren became inseparable. One night Brock invited his irl friend to play &amp; Darren got super mad/weird about it, like jealous. He ended up being rude to us all, especially Brock’s friend, &amp; even left our group chat. Brock was upset/confused about the whole thing &amp; eventually we found out Darren had removed us all from the game. Then Darren started messaging Brock privately as if nothing happened. Every time Darren did something new Brock would call/text me and talk to me about it until we both agreed to just block him since he was causing unnecessary drama which isn’t our vibe at all.\n\nAfter all that our group didn’t play as much &amp; it slowly became just Brock &amp; I trying to get the group to play with us with no response. I’ll admit that as we played more alone together, I started to like Brock. He was kind, sweet, caring, &amp; funny. We told each other all kinds of stories &amp; would just be laughing constantly. I since it was OL I didn’t pursue it or anything.\n\nEventually over a few months we gained a new group of friends, &amp; they asked us how old we were. That was when I found out Brock was only 21. That halted my crush quite a bit but I found myself getting lost in the fun we had playing, I’d kinda forget about his age. I didn’t think he had a crush on me anyway since now he knew I was so much older. He treats everyone the same regardless of who they are, just like I do. So again didn’t think much of it. When he was friends with Darren they talked all the time too, calling each other for hours.\n\nRecently he’s opened up to me about how he’s only ever had one gf &amp; doesn’t like any girls his age. He told me how he had flings with older women (F28-34) but they never dated or kissed, that he just liked them for a while &amp; it fizzled out. He also sent me a photo of a girl who was closer to his age-27 that his friends were trying to hook him up with but she had a kid so he knew it wouldn’t work out long term as he didn’t want that. One night he brought up how he wishes I could come out with some of the people we play with so we could all hang out. He also said the same to Darren and all of us previously, so this wasn’t anything new. He just wants to have fun with us all in person since we all got on so well online.\n\nCouple weeks later he said that he likes me. I said he doesn’t even know me but he insisted that he does cuz we have talked about so many things. That he hasn’t felt this way about anyone in his town &amp; he’s never liked a girl he talks to only over the phone before. I told him I was flattered &amp; liked him too but its inappropriate because of my age. He said he doesn’t care about that &amp; likes me for who I am. He thinks older women are “better” anyway because all the girls he knows his age have nothing to talk about &amp; sleep around but sex is more important to him than that, which is why he hasn’t hooked up with anyone in a few years. His friend group has a ton of friends &amp; party all the time so he’s had opportunities to hook up with other people if he wanted to. I do really like/care about him, and he was very adamant that he doesn’t care about my age even though I’ve protested it multiple times.\n\nWe have now gotten to the point where we talk even more, sometimes multiple nights in a row whether we are playing the game or not. He gets up super early for work so he always messages me good morning, he gets sad when I tell him I can’t talk, but he’s always really nice/understanding about it. I try to put some distance between us &amp; do my own things without talking to him, or when he wants to call me on his drive home from work I think up excuses why I can’t talk. But when I do, it seems to make him like me even more. I like him a lot and want the best for him, which makes me have a really hard time with this.\n\nWhen I was younger, older guys constantly used me for my body &amp; preyed on me because they were my bosses, managers, or whatever. I look back and some of the relationships were kinda hot (I was 18-22 and they were 38-45) but some make me cringe cuz they were so creepy &amp; not even attractive, but at the time being young I thought they were mature &amp; had their shit together when they didn’t. I’ve never dated or been involved with anyone more than 2 years younger than me, so this is completely new to me &amp; I’m not sure how to navigate this or if I’m being over-dramatic.\n\nBottom line: I cannot unsee this situation as if the roles were reversed and I was some creepy 30yo dude talking this much to a 21yo girl. One of my friends is 31M dating 20F &amp; I secretly lost a bit of respect for him over it. I’m torn because ever since I turned 27 &amp; realized how I actually felt about those past relationships I was in, I’ve strongly felt that type of age gap to be an unfair dynamic in a romantic relationship. But I started to like him before I knew how young he was, so there’s also a piece of my brain that still sees him as the 25-27yo I thought he was for months.\n\nI’ve told him all of this, &amp; he still insists that I’m not creepy &amp; that his friend likes me too. He loves how nice/sweet/kind I am &amp; how we can talk about anything. He really wants to come visit me or have me come visit him. He started saying that he finally feels like he would want to hook up with someone, that he hasn’t felt that type of spark in a long time. I’m beyond flattered but I also just really can’t get past thinking this is so wrong. Like I said, I can’t unsee the fact that if the roles were reversed this would be honestly, in my opinion, absolutely disgusting.\n\nAny thoughts/advice much welcomed\n\nTLDR: I started to develop a crush with my online friend and later found out he was 21, but since I’m basically ten years older I feel like a creep, especially when I think about if the roles were reversed.",

I met him on an online dating app. We just went on a first date yesterday and I feel like he is putting me on a pedestal. He told me he found me patient, he 'loves my positivity'/'you are a very positive person', said it was the 'best date of \\[his\\] life', that I was kind, smart. Today, he told me that I was smart, beautiful, and dorky and he just wanted to learn more about me. I know we talk a lot, but he still barely knows me. I could be all those things or none of those things.\n\nI am kind of (it's not good) used to disinterested or shy partners, so I am unsure if this is too fast due to that. We did kiss and hold hands on the date. \n\nI mentioned that I didn't get enough sleep last night and would need a nap today. He said that I also needed cuddles, dogs/cats, and snacks. I feel like what I really need is just to rest and the thought of cuddling with someone I met online that I barely know fills me with fear and dread, and doesn't sound relaxing nor the answer to not feeling exhausted. Am I being too cautious or too judgemental? How should I handle this?\n\nTL;DR Guy I have been talking to for a week and went on date with kept giving me a ton of compliments throughout date and some while texting. I told him I was exhausted and wanted a nap, and he mentioned I also needed cuddles. I feel uncomfortable with the thought cuddling a stranger and that this is going too fast. Am I wrong?

We’re just over the “honeymoon” stage and are a bit more in a normal routine.\n\nHe’s brought up it up a couple of times now asking what’s going on and saying I never want to have sex anymore, which isn’t the case.

It honestly puts me off because it feels like he’s pushing me. \n\nIt’s only been a few days since we’ve had sex to put things into perspective - not like it’s been weeks/ months. I just feel like, to me, he sounds juvenile complaining. Like he’s a teenager, not an adult. Especially because he insinuates that somethings wrong with me for being tired and asks me why I’m tired all the time when he sees me waking up at 5am and then getting home at 11-12pm. \n\nHe’ll literally lay in bed on his phone saying “I’m not tired” and nudging me and then sulking when I’m trying to drift off. He’s a 33 yr old man. Wtf? And then he brings up me never wanting to have sex and I have to defend myself when I’m honestly so wrecked from the day.\n\nMy concern is, am I going to keep having to do this every time we don’t have sex for ONLY a few days?

        "text": "Timeline of important breakdown:\n\n1. October 2022: Him (30M) and I (25F) met. I get easily attached, and in the beginning even I was off-put by his forwardness. He said it was fate, he was telling me how he told all of his friends about me, I was meeting his friends, love at first sight, calling me all the time. It seemed genuine and I let my guard down after awhile and we got very close fast. He started spending a lot of time at my apartment and still does. He lives with his parents but is at my place more.\n\n2. Nov.-Dec.: His ex is still contacting him. He explains that his ex was abusive physically and emotionally, the texts he showed me/her criminal record back up what he says. He sets boundaries that they will never be together again, shows me the texts, I am comfortable with this because he’s transparent. \n\n3. New Years: I say I love you for the first time. He said it before me but I didn’t say it back at the same time.\n\n3. January 2023: He loses his license from a previous issue where he lost it and didn’t handle the paperwork properly (insurance related). I looked up his record and know what happened, he did not commit a crime. \n\n4. Jan-Feb: Because of the driving situation, he needed a lot of support with rides and finances because he wasn’t able to work. He started a new job in Feb, I helped him a lot with covering food, giving him rides, letting him stay with me a lot. Now that he’s more financially stable, he has helped out with groceries and gas.\n\n5. Feb.: I see a random text pop up from his ex, I question him about it, he lies multiple times, turns out she sent him a nude and he responded “hawt.” I never got to see the texts but I did try and he since deleted them. I ended things in the moment when he admitted that. His ex’s parents also renewed his car insurance for him. \n\nMy anxiety is not great. One second, I’m anxious I’m being used and taken advantage of, the next I’m sympathizing of how difficult his situation is right now and do believe his ex was abusive and he claims he felt a sick need to please her and play into her antics. He described the picture she sent and it did not sound sexy and sounded more funny and was from when they were together. He said he didn’t feel anything from the picture. \n\nHe has since told his ex he’s seeing someone and to not to contact him, and blocked her on everything. She even went as far as contacting his mom which IMO does show that she’s not stable. Please keep in mind there’s way more background I’m not explaining to try to keep this concise, but she genuinely sounds abusive.\n\nI’ve still been helping him with rides after a few weeks and letting him stay with me a lot. I really can’t tell if I’m being taken advantage of or if he’s genuine. Any advice is welcome. I really deeply care about him and love him, I tried to end things initially but decided to hear him out and now we are back together.\n\nTD;LR: I go back and forth between feeling like I’m being lied to and taken advantage of to believing that my\nPartner is being genuine and cares about me. I feel stuck in an anxious loop of loving him and trusting him, then being afraid of him hurting me emotionally and distrusting him.",

        "text": "I'm at a loss. I don't know what more I can do and I'm being the only parent remotely trying to cooperate for the sake of the kids and it's draining me. (This is not the only thing...) She's rarely answering any messages (I never ever send her any messages that is not SOLELY about the kids) I send her. Anyways, for the first time in her life she's gotten a full-time job (her first week now). She has to deliver the kids in kindergarten at 7 in the morning and picks them up just before they close, which is 5 in the evening. Our oldest has diabetes and her blood sugar is usually very unstable during her hours there. Since I start pretty late the week I don't have my kids I've offered to take them for a few hours and deliver them around breakfast time in the kindergarten so that their days aren't so long and draining (especially for my eldest). She agreed and I've done so since Monday until today. She suddenly sent me a message earlier saying that she will start to deliver them themselves because she needs to learn how to deliver them herself(?) I asked if I can please continue to do so, I do not want anything for it. There's genuinely no crazy agenda going on here, please trust me. It's purely for my kids wellbeing. My oldest has told me a few times this week how she finds it sad that her mom picks them up so late, and almost always last. So this is killing me. They now have to spent an extra 2 hours there, every day. 10 hours each day seems way too excessive, especially when they don't need to. I don't know what I want from this post, but I just need some support I guess. Maybe I'm overreacting and it's not a big deal, but my heart and every bone is aching in my body and I just can't seem to shake it off. What's the problem of me having them a few hours each morning when it's her hours? She's at work anyways. Am I a snowflake or whatever here?\n\nSorry for a wall of text, word salad or any typos...\n\nTdlr: My ex would rather have the kids spend 10 hours in the kindergarten on her weeks than to let them spend some extra time with me.",

A recent “talk” we had, she said sex is not important in a marriage. She says intimacy to her is, rubbing her back, combing her hair,taking care of things for her like laundry cleaning etc, holding her hand in public, holding at night just to name a few. I do 100% of everything she needs and wants. I know exactly what her love languages are and take care of all of them. Literally the only thing I need is consistent sexy time. I’d be happy with once a week. But she can’t do that for me. Basically she gets what she needs and wants and I get what I need whenever she decides to give it to me. And yes I am very giving during sexy time. She always “gets off” . Sometimes multiple times.\n\nSo my main question is… those In a healthy marriage, how many times a week/month/year do you and your spouse have sexy time?\n\nTL;DR what is a healthy frequency of sexy time?",

There are 2 single women. \n\nThe newest person (6 months) within this group is Michelle. Michelle is getting married. Despite being the newest, she has been childhood friends with one of the single women. Michelle's fiancé technically not part of this group's identity (based on groupchat and our common-links). I've actually only met Michelle maybe 5 times total, so I'm not offended that i'm not going because I don't know her well.\n\n All of the women have their own subgroup which does 3x yoga, so they've bonded extremely well in a short amount of time. As a result, they've received invites for the wedding less than 30 days away. I assume they were not part of the initial wave of guest invites based on conversations, except her childhood friend. All of the women received a wedding invite including their husband/boyfriend as plus ones. The other single guy didn't get invited either which is completely understand. \n\nAnyways, the women were openly talking about it, I made zero comments about the event. Suddenly one of women asked me I was going to get Michelle a wedding gift. I responded that \"I barely know her, wasn't invited, but it also makes sense why I'm not going\". They pretty all encouraged that I should still get her a wedding gift to show support. I don't even know the name of the fiance to be honest. I said \"I'll probably get her a hallmark card\". But to be honest, I think it will be even more awkward if I do get her a gift. Michelle never asked for a gift herself from me. I don't think she's expecting one anyways. For some reason, everybody keeps bring the topic up (including their husbands). THe other single guy and I are the same page we don't care. It's getting really annoying with the guilt tripping when they say \"You're not getting her anything?\"\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: getting guilt tripped into giving a wedding gift to somebody i barely know and wasn't invited to.

For the last month or so, I have felt us growing further and further apart. We are very different people with very different values. We don't connect about many things, especially the things I am the most passionate about. As much as I love him, I feel like I am missing out on parts of myself. This is my first longterm relationship, and I have learned so much about myself. But it feels like we have gone as far as we can, and we are now holding each other back.\n\nHowever, we are in college, live together with multiple other roommates, and have just resigned our lease until July 2024 (a year and six months from now). Our decision affects everyone, but I also know our decision must be based on how WE feel. I feel so overwhelmed, buried, helpless. Relationship stress, housing stress, and school stress have all layered upon each other to the point that I just want to stick it out and make the best of it. But I know that is not fair to either of us. All I can think about is how intertwined our lives are, how difficult it will be to undo all of that, and how long and hard the process will be of finding myself again. We lean on each other so much (or at least I lean on him), that imagining my life without that kind of support seems impossible.\n\nI would love any help, opinions, advice, alternate perspectives, really anything.\n\nThank you for your time &lt;3\n\nTDLR: How do you go through a breakup when you live together and with other roommates?",

Luckily for me, I have been seeing a psychatrist for almost 2 years now. I am making progress but I still have a long way to go. My ex however, couldn't see a doctor yet because he doesn't have the necessary money. He isn't a lazy person. He is highly educated and used to have a well paying job but he quit because of his issues.\n\nMy ex has a bad habit of ghosting me from time to time and when he comes back he says that he wasn't responding to my messages because he was so depressed. That hurts a lot but I used to tolerate it. A few days ago, I asked him if he will see a doctor, he said not yet since he doesn't have a job so I sent him a heart warming message trying to lift him up. He blocked me afterwards! No explanation. Nothing. I am deeply hurt and confused since only a few days ago he said he loved me and if he was financially stable he would propose to me. I don't get it.\n\nNow I am hurt and angry at him for doing this to me. But at the same time I am worried he might hurt himself or commit suicide. His brother killed himself last year so I am really worried. I am thinking of sending him money and telling him that now he can see a doctor even though he is ignoring me but I have conflicted feelings. On one hand, I am hurt by his actions and I am not a rich person but on the other hand I don't want to regret not helping him. I only have around 1000$ in my savings and that's quite a respectable amount of money in my country so I am thinking of sending it to him and waiting for my next paycheck. It will be difficult but I think I might be able to do it since I live with my parents and I am not the only one paying the bills and buying groceries around the house. Part of me though is wondering does he even deserve this much sacrifice? Does he even think of me or acknowledge the terrible way he's been treating me? Would he do the same for me if he was in my shoes? I am lost. Please help. Should I help him or should I let it go?\n\nThanks!\n\nTl; dr I am not sure whether to give my ex boyfriend money so he can get the mental health treatment he needs or not.",

I don’t have Reddit but he told me about the wedding forums on here, I thought maybe it was more of an interpersonal communication issue over a wedding technicality so chose to post here instead. I can change it to over to a wedding thread tho if needed.\n\nAnyways, we are getting married next spring. When we announced our engagement around xmas his family was kind of surprised we would have a wedding vs. just eloping or at the court house. But when his mom realized we did want a fairly big wedding she mentioned that I could wear her dress. I kind of waved it off and non-commitally said thanks…I thought she was just being nice.\n\nWe were at their house this past weekend and she has the dress out and brings it up again. But acting as if I had agreed to it. I was shocked and said I had already been shopping around and had my eye on a few specific styles…I wish I would’ve just said I bought on already, even though that’s not true. \n\nBut she was like, No no well now you can stop (like it would be a relief to me) and said it was more traditional this way. My fiancé, who has since apologized, was all like: Oh cool! That will save a buck! \n\nThis dress is like an 80s style I think. It’s not horrible but definitely not what I wanted. It’s satin with lace, puffy shoulders, a high neck, and a chest cut out. Also, the lace looks a little yellow to me…I pointed that out saying I think it aged and she told me no, that’s how it’s supposed to look. I’m also a lot shorter than her so I mentioned that and she said she wouldn’t mind if I got it shortened but that I could just wear high heels. \n\nI said, oh well I’m still pretty invested in these other styles I was looking at but I will consider it.\n\nShe got noticeably sad and said some things about tradition and connecting the families and stuff. She point blank asked if I thought the dress was ugly. I said no because I really don’t…it’s just dated and not me, I didn’t say the dated part tho. The conversation kind of fizzled out at that point.\n\nOn the way home I was like, dude I cannot wear that dress! And my fiancé realized that yeah that was kind of a big ask and that someone like me who is so into clothes would ofc want to pick my own. He said he thought I might like it cuz it looked like a “renaissance dress”…his words, not mine. We laughed about it and I really thought it might be over. \n\nBut just today she texted him asking about times I can meet to visit a tailor for the dress!!!!! We haven’t  responded yet. We don’t text each other, and have just been communicating on his phone from time to time. We’ve been dating for 5 years but have only visited his parents like 5 times…I’m not really close to them. Nothing is sour but they and my fiancé just aren’t the super close type—they are from northern Europe if that means anything. \n\nHere’s the thing, I know I need to be direct and say no. I wish I already would have. But it’s hard because I don’t want to hurt her feelings. What should I say to her that is kind but firm? Should I call or text? \n\nThank you, \n\n\nTl;dr - MIL wants me to wear her wedding dress to our wedding, but I don’t want to. How can I tell her no as nicely as possible?",

        "text": "I feel so lost and confused. I (29F) have been dating a guy (28M) who lived in Denver for 7 months which is where I have always wanted to live. Everything has been amazing with him. We visited back and forth multiple times and I thought we had an amazing connection. We talked all the time about me getting a job so I could move out there. So I did. I got my dream job. I was so excited to share the news with him. And within a week of sharing the news that he seemed excited about, he OUT OF NOWHERE broke up with me. I feel so blind sided and confused. And now I don’t know what to do. Do I move 1,500 miles away on my own which will be way more challenging so I can go after this amazing opportunity? Is it insane to make this move and leave my support system behind and move to a place where I barely know anyone? And if I do do it, is it going to be hard to have a constant reminder of all of the plans and excitement that we talked about that literally got ripped out from under me. My heart is aching. I have to start making decisions soon because I was supposed to start the job at the end of April. Any advice is welcome :(\n\nTl;dr I need advice on wether I should move after a breakup.",

        "text": "TLDR: It's sad how perspective can be completely different between people in the same relationship.\n\nNow, hopefully this won't be deleted, because me and this woman were not in an official relationship, we were talking for a while and it would, if it was for me, become one. It is a thought that i would like to share though, for i think it's sad, unfair and very frustrating.\n\nSo, i'm M32 and i've met this woman online - even though i have some old school mind, this was an exception. We were chatting about literature, talking books, some philosophy, amazing conversations and i got her number. She lived around 400km from me, which is kinda far but not too far so it wouldn't be possible for us to meet, which seemed great for me. Anyway, we talked for months, and since we had this deep connection, we liked the same things, same books, we even had the same goals in life, i started, slowly, to get deeper into it, talking about meeting each other in real life (she was not fake, i know some people would first think about this possibility, but i made sure, we talked on video and all). Now, continuing, i started these conversations about meeting, and she would just give a smile emoji, like she's playing hard to get, which i didn't mind at first cause i do prefer she wouldn't be easy, but months like this started to make me frustrated. I had some deep feelings for her, even as a person, not only as a woman, she was very unique on her conversations, the way she spoke (audio and video) and wrote, that was my view of her, an incredible person that i thought with myself: even if we never date, i would like to keep in touch with her.\n\nAt some point i pressured her, told her i was going to her city to meet her and it was ok for her, and then for the first time ever she was honest with me, she said she liked someone else for all this time, and that she talked to me just to pass time, that it's weird that we've only met online, and that it couldn't possibly happen. Then i asked her if we should stop speaking then, and she said yes. I was absolutely crushed, and the reason is precisely this unbalance of perspective: i had a view that our conversations were amazing, that we had something special (even if not for relationship), some deep talks about life and death, dreams, things i very rarely find people to talk about in my routine, it was beautiful really. But her view of me was just some random guy who she was passing the time, and absolutely nothing more. I honestly couldn't think, based on our conversation, that this kind of manipulation would be done by her, or maybe i am just overreacting? It cant be it, i think, i'm not that young, i recognize things that are shallow and things that aren't, but now i feel not only as i'm worthless, but also a complete fool.",

        "text": "My boyfriend (we'll call him Jerry) and I have been together for almost 6 years, we've been living together for 4. Backstory: I had a difficult childhood and moved across the country at 18, whereas he has lived in the same city his entire life. I live in his hometown now, and we are very close to his family and friends. We have a great relationship, with good communication and the same passions/hobbies with similar life goals (so I thought). \n\nDuring the pandemic, our shared industry essentially shut down (we were both artists). We collectively decided to change careers, so I went back to school full time for an undergraduate degree and Jerry went to an expedited one year trade school. His new field is really hard to break into (sometimes guys can go 5 years without being hired) so he is still working his same 9-5 while he applies for jobs in his new field. I go to class full-time and work at a bar part-time to support myself, I work full-time in the summer. Because of this limbo, we are sort of stuck financially and this causes us a lot of stress, especially him. His friends are also all getting married, having children, going on expensive vacations, and he has a terrible habit of comparing his life to theirs and feeling down about himself.\n\nSo here's the main issue: throughout the course of our relationship, we have always struggled with serious talks about marriage. Jerry just sort of shuts down when I bring it up, which is weird because communication about everything else is great. He says that he does want to marry me and he wants a family with me, but he wants to buy a house first and invest money and make sure we're financially set before saving for it. Which I get, I know it's logical and I know that works for some people. Unfortunately, I'm a traditional romantic gal and I want a ring and a wedding. I also really want to be a mom, because my own family is quite broken and I want to build a new one here. We had a really big fight about it a year ago, and the conclusion was that he would propose when I am in my third year of school, we would marry when I graduate and we'd have kids a couple years after to give me time to settle into my new career before going on mat leave.\n\nI'm nearing the end of my second year and I've been dropping cheeky little hints here and there, just comments like \"this would be a gorgeous place to propose\" or \"look how clean this is, wouldn't I be the best wife?\" Each time he just smiles and clams up and won't engage. This past month, Jerry started talking about how he wants to buy a plot of land to hunt on or sink all his savings into starting a business. This is something we haven't talked about and obviously doesn't fit into our timeline of buying a house-getting married-having a family. When I confronted him about this and asked if he still plans to propose in the next year, he told me that he doesn't want to spend his money on a ring right now and thinking about paying for a wedding stresses him out. I told him I don't want a crazy expensive ring, but he said that if he's gonna do it, he's gonna \"do it right.\" I don't even want a big wedding! I reminded him of our timeline and he said he's not even sure if he wants kids anymore!! Apparently he doesn't want to be an \"old dad\" by having kids at 35. But I don't know what else he wants me to do, like do you want me to drop out of school to have kids now and then we'll just be broke? We live in a one room apartment.\n\nHe tells me that he loves me and he wants to marry me, but he's so focused on money whereas I just want to be his wife. It's so painful because I really love him and I thought we wanted the same things out of life, but I'm confused now. I'm so tired of fighting about it and pulling teeth just to get him to talk about it. I know he's stressed about money but I feel so insecure and like he's just with me because he's afraid of more change? I've told him this so many times but it just doesn't seem to land, he just says that he loves me and wants to be with me but he's scared of marriage and the future and money and being a failure etc. His stress seems to make him want to run, but I want to hold onto what I have.\n\nSo what do you think? Am I being impatient? Will he propose once we become more financially stable? Or is this incompatibility and I should find someone who will marry me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; My boyfriend is very stressed about money and hates talking about getting married. But we've been together for 6 years and I don't want to be a girlfriend for much longer. Do I hold out for happier days or do I look for greener grass?",
