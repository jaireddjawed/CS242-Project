A guy buzzed me in but when I got to the door it opened and this cut little Asian woman poked her head from around the door. I realized she wasn't dressed but as I tried to give her the box she opened the door all the way. All she had on was small pair of panties. She was gorgeous, golden skin, long black hair, small but very nice boobs. She was a bit nervous and giddy but didn't cover up and let me take a good look as she paid me. This job has some perks.",

        "text": "So I worked in the pizza bizz for 6 years. I started as a driver and worked up to GM. I have a ton of stories from the road and from my time inside. I figured it was time to start sharing them. So here's one.\n\nWhen I first started, I worked at a store that was pretty dang sketchy. We had a LOT of robberies (I was held up at gun point for $12 order), driver assaults, a couple car jackings, hell one of the drivers (a 58 y/o woman) was shot in the stomach and almost died.\n\nSo I get a run going to a dead end street. It's late afternoon, so still some light. This order was just under $80 and a new customer, so I was automatically on edge. I cruise my way down the street, checking for the address, and finally see it. No cars outside, no visible lights, and a group of six guys playing basket ball are across the street in the driveway; I just KNOW I'm about to get jacked.\n\nI stash my wallet and phone under the seat. Get the food and walk up to the door. All the while I noticed that the guys playing ball have stopped, and are now staring at me. I get to the door, and knock..... knock..... knock.... KNOCK. OH god, there's no one inside, it's a fake order, they're about to come jump me.... aaahhhhhh\n\nAnd the door opened! Nice lady took the food, gave me four twenties and closed the door. I spun around, all saw the group still looking at me.\n\nOkay, they didn't jack me for the food but now I have $80+ on me AND THEY KNOW IT. Ah shit.... So I hustle back to the car, jump in, throw it in reverse, and cut the wheel pulling out. ::THUNK: I cut the wheel too hard, and went front end into the ditch. I couldn't believe it. In my haste to escape, I have now stranded myself.\n\nI began trying to figure out what to do. Call the store, see if someone can pull me out? Get a tow truck? Then it happened. I saw shadows. The group of men descended on my car. Three on each side. They had surrounded the doors, one was shouting something to the three on the other side. and then.... they lifted. They lifted the front end of my car out of the ditch and got me back onto the road. My face turned cherry red.\n\nI got out, and thanks them a million times. They chuckled, told me to be safe, and went back to their yard. I felt like a complete ass for suspecting them of nefarious intent. I got back to the store and mentioned nothing.\n\nSo there ya'll go, hope someone enjoyed. If so I'll post more. Have a good one everyone!\n\ntldr: Stuck my car in a ditch trying to get away from presumed robbers, who then lifted my car out of said ditch.",

        "text": "Chinese food. \n\nI worked at a Chinese restaurant in an East Texas town... we served both good neighborhoods and bad; some tipped well and some didn't. Most of the drivers would answer the phone and make a determination based on whether they wanted to take the delivery, or vehemently deny it. This was mostly based on stupid things like, neighborhood, voice, \"ghetto\", or any other number of stupid excuses. \n\nI didn't mind taking any delivery, as it got me out of the restaurant and into my sweet car, tips were just an added benefit.\n\nOne time one of my colleagues a phone call from a gentleman who he described as, \"hood.\" The order was like $38 but, my colleague did not want to take it. This guy would refuse to deliver to certain apartment complexes, neighborhoods, etc. so, I wasn't really surprised. \n\nWhen I got the hotel, I went up to the room and brought the food. The customer gave me a $100, to which I apologized for not having change. I offered to go down to the front desk and break it because we only carried change up to the next $20. The guy looks back at me and says, \"Nah bruh, you look like you need a break... that's all for you.\" \n\nI continued to be the driver customers would ask for. There were many \"regulars\" who would ask about my car, family, etc. They'd sometimes even ask me to bring the food to the dining room table and have the maid tip me a $20. I learned a lot about how to treat people from that job. It also made me a lot more patient with colleagues and clients alike. \n\nEdit: Forgot to add that the guy with the \"hood\" voice at the hotel happened to be a rapper in town for a show. ",

        "text": "Ok, full disclosure, this did happen to me, years ago, but this isn't about my story. This is about another driver getting stuck in a ditch and how management was going to handle the situation.\n\nSo this past Friday, during the dinner rush, our main opening driver's name on the dispatch screen was in the \"Off the Road\" status^1. I was curious as to why he was in that status so I went back to ask him, I assumed he was off the road because he was behind on doing prep, but I could not find him. I dismissed my concerns and went on my next set of deliveries.\n\nWhen I came back to the store I noticed that the opening driver's vehicle was not in the parking lot, but he was still logged on in the \"Off the Road\" status. I looked for him again but still could not find him. I asked my manager^2 \"Hey! Where's Opening Driver?\"\n\n*Manager*: \"Ohh, he got his car stuck in a ditch.\"\n\n**Me**: \"He got his truck stuck in a ditch? That's fucking hilarious. I mean that sucks. Does he know when he'll be back?\"\n\n*Manager*: \"He said he's getting some help and then he'll be right back. I'll edit his time after he logs out.\"\n\n**Me**: \"Uhmm, what the fuck do you mean by 'I'll edit his time'?\n\n*Manager*: \"Ohh, well I'll deduct the time he's been waiting to get his truck out of the ditch.\"\n\n**Me**: \"**No, you won't.**\"\n\n*Manager*: \"What do you mean? Of course I'm going to deduct that time, he's not working.\"\n\n**Me** &lt;getting a bit riled up&gt;: \"That is absofuckinglutely time that you will be paying him. Don't you fucking dare deduct any time off his time clock.\"\n\n*Manager*: \"What are you getting mad about? He's ok with it.\"\n\n**Me**: \"I don't care if he's ok with it. That time he's spent waiting to get his truck out of the ditch is time worked, and you will pay him for that time if I have anything to say about it, and I do have something to say about it.\"\n\n*Manager*: \"Well, I've always been told to log out drivers in this situation.\"\n\n**Me**: \"Whoever told you that is fucking wrong.\"\n\n*Manager*: \"All the managers I've worked for have told me to do this. The Area Manager has told me to do this.\"\n\n**Me**: That does not surprise me, and those people are fucking wrong.\"\n\n*Manager*: \"We'll I'll call the Area Manager and ask him.\"\n\n**Me**: \"That sounds like a great idea. And if they tell you that you should deduct the time, they are fucking wrong and I will suggest to Opening Driver that he file charges against this company with DOL.\"\n\n*Manager*: \"Wow, are you serious?\"\n\n**Me**: \"Yes. I know I joke around a lot, but this is a serious issue and you KNOW I know my labor law. Go make your call.\"\n\nManager heads to her office. I go about my business cutting pizzas. This conversation took about a minute, all the while I was working the cut table during the dinner rush.\n\nA few minutes later Manager comes back and tells me: \n\nAccording to my Manager, the Area Manager initially said that the driver should be logged out. Then Manager told him that I said that was wrong. The Area Manager said he was standing next to the Director of Operations and that he'd ask him. The Director of Operations agreed that I was correct and that the driver should stay logged on.\n\nI talked to my Manager a bit more about why the driver is expected to stay logged on so she'd better understand and be able to apply this lesson in the future, so she wouldn't violate any others employee's rights.\n\n___\n^1: For those that are not familiar with Papa John's our drivers can be taken off the road so they are no longer in the driver queue, but are still logged on as drivers. This is likely due to needing a way to address \"Split Pay\", but that's another discussion. One I am willing to have if anyone wants to ask questions.\n\n^2: This was her second day as a General Manager. I've known her for close to 3 years (I think), I like her as a person and co-worker, we give each other a hard time (we've actually hung out a few times outside of work before she became our manager, shame she went and became the enemy... LOL) So don't automatically think that I am treating her any differently because she's a woman. This is how we talk to each other, and we're both ok with it. If you don't like it you can go fuck yourself. :)",

        "text": "So I took up pizza delivery as a summer job to help pay for college and this was during my first summer on the job. As a newbie, I didn't really notice many of the regulars. After maybe a month in I realized that I would get orders from this same guy a lot. He would always order two medium pizzas(toppings differed a bit, but was always 2 mediums). The guy always paid in cash and always tipped pretty decently, which isn't really that weird cause it was a nice neighborhood. What was weird, though, is the fact that this guy had BEES.\n\nThe front door to his house had a tall arch around it and at the very top of that was a giant cluster of bees. During my first delivery there I noped the hell out of there as quickly as possible after hastily getting the guy his pizza. I never got to ask the guy about it because every delivery lasted maybe 2 seconds. I'd ring the doorbell and step back a few feet away from the bees. He would open the door just a crack, we'd exchange pizza/money and then the door would immediately shut.\n\nAfter delivering to that guy's place a few times, I was surprised I never got stung. Honestly, the bees there were kinda bros, they just kinda floated down to inspect me and moved on. I was initially scared of delivering there, but after the second time of not being stung I was kinda excited to be able to go see the bro bees.\n\nTL;DR Customer had a giant cluster of bees in the arch above his doorway. Learned that bees can be total bros after delivering there a few times.",

Maybe a couple times per month? \nWhen I deliver to the hotel, I just walk in, and then right to the room. I'll say hello and acknowledge the employee at the front desk as I walk past.\n\nI recently spent a few nights at a higher end Westin Hotel  in Jersey City, NJ.  While there, on several occasions I noticed delivery driver's arrive.  They'd take the pizza to the concierge, and he would then take the food to the room.  You had to have a room key to gain entry to the elevators and room floors, and there was a sign saying all deliveries to guests had to go through the concierge.\n\nThis got my thinking. How does the delivery driver get paid and then get their tips at these kind of hotels?\n\nAre there any delivery drivers here who deliver to higher end hotels that prevent just anybody from accessing the room floors?  If so, how does this kind of situation work? What if the customer places an online order to be paid in cash?  If they pay by credit card, how do you get your tip?  Do you just get screwed in these kind if situations? What if it's a cash order, and you can't reach the customer by phone and the hotel won't let you up to the rooms?\n\nAlso, do you guys ever have problems pulling up to the front door at a hotel, and then having the bell hops giving you a hard time trying to tell you that you can't park and leave your car there when there's nowhere else to park?\n\nI have 17 years experience in this job, but with hotel deliveries, I have minimal experience.\n\nCurious to get some feedback into how these deliveries work?\n\n\n",

I say residential because we deliver to a pretty popular Florida island beach, so there's not much you can do about shitty customers out there since they are constantly changing. I've \"blacked out\" three customers since I've worked here. One for constantly giving me HIS address, but he would be at his neighbors (two houses down), supposedly watching for me, but not answering his phone when I called. Another for making me wait 15 minutes because their 12-14 year old daughter said they 'went to the store' but when they got back, they were all pilled out, card carrying pharmy army members, who kept showing me all the stacks of 100s in their pocket but paying me their $17.53 bill in exact change. And another who wouldn't answer their door because they thought I was a cop, they wouldn't turn their porch light on and I was holding my pen-light to maneuver around their trashy porch, all the while I could hear them saying, \"It looks like a cop, don't answer it.\", even though I keep saying \"it's your delivery driver!\" after trying to call them a thousand times and waiting 15 minutes outside, my manager calls me and says they called him asking where I was, I told him I was there and what happened, he called them back and they said that if I was faster I'd make better tips, their total was $16.91... they gave me $17.

The order was a new customer, and lots of food. The street was poorly lit with those stupid amber street lights that don't have much lumens. If you are in the biz, you know dark areas, late at night, are our bane. If you fire up your flashlight torch, you're going to draw attention to yourself that you don't belong there and you're lost. Gps isn't giving you correct directions directly to the correct address, so you're driving down the street shining a bright ass light on buildings. 2-3 addresses before you get to the correct one, there are 3 (black) guys trying to flag you down and saying, \"yo yo yo!\"\n\nYou get to where the gps says it is and the numbers aren't matching. There is trash (litter and garbage) lining the curbside, all down the street as you drive. \n\nYou pull into the parking area where the gps says you're there, but the numbers being illuminated by your headlights aren't matching where you need to be. You look down the street and the 3 guys are walking towards your car.\n\nIt was then that I decided it was unsafe to continue looking or get out of the car. I pulled a u turn and left. Passing by the 3 guys. I didn't speed. They were still trying to wave me down as I passed the second time. I got a quarter mile away and called my store to tell them about it and I felt unsafe getting out of the car. They said okay and that they would call the customer.\n\nMy spidey sense has protected me well over the decades. The costumer was pissed and said I should have called them. In that neighborhood, it would have taken them up to 5 minutes for them to come outside after asking them to. They take their sweet ass time.  By that time, I would have not had the advantage of being able to leave before they reached my location on foot. \n\nDon't get pissed at me, get pissed at the assholes that are up to no good, late at night, hanging out on the street, and trying to flag down passing cars. Go bitch them out that your family is going to bed hungry because you scared the delivery guy off!",

For fun, I tracked my orders, the total, tip, miles from the store, race, and the \"location.\" \n\nOverall my average tip has been a consistent 5.00, while some days I get two jerks who tip 1.50, or the college bro who drops 10 on me like no tomorrow (god bless)\n\nI had three deliveries in the car, one prepped (5.00), one cash order and one gift card order, where the tip was the left over cash (about 1.50). \n\nI do my orders, no problem and come up to an apartment complex that I've delivered to so many times that the security guard lets me in without even asking (again, god bless). \n\nSo with like 13 pizzas in my car, I pull out this order. 112, no drinks, just a pizza. For some reason I feel the need to bring the receipt. \n\nI get to this door and knock, prep the pizza in the hotbag-- ready to pull it out whenever they open up.  Lady opens up, her apartments kinda lacking in furniture and it's a tad messy. Who's judging though, I'm just as bad.

Well that sucks.**\n\nSo she scrambles, again, for the loose c hange in her purse. She manages to turn 16.00 into 19.00 with extra metal, and at that point I tell her, \"it's fine, I've 50 cents in my car, I'll cover it.\"\n\n**So I ended up getting a delivery where her .50 tip ended up being -.50 because she didn't read the website correctly.\n**\n\nTo offset it, the pre-tip of 1.50 gave me 4 in cash on top of it.

I've slipped once seriously on a sidewalk and gone on plenty of treacherous ones.\n\nI can go to Walmart and pickup a bunch of salt / melting stuff to clear up ice. Obviously it doesn't work instantly, but I could put some of that down on sidewalks as I go and see icy spots.\n\nIs that reasonable? I feel like, if I have to walk on the route, it's reasonable to expect it to not be icy. On the other hand, I can see quite easily objections about \"what? you can't just go around dropping these chemicals on someone's property!\"\n\n---\n\nI know plenty of managers and drivers at my store advocate, at least in questionable circumstances, not going up but requiring the customer to meet the driver at the vehicle. Personally, I consider my job to get the order to the customer's door. The last part of that is a walking delivery (and for very small part of our range around our store, basically one apartment building, I actually do a completely walking delivery).\n\nOn that route, actually, there's a more innocuous version of this. Today I \"re-blazed\" the 'trail' of packed snow along one section connecting two parking lots, the only uncleared / unmaintained part of walking there. It was probably 18 inches of powder, which was impressive but slightly irritating.\n\nAnd there's actually areas of those parking lots where there's some ice that could be usefully melted.\n\nI wonder if I can find some sort of ice melting thing that's actually innocuous enough for a residential walkway.\n\nOf course, there's always the approach of asking the customer, but I like to keep the delivery as simple as possible. And I'm a fan of \"easier to ask forgiveness than permission\" where reasonable.\n\n---\n\nFor the spot where I fell, I think it would be perfectly reasonable to put down some salt. It's a sidewalk at a local motel. It's not salted just because no one's paying that much attention to it and I and other drivers from my store do deliveries there pretty regularly, not to mention it being in the residents' best interests to have ice-free sidewalks.\n\n---\n\nTotally crazy?

        "text": "I've never had a problem with cashout before. But tonight, something must have gone very wrong. I didn't notice it at first: $65 cashout, well, okay, but I really thought I'd done better than that. If it was a lot lower, or negative, I would have caught it right away.\n\nBut I'd had a busy 8 hours. I did 20 deliveries. I think two stiffed me and one gave a $1 tip. The two highest were a $20 and a $10 tip, both on credit card. The mileage reimbursement for those deliveries came out to $24. If you're following along at home, that makes for (24 + 20 + 10 + 15*2) 84 as a minimum estimate of how much I should have cashed out with tonight.\n\nNow I watched the cash count and the credit card receipts being entered as I usually do. Everything looked right to me. And when I was asked \"okay?\" at $65, I'm sure I was \"alright, sure, sounds good\" after a slight hesitation where I thought it seemed low, but eh, $65 isn't a great night considering the 8 hours and 20 deliveries but it beats $0. \n\nBut given what I recall when considering all of the deliveries (i.e.: the minimum estimate of $2 tip on the other 15 'anonymous' deliveries, excluding 2 stiffs and a $1 and the $20 and the $10), and the baseline of those two (easily verifiable) $20 and $10 credit card tips, and the mileage for the 20 deliveries (I hadn't recalled myself, but screen showed that as total, so the $65 should include that $24 correctly already.).$65 just can't be right.\n\nI believe there are two possibilities. If there are more, I have not noticed the others. The first is that I lost the money at some point. This is a perfectly logical and reasonable possibility. It concerns me. I would like to be able to rule it out. The second is that the order I took which was supposedly  (according to the coworker I would say I trust the most out of any of them, at least previously, now that I suspect this second possibility) \"zeroed out\" was not, in fact zeroed out. It was, in fact, run through at full price, a bit under $40. Which would just about line up with having made it a great night rather than a mediocre one (again, factoring in length of shift).\n\nSo...it'll be interesting to see. I'm going to wait until tomorrow to check further, because I don't want to do something like this over the phone, just as a personal bias (want to be able to find a good time to check on it rather than just 'barging in' on the phone; also, plan on / am getting stoned and relaxing after work rather than trying to follow up immediately. If it was the cash count, it would already be too late. If it was the credit card receipts, I'd call up tonight to make sure whatever it is gets checked yet tonight. But with the question of it being zeroed out or not, I believe that should remain to the next day in the computer in a way accessible to a manager to check, and I'd rather be able to see the answer in person.\n\nThere's a strong argument here that I was negligent to accept the initial cashout of $65 without having done the full math myself. And that to make it easier I should go in tonight to make sure to straighten it out properly rather than waiting until tomorrow.\n\nBut I'm *off* now. I did my work. I got paid. If I should've been paid more, then I'm annoyed. If I lost money, then I'm annoyed. I don't know yet where the error was, myself or my coworker, but I lost money, at least temporarily, and that's frustrating. Something went wrong.\n\n---\n\nIt was still a good day though. I was playing catch-up for like the first two and a half hours or so: every order I was taking was just like crazy far behind already. I wasn't used to day shift. I don't know if they're usually that behind/short-staffed or what, but it would explain a lot. I know they've been getting pressure on labor numbers and in my opinion it leads to some poor choices at times (although I judge it wrong myself constantly; tonight I was tired so looking to see if I could go home early when there was a lull, but nope, then manager's not interested in saving labor hours. Was a good choice for the delivery times and my pay; I just was ready to be done once the sun went down; which is weird, given that I normally start then).\n\nAnyhow, customers weren't too annoyed. People generally seem to cut us a lot of slack. There are the customers that complain, but as a driver it's easy: they want to speak to a manager? Great! Hold. Inform manager. No longer your problem. [This works as long as the source of the original problem is not you (still works if your manager doesn't care) ; otherwise it may still end up being your problem again. Still, not your problem *right now*, which is enough time to find a delivery to take...] (edit: obviously, with delivery, a customer that wants to spea\n\nI did get lower tips during the start. I figured it was because were running late. But tips were generally modest all ~~night~~day. I just did a ton of deliveries. Got a lot of fast doubles: my first 6 deliveries were all doubles, and done in about an hour and a half. Given that doubles are the maximum we ever run, and that I normally get about 2 deliveries an hour on average during a median shift or so, from a driver's perspective the runs went well.\n\nI also got a late double up to some nice apartments on the Mesa where the total tipped was about $10. It was at the point of the night where I saw the orders, didn't bother checking in with the manager about \"can I go home?\": nope, clearly this double needs to be done, no other drivers in, don't know when the next driver gets back (even though likely not too long given number of drivers and times, still, waiting pizza).\n\nHopefully the \"zeroed out\" order wasn't actually and will be tomorrow and I get a nice bonus, rightfully earned. It happened once before, and I didn't even catch it: from 1/1 there was a $15 order apparently that hadn't gotten \"bad ordered\" and so I'd cashed out under without noticing it (by the time I got it, I didn't remember the circumstances of it, but as a result a bad order not actually getting bad ordered has sort of stuck with me)\n\nBut I trusted her when she said it was already zeroed out. Either I'm out some cash I lost on the ground, or her statement was incorrect. I don't really like either option, although I'll certainly take the cash if she made a mistake and it wasn't voided. [Edit: I think I figured it out. First, I don't have the delivery tag, which is a problem. She didn't give me one (she threw it out; uh, what? thanks for nothing...). But I do have the directions in my book which I printed up for it and I know the address. I can't swear to what was on the box labels, having been told \"voided\" all I was thinking was \"$0.00\" transaction which they normally print up and generally means stiff (I actually got tipped on this delivery, one of the memorable things about it, given it was \"free\"). But what she printed up was a receipt showing that a credit card payment was voided. Now, perhaps she then correctly set the order price to zero. But if she accidentally set it to cash later instead...ooops, $37 deduction from my pay. And I have *zero* visibility on that most critical part, because she didn't give me a delivery tag for it. Lesson learned. Don't take a delivery without a tag from anyone (if at all possible). I'll bring it up with her (politely and calmly) tomorrow if she's on (usually is), otherwise whatever manager is there.]\n\nThe deliveries all went fine though. Places I recognized or at least neighborhoods I knew, for the most part. I don't think there are too many corners of this town yet I haven't delivered to, which is helpful. I know there still are plenty of additional places to learn, in particular in more detail, but in general the navigating is way easier for me now. We had some light snow and generally warm (near freezing) weather. Supposedly next week is going to be \"cold\" by local radio standards at ~20 degrees Fahrenheit. Laughable by Minnesota \"cold\" standards. :-)\n\n---\n\nToday was good. Tomorrow should be better.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Update, not worthy of a second post, in particular given the hatred of this one: the transaction was, as I had guessed ultimately here, voided for the card transaction, but then placed as cash later and not zeroed out. So I had been shorted $47. I got that today, although it would have been better it turns out if I'd gone in yet yesterday before the books were closed. I'll make sure to call it earlier if it happens again. The coworker/manager apologized sincerely, which I appreciated, and the GM took care of getting me reimbursed.\n\nWith that addition, yesterday (the day of this story), was one of my best days, and today was pretty average. But, I actually got it today, so based on actual cashouts, today is now my high score. Go me! :-) And three days off now, with a good five days of shifts scheduled after.",

When the customer bellows \"do I have do I have to sign something? Meaning they either didn't plan to tip or just want to sign and return.

I see 3 little black kids running up and down the walls literally jumping on the bed in this trashed room. The mom hears the noise and steps out with her bathrobe to greet me. She sounded like she just got punched in the chest. She asks the total and when I tell her I saw her heart drop in her eyes. This is when I knew ny fate was sealed. How do you not know how much you bought? I think to myself. She gives me 25$ cash and says hold on. The mom settles her kids down and says \"alright kids, let's find mommy $7.xx  so she can buy the pizza!\" The hunt begins, I stand there as these kids and mom literally trash the room even more, finding spare dollars, quarters, and ect. 3 minutes later the mom opens a drawer and I see it scattered with change. They all run to it and grab it all amd count it out. They found about $1 or so less than the total was but i said I'd take of it. Wouldn't want to see their search not be rewarded in pizza.

I spoke with the employer today and had a very frank discussion about what happened. The employer assured me that this issue is very serious as he was using work resources (publicly funded) to harass me. While technically the conduct leading up to the prank order ($366) was off duty, it was the context of which lead up to the prank order so his employer asked me more about it. The guy on the phone was taking notes as I spoke. \n\nHis employer informed me to be aware that they are going to have to \"take him in and address this very serious issue\" and that my information aside from my name will be protected. His employer also told me that if C comes into my establishment again and gives me a hard time to immediately call the police and to call them and let them know. He apologized profusely on C's behalf (oh the irony), and described his behavior as \"childish\" and \"ridiculous\". \n\nI explained to him that C has made up conspiracy theories about why I personally would place the prank order. His employer is aware that our system tracks orders and that the prank order was the first one under that phone number. There is no way I would have that information to \"frame him\" and I can prove it if need be. I also informed him that C has made it his personal mission to have me fired, which he will probably bring up and say that I am seeking vengeance for his videotaping of me. \n\nThat being said, my job is very safe. My boss and the three bosses above him know about the situation and have my back. I have been with my company for 9 years and can provide telephone numbers of corporate employees who will vouch for that. His boss is well aware that my job is safe and this isn't me desperately trying to keep my job. In fact, I told his boss about that video that C keeps saying he has but hasn't shown to anyone yet. C's boss knows that this is probably because it is on his work phone and is going to look into that...\n\n\nMy how the tables have turned. \n\nIt isn't my intention to get C fired or arrested. My intention is to let him know that the rules apply to him too. He probably won't get fired because he is union, but he is for sure going to get a stern warning and told not to come back. I doubt he will call in again because he more than likely needs his job and could be arrested if he enters the building again. Being arrested could affect his employment.\n\n\n",

Rang and rang and rang and rang. I was out there for about 10 minutes before I just said fuck it and drove back to the shop with their order.\n\nWe got a call from them about 25 minutes later wondering \"Where the fuck is our order?\" We informed them that the order had come, the driver had called 5 times and then left.\n\nTheir reason for not picking up was that \"The caller ID didn't say ******* Pizza!\" as if my cell phone is going to have that as the name. I know my phone doesn't have a name registered, it only shows the number when I call. So they knew that the driver was supposed to call, they saw a local number call 5 times about 20 minutes after they ordered a pizza, but they didn't think to pick it up.\n\nI wasn't asked to drive it out the second time.\n\nSometimes I fucking hate people.",

We're located in a pretty small town, so there usually isn't a large amount of delivering to do. Because most of us want to stay useful, most drivers know how to run everything store side.\n\nI was up front running the register and this fella comes in, pays for his order (around $13 or so) with a card. He asks me \"Hey, how many people are working here tonight?\" It's a bit odd but I don't think much of it, I tell him there's four of us here tonight. He writes $20 down in the tip box and tells me to give everyone $5, Merry Christmas.\n\nI stutter a bit and start pouring on the thanks. As he's walking out the door I tell him he can take a drink if he wants (we have a cooler right out front) but he declines and goes on his way, like any good hero. I hand everyone their tip and we all wave at him as he leaves. It made my night.",

        "text": "There's a new prompt-care type medical place by the shop. This guy has ordered a few times, big orders, for all the staff. He's a drug rep so I assume he's doing it to get on their good graces. The orders are typically 100-150$. I've delivered four of these type of orders, have been stiffed every time.\n\nSee the address pop up this Tuesday. Whatever, I had mentally accepted my fate already. I show up, no one has any idea where the pizzas are going. No one has any idea who even ordered them. I ask the receptionist where the pizzas are going and receive a rude \"how should I know?\" in response. I'm standing there with my thumb up my ass as she goes back to typing on her computer. Literally standing in the lobby with three bags full of pizza, with the staff staring at me but not helping.\n\nI make the universal face for \"would someone please help me\"  and a nurse comes out to talk to me. Says the drug rep ordered them, and he should be back soon, so she lets me in the back to put them in the waiting room.\n\n10 minutes go by. I go out to ask if the guy will be back soon to sign for his order. 20 minutes go by, I go out to ask again and am again given the answer \"he'll be here soon\", this time with a bit of hostility like Im bothering them. \n\nJust to say, too, I would have just left the order usually since it was a CC - but no one had any idea what was going on. Also it was an expensive order. I wasnt even sure if they HAD ordered pizza. I didnt want to be responsible for something being wrong on a huge order.\n\nAnyway - I call the guy (phone # on receipt), and ask him whats going on. He instantly says I WILL BE THERE SOON, JUST LEAVE THE ORDER. I hear an audible sigh, like again, I am annoying them. Whatever, I leave the food. No tip (obviously). I HAVE to have SOMEONE sign the receipt, but none of the nurses will sign it since \"they dont feel comfortable.\". Fuck it. I write an X on it, leave the food, and leave.\n\nFour hours later this motherfucker comes into the store saying about how \"I made him look bad\" because I was \"rude, stomping around, yelling about having to wait.\" He also filed a complaint with the area coach. I am very mad.\n\n\nAm I in the wrong here? For starters, if you order $120 worth of food you shold be there to pick it up right? OR AT LEAST tell the staff that you ordered! Also I am losing time and money having to wait around for this guy, for 30 minutes in total! Im losing deliveries, Im losing MONEY. Plus this guy does NOT tip, ever. \n\nI know theres nothing I can do about it I guess, but I needed to vent. It's bad enough not getting a tip on such a big order and being treated so rude, but its just salt in the wound that this guy would complain about ME being rude. I WAS PATIENT!! MORE THAN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN! I mean not only did this guy stiff, make me wait 30 minutes....but he tries to get me in trouble! Luckily my co workers like me and (Id like to think) know I am not a rude person and I would never do what he accused me of. But man I'm mad. \n\ntldr - guy made me wait 30 minutes, was unbelievably rude, accused me indirectly of being racist, did not tip on four $100+ orders, tried to get me in trouble with boss",

        "text": "This is a strange post, as there is a story, but I also am looking for some guidance. I'll start with the story. (tl:dr at the bottom of the post)\n\nOver the summer, one of the managers at our store (Let's call him A) was working another job and was not scheduled to work. He is close friends with the GM, and recently started closing the store 2 days a week, and driving another. A is lazy. Although he works hard, it is only in spurts, and is never consistent. He expects the store to run itself, and for him to never be needed. He usually sits in the back of the store on his phone the whole time. Unfortunately, I am usually the closing driver with A, and although him and I get along, I absolutely hate working with him, as the work environment becomes awful (And quiet) when he is working. Yesterday took the cake, though. \n\nI've worked through it all, the carry out apocalypse, being the only driver on a busy Saturday night, AC Failures, cleaning the store 2 hours after you're scheduled off because the owners are coming in the next day (Spoiler Alert, they didn't) but I have never dealt with what happened yesterday. \n\nBeing around the holidays, we are a little short on staff. We just lost one of our drivers, and another is on vacation. Tuesdays have been kinda busy recently, but our GM has been scheduling us like they aren't. That means one opening driver, and two drivers for the evening, with one staying to close. Unfortunately this day was a busy day, and even more unfortunate is the weird bug going around the store. I had it, the next day another driver had it, and by the third day, my girlfriend (A CSR) and A had it. Stomach bugs are not fun, and hell to work on, but A decided it would be a good idea to come into work anyway (He really shouldn't have, I know). What did he come into work to do? Sit in the back, on his phone, not talking to anyone, not helping with anything, and then fucked off to his car for a few hours leaving our cook, G, another manager(On as a driver) R, and myself. \n\n\nIt was busy for 3 people in the store. Pizzas were getting backed up out of the oven, phones were ringing 3 at a time, and R and I were out on deliveries for a good portion of that. It got to the point where dishes were piling up, pizzas were coming out, and I had to let deliveries sit in bags for way too long, just so I could help inside the store and still make on-time. R was supposed to be off at 8. By 8:30, there were too many deliveries, no one had done a single dish, G was straight slaying dragons, no chaser and kept the whole ship afloat (He is a manager transfer from another store) And R agreed to cover for A to close the store. It was not a great situation leading up to this. As a closing driver for A, it was up to me to do a lot of shit on top of just dishes, driving, and moping. Do the fryer, clean it to A's standards (He may be correct about how to do it, but he wants it too good some times) This was all weiging heavily on my shoulders as the night was ticking on. I have never been so close to walking out of a job in my life. Luckily, as soon as A left, everything miraculously got done. I'm out on a double, and come back to most of the dishes being done. Take a few phone calls, a few more deliveries, and we are out of the store when we are scheduled to. We still had to bust our asses to make up for lost time, but it all worked out. \n\n**TL:DR**\n\nI love working at my store, to the point where I was feeling guilty looking for jobs elsewhere for hours tonight. Before last night, I never dreaded going into work. You know that sick, sinking feeling in your stomach when you have to do something you don't want to do, and all you want to do is sit at home and cry, or hide? That happened every time I thought of work ever sense yesterday. Today the cold killed my old car battery and I couldn't go in, which was a relief, but you can't run forever. \n\n\nA is planning on becoming a GM at another local store (He really shouldn't be allowed to do it, but I just want him out of my hair) so he will be gone \"Soon\" but I honestly don't know how many more shifts I can do with him. I'm finding it hard to leave the store considering I'm really connected to the store and most of the people working here. Overall, I'm kinda stuck, and need some outside perspective. If anything, thanks for reading. ",

        "text": "I've delivered to a lot of drunks. At this point, it makes me slightly nervous, in a similar way to delivering when children respond at the door: if they do something wrong, it's impossible to argue against them. Never really had anything go wrong with drunks so far, but I'm always a bit more on edge.\n\nSo I delivered to an expensive local hotel. Visibly intoxicated, minimally clothed man answers the door. I provide him his order, including noting we'd done his special request 10 pepperoni on the side (wtf?). I give him the total, $39.XX. He starts digging through his wallet, gets a crumpled twenty, another, a ten, I'm waiting for him to hand it to me. He does, I thank him and put it in my pocket after confirming two twenties and a ten, and the crumpled bill falls out. He hand it to me, I thank him, deliver food and go back to store.\n\nSo I got three twenties and a ten on a forty dollar order. Am I a jerk? Should I have asked for confirmation? If the customer were sober, I would have been more likely to confirm, but as it was, I didn't really want to argue if he wants to give me a second extra bill. I counted it as \"voluntary drunk surcharge\" personally for tip category.\n\nHelped make for one of my best nights, on top of otherwise consistent and good tips (with minor exceptions). But I'm wondering about the morality of it. One of our drivers likes to complain loudly about large tips from drunks, and I'd always had the attitude \"just shut up and take it\" personally. But I never really hit it as large as here. If it were significantly more than that, I *would* have confirmed with customer regardless: \"hey, I appreciate it, but are you sure?\". But at $30 tip on $40 order it seemed just within the bounds of reasonability to me. Of course, I'm rather clearly biased on the topic.\n\nI'm curious on the thoughts of other drivers and how you've handled situations with drunk customers tipping you large amounts.\n\nEdit: Not particularly clear in the original write-up, but the customer was taking a while with selecting the bills. I was just waiting and giving customer time as usual, trying not to observe, but it was my impression in this situation that, although drunk, he did deliberately choose to take out *three* twenties and a ten, and that it was not accidentally pulling out an extra twenty in between the intended two and the ten.",

        "text": "As mentioned before I do sandwich delivery via bike. \n\nThe policy for my store is that if a customer doesn't show up to collect their food when we deliver within 5 minutes we can return to the store after calling and leaving a message stating why we left- usually I call the number on the receipt when I arrive to say I'm there, wait about 3 minutes, call again to see if I can reach them if they didn't answer the first time or if they got delayed if they did answer and said they were on their way (Since a lot of my deliveries are to upper end law and investment firms, and one of our most common delivery locations is the Cities police HQ wandering around looking for a person is out of the question) at the 4 minute mark I call and let them know I will be leaving in one minute to return to the store with their order and they can pick it up if they come down to the store in person.\n\nToday was something of an exception to that, I'd been doing well. I started they day off the day delivering two catering orders, annoying to do because trying to balance a bag full of sandwich party trays on one arm while pedaling a bike requires a bit of finesse but the holiday spirit seemed to be lingering and the first order tiped $20 on a $100 order and the second dropped $10 on a $40. By the time I got to the end of my shift I was feeling content with myself and a good days work and then I got sent to the hospital.\n\nI have nothing against the hospital, I really don't, but I wish they would stop sending me to it for other peoples sake. The first delivery I ever had there the surgeon I delivered to had a nurse pick up the order because he was called in for an emergency surgery. Today followed suit- I was delivering to a nurse in the Mobile intermediate surgery unit, always fun to track down a single nurse when they didn't even give us a last name on the order or even tell me which floor I was supposed to find them on.\n\nAfter a few moments of hunting I find the right floor, get directed to the right desk, and all hell breaks loose as alarms start going off in a room down the hall. the nurse station empties out and I'm left standing there with a bag full of food wondering what I'm going to do. Finally a new nurse shows up ask who I'm looking for and I give the name on the order form and she apologizes for the wait.\n\n&gt; Me: No problem. Your job takes priority over mine any day, if I was in there I wouldn't want you abandoning me to get your lunch.\n\nProbably a bit more honesty than necessary but really? I don't mind if admitting I'm not 100% charitable makes people like me less, I'm not a saint and don't want people thinking I am one. Alarms stop beeping and the Nurses finally come back out and my customers stops at the counter.\n\n&gt; Nurse: Thanks for waiting so long I know you guys try to be fast about things. He just got transferred from ICU this morning and we all go into panic mode when patients like that have heart attacks.\n\n&gt; Me: Not a problem. You guys do good work here, my assistant manager got discharged last week after he got hit by a driver running a red light. Far as I'm concerned you can take all the time in the world to deal with your patients while I wait.\n\nDidn't even realize till I got back to the shop that the nurse had put down a $5 tip for an order that only cost her $6.90 to start. Still I think I may see about getting other people to take hospital runs from now on, while I don't mind the staff between an emergency surgery, a heart attack, and the run before this where someone suddenly found themselves in need of an MRI right as I was about to deliver to the radiologist I think I should probably hold off before I kill someone because a doctor was hungry.",

        "text": "Before I start this story I feel the need to admit something. I know /u/redditcoruum. She and I work together in the same Papa John's franchise, at different locations. She warned me that I probably should not admit to knowing her, since it might cause a good number of you to disbelieve what I am about to say. Everything I am about to say is true. I did do this. I am still employed. I plan on remaining employed for many years to come.\n\nI would also like to thank /u/redditcoruum for taking the time to assist me in formatting and editing this story. Without her help this would post would probably be a bit more haphazard.\n\nI would also like to ask /u/rdeluca, and all the moderators, not to hold against me whatever happened between you and /u/redditcoruum. I had nothing to do with that. I hope in the fullness of time you will allow her to continue her efforts educating delivery drivers, letting them know that they can change their work conditions for the better. That they do not have to accept illegal conditions of employment, that there are agencies, and attorneys, out there that will help with addressing those issues.\n\n___\nIt all started back around December of 2011. My employer, a franchise of Papa Johns in Washington and Oregon, had posted a document in my store. The document informed us that a few things would be changing. Specifically is said:\n\n&gt; Due to the Minimum Wage increase in 2012, On January 1st, 2012 we will be reducing the payments made in the existing Delivery Fee matrix by $.10. … As you all know the Minimum Wage is going up in January of 2012. … This is happening at a time when we are still confronting all time high commodities pricing, and we are still largely operating in a hyper competitive environment... This reduces our ability to raise prices and pass these cost increases to our Guest. … Our hope is that this change will be offset by the amount of wage increase you are receiving.\n\nWhat this meant was that our reimbursement was being reduced by 10¢ per delivery. This did not sit well with me. That amount, 10¢ per delivery, might not sound like a lot, but I was averaging 5,000 deliveries per year, so this would have meant a reduction of around $500 a year in mileage reimbursement. It should also be noted that this did not just effect me, it effected hundreds of other delivery drivers; while my experience of losing $500 might not seem significant, take into consideration that that $500 becomes a savings for the employer, multiply that by hundreds of other delivery drivers. A conservative savings, using my location as a baseline^1, this decrease in mileage reimbursement represented, approximately, at least a $48,300 per year reduction in expense, which (at least to me) means that savings could be banked by the owners of the business.  In other words, a profit on the backs of their employees)\n\nWhat also is not mentioned in the complaint is that the delivery fee was also being increased at the same time. It is my opinion, as well as the opinion of most delivery drivers I know, that an increase in delivery fee directly effects gratuities in at least the short term; so the increase would also likely effect my gratuities.\n\nI do not remember how it came to be, but I had coffee with a driver from another store sometime in December of 2012 or January of 2013. We sat and talked about the job and I brought up the new decrease in mileage reimbursement and increase in delivery fee. She told me I should look up Perrin v Papa Johns International.\n\nWhen I got home I put 'perrin v papa johns' into google and the only result returned at that time was for a post at the Pizza Delivery Driver Forum, [Perrin v. Papa John's International, Inc.](http://gregspages.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1284). If you [search now](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=perrin+v+papa+john%27s&amp;t=ffsb) you find many links to this lawsuit. I read a lot on that website in the next few weeks and I was educated/enlightened. I highly suggest that if anyone wants to educate themselves on this topic, their first resource should be that forum.\n\n\nIn the early part 2012 I contacted the firm of [Sebris, Busto, and James](http://sebrisbusto.com/). After a meeting with one of the partners, [Mark Busto](http://sebrisbusto.com/attorneys/getMarkRBusto.asp), I explained the situation and presented my findings. I also informed Mark about the[Perrin v. Papa John's International, Inc.](http://gregspages.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1284). A few days later I was told that the firm would be willing to take my case under a contingency fee agreement. We negotiated back and forth, [Tina Aiken](http://sebrisbusto.com/attorneys/getTinaMAiken.asp) representing their firm, for a few weeks until we came to came to an agreement acceptable to both parties. Then the real work started.\n\nWe, [Tina Aiken](http://sebrisbusto.com/attorneys/getTinaMAiken.asp) and I, gathered as much evidence as we could to compose the complaint. Mainly my recollections of past expenses for my two vehicles that I had been using for the job and the documents showing the company's policies; the memo referenced earlier and the 'Delivery Fee Matrix'. Some of the information we gathered was forwarded to our expert witness, where he/she came up with an estimate of my actual expenses. To my knowledge [Tina Aiken](http://sebrisbusto.com/attorneys/getTinaMAiken.asp) wrote the complaint and I assisted in proof-reading and suggesting corrections. It was a lengthy process, we wanted to get the complaint correct and on point in all aspects. In June of 2012 my complaint, [case #2:12-cv-01375 Kurth v. Seattle PJ Pizza LLC et al](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kurth+v+seattle+PJ+pizza&amp;t=ffsb), was filed with the court.  I was an active member of the Pizza Delivery Driver Forum at this time and had the complaint posted there; you can read my comments and download the entire complaint, in PDF format, [here](http://gregspages.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1905).\n\nDuring the time we were composing the complaint I learned of another lawsuit against my employer, [Agne v. Papa Johns et al.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=agne+v+papa+johns&amp;t=ffsb) I also learned that I was a potential member of that legal action. I was contacted by the attorney representing that case, [Donald Heyrich](https://hkm.com/attorneys/donald-w-heyrich/), and asked if I would be willing to provide any information regarding their complaint. I agreed to provide an affidavit and evidence that I was also effected by the actions taken by my employer and became a supporting member of the Class action lawsuit. You can download the complaint, in PDF format [here](http://gregspages.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1703), and read some comments about the case. Anyways... back to my story.\n\nWell, I thought we had a pretty open and shut case and that there would be a quick settlement, damn was I naive. We hit a few roadblocks along the way, one (1) major and a few minor, but ultimately a settlement was reached in November of 2013. One of those roadblocks will be discussed in a future story. That settlement resulted in a mileage reimbursement increase of more than 66%. We went from a maximum mileage reimbursement (which we had not received in about 3 years) of $0.25 per mile to a rate of $0.375 per mile.\n\nIn the next few weeks I'll be posting additional stories of things that have happened since then. I am still employed at the same location and do my level best to effect a positive change for all the employees, but mainly the delivery drivers, in my franchise. Some of the stories I will tell in the future will hopefully show others how they can make a difference for themselves and others. And, if you're like me (a royal pain in the ass) you might learn how to piss your employer off and still keep your job.\n\n___\n\n^1: If anyone would like I can show you how I came to this number in a follow-up post.",

        "text": "Last night, we had 50% off on all online orders because a specific sports team won on Monday. Tuesdays generally aren't that busy, and by 9PM, it had slowed down enough that most of us were either on our phones or tidying up the store.\n\nSo a woman walks in to pick up some food, and she's wearing pajamas. Like full-on, pink, fuzzy, onesie-type pajamas. (Which I think is trashy; my mom always told me that you don't go out in public in your PJs unless it's 3AM and you're making an emergency trip to the gas station or something. But oh well.)\n\nMy encounter with Pajama Lady (PL) went like this:\n\nMe: Hi, are you here for pickup?\n\nPL: Yeah, I'm picking up for Richard.\n\nMe (*checks out the carryout section on the computer and sees a Richard listed*): All right, it's going to be $37.\n\nPL (*looks confused*): I did the order online and it was $23.\n\nMe: Was the order for two pizzas, cheesesticks and chicken strips with honey mustard?\n\nPL: No, it was [something else that had chicken strips w/ buffalo sauce on the side]. \n\nMe: Maybe it's under a different name. (*Checks carryout listing again*) Would it be under Natasha, Diego, or Carlos?\n\nPL: No! Richard!\n\nAt this point, she starts getting very agitated. She pulls out her phone and presumably starts to text this mysterious Richard about the \"lost\" order, getting more and more pissed as she types.\n\nPL (*angrily*): You guys should have it! We ordered online!\n\nI decided to check the delivery section just in case. As I was doing that, she yelled something, picked her keys up off the counter, and stormed out.\n\nI found the order within like 30 seconds of her leaving. It was for *delivery* and was already out when she got here. Hope she felt stupid when the driver arrived with the food.",

Just a normal day until another one of our drivers accidentally bumped his door against a customer's door as he was getting out of the car (I wasn't at work that day so I only assume that they were sitting in the car). Our driver politely apologizes for doing but the customer was furious. Please note that it didn't leave a single scratch on either car. They go into the store as they haven't gotten their food yet and the shit storm begins. Our assistant manger offered to give a discount in hopes that they would shut up but the customer insists that the food be free. Our assistant manager dies that request and the customers says they don't want the food and leaves.\n\n   This brings us to the good part. That wasn't the last we heard from that angry customer that day. An undisclosed amount of time later that disgruntled customer decides to call the store and my very stoned friend answers the phone. The customer begins yelling at my friend who's really confused because he didn't do it. So my stoned friend replies saying, \n\n\"Alright well, call back in two days when someone who actually cares like my manager is working\". \n\nThen he hangs up the phone. \n\nAt this point my assistant manager is there listening to him and freaks out when he said that. She heads to the back to call our GM and his response is, \"I'm not worried about it.\" Our assistant manager tells my friend to call the customer back and apologize and my friend replies, \"Why would I apologize for something I didn't do?\" \n\nI don't believe my blazed the fuck out friend really understood why he was in trouble as he called me while on his next delivery and  told he got in trouble for nothing. To this day he never got in trouble for it either... \n\nLet this be a warning, if you go to work stoned, make sure you can handle your shit. \n\n   ",

Today is slow and we have had 4 come back so far today. One of my less understanding customers insists it is our fault and went as far as demanding I compensate him for him not getting his food on time. He gave us the wrong phone number and lives in a dorm at the college we deliver to, which is locked. When I tried to explain that he gave us the wrong number and that is why he is pie-less it infuriated him to the point where he called me a bitch and hung up. \n\nJoke is on him, it was paid in a credit card. He has to talk to me for a refund which I may chose not to give him! ",

I've even had a few who accidentally called from a neighboring city.\n\nThe best one, though, was when a woman called to tell us she had accidentally ordered from our store here in South Florida when she actually lived in Orlando, and that she wanted me to transfer the order to the store in Orlando. My city and Orlando are ~240 miles apart. Apparently, she had recently moved to Orlando, forgot to update her address on [store name]'s website when she ordered the pizza, and accidentally ended up ordering from us.

Today however my sarcasm filter apparently broke. I blame it on that truly magical property of snow- the ability to turn even the most brilliant person into a complete retard. Fortunately neither of these exchanges were made with customers or I'd be looking for work but I thought they'd be worth sharing with some of you (Particularly if you happen to have the shared misfortune of doing bike delivery for Jimmy John's).\n\nFirst off you should know that my city got it's firs \"snow\" of the season today- meaning that you've been able to see snow flakes coming down all day long, but nothing actually stuck to the ground until around 12:40.\n\nAs I'm locking my bike up outside the courthouse a gentleman wearing a suit and with that annoying air of \"I'm better than you because I make more money\" that all lawyers has paused from smoking.\n&gt;Lawyer: They make you ride you bike for deliveries even in this weather?\n\n&gt;Me: Well normally we'd just take the helicopter around town but it's in the shop.\n\nI turned and walked inside to finish my delivery while he just stood there and stared at me.\n\n-------\nStuck in a freight elevator (I'm not entirely sure why the office buildings downtown insist that we use them when all we have to carry is a paper bag- are they afraid their tenets will seem human if it's revealed they eat?) a cleaning woman notices the snow that's begun to stick to my helmet and coat. *please don't say something stupid*\n\n&gt;Woman: Oh is it snowing outside?\n\n&gt;Me: No, I just have really bad dandruff.\n\n&gt;Woman: Well you don't have to be rude about it!\n\n&gt;Me: Hey you brought it up. I've tired everything and it just keeps getting worse. You think I want to look like a yeti?\n\n&gt;Woman: I think this is my floor!\n\n\nYes I'm a dick but honestly if your going to ask a stupid question, expect a stupid answer back. although I probably could have been less snippy with them the fact that I made $12.25 in tips from 14 runs probably contributed to my mood.",

I began working for a Domino's Franchisee as an insider a year and a half ago and was promoted to Assistant Manager within three months. I was given a $0.50 raise from minimum wage at that time. Now, a little over a year later, I am still making that same wage, however, I have been tasked with twice the responsibility in the last 7 months. A new GM arrived and while he has a great system and is good at tunning the show, he needs a lot of support. He's an older guy and not great with technology, so I make the schedules on the computer for all 20+ employees, order the Soda when I open on Friday (Unless the other Assistant Manager is opening, then he does,) and take inventory every Sunday. These are all typically his functions, and although he makes only $0.50 more than me, (the franchisee is not generous with his hourly pay) he also gets bonuses based on the labor, food costs, and sales. Two of those three I am directly responsible for and I don't see a cent of that money. I understand that I am working in a pizza joint and that I am essentially unskilled labor, but am I wrong to think I should be making more money?\n\nTL;DR: Making $0.50 over minimum wage as an Assit. Manager. Perfom many of the GM's task for him. No raise thus far.",

At least it isn't the whiny guy at the assisted living center on X Street who guilt trips us about the prices. \n\n\nI arrive at the nursing home and park my car. The front doors are usually unlocked but it's after 6 p.m. so I need the code to get it; luckily I have it on the ticket. I enter it and get nothing. One more time and still nada. Third time is a charm. No, third time is apparently when a screeching alarm goes off. Can no one hear it? Damn. I call the number on the ticket to try and sort this out. \n\n\nHim: \"Yeah?\"\n\n\nMe: \"Hello, sir, this is your pizza delivery driver. I can't seem to get in with the code you've provided and an alarm of some kind is going off, don't know if you can hear it. I may need someone to let me in.\" I say \"someone\" because I presume he is a resident and likely debilitated. \n\n\nHim: *groans* \"Yeah I'll come down. Might take a while I don't have any clothes on yet.\"\n\n\nMe: \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\nHe wasn't lying when he said it would take a while. I had thought about pulling my car around to stay warm but then a shuttle pulls up and an attendant wheels out a resident. I might as well just follow them in and I'll run into the customer on his way down to speed this thing up. He notices the sound, looks at me and gets a sheepish smile in return, key cards the door and the alarm stops so I follow him to the elevator. The resident is an old woman and the attendant is a younger man. \n\n\nHer to him: \"I saw a movie at church today!\"\n\n\nWe get in the elevator. \n\n\nHim: \"I'm going to face you towards the back so they can access your chair. I don't go to the second floor, this is my stop. Have a good night.\"\n\n\nHer: \"I saw a movie at church today!\"\n\n\nHe bails. \n\n\nI'm going up in the elevator with only her now. Is this a thing? Does someone wait on the next floor to get her or what? I don't have to flag anyone down do I?\n\n\nThe elevator doors open and nobody is there. The desk is around the corner and out of sight. If I leave the elevator the doors are going to close with her in it. Is that okay? Seems weird. \n\n\nMe: \"Excuse me?\"\n\n\nGotta hit the open door button. \n\n\nMe: \"Excuse me?!\"\n\n\nJesus Christ. \n\n\nMe: \"Is someone coming for you?\"\n\n\nHer: \"Y'know, I saw a movie at church today.\"\n\n\nYou don't say. \n\n\nMe: \"Should I get you out of the elevator or is someone coming along?\"\n\n\nHer: \"The movie was War Room.\"\n\n\nAlright, looks like I'm on my own. I hit the open door button again and put the pizza down. I try to wheel out the chair but it won't budge. Of course, it's got the brakes on. I don't know where the fucking brakes are. I start searching the chair for the brakes while she's having a one way conversation about a Christian film and the door keeps closing on me and I'm trying to get anyone's attention. If I let the door close maybe I can find the brake so I don't press the button this time but I had set the pizza down outside of the elevator so *NO* I can't let it close so I stop it with my foot. Dammit! What the hell am I doing right now? What is this?! *I'M ONLY HERE TO DELIVER A PIZZA.* Saving geriatrics from being ditched in elevators isn't in the job description! I'm obviously panicking and overwhelmed but this whole situation has probably only been about a minute or two long. Finally an attendant or nurse or whatever walks around the corner and sees me jerking this chair around with one foot out of the elevator. \n\n\nHer: \"What is going on here?\"\n\n\nMe: \"Hey, I'm trying to find the brake on her chair so I can get her out.\"\n\n\nHer, while shooting daggers at me: \"I've got this, what is going on?\"\n\n\nMe: \"I don't know, the guy said he doesn't go past the elevator and left her and I didn't see anyone-\"\n\n\nHer: \"What guy?\"\n\n\nMe: \"I don't know I don't work here! I'm just looking for a customer I'm delivering a pizza.\"\n\n\nShe relaxes her face when she figures out I'm the pizza guy and I don't know what the hell is going on. \n\n\nHer: \"Who are you looking for then?\"\n\n\nMe: \"So-and-so.\"\n\n\nHer: \"Oh we just sent him downstairs he should be at the main entrance.\"\n\n\nMe: \"I don't think so, I didn't see him down there. Did he take the stairs?\"\n\n\nHer: \"No he's in a wheelchair he went in the elevator.\"\n\n\nMe: \"He couldn't have, I would've seen him.\"\n\n\nHer: \"We have another elevator at the other side of the building.\"\n\n\nOf course you do. I wait upstairs while she goes to get him and bring him back up. We do the usual transaction and he still tips a couple bucks. I thank the lady for helping me out and then I get out. I laugh the situation off in the car, still not understanding if old people normally chill in elevators at those places, and get my head straight by the time I get back to the store. I driver in and check the next delivery. \n\n\nIt's going to the whiny guy from the assisted living center on X Street. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A couple weeks ago (December 23rd, to be exact,) I was planning to have a few friends over after our half day at school to sort of close out the year, reign in Christmas, etc. etc. It was a really shitty day for the weather - I know firsthand because I got in a pretty bad accident coming home from school. The turn I was going around was just a little too slippery and the traffic was backed up so I rearended a guy and slid into the other lane where I hit another car. I totalled my car and and got charged with careless driving, so in all I had a pretty shitty afternoon. My friends all ended up coming over anyway, and the weather got a lot worse. When we called up the local pizza place at 8, then, and asked for a delivery, we were all surprised to hear the affirmative. We got two pies (I forget how much that ran us...Maybe 20?) and I asked for the pizza guy to draw his favorite Jedi because we'd all seen Star Wars the previous night. He rolled into my driveway at like 8:30 and pulled out the most delicious pizza I'd had in a long time. To top it all off, a majestic Yoda bid us a merry christmas on the top box. We handed the delivery kid like $40 bucks for the drawing and driving in the shitty weather and enjoyed some damn fine pizza. If you're reading this, Tyler, you're a fucking beast man. Gnight everyone :D",

        "text": "I am an inside crew member, who's worked in Papa John's for almost four years. This story concerns a woman who is the bane to most of the inside crew and managers.\n\nUntil last fall, she was getting free food quite often, always claiming that the thin crust pizzas she always ordered were always cold. A previous manager, who quit in the spring, used to throw money (read: our product) at problems, including this particular customer. After an incident during the summer in which this customer was trying for more free food, our new assistant manager looked up the customer's order history. Turns out, she's gotten well over a $1000 of food out of us, between comps and refunds, in the past two years. When our assistant showed this to the store manager, he clamped down on it, telling this woman that if her food wasn't coming back properly as deliveries, perhaps it might be better if she came to do carryouts. We didn't hear from her for a while.\n\nTonight, she called in an order for delivery. I took the call, but apparently, this customer was still bitter over her 'gravy train' being taken from her. \n\n\"Thanks for calling Papa Johns, this is Avie speaking. Would you like to try a Brookie for $6?\"\n\n\"No, what are your other specials?\"\n\n\"Well, we've got the Buy One at regular menu price, Get one for .50, and also our 3-topping large for $12--\"\n\n\"No! Those won't work for me! I want a Works, no mushroom or olives, and a half Meats, half cheese, both large! **REGULAR CRUST!** I **would** order a thin crust, but you **never** manage to get my stuff to me on time, and it's always cold! I'll **just have** to settle for your chewy hand-tossed crust, instead, I guess...unless you can **guarantee** it will be hot?\"\n\nI knew what she was up to, but I figured, go with customer service, so I went ahead.\n\n\"I apologize, ma'am, but ----\"\n\n\"**I don't like your attitude!**\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to say anything to offend you. Would you like to continue?\"\n\n*huff!* \"I guess I'm gonna have to...\"\n\n\nEventually she finished placing her order. After checking in with my manager, we agreed that there was nothing else I really could have done, barring not taking her order at all.\n\nHas anyone else here had a customer who almost never paid/was almost always refunded their money, and was cut off?",

One of the nights where the food was coming out when the drivers were coming in, orders arranged themselves so it would be easy to deliver (1,2,and 3 going one way, 4,5, and 6 the other) and orders were super simple.  The night has slowed down and we get a delivery to one of our regular hotels. 1 pizza, 1 lasagna,and a 2liter. Since I'm next, I snag it and another order around the corner from the hotel and head out.\n\nGet to the hotel and the guy at the front desk goes and grabs me some plates, forks, etc. and we talk for a minute. He makes a comment about me getting a bigger tip for having the stuff and I tell I wish, but most people already know how much they want to tip before you even get there. So off I head to the room.\n\nGet to the room and I knock on the door. Guy inside say hold on a minute. So I'm waiting by the door and about a minute passes and I hear a woman say the same thing. I could here a lot of shuffling going on so I assume I caught them doing the dirty. Second later I hear a door close and the room door opens about 5-6 Inches wide and the guy's hand is the only visible part of this guy. He asks how much it is and I tell him the total (22.xx) while handing him the drink and the utensils. He then holds out some bills and says\"Here's $100. Happy new year\". I asked if he was sure, and he said yeah, then proceeded to nonchalantly ask if I still had the lasagna and pizza.  Hand them to him and we exchange our good byes.\n\nGet down to the lobby where the front desk guy and a guest are chatting when the FD guy asks if I got a tip. When I told him his and the guest jaws just dropped. This last year has been really rough for me and I hope this is a sign that things will get better.",

After a few months I began to notice the same drivers and they started getting to my house SUPER fast and the food was always made really well so I started gradually tipping a dollar extra here or there. \n\nI can see on the tracker that it's the same guy making my food 90% of the time, and it's always one of 3 guys delivering to me, but twice in the last month I've had 2 of the guys come back to my door after they've left and ask me \"Did you mean to tip this?\" and repeat my total. The first time my order total was ~$23 and I gave $30. Last night it was $19.XX and I gave $30 as well. I figured it was New Years so why not. I don't know, after being asked a second time I started to wonder, do I come across as someone incapable of counting money or understanding my total? These guys have to recognize me to some extent and know I tip well so I don't understand why they'd double check? It's not like I'm giving them a totally outrageous tip so I don't get it. I just tip decent because I worked retail type jobs for many years and know people are awful, and I now have quite a bit of extra money.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid because I generally only order after drinking/smoking a bit so I'm wondering if that's apparent to them. Are they just being nice or what?\n",

Eventually This lady makes the very first order: bread and an extra large specialty pizza that has, among other things, garlic parmesian sauce instead of the normal tomato sauce and diced tomatoes. Z makes the pizza, and since it is fairly slow this morning, he takes his time and makes it as perfect as he can, he even made sure we all saw how pretty it was. W takes the delivery out, which takes him about 25 minutes to get back. \nAs soon as he walks back in the door, the lady calls back and says the pizza had no sauce and the bread was undercooked. We assume she just didn't realize it had a different sauce, so S remakes her order and puts the bread back in the oven a bit to make it more well-done than usual just to be safe. Unfortunately, I get to take the delivery this time.  \nI get there and the lady comes out all smiles and thank you's and whatnot. I have her check the food to make sure it is to her liking. She says it's good and gives me the first delivery. I take it to my car and check it for myself. It is completely fine. I think she is just a little weird, and I didn't get a tip (not that I was expecting one), but at least she was nice. Then the husband comes out.   \nHe is carrying the new pizza and he asks me why this pizza doesn't have tomatoes. I explain the different sauce, and he opens his box and says \"look at the other one, it has tomatoes.\" It was true, S apparently forgot to put the diced tomatoes on this new pizza. I apologize and say that it was a mistake, and he just goes off. \"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU! YOU CAN'T GET IT RIGHT YOU FUCKING JACKASS!\" And he throws the pizza at me and storms back inside. Lucky for me his aim is as terrible as his attitude, so he didn't actually hit me. So I call S and have him blacklist the guy, no orders, delivery or carry-out, for him ever again.  \n\nWhat a great way to start the new year. ",

        "text": "I work in a big 3 chain in a large city. My delivery area is very fast growing, and sometime we get ridiculously slammed. This was one of those times. \n\nNYE, we were pretty slow all night long (had a full staff though as we knew what was coming). About 15 minutes after midnight, the phone starts blowing up, orders are streaming in via the web. We stay open til 3am and are one of the latest open pizza joints. \n\nI ran my ass off for three hours until just before 3am when I roll into the store from a delivery to see that we had made it to the 3am cutoff to receive new orders. All I had to do was get through this long list of lates and we'd be done. \n\nLucky me, I can do a nice looking quad! I start packing everything up and start taking it out to the car when I notice that one of the delivery instructions says \"Hilton.\" I know for certain that there is no hotel in the area where the address is and that the addy looks very similar to the location of the downtown Hilton that is not in our delivery area. On another, slower night, I may have just taken the order to its destination anyway since it was so late at night we can't transfer their order to the correct store, but definitely not at this point. \n\nI tell the CSRs, they confirm that the customer told them this exact address, so it's not our fault. I leave the order in store and let them know I can't take it in the direction I'm heading, so if they wanna call the customer or have someone bring it anyway on another run that it's up to them. \n\nSo that was strike one. \n\nI take the first of my three remaining orders to its destination, a locked condo building. I recognize the name and address, so I'm pretty hopeful the person will be there and awake and shit. At this point it's actually only been an hour and ten minutes since the order was placed and I know my next runs will be even newer, so I'm thinking I can salvage this now-triple into a decent tip opportunity. \n\nI text the guy that I have arrived like he asked, wait about three minutes and then call since I didn't get a response. No answer. I call again in case he was asleep. Leave a VM that I'm here for a couple more minutes so please respond or come down quickly. \n\nA few minutes passes (I was there for about seven minutes total, in 29 degrees standing at the door holding my pizza bag). Time to go. \n\nThat was strike two. \n\nNext one up is about 6 blocks down the same street. I arrive, another locked building to which I don't have a code saved or memorized. I use the callbox, no answer. Text from my phone, then use callbox again. Call from my phone, leaving a VM that I need to move on soon. No answer, another 7 minutes wasted in the cold, for no delivery. \n\nThat was strike 3. \n\nI move on to the last order, I don't even need to get in my car, it was a half block away from where I parked. I recognize the address as a building that is not locked, it's a big open-air building that I can access freely. Great! Except the guy has no apt # on his info. \n\nAs I walk down the street toward the place, I call his number. No answer. I leave a msg asking for the unit # and text the same question. And I stand, looking at the building, checking windows for light, waiting for him to get back to me. Call again, wait some more. Another 7 minutes wasted waiting in the cold. \n\nI slowly walk back to my car while leaving the same message I left the other three strikeouts. Basically, \"I'm sorry we missed making your delivery, if you get this message in the next ten minutes or so, please call me back and I will re-deliver because I am nearby. Thanks!\" \n\nThat was the strike four. \n\nI return to the store at 3:35am with my stack of filled bags and a bummed out look on my face. I tell my GM what happened and he says, \"Honestly, that's almost kind of impressive.\" \n\ntl;dr Sleeping and/or drunk people turn what could be a profitable last run of the night quad into a total strikeout.

        "text": "A little bit of the background:\n\nI used to work for a pizza company and I mainly made delivery runs, so I completely understand how painful and stressful and just down-right unlucky making deliveries can be. Since working for... an unsaid company... delivering pizzas and such, I've come to appreciate a lot of delivery drivers and fast food employees. And I always tip within a 15-25% range whenever I order in. I even started tipping the Subway sandwich crafter, after I pay for the meal, because I understand where he/she is at. And I'm always polite to anyone working in that field, and I want them to know I do appreciate them and their hard work (This goes for you guys/gals too, so thank you all).\n\nAnyways, to make a long story longer, after I resigned from my delivery position, I started working for security. This particular site I'm at has cameras almost everywhere inside and outside of the place. And I'm in charge of watching the outside monitors. They cover the entirety of the parking lot, the main entrance, and everywhere in between. Saying this, I see any vehicle that arrives on property way before they get to the front doors. (This information is important to understanding my conflict)\n\nThis is the situation:\n\nI had decided to call ahead on an order for a, not to be named, pizza place for a delivery order. Everything went smoothly as I placed the order, and she had told me that the delivery time would be extended due to the amount of orders they had. So instead of a 45 minute delivery, they quoted about an hour. Which I had said was perfectly fine. About an hour and 45 minutes later I was starting to get kind of worried, when I saw a vehicle turn onto the property, going at what seemed to be light speed. I could tell from the cameras that it was the place I was waiting on. I saw the driver pull up to the front entrance and stop next to the curb. Now mind you, it takes legitimately all of two minutes for me to walk outside and meet him/her. And as soon as I saw him/her stopped, I started walking there. I had just gotten to the front doors to walk outside when I saw him/her peeling away and was gone just as fast as he/she had arrived (He/she was only here for about 7 minutes all together from the first time I saw him/her on camera, to the moment he/she disappeared off property). So, I thought that maybe he/she had made a mistake and picked up the wrong order (I've done that at least twice, and I know the feels). I gave him/her about 25 mins to make it back to the store, knowing it's only about 5 minutes down the street, and decided to call the store myself to see what was going on when he/she never came back.\n\nThis is what they said to me:\n\nWhen I called the actual company, they had told me that the driver moved on to his/her next order. They said that the driver had had told them that he/she had called me multiple times, trying to reach me by the number I called them at, could not contact me, and moved on.\n\nAt first I was really confused because I made sure that my phone, the one I called them from, was on, really close by (was in my pocket at the time), and had the volume turned all the way up. So, I asked if they had gotten my number correct. Which she had repeated back to me completely spot on. I tripled checked my phone to look for any missed calls or texts or voice mails or anything, and there was absolutely nothing besides the two outgoing calls I had made to their company store. So, I explain that I do not have any missed calls and asked if there was any possible way for me to receive the order since I had already paid for it in full using my debit card. She put me on hold as she called the delivery driver about it and asked him/her to re-make the delivery. After about 15 more minutes of being on hold, she tells me that the driver is too busy to go back. \n\nI'm not going to lie, I was getting a little frustrated at this point, and hearing that just made it worse. But it wasn't like I was being rude or obnoxious, it was more like none of this made sense to me and 0% of this was my fault, but I was being blamed for it all. So, I asked what my options were. She told me that either she could put the amount on a credit for that store only or I could go up there and pick up the order. I tried to explain to her that I was unable to leave my work because I'm legally responsible for anything that happens on site during my shift and I needed to be here. And it just so happens that I'll have the next three days off and the travel time between my work and my house is roughly around an hour (And in all honesty, I don't know any people that would drive an hour for a less than $20 order to bring home). And, on top of that, that was my last night working at that site as I was being transferred to a new site, a lot closer to my home. So, at no point and time would I be able to order from that particular store again, as I would not be in the area again.\n\nResolution/Ending outcome:\n\nAt this point I could tell that the woman I was speaking to was clearly frustrated with this entire situation. And I could hear ringing in the background from other callers wanting to make orders. She had said she was putting me on hold for just a minute. I was on hold for close to 40 minutes before the call ended. I immediately called back, but get no answer. I tried calling a few more times throughout that night, and it all ended the same way until the said company store was closed. In the end, I wasted close to 4 hours, lost about $18.00, and seemingly got my number blocked by that particular store. \n\nAs far as right this instance, I have no clue as to what to do in this situation at all. The LAST thing I want to do is cause a scene in that store or get anyone fired. My biggest worry is the money I lost. And I have not an inkling of an idea of what to do to try to get it back. I was sharing this with you all because I was hoping that you had some ideas or had some comments about this entire ordeal. \n\nTL;DR: Ordered a delivery from a pizza company, only to end up with 4 hours wasted, $18.00 gone with no sight of a refund, and being blocked from calling that particular store again, all the while being confused about the entire situation.",

        "text": "I want to start out by wishing everyone a Happy New Year! Whether you're out making deliveries or you're just going out for some fun, PLEASE BE SAFE. Don't drink and drive. Seriously. Or else I'll ban you from eating pizza forever. I can do that.\n\nI wanted to make this post to let everyone know that we are going to be implementing a few rule changes/clarifications as well as starting some new discussion threads. I was kicking around the idea of turning this sub into more of a hub for delivery drivers, new and experienced, where we can discuss delivery tactics, labor laws (yes, I said it), wages, and other stuff like that in centralized posts instead of just the comments section of a story. The other mods thought it was a good idea as well, so here we are.\n\nStories will still be the main focus, so keep 'em coming, but don't be shy about coming here for actual discussion as well.\n\nI will be updating the sidebar with a new set of rules as well. Not much is changing, it's mostly just re-wording and clarification.\n\nNew rules are as follows: ***Rules 2 and 3 have been reworked***\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\n1.) Don't be a dick to your fellow Redditors.\n\n2.) ~~Low-effort posts will be removed.~~ Low-effort question posts such as \"What's it like to drive for X company?\" or \"How much money do you make?\" will be removed. Validity of a question-based post will be left up to the mods' discretion.\n\n3.) Please refer to stickied discussion posts if you have general questions about food delivery or other food industry related questions. If you have a different question that you want to post, please make sure that it is a story-leading question. ~~Low-effort question posts such as \"What's it like to drive for X company?\" or \"How much money do you make?\" will be removed. Validity of a question-based post will be left up to the mods' discretion.~~\n\n4.) Absolutely no posting of personal information of co-workers, or customers. Not only is this against reddit's site-wide rules, it is incredibly unprofessional and handing out customer info will usually result in immediate job termination. Feel free to talk about yourself, your store, and general location, but leave specifics out. If  a redditor can find out who you are by looking through your post history, then so can your employer.\n\n5.) Don't start arguments about tipping, tipping culture, labor, or wages. If you want to have a civil discussion about it, that is fine, but if the discussion breaks Rule 1, we will remove it. This is not the sub for arguments.\n\n6.) Obvious trolling will result in an instant, permanent ban.\n\n7.) Any variation of “kill yourself” or other similar insults will result in an instant ban as well.\n\n8.) No copypasta, obviously fake stories, or pun posts. Refer to Rule 2.\n\n9.) If you don't believe a story, keep it to yourself. This isn't /r/thathappened and \"Reddit Truth Police\" will be banned immediately. We don't care about your opinions on validity.\n\n10.) No linking to non-reddit forums and no advertising.\n\n11.) No raiding of other forums or subs or ganging up on certain members. Also, try to keep the circle-jerking to a minimum. The downvote button isn't a 'disagree' button. If someone has an unpopular opinion, try to hear them out.\n\n*^Rules ^can ^change ^at ^any ^time ^as ^the ^moderators ^deem ^necessary.  ^Definitions ^of ^'being ^a ^dick' ^are ^up ^to ^the ^mods' ^discretion. ^Racism, ^general ^trolling, ^and ^verbal ^abuse ^are ^included ^in ^that ^definition.\n_________________________________________\nBreaking of the rules can can have consequences up to and including:\n\n* A stinky face flair next to your name\n* Removal of your comment (free speech is for chumps)\n* Banning from posting in this subreddit\n\n....................................................................................................\n\nFeel free to [contact the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTalesFromThePizzaGuy) if you have a question.\n    \n_________________________________________________\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nStickied discussion/info posts will start either tomorrow or over the weekend. It'll probably just be general discussion/questions for now. If you're a customer who has a question about something, feel free to drop in there as well. I know we haven't really had an 'ask the driver' thread in ages. Same if you're a new driver and want tips on what to do or how the job is going to be (or check the sidebar for more info).\n\nHave a Happy New Year everyone!",

I had a feeling in the pit of my gut that something was going to happen. And after getting sworn at and someone attempting to gip me $10, this feeling grew worse.\n\nAround 8.30, I took a del to an area maybe 5 mins away from the store, I missed the street and popped a u turn and quickly pulled over to check my map book to make sure I knew where I was going. A white volkswagen golf (I think). Made the exact same U turn, and stopped on the other side of the road from, I didn't think much at the time, until I left for the delivery, and they followed me. \n\nThe idiots parked across the road from me the entire time, giving me a good chance to look at their custom number plate, and make of their car. Once I returned to my vehicle, they ran out and threw water balls and small rocks at my car. No damage sustained but that's not the point. These fucking preppy rich kids in a fancy car Daddy paid for decided to target me while I'm at work busting my nut to make a buck. They then run. Fucking cowards. \n\nI then returned to the store, and found at that they'd hit another driver that night as well. Fucking useless cunts. So I asked the manager on if I could use the office phone to call the police, and the store manager came in to get a few drinks. I told him what happened and he gave me the non emergency number for the police and told me to make a police report.\n\n I'm lucky I have such good managers and fellow drivers. But that's my little story, no damage done, but I don't care, it's the fact that these little fuckers followed me, and made me scared, because as we all know, it can be a dangerous gig, especially at night, never knowing if we're gonna get jumped or what have you. \n\nOh well. Hope the police catch the little fuckers, but I doubt they'll get much more than a fine to be honest, the justice system favours the perpetrators over here.  \n\n\nUPDATE; I'd just like to say, I really dig how us Delivery Driver's stick together and support each other, I was prepared for the usual Reddit shitstorm of down votes and snide comments, but you guys melted my heart with your support and advice &lt;3. The brother/sisterhood of Delivery Drivers is what keeps me going in this job!",

Net, because it's cash in hand at the end of the night.\n\nThere was also on occasion a couple weeks ago where I delivered 29 pizzas to a function and ended up getting paid $43 for what was probably 40 minutes of work including drive time and setup.\n\nHow do you guys get paid?

        "text": "For starters, I don't deliver pizza nor am I a guy, but from what I gather you guys will probably enjoy my story so here it goes...\n\n\nI am a receptionist at a senior home with a pizza place about a mile and a half away. The nurses and CNAs will often order delivery from this pizza place and as the building is a secure building (signing in and out/locked units) the pizza guys will hang out in the lobby while I call the nurses to come get and pay for their food.\n\n\nNow there are a few nurses and CNAs that are really good about this. They'll call me ahead of time when they order so that when the delivery gets here I can find them easily and the delivery guy doesn't wait too long or they'll leave me with money or permission to sign for them if they know they'll be tied up when it gets here.\n\n\nNow, the vast majority of people that order do not do these courteous things which often result in me trying to get in touch with all of the different units to find out who ordered food. When this happens the delivery guys will often be stuck waiting in the lobby for 5-10 minutes and sometimes even longer. When this happens I usually chat with the guys about work and stuff so I have gotten to know a few of them. \n\n\nDuring the time they spend waiting they are missing out on tips from their next deliveries and that really makes me angry. Also it is not unusual for the people who make the drivers wait to be very poor tippers.\n\n\nYesterday, one of the delivery guys was waiting in our lobby for about 10 minutes by the time I tracked down who ordered food and she came up to pay and pick it up. \n\n\nHe told the girl the total was $10.86 and she handed him $11 and walked away.\n\n\nAfter she left he turned to me and said, \"After all that, this is what she gave me.\" and held up the $11.\n\n\nAt this point I was secretly fuming. Who give a $.14 tip after making the delivery guy wait for 10 minutes?????\n\n\nSo this is when I decided to make things right. I went to the gas station on my break and bought a Christmas card. I put 2, $10 bills in it and this message:\n\n\n\"Dear Delivery Guys,\n\nI'm sorry that people suck and make you wait forever to pick up their food. I'm sorry that they make you miss out on tips from other customers. But most of all, I'm sorry that no one ever taught them how to tip.\n\nHappy Holidays,\n\nKTBox15\n\nThe Receptionist\"\n\n\nI wrote the names of the 2 usual delivery guys on the envelope, drove it over to the restaurant, and gave it to the manager for them. I really hope it gets to them and they are able to see that not all people are shitty, inconsiderate, and rude.",

        "text": "Hey guys so I work for one of the bigger Canadian pizza chains, I really enjoy my job but after doing so calculations I think I'm not getting proper compensation for my work.\n\n- Our delivery area is 23KM Length &amp; 15Km width (Has variables, live on a peninsula) If there's a better way to explain the delivery area please tell.\n- I get paid minimum wage.\n- 70cents a delivery no matter how far the distance.\n- No mileage pay \n- I drive an average of 850-1100 km a week at work (200KM average a shift)\n- Shifts are usually only 3 hours long 5x a week\n- 20% off pizza, no discounts on anything else.\n- Keep my own tips.\n\nI feel like I'm putting a lot of KM on my vehicle for such low pay and without receiving any benefits on the side. Is this normal or should I seek employment at a different pizza company?\n\nI do really enjoy my job (Have physical problems, allows me to work without agony), but it feels like I'm destroying my car for chump change. I'd love to hear your opinions.\n",

        "text": "So I worked for a pizza company, thats named similar to a game thats played on a table, off and on about 3 years. I say off and on cause delivering was one of the most fun ive ever had. Hours sucked cause being a good driver doesnt get you sent home like you should even though you opened and it's now 10pm at night.... \n\nAny ways, incase some of you readers dont realize it, we remember that you stiffed us, especially if you order once a week. Theres still times when im out for a drive with my wife that I point to houses that dont tip worth shit.\n\nOne of the worse offenders of no tipping did in fact tip. But heres the thing. She tipped to the nearest 5 CENTS. So her order was 14.98 congrats on your .02 cent tip. And she ordered every monday. And didnt take showers, or at least we didnt think she did. Infact, we're not 100% sure she wasnt a he. The hairstyle was like an old jew fro(sorry that may not be correct terminology now but thats what I know it as) she didnt have any \"defining\" features and even the name could have gone either way. We hated her and would fight not to take her delivery. I shook her sprite once... I dont feel bad but I wouldnt ever do it again.\n\nNext up guy who ordered every week and didnt tip. This one isnt necessarily about a bad tipper it's what happened because we knew he was. Unlike the last one this guy was nice and I didnt mind too much to take his order. But we knew he never tipped. In comes new guy whose only been with us maybe a month. He decides he's going to write in a tip(we didnt know this at first). Well of course we all know something's wrong and wouldnt you know it the no tipper comes in with his receipt. The guy gets fired and we tried to get our manager to go to that dumbasses recruiter but he wouldn't.\n\nIdk about some of you guys but I would take phone calls as well as deliveries cause fuck lazy csr's. So I take a call one night to a shitty part of town and I get the delivery. I know I'm not getting a tip but that's not the point. I get there and these people are pissed I didn't bring their cheese packets that they \"asked\" for. Now heres the thing, I do bring packets for tippers or people who are nice. But if you lie to my face saying you asked for them and I took your call, im going to call you out on it. They shut up after that one.\n\nJust an fyi, our owner was a dick.  He wanted to charge for cheese packets. I dont just not bring cheese cause im evil and ruining your day. I dont want to get yelled at by the guy who signs my checks. So I deliver to a hotel one day and this woman asks for cheese. Well she didnt ask in the call so no cheese for you. She doesnt like that. She calls and wants cheese. Well tough shit you didnt tip me im not going out of my way for you. In comes manager, tells me I need to take her cheese. Nope. Im sticking to my guns. 30mins later she calls again says her pizza is cold and ruined because no cheese packets...wtf. So manager sends her new pizza with cheese packets. The driver took a huge handfull and we found out later another manager threw a handfull of packets in the box. \n\nThats all I can think if for now. I subbed and cant wait to read more stories.",

        "text": "This is just some rambling rumination. I'm out of juicy vignettes at the moment, yesterday having been a normal and good day.\n\nBut I found myself idly thinking today, on my day off, that I wish I were working today. That's a pretty good sign. I have often thought about my jobs when I'm not at them, of course, and I've enjoyed doing some problem solving on a weekend smoke break which could be applied during the week to some software challenge. But I never found myself wanting to be in the cubicle. Nor in my prior fast food jobs was I yearning for the grind during the time when I was off.\n\nBetween the good pay, friendly customers, and trustworthy management, the one thing I'd change is to get more hours. From what I can infer by the scheduling, I think they're trying to make sure that drivers don't qualify as full-time by making sure to schedule them for less than 32 hours, which is a completely understandable business strategy almost certainly dictated to the local management by the overall franchisee (again, just my guesses).\n\nThe job has its challenges, certainly. And my area seems to be particularly good, judging by a lot of what I've read here. But I thought it merited some praise given that so much of what we post are, understandably, whatever were our biggest challenges and annoyances.\n\nI'm only two months in. Hopefully I'll still feel as positive about this when I'm two years in. Compared to the fast food jobs I've done before, the pay is more than double here, there are fewer and higher-quality customer interactions, and the work is overall easier and less rushed. Compared to the software jobs I've done, the pay is admittedly lower, both because of fewer hours and lower rate. The rate is also volatile. However, it's still a competitive hourly (I can average $20/hr at this point and my guess is that's still improvable) and I'm still getting three-quarters of the hours. To my taste, it's less stressful. While I do face the dangers of driving, I don't face the risk of destroying a client's business through a critical bug. I suppose in a way it's six of one and half a dozen of another, but I find the concrete and straight-forward nature much easier to solve and thus more gratifying, as one can know a job was done well, rather than feeling like \"I know there are more bugs in there but I can't prove it or find them and it's going to ship with them\" or even \"I know that bug is going to hit on client systems and it will ship\".\n\nI'm not speaking for anyone else or suggesting anything to anyone. I'm just expressing gratitude for having found my way to this position. I've got plenty of other challenges to deal with. I'm quite happy to have my job be something reasonably simple and rewarding and leaving the complexities to my hobbies.",
