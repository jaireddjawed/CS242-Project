        "text": "With his Academy Award win for the Best Adapted Screenplay this year, James Ivory became the oldest Academy winner (Keifer, vulture.com). However, the film that got him his long-awaited Oscar, did not have the smoothest of journey to its eventual critical acclaim. Call Me by Your Name, which tells the story of the intense romance between 17 year old Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and his father’s 24 year old research intern, Oliver (Armie Hammer) over the course of a languid Italian summer, took almost a decade to come to fruition. In this decade, Luca Guadagnino, who started out as a location consultant, rose up in ranks to become a co-director (with Ivory) and then, eventually, the director of the film (Erbland, indiewire.com). It can be argued that, even while Ivory is credited as the sole writer, it is the auteuristic vision of Guadagnino that defines the final on-screen version of Call Me by Your Name. In fact, Guadagnino was credited as a co-writer until Ivory took him to arbitration by the Writers Guild of America, who ruled in favour of crediting Ivory as the sole screenwriter of the film (Johnson, pagesix.com). While the conflict seems to have been amicably resolved, with Guadagnino calling the process, ‘customary’, it is interesting to study the changes the influence of both these strong personalities had on the final project (qtd. In Johnson).\nThrough its ten year journey, the film saw various iterations of its screenplay being made. There are two versions that are widely available on the internet currently- one is the 95-page scrip submitted by James Ivory for shooting, and the other is the 82-page version released by Sony (scriptslug.com; sonyclassics.com). Analysing these two scripts gives us an idea of the changes in the vision of the film that had taken place. According to Ivory, he had submitted the screenplay by 2015 and eventually sold the rights of screenplay to the producers (qted.in Roxborough, hollywoodreporter.com). However, further changes had to be made to create the film within the available budget (Roxborough). It can be assumed that it was at this point that Luca Guadagnino’s vision comes to fore for the film. The significant changes that were made to the initial screenplay can be traced back to the advice that Guadagnino received from the famed filmmaker, Bernardo Bertolucci, telling him to keep the ‘essence’ of the script rather than transfer the script as it is on-screen (‘Call Me by Your Name Guardian TIFF Talks’ 00.47.23-00.47.56).\n[Full article with image references](https://www.desicinephiles.com/editors-pick/call-me-by-your-name-a-journey-from-page-to-screen.)",

        "text": "Like a fair amount of people in January of 2016, I was anticipating the release of Nate Parker's debut film *The Birth of a Nation*. It was the Sundance darling of that year, winning both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize for Drama. A lot of this stems from it coming off the heels of the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, and its subject matter. The film retells the story of one of the United States' most enigmatic figures in Nat Turner, a literate slave who led a violent rebellion in 1831 that claimed the lives of 60 white men, women, and children. After it was sold to 20th Century Fox for a record-breaking $17.5 million, opening the chances of a wide release that would qualify it for Academy consideration, anticipation stayed high until Parker found himself embroiled in controversy of his own, and the interest dropped in a near instant. In the wake of it, I stayed interested as I believed in separating the artist from their art, so the decision to see *The Birth of a Nation* wouldn't change. What I was left with was unfortunate mediocrity. As time passed, up to now, my feelings on the film soured even more, and one of its largest flaws lies in its director/writer/producer/star. Nate Parker's inability to let the story be told is trumped by a self-serving narrative that expresses a kind of tasteless auteurism.\n\nWhen telling the story of Nat Turner's rebellion, one needs to recognize that the events, as well as the life of Turner himself, are most notable for being poorly documented, aside from the most solid facts as recorded by attorney Thomas Ruffin Gray from Turner's own confessions. The accuracy of Gray's document is contested, with the explanation that it was a recount from a white transcriber Turner had contempt for, as Gray did Turner, and could possibly have been altered to be more narrative despite not expanding on other aspects of Turner's life, like his relationships with his masters or his overall intentions for the revolt. This gives room for a breadth of interpretation and creative liberties to take and make an engaging film out of the matter, forcing the creator to dig for their own conclusions. What Parker and story co-author Jean McGianni Celestin crafted was something uninspired that takes more from their experiences, and several regurgitations from other, better movies centered around American slavery. Rather than show how Turner's actions marked a major turn for black liberation, Parker chose to martyrise him and treat his efforts in the end as being in vain, with slavery still yet to be abolished. As a result, making himself the star places him in a *Braveheart*-like position, but with his need to express his acting skills outweighing the cinematic eye for scale that Gibson had in *Braveheart*, something Parker tries to emulate with admittedly gorgeous shots of the expansive cotton fields and use of natural light, but fails as various editing gaffes and shooting styles show his ineptitude as a director. As an actor, Parker has talent, but there's an unsubtle binary with how he performs: being soft-spoken or delivering inspirational sermons, with the occasional crying.\n\nIn addition, there's little introspective moments taken for Turner to let the audience into the workings of his mind, something also debated as Gray's document notes that he suffered from hallucinations that he interpreted as visions from God. References to some of these visions appear in the film, but only as awkwardly-placed edits of symbolism that have nothing to do with the narrative, and serve to affect ideas that sounded better on paper than in execution. One example is an insert shot of an ear of corn oozing blood following Nat looking at the battered body of his wife Cherry Ann. What's left is a blank slate of a man that Parker's presence and personal views can be projected upon, which explains the lack of obstruction from fellow slaves on his plan for revolt, aside from the house slave Isaiah, who's often portrayed as comical, while the others are stripped of agency or individual intelligence for the sake of being listeners to Turner's words. \n\nThat's to say nothing of how the women are written. Every female character with a speaking part, excluding the master Sam Turner's sister, exists to praise Nat. His grandmother recalls her husband as a strong man just like Nat after he's been whipped, his mother expresses her pride in him after killing their master, the mother of their master is given credit for giving Nat the word of the Bible (she's treated as docile and reluctant of her position, despite preventing Nat from reading books \"for white folks\"), and Cherry Ann loves him unconditionally and has a whole hour dedicated to their relationship until she's put through a historically inaccurate rape scene. Not too long after, the same fate goes for the silent character of Esther, who is requested for sex by another slave owner at a party. I feel it necessary to note that the argument over whether she should be brought to the man is between Turner, Esther's husband Hark, and Isaiah, not Esther herself. The irony of Parker playing a man who avenges the rape of two women given his own history with the crime (the source for his aforementioned controversy that clouds the film) is not lost. It leaves an uncomfortable feeling that this was his and McGianni's response to that period in his life; an alleged rapist showing his care for rape victims as a kind of absolution. It's one of the more sinister ulterior motives of a movie that advertises something well-meaning, or at least influential. Looked at transparently, it’s an endorsement for Nate Parker to serve as your perfect personal rebel.\n\nFor a project Nate Parker claimed to work on for seven years, there's an inadvertent lack of passion in the story of *The Birth of a Nation* than a nagging need to play this iconic figure in a film controlled by no one but himself, dressed up in a title that claims reappropriation for notoriety. I could also break down the flaws in its filmmaking, but that's another discussion entirely. It stands through this write-up that *The Birth of a Nation* is more concerned with flaunting the chops of its creator, all to achieve that grand validation of awards recognition. That recognition will never be seen though, due to the artist's past coming to light, but most effectively, the simple fact that he made an uninteresting piece of art out of an interesting subject.",

        "text": "First off, I would like to thank everyone that commented on my previous post \"What film do you have an unpopular opinion of?\". It was one of my first posts and really brought a smile to my face when I saw my phone blow up with comments.\n\nThat being said, I noticed that ~90% of comments were about someone being down on a popular film that most think is good. While all those comments are valid, I think a better way to share unpopular opinions is to defend a film you love that most people think is bad. \n\nFrightMakesRight posted a brilliant comment about this in the previous post. It read:\n\nIt's a shame that everyone's go-to unpopular opinion is admitting that they don't like a popular film or filmmaker. I think it's a lot more interesting and uncommon to praise things that might be overlooked from a critical perspective than to denounce things that are generally well-liked. I think Sansho the Bailiff is kinda boring and the much-beloved HBO miniseries Olive Kitteridge is probably one of my most hated films ever, but I don't think those are particularly interesting opinions. As such, I submit the following opinion for review:\n\nFinal Destination 4 (properly known as The Final Destination) is very, very good.\n\nI was very surprised when I watched it to find out that I actually really really enjoyed the film for a lot of reasons. I had a lot of expectations about what kind of films the Final Destination films were, and the only one that properly met those expectations was the fourth entry. It gets derided by critics for having \"no plot\", but I actually find this to work towards the film's favor. Rather than getting bogged down in the mechanics of death-as-a-villain or over-explaining the conceit of the film, it takes it as a given that you understand and accept the premise at face value. Whether this is because it's the fourth entry in a franchise or just because director David R. Ellis is a ridiculously efficient storyteller doesn't matter really, since it ends up setting the tone for a campy, tongue-in-cheek race-against-time type thriller.\n\nThe most famous aspect of the series, the death scenes, are the shining star of the film. As mentioned above, due to the fact that this is the fourth entry in a series and is being directed by a stunt coordinator, these death scenes are the biggest focus. What's even better, the rube goldberg aspect of the death scenes comes about pretty naturally as a creative extension of the increasingly complex death scenes in the series. The fact that David R. Ellis is able to create simultaneous plot threads for inanimate objects while maintaining continuity of space and time in a way that is fully understandable to an audience is a testament to his abilities as a director.\n\nThe special effects are pretty dreadful and go way out of their way to make it obvious that it was shot in 3-D, but these minor trappings didn't really take that much away from the experience for me. It was all about laughs, gruesome deaths, and fast-paced fun and it delivered on all fronts.\n\nI credit the abysmal reviews it got to the fact that people were tired of the franchise, tired of 3-D, upset by the lack of Tony Todd, finally getting old enough to recognize hokey acting (which is present in all five films by the way) but not old enough to appreciate it, or all of the above.\n\nMy task for you is: Defend a film you like that most people find bad. You must be able to back it up and not just say it's good and that others are wrong. ",

        "text": "[I posted this on MovieDetals, it was suggested there I post here. Mods, if this doesn't foster any discussion, please delete and my apologies] \n\nI almost want to call this person a \"non-obvious Cassandra\" but I think \"Greek Chorus\" may be more more apt. They explicitly reveal the theme, they call out the inciting incident right before it happens, and they reveal the manner of Cage's ultimate deliverance. \n\nEvery time Tom Cruise (Cage) dies in this movie he wakes up at FOB Heathrow, about to be impressed into J-Squad and forced to go into battle. Through his many lives he gets to know his fellow soldiers in J-Squad. Although at first they don't believe him, in at least some of his incarnations they come to believe and trust him- even with their shameful or hidden secrets: Skinner (the football hooligan) used to wet his pants in grade school; \"Ford\" (the American with the football) has secretly assumed the identity of his dead best friend so that his friend's wife keeps getting his checks. These are just some of the secrets they've revealed to Cage before the end. But the one person Cage can't ever seem to convince is Sergeant Farell, no matter how hard he tries.\n\nBefore Cage ever woke up for the first time at FOBH, Sergeant Farell has already received a note telling him all he needed to know about Cage: that Cage is a deserter, and that he would do anything to get out of battle tomorrow. Farell believes this note and it inoculates him from the truth. No matter what Cage says, no matter how much Cage knows, Farell always forces Cage back onto battle.\n\nBut Farell himself reveals to Cage more than he initially lets on. \n\n * Farell lines J-Squad up to recite something to Cage (right before he makes them eat a playing card each) just like Greek Tragedies used to do, all together in a chorus, in the background: that Farell \"dislikes the concept of fate,\" he dislikes it because \"it entertains the notion that our fate is in hands other than own.\" And when Farell calls out, \"Chorus?\" they chant \"**through readiness and discipline we are our masters of our fate.**\" And then he walks directly up to Cage, as he stands there helpless and handcuffed, \"You might call that notion ironic. **But trust me. You'll come around.**\" \n\n * when Farell reveals to Cage that he knows he's a deserter, Farell tells Cage he knows Cage would do \"anything to get out of combat duty tomorrow. **But that's not going to happen. Ever.**\"   \n\n * Farell tells Cage that **\"there's hope for you\"** and before he leaves Cage with J-Squad even tells him **\"I envy you\"** for there is **\"hope  [...] in the form of glorious combat. Battle is the great redeemer. The fiery crucible in which the only true heroes are forged.**\" (Which he has already stated Cage will \"never escape.\") There are two heroes in this movie, both are forged through the crucible of unending combat.   \n\n * On his first exposure to battle, Cage is in the process of fleeing the battlefield when he's collared by Sergeant Farrel and forced to turn back around and soldier on. \"Private Cage! You're going the wrong way! **You're going to miss your moment!\"** Had Cage actually fled, he would still have died, but he wouldn't kill the Alpha, gain his power or go on his hero's journey. Cage would have missed his moment.\n\n * Cage is literally drenched in corrosive Mimic Blood when he first gains his powers. He has to drown himself in order to escape with the knowledge that the dam (toward which they were fighting most of the movie) is nothing but a red herring; and in the end, in order to lead the final- and only really meaningful- battle of the movie, he has to surface from the bottom of the Seine where he's drowning, trapped by the useless shell of his powerless battle armor. Three emergences from immersions, three scenes pivotal scenes of change: the first of ability, the second of knowledge, and the third of resolution. The day before Farell told him, **\"Tomorrow morning you will be baptized. Born again.\"** This is shown to be true.   \n\n * By the final morning, early, Cage has run out of lives and run out of time. He NEEDS to get to Paris immediately. He's seemingly out of options. How does he get himself sent off to Paris? Farell's got his back. Farell says the following sentences back-to-back to J-Squad at the start, **\"He WILL be combat ready at 0600 tomorrow.\" \"I'm making you all personally responsible for his deliverance.\"** By the end Cage is combat ready. And J-Squad do deliver him to the final battlefield in time.\n\nThere's more I may have missed with Farell, and I could write a whole separate post on Rita. But this is what I picked up on.\n",

        "text": "The Death of Stalin, written/directed by Armando Iannucci (Veep) starring Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Buscemi, and Jason Isaacs, follows the top leaders of the Soviet Union as they fight for control after the death of their leader.\n\nThis movie is a hilarious take on a little-known point in history. The actors blend into their roles seamlessly, some of them resembling their real life counterparts. The whole movie is in English and they avoid Russian accents. The director said this allows for more immersion, since you wouldn't hear the accent if you knew the language. \n\nBut the dialogue takes the backseat in this movie. Unlike almost every modern comedy, The Death of Stalin doesn't find its humor in ad-libbed one-liners and jokes. Instead, the humor comes from physical gags and slapstick, which allows for more universal and more memorable comedy. There's a reason Chaplin and Lloyd were so famous having never spoken a word. \n\nI saw an early screening of this 2 weeks ago, and I'm struggling to remember a single line in the movie. This is remarkably different than most other comedies nowadays, where you exit the theater quoting lines in pop culture for the next few years (how many quotes do you know from Anchorman or Hangover?). \n\nInstead, I can vividly remember numerous scenes from Stalin that didn't have a word of dialogue, but crack me up every time: (SPOILERS) \n\n--\n\nAs Stalin dies, he's collapsed on the floor, surrounded by piss. His ministers enter and keep kneeling in the piss, instantly turning a somber moment into slapstick. Even when they manage to lift the body and shuffle to his bedroom, they have to awkwardly roll the body over themselves. Not a word, but I died laughing at the image of men getting their faces squashed by their piss-stained leader all while trying to be respectful. \n\nWhen Stalin's free-spirited son shows up, he quickly causes a ruckus, and seemingly unprovoked, grabs the gun of an officer. They then spend the next 15seconds fighting over the pistol with nothing but grunts. This menial soldier fights for his life against royalty, all while the ministers just roll their eyes. In a Q&amp;A with the director, he said he recognized the comedy on set and told the two to keep struggling and didn't cut for an awkward amount of time. And it worked. With every second that passes, the physical joke gets funnier. \n\nAnd the one scene that could represent the entire movie as a whole, doesn't have a single line. As the body is loaded into the hearse, the ministers stand by their cars respectfully. But since they're all fighting for control, they rush to be the first car in the processional as soon as the body is loaded. All at once, all 8 cars pull out... and get stuck. So they all have to do the (painfully familiar) maneuver of backing up even to let the hearse out first. Everyone can sympathize with the situation, and knowing the character dynamics makes it hilarious. \n\nThere are countless other memorable jokes, from Jason Isaacs slo-mo entrance to Buscemi and Tambor's awkward shuffle around the casket (Iannucci said the only VFX shot in the movie was removing Buscemi's smile from this scene). \n\n--\n\nNormally a joke in a movie relies on some external reference or creative wordplay, but this movie is funnier than any I've seen in years because it entirely relies on situations I'm familiar with played out by characters I can sympathize with.\n\nI believe that being able to block/direct his own writing, allowed Iannucci more control over his comedy. He doesn't write jokes, he creates characters that we can relate to and situations we can recognize, and then he blocks it in a way that you can't help but laugh.\n\nWhat do you think about the use of physical humor?",

After this movie i realised that (although im not religious at all) i am very interested in anything related to religions, but more particularly to faith. I loved how the movie portrayed what religion and faith means to different kinds of people.\n\nToday i watched The Nun's Story (1959) because this year i fell in love madly for Audrey Hepburn, and i started watching her movies. I liked this story too, it wasn't as deep and thorough as Silence, but it was also a very great movie in this category, i think.\n\nSo my question is, can you tell me some other movies similar to these?",

I’ve seen Suspiria by Argento, and while I thought it was good, I felt it to be a bit pretentious, with its only standout merit being the cinematography. I felt the plot was very weak and they could’ve done a better job with the dubbing. I know people tend to prefer Argento because with Suspiria onward he became more “artsy” but I feel Bava deserves more credit. Still need to check out more of their other stuff though.\n\nEdit: Since this is getting more responses than I expected, what do you guys also think of Lucio Fulci?

It seems that David Fincher purposefully places so much Deus Ex machina moments in the film that almost spell it out on capital letters without actually stating the obvious, that the world is happening within a kind of dream. These range from characters and props showing up without rhyme or reason, notwithstanding the implausibility of the main plot thread which if it did take place in a kind of reality would be almost impossible to orchestrate (and in a safe manner so that noone got killed or the police didn't get involved etc). The purpose of this seems to be similar to Inception in that the character is going through a journey of self realization / rebirth, and realizing or seeing the world through a different perspective than before. Di Caprio seems to be trying to reconcile his guilt ridden psyche so that he can look his children in the face, while Douglas is learning how to appreciate the humanity around him instead of being miserly.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nOnly once I watched 'The Game' and 'Inception' with this in mind did I accept the absurd over the top set pieces without criticism, and I actually feel silly for not seeing the deliberate intelligence behind the 'dumb action'.

Now, this would not be something new in film criticism, as we’ve seen that themes tend to be brought on the screen in waves; nevertheless, interpreting movies as part of a linear discussion risk bending and twisting what they really are in favor of certain narratives.\n\nThis said, movies are made by people, and people tend to view the world through the lenses of the society they were born into. This relationship is especially true for sci-fi, whose basic formula is to put the author's idea of humanity in front of a disruption and imagine how it would react to it. \n\nAfter having compared modern sci-fi such as *Annihilation* with classics, I couldn’t help but notice an apparent shift: where past science fiction works often merged personal and social reckoning with an alien invasion, a new social order etc, newer works seem to pursue purely intimate storylines. Facing the problems of the future has become a personal struggle: one against personal sacrifice in *Arrival*, or familiar authority in *10 Cloverfield Lane*, or again the feeling of being just one of many in *Blade Runner 2049*. Compare this with *Stalker*, *Invasion of Body Snatchers* or the original *Blade Runner*, where the source of conflict came from an unjust social order rather **the inability of characters to conform to it**. The difference here is subtle, because even if the final outcome (a confrontation of the single against the many) is the same, there's much to be inferred from where the \"blame\" is put.\n\n**If contemporary sci-fi delights itself more in fiction than science, if it isn't interested in the process leading up to the conflict it portrays, does it mean screenwriters and directors have become less critical of current institutions? Can we interpret it as a \"retreat\" from public debate into introspection?** ",

        "author": "Hopeful_e-vaughn",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/86okf9/pacific_rim_uprising_when_boomboom_action_sequels/",
        "text": "I'm surprised by how much I liked Pacific Rim 2, and genuinely felt it improved on the original in nearly every single way. \n\n\n\n**Sequelitis Be Gone (quick intro to Pacific Rim 1)**\n\n\nIt’s a long standing cliché that sequels are simply not going to be as good as the original. Not even remotely a “rule”, as there are quite a few wonderful sequels that dethrone the original, but it is a rare pedigree for a sequel to obtain. It’s also exceedingly more rare, in my opinion, for an action-genre sequel to outshine its predecessor. \n\n\nInterestingly enough, the director of Pacific Rim 1 (Guillermo Del Toro), holds honors for crafting Blade 2, which I thought was an improvement over Blade 1 in nearly every way (and both are not-so-guilty pleasures for me). Pacific Rim 1 is a pretty great large-scale robot action flick. The genre of Godzilla-esque monsters (called Kaiju in PR1) destroying cities versus human-powered skyscraper robots (called Jaegers in PR1) isn’t huge, but it has enough entries in the genre to identify it as a genre-flick. Leveraging massive scale, ample city carnage, and apocalyptically motivated monsters, it wasn’t off-base to say that Pacific Rim was one of the best of the bunch. \n\n\nDel Toro did a great job with the combat, the world building, and the attention to mechanical-detail and teamwork that stands at the core of what makes a Jaeger operate. This last bit elevates the common action-movie theme of teamwork into a fascinating concept called the neural handshake. In Pacific Rim, the cognitive load of interfacing with a Jaeger is so intense that they must be piloted with two pilots that synchronize not only their movements but also their minds. This small but inventive concept has broad reach and makes for a lot of interesting psychological framings, story-telling opportunities, and even provides ample conflict… not to mention it creates a tangible structure to how important teamwork is in these types of “against all odds” action flicks. \n\n\nPacific Rim one is great. It’s got magnificent action, though it’s clouded in darkness and murkiness of underwater combat. It’s got weight to the Jaegers, which seemingly everyone and myself praised. It’s got rousing speeches and solid character development, and while its infused humor tip-toes the line between camp and cheese, it functions well enough to allow the film to take itself a bit less serious. Tonally, the humor in PR1 is sporadic and a bit inconsistent, but it’s hardly a knock against the film. \nAll of this is important to acknowledge, because impressively, Pacific Rim 2: Uprising, is an improvement over nearly every single element of the first movie. I watched Pacific Rim 1 just a week prior to the sequel, and Director Steven S. DeKnight (who made of my absolutely favorite shows, Spartacus) manages to nail the feeling of glorified and visceral action, and earn himself a coveted place as a director who understands what makes Pacific Rim 1 so good and somehow created a sequel that cranks the dial up to 11. \nTruly, Pacific Rim: Uprising has better action, more diverse character development, a more cohesive and tonally consistent infusion of humor, a continued expansive of world building, and several lil plot twists and gotchyas that actually caught me by surprise. \nAll in all, if you’re looking for a BOOM-BOOM action movie, this might be one of the most satisfying. And if you’re looking specifically for Huge-Scale Rock-em-Sock-em Robotics, this is the best of the bunch. \n\n\n**Filmmaking as If Michael Bay Was Actually Talented**\n\n\nAction movies are often considered stupid, brainless, explosive messes. Sometimes it’s ok to sit back and just allow your eyes to glaze over at the onslaught of overstimulation your retinas process. Sometimes… it doesn’t work, like at all. The Transformers movies, and indeed, Michael Bay, are intangible linked to the notion that bombastic action movies are god-awful. \n\n\nInterestingly enough, Michael Bay has a very clear and often impressive cinematic style. While he can’t often create a cohesive and well-characterized film with actual good humor, he certainly has a knack for action. Known for constant dynamic movement, Bayisms are a directing style that SHOULD work really well with intense action flicks. What we have here in PC:R is a director that not only emulated Bay’s style better than Bay himself, he actually creates a more understandable flow to action, scale, and motherfucking badassery. I won’t lie, I fucking fist-pumped the air in excitement a couple times while watching this flick. There are just so many badass moments and impressive cinematography. \n\n\nWild action simply has no impact when you over-edit, poorly frame, or don’t know how to pace the action out. I talk about this as an issue in my Black Panther review, and it’s often an issue in Transformers movies. Here, in PR:U, the action is always understandable and often badass. \n\n\nThere’s a wonderful chase-scene peppered with adorable jokes (Scrapper vs. the initial patrolling Yeager), an incredible mech vs. mech solo battle, and a city-demolishing finale that is splatterific and bloody in all the right ways. \n\n\nA disappointing knock on the first PR is that while it had a plethora of weaponry and missiles utilized, effective weapons like the sword are used a single time and then backpacked. Here, we see electric whips, gravity tethers, swords, plasma canons, and a spiked mace. If you like fantasy combat upscaled action, this shit does action right. \n\n\n\n**World Building and Attention to Detail**\n\n\n Unexpectedly, the movie builds out the world much more than PR1 did. It more heavily frames the Jaegars as giant celebrities, shows the destruction of cities and their aftermath a bit more than before, and even has an introduction that walks us through a rusted-out Jaegar. The mechanical details gorgeously on display, factory production lines building out giant machines, and a military presence that feels very alive, there are plenty of excellent moments. \n\nThose that want a more empathetic view of the Kaiju may be pleased to see how the film handles its main conflict, and it does a great job of veiling where its going. What I suspected the main problem would be ended up tripping me up a bit, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see that the trailers purposefully deceived me in regards to which characters would be front and center. \n\n\nI was very happy to see Mako return, and the scientists from the first PR return, playing an important role. \n\n\nOne of my favorite things about the PR franchise is the focus on dual-piloting, which creates a sense of control and autonomy in the Jaegars that could be easy to misunderstand. The combination of absolutely riveting and polished UI (I fucking LOVE seeing complex User Interfaces in movies) and holograms in the cockpit of the Jaeger create a sense of situational awareness for the pilots that makes these machines actually feel agile and controllable. It’s these types of details that can elevate a punchy action movie into something electric. \n\n**What’s Not to Like?**\n\n\nI feel like I’m absolutely glowing in this review. Like, I didn’t expect to like this movie as much as I did. Reflecting back on it, it’s easy to praise for its incredible action, the better-than-expected acting, and the charming humor. The kid actors pulled off their shit incredibly well, with my only identifiable grievance in the story or narrative might be a contrived conflict between our young heroine Amara Namani and the Russian Cadet Viktoria. It’s sensible and sound, though doesn’t feel like it has much resolution or purpose. \n\n\nI also realize I don’t have a sense of the music, like at all. I usually notice a score, but I can’t say any single moment stood out to me. Listening to the soundtrack while writing this review, it feels serviceable. Orchestral strings, war drums, and synth’d electronica feel appropriate. \n\n\nOther than that, this movie feels like an incredibly well-constructed action flick. Most actors nail their roles, and surprisingly, Charlie Day’s off-kilter humorous delivery works really well as his character develops in the story. John Boyega is wonderfully charming and I liked him in this much more than in Star Wars, and Scott Eastwood feels fine in this flick if only to make fun of his dashing good looks and rigidity. He works well as a foil to our protagonist’s rebellious nature. \n\n\nThe plot and story structure were honestly way better than an action movie tends to establish. High attention to detail, low Deus Ex Machina plot devices, and an attempt to foreshadow big reveals.\n\n\nAt one point, a Jaeger has to strap a high-powered rocket to itself, and instead of holding on tightly (which is feasible enough to believe in a film like this), the movie goes out of its way to ensure they weld the rocket to the Jaeger, which in turn creates momentum for what happens next. Shit like that is stuff that is easily critiquable in other films, yet PR:U nails this. \n\n\nYet we’re looking at a very low Rottentomatoe score for this sequel to Pacific Rim. Hovering around 45% on RT, I’m surprised to see this nailed to the wall while the plethora of Marvel movies are praised into the 90%, and the horrendous Justice League is only 4% below PR:U. Now, I don’t normally give too shits about my dissenting opinion for films, but even when attempting to be cynical about this flick, I’m surprised by how sound it feels all the way through. \n\nIt is, of course, a hardcore action flick. I wouldn’t go as far as to call it dumb, and the script and dialogue actually make it sound a lot more inspired and smarter than it is. Yah, shit, man, this was great. \n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nAn improvement over Pacific Rim 1 in every conceivable way. Better, more potent, extravagantly scaled-up and diverse action peppered with satisfyingly well-framed and easy-on-the-eyes cinematography. Fleshed out characters that are well-acted, have a solid script, and inject a consistent humor into the film (unlike the often campy original). A variety of unexpected gotchya moments, a fleshed out world with added lore, and a problem solving plot-momentum that doesn’t feel phoned in. This is the type of spectacle that Transformers hopes it can grow up to be. \n.\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n\n**Recommended for fans of this genre?** Yes! Gundam-style spectacle doesn’t get all that much better than this. Any fans of intense “dumb” action should appreciate this. Mechanics porn, UI porn, or monster movie destruction porn may also fit the bill. \n\n\n**Recommended for non-fans of this genre?** \n\nYes. I think this movie hits all the narrative and emotional beats it tries to hit. The action is incredible easy to understand and always hard-hitting and always pretty fucking epic. It’s a joy to watch, and I can recommend it to a variety of demographics. Even those that may not have seen Pacific Rim 1.   \n\n\n**Semi-arbitrary Score: 9.0/10**\n*Semi-arbitrary Action Movie Score: 9.3/10*\n\n\ne-vaughn\n\n\n\n",

Even sequels to films that have characters form a relationship usually have something happen to the relationship that requires them to get back together again, or the relationship is omitted. As an example, in both Captain America and Thor, the protagonist forms a romantic relation, but in the sequels the romantic relationship isn't featured at all. \n\nWhy are stages of relationships other than the beginning so rarely featured? Is it because it's harder to act or write them? Is it because it's less engaging? What are your thoughts?",

        "text": "(Note: this is my first essay I’ve written for this sub. Just wanted to show my thoughts on one of my favorite movies. Read and enjoy)\n\nRian Johnson’s filmmaking resumé seems to grow by the second. He has made one of the greatest time-travel films in years with LOOPER, he directed some of TV’s greatest drama’s greatest episodes across BREAKING BAD’s five-season run, and he has gifted the STAR WARS franchise with its most enthralling entry in 35 years. However, despite his rapid ascension into the spotlight of popular cinema, I’ve seen a surprising widespread disregard for Johnson’s roots, which is a missed opportunity for many to experience one of the greatest neo-noir films to ever be made. BRICK, Johnson’s first film, is a unabashedly enthusiastic masterpiece, in which Johnson plays with the American film noir conventions that so obviously inspired his cinephilia.\n\nMade on a $475,000 budget of which the bulk was donated by friends and family, BRICK explores a familiar story in an unfamiliar setting (at least, unfamiliar for the genre). The murder of a young woman and an assortment of drug kingpins and enforcers are not foreign elements in the novels of Dashiell Hammett (Johnson’s greatest influence in terms of BRICK) or Raymond Chandler and the classic films starring Humphrey Bogart as an unsentimental detective on the rough streets of Los Angeles. But these obligatory story elements only strengthen the tone of the movie: it is a classic noir film, but in a high-school setting. Rather than the over-the-hill heroes and twenty-something heiresses as our principal protagonists, we have fresh-faced students to root for. \n\nEvery archetype is present: Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is our detective, Brain (Matt O’Leary) is the knowledgeable partner and informant, Pin (Lukas Haas) and Tug (Noah Fleiss) are our respective boss and enforcer, Emily (Emilie de Ravin) is the innocent young woman that gets in too deep, and there are (count ‘em) TWO femme fatales: Kara (Meagan Good) and Laura (Nora Zehetner). And yes, these characters are based around decades-old  outlines employed by countless crime writers in order to mimic the most successful of these stories in hopes of easy profit. But it’s the setting that Johnson places them in that completely transforms them into tired plot devices into vibrant characters.\n\nBRICK speaks the language of classic film, both literally and thematically. Even though these characters are young students attending a California high school, most speak with the quick-witted and noir lingo that populated the vernacular of cinema’s greatest detective stories, from THE THIN MAN to THE BIG SLEEP to THE MALTESE FALCON. This idea certainly has gimmick potential, but Johnson plays it totally straight, with each calculated response delivered with the deadly seriousness of the contemplations of troubled youth. It is with these solemn regard for the tropes of the genre that BRICK becomes a tribute, rather than a parody. When Brendan says that he’s “got knives in my eyes” without a knowing smirk or junkie Dode tells him to “leave the low life to the low lifers and dangle” without irony, Johnson is bringing you deeper and deeper into the fantastical world of classic film that he undoubtedly dreamed of during his own adolescent years. \n\nUpon closer inspection, however, the world and characters of BRICK have another layer. While Brendan, Pin, Dode, and most of the other principle characters of the film (even one of the adults!) speak in this detective shoptalk, not every one of them is committed to this kind of speech. In an early scene, when Brendan speaks to his ex-girlfriend and eventual murder victim Emily on a pay phone, both drop the colloquialisms in lieu of a more relatable and awkward conversational tone before their conversation is rudely interrupted by the aforementioned antagonists. Later, during a confrontation between Pin and Brendan in an informal setting that comes nowhere close to the shadows that both prefer to operate from within, both abandon their lingo yet again. These small scenes remind us that this world isn’t a fantasy or alternate reality in which students speak like Bogart and Bacall; they are simply children playing cops and robbers. Brendan, obviously lonely and heartbroken, copes with his frustrating and tragic life like Spade or Marlowe would: by being cold towards those around him and pursuing the case with as little emotion as he can muster. The Pin, with his unbelievable flamboyant style of crime, is, when considered carefully, a delusional child as well. \n\nAnd why wouldn’t these kids turn to Hammett for solace? Each one is stuck in the often mind-numbing experience of adolescence, so tired of monotony that they create danger and peril for their own pleasure. The stakes of BRICK are real, but they are the product of children taking their love of film noir and detective fiction a bit too far.\n\nBut even though the film noir environment of BRICK may be a product of its characters’ thirst for excitement, it is also a product of Rian Johnson’s passion for such stories. His love of classic film is pervasive throughout the film, permeating every frame, exchange, and character archetype. Without knowledge of Johnson’s influences, BRICK is nonetheless an exciting mystery complemented by some remarkable performances. But being in on the joke makes BRICK a revelatory experience; a film that wears its inspirations on its sleeve and then runs with them, created by a director so in love with film noir that his enthusiasm reflects off every carefully orchestrated shot. \n\nSo maybe it isn’t such a surprise that BRICK hasn’t caught on. It is a film for film buffs, by a film buff. Unlike Tarantino’s cinephilia, which is ever-present but not a requirement when it comes to great appreciation of his films, Johnson’s love of classic cinema is essential to the appreciation of his first film. Those with love for Johnson’s other work should definitely seek out this film. Just make sure you’ve done your homework.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/86jnfi/locke_2013_selfsacrifice_and_moral_absolutism_in/",
        "text": "(Disclaimer; This is pretty disjointed.  In addition to this being my first time writing a lengthy analysis of a film, I wrote it between 1 and 3 AM as a way to stay awake until an early morning flight.  It was also originally much more broad in scope, touching on themes of fiction's use as a way to instill moral values in a society.  However, I realized halfway through that I don't know anything about plays, and that to write on such a topic without knowledge of the one mentioned in the film (Waiting for Godot) would be a tremendous oversight.)\n\nThe film Locke seems to be infamously divisive; you’re either bored to shit, or manage to become enthralled by the hypothetical pouring of concrete.  It’s difficult to defend or disparage either side of the argument; ultimately, a movie with such a simple narrative and framework is going to fail to engross a significant proportion of viewers, and it can’t be faulted for that.  However, I do think there is at least one aspect of the movie’s manic disdain for the cinematic status quo which is unique and noteworthy enough to make it recommended viewing.  That particular piece of the movie is the way Locke’s fatal flaw is treated.\n\n\nLocke has an apt name; its particular cinematic niche is defined by being locked in place, usually with a single character, or a cast confined to a single location.  Generally, in such films, the narrative thrust centers around a, “breaking point,”, the point where radical shifts in a character’s self-image and superficial image become inevitable.  How characters skirt, recover from, or fall prey to this aspect of themselves is generally the crux of the story, and is how a conventional structure can be derived in a situation mostly devoid of external forces.  These internal conflicts are rooted in a trope as old as tragedy, the hero’s fatal flaw.  Many movies similar to Locke play with this idea, substituting the hubris of Ariadne or the ignorance of Oedipus with traits commonly seen as virtuous, or benign, in order to heighten the tragedy.  However, what makes Locke unique in the microcosm of “single-state films” is the metaarchetypical aspect of its protagonist’s flaw.  Locke’s flaw, breaking point, and subsequently the entire structure of the film, can be seen as indicators of the importance of moral greyness in developing a societally useful ethic.  \n\n\nThe logical starting point for this claim is one of the three conflicts central to the movie; particularly, the most abstract and specific one, as that makes it the obvious place to nest metaphor.  Concrete.  The film’s most immediately evident imagery is its solidity and reliability.  Ivan Locke refers to others and is referred to as “solid” multiple times.  His primary motivations can be seen as rigidity and normality; defying the legacy of his spineless father, building a literal foundation through intense regimen, and maintaining domesticity at his home.  He does this while sticking to a well-defined path, constantly reassuring himself of the reliability of his expectations with platitudinous repetition.  Essentially, Locke seems to mirror the very foundation whose creation he is the architect of.  This metaphor extends so far as the film’s structure; Ivan is the primary load-bearing element.  Tom Hardy is the only actor in the opening credits, and indeed the only face seen.  \n\n\nBeyond the immediate comparison, characterizing Locke by such a cursory metric falters.  While he is the center of the movie, his load is no more important than that felt by the characters outside of the car, dwelling in the three primary conflicts.  Bethan is feeling her hope for love and meaning be quashed just as Locke is; Donal is just as culpable for the possible failure of the historic pour as him; Katrina and the two boys are being forced out of their comfortable domesticity as much as Ivan.  All four gates have to be checked; all four points of tragedy in the plot bear an important load.  The fact that we happen to be accompanying the one with the grandest view, the most culpability, and the widest breadth of conflict doesn’t diminish those we aren’t intimately connected to.  Locke is simply a part of the story; though he’s our vehicle into it, his contribution to the larger framework can’t be assumed to be the only one with meaning. \n\n\nThis second layer isn’t necessarily deeper or truer; both are extant and impactful.  However, the fascinating dichotomy, and the relevance to the original point, lies in their relation to Locke’s decision making throughout the movie.  Locke is aware of the motivational spectre of his father, and he’s cognitive of the metaphorical significance of a foundation.  He’s intimately aware of the constructed ethics he’s acting under the influence of, but these are philosophies he has built and holds dear, and can consciously explain and use as rationalization.  As such, Locke possesses a unique clairvoyance among tragic protagonists.  He can see and rationalize his decisions through the lens of the first characterization, which is an abnormal level of cognizance for a tragic character.  However, for Locke this is the only available lens, as he possesses a fundamental oedipism towards the secondary ramifications of his philosophy, leading to his tragically narcissistic situation.  Unwilling to do right by any rationale or ethic except his own, his rigid self-characterization leads to the suffering of everyone around him.  Rather than choosing one focus, and minimizing emotional turmoil in one of his three conflicts, Locke tries to accomplish everything.  This masturbatory selflessness is his crucifixion, flagellation for the sins of the father, but there’s no redemption in it; rather, placing such burden on himself only increases the load on others.  \n\n\nWhile the fundamental flaws which cause this tragedy aren’t unique, their interplay with the narrative framework and the metacognition of Locke is.  Locke is a deeply intelligent character; his actions possess a well-established logic and exhibit a certain practical genius.  But as pointed out by Bethan, Locke isn’t well versed in theatrical tragedy.  His driving motivation is free of the broader societal truths espoused in fiction, instead being based only on legitimate personal pain and a desire to avoid the mistakes of his father.  As such, even though it’s well thought out, strongly grounded in reality, and generally seems commendable, it’s flawed.  The intimate and personal nature make it a failed ethic by any metric which doesn’t focus exclusively on Locke.  Therein lies the film’s core commentary; the failure of the moral absolute as a basis for society.  Society as a whole condemns absentee fathers, but more deeply than absentees it abhors abandonment.  Locke possesses a cognitive moral absolutism; he is aware that he vilifies his father above all else, and is aware of his adherence to a philosophy of rigidity.  However, his ignorance of tragic situations outside of his own life and his own personal morally defining events make him unable to recognize that these absolutes don’t align with the deeper societal consensus about responsibility.  \n\n\nLocke is a “good” man.  He is honest, tries to take responsibility for his actions, and do right by all parties regardless of his own emotional burden.  But this savior complex is not what society expects of him.  Society would prefer he take responsibility for the two legitimate children and the wife over the bastard and the loveless consort.  Society would rather he raise a monument than a child.  Society, above all, desires for him not to abandon what IT has assigned and recognized as his responsibilities, rather than his own whims.  Even if that whim is a human life.  The film doesn’t pass judgement on this societal trend; rather, it portrays it as akin to the trolley problem.  Locke could pull the lever and have it hit Bethan, rather than Katrina and the building.  But his own strict morality, coupled with a lack of exposure to societally truthful fiction, both tie him to the track and render him unable to rationally make the choice which would lead to only Bethan being harmed.  In fact, this exact choice happens twice; the mistake which catalyzes the movie can be seen through the same framework.  \n\n\nThe downfall of the righteous man is in and of itself a trope.  But the film’s delivery of the deeper truth behind this is what makes it unique.  In Locke, good is not defeated by evil or ignorance, good is an unsatisfactory compromise between evil and ignorance.  Self-sacrifice isn’t universally commendable, it’s self-aggrandizing and unempathetic.  Societal norms are neither commendable nor pointless; they’re morally grey fitness trade-offs.  All of these meanings would be absent were Locke not aware of his own strict adherence to his philosophy of rigidity.  His metacognizance allows analysis of his actions beyond simple analysis of his past.  In service of this, we’re placed in a narrative framework where all of the action is driven by Ivan’s choices, and he is the only person we can see and empathize with face-to-face.  We have no choice but to initially associate with the same self-sacrificial worldview as him.  His morality becomes the baseline by which judge the characters he interacts with, as we are separated from their perspectives by the dehumanizing effects of technology.  Only once we realize that Ivan’s plan is deeply flawed, and will inevitably bring pain to his family, is a deeper analysis of the actual logic of his actions mandatory.  The film plays this duality beautifully, creating a rich contrast of societal expectations and self-perceived goodness.  ",

        "text": "A couple of months ago I decided to start reviewing every film I watch. This began very difficultly as I struggled to properly articulate just what I was trying to say (which was one of the reasons for starting this mission). Now however it has become far easier and often the review 'flows' well and I feel I'm able to get my points across. The main objective for this was improving my ability in quite simply explaining what I did and didn't like about a film. I now also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCLiQjxOLiL8t8hwl5iB3mA) where I post my reviews. \n\nWhen I first started reviewing movies I did what I think most people do, which is structuring your review into different categories. For example, starting off my talking about the acting, then the cinematography, then the music etc.\n\nBut as I started to improve in getting my thoughts on paper I came to realize I was handicapping myself by restricting the movies I was reviewing into specific categories to be assessed by. You can't review all movies in the same way. And let's be honest, moving from point to point and touching on all the general things like music, acting etc can make for a pretty boring review.\n\nI looked at my inspirations (Rober Ebert and Mark Kemode to name a few) and noticed a lack of structure or pattern between their reviews - they pretty much just talked about whatever they wanted to talk about. And that's what I decided to do when reviewing a film. I've often foudn the reviews I enjoy a lot tend to only talk about one or two things and go quite deep into it rather that gloss over 10 points. If I loved, say for example a horror film like It Follows, and I loved it for the cool concept and creepy monster, I talk about the cool concept and creepy monster. If I don't feel the need to mention the acting, the music or whatever I won't, and will just stick to what I want to talk about.\n\nFor example the last review I posted on this subreddit for 3 Billboards all I talked about was the characters and the theme of anger and very little else, because that is what interested me and by going through a checklist I would bore and restrict myself, the film, and all those reading the review. \n\nSo to summarize, I've come to a stage where I pretty much have no structure in my reviews, talking about whatever it is in the film that interested me. What I wanted to ask is - when you review a movie, do you follow a pattern or a structure? If so what is it? \n",

It's surreal, lovely and god bless \tChristopher Doyle for his neon-stylistic cinematography. I hope some of you can help. Contemporary directors are welcome aswell.",

That being said, I haven't fallen in love with one of his films. Alphaville, the one I've liked the most so far, had some pretty strange and almost hilarious scenes at the end that felt cheap and lazy. I was wondering what everyone else's thoughts were on him. He strikes up such heavy emotions when people talk about his movies. ",

        "text": "The Ritual is a psychological horror in which we witness nightmares conceived within the heart of fear. Come, as we take a shortcut through the woods of theme &amp; symbolism...  \n  \n**The INITIATION**  \n  \nWe begin in a pub with a group of aging male friends, discussing their next holiday together. Luke wants to steer the vacation towards debauchery. The group is hesitant: \"*Yeah it's not like we're 21 anymore.*\" Robert, the family man, instead suggests hiking the King's Trail between Sweden &amp; Norway - seeking to \"*test himself, with a challenge*\", \"*one with history*\".  \n  \n*************************************************************  \n  \n**The CATALYST**  \n  \nLeaving the bar, Luke ropes in Robert to grab more booze at a liquor store.   \n  \nLuke, unhappy with the proposed direction of their next outing: \"*You know when we meet up it's getting harder to have a good time. Shame what's become of you,*\" (implying Robert's being married with children). The lights flicker.  \n  \n**The rest of the film's horrific events are set in motion by cowardice and a wedding ring.**  \n  \nHearing muffled whimpers, they turn around to see a woman bleeding on the floor. Two men with blades burst through the back room; Luke slithers away and watches from afar as Robert faces the thieves alone.  The men steal Robert's wallet, his watch, and attempt on his wedding ring. Luke struggles indecisively to intervene, cowering with liquor in hand.  \n  \nUnwilling to give up his ring, the men take everything from Robert, including his life.  \n  \n**This dreamlike vision of a scene reappears throughout the film in various contexts, as if stalking Luke.**  \n  \nWe cut sharply to Luke waking up, as if from dreaming; amidst hiking the King's Trail in tribute to the late Robert.  \n  \n*************************************************************  \n  \n**The DESCENT**  \n  \nThe friends perform a brief vigil for Robert. \"*He was a good man, the best of us. Should never have happened, but it did.*\" In his memory, they each take a swig from a flask, and *pour out the rest*.  \n  \nAttempting to return to base camp, the group is delayed by injury and stormy weather. They decide to take a shortcut through deep wood. This begins what can only be described as a slow descent into madness.  \n  \n*************************************************************  \n  \n**The SACRIFICE**  \n  \nThe liquor store features in Luke's recurring nightmares, which begin to blur between wake &amp; sleep. As we lurk deeper into Luke's psyche, the liquor store memory transplants into the woods, invaded by forest growth &amp; the shape-shifting demon god.  \n  \nWhy is Robert's death the focal point of the film? Reading the scene as symbolic:  \n  \nThe junkies are Luke's personal demons of hedonic pleasure whom take up his money and time (wallet and watch), strip his potential for commitment (wedding ring), and murder the symbolic Father (Robert).  \n  \nBeneath this violence lies an injured dying woman, the symbolic Mother. These victims of a man's fear of commitment are the metaphorical death of Father, Mother, and by extension - Family.  \n  \nLiquor is the symbol for Luke's inability to mature out of an eternal \"lad's holiday\"; the Liquor Store is the Source. The robbery/murder is Luke's inner struggle, likely ending a previous relationship at the crossroads of commitment and perpetual hedonism, paralyzing Luke with regret.  \n  \n**Luke's fear of commitment haunts him as a demon god within the dark woods of his soul.**  \n  \n*************************************************************  \n  \n**The DEMON**  \n  \nThe god appears as a giant demonic deer intertwisted with two human forms, yellow eyes feeding upon fear through a vaginal void. The bastard child of Loki, a shapeshifting Jotun of chaos. Nameless, this ancient god is the unholy incarnate of the union of marriage from the perspective of male fear.  \n  \nWhile dreaming, Luke sees his blood (life force) inside a bottle of vodka, and wakes up with his chest marked by the demon god as a potential convert. The undying cult who worships this god claim they are free from pain and death, and yet they live in ceaseless terror as they sacrifice married men to the demon's hunger.  \n  \nTellingly, during Dom's sacrifice, the monster appears as his wife Gale - The Wife as the symbolic Monster. Luke's friends are being claimed one by one into the institution of marriage, and he is blaming the wives. From Luke's perspective, marriage appears as a major sacrifice...of freedom, settling with one woman, a narrowing of life constrained by family. For someone married to the party life and fast losing friends, that *is* horror.  \n  \n*************************************************************  \n  \n**The REDEMPTION**  \n  \nSetting fire to the demon's church, Luke is forced by the demon to submit in prayer and worship. On his knees, a vision of Robert imbues Luke with the courage to stand and fight, ultimately escaping the demon's wood. The demon god survives to prey on the fear of others for eternity.  \n  \nIn a trial of psyche, Luke completes a nightmare vision quest through the King's Trail to become King - master of his own fear. Through metamorphosis, Luke has achieved the ideal of Robert: ready to be the committed Husband, the responsible Father, the man of Family.  \n  \nFrom devotee of hedonist freedom; to champion of the historied tradition of parental responsibility...  \n  \n*************************************************************  \n  \n**The RITUAL**  \n  \nEarly on, Luke &amp; friends discover the buried remnants of a camp from 1984 - perhaps the year of Luke's birth, in which his own Father mastered the trials &amp; chose to settle down with a Family. *Hiking the King's Trail* is thus an archetypal ritual; experienced throughout time in these ageless woods.  \n  \nThoughts?",

        "text": "&gt; These expectations have been sculpted, one chip of Hollywood's chisel after another, in tens of thousands of films. The last thing we expect is… what would probably actually happen. They share loneliness. \n\n&gt;[Roger Ebert  - Great Movie: Lost in Translation](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-lost-in-translation-2003)\n\n---\n\nRomance is one of the biggest disconnects between real life and films: love at first sight, the meet cute, and eventually the big kiss. Elements of these exist in real life, but honestly, these are very watered-down generalizations of how love happens for most people.\n\nLost in Translation is a very complex film from a variety of standpoints. One of the most interesting ways to look at LiT is to see it as a counterpoint to \"hollywood love.\" Let's look at a few in depth.\n\nFirst and foremost, Bob &amp; Charlotte don't meet for the first third of the movie. We understand who they are individually. On the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_Translation_\\(film\\)) page for Lost in Translation, it defines Bob Harris as an aging film star. Let's stop right there - that does sound like a typical quirky romance character. But the distinction is, he's not played like a stereotype. If you were to get the average /r/TrueFilm reader to define Bob, they'd probably talk about how his character *feels*: washed up, tired out, uncertain - the *why* of the character instead of the *what*. There are only three scenes that focus on Bob as an actor: the Suntory whiskey acting, the photo shoot, and the talk show, and they're all focused on how Bob feels out of place.\n\nCharlotte is similar - she's quiet and uncertain. Instead of us seeing her go through a breakup or something overly dramatic, we see the bit of hurt she feels from her husband's gravitation to Kelly. And unlike every other romantic female lead, *she's not looking for love.* She thought she was, she got married, and now she's just as lost as she was.\n\nAnd together, they're an odd duo. There's definitely a weird age gap going on, they're at totally different places in their lives, yet even more strangely, their chemistry is perfect. In the bar, Charlie Brown's place, or during the famous hand/foot exchange, they really seem to understand each other. There's the scene in the movie where Bob swears Charlotte smiled at him in the elevator, but Charlotte swears they met at the bar. And just like that, Coppola kills both the *meet cute* and the *love at first sight* in one swing.\n\nFinally, I think there's a case to be made that Bob &amp; Charlotte don't even fall in love. They come to a deep mutual understanding about themselves, their lives, and each other. The whisper at the end is perfect, because the audience's notion of love is so subjective that each member can fill in their own blank of what happens next. ",

        "text": "Before I start, let me just say what a fantastic movie this was. The play at the beginning mirroring the father's selfish artistic indulgence was genius and the ending line provided a miniature feeling of beauty in the face of a heartbreaking familial disintegration. I can't believe it's taken me this long to delve into Bergman. \n\nThat being said, I am having some trouble understanding the part where Karin, in her penultimate schizophrenic episode, sees God as a spider that tries to penetrate her. I went online and read an essay that used the fact that spiders are usually linked to Satan. Using this, he concludes that God is not Satan but that it is something beyond our understanding and thus subverts what we think is infallible logic. This provides the means for the father's final lines (\"God is love, love is God\"), which essentially states that the anchor to stay in this reality is not belief in a being we can't understand, but rather in interpersonal relationships. \n\nI think this is a satisfactory explanation but I feel it doesn't explain how the spider tries to penetrate Karin. That degree of sexuality must somehow connect to the other acts of sex committed in the movie, whether it was Karin orgasming by herself or committing incest (implied) with her brother Minus. I've tried to think about connecting all of these aspects and the best I can do is that even if love is the one thing that keeps us all together and makes life worth living, it can still become perverted to a degree that it destroys the natural laws that govern the world. As such, some people simply aren't meant to exist happily in our world, a fact that becomes apparent with Karin's exit to the asylum at the end of the movie. \n\nDoes anyone have any other theories about this metaphor? Any responses would be greatly appreciated. \n\n",

        "text": "You might read this list and think, he likes a lot of movies, and you would be right. I do. Also, there is a self-selection bias at play, I generally see films I believe I will enjoy, or I set my expectations accordingly. Ultimately I frequently find something to appreciate. Looking forward to any discussions this might spark.\n\nThe Best:\n\n\n\"Baby Driver\"\n\nIt’s Kubrickian in its precision, Tarantinoesque in its love of cinema pastiche, and yes, Edgar Wrightian in its propulsion and joy. Baby Driver is a jukebox musical with car chases. It might be his best movie yet. What about Spacey? What about him. I don’t want to talk about it.\n\n\"Blade Runner 2049\"\n\nThe original “Blade Runner” is, of course, a classic. It’s also messy, dated, and (un)intentionally misogynistic. Denis Villeneuve has one hell of a batting average, and with his Blade Runner he is now forever cemented as a “great” filmmaker. Not only is it one of the most beautifully photographed movies ever, each image directly supports the emotion and story. It’s more than a worthy successor, it might even surpass the original with its more satisfying and complete narrative.\n\n\"Dunkirk\"\n\nThis is the kind of movie Christopher Nolan should always make: nearly dialogue free, reliant on tension and powerful visuals, and immaculately constructed. Despite its length and ambition I was with it every step and beat. It truly captures the essence of “cinematic” with all its positive connotations.\n\n\"Get Out\"\n\nHoly shit Jordan Peele! The hype was at a fever pitch for “Get Out” by the time it was released in The Netherlands, and it did not disappoint. Dark, tense, hilarious, and oh so satisfying. Not terribly scary, but enthralling and thrilling. The twists surprised me, the shocks were felt, and the performances were some of the best this year. I love that sensation of weirdness and uncertainty seeping into the edges, and if you didn’t like it, you know what, yes, you’re probably racist. A highwater mark for social conscious horror. I can’t wait to see what Jordan does next.\n\n\"Good Time\"\nThis felt different. Truly, utterly, different, in a great, fun, and visceral way. It’s legitimately gritty, and “authentic.” Robert Pattison, with all his Twilight baggage, disappears into his role of a twitchy, wiry, despicable, but compelling protagonist. It barely stops to breathe and brims with a fantastic soundtrack, rough but beautiful camerawork, and one of the most convincing and heart-breaking performances of diminished capacity I’ve ever seen, by co-director Benny Safdie.\n\n\"Okja\"\n\nThe director of “The Host” and “Snowpiercer” working together with comedic non-fiction writer Jon Ronson to make a movie about an intelligent superpig and his best friend, a Korean farmer girl + Tilda Swinton? Fuck yeah. The typical Korean genre juggling is at play and through a keen understanding of pacing and emotion it comes together fantastically. It’s wonderfully weird, fun, and emotional. I love Okja.\n\n\"The Florida Project\"\n\nIt’s not hard to get me to cry at the movies. Some old man will reminisce about his first love, or a mother and daughter finally reconcile, but my god, I was a sobbing mess at the end of “The Florida Project”. Not to say that manipulating emotions signifies a good film, but “The Florida Project” created a deep humanistic empathy for characters rarely afforded such luxury.\n\n\"The Shape of Water\"\n\nA fun, wild, and outlandish concept, threaded through a solid and reliable structure. Along with strong performances, beautiful and memorable music, and intoxicating production design, “The Shape of Water” is deliciously genre, as well as heartfelt.\n\nThe Great:\n\n\n\"Atomic Blonde\"\n\n“How does it feel” BANG BANG. The script is needlessly convoluted, Charlize’s accent is dodgy, but holy fucking shit does this movie rock! The action surpasses the director’s previous “John Wick”, the soundtrack is killer, and despite her dialect Charlize is convincingly badass and stunning in the role. It’s visceral, pulpy, appropriately exploitative, and only second best to “Baby Driver” as the greatest action movie of the year.\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\nAn assault. Impossible to ignore. Deeply emotional, surprising, bizarre, and relentless. Oddly fablelike, and powerfully performed. I am a fan of every single film Darren Aronofsky has made, so it’s no surprise this one continues to resonate. A fever dream of a biblical horror story with room for interpretation in all directions.\n\n\"The Big Sick\"\n\nIt’s smart, it’s damn funny, and so warm and sweet. Delivering a new kind of romantic comedy, that changes the formula enough to feel fresh and different, is impressive. I’m a big fan of Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, was familiar with their story, and have now fallen even more deeply in love with their characters.\n\n\"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\"\n\nI was taken aback by the backlash this film received, and despite others best efforts, I continue to remain impressed by what it accomplishes. I’m a fan of Martin McDonagh, his plays “The Pillowman” and “The Cripple of Inishmaan”, though admittedly “Seven Psychopaths” left me cold. This films contains all his hallmarks: stylized and caustic dialogue, obsessions relating to race, disability, alcoholism, Catholicism, and murder. The naked and raw performances from Francis McDormand and Sam Rockwell, and the surprising structure and character changes, stir up tragedy and hilarity in near equal doses.\n\n\"Wind River\"\n\nAfter writing “Sicario” and “Hell or High Water” Taylor Sheridan proves himself a deeply empathetic and competent director with “Wind River”. A prestige procedural that like “No Country for Old Men” or like episodes of “Better Call Saul”, finds the entertainment and satisfaction in showing highly skilled characters elegantly performing their abilities. A film that aptly vilifies a specific and disgusting masculinity, in an incredibly harrowing context.\n\nThe Good:\n\n\n\"Battle of the Sexes\"\n\nA unique sports biopic, which is not a genre I’m usually keen on. Through the lens of homosexual self-acceptance–with one of the more sincere sex scenes seen on screen–Steve Carrel’s disturbingly charming and obnoxious chauvinism, and Emma Stone being her usual wonderful self, this is a crowd pleasing entertaining dramedy.\n\n\"Beatriz at Dinner\"\n\nFrom a script by Mike White. A socio-political, and often comedic, chamber drama. Selma Hayek plays spiritualist Beatriz as a unique, and at times frustrating character who battles Ayn Randian party guests. What could have veered into righteousness is softened by the off-kilter and unhinged atmosphere.\n\n\"Brad's Status\"\n\nAnother Mike White script, this time he directs. Ben Stiller is a great actor, and his portrayal of a self-pitying, but intelligent embodiment of white male privilege is hilarious. Your mileage might vary, but a sensitive script softens the blow and lets its characters humanity shine.\n\n\"Coco\"\n\nPixar does its first musical and it soars. Its use of Mexican folklore feels like a true appreciation and celebration, not just window dressing, and it’s repeated use of its main song “Remember Me” is emotionally brilliant.\n\n\"Colossal\"\n\nA comedy science fiction monster movie with romance and stalker elements. Truly surprising, clever, and utterly original.\n\n\"Hidden Figures\"\n\nAn emotionally charged crowd pleaser. It doesn’t break any new moulds, but it tells its story with strength and passion. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe all deliver fantastic performances.\n\n\"Ingrid Goes West\"\n\nAudrey Plaza is incredible as a deranged sycophant, who somehow remains sympathetic. A kind of hipster “Young Adult”, as in the thrilling and horrific elements are mostly based in the violations of social expectations. Funny, dark, and a surprising biting mockery of a very specific Los Angeles, Venice Beach lifestyle.\n\n\"It\"\n\nAn impressive and genuinely scary adaptation. Though it often veers a little close to: here’s a scary scene, and here’s another scary scene, the character dynamics are believable and funny. Rarely do we see kids acting like actual kids. The menace and terror drips from the screen. Solid.\n\n\"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\"\n\nHow the hell was this going to be good? But it was! Movie stars deliver a reliable back and forth, with an entertaining concept, and fun on top of fun adventure stylings.\n\n\"Lady Bird\"\n\nA solid and welcome entry in the frequently reliable and joyful coming of age film, like “Perks of Being a Wallflower”, “Edge of Seventeen”, and “Boyhood”. Nothing felt false or inauthentic, the relationships were heartfelt, and it took an interesting peek at class issues. Frequently funny.\n\n\"Logan\"\n\nA serious R-Rated superhero movie that didn’t suck, with a violent, heady, and western vibe.\n\n\"Logan Lucky\"\n\nSoderberg captures the joy of the heist, and subverts audiences expectations.\n\n\"Loving Vincent\"\n\nEvery frame a painting, actually. Sometimes style is substance, as is the case here. A good-enough script and strong performances carry us through. Ultimately, it is gorgeous and emotional.\n\n\"Patti Cake$\"\n\nA familiar structure in a unique wrapping. Our lead actress is beyond impressive, but it’s the vulnerable role of Basterd by Mamoudou Athie that really got me.\n\n\"The Disaster Artist\"\n\nA solid adaptation of the surprisingly in-depth and engaging behind the scenes book. The film makes a few reliable “Hollywood” choices, most of which are understandable. Explores a topic worth discussing, what if you are not good enough, with compassion.\n\n\"War for the Planet of the Apes\"\n\nThe new Planet of the Apes franchise has now surpassed the originals. A Great Escape style western, with apes, tribal warfare, and Woody Harrelson. Looks great, feels heavy, and is good, serious, sci-fi fun.\n\n\"Wonder Woman\"\n\nLeaps cleanly over the low-bar set by DC’s previous films. “Wonder Woman” is a good, fun entry in the superhero genre, elevated by Gal Gadot’s performance and character.\n\n\"You Were Never Really Here\"\n\nA feverish art-house “Taken” with Joaquin Phoenix. Expertly crafted and nasty.\n\n\"Your Name\"\n\nA teen romance anime with a clever conceit and impressive imagery. Shame about the frequent and terrible pop-punk songs that litter the film. Lovely story.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell\"\n\nAn amazing live-action adaptation of the original anime. Sometimes I question what people’s expectations are of movies when a feat of this level is accomplished but dismissed. Not as clever or introspective as the original, but captures its aesthetic and style with aplomb.\n\nThe Fun:\n\n\"A Cure for Wellness \"\n\nA silly, over-expensive, Hammer Horror style B-movie with A-movie styling. Obviously it was going to be a bomb, which is a shame, it’s luscious and overwrought scary imagery was good fun.\n\n\"Girls Trip\"\n\nTiffany Haddish was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Maybe the funniest movie of the year. Story was so-so.\n\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\"\n\nMore of the same, which was funny and adventurous.\n\n\"John Wick: Chapter 2\"\n\nA deeper exploration of the John Wick universe, which is a good time. Not as solid as the first mean lean machine of a movie, but brimming with fun and impressive action. Ruby Rose can’t act, even as a mute, I don’t care how pretty she is, stop giving her movies.\n\n\"Kong: Skull Island\"\n\nToo many characters to not care about, but some solid Kong action and sweeping visual direction.\n\n\"Life\"\n\nAn alien slasher movie held together by clinical and clean direction and strong performances.\n\n\"Paddington 2\"\n\nDelightful and whimsical, and oh so British. Like a warm hug.\n\n“Split\"\n\nA pulpy and fun psychological and fantastical horror flick.\n\n\"The Fate of the Furious\" \n\nThe franchise hums along with its expected massive set pieces and ridiculous stunts. You get what you paid for. Expectations matched.\n\n\"The Lego Batman Movie\"\n\nA fun, if not slight, animated comedy. Not as good as “The Lego Movie”, but in many ways it’s not trying to be, it just wants you to have a good time. Best Batman movie since “The Dark Knight.”\n\n\"Thor: Ragnarok\"\n\nA hilarious, and nearly perfect 80s infused prison planet gladiator battle film, bogged down by unnecessary Marvel stuff. It was great to see Taika Waititi’s stamp all over it, shame when it felt obligated to check the other boxes.\n\nThe Forgettable:\n\n\"Spider-Man: Homecoming\"\n\nThat was cute and fun, oh and hey, Iron Man! Also Michael Keaton was great. But what actually happened?\n\n\"American Made\"\n\nTom Cruise is a drug runner, flies planes, smiles his way out of trouble, and the camera is wild and shaky. Didn’t land with any of the heft it was supposed to.\n\n\"The Hitman’s Bodyguard \"\n\nA buddy-action comedy with some fun set pieces around the world, including Amsterdam. Obviously disposable.\n\n\"T2 Trainspotting\"\n\nThe long awaited sequel does the job but oddly doesn’t quite leave a lasting impact. Not bad by any means, and deserves a watch if a fan of the original, but won’t stick in your brain.\n\n\nThe-not-so-good:\n\n\"Alien: Covenant\"\n\nOh, almost there, but not quite. Not nearly as many issues as Prometheus but still fails to stick the landing. Plot holes, dumb character choices, etc. Fassbender’s characters are still great and I look forward to seeing if that can develop further.\n\n\"Rough Night\"\n\nAmusing enough, but barely felt like a full film. Some laughs can be found, and most of the performances were good enough, but ultimately it felt scattered and unfocussed.\n\n\"Molly's Game\"\n\nIt was weird to see Idris Elba not being good. Too much over-the-top yelling and forced dramatic arcs. I blame Sorkin the director, not the writer.\n\n\"Murder on the Orient Express\"\n\nDelivered most of what was expected, then veered off into a oddly overblown action adventure hijinks and, forgive me, fell off the rails.\n\n\"The Post\"\n\nUgh. Sure, Streep was good, but it kept building towards what was basically something deeply uncinematic. I don’t regret my movie going experience by any means, but Spielberg’s heavy hand worked against the movie. Compare to the measured and far better “Spotlight” to see the difference.\n\n\"Snatched\"\n\nHad a few laughs, and again, didn’t regret going, but it had a very messy story. The performances were good and saved some weaker set pieces.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n\"Kingsman: The Golden Circle\" \n\nTried too much, with too much fake cgi-ery that felt cheap ruining what could’ve been solid action moments but instead felt thin and ignorable.\n\n\"The Greatest Showman\" \n\nThe songs sucked, so, there’s not much more room to go from there considering it’s a musical. The bar room song was maybe the best.\n\n\"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\"\n\nWorst thing in years. See my previous post.\n\nThe outliers:\n\n\"Phantom Thread\"\n\nClearly a “good film” that just left me cold. Plenty to discuss, ponder, and pontificate after the fact. A movie I enjoyed more having watched than watching.\n\nStill to see: \n\nCall Me by Your Name\nThe Red Turtle\nKedi \nI Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore\nThe Lost City of Z \nFree Fire \nWonderstruck \nBrigsby Bear \nI, Tonya \nBrawl in Cell Block 99\n",

        "text": "The ending of *The Florida Project* really sold me on the film. Firstly, while the film is filled with great performances, I didn't quite consider that these kids are acting; they're just being kids and people are filming it, but when Moonee arrives at her friend's door and starts to cry, I was blown away that this child could do that, and still poignantly deliver lines at all (one line I guess)! \n\nSecondly, and more importantly, **this is the tensest moment in the whole film.** Moonee is crying in front of her friend, who is a little confused, and the scene starts to linger on, even cuts to the grandma and spilt food as we hear the interaction off to the side. **At this point, regardless of how the last 5 minutes play out, the ending is ultimately the same.** Would it make a difference if Moonee's friend hugged her and invited her to hide inside? Or if a police officer finds her, and they drive off to Polk county?\n\nSo if the characters are narratively fulfilled, why not engage in a bit of the fantastical? While watching the ending, I found myself laughing in confusion and truly shocked that the filmmakers took this route. Obviously, the Disney World metaphor works, but the tonal shift felt pretty audacious and rousing after a very pensive film.\n\nPersonally, I think I enjoyed it so much as I sometimes wonder in a film, what if, say, during a dramatic monologue, the protagonist was struck by lightning, and the rest of the film universe had to manage without them. *The Florida Project* doesn't take it that far, but the feeling its ending evoked is what I would imagine. The only thing I can think of that really engages with this idea is *The Game,* or maybe the surreal singing/hollywood scenes in *Precious.* \n\n* I've made my case for supporting the ending, did you appreciate if? Did it strike you as fantastical or surreal? \n\n* Any other films with an extreme tonal shift you would recommend?  ",

        "author": "mikerhoa",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/85xq4h/addams_family_values_a_competent_sequel_to_a/",
        "text": "Just rewatched Barry Sonnenfeld's *Addams Family Values* and I gotta wonder, HOW THE HELL DID THIS MOVIE BOMB SO BADLY?? Not only is it as good as the first one (which was an incredibly unlikely massive hit that raked in almost $200 million at the box office up against a budget that was less than 20% of that figure), it gave us absolutely fantastic career highlight performances by Joan Cusack, Christina Ricci, and Raul Julia.  The latter two were basically born to play their roles as [Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VbYZDohsHk) and [Gomez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ7RB3fQAA0) respectively.\n\nIn fact, pretty much all the performances were terrific, and that's exceptional considering that many of the prominent roles belonged to child actors. It's rare to have a child actor ensemble deliver a competent collective performance, but this film's cast of young actors delivered a caliber of acting that was downright amazing. Everybody, from back to front, was great. Ricci demonstrated such a subtle and uncanny brilliance in her part that I actually think the most apt comparison for her role is that of Heath Ledger's Joker in *The Dark Knight.* Both performances were genius to the point of transcendence in that the actors took characters that were relatively limited in their design and personality makeup and turned them into something so much more. While Wednesday isn't as hard edged as The Joker, at least not in terms of what we actually see onscreen, she definitely has a lot in common with The Clown Prince of Crime. Both actors went full bore into the total immersion element of their character, and both imbued them with a keen and sophisticated (yet psychotic) element of calculated chaos. Wednesday and The Joker see the world in largely the same way- banal, pathetic, hypocritical, and in desperate need of some whimsical violence and mayhem. Ricci made the role entirely her own, as Ledger did, and in the process she provided us with probably the best and most memorable character in the Addams Family canon.\n\nThough Ricci undoubtedly outshined them, David Krumholtz and Mercedes McNab also put in strong supporting turns as well. Krumholtz portrays Joel Glickman, the nebbish sidekick/love interest to Wednesday, and really excels in his  Woody Allen-esque fish-out-of-water scenario. The role could have easily been boring, one note, and even a little anti-Semitic. But he infused his character with an innocent, endearing, and even a little romantic amicability. His hapless but kind neuroses somehow made him the perfect foil for Wednesday's acerbic cynicism. \n\nMcNab's work as the valley girl blonde villain was also great. She also could easily have been an insufferable slog through one note ditz territory. But instead we get a joyfully campy, while also oddly sinister, take on the alpha female rich girl queen bee. Amanda Buckman, much like Krumholtz's Joel, represents an almost algorithmic insertion into Wednesday's existence. While Joel's innocence disarm's Wednesday and expands her horizons in terms of companionship and romance, Amanda represents her absolute antithesis, and fuels her contempt for \"normal\" society. She's the personification of everything Wednesday has come to resent and disdain. While it's not the most complex take on classism, nor is it the most comprehensive examination of resentment and contempt themes, the interplay between the two is damn fun to watch, if only because the actresses do such a good job bringing their characters' respective personalities to life.\n\nThe main plot is really just a less interesting retread of the first film- gold digger sinks her hooks into Uncle Fester with her eyes on the Addams family fortune, hilarity and havoc ensue. If Mercedes McNab's turn as Amanda was campy, Joan Cusack's performance as the black widow style murderess Debbie Jelinsky was downright ludicrous. But that's not to say it was bad. In fact, the plot itself isn't all that bad either despite it's relatively lazy redundancy.\n\nIn the context of the film's tone and mythology Debbie could have been an absolute disaster of a character. But the writers had a few tricks up their sleeves. They could have fucked up and made Gomez and Morticia resent her for being a cruel, shallow, and scummy charlatan, but that's not the Addams way. They of course have a legendary affinity for all things unsavory, so in keeping with the film's own insane logic Debbie becomes really just another chapter in the bizarre family lore. Additionally, the fact that the Addams clan ultimately took her in stride in the end really saved movie. Debbie's presence could have made for a confused and contradictory tonal mess. But the writers saw that she was a serial killer, a fiendish type of person the Addams clan historically has had no real issue with, so when all was said and done they wound up accepting her in keeping with family tradition. After watching her electrocute herself into a smoldering pile of ash, they appropriately interred her remains in the backyard family graveyard among the other fiends, ghouls, criminals, and reprobates. So what if she tried to rob and slaughter them? According to the Addams calendar that's referred to as \"Tuesday.\"\n\nBut more than anything the Addams clan's proud and enthusiastic traditional affinity for the macabre is expertly personified by Raul Julia's non-pariel portrayal of Gomez. He did such a good job in this role. In fact, if I were a film school professor or acting coach I would show his scenes to students as the quintessential example of scenery chewing done right. He brings a magnificent flair to the proceedings that is not only entertaining as hell, but opens a window into the joyful outsider philosophy that is endemic to the Addams dynasty as a whole. He takes on the world with exuberance and panache, and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially his wife, with whom he is madly in love. He will defend the family's honor against the hordes of destructive and insidious normies who mean to do them harm, all while maintaining a hellishly exuberant madness that simultaneously fuels and enthralls him. These traits are emblematic of the family itself, and Gomez is spot on as the reigning patriarch. It's a helluva lot of fun to watch, and you can totally tell that Julia was enjoying the shit out of his time on screen. Gomez is without a doubt his most popular role by far, and it should be. He was awesome in both films.\n\nI could easily go on about this movie at length, but that would result in a wall of text longer than one of Cousin It's pubic hairs, so I'll just touch on a few additional things. The film does have flaws. Like I said the familiar plot comes off as old hat and more than a little lazy, and Sonnenfeld didn't give Anjelica Huston's Morticia nearly enough to do onscreen. Plus Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Fester, while thoroughly enjoyable, didn't have have much in the way of an arc. In fact his \"kidnapping\" and forced integration into Debbie's glitzy Beverly Hills bimbo nightmare really didn't add up to all that much when all was said and done. He did seem to find love with the [alluring Dementia](http://addamsfamily.wikia.com/wiki/Dementia) in the end, but it seemed kind of tacked on.\n\nAll in all, these are really just nitpicks when you look at the film in its proper context. Nobody, or at least not me anyway, has any real strict interest in seeing a plot heavy Addams Family movie. Just provide the clever dialogue, deranged production design, and ghoulishly caustic black humor and in the end every appropriate box will have been ticked. From where I sit, this movie comes through brilliantly.\n\nI saw both of them in the theater, and actually the first one was the backdrop for my 9th birthday. We had a Thing figurine sticking out my cake and everything. My parents outdid themselves that year. Revisiting them now, along with reading about the behind-scenes-stuff, has really led me to wonder just how and why the sequel did so poorly with audiences. I suppose it did accrue a cult following over the years, but the mystery still remains as to the reason it missed the mark with audiences (but not critics) during its theatrical run. These movies were so  much fun, why did the sequel fail so hard? WHY?\n\nAnyway, if you haven't seen either of these movies, give them a shot, especially if you're susceptible to the 90's nostalgia bug like I am.\n\n*snap* *snap*\n\nEDIT: Much needed grammatical tweaking and the mistakes were fixed, for the most part anyway. I think. I was pretty drunk when I finished this thing so I went and posted without a proper edit.",

I think it's fairly obvious the apricots serve as a forbidden fruit metaphor. They're constantly being shown, referenced, eaten, fucked. I guess apricots are a better symbol than an apple because that'd be too on the nose.\n\nWhat I wanted to ask TrueFilm about specifically was the soft-boiled eggs in the film. Sure, they're a common enough European breakfast staple, but I think they must serve a greater purpose. Sure, they're a handy little device in that first breakfast scene with Oliver. He eats an egg and is offered another, but declines and says that he knows himself too well, and if he has another then it'll lead to him over-indulging. What I'm wondering is, do the eggs represent anything to anyone? They're shown again at least one more time. I could be reading too far into it perhaps, but I feel like they represent something. \n",

        "text": "**Disclaimer**: if the content of this essay has been discussed somewhere else, it is not to my knowledge. I have absolutely 0 intention of plagiarism and if there is a source you can link me to, I will give credit where it is due. As it is written now, however, this entire essay was conceived by me in my room 😊 \n\nLast week, I watched Wind River, a neo-Western written and directed by Taylor Sheridan. If you are familiar with Sheridan’s work, many aspects of tension and pacing will seem similar to those of his previous work on Sicario and Hell or High Water. As a screenwriter, Sheridan has become almost a master of intense, gritty, suspenseful films. He puts this style to great use in his self-proclaimed directorial debut, Wind River (labelled as such because it was the first film he directed from his own screenplay). But what I want to discuss is a brief illustration of how Sheridan uses his directing style to convey the overarching feeling of the movie – the feeling of pursuit and anticipation. \n\nFrom the opening shot, Sheridan already establishes what will come to be a common visual theme in the movie. We open on a shot of a woman desperately running away, almost as if she is some type of prey that is running away from a predator. Then we cut to shaky first-person shots following this same woman, as if to imply that *we* are the predators running after her – our prey. The next scene repeats this style with a new twist. We cut to a first person shot of a group of sheep, as if we are observing them. Subconsciously, we may think that Sheridan is priming us to think we are taking the point of view of predators once again. We quickly go to shots of wolves presumably examining the herd in anticipation of a hunt. (Maybe the opening shot on the sheep is from the perspective of one of these wolves?) To those that have seen Sheridan’s other work, this is definitely reminiscent of standoffs that Sheridan loves to incorporate into his movies (famous one in Sicario, and the climax to this movie itself). Then suddenly, one of the wolves is shot dead and the herd runs away. The tension seems to dissipate and now we turn our attention to the lone sniper in the woods. \n\nThematically, these opening shots do two things. First, they symbolize the overarching plot theme of the movie: **the hunt**. The entire film is essentially focused on a man and an FBI agent tracking down their suspect, analogous to the predator-prey relationship that is hinted at in the first few scenes. Essentially, we are following the predators as they stalk and eliminate their prey.  Second, it prefaces the stylistic choices that Sheridan uses throughout the rest of the movie. During its duration, there are countless POV shots from behind shrubs, branches, or from a distant vantage point. **This helps the audience assume the point of view of the metaphorical predator** as we keep a close eye on the movements around the camera. This helps subconsciously build tension and is why the movie is still engrossing despite some of its thematic clichés. In fact, the reason I was inspired to write this is because as I watched the movie, I sustained a feeling of unease at each of these shots. Every time we cut to a POV, I felt as though something was going to pop up out of the foreground. \n\nThe assumption of the predator POV is made explicit in a shot where Jeremy Renner’s character shines a light directly into the camera. The counter-shot shows that the we had assumed the POV of a mountain lion (or some other predatory cat idk) that Renner was going to kill. This is interesting to note because Renner’s character in the movie is one whose job is to hunt natural predators in the park to maintain the areas present wildlife. This makes the scene the starkest example of Sheridan’s thematic style for the movie. \n\n\nWhile some of the plot points and themes in Wind River are a bit heavy handed, thus setting it slightly below Sheridan’s work in Hell or High Water and Sicaro for me, his directorial vision and overarching style for the movie still allow it to be an above average suspense film. I thought this particular example of shot selection and theme helps illustrate why Wind River may have been loved by so many in 2017.  \n\n\nThis is my first go at something like this and I wrote it somewhat quickly, so any input will be much appreciated! Also, if I’m totally off the mark on something, lmk 😊 \n\n",

        "text": "I really liked it. I was a bit apprehensive going in due to a lot of backlash from online communities but I thought it was great. Here are my thoughts if you're interested:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Obk3yCyywFE\n\nThree Billboards follows a grieving, frustrated and burnt out mother played by Frances McDormand who personally challenges the town cops after they fail to catch the man who tortured and killed her daughter. Now I’ve had a lot of luck in recent weeks with films, I’ve seen some really good ones, but there’s something about this film that just lets you know that you’re in for a different calibre of film-making here. It doesn’t feel like a film that will come with hype and go with insignificance – characters, scenes and even the atmosphere of this small town of Ebbing become etched into your memory after you’ve seen it. From director Martin McDonagh, creator of the incredible In Bruges and the good but probably too clever for its own good Seven Psychopaths, I think I might just have found one of the best films of 2017. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis drama, sprinkled with a dash of comedy as life itself is, is really great cinema. Sometimes when you think of the phrase ‘great cinema’ you imagine grandiose sweeping epics like Once Upon a Time in the West but Three Billboards isn’t anywhere near as ambitious in that sense. The performances from veterans such as McDormand, Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are simply superb. They really took this project seriously and are given tremendous material to work with from McDonagh. Sometimes a character in a movie can come off as one dimensional and expendable, and when he’s given a backstory, better lines, a goal, a journey, an arch, he can feel more like an actual 2d element that can make an impact on the story and the overall film. If the actor plays him in such a way that he has his own little nuances and ticks, and the character itself comes off as relatable but ambiguous, genuine but irregular, he becomes someone that we might come to have an understanding of. We’ll be able to write an essay on his characterization and speculate on his off-screen actions using what we know about him as a springboard for our argument. This is what we might refer to as a three dimensional character. Then we have something else, something that due to a combination of all the previous elements the movie character rises above labels and hits a sweet spot where he no longer resembles a movie character - instead he feels like a real person, filled with flaws, ticks, emotions, drives and all the things that real people have. And Three Billboards is full of such characters, who all feel like real people. \n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe I’m sounding a bit too much like an old grandad on his rocking chair here or I’m making an unfair comparison, but I’ve often found that dramas and dramedies of old, especially during the Hollywood New Wave from film-makers like Coppola, Scorsese, Forman, Lumet and Nichols had characters that felt like real people, and it all felt effortless. Maybe I was too young and inexperienced to recognise things like character arcs or maybe it’s just that those guys and their writers were just that good, but too often when I watch a modern movie I’ve thought to myself that the characters I’m seeing on screen don’t feel like real people and instead come off as plot devices and prompts. Without waffling too much on the subject, I’ve often found myself pointing and saying “Yup, that guy is the lovable rogue. Oh look, here’s the bumbling comic relief sidekick.” Even with some of the better dramas like Manchester by the Sea I can’t help but feel I’m recognising characters as cues for the protagonist’s progression as opposed to just feeling like real people. I might be heaping too much credit onto McDonagh and the cast here but I really did love the characters and how real they felt. They still have that larger than life feel that McDonagh first showcased in In Bruges but their relationships and interactions felt genuine. \n\n\n\n\n\nThree Billboards is very funny, but I don’t think of it as a comedy. Rather the humour comes from characters who have reached such a low point in their life, have gone through such frustration and depression that their perspective of life with its little oddities is different to our own. There is deep tragedy rooted in and amongst the amusing profanity the characters launch at each other. Much of it lies in a lack of understanding and communication between each other, much like how real life conflict and discrimination often is. One character who is dying of cancer sees his life in a far different way to that of our fuming and grief-stricken protagonist. It’s almost knowing his story is ending has given him clairvoyance. It’s strange how the film can make one character’s subplot, one which involves him slowly dying of a terrible disease, leaving behind a good family, can seem more hopeful than that of McDormand’s angry character. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnger is probably the best word that summarizes the themes of Three Billboards. At the very least it bridges all the elements of the film. Every character, bar the dying one, is angry at something. Or someone. Or some people. Or some event. Or some memory. Or some relationship. Everyone is frustrated and tired. Everyone seems to have a grudge against something. A lot of them don’t even really seem to really know what they’re really angry ant, and instead just need a target to vent. And it seems only those who are willing to let go of that anger find some kind of path to solace in the film. Our protagonist has been seeking retribution for her daughter’s fate for so long, and it seems that in the beginning everyone was on her side, but so much has happened since and she’s become so alienated with the town that maybe the answer is to…move on? Her actions in the film which begin as inspiring end up feeling somewhat pitiful and unjustified once the repercussions play out. Hope, justice, revenge and forgiveness are explored deeply in this twisted, funny and sad story. There are numerous scenes of characters verbally assaulting each other, or physically battering each other, but you come away remembering the small moments of humanity shared between them, like an assault victim offering a glass of juice to his beater, or an interrogated woman comforting the tough-guy cop juts as he suddenly coughs up blood. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of McDonagh’s movies, I’d say I’d rank this somewhere in between In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths. A fine addition to his filmography. I give it an 8/10. \n",
