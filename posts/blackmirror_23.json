        "text": "I don't know if this kind of post is a thing here, but it's been an idea I've had for a while.\n\nI recently rewatched The Truman Show (Jim Carrey), and it blew my mind how much it felt like an episode of Black Mirror. Although Carrey is the star, it's barely even a comedy. It's a brilliant take on how humanity would react in this situation. \n\nAlthough that movie is a masterpiece on its own, I would love to see Brooker make his own version of something like that. His dark style of story writing could give it the ominous feel The Truman Show attempted to have. I also bet Brooker could highlight more effects it may have on humanity.\n\nI can't think of any BM episodes with a concept like this.\n[inspirational image](https://i.imgur.com/ZzS1tmG.jpg)",

        "text": "First off, I'm fairly new to Reddit so sorry if this isn't formatted correctly. Anyway, here goes. So I just recently go into Black Mirror and have been making my way through the episodes, thought not in order. I just watched White Christmas and like I usually do when I finish an ep, I check reddit to see people theories and whatnot. So as I was scrolling I noticed a lot of people really despised Beth. On paper, I see why. She cheated on her husband, led him to believe it was his baby, and then blocked him and the child from his life until her death. But I think if we take a deeper look at Beth's actions, we can find a more sympathetic take. For starters, Beth didn't plan to have Joe think the baby was his. She intended to hide the pregnancy and have it terminated. But why? Why would she get abort a baby she clearly wanted [based on her future actions] instead of just leaving Joe? Probably because she was scared of how Joe would react. Think about it: in the flashback, Joe is impulsive, has a quick temper, and possibly a drinking problem. Even when they're happy, Beth does seem a little uncomfortable around him. Not to mention, she sings \"Anyone Who Knows What Love is\" at karaoke, which is about an abusive relationship [and in general a bad sign on this show]. I'm not saying that Joe was physically abusive to Beth, just that it seems like she was afraid of him. I'm not defending cheating or lying. But I think this theory makes Beth's actions more understandable. Beth is not innocent, but then again very few Black Mirror characters are. However, I don't usually see dozens of posts on every episode discussions denouncing the characters as horrible bitches. Well, the males ones anyway. I like Black Mirror because I think it creates interesting and flawed characters in situations that make ourselves question our own actions. If the characters were never selfish, there'd be no story. So anyway, there's my defense of Beth.",

I didn’t feel the plot twists of “shut up and dance” or the dystopian feel of “15 million merits,” it’s hard to explain but the season just didn’t click well with me, Black museum had some dark parts but it was brief and not very deep. I just don’t feel like this season was as gripping or suspenseful enough, almost each episode had an ending that was wholesome and I didn’t feel the need to ponder what could happen next ( metal head had an ending like this though), it was good, but I don’t think it had the same grip as the first 3 seasons",

This is something done for [self driving cars](http://www.cscjournals.org/manuscript/Journals/IJIP/Volume11/Issue2/IJIP-1114.pdf), [facial recognition](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/facerec_tutorial.html) and (very likely) killer dogs too. \n\nAs such, anytime we see something shot in \"black and white\" during the episode, it's not for the aesthetic, but because that's exactly what the dogs would see. The reason we never break into color is because the characters are never safe (and they never were). ",

        "text": "So i saw mentioned in an article about Black Mirror's season 5 that there may be 12 episodes this time since in the teaser trailer there are 12 televisions.  Seems kinda thin but seeing how successful season 4 was I wouldn't put it past nextflix to do this.  I know originally Netflix ordered season 3 to be 12 episodes before cutting it up into 2 seasons of 6.  Maybe this time they will do 12, or we'll get a season 5 part 1 &amp; part 2.  Anyone else hear about this?  Also, why did they end up splitting season 3 up into two seasons.  Did anyone ever comment on that?",

I enjoy almost every one, but this one had no twist and was laughable throughout. Like when he almost hit the lady in his office or the stupid lady from the news running in with her camera phone. How did she not think the recon team wouldn't see her? The episode just didn't make sense. Am I missing something?",
