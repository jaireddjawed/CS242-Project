        "text": "I've read a lot about attempts at reforming/standardising languages, some successful, some unsuccessful. Reforming language seems to have been especially important in nation\\-building, especially with regards to replacing foreign loanwords with native ones to \"purify\" the language. In modern Greek and Romanian, for example, both had many Slavic words replaced with new ones coined from ancient Greek and Latin. Ataturk famously reformed the Turkish language to rid it of its many Arabic and Persian loanwords \\(along with giving it a Latin alphabet\\) and was so successful that modern Turkish speakers today are apparently unable to fully understand his recorded speeches. But I've always wondered how these reforms actually get enforced so that they take hold. It seems like it would be pretty hard to do.",

Would it be easier or harder to change the language of an entire country nowadays?   \n\nAs a counterpoint I know the successful adoption of Hebrew in Israel was largely due to the fact that the \"new\" Israelis of the time came from all over the world and didn't really have a lingua franca, allowing the revived Hebrew to fill the gap. What I'm interested in is when is already a functioning national language and we want to change it. Like say if the United States wanted to be able to conduct all government services only in Spanish, how would they go about doing that?",

        "text": "Hello, this is my first time posting here so let me know if I break any rules.\n\nI've been reading *Understanding Media* by Marshall McLuhan and he spends quite a bit of time comparing and contrasting phonetic alphabets with what he calls ideographic alphabets. Since McLuhan's focus is on how media affects the experience of reality for all those who consume and engage with it, he represents literary language as one of the primary ways that humans extend themselves into their surroundings through media.\n\nI have some quotes here below concerning his thoughts on the difference between phonetic and ideographic languages.  \n\n\"As an intensification and extension of the visual function, the phonetic alphabet diminishes the role of the other senses of sound and touch and taste in any literate culture.  The fact that this does not happen in cultures such as the Chinese, which use nonphonetic scripts, enables them to retain a rich store of inclusive perception in depth of experience that tends to become eroded in civilized cultures of the phonetic alphabet.  For the ideogram is an inclusive *gestalt*, not an analytic dissociation of senses and functions like phonetic writing.\"\n\n\"The phonetic alphabet has no rival, however, as a translator of man out of the closed tribal echo-chamber into the neutral visual world of lineal organization.\"\n\nI've been studying Chinese on my own for the last year and a half and am actually about to start a new job in China.  Because of this, I've been thinking a lot about the differences that McLuhan highlights in his book.  Everything he talks about *seems* to make sense but I don't have too much of a background in linguistics myself.  (I have a BS in English Literature.)  I just wanted to know what someone with more linguistics experience would think about McLuhan's ideas.\n\nAlso, I'd love more reading on this topic, if someone could point me in the right direction.  I'm fascinated by the idea that how we use language fundamentally changes how we experience reality.  ",

In South African English, 'now-now' means 'immediately' (whereas an ordinary 'now' can also mean 'somewhat later').\n\n    Ablaut reduplications: chit-chat, criss-cross, hip-hop, ding-dong, jibber-jabber, kitty-cat, knick-knack, pitter-patter, splish-splash, zig-zag, flimflam, wibble-wobble. In the ablaut reduplications, the first vowel is almost always a high vowel and the reduplicated ablaut variant of the vowel is a low vowel.\n\n    Shm-reduplication can be used with most any word; e.g. baby-shmaby, cancer-shmancer and fancy-shmancy. This process is a feature of American English from Yiddish, starting among the American Jews of New York City, then the New York dialect and then the whole country.\n\nNeologisms of the first three types are adopted much more slowly, while the X-shmX construction is used almost like an affix to indicate poor or questionable value, derision, skepticism, or indifference toward the object marked.\n\nDo any examples exist of reduplication within the last fifty years?

From what I've observed, it's heavily \"General American\" having been influenced primarily by central rural Vermont and rural Nova Scotian speech influences--perhaps more Vermont though. \n\nMy question is the following: are the spoken words \"loose\" and \"lose\" differentiated by vowel length (or some other vowel quality), by the difference in the pronunciation of the coda, or by both of the former suggestions. I'm ignoring spoken context by the way (which would usually distinguish the two). \n\n\"Lose\" would typically be transcribed as /luːz/, and \"loose\" would be transcribed /luːs/. The reason I'm bringing up this question is that my articulation of the final consonants in both words is with /s/ but the vowel length (or quality) is noticeably dissimilar. There could be exceptions to the pronunciation of the final phoneme in \"lose\", however, such as when the following word starts with a vowel sound or voiced consonant.\n\nThis surprised me since I had always believed \"lose\" to be consistently pronounced with a /z/ (then I kinda got into linguistics) and I'm now thinking otherwise. \n\nNow please note that the two words used above are just examples, meaning this could apply to two words where everthing is pronounced the same except for the final /s/ or /z/ sound. \n\nAlso, please correct me on any mistakes I have made in my post. \n\nThanks, Gray",

Not only does it group Uralic with PIE, but also includes widely rejected families such as Altaic and Elamo-Dravidian.\n\n* Indo-Semitic: PIE is not an Afroasiatic language, and therefore cannot be grouped with Proto-Semitic unless it is done in a proposal where Proto-Indo-European is a sister language to Proto-Afroasiatic.\n\nI personally believe that a language in the Caucasus, Western Asia, or even Eastern Europe would be the most likely candidate.

The classic example is sing (present) - sang (past) - sung (past participle) - song (noun). I'm aware that this trend hearkens back to proto-Indo-European, where roots would appear in different vowel-grades.\n\nIn modern English, it seems that most such roots have lost the four-way distinction that \"sing\" displays and display a three-way or two-way distinction. The one thing that does seem to have held pretty consistently from PIE is the presence of an -o- in  the noun forms.\n\nA few sets (I'm too lazy to do IPA transcriptions):\n\nThere appear to be quite a few verbs following the ee-e-oo pattern\n\n&gt; Bleed (present), bled (past), blood (noun)\n&gt; \n&gt; Breed (present), bred (past), brood (noun)\n&gt; \n&gt; Meet (present), met (past), moot (archaic noun)\n\n&gt; Feed (present), fed (past), food (noun)\n\ni - ou - ()\n\n&gt; bind (present) - bound (past) - bond (noun)\n&gt; \n&gt; find (present) - found (past) - (no noun)\n&gt; \n&gt; fight (present) - fought (past) - fight (noun)\n&gt; \n&gt; wright (present) - wrought (past) - wright (agent noun)\n\nother\n\n&gt; speak (present) - spoke/spake (past/archaic past) - speech (noun)\n&gt; \n&gt; ring (present) - rang (past) - rung (past participle)\n&gt; \n&gt; bring (present) - brought/brang (past/dialect past) - brought/brung (participle/dialect participle)\n&gt; \n&gt; think (present) - thought (past) - thought/thunk (participle/archaic participle) - thought (noun) (also \"thank\" is etymologically related)\n\n&gt; stink (present), stank (past), stunk (participle), stink/stank (noun/dialect noun)\n\nAre there (or were there ever) any consistent rules for predicting the ablaut forms of English words? The ablaut is still productive; we have young forms like \"snuck\" as a past tense of \"sneak\" (which is also related to the noun \"snake\").",

What actually got me thinking about this was seeing the word \"kielbasa\" misspelled \"kielbasi\" as the owners would pronounce it as, /kilˈbɑ.si/ instead of /kilˈbɑ.sə/. And in the past I've seen \"Sriracha\" spelled \"Sirachi.\"\n\nBut looking around online, I'm having trouble finding any reference to this phenomenom.
