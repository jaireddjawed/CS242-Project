        "text": "A civilization that chooses to close its eyes to its most crucial problems is a stricken civilization.\n\nA civilization that uses its principles for trickery and deceit is a dying civilization.\n\nThe fact is that the so-called European civilization – \"Western\" civilization - as it has been shaped by two centuries of bourgeois rule, is incapable of solving the two major problems to which its existence has given rise: the problem of the proletariat and the\ncolonial problem; that Europe is unable to justify itself either before the bar of \"reason\" or before the bar of \"conscience\"; and that, increasingly, it takes refuge in a hypocrisy which is all the more odious because it is less and less likely to deceive.\n\nEurope is indefensible.\n\nApparently that is what the American strategists are whispering to each other.\n\nThat in itself is not serious.\n\nWhat is serious is that \"Europe\" is morally, spiritually indefensible.\n\nAnd today the indictment is brought against it not by the European masses alone, but on a world scale, by tens and tens of millions of men who, from the depths of slavery, set themselves up as judges.\n\nThe colonialists may kill in Indochina, torture in Madagascar, imprison in Black Africa, crackdown in the West Indies. Henceforth, the colonized know that they have an\nadvantage over them. They know that their temporary, \"masters\" are lying.\n\nTherefore, that their masters are weak.\n\nAnd since I have been asked to speak about colonization and civilization, let us go\nstraight to the principal lie which is the source of all the others.\n\nColonization and civilization? \n\nIn dealing with this subject, the commonest curse is to be the dupe in good faith of\na collective hypocrisy that cleverly misrepresents problems, the better to legitimize the\nhateful solutions provided for them.\n\nIn other words, the essential thing here is to see clearly, to think clearly - that is,\ndangerously - and to answer clearly the innocent first question: what, fundamentally, is\ncolonization? To agree on what it is not: neither evangelization, nor a philanthropic\nenterprise, nor a desire to push back the frontiers of ignorance, disease, and tyranny, nor\na project undertaken for the greater glory of God, nor an attempt to extend the rule of law.\n\nTo admit once for all, without flinching at the consequences, that the decisive actors here\nare the adventurer and the pirate, the wholesale grocer and the ship owner, the gold\ndigger and the merchant, appetite and force, and behind them, the baleful projected\nshadow of a form of civilization which, at a certain point in its history, finds itself obliged,\nfor internal reasons, to extend to a world scale the competition of its antagonistic\neconomies.\n\nPursuing my analysis, I find that hypocrisy is of recent date; that neither Cortez\ndiscovering Mexico from the top of the great teocalli, nor Pizzaro before Cuzco (much less\nMarco Polo before Cambaluc), claims that he is the harbinger of a superior order; that\nthey kill; that they plunder; that they have helmets, lances, cupidities; that the slavering\napologists came later; that the chief culprit in this domain is Christian pedantry, which laid\ndown the dishonest equations Christianity=civilization, paganism=savagery, from which\nthere could not but ensue abominable colonialist and racist consequences, whose victims\nwere to be the Indians, the yellow peoples, and the Negroes.\n\nThat being settled, I admit that it is a good thing to place different civilizations in\ncontact with each other that it is an excellent thing to blend different worlds; that whatever\nits own particular genius may be, a civilization that withdraws into itself atrophies; that for\ncivilizations, exchange is oxygen; that the great good fortune of Europe is to have been a\ncrossroads, and that because it was the locus of all ideas, the receptacle of all\nphilosophies, the meeting place of all sentiments, it was the best center for the\nredistribution of energy.\n\nBut then I ask the following question: has colonization really placed civilizations in\ncontact? Or, if you prefer, of all the ways of establishing contact, was it the best?\n\nI answer no.\n\nAnd I say that between colonization and civilization there is an infinite distance; that\nout of all the colonial expeditions that have been undertaken, out of all the colonial\nstatutes that have been drawn up, out of all the memoranda that have been dispatched by\nall the ministries, there could not come a single human value.\n\nFirst we must study how colonization works to decivilize the colonizer, to brutalize\nhim in the true sense of the word, to degrade him, to awaken him to buried instincts, to\ncovetousness, violence, race hatred, and moral relativism; and we must show that each\ntime a head is cut off or an eye put out in Vietnam and in France they accept the fact,\neach time a little girl is raped and in France they accept the fact, each time a Madagascan\nis tortured and in France they accept the fact, civilization acquires another dead weight, a\nuniversal regression takes place, a gangrene sets in, a center of infection begins to\nspread; and that at the end of all these treaties that have been violated, all these lies that\nhave been propagated, all these punitive expeditions that have been tolerated, all these\nprisoners who have been tied up and \"interrogated, all these patriots who have been tortured, at the end of all the racial pride that has been encouraged, all the boastfulness\nthat has been displayed, a poison has been instilled into the veins of Europe and, slowly\nbut surely, the continent proceeds toward savagery.\n\nAnd then one fine day the bourgeoisie is awakened by a terrific reverse shock: the\ngestapos are busy, the prisons fill up, the torturers around the racks invent, refine,\ndiscuss.\n\nPeople are surprised, they become indignant. They say: \"How strange! But never\nmind-it's Nazism, it will. pass!\" And they wait, and they hope; and they hide the truth from\nthemselves, that it is barbarism, but the supreme barbarism, the crowning barbarism that\nsums up all the daily barbarisms; that it is Nazism, yes, but that before they were its\nvictims, they were its accomplices; that they tolerated that Nazism before it was inflicted\non them, that they absolved it, shut their eyes to it, legitimized it, because, until then, it\nhad been applied only to non-European peoples; that they have cultivated that Nazism,\nthat they are responsible for it, and that before engulfing the whole of Western, Christian\ncivilization in its reddened waters, it oozes, seeps, and trickles from every crack.\n\nYes, it would be worthwhile to study clinically, in detail, the steps taken by Hitler\nand Hitlerism and to reveal to the very distinguished, very humanistic, very Christian\nbourgeois of the twentieth century that without his being aware of it, he has a Hitler inside\nhim, that Hitler inhabits him, that Hitler is his demon, that if he rails against him, he is\nbeing inconsistent and that, at bottom, what he cannot forgive Hitler for is not crime in\nitself, the crime against man, it is not the humiliation of man as such, it is the crime against\nthe white man, the humiliation of the white man, and the fact that he applied to Europe\ncolonialist procedures which until then had been reserved exclusively for the Arabs of\nAlgeria, the coolies of India, and the blacks of Africa.\n\nAnd that is the great thing I hold against pseudo-humanism: that for too long it has\ndiminished the rights of man, that its concept of those rights has been - and still is - narrow\nand fragmentary, incomplete and biased and, all things considered, sordidly racist.\n\nI have talked a good deal about Hitler. Because he deserves it: he makes it\npossible to see things on a large scale and to grasp the fact that capitalist society, at its\npresent stage, is incapable of establishing a concept of the rights of all men, just as it has\nproved incapable of establishing a system of individual ethics. Whether one likes it or not,\nat the end of the blind alley that is Europe, I mean the Europe of Adenauer, Schuman,\nBidault, and a few others, there is Hitler. At the end of capitalism, which is eager to outlive\nits day, there is Hitler. At the end of formal humanism and philosophic renunciation, there\nis Hitler. ",

        "text": "if it is true that theories are only the images of the phenomena of the exterior world in the human consciousness, it must be added, concerning Eduard Bernstein’s system, that theories are sometimes inverted images. Think of a theory of instituting socialism by means of social reforms in the face of the complete stagnation of the reform movement in Germany. Think of a theory of trade union control. Consider the theory of winning a majority in Parliament, after the revision of the constitution of Saxony and in view of the most recent attempts against universal suffrage. However, the pivotal point of Bernstein’s system is not located in his conception of the practical tasks of the Social-Democracy. It is found in his stand on the course of the objective development of capitalist society, which, in turn is closely bound to his conception of the practical tasks of the Social-Democracy.\n\nAccording to Bernstein, a general decline of capitalism seems to be increasingly improbable because, on the one hand, capitalism shows a greater capacity of adaptation, and, on the other hand, capitalist production becomes more and more varied.\n\nThe capacity of capitalism to adapt itself, says Bernstein, is manifested first in the disappearance of general crises, resulting from the development of the credit system, employers’ organisations, wider means of communication and informational services. It shows itself secondly, in the tenacity of the middle classes, which hails from the growing differentiation of the branches of production and the elevation of vast layers of the proletariat to the level of the middle class. It is furthermore proved, argues Bernstein, by the amelioration of the economic and political situation of the proletariat as a result of its trade union activity.\n\nFrom this theoretic stand is derived the following general conclusion about the practical work of the Social-Democracy. The latter must not direct its daily activity toward the conquest of political power, but toward the betterment of the condition of the working class, within the existing order. It must not expect to institute socialism as a result of a political and social crisis, but should build socialism by means of the progressive extension of social control and the gradual application of the principle of co-operation.\n\nBernstein himself sees nothing new in his theories. On the contrary, he believes them to be in agreement with certain declarations of Marx and Engels. Nevertheless, it seems to us that it is difficult to deny that they are in formal contradiction with the conceptions of scientific socialism.\n\nIf Bernstein’s revisionism merely consisted in affirming that the march of capitalist development is slower than was thought before, he would merely be presenting an argument for adjourning the conquest of power by the proletariat, on which everybody agreed up to now. Its only consequence would be a slowing up of the pace of the struggle.\n\nBut that is not the case. What Bernstein questions is not the rapidity of the development of capitalist society, but the march of the development itself and, consequently, the very possibility of a change to socialism.\n\nSocialist theory up to now declared that the point of departure for a transformation to socialism would be a general and catastrophic crisis. We must distinguish in this outlook two things: the fundamental idea and its exterior form.\n\nThe fundamental idea consists of the affirmation that capitalism, as a result of its own inner contradictions, moves toward a point when it will be unbalanced, when it will simply become impossible. There were good reasons for conceiving that juncture in the form of a catastrophic general commercial crisis. But that is of secondary importance when the fundamental idea is considered.\n\nThe scientific basis of socialism rests, as is well known, on three principal results of capitalist development. First, on the growing anarchy of capitalist economy, leading inevitably to its ruin. Second, on the progressive socialisation of the process of production, which creates the germs of the future social order. And third, on the increased organisation and consciousness of the proletarian class, which constitutes the active factor in the coming revolution.\n\nBernstein pulls away from the first of the three fundamental supports of scientific socialism. He says that capitalist development does not lead to a general economic collapse.\n\nHe does not merely reject a certain form of the collapse. He rejects the very possibility of collapse. He says textually: “One could claim that by collapse of the present society is meant something else than a general commercial crisis, worse than all others, that is a complete collapse of the capitalist system brought about as a result of its own contradictions.” And to this he replies: “With the growing development of society a complete and almost general collapse of the present system of production becomes more and more improbable, because capitalist development increases on the one hand the capacity of adaptation and, on the other – that is at the same time, the differentiation of industry.” (Neue Zeit, 1897-98, vol.18, pg.555)\n\nBut then the question arises: Why and how, in that case, can we attain the final goal? According to scientific socialism, the historic necessity of the socialist revolution manifests itself above all in the growing anarchy of capitalism, which drives the system into an impasse. But if one admits with Bernstein that capitalist development does not move in the direction of its own ruin, then socialism ceases to be objectively necessary. There remain the other two mainstays of the scientific explanation of socialism, which are also said to be consequences of capitalism itself: the socialisation of the process of production and the growing consciousness of the proletariat. It is these two matters that Bernstein has in mind when he says: “The suppression of the theory of collapse does not in any way deprive socialist doctrine of the power of persuasion. For, examined closely, what are all factors enumerated by us that make for the suppression or the modification of the former crises? Nothing else, in fact, than the conditions, or even in party the germs, of the socialisation of production and exchange.” (Ibid., pg.554)\n\nVery little reflection is needed to understand that here too we face a false conclusion. Where lies the importance of all the phenomena that are said by Bernstein to be the means of capitalist adaptation – cartels, the credit system, the development of means of communication, the amelioration of the situation of the working class, etc.? Obviously, in that they suppress or, at least, attenuate the internal contradictions of capitalist economy, and stop the development or the aggravation of these contradictions. Thus the suppression of crises can only mean the suppression of the antagonism between production and exchange on the capitalist base. The amelioration of the situation of the working class, or the penetration of certain fractions of the class into middle layers, can only mean the attenuation of the antagonism between Capital and Labour. But if the mention factors suppress the capitalist contradictions and consequently save the system from ruin, if they enable capitalism to maintain itself – and that is why Bernstein calls them “means of adaptation” – how can cartels, the credit system, trade unions, etc., be at the same time “the conditions and even, in part, the germs” of socialism? Obviously only in the sense that they express most clearly the social character of production.\n\nBut by presenting it in its capitalist form, the same factors render superfluous, inversely, in the same measure, the transformation of this socialised production into socialist production. That is why they can be the germs or conditions of a socialist order only in a theoretic sense and not in an historic sense. They are phenomena which, in the light of our conception of socialism, we know to be related to socialism but which, in fact, not only do not lead to a socialist revolution but render it, on the contrary, superfluous.\n\nThere remains one force making for socialism – the class consciousness of the proletariat. But it, too, is in the given case no the simple intellectual reflection of the growing contradictions of capitalism and its approaching decline. It is now no more than an ideal whose force of persuasion rests only on the perfection attributed to it.\n\nWe have here, in brief, the explanation of the socialist programme by means of “pure reason.” We have here, to use simpler language, an idealist explanation of socialism. The objective necessity of socialism, the explanation of socialism as the result of the material development of society, falls to the ground.\n\nRevisionist theory thus places itself in a dilemma. Either the socialist transformation is, as was admitted up to now, the consequence of the internal contradictions of capitalism, and with the growth of capitalism will develop its inner contradictions, resulting inevitably, at some point, in its collapse, (in that case the “means of adaptation” are ineffective and the theory of collapse is correct); or the “means of adaptation” will really stop the collapse of the capitalist system and thereby enable capitalism to maintain itself by suppressing its own contradictions. In that case socialism ceases to be an historic necessity. It then becomes anything you want to call it, but it is no longer the result of the material development of society.\n\nThe dilemma leads to another. Either revisionism is correct in its position on the course of capitalist development, and therefore the socialist transformation of society is only a utopia, or socialism is not a utopia, and the theory of “means of adaptation” is false. There is the question in a nutshell.\n",

        "text": "As a fan of Bravo's Real Housewives series, I think that the show and Bravo as a whole need a leftist analysis. I mainly watch NY, Dallas, and OC, but I also am a casual viewer of Potomac, Atlanta, and NJ, and despite the different/revolving casts and different locations the show is very insightful on the rich and really their pathetic lives. And the corrosive nature of wealth. Here are a few observations that I've learned. \n\nA) It's been said a lot on this sub and on the pod, especially when discussing Meghan McCain but the rich don't do jack shit. I mean to be fair, some of them have some legit successful businesses like Bethenny Frankel, but the vast majority of these brods don't do anything and have no other purpose to their existence than being rich. And when your life is based around that concept it just becomes one of endless shallow pleasure seeking and money wasting destructive vanity projects. Which leads to my second point...\n\nB) And because your life is reduced to these types of destructive behaviors it's no surprise that these women are destroyed by them and have multiple failed loveless marriages and/or strained relationships with their parents or children, let alone get along with each other.
