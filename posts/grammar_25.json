Before, the gift (had?) seemed like something expensive to Skint.\n4. So, when Skint (had?) heard that it was a watch, he was (had been?) surprised.\n5. \"What? Were you expecting a car?\" asked Rich.\n6. Rich's company was (had been?) invested in by one influential being after another, so it was about to enter Forbes 500. Still, he got (had gotten?) Skint such a cheap gift.\n7. Even when Skint (had?) picked his nose right in front of Rich, Rich (had?) only lost a fraction of his love for One.\n8.

This one means who started the quiz.

This is a tooltip explaining what does it do. I don't like the part: \"incl. change evaluations already...\" Shouldn't this be \"incl. changing evaluations\", or even better \"incl. change OF evaluations...\" ?\n\n3.
