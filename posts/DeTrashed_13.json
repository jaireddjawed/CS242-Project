        "text": "I just found this sub, it‚Äôs amazing! I‚Äôm kind of a trash maniac. Maybe I think about where it all ends up too often? I was inspired by the stonercleanup to do more but I already pick up as much trash as I can. If I have free time at work, I pick up my trash grabber and take a walk. It‚Äôs like getting paid to pick up trash! It‚Äôs shocking how much there is.\n\nI‚Äôve been recycling, garbageing, and food wasting in accordance with something along the lines of this [Seattle times article ](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/what-do-i-do-with-a-guide-to-trash-sorting-in-seattle/)and [King county pdf ](https://kingcounty.gov/~/media/depts/dnrp/solid-waste/garbage-recycling/documents/recycling-yardwaste-food-garbage-guide.ashx?la=en) except my recycling place doesn‚Äôt accept glass, I take it to the store in the reusable bags. We haven‚Äôt forget bags once since taking glass to the store for recycling. But other people in the house don‚Äôt put stuff in the right place. The recycling is a sticky mess and the trash is full of food.\n\nYesterday I talked to everyone I live with and put a ‚Äúno glass or plastic bags‚Äù sign on the recycling and a ‚Äúno food‚Äù sign on the trash. Someone asked why no plastic bags and I said because they get stuck in recycling machines and are too poor of plastic to be recycled. For something to be recycled someone else is going to have to handle it. I printed out a copy of the [pdf](https://kingcounty.gov/~/media/depts/dnrp/solid-waste/garbage-recycling/documents/recycling-yardwaste-food-garbage-guide.ashx?la=en) for everyone to look at and sent it to one. We talked about food not decomposing in landfills and how compost works. We live somewhere that‚Äôs so big it accepts meat scraps in the yard waste, how crazy and easy. I haven‚Äôt even tried composting yet. \n\nThis morning i wake up to [this trash can](https://i.imgur.com/feedvcE.jpg) with a bunch of leftovers dumped in it. They weren‚Äôt mine and I‚Äôd never eat it, I have no problem with getting rid of it. But they threw it in the trash! So I dug it out (I said I‚Äôm a maniac) and put it in the [bowl for food scraps](https://i.imgur.com/kv9PjtV.jpg ) (just until Saturday when we will get something that closes because no one wants to look at their waste or bring it outside). \n\nIt seems like a personal attack haha. Should I expect people in my house to recycle and not put food waste in the trash? I realize this sub might be a little biased but am I asking too much? The signs are just as much for me as anyone else. Yesterday I threw a kiwi into the trash and had to pick it out.\n\nThis sub is great and I‚Äôm excited for the future! When you see someone litter do you ask them to pick it up?",

To play all you need is a case of beer, a bunch of trash bags and a group of friends.\n\nHow to play:  Have one player carry the case of beer and a trashbag, while everyone else just holds a beer. The bag guy is the goal keeper, and no trash is aloud too get past them.  The other people pick up trash while they walk.  The goal keeper can point too trash for the pickers to grab. Anytime you pick up a piece of trash, drink.  Anytime the goal keeper misses a piece of trash and gets called out, they are relieved of goalie duties and trade places with the pickers. \n\nRepeat until woods are clean and/or y'all are out of beer.
