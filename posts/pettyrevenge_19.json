        "text": "Pre-pandemic was working with a group of over 300 people.  One of them used to sit right next to me.  I was highly respected and even feared by many of the people I worked with.  I was one of the top people working on this project and I had a reputation for getting things done.  I became friendly with many of these people as we were working together for long hours for months on end.  One day we were talking about music, rap music specifically.  We would often speak about different things to take our minds off the pressure we were all under.  I had mentioned that I used to joke with my kids that you could write a rap song with three words and that my son told me some guy stole my song and he played it for me.  Of course everyone wanted to know what the three words were.  The words were B%\\^ch, N&amp;\\^ga, and Ho.  There is a song called  \"**Stop Snitchin**\" by American rapper [YG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YG_(rapper)).  The song basically starts by repeating these words over and over.  This guy knew the song (I had forgot the title) and the artist.  No one said a word about it and I never thought about it after that.  Months later after we were all forced to work from home the George Floyd incident took place.  Well we were all friends on Facebook and we wound up in a heated discussion about it.  Of course, my being white made me a racist for saying anything about this event.  At least to this guy anyway.  So, he threatens me on FB saying that he is going to report me at work for making racist comments.  I had no idea what he was talking about.  I even asked him what I said and when I said it.  No answer.  Several days later I get a call from HR telling me I am under investigation.  You have to understand this was a very large multi-national corporation we worked for.  Two days after that I was let go.  So, I know I made several mistakes here but I am pretty old school.  People from my generation are usually a lot more tolerant and thick skinned.  They don't get offended by everything especially when quoting a song lyric.  Funny how you can hear this on the radio all day long and it doesn't bother you but some white guy in the office quotes the song and you suddenly get offended.  Anyway, not looking for people to tell me what I did wrong just looking for ways to get back at this guy who got butthurt because someone disagreed with him.  I am actually much better off since he got me fired but that is not the point.  He needs to learn that you don't mess around with people's livelihoods.  That is just not something you should do.",

        "text": "This happened when I was a kid but I was reminded of the incident over the holidays so I thought I'd post it here!\n\nWhen I was about 4 years old, like most kids, I loved snow.  I loved making snowmen, snow angels, just adored playing in the snow.  After the first big snowfall of that year, several of us were attempting to make a big snowman at the playground.  Jack (then around 13 or so) was the neighborhood troublemaker and he had the bright idea of scaring the shit out of us.  And so he told us that snow was alive, and when we stepped on it, we were killing it.  The squeaky noise when you stepped on freshly fallen snow was its death scream, and the reason it turned grey/brown was because that was the color of its blood.\n\nNeedless to say, we were all horrified.  We ran up to our parents who were watching us, crying about how we killed snow.  My mom tried to assure us that snow wasn't alive, but a couple of things to consider: 1) This was pre wide-spread use of the internet, which meant you had to look up information in actual books.  Given our age, we couldn't read said info and instead had to trust that our parents were telling us the truth.  However, we didn't believe them because 2) Jack was older and so more likely to tell us things that adults didn't want us to know (and we were too young to realize they were more likely to spew BS), and 3) my mom had broken my trust in her word months earlier when she was eating what I thought was an orange, except the color was different.  Instead of telling me it was grapefruit, she lied to me and told me it was an orange, and offered me a slice.  Since I loved oranges, I shoved it into my mouth and eagerly bit down, and deeply regretted it.  In fact, my hatred of grapefruits and refusal to eat it lasted well into my 20s, so you can imagine my grudge and distrust over whatever my mom was trying to convince me of mere months later was still fully intact.  4) Since Santa Claus only brought presents for people on the nice list and we knew killing was the worst thing in the world, we were under the impression that we wouldn't just be banned from receiving gifts this Christmas but all Christmases to come.\n\nWhen they realized they couldn't convince us of the truth or console us, they tried to get Jack to apologize to us and tell us he was lying, but Jack had wisely bolted once we'd gone crying to our parents.  For a few days after we suffered from nightmares and refused to step onto snow.  Eventually one of the parents came up with a way to demonstrably reveal the truth that snow was just water by melting it in a pot.  When we all realized that Jack lied, we were furious.\n\nSo a bunch of 4-5 year olds banded together and planned our revenge.\n\nOur plan?  Every time we saw Jack, whether he was stepping onto freshly fallen snow or not, we all screamed, \"Killer!\" at him.  You can just imagine the looks on our neighbors' faces, and the horror in Jack's.  When we were chastised by our parents and made to stop, we borrowed a miniature tape recorder from one of our friends' older brother Peter and recorded us yelling \"Jack is a killer!\" at irregular intervals, and got him to play it on the school bus, during recess, and in the school hallways by promising him future Halloween candy.  Jack retaliated by trying to bully and beat us up, but since the only time he could get to us was while we were at the playground where we were under adult supervision, he couldn't do much.\n\nPeter stopped because he didn't want to get caught, but we weren't yet satisfied.  Come summer, we set up a lemonade stand to earn some money, and we made enough to buy a bubble gum tape and bribe Peter to stick several wads of gum in Jack's hair on school picture day.  Grunge was really popular then and Jack's long hair was his pride and joy.  It went even better than we'd hoped as Peter had really spread the wads of gum around.  In the end Jack's hair had to be shaved off entirely as otherwise his hair would've been in patches.\n\nJack left us alone after that.",

        "text": "This is not my story. My wife works at a restaurant, and a fellow server shared this story of this artful revenge. This happened earlier this week.\n\nSandra is a regular at the restaurant, coming in almost every day for breakfast. She always orders the same thing: a kid’s breakfast, one of the cheapest things on the menu. The servers all know her and like her.\n\nA few days ago, Robert was Sandra’s server, and she confided in him that her husband had had a heart attack shortly after Christmas, and while he had survived, it had shaken them both pretty badly. When Robert heard this, he asked the restaurant manager (GM) if they could comp her breakfast that day, out of sympathy for her situation. GM flatly refused, and told Robert that if he wanted her to get free breakfast, he’d have to buy it himself.\n\nRobert went ahead and bought that breakfast on his credit card, and proceeded to tip himself several hundred dollars on the check. When he left for the day, he cashed out as usual, but the extra tip he left himself meant that he walked home with almost all of the cash on hand for the restaurant.\n\nThe next day, the GM had to make a special trip in on his day off to bring cash to the restaurant from the bank. This stunt cost Robert a fair bit, since he had to pay income tax on the “tip” he received from himself, but he figured it was well worth it. GM never did connect the dots as to why exactly the restaurant ran out of cash, but Robert had the smug satisfaction that his petty revenge on GM had worked perfectly.",

        "text": "I’m doing my stint in retail. It’s honestly a lovely environment, though I have gotten accustomed to the occasional rude customer. This lady however takes the cake.\n\nI welcomed her and offered my assistance as she came in, and she ignored me. Happens all the time, so I shrugged it off and went back to work. A couple minutes later she comes back and tells me she needs help getting some items from the top shelf. No problem, but just as I’m about to radio for someone she’s already walked away. A couple minutes later and she hasn’t come back so I figure there’s no point in radioing and making someone stand around to wait for her, so I don’t. Apparently that was my first mistake!\n\nEventually she comes back and starts swapping between longing stares at the top shelf and angry glares at me. I ask if she’s ready for assistance now. Mistake number two! She angrily tells me that she has been ready the entire time. My bad, I apologize and radio for someone. \n\nA few minutes pass and nobody comes. She asks me how long I expect her to wait. I apologize and explain that I radioed, that I unfortunately cannot leave the register area to assist her, and ask if she’d like me to radio again. She says what do you think. \n\nSo I radio for a second time, and then a third, and nobody comes. At this point she is very angry. Luckily one of my coworkers walks by and I get her to assist the customer. Unluckily, that meant she was finally ready to checkout. \n\nIt’s clear that she’s boiling at this point. I still follow my “script” asking if she found everything alright and the like. That, my friends, was mistake number three. She completely goes off on me at that point. Demanding my name, smugly saying that she’ll get me fired, etcetera etcetera. I say that I understand it must’ve been frustrating to wait for so long, but it was out of my control. \n\nThis was apparently the wrong response. \n\nShe rants that it wasn’t the wait that was the issue, but that it was me. In the meantime, I take the 25% and 10% coupons she slammed on the counter, and I pocket them. She was too upset to notice. So she checks out, rants some more as she goes out the door, and afterwards I check her purchase to see how much money she would’ve saved.\n\nShe lost out on about 280$ of savings. I gave the coupons to the next customer. \n\nIt isn’t much, but it was very nice to imagine her getting even more upset when she checks her receipt!",

        "text": "A little background. I work as a machine operator, I was training for over a year to be a mechanic. The mechanics on first shift are much better than the ones on second shift. Also the ones on second shift only speak English as a second language, so it’s harder to convey information. That’s why I did swing shift, to learn from first shift. The mechanics are the ones responsible for troubleshooting, fixing, and changing over the machines. There were also a couple machine operators that started the exact same day as me, one of them was so bad at that they had to move him out of the building, the other still can’t do basic maintenance, and he sure as shit can’t do a changeover. \n\nFor months I’d been told “We need you to learn this so we can make you a mechanic and put you in charge of the building.” I did swing shifts, split shifts, and overtime to learn all that I could. The mechanics didn’t have anything left to teach me. I can fix anything and everything, I can do changeovers faster and more reliably than 3/4 mechanics. I learned enough that a couple of the maintenance guys were even trying to get me in their department when they had an opening, but my supervisor shot that down because I’m too vital where I’m at.\n\n(Bragging time) There’s one machine, I’m usually the only person who ever runs it, it’s the only machine in the building that can run all day every day with no real problems. It wasn’t like that when I started 2 years ago. I modified parts, adjusted sequence timing, and computer settings to turn it into the most reliable machine in the building. I’m very proud of this machine so we’ll call it “my machine”.\n\nIt got to a point where I was the go to guy to fix the other machine operators issues. My supervisor would say things like “I need you to change this machine to this and get that out, truck leaves tomorrow! I don’t trust these other guys with it.” Sometimes the second shift mechanics would ask me to help them with their problems if they couldn’t figure it out even though they’ve got 40 years combined experience. They should have no problem with this stuff. I was barely running a machine anymore, I spent most of my time helping other people or doing changeovers so first shift could come in and run. So after months of talk I asked them to deliver on it, make me mechanic on my shift and give me a raise. “Sorry, we don’t think you’re quite there yet.”\n\nCue the Petty Revenge. I called off for a few days, to use up my PTO in case they decide to fire me for what I was about to do. When I came back I stopped clocking in early to touch base with first shift about what to expect, I stopped helping people, I stopped fixing machines and doing changeovers. I stopped keeping a detailed downtime log. I quit doing general upkeep on the machines. I started taking my time with everything I do. I started taking 45 minute lunch breaks. I have a good work ethic, so when I first enacted my revenge it took considerable effort to keep myself from doing the things that are above my pay grade but within my skill set. \n\nIt took the plant manager a week to call me into his office for a meeting. In that meeting I told them promises of better things to come wasn’t enough for me and that I didn’t want to be a mechanic. He tried to offer me more money, but I reminded him that as of the week prior I wasn’t ready to be a mechanic per my supervisor so I just want machine operator responsibilities and money. \n\nCue Their Petty Revenge Attempt. For a couple months they were putting me on trouble machines and testing the waters by asking me to do changeovers. I refused the changeovers on the spot and if a machine wouldn’t run reliably with minor adjustments I’d text my boss and let him know it requires a mechanic’s attention and ask which machine to run next. I always get a good feeling from that text, because I could fix it if I wanted to, sometimes I even do if it’ll make my day easier over all. They haven’t called me out for it either, even though they also know I could fix it. \n\nThis brings us to today. We’ve reached an unspoken equilibrium it seems. They’ve been keeping “my machine” scheduled so I’ve been running it for a couple weeks now. I say unspoken because I come in, start my machine, find something to watch on my iPad, and don’t talk to anybody all day. That’s why I’m here. It’s been 3 months and I’m running out of things to watch. Help!!",

I got a dorm assignment very late in the process so they sort of clump together all the odds and ends. He was so shy the rest of the dorm labeled him as antisocial. One or two people who may have been drinking came up with a nickname for him based on how he looked and somewhat on his tendency to always look up they called him \"The Gopher\". I never named called him because I had some sympathy for him but it was a bunch of 18 to 20-year-olds so at some point my dorm made must have overheard people say this disparaging term in the hallway. Apparently he associated it with me and was not happy with me. Graduate students got out for Christmas break a couple weeks earlier than the rest of us. My dorm mate enjoyed eating kimchi. On hot fall days the smell of it in the room was pretty rough and difficult to handle so I always have the windows open. The day that he was gone for his Christmas break was a hot day. When I came into the room the smell was very strong and offensive. Once again I opened the windows and it diminished but I closed and locked them before going to sleep because I was on a ground floor unit in an urban center college. Next morning the smell was back in very intense again. I started searching the room first looking in the garbage cans and I found an empty jar of kimchi. I emptied it outside and clean out the garbage can and thought I had finally solved the problem. That afternoon when I got back from class the smell was back again just as intense. I was quite frustrated but started looking absolutely everywhere in the room. I found that there was a book on the shelf that was concealing the lid of the jar which had a big hunk of kimchi sitting in it.... This was clearly sabotage.\n\nAfter dealing with the kimchi I decided I would get my revenge. I couldn't stand the dorm because it was running amok with freshman who did nothing but screw around and made it very difficult to study. Requested that my contract be broken made a year and found an apartment with a friend. I knew there would be no repercussions for my revenge. I went to the self-serve deli sandwich part of the cafeteria in the student union and made up the wettest sloppiest most disgusting combination of ingredients I could fit between two big slices of bread. I took this mess home and threw it into his dorm refrigerator which he had unplugged because it was empty. Knowing it was going to be sitting there for at least 3 weeks and that this was an unusually warm winter break I felt very very good...",

I was decent enough with my instrument to qualify in competitions.\n\nStory: In between music competitions in high school and WMTA, I entered a competition for students with private tutoring. When I arrived, I happily discovered there were only two slots (me and the other flutist) and they rewarded those in first and second place. This meant I was guaranteed for placement.\n\nLike I said earlier, I was decent, but not phenomenal. I didn’t mind what place I earned bc I was in it for the love of music.\n\nSo, I played my piece for the judge and waited to see how I did. Imagine my shock when I didn’t place at all!\n\nI told my teacher, who talked with the judge to understand how they determined my placement.\n\n**TLDR:** we found out the judge wanted revenge on my teacher. I didn’t bother to ask what happened; I only know that there was bad blood between them. So the judge decided the best way to hurt her was through her student.\n\nThat was the last year I competed. Between that and a judge interrupting the toughest duet I’ve played in my musical career, I gave up on hoping for a fair judge.\n\nI didn’t quit music altogether. I still play the flute and piano (another instrument I competed in) for myself.",

        "text": "  \n\nThis is another store about my wife in her home country and a racist employee. On one trip to visit her small island country, we arrived at the main airport on the island with the capitol. That is where we were staying and most of her family lived. We decided one weekend to visit the other larger island (think Hawaii vs. Oahu) being from a western civilization we went to the office and bought round trip tickets. Leaving today returning tomorrow. We would spend one night on the larger island with family and return. Our tickets were for specific ferry times. Going to the larger island was fine, no problems and a nice ocean trip. My wife gets seasick easily, so I was worried about her, but she was a champ. We spent the rest of the day with family and had a great time. We found a quaint little place that rented small village huts to tourists and spent the night there. Our next ferry ride was at 1:30 in the afternoon, so after breakfast we got in our rental car and headed to the ferry. Once we arrived we noticed a lot of vehicles waiting, and I mean a lot. The line was maybe a quarte mile long. The real kicker was as we for there early (mind you our reservation was at 1:30 and we arrived at 1:00) we noticed the ferry leaving. Now as it was evident many of the cars started leaving, but we wanted to know why the ferry left early and when the next one would be. So we pulled up to the ferry office, got out and went to talk to the attendee. This was woman may be 35 to 40 years old. As I stated earlier I do not understand their language, but my wife and this woman started talking. The longer the talk took, the louder they got. About 10 minutes I started hear shouting and angry words (you know the kind but do not understand them) from both ladies. Since it was raining earlier, my wife had a umbrella with her and as the angrier she got she started shoving the umbrella through the little window at the attendee. The fight went for another 5 minutes before we stormed off. Back at the car my wife told me what happened. The attendee is in charge of the ferry at this end so she decided to let the ferry leave early, but the next one was tomorrow morning. The fight was about we had confirmed tickets and the attendee did not care. So we slept in the car (which was not comfortable at all) and the next morning we found out why the ferry left early. The attendee comes out and starts picking the cars she wants to let on the ferry. Obviously favoritism toward friends and family. Obviously because I am white and my wife fought with her, we were not picked. Cars all around us were getting on the ferry, front of us, back of us, etc. We did not get on the ferry. As the ferry left without us, I told my wife the next ferry that came I was parking our car at the gate and no one was getting on the ferry until we did. During the wait the family members we visited came to see what was going on since they heard about the fight. They knew the attendee and talked with her and smoothed things out. So we did get on the next ferry.\n\nHere is the revenge part. As we got back we went to the ferry office at the capitol and complained to the owner about what happened to us. He refunded our ticket (both ways) and also the extra day car rental since we could not return it as planned. He also told us the attendee was ex-army (US I believe) and had a hard time so asserted her authority like she did in the army. The attendee got a few days off to cool down, but not fired.",

And so my siblings and I decided to get them a nice one for Christmas. \n\nBoth my parents were very happy about it. However, my dad has decided to take charge of it and “doesn’t have time” to show my mom how it works or help her get the app set up on her phone. He won’t share the log in info so none of us can help her. He plugged it in and has it set up but won’t give it a schedule cause he has to set up barriers for it. But he won’t let my mom do these things. HE has to do it. \n\nMy mom is insanely annoyed. My dad even named it without talking to my mom. So she is mad that it was a combined gift and she hasn’t been able to enjoy it at all. (My siblings and I have talked about it and my moms birthday is coming up and we’re gonna spoil her with things since my dad is being an ass about this). \n\nSo all the grandkids were over and they made a big mess. We got it all cleaned up but the floor really needed a vacuum. My mom went off on how she wishes she could use her Christmas present but SOMEONE won’t teach her how to use it. (My dad works from home but I’m sure he didn’t hear her). So she pulls out their normal vacuum and is vacuuming. Then she turns to me and says “I’m going to vacuum outside his office just to bug him”\n\nThen she had a big smile on her face as she went and vacuumed the very small hallway outside his office door for like 15 minutes. \n\nNot a crazy revenge but I immediately thought of this sub and thought maybe someone else would enjoy my mom’s revenge.",

        "text": "This is a very bland revenge plot but it made me feel good so I wanted to share.  \nI work in sales and I primarily sell electric motors. Right before new years I had a particularly difficult customer (J) reach out to me needing a motor replaced. He always complains about something and last week when I didn't come to work for a family emergency he called my coworker and yelled at her because he insisted I should have told him I would be out..... because I clearly PLAN family emergencies. You get the point. I sent over a quote and left it at that.  \nRight before I leave for the day to enjoy my long weekend, he emails me back. He says \"Just an FYI, \\_\\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_\\_ gave me GOOD pricing. I bought the motor from  someone else for $400.\"\n\nNow this pissed me off for many reasons. 1. you're really going to end my year like that?   \n2. one of the names he dropped is a DEAD MAN, as in an old employee that has been dead for 5 years and the second employee he named hasn't worked here in about 12 years.  \n3. I am a 3rd party seller. I buy products directly from manufacturers at a discounted cost and I sell to others with a minimal markup. People buy from me because to buy directly from the manufacturer, the product would cost 3x what I can buy it for. My cost for that motor was over $500. The fact that he somehow bought it from another seller for less than my cost.... seems shady. He couldn't have gotten it directly because he has a small business and doesn't sell enough product to get an account made.\n\nSo I ignored his email and let it stew for a couple days. Then, something dawned on me. About a week ago I noticed he bought some parts from me and direct shipped them to another business that I was familiar with. Since I primarily sell motors some people don't realize we sell a lot more than that. So a customer that buys motors from me (R) was buying parts from this other customer of mine (J), not realizing that guy (J) was buying the parts from me. Now, telling (R) this information would have been morally wrong. So I didn't... not in those words.  \nToday, (R) called me to order a motor and when I sent him over some paperwork, I included a line card with all of the other items we sell and other services we offer. I made sure to let him know if there is anything else I can help him with, to give me a call. Wouldn't you know, 10 minutes later he calls me \"Oh so you sell parts as well?\" I said \"I sure do\". Now he won't have to deal with an extra charge from going through (J) and I'll have one less reason to hear from (J) all together.  \nI hope this wasn't too confusing.",

        "author": "Notsplots",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1039w95/7th_grade_cheater_fails_end_of_year_math_exam/",
        "text": "TLDR: Cheater uses me and my friends so I intentionally let him copy the wrong answers from my math test, and he fails 7th grade.  \n\n\nIn 7th grade I had a run in with a cheater in my math class, pre algebra. We were allowed to work in groups of up to 4 people on the math homework. Myself and 2 others were the top students and so we always worked on the homework and finished really quickly. Once done we had free time to do what ever we wanted, normally we played card games for 5-10 minutes. All was fine until one day about half way through the year one of the class clowns with poor grades strolled up and took a seat at our pod of 4 chairs. We didn't expect much but he did ask for help. Being nice we did help and and over the course of the next few months his grades started to improve.  \n\n \nOn test days instead of desks arranged in 4 person pods they were all split up individually and facing the same way. There was no seating assignments and wouldn't you know the cheater sat himself right in-between me and my friends. I didn't care much cause he had been working in class with us for a while so no big deal. Well, turns out it was a big deal. I finished my exam stood up to turn it it and as I came back I saw him looking over at my friend's test copying answers. We had been played and I was mad, but I decided to do nothing for the time being.  \n\n\nLater that week, when the scores came back for the unit the cheater had done really well,  and even got a prize for most improvement. But I knew the real reason why. We had been used and I began to plott my revenge.   \n\n\nI told my 2 buddies about what happened and they wanted in on the revenge too. We let him keep working on homework for the final unit with us. But instead of taking the time to teach the cheater, we started just letting him copy from our work. See we were much faster and had been slowing down to help him. This had significantly decreased the amount of free time at the end of the period to chill or play cards. (The math teacher was super cool) So by letting him just copy our answers we got all that free time back, and it ensured that he wasn't really learning the material. It all came to head on the final test day.  \n\n\nI got to class early that day to made sure to sit with an open seat to my right, my good friends sat to my left. When the cheater got to class he went straight to the seat next to me and looked very relieved he got that seat. I was too, cause for my plan to work he needed to be able to cheat off of me and only me. \n\n Being the end of year exams it was comprehensive and about 2x the size of the normal test so we had to work quickly. It only took a few questions and I started to notice that he was copying off my test. To test my theory, I skipped a question and flipped the page. Not 5 seconds later he also skipped a question and went to the next page. Que revenge! I started recording the correct answers on my worksheet out of site of the cheater, and deliberately filling in the exam bubbles with the wrong answers. He copied all of the wrong ones. I was smart and skipped a few here or there to make it not be too easy for the cheater and to give me a reason to not finish at the same time. Once we got all the way through to the end of the exam the cheater felt like he was good enough, filled in the skipped questions with random answers, stood up to turn in his exam, and then left the classroom with a smug look on his face. I was giddy as well and I proceeded to erase all of the bad answers and fill in all the correct ones. I ended up being the last person to turn in my test because of this which was perfect.  \n\n\nAs I turned in my exam the teacher asked why it had taken so long for me, as I was usually one of the first, and I explained the whole thing. I told the teacher I expected the cheater to get no more than 10 questions correct especially not any after question 11. The teacher was very disturbed by this news and told me to follow him to the teachers lounge where the auto grading skantron machine was. He brought the exam key, my test and the cheaters test. He ran mine through and I scored a 97, and then he ran through the cheaters test, he got a 7. The teacher was shocked thanked me for telling him and told me good job on my exam. He also said he was going to go have a chat with the principal and to expect a call down some time later to re explain everything.\n\n\nThe fallout: The principal decided the cheater had to retake all of his end of year exams. Turns out the cheater did similar things in other classes and failed multiple exams. He didn't pass 7th grade. He had to do summer school and when I talked to the math teacher the next year it sounds like it didn't go well.  The math teacher explained that we wouldn't be seeing the cheater at the school but left the reason why very vague. One of my frie da comments that the cheaters home was for sale. I never saw it heard of him again.",

You put $1 in coins in and got 48 minutes of dryer time. It’s worth noting that the dryers really sucked and very rarely fully dried your clothes after the 48 minutes and when the timer finished, you could only pay by another full 48 minutes. However, if you added an extra quarter while it was still running, you could get an extra 12 minutes, which was usually enough to finish the drying. Well anyways, I pay for my load, set my phone alarm for 45 minute so I could add an extra quarter if needed without paying the full $1 to start the machine up again. \n\nMy alarm rings, and I go to the laundry room, only to find my clothes soaking wet on top of the machine and someone else’s laundry in the machine with over 48 minutes on the machine timer. Now I don’t know what this person was expecting, but let me assure you, I took the rest of the extra dry time on the machine and she came back to find her soaking wet clothes scattered allllllll over the floor.

        "text": "When we were in our early 20's (I'm turning 50 next year), we had a friend who was one of those golfers that never lost a ball. He could slice it 50m into the rough and would mysteriously find it perched perfectly on a tuft of grass ready to play. If he landed in the rough, he always had a perfect lie, his ball somehow always just missed the water unless it was obvious it landed in the middle of the lake.\n\nEveryone knew he was a cheat but he seemed to think we didn't know.\n\nOne day, we were playing into a par 5. A long second shot up a steep hill, with out of bounds directly behind the green, flag unsighted from a dip. He smashed a 3W off the deck, and hit it perfectly in line with the pin, but we couldn't see the pin at the time, so we didn't know that. When we got up onto the green, his ball wasn't on the green or in the bunkers, and we all assumed he went over the green into out of bounds as he hit it pretty well. Of course, just like always, he found his ball in the rough behind the green and did the usual \"Found it, Titleist 3, rough must have held it up\" (or whatever ball he played), then got onto the green and 2 putted for par. He walked away happy with himself convinced he'd pulled the wool over our eyes.\n\nAfter we all putted and while we walked to the next tee, another friend pulled me aside and showed me his pocket. He found the ball in the hole when he walked across the green but didn't tell our cheating mate because he had already \"found his ball\". To this day, we've never told him. We aren't friends with his anyone, but from what I know, he's never got a hole-in-one or albatross to date.",

This never happened:\n\n#Tell a story of how a pet groomer exacted revenge on a nasty customer, in the style of a Reddit post.\n\nOkay, so I'm a pet groomer at this small family-owned business, and we've got this one customer who is just the worst. I mean, seriously, every time she comes in she's rude, demanding, and always has something to complain about. It's gotten to the point where I dread seeing her name on the schedule because I know it's going to be a long, unpleasant day.\n\nWell, a few weeks ago she brings in her poodle for a grooming appointment, and as usual, she's being a total nightmare. I try to stay calm and do my job, but I can't help feeling angry and frustrated. And then I have this moment of weakness where I decide to get a little revenge.\n\nSo, as I'm finishing up the grooming, I make sure to leave a small patch of fur unbrushed and matted on the poodle's back. It's not something that's super noticeable, but I know this woman is obsessed with her poodle's appearance and she's going to notice eventually.\n\nSure enough, when she comes to pick up the poodle, she doesn't notice the matted patch at first. She's thrilled with how the grooming turned out and pays me without a second thought. But then, when she gets home, her spouse points out the matted patch and she goes ballistic.\n\nShe calls the grooming business and starts yelling at me, telling me how incompetent I am and how she's going to take her business elsewhere. I listen to her rant for a minute and then apologize profusely, promising to fix the mistake on the next grooming appointment.\n\nShe reluctantly agrees, and a few weeks later she brings the poodle back in. This time, I make sure to do an absolutely perfect job, and when she leaves, she's all smiles and thanking me for my excellent work.\n\nI know it was a petty move to leave that patch of matted fur, but it was a small way to get back at her for being such a nasty customer. Plus, it made me feel a little better to know that I had gotten one over on her. I know it's not the most professional way to deal with a difficult customer, but sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do.",

I know she's a vegan, because she tells me all the time. Mostly when I order food. I think someone programmed her to launch into a soliloquy anytime the words bacon cheeseburger are said. Anyway, she's pretty annoying, but I can tolerate it. Other than that, I get along great with everyone.\n\nAnyway, the vegan in question hosted a get together and obviously everything she had was vegan. I made sure to eat before hand, but I still tried some dishes. I didn't like any of it, but I didn't complain about it. She, however, seemed to gain a lot of pleasure in asking how the food was. Well, last month some of my friends are at my place and we're having a blast. GF invites a bunch of her friends, they arrive, it's a blast. We didn't invite the vegan, however, because like me my friends are fond of some meat, but unlike me, they would have let her know about it. We decided to avoid it and leave her out.\n\nShe hears about the party and is VERY upset to not be invited. My GF explained the situation, it was last minute, it's my friends, there is no good option for her and got an earful for her troubles. Well, New Years presented an interesting chance. One of my friends and one of GF friends took a liking to each other and are now dating. So we decided to combine friend groups for New Years. I hosted again and put my friend in charge of food. Naturally, he bought all the good food, none of which is vegan. So everyone arrives, starts drinking, everyone is eating having a blast and the vegan is sitting in a corner with her lips pursed, clutching a beer, with some baby carrots my GF gave her. She left pretty soon after 12.\n\nBefore you say anything, yes I am an inconsiderate asshole. When I was being a considerate asshole, she didn't like that so instead of being the considerate bigger person, I went the other way. This is a sub for pettiness after all.",

        "text": "Hi, I'm 23(F), an introvert mother who have had a lot of pettiness, most of which I am not proud of. This community made me remember almost every single of my petty act and here is a story:\n\nI grew up in a remote village up in the mountains where a tribe of indigenous people lives. My father worked for a facility there and he brought as along with him because me and my brother were always sick in the city. \n\nThis is gonna be a long story because details are important.\n\nI don't know when exactly I became an introvert but according to my mother I was a brilliant child who loved the outdoors and socializing with anyone and everyone that I could always be kidnap. Fortunately, I did not. \n\nAnyways, everyone in and outside the village knows who I am. The brilliant kid who is jolly, friendly and pretty, who always won, who always join pageants and competition, who was always on the stage, the teacher's pet, etc.\n\nI was top of the class until the niece of the village captain transferred to school. From Grade 1 to 5, I was Top 1 but I graduated elementary as Salutatorian (who wasn't given the opportunity to speak on stage except to introduce to guest speaker) and the niece became Valedictorian - which I thought was unfair. \n\nNevertheless, I was friends with her. I didn't mind a little friendly competition. \n\nI got scholarship for highschool. Then there's this new girl from a far away village who was described (and I agree) as cringe. She is smart, no doubt. She was a fierce competition. But I never let her outsmart me. I still represented the school in academic competitions, pageants, art, dance, journalism, and sports. I was captain of the Most Discipline, Best in Attendance, Most Awards, and with the most MVP team during Intramurals. I am the only girl to ever lead a boy scout platoon. I was active in every community event, I was always part of any committee for any event (except weddings and birthdays because I never got invited). I was the prom queen, too. But I never got any photos of the coronation because the teacher's camera suddenly ran out of storage and battery. \n\nI never bragged. I sound like I am bragging right now, but I never did IRL. \n\nI never had a tight circle of friends. I was always the extra. I was never invited to picnics by the river, hangouts, or whatever. Which is fine because I would rather stick my nose on a book. \n\nA few months before graduation, one of the teachers arranged an accommodation for those who wanted to take a scholarship test for any college anywhere. I never found out about it until the last day of submission when my former English teacher asked me if I'm ready to take the exam. Fortunately, I have everything ready always because I kept every file I have organized so I managed to beat the deadline. During preparation, I overheard that all the teachers and most of the parents of every student in my school wanted to take away my highschool scholarship and my chance to get a college scholarships. Only one of the teachers and the principal stood for me. \n\nFast forward, out of 10 qualified students, I'm the only one who got the scholarship. I never found out until the registration day. They did not give me the acceptance letter. \n\nGoing back to High School Graduation, I was Salutatorian again. The cringe girl became Valedictorian because of the 0.89 difference in our grade. The niece of the captain was 5th place.\n\nAs per custom, all the awards that a student earn from the entire school year would be awarded on graduation. I was excited because I know I will earn a lot of medals and certificates. \n\nAlso, as per custom, High School Salutatorian will also deliver a speech. So I prepared for it. \n\nThe day before the graduation, I was told I will not be giving a speech because they want to keep the ceremony short. There was only 54 graduating students. I don't think a 5 to 10 minute speech will make the ceremony last the entire day. \n\nI did not protest. I couldn't. I just cried myself to sleep. \n\nDay of graduation, I never got all my certificates, just the one medal that says Salutatorian of Batch'15. I was SOOOOOOOOOOOO devastated. 3rd placer was supposed to speak and lead the oath taking. But she suddenly got stomachache and had to rush to the loo. I volunteered. \n\nAs I was on stage, looking at everyone, I was slowly filling with rage. After the oath taking, I hijacked the program and went ahead to give my own speech. \n\nI couldn't remember it verbatim but I said something along the lines of, \"As a student, I never expected that I will be pulled down by the people expected to bring out the best in me.\"",

This is not actually my story but my dad's,  but he is not on Reddit. \n\nMy dad lives out on a farm, and there is no recycling service that will come out to pickup recycling, so he takes it in every so often to the recycling center himself.  He had recently purchased a new piece of yardwork equipment,  I can't remember exactly what it was but it came in a large heavy duty box.  \n\nDad decided this box would be good for hauling his recycling to the center.  So he put bundles of newspapers (yes he is old school) his plastic microwave dinner container/plates, milk jugs ect. and taped the box up so stuff wouldn't fly out while it was in the back of his pickup truck. He goes into town to run errands and drop off his recycling.\n\nFirst stop was the home improvement store, then nextdoor to Wally World.  When he comes out of the store there is a police officer and a store security team member waiting for him at his pickup truck.  Apparently while he was in the store some guy pulled up and took the box out of the back of Dad's truck and put it in his own.  Police officer was already at the store and stopped the guy.  Security team member provided the CCTV footage, they all had a good laugh when Dad told them the box was basically filled with trash. Turns out the guy had an outstanding warrant and had other stolen property in his truck so he still was arrested and he was convicted. All because he tried to steal Dad's recycling.",

I check the label and yup, it's mine.  \n\nOfficer explains that my package had been stolen.... BUT he saw the guy take it!  The officer had been stopped at a red light just across from my house when he sees our soon to be thief walk past my house (and my package).  Officer said he could see the thief turn and look back at the box.  All the time he's watching the thief and thinking to himself... dude, I'm RIGHT HERE!  Sure enough the guy swipes the box off my steps and is IMMEDIATELY arrested.   \n\nThe stuff in my order was worth less than $100 so we're not talking grand larceny but the thief did spend a couple of months in jail.  Eventually his case came up and the DA let him off for time served because he was unlikely to get more time than that anyway.",

        "text": "I use to work for a huge international company. Keeping it vague for privacy, but our industry worked with billable hours (you bill clients based on the time you spent working on projects). Also important is higher in the company you are, more your hours are worth, so me being a low on the hierarchy employee wasn’t worth a lot. \n\nSo I joined this company fresh out of school. My old direct boss at the time tells me about X client, who max does $75,000 worth of business with my company per year. He says they just never could get more out of them, but he was hoping I could help because this was a client in niche industry, and I just so happened to have life-long experience being around this industry which is basically instant bonus points to companies in this field. \n\nWell, fast forward a year and some change. My old direct boss left, new direct boss comes in but she’s also very supportive of me. I grow this business from 75k to about 600k, purely through building relationships with the clients and proving myself. I was so proud of this but my bosses boss and the head of the office were not as impressed and would not give us more resources when we asked (even though this client went from one of the smallest to about the 4th largest client in the office- and all of the clients on that level had huge teams working on them, we just had me and my boss a little bit bc she was primarily focused on another account).\n\nWe reach the next planning time for the next year. My boss and I put together a kick a$$ plan. The client commits to over $750k with us. We’ve now grown the client 10x from when I started. \n\nWe show the head bosses the numbers and it’s physically not possible for me and my boss to do all the hours we’ve estimated for these projects. We even showed that the growth of the account would more than pay for an addition to our team. Not only could we afford it, we had to have it to meet our commitments. \n\nAnswer from the head bosses? “We will just have some higher ups (who bill at higher rates) “consult” on the account. Aka- we will help spend the budget but not actually provide help to get the work done. \n\nNow, I’ve been unhappy in this job for a while. Between some sketchy labor law stuff they were pulling, general mistreatment of our team, being personally insulted by one of the higher ups (she literally said I wasn’t good at a significant piece of my job, which then I won awards with the very pieces she was criticizing), and then this, I was now done. \n\nAn old boss of mine had just so happened to reach out to me around this time offering me a job. I didn’t want to relocate so I worked a deal with them to consult for them remotely, then made plans to set up my own consulting business. I happily turned in my 3 weeks notice (not because I wanted to but because of some timelines for some projects, I didn’t want to leave the client high and dry). \n\nWhat I didn’t know but soon found out, my direct boss was also making moves to quit (she felt the same way I did) and ends up going to a direct competitor of our company who just so happens also had part of the client’s business. \n\nSo she gets on the client account at this other company. We bide our time, keeping in contact, until the contract with our old company is up. Then… we launch our plan. \n\nWe go to the client and the company that my boss works for and tell them our idea. Had a few details to iron out but everyone loves it. So I work as a subcontractor to my boss’s new company, and the client sends all the business to us. Every. Last. Dime. \n\nMy only regret is not getting to see my former head boss’s face when the client called to tell them they were pulling three quarters of a million dollars worth of business away from them and giving it to the ones they claimed weren’t good at their jobs.",

This female dog even THREW MY PENCIL OUT OF THE WINDOW LIKE WHAT???\n\nThe best part is that she thought that i was her friend?????\n\nSo one day, I was done with her, and I just told her \"I don't want to be friends with you anymore\" AND THIS KID BURST INTO TEARS LIKE WHAT?????\n\nAnyways I felt really happy for myself lol I was NOT expecting that reaction",

        "text": "This took place about 25 years ago but is still one of my favorite stories. I worked at a small print company as a customer service rep. There was one other girl that did the same job as me but supported other sales people and one girl whose main job was receptionist but she also supported one sales person. \n\nThings started to get bad with management. They were rarely there but started telling us if we weren’t on time they were going to dock us a day’s pay (not legal obviously) and would monitor our time clock. We were all paid hourly and had to punch in and out with a time clock. Our start time was the same (8am I believe) and on occasion because of traffic we may be a few minutes late but nothing crazy. We always got our jobs done and our clients were happy. We never had any complaints from our sales people either. \n\nOne day the other customer service rep was a few minutes late. She got called into her boss’s office (two hours later when he showed up) and asked to sign a sheet of paper saying she acknowledged that she’d be docked a day’s pay. She said absolutely not, that’s not legal, I’m not signing anything. Luckily it was her rather than me as I was a bit more green in the job force and don’t always stand up for myself when I should. I was a little more meek and fearful. \n\nOther small things started to make our lives miserable there. The other CSR and me were made to share an office. This was not inherently bad in itself unless we needed to be on the phone with a client when it could be distracting, but it was right outside the main bathroom and it would smell like crap constantly. \n\nWe were told we needed to answer phones whenever the receptionist was away from her desk which we were happy to do as she was our friend and we didn’t mind helping but it was just one more thing added to our already busy responsibilities and could interfere with that job. \n\nSo the three of us hatched a plan to quit on the same day. We were all miserable and were sick of being treated the way they treated us and worried about getting in trouble for the littlest things. As the day approached the other two girls kept saying they didn’t think I would go through with it. If there is one thing I don’t like it’s being called a chicken. So that Friday I marched into my boss’s office with my letter of resignation…after realizing both of the other girls had called in sick/late. They both heard from me that I had put in my notice so they came in after lunch. One turned in hers to her boss at the end of the day and the other left it on her boss’s desk before she left for the day. \n\nCome Monday morning lots of calls over the intercom and meetings about this. I was called in and asked if I would consider staying to help them in the transition. I politely declined as I told them I was taking my career in another direction. They didn’t ask either of the other girls who were pissed about that, especially because one had been there much longer than me. They assumed they both quit just because I did. So in effect I had a little petty revenge on both them and the bosses in the end as I was able to quit before them after they said they didn’t think I had the guts to do it.",

I'm not gonna get into the details of what the evidence is against him, but suffice it to say it was *OVERWHELMINGLY* sufficient for me to immediately cut ties. \n\nI then went on a campaign to out him publicly, as we shared many friend groups and regular group events prior to my discovery of his raping multiple of our mutual lady friends (*for the last 20 years, mind you*). \nI warned a few female acquaintances that were adamant that I and all his victims were lying. His victims can't speak up, but as I was never a victim, I felt it would be shitty of me to not at least warn other women in his various social spheres. \n\nOne of these women *HAAAAATES* me. As in the last time I was around her, she and her mom (while tripping on acid and E) literally kept screaming about how I was demonic and evil. Hail Satan! Lol\nAfter I gave her a very barebones breakdown of what the rapist had done, she decided to tell everyone that I was crazy and evil. Original. But whatever. She also hid the rapist when the police were looking for him to serve him a restraining order. \n\nSo I did a little digging and figured out that she was working for a pretty large event planning company that rhymes with skeever. \n\nI emailed their customer service and let them know that I was concerned that this woman was in charge of helping plan large events in our area and therefore could be giving access to further victims for the rapist. \n\nThey emailed me back almost immediately and requested information, at which point I directed them to the detective working on the case. \n\nShe was fired almost immediately and is now an Uber driver. \n\nSo fucking satisfying.",

        "text": "This might not be as powerful of a revenge as some of the others I've read here, but it makes me feel a bit better and is still in the works. Also, apologies if the formatting comes out awful, I'm on mobile.\n\nI've worked in the outbound shipping department of a factory for almost 9 years, having been put into the swing shift since I started.     Let me preface this with he fact that I have always loved swing shift.  Its cooler in the summer once the sun goes down, and in the winter business slows down enough to get extra projects done and keep things moving smoothly and looking nice.  My base job has only really one requirement and that is to load trucks ( which takes about 10 minutes per) clean up my own messes ( which after doing the job for so long only happens when equipment fails) and storing the daily material samples.   \n\nAbout 6 months ago now, our new boss had started talks of switching our schedule from five 8 hour shifts to four 10 hour shifts.    This change had been thrown around for a long time and the kinks were finally being worked out.   We have 3 shifts changing their schedule, and the hours and days had finally been worked out.  Each shift got called into the bosses office sometime this previous summer for a vote, a vote we were told had to be unanimous. \n\nNow the hours for our shift weren't perfect.  Our current shift is 3 pm to 11pm.   Living an hour from work, I have gone to bed at 1 am almost religiously for close to a decade. This new schedule handed to us had us working from 3 to 1 am.  With truck loading still closing at 10:30.     We talked it over with the boss, that we would vote yes on this schedule if it was changed to 2pm to midnight.     He agreed and we cast our yes votes. \n\nA couple months pass by to August 30th.  We are asked to pick our schedules and days by seniority.    My current team and myself selected our swing shift positions, with my younger competent coworker staying on this shift only because of the hours we selected and because he wants fridays off instead of a dayshift spot with Mondays off.   His choice based on the fact that we are working 2 to midnight.    We return to our work area and double checks with me those are still the hours, so I call the boss to confirm and to my surprise the boss says \"No, the swing shift hours will be 3 pm to 1 am. With truck loading closing at 1030\".     When we confronted the boss the next day in person, he feeds us a bullshit answer that someone up in the office changed the schedule.   When pressured on this a few weeks later he admits it was him, and still gives us very weak answers on why.\n\nHere's where my pettiness shines.  Sorry it took so long to here.      \n\nBeing in the department for almost 9 years I've scooped up quite a bit of extra work.    I've swept all three floors of our main truck loading area, ( a powdered aggregate loading facility gets dirty)  I took over customer lists and stocking orders for the next day in our billing program, and ive taken over checking various sump pumps and preventative maintenance on equipment.  Additionally I would take it upon myself to gather up any loose tools I would find floating around and return them to our tool cage.  It sounds petty/stubborn even to me that I would abandon these for a change in bedtime.   I would be performing these tasks no more.    \n\nThis is all still ongoing but the facility has become almost a disaster zone.     There are piles of material all over the place, the office has almost a half an inch of dust on the floor and most surfaces are coated.    Nobody can find tools since they can't be bothered to put them away when they use em.\n\n  Yet the pinnacle has yet to come.   I still check equipment even if im not performing maintenance, and their age is showing.  Most of the machines are coming up on 50 years old, with some being close to 70 and without the regular care are starting to show their age.   It hurts to watch them start to struggle and move slower than they should.     One of the older buildings even flooded over Christmas weekend, and while I cant attribute a broken pipe  to my own handiwork, I probably would have caught it early if I was still checking the pumps and heaters in that building on Fridays. \n\nMy locker has been cleaned out since the day he told us our votes were cast on a lie.    Which means I have none of my personal tools or any of the tools that were passed to my by the various people who used to perform my jobs.    I made careful steps to not take any tools that were company property, instead placing them in the department tool cages.  Interestingly enough, most of those tools have already disappeared because coworkers carry tools to a job and leave them there to be filled with dirt and grime.   There's some other messes building, but I know this is long already.   This is still a work in progress.     I'm not sure if I'll stick around to see how bad it gets.  \n\nTLDR:   New boss has us vote on a schedule under false pretenses and then lies to my face.    I have since retreated to only performing the bare minimum of duties( sometjint many others in the department do) and has led to lost tools, equipment on the verge of failure, and possibly a building flooding.",

        "text": "I live in a cooperative - this means reduced rent payment in exchange for building upkeep and services - someone cuts the grass, someone shovels the snow, etc. My job, is parking enforcement, and management of the public computer lab for our residents to use - since a good chunk of them are low income and can't even afford internet service.\n\nSo, way back in September, I saw some expose video on doorbell camera footage and the freaky shit it captures - like the one of the lady standing there for 15 minutes holding a knife but never knocks on the door or anything - so I bought expensive doorbell cameras for myself, my sister who lives in the same condo building as me, and my parents who are about an hour away. I also bought the service for person detection and cloud storage, all that premium stuff, total, $1200.\n\nPlease recall that it is September at purchase, and these are xmas presents - so, bye bye return window. The company gave me 3 months of premium service free so there was no real loss of service from Sept-Dec. while they were sitting in the closet.\n\nFast forward to three days ago.\n\nI'm installing the doorbell camera on my door. I've already run the wires inside, so the last step is only a 5 minute job - two screws, one hole, feed the wires through. By sheer coincidence, during this 5 minute window, my neighbour, who unfortunately is one of the frequent users of the computer lab, is taking their dog out for their duty. We say our pleasantries and that's it. Before they're even inside, and before I can even finish setting up the software for it on my phone, I have an email from the condo board, saying public facing cameras are not allowed in the building. CLEARLY I know who complained.\n\nI staunchly defend my purchase stating I can disable the motion detection and keep it so it's only \"active\" when someone physically presses the button - but to no avail, they were adamant on not having it and not allowing it, even threatening eviction on me over a few texts of me trying to save my purchase - nothing rude or anything - willing to even post them publicly.\n\nI decide to leave it up overnight, because it's like 9pm at this point and I don't want to rip it all apart. I wake up the next morning, and there's a note taped over the camera with a copy of the bylaws, that say \"Electronic devices with cameras facing public spaces are not allowed.\"\n\nSo, I tear it all off, and stew about it for a few days, until I remember that every laptop in the computer lab has at least one camera on it. It's a public space. I have remote control over these because I work in IT and know how to set that stuff up. I remotely lock every machine, and mozy on downstairs and my neighbour is trying to mash the keyboard trying to figure out why it's not working anymore and suddenly. I walked over, unplugged it right away, and removed it, along with every single laptop out of the lab, and left behind a note saying that due to condo bylaws, any electronic device with a forward facing camera is not allowed. I advised him that someone complained about my doorbell camera and as such I'm just enforcing the bylaws.",

        "text": "This was back when I (33f) was in 6th grade (11 years old). I don’t know why I just thought of it now but assume it would fit here. It’s a long post so tl:dr at the end. \n\nI performed very well in school which led to me being in higher grade level classes in a few subjects. By 6th grade, I ended up being bussed to high school for half of my school day. Due to the weird scheduling, I had to ride a bus full of alternative high school students. These were students who were considered trouble makers and were expelled from or had failed regular school. \n\nI was very noticeably an outsider: small, quiet, always reading, and at least 5 years younger than anyone else. Cue the bullying. The worst was this girl who was 17 and looked absolutely colossal to me at the time. (I was 4’9”/145cm) She and about 5 other girls would sit around me and relentlessly mock me, yell at me, try to threaten me, and just generally made my time on that bus a very frightening, nightmarish experience. I never acknowledged them nor made any eye contact.\n\nAfter about 3 months of this, the main bully finally snapped. She grabbed me by the shoulders and yanked me out of my seat to the bus aisle. She then screamed, “Look at me when I f***ing talk to you you stupid c**t.” I was terrified and just knew she was getting ready to beat the snot out of me. I thought of any way I could deescalate the situation and played the only card I could. \n\n(Necessary background info: a few years prior to this my cousin started losing her hearing. She and I learned ASL together and were fluent-aside from some grammar issues-by the time I was 11.)\n\nSo this girl managed to say the best phrase possible: “Look at me when I talk to you.” My brain somehow went… use sign language!!!!! I frantically started signing. She immediately backed up with her hands in the air, and every single person on the bus just stared at her. \n\nThen 3 senior boys came up and told her something like, “Don’t pick on deaf kids,” but much more colorfully. The boys kicked all of the other bullies out of the seats around me, and one of them sat down with me and helped me calm down using ASL! (I was a crying mess once the confrontation passed.) Turns out he had a little sister who was deaf. I didn’t correct his assumption that I was also hard of hearing. \n\nFor the rest of the school year those boys would wait outside the bus for me, escort me to my seat, sit with me, and talk to me in ASL. They also made a point to loudly say (and sign along for my benefit) things similar to, “only worthless, pathetic, nobodies would resort to bullying deaf little girls” whenever any of my bullies were present. \n\nI never told anyone on that bus I could hear them and continued to let my bullies suffer. \n\nTL:DR— 11yo me was bullied by group of 16-18yo girls every day on bus. I always ignored them until one day it got physical. I frantically started using ASL and gained myself some 18yo protectors (one of them had a little sister who was deaf) who thought I was also deaf. They guarded me and teased my bullies the rest of the year. I never told them I could hear.",

        "text": "TLDR: My old Roomate got accused of stealing by his terrible boss, she wouldn’t/couldn’t prove it because he asked for the footage she said no(it didn’t exist), yet he wasn’t fired for “stealing”,….so he got her fired by placing a fake order that cost the restaurant 9k in losses. \n\nSo as the title says this isn’t my story but my old Roomate back in my college days. He worked at a popular restaurant in a touristy spot in LA. \nHe worked in the kitchen and wanted to move up to become server. The manager who hired him left and someone was brought in. The person I’ll call Ann, and my Roomate I’ll call Mike. Ann would hire her 2 friends as servers and Mike said  they were the spoiled never had a job kind of college kids.\n\nMike would do serving(he’s had experience for years being a waiter) if someone called out and or to train new people. He never got a promotion or even a chance, nor a raise and said he wasn’t allowed to take tips. He has more patience than me obviously because I would have just quit lol. \n\nThis went on for about a year.\nThe place is full of cameras, he got accused of stealing tips, Mike obviously denied this, he said when he did wait on tables and if a customer handed him tips directly he’d pocket them, that’s not stealing.\n\nMike told me he told Ann to check the cameras, she said No, you owe the servers(her friends)…all the nonsense you’d tell an employee that’s said by incompetent ppl who will get your company in a nasty lawsuit. He clearly didn’t want to take this route and clearly she was not good or experienced enough to run a whole restaurant I guess he wanted to prove it. \n\nI even suggested he call HR, labor board etc. nope, I guess he wanted it his way. Lol\n\nAfter being repeatedly accused of stealing, I told him, clearly they have no proof, or else you’d be fired, they’re playing you. \n(In my personal opinion I think they just wanted him to be the person at the restaurant who does everything like serve, dish wash etc, and her friends get his tips. Idk how illegal this is, but it seems very. He def. Could have sued if he wanted to.)\n\nHe then said Ima get her fired. The reason he wanted to keep his job is b/c he loved his coworkers and job, just a bad manager. Again, the company was really strict, there were coworkers of his who was fired for taking food and they were caught on camera(go figure, but they wouldn’t fire him for stealing actual money??? fishy AF!) \n\nMany offices and studios would call to get food for the office or crew for take out. I’m not sure if they required CC cards or not, but what ever the case, she dropped the ball, and just went with the honor system of if they’re calling to order they’ll be here to pay. \n\nMy Roomate had the bright idea of calling on behalf of a customer who orders regularly for their office and studio, he said they’d spend a couple thousand each time. He said he’s gonna call on behalf of that company, jokingly. He was telling me and a few friends in a group setting, so we said let’s do it, but triple the order, he wanted one of us to call so no one would recognize his voice. He told our friend to do it, told her everything and when they read the total it came up close to 9k. And to make it even funnier, it was one of her hired friends who took the order, a catering order for the next week. \n\nHe told us normally orders of this size have to be ordered in advanced and paid in advanced. But the terrible manager got no CC on file, her hired friend didn’t care or possibly didn’t know. The day comes and he said he’s at work and the company is late for the pick up time. \n\nShe even had kitchen staff come in early to work on this big order she was bragging about for week. He said she was gloating and saying she’s gonna have the highest grossing store in the region and hopefully will get a shout out in their little corporate notices that go out. The uptake in revenue was going to make her look good in corporates eye b/c they always wanted to up the sells.\n\n(I would also like to mention, many ppl at his job hated Ann, they either quit or complained to hr, or asked to be transferred to a different location. )\n\nThe manager Ann calls the company, they’re clueless said they didn’t place an order…and that’s that for them. Mike said when Ann hung up the phone she was just silent and turned red and went to her office. \n\nThe next week, they had a new manager from another location, her friends she hired quit by never showing back up to work, they weren’t missed as they didn’t do anything anyways. \n\nThe last Mike told me about the girl Ann was showing me a screen shot of her FB status saying she’s looking for a good lawyer to sue the restaurant. Idk what happened with that. But by the post I’m sure she was fired(sarcasm)…I’m sure she was fired lol.\n\nMy old Roomate Mike got promoted to server after asking the new manager, he told me that the guy said of course. \n\nIt was a simple solution that when my Roomate acted worked in a week. \n\nHe’s since left the company. \n\nWhile it’s never funny having someone lose their job, it’s technically her fault, she should have required payment, and especially upon seeing an order that large she, as the manager should have called the company that so-called placed the order to confirm and get payment, problem would have gotten solved then and there. But I like to thank Mike just sped up the inevitable.",

He cheated multiple times when I told him no and to stop but that did not stop him. I broke up with him after a year and a half of being together after I got proof that he was cheating on me. Anyways after we broke up he went around my whole town showing people my nudes (never knew he had any of my nudes) and telling everyone how much of a whore I was. (He took my first time) after I sat and cried for a little bit it was time for revenge. I shared all of his usernames, passwords and email to anyone that would get on a online chat (Omegle) I also sent a ton of them his phone number along with his name. I know very petty of me but oh well I was 15/16. So for 6 months people where hacking his Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and even his twitter. He called me multiple times cussing me out apparently someone signed him up for a whole bunch of explicit website attached his phone number to a whole bunch spam calls. But technically I never did any of that he could never prove it. He ended up having to change his number and make all new accounts. And I heard he busted his phone that had my nudes on it. I honestly don’t feel that bad about it but I know it was a shitty thing to do.\n\nBy the way… \nI did not send him those nudes nor did I take nudes at that age I didn’t want see my body in a image like that. Plus I wasn’t thinking about being sexy or hot. I was 15/16 and a major tomboy.\nI’m not emotionally scared from this, yes I was shaken up from this for a while. It’s in the past worse things have happened to me than this. \nHave a great night!",

        "text": "My kiddo is quadriplegic/non-verbal. An absolute hoot, funny, and snarky even just with facial expressions. So we (me, the kiddo, and his nurse) went to the derm's office. First off, the front desk was nasty about his wheelchair (can you make sure he doesn't track in mud? Don't hit the wall, we will charge you for that, sort of thing) We complied but didn't respond.  (ps- this was YEARS ago)\n\nFrustrated but still wanting to figure out what my kid's scary skin issue was, we remained.  Waited over 1 3/4 hours, folks going in that JUST arrived, etc.  Finally, we get a room.  The office nurse is rude and dismissive. We wait another hour or so.  \n\nThe \"doctor\" upon entering the examination room made a disgusted face and said, \"yech, another retard. why do I have to deal with RETARDS?\"\n\nI lost it.  My son lost it (he might not be able to speak but he sure as hell comprehends every word spoken!)\n\nOur nurse held me back from decking the assh@t, and said (clear as day) \"Don't worry. I'm taping this whole appointment. We can use this to sue his ass.\"  Dr Derm was nasty to our nurse, literally making a crap ton of racist comments.  This time I DID lose it. I told him to take a good long look around at his world because I was going to make it go away (yes, clearly I cussed him up one side and back down the other as well as got millimeters away from him without touching him to bellow into his racist ass, but honestly, do we need to go into that?)\n\nHe sent 2 people to follow us to my car-  we realized it and spoke frankly to them.  Apparently, our nurse was STILL taping everything. They admitted Dr told them to harass us and get our plate info.  Apparently, he has a friend/relative in the police that could make out life terrible.  \n\nGot home, spoke to the insurance company, and played the video.  Up the chain of command for almost 2 weeks and POOF! I did this for every health insurance company in our county (what can I say? I'm a devoted mom).\n\nAfter 4 weeks of work, Dr derm no longer had insurance patients.  I got confirmation letters of his provider denial from all but 2 of the medical insurers in the US.\n\nDr Derm was then a cash-only office.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has been about 15 years.  He retired 3 years after our visit to his office.  He was in his early 40's.\n\nEff you for calling my kid a retard.  Eff your whole life.  \n\nAs a farewell gift, I sent him a huge packet of all the letters from insurance providers, stating he will no longer have insurance patients  (based on his medical license #) and a copy of the highlights of his visit with my son and the folks who followed us.",

        "text": "I've got this big-ass house, you know the kind - old Victorian style that I restored myself after inheriting it... So this summer, this old couple moves in across the street and starts freaking out about everything I do. They don't like the siding I'm putting on, they think my front door color is ugly, they hate all the different colored flowers I planted. And they really don't like the idea of a young, single woman living in a house they think I can't afford - they actually told me that.\n\nBut I tried to ignore them and not let their negativity get to me. Every holiday was a new opportunity for them to gripe about something, and Halloween was no exception. I was getting excited to start putting up my decorations and planning my costume, but I knew the old couple would probably find something to complain about.\n\nAs Halloween approached, I started to notice that the old couple was becoming more and more agitated. They kept muttering to themselves and shaking their heads whenever they saw me outside. I couldn't figure out what was going on, but I had a feeling it had something to do with the holiday.\n\nI decided to try and get back at them by leaving little gifts on their doorstep. I left them a pumpkin spice candle, some spooky cookie cutters, and a bag of candy corn. I hoped that these gestures would show them that Halloween could be a fun and positive holiday.\n\nBut no matter what I did, they just couldn't seem to let go of their grudge. Every time I saw them, they would scowl and shake their heads at my decorations. I knew I had to come up with a more creative solution.\n\nOn Halloween night, I knew it was time to make my move. I had been planning this for weeks, and I was determined to get my petty revenge.\n\nI made a batch of soap with the inscription \"boo hoo\" on the front and \"fuck you\" on the back, and left it on the old couple's doorstep with a note that said \"I hope you can appreciate the sentiment.\"\n\nI didn't stick around to see their reaction, but I couldn't help but hope that they would accept the gift as a sign of my goodwill. I knew it was a petty gesture, but I just couldn't resist the urge to get back at them for all their negativity.\n\nAs I walked away, I couldn't help but smile to myself. I had finally stood up for myself and given those old grumps a piece of my mind. And even though I knew it wouldn't really change anything, it felt good to let out a little bit of my frustration.",

        "text": "So, my (45F) story is an epilogue to my marriage to a narcissistic ex (42M). I haven't posted about my terrible marriage yet, but it will be on the r/NarcissisticAbuse page.\n\nMy NEX was and still is a piece of work. He has already found his next victim. She is ten years younger and eager to have kids. Because of their religious backgrounds, they must get married to have said kids and get to live together.\n\nI was really hurt by all the things he did to me. I was being gaslit about everything. I was a confident, successful, and pretty girl when we met. He turned me into a timid sorry excuse of a human being who would apologize for no reason whatsoever.  In the end, when I was so emotionally withdrawn and not caring about anything anymore, he was accusing me of cheating on him.\n\nI couldn't help but laugh because I had lost all faith in men and didn't believe myself able to be attractive enough to gain anyone's attention. During the last 10 years, I had gained more than 40 kilos and he would repeatedly say he didn't find me attractive, he didn't touch me for 2 years of our marriage. During my two pregnancies, he would also stop touching me.\n\nI was in a state of mind where I thought this would be my end. I didn't know how I could live the rest of my life in a loveless, sexless, careless marriage. My only sanctuary was my work. I never knew what kind of hell he would serve me when I got home. \n\nWhen I finally got my ducks in order and got the balls to call it quits, he made the mandatory 180, but when pressured he would go back to gaslighting and being aggressive toward me. I kept firm and strong and never gave him the impression that there was even a little chance of us getting back together.\n\nI got into therapy and started working on myself. I got stronger and suddenly the old confident girl came back to the surface. He moved on pretty quickly. His friends told me he was on tinder and dating. They were poking to find out if I was dating or not. I know they were doing it on his behalf. I denied everything. Some of them even asked me out, some of his closest friends!!!!! I knew it was a plot from his side to test me.\n\nWhen he comes to our old home, he acts like he still has a say in what I do. And he acts like it is still his home, going from one room to another, and mostly attacking my bedroom as if I am hiding some man in there. And when he doesn't see any signs of a new man, he starts boasting about his new relationship. How sweet she is. Thin, long legs, good in bed. How much money he makes now, and how all that money could have been mine instead of hers.  (Seriously she has NOTHING on me, he doesn't either). \n\nWhat I learned from my therapist is not to engage in any kind of banter or discussion. Even though I want to rip him a new one. So, I keep quiet, use an indifferent tone, and seem bored or like I don't understand what he is talking about. I keep it about co-parenting and don't comment on anything else.\n\nHe makes it sound like I wouldn't get anyone as good as him financially, sexually, or status-wise.\n\nAfter the rant about his prowess, he seems satisfied and leaves. And I am left fuming, but I have to keep it together in order to work him the way my therapist has advised. For the sake of my children I do this. My way of reacting to all his poking is the grey rock method. Then he finds me stupid and boring and leaves me alone.\n\nI don't recommend anyone doing what I did, but it helped me immensely!!!! I feel so light, and I can't help smirk every time he is here talking about how good and perfect everything is for him. I am on top of the world, and he has no clue.\n\nI knew he really liked the bed we had together. It was made especially for him by his physiotherapist. It is a specially customized bed, that molds to his body and back. He has a lot of screentime at work so his back and neck hurt a lot.\n\nI was on tinder for a while but never used it. But last week I hooked up with three different guys and had an F-fest in the bed. One of the guys was even 20 years my junior!!!! And he had the stamina of one such. I was effed for 4 hours straight. At the end of the last date, I even thought there would be an imprint of my body on the mattress. A lot of bodily fluids were left as \"souvenirs\" for the new couple. And the top cover cannot come off and be cleaned unless you change the whole mattress.\n\nI called him and said that I know he really values his bed, and there is no need for him to buy a new one. He got really happy and thanked me for the offer. He came to pick it up with a friend. \n\nIt makes me so happy to know that he and the new GF is sleeping and effing on that bed that I baptized with my hook-ups.",

        "text": "In the Summer of '07 in Dublin, I, a 16 year old closeted gay, was spending the night at my childhood best friend's house for a sleepover. We were up all night gaming, and I was the last one awake. I went to the kitchen to grab a drink before bed and my friends older brother was there. We stayed up chatting and he ended up kissing me. After a minute or so of kissing he pushed me away and ran into the living room where my friends were asleep shouting 'Your F-Slur friend just tried to kiss me. Keep that F-Slur away from me'. I could do nothing but stare in shock and from my expression my friends all assumed it to be true. Knowing anything I said would be thought of as a lie, I apologised and said it wouldn't happen again. Luckily my friends weren't dicks about it and most thought I was gay anyway so there wasn't much fallout bar the odd quip about me keeping my hands to myself. Regardless I still wanted to metaphorically bitch slap him and decided to plot my revenge. \n\nAs I had spent a lot of my childhood in their house I knew where everything was, including the stuff that I shouldn't! In a drawer of a desk in their spare room, they kept envelopes, each with 5 euro in it, that were to be given to the church at the end of the year. This was to be vital to my plot.\n\nMy fellow gamers might recall that the PS5 was released in '07, and my friends brother had been saving up his allowance for months to buy one.  When the day finally came that he had enough money I made my move. I stole all the envelopes, ripped them open, took the cash and left the ripped envelopes in the closet in his bedroom. A few days past and I feared my plan had failed but the next time I went over to my friends house he told me the most delicious story. His mother had found the envelopes in his room and went ballistic. He 'lied' and said he had no clue how they got there but noone believed him and they assumed he had stolen the money to buy his shiny new ps3. He was forced to return it and was made give all the money back to the church. \n\nTil this day noone knows the true tale of where the church money went and his family always looked down on him for stealiing from the church. I wish I could say I was a good person and at least gave the money back to the church but that would he a lie. I kept that stash hidden and 'saved my money' until me having it wasn't suspect and karmically used it to buy my very own ps3.",
