My car insurance is $300/month. My internet is $138/m and phone bill is $38/m. Streaming services and tv come to $34/m. I occassionly have to drive long distances to go to work and gas cost me $200 this month.\n\n$2440 with out food\n\nI am currently the only finacial income and support my husband. He cant work yet because he is American and doesnt have his work visa in yet. I am about to go on medication that cost about $80 a week. We have been losing money every month and are as frugal as we can be. (No going out, havent bought ourselves anything unessecary)\n\nWhat should I do to not sink closer to debt every month? I love my job and my husband I just dont know what to do. I appreciate your suggestions and thank you for reading and responding. \n\nTLDR: what can I do to finacially support my family when my living bills cost more then my income?",

But I want to turn the other pair into shorts. \n\nWhy ruin a perfectly good pair of pants? Because I have a job that requires a lot of walking, lifting, bending, and squatting in a fairly stuffy building. I get sweaty a LOT, and thankfully I am allowed to wear shorts. My current pairs are falling apart, but are still holding on in the meantime (I can do a few basic stitches here and there). \n\nHow do I turn these pants into a pair of shorts, that don't look ratchet af? I'm scared of ruining them since they're not made of denim or normal thick material. \n\nAny tips would be appreciated :)",

        "text": "I’ve had Verizon for some time now and have been considering switching since they got rid of the 5gb prepaid plan (I don’t use much data so no need for unlimited) The 5gb plan was $25 a month and now I’m paying $35 a month for the 15gb plan where I’m lucky if I even use half that data in a month. So I thought I’d ask this sub what frugal phone plans you’ve been able to find. I’ll list down below some of the things I’m looking for in a phone plan and would love to know what’s been working for you or any suggestions you may have.\n\nMy current phone is an unlocked iPhone XS so not capable of 5G although I’ll probably get a 5G phone in the next few years. My husband currently has a 5G capable unlocked phone. I’m looking for a prepaid plan, if I can get a discount for having two lines even better. I think around 10gb of data would be more than enough for both of us. I’ve never had a shared data plan but I’d be open to it if it’s worth it. We’re located in western NC not sure which provider is best for coverage in that area but my husband does travel up and down the east coast for work occasionally. I’m okay with not going with a main provider such as (Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-mobile) as long as it has comparable coverage. Doesn’t matter if it’s cheaper if you never have service, you know?\n\nWhat do you all think? Is it worth switching? Right now I’m paying $70 a month for two lines with 15gb and unlimited talk and text.\n\nAlso, advice from anyone who has switched from Verizon to another plan. Were you able to keep the same phone number? That would be a big plus.\n\nSorry for the long post but thank you in advance for any advice or insight you’re able to offer. I’ve done some research on other providers but don’t want to commit to switching until I get some feedback on them first.",

        "text": "I've been trying to follow a very low budget for fast food this past week for myself ($10) and it has oddly went very well so far. I don't feel like I'm missing out on not getting more food each time I get fast food now. \n\nI actually found out recently I lost over 10 pounds (so close to fitting into clothes I haven't worn in forever) and since I'm trying to eat better by cooking at home more, I'm trying to eat less when it comes to fast food, naturally. \n\nHowever, sometimes it's nice to have something like fast food every once in awhile. I'm finding I'm starting to enjoy it more when I do have the small amount I get in an order of what I want vs getting the typical full meal because it's \"easier\". \n\nOn Tuesday I got the jbc from Wendy's and a medium fry since the burger was free with a fry purchase. It was actually pretty filling for my lunch until I got home from work. That was $3.28. \n\nToday I had a reward pop up for a free 5 count nugget from chick fil a and I got a second 5 count nugget because I saw it wasn't very expensive ($3), paying $3.30 total. I also got a free ice water. It was filling at least until lunch when I made something at home (I got this in the morning around 8am)\n\nAnd now I see this awesome deal from Wendy's for the weekend where you can get 50% off a kids meal. A cheeseburger kids meal is pretty similar to the 4 for $4 meal (the cheeseburger one, all the other ones for my area are now $5). A cheeseburger with a fry, Jr frosty, and soda for $2.37 is a steal! I know what I'm getting for lunch tomorrow!\n\nI'm starting to not crave it like I used to and it's nice not getting it all the time, but enjoying it in small doses.\n\nI think paying this is pretty reasonable for the week and hopefully these apps continue to have deals on fast food that make it a little more affordable. It's absolutely ridiculous paying $10+ for a simple meal otherwise. Sometimes I just want the burger and don't need a huge soda or giant fry.",

        "text": "This one is mostly for the ladies. While I love the “self care” bandwagon, I’m sure we’re all aware of how pricey these products and services can be. I do splurge as we all deserve to treat ourselves from time to time, but I do my best to find products that get the job done and give me the best bang for my buck. With that being said, here’s my regimen.\n\nNails: GEL @ Home. I bought everything from Amazon. I do overlay on natural nail but you can apply tips for length. You can learn to do this on YouTube or TikTok. \n\nPedicures: I do these at home as well. Soak in some epsom salt and scrub/trim away. Dehydrate w acetone/alcohol, paint, top coat. Basic tools for less than $10 from Walmart or Dollar tree. Such as pumice stone, cuticle trimmer, files, etc. Be sure to moisturize after!\n\nMakeup: I don’t buy duplicates or high end.\nI have one of each item and do the same “soft glam” look every day. My lashes really elevate this.\n\nLashes: I buy Kiss #11 lashes and apply them in sections with Kiss falscara underneath my top lashes. This hides the band and they look like extensions. I wear each pair for 2 days. 5 pair pack is $9. \n\nFragrance: Dossier! These perfumes last all day and are dupes for high end fragrances. I don’t waste my time with body sprays or scented lotions.\n\nBody: \nBody Wash/Soap: Aveeno Skin Relief Fragrance Free Body Wash - 33oz for $10-$11. *ladies this is also PH friendly so no need to worry about irritating your area* \nI wash with exfoliating mitt. If you choose bar soap I highly recommend getting a soap pouch to hang your soap and avoid waste.\n\nDeodorant: Mitchum Women’s Solid - 3 Pack for $13-$15. Hard to find in my area I usually order on Amazon. \n\nBody Moisturizer: I use Jojoba oil but baby oil is good too! I apply with continuous spray bottle. If you’re new to body oil I recommend applying when you’re still damp after turning off shower. \n\nShaving / Hair Removal:\nI shave with body wash, but I do like the Tree Hut Shave Oil. I use the Leaf razor with the pivoting head. It was $85 I believe, but it will last a lifetime and the blades are extremely cheap. It takes 3 blades which I change weekly. You could have new blades every shave for 15 cents! You can purchase a pack of half blades on Amazon for 4-5 cents each so roughly $5 for a 100 pack. \n\nI pluck my own brows, but I also have a wax warmer I’ve owned for years. Literally 10 years. I use that for my lip and eyebrows on occasion. You can also buy wax strips for lip &amp; brow at the drugstore. Don’t pay $15+ for threading or a wax! \n\nOral:\nArm &amp; Hammer Advanced White Toothpaste - 4 pack for $12 on Amazon.\n\nI’m not big on mouthwash but I keep some around. I buy whichever is cheapest per oz. \n\nPlus White Whitening Gel - $6-$8 available at Walmart or Amazon. This tube lasts me like the entire year and works just as well as whitening strips. I don’t do 5 min I do like 20 min. You can use daily until you’re to a level you like and then do weekly to maintain. Use retainers or make your own trays by boiling cheap mouth guards. \n\nSkincare:\nCeraVe SA Cleanser - $16 for large but will last up to 6 months.\n\nNeutrogena Hydro Boost SPF 30 Sunscreen &amp; Moisturizer - $11 at Walmart.\n\nAdapalene - $30 on Amazon. This is a retinoid, not necessary, but great for your skin. I don’t have health insurance so this is the best OTC alternative to tretinoin. \n\nI also use my Jojoba oil on my face in the evening as it is noncomedogenic and an anti-fungal.\n\nFeminine:\nI use a menstrual cup. Be sure to boil in the evening when you shower to avoid any odor or bacteria build up.\n\nI take vH Essentials Prebiotic &amp; Probitoic every other day - $9 at Walmart. \n\nIf I have any issues I take an apple cider vinegar bath or use boric acid suppositories. Don’t waste your money on the drugstore yeast treatments.\n\nHair: \nI have solid brown hair so I can get by with box dye but I don’t color often. I might step into a salon once a year and spend less than $100 on an all over color. I need to buy better quality shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I’m cheap. I use a cheap leave in conditioner and heat protectant before I use my Revlon blow dry brush to style. \n\nThat’s my very thorough self care routine. It’s not over the top but keeps me feeling good and looking maintained without breaking the bank.",

I've heard arguments about these things not being food safe after a while which doesn't make much sense to me when we utilize plastic Tupperware. I feel like the whole idea of these things being disposable is to benefit the companies that produce them and keep those profits high.",

I'm looking at a full size frame ($160 US) and mattress ($340 US), about 500 before tax. This is about the extent of what I can afford at this time, and at 500-ish total that doesn't seem too bad. But I could be wrong, and I'd rather not be. \n\nAnyone have pricing suggestions, not just for mattresses, but for any kind of item that falls in that \"don't cheap out\" category?",
