I had a question about polyunsaturated fats and why they are generally considered to be healthier. My line of thinking makes sense in my mind but I want to know if the conclusion I came up with is valid. I am not finding any answers to my questions online. \n\nQuestion: Is the reason why polyunsaturated fats are considered healthier because of the fact that the kinks in the fatty acid tail from the carbon double-bonds makes it harder for plaque to build up in the walls of the arteries (the same way that unsaturated fats become less viscous at room temperature), and in the same vein, do they help lower cholesterol because the carbon in the fatty acid tails can more easily pick up cholesterol?\n\nIf this is weirdly worded, or you need any clarification on my question, feel free to let me know!",

        "text": "The new tool, called Metabolic Network Analysis (MNA), is based on a technique known as network analysis. This approach allows researchers to map the interactions between different nutrients and metabolic pathways in order to understand how they interact with each other. By mapping out these networks, MNA can identify which dietary components are most likely to affect disease risk by influencing cancer cell metabolism.\n\n\nThe team used their MNA model to analyse data from over 3 million cells across 15 different types of cancers and healthy tissues. They found that certain combinations of dietary fats were associated with increased risk for some cancers while others had no effect or even decreased the risk for those same cancers when consumed together in specific ratios.\" \n\n\n\nThis research provides an important step forward towards understanding how diet affects health outcomes at a molecular level – something that has been difficult until now due to the complexity of metabolic processes involved in nutrition-related diseases like cancer. With this knowledge, scientists can begin designing tailored diets for individuals depending on their genetic makeup and personal history – helping them make informed decisions about what foods will best support their health goals without risking unnecessary harm through trial-and-error approaches or ‘one size fits all’ advice from general practitioners!\n\n\n\n\nResearchers have mapped the effects of dietary nutrients on disease to better understand how nutrition can be used to prevent and treat various diseases[1][2][3].\n\n\nFor example, a study published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that skipping meals, fasting, and eating meals too close together may be linked to increased cardiovascular or all-cause mortality [4].\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also provides interactive data on nutrition-related topics such as breastfeeding, fruits and vegetables, physical activity, sugary drinks, television viewing and nutrition. obesity/weight[5]. These data can help researchers better understand the relationship between diet and health outcomes.\n\n\n\nOverall, researchers continue to map the effects of dietary nutrients on disease to better understand how nutrition can be used to improve health outcomes.[1][2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\nFrederick Clasen, first author and joint Ph.D. student at Crick and King's College London, said: “The potential applications of this work are considerable. We can now see which changes in diet have a real impact on cellular metabolism, and which have very little effect because cells are already programmed to draw missing nutrients from their surroundings.\"",
