I have the history of our farm from 1882 to present. There have been multiple deaths on the property, most notably in 1943 when a house on the property 100 feet away from ours burned and killed a little girl and her mother.

        "text": "This all happened back in 1985 and 1986 but these are things that my friend and I will never forget.\n\nI was working the summers at an old retreat in the North Carolina mountains with about 50 other young adults. It was great fun. While the place had lots of modern buildings it was ruled over by a hulking white building built in 1912. I think it's important to note that most of the building is just an extension of the mountain itself. It was built using the trees from right where it stands as well as the rocks and boulders used for the foundation. It's three stories, but really 5 counting the basement and the attic full of bats. It was great watching them pour out of there every night. The front of the building is an enormous portico with white columns stretching up all three stories. That porch is full of rocking chairs from which you can see a majestic view of the Smokey Mountains.\n\nBut the back of that building us where we worked. The back of the building was hugged by two large wings, forming a U shape back there. We entered our housekeeping facilities via a fire escape that stretched straight up to the second floor rear entrance: a single green, metal door.\n\nThat door was one I knew well. Housekeeping was my department for 3 summers and even though this was now just the end of the first summer, I was well acquainted with it. It was big, green, metallic, and heavy as shit, with a pull on the outside and a bar to push on the inside to open it. It did not stay open. In fact fire regulations required it to stay closed at all times and it was engineered to shut automatically.  So of course during the summer with no air conditioning in the building we kept it propped open with a full bucket of water during the day, regulations be damned.\n\nSorry this is long but I feel like all this info is important. \n\nA few nights before we all left we were cleaning our dorms and trying to turn it into a party when we all ran put of cleaning supplies. So around 9 o'clock at night my best friend and I drive our lazy asses down to the back of the building. It was only a short distance but there was a very steep incline we didn't want to walk.\n\nI parked my car right in front of the stairs and we get out.  At this point we both began to feel odd. The air was still and stuffy and I felt positively enveloped by this building, standing in the middle with those massive wings rising around us. The building was completely dark and since we had been shutting it down for winter it was already locked up tight. My friend had been with me earlier in the day when I had locked that door. The one at the top of the stairs.\n\nAs we climbed the stairs I felt positively oppressed and had to stop. My friend did too. I told him I was scared and he admitted the same.  I had never felt scared of this building before and I had spent plenty of time in it alone, exploring the basement and attic. \n\nWe pressed slowly forward again and a few steps up I literally felt an icy chill down my spine. I know it's a stupid cliche but I've never felt anything like it before or since. Like someone pressed an icicle down the length of my spine.\n\nFinally we reached the top of the stairs and the instant I put my foot on the top landing that freaking door swung open wide and stood open for us, revealing the short entranceway bathed in the red light of the exit sign.  It wanted us in there and we both felt it, but it did not feel welcoming at all. In fact, I've never been more scared of anything in my life. I get freaked out about it now, 37 years later.\n\nWe both just stood there completely stunned for what felt like minutes before I completely freaked out, started screaming incoherently,  and scrambled down the steps, jumping way too many on the way down. We both ran up the steep incline yelling and screaming, leaving my car behind. lol\n\nEveryone came down and searched the building with us. It was empty of course and the door was shut fast and locked when we got back. No one could have pushed that door open and run away without us hearing them. The floors squeaked when you walked on them and someone running would have been very loud. I have looked at this from every angle I can think of but I still have no explanation for what happened.\n\nI worked there for 3 more summers in that building and have more stories if interested.  My friend stayed to work through the winter one year and saw the hat man in the same building. \n\nI hope this isn't too long for this sub. Kinda new to Reddit still.",

And sounds from the walls in the bathroom near the stairs to the basement and the walls going down to the basement. My headaches have increased to migraines 2-3 times a week now. \n\nOur house was one of the first house built in the town we live in and on this huge river that goes to the Mississippi.

        "text": " (I‚Äôm not sure if this is allowed, if not please delete. I just don‚Äôt know what else to do.)\n\n\nI guess I‚Äôll start at the beginning. I‚Äôve always been interested in the paranormal. I (20f) have always been inquisitive about it, and liked to have it disproven if possible. I‚Äôm a skeptic to a point where I can‚Äôt explain, or at least I used to be.\n\n Around six or seven years ago I started noticing weird things around my house. It started with sounds when no one was around. People out of the corner of my eye, things moving. This thing or things followed me to two different houses. It fluctuated with intensity until one night two years ago. \n\n We had just come back from the city to get the bulk of our groceries for the month, when my father slammed on the brakes. He and I both watched as a dog like creature slipped into the ditch and disappeared into the trees. Recanting the story later he described it on its hind two legs as it started to cross the road. Where I saw it on all fours when it left the road. To this day we don‚Äôt know what it was. This alone scared me but it wasn‚Äôt till a month later when it started getting dangerous.\n\n It was very late again and I was driving home with just my brother in my car. We had the windows down (because my car was crap and my air conditioning was broke lol). On a particularly flat stretch of the road a loud cracking sound came from my door. I swerved slightly as it scared me from just the vibrations. The dent was just below the window. I‚Äôm not proud to say I sped home and locked the door to the house so fast. My brother and I were so freaked out and I cried with relief when my parents came home a little while later. Just for information I was already going 45ish down this road. So whatever hit my car had great aim, and I really don‚Äôt what‚Äôs to think about what would have happened if it had hit me. \n\n Our house security cameras had captured many ghost lights and other videos that were unexplainable. One particular sign wound fall off the wall no matter what we would do to keep it on. Everyone started hearing things and people that weren‚Äôt there. Instruments mainly, but during our final months, I started hearing members of our family calling or talking in different rooms. \n\n This freaked me out the most because it seemed like I was being called to something that wasn‚Äôt good. I was walking to my parents room when I passed the open basement, and It sounded like my brother was talking to someone but having a weird one sided conversation. I found myself descending the stairs before my brother called from my parents room. \n\n After moving away nothing has happened in the new house, and we aren‚Äôt in the middle of nowhere anymore. We however have a house backed up to a very forested area. A week a after we moved in we were in the back yard installing a fence, when in the woods behind my house we heard a slow howl that turned into a yell. It was so loud and primal that we quickly finished and went inside. \n\n Now I‚Äôve noticed some knocking going on inland things being misplaced. I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs starting again. What do I do?                         \n\n(I apologize for any spelling mistakes my internet sucks and autocorrets not being kind to me)",

        "text": "I have had experiences in the past with what I think are signs, but usually bad omens - one of them being a mourning dove visiting my open apartment window and sitting there for 30 minutes after I was given a death threat by someone who was stalking me. This had never happened with any bird in the 3 years I lived there - the dove stared right into my eyes and didn't flinch when I put my hand a near it. I was trying to figure out if I should follow my stalker's demands or not - I decided not to and now 2 years later I no longer am being stalked. No one died either. \n\nRecently, I have been in a relationship where I have gotten a gut feeling that something wasn't right. I found out he had been cheating with girls online and that he bullies coworkers and classmates for fun. I live with him and while I was away for Thanksgiving break, I got angry about the direction my life is going with him and now want to end the relationship. I have been extremely nervous about how to have this confrontation and it is currently a bad time due to there being a death in his family. But I have been constantly thinking about secretly packing up my stuff and just leaving a letter about the cheating on his desk - however, he's always home and it's hard.\n\nToday, while I was at the funeral for his relative, I was feeling very uncomfortable being there and dissociating badly. I kept thinking about how I want to leave him before Christmas. I was sitting eating in the church after the funeral and stood up - my leg was asleep and I was expecting the blood to just flow back like it usually does when I stand up. But I blacked out for a few seconds - I apparently collapsed really hard on the ground. All I remember is looking at my swollen ankle and groaning in pain. I had badly sprained it - I have never sprained nor broken anything in my body before. I was shocked because I had stood up with my leg asleep many times before without a problem. I had to be rushed back to our house and I am now in bed. I can't go back to work and can barely walk to the bathroom. \n\nI have a feeling this was some sign - especially considering it happened in a sacred place and around a time where I am dealing with both his family's grief and my feelings about the relationship. I don't know what to think of it. But I need help - perhaps I'm being told to not leave the relationship now or that it is going to be dangerous for me to leave the relationship in general. Is there any information on the paranormal that talks about injuring oneself in a sacred place or around the time of a specific event and what that means?",

Keep in mind, we live in an pretty big apartment, and to get to my sister's room you need to pass by one additional room, boiler room and a long corridor with a spare kitchen. Then you reach her room. We heard them talking like usually, being excited about the match but we didn't pay much attention to it. Then we heard her both, clear and loud calling out like usual \"Mom!\", which wasn't out of ordinary since she already called her like that maybe 10 minutes prior. My mom asked \"what?\" and then made her way to my sister's room. They talked and she came back, saying \"your sister didn't call me or even said anything at all, she is eating now\". We just looked at each other and as swore we heard my sister calling. What could have that been?",

        "text": "This is a story I‚Äôve told many times over the years but never posted anywhere: Ok so this was an experience shared between me and one of my older brothers. I was 12 and he was 15. I am now 30 but this experience has stayed with me. Here we go. Bear with me. \n\nFor some foundation on the story; My brother had gotten angry at my mom not ordering him Wendy‚Äôs for dinner so he wanted to rebel and storm out of the house and I just wanted to follow. We lived in a nice and quiet suburb a few miles outside of Philadelphia Pennsylvania. It was a summer night maybe 930pm or 10pm. The neighborhood was safe so it wasn‚Äôt unusual for us to take night walks from time to time. \n\nWe walked to the neighborhood elementary school that I was actually attending at the time. The walk was about a mile. We get to the school and climb up to the top roof of a newly constructed blue and yellow playground that was maybe 20 feet tall. The playground sat atop a hill. At the base of the hill was a soccer field enclosed with a running track. We would come here maybe once a week and just hang out. \n\nAnyway, we are there for a few minutes when out of seemingly thin air there appeared these three humanoid looking figures dressed in all black standing out on the soccer field in a triangle formation (1 in front 2 in back). The one in front seemed to have broader shoulders than the other two. We both could sense that they were watching us or had their attention on us. These ‚Äúthings‚Äù were not there when we arrived and we were both seeing the same thing.  The moon was out and shining strong so we could see these things even in the night.\n\nWhat happens next is where it gets weird. These things disappeared for a few minutes and then reappeared closer to the base of the hill. They then disappeared and reappeared again further away from the base. They again, did their act again but reappeared in the shape of what seemed like animals. I remember thinking they looked like grazing horses. I should mention they were always completely void of motion almost like statues whether in humanoid or animal form.  Finally, they disappeared and reappeared again but now they were moving and  shaped like black balls of energy. Darker than the night. I‚Äôve always said they looked like gigantic Rollie pollie bugs. Probably the size of large dogs. All three were moving at different paces but all relatively slow. No animal or person would move at the pace or with the cadence these things had.\n\n At some point we climbed down to the ground and stood at the top of the hill to get a better view. We stood there for about 5-10 minutes and these thing move from the field, across the track and begin to ‚Äúcrawl‚Äù up the hill towards us. One of them got within 20 feet of us and we decided to run home before we could find out what they were or what they wanted.\n\nHas anyone heard of or experienced something like this? I‚Äôve heard of skin walkers but those accounts I‚Äôve read about don‚Äôt resemble my and my brothers account. Thanks for reading!",

I told her we never had anything like that neither have I ever heard about that. She looked at me with a confused face, said thank you and walked off. I got back on my ladder and was about to continue my work, but when the woman nearly reached the end of the department, she stopped, turned her head around and said:\"You will be married in 3 years with 5 children.\" She said that in an fast, but calm tone. I looked at her with an confused face, but she already turned around and continued her shopping. Now, if she would have played a prank on me she would avoid going close to me again. Buz she didn't. She walked past me a few times before leaving without saying anything. I will give you an update in 3 years.",

        "text": "It has been a couple of months now that always after 12 am, a smell of something burning would enter my room and when i open my window to confirm the smell because i need to check if something was catching up on fire, the smell would get stronger. It normally lasts for around 10 minutes. \n\nI ignored it for the first couple of months but lately i'm getting annoyed by it so i went to the management, i made a complaint and we went round asking my neighbors if they smelt it and non of them did. He then told me not to take offense but suggested that it could be something that i could've picked up when i was out and about and it has followed me back if it's always happening at the same time, and only i am affected by it. There's no smoke as well, and so there's no way to know where it's coming from.\n\nI did share my problem with several people, and all would suggest that it could be electrical wiring or cigarette or etc and only problem is i know how they all smells like because i've smelt them before. I've smelt many things being burnt before, but for some reason, this is something that i could not tell what it is. After i explained that to them, they would suggest that perhaps it's something else, and when i asked what they meant, they wouldn't go any further. Literally, none of them would further explain what they meant by something else. \n\nI called up the security once when it happened again, and two of them came up and couldn't smell anything since the smell went away moments before they arrived. Once I smelt it during the early evening, i quickly left my house and went and sniffed my neighbors house to track the smell to no avail. None of their house smells like that burning smell. \n\nI live in Malaysia, and i honestly do not know what's going on and what to do. I'm not sure if anyone had any similar experience or anything similar, but it'd be great to hear some. Yes, i'm freaking out. I do not need a mental breakdown now.",

        "text": "I don't want this to turn into a novel so I'll sum up the experiences that have led me to believe I have sensitivity to entities that exist in our world. I've always believed in ghosts, despite never experiencing anything. I loved reading stories and watching shows about the paranormal, but never dreamed I'd see anything real. \n\nA year and a half ago, I moved into an apartment I eventually realized was haunted. I can share all those stories in another post because there's way too much to explain here, but I looked for every rational explanation until the impossible happened. \n\nI believe my apartment is home to a friendly spirit who just wants attention and liked me. Then at the beginning of 2022, I believe something dark attached itself to me/the apartment when I went through a very bad time in my life. \n\nActivity ramped up and became more powerful until I brought a cross necklace from home and hung it in my room. Then the haunting went back to the previous, normal level of attention seeking. \n\nSince then, I started to reevaluate my views on spirits and the paranormal. I also thought back through my life and my families lives. I now believe I have an increased sensitivity to the paranormal, which draws them to me. \n\nI've never made active attempts to contact spirits, but several unexplained childhood memories make a lot more sense in this light. My dad has had paranormal experiences throughout his life along with his sister and her two daughters. My brother has actually seen entities and they've tried to communicate with him, though he shuts it out. \n\nI think this sensitivity runs in my family, and now that I'm aware of it, I wanted to know if it's possible to increase my sensitivity to them. From my interpretation, I am more sensitive to the passive spirits that exist in our world. The ones that are just moving around in our lives. \n\nThis then has the potential to draw in the more powerful spirits, most of which are harmless but actively try to be noticed. I think becoming more sensitive might just happen from mentally being more open to experiencing things, but I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to sense more. \n\nAs scary as it's been at times, I'm fascinated by this world. And even without actively seeking out spirits in any way, I've managed to draw them to me for my entire life so I'm leaning towards the knowledge is power ideology for myself and want to be better prepared for what I'll encounter.\n\nI also seriously do love sharing my stories so if anyone wants to hear about the experiences that has led to me believing all of this, please comment below. I'm a really rational person who tried to explain things logically before deciding there was no explanation other than paranormal activity for a lot of my experiences. \n\nSeveral non believers have been convinced of the existence of ghosts after being in my apartment, and it's always fun when people don't believe me and then the ghost decides to back things up. \n\nAny advice here is appreciated!!",

So to answer this question I want to create a thread so everybody can post images of structures that they have seen in the dream realm, and see if we can build a rudimentary visual map of this mythical place. \n\n I'll start.

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened many years ago, I was maybe 10 years old, in a well-known park in the city where I still live. If I remember correctly, I and a group of friends from school went there for a walk together with some of our parents. The place has a river crossing it which goes into what I suppose are these large sewer tunnels where the river ends. sometimes it has water and sometimes it doesn't, I haven't been there for a long time but it seems to me that most of the time it's dry, as it was on that occasion, so me and a friend whom I'll call 'V' got away from the rest of the children and we went to walk along the river, among the stones, until we reached what would be the entrance of those great tunnels.\n\nThe next thing I remember V and I were talking about a door of light that was seen inside the tunnel on a side of it, I mean, on the wall of the tunnel was this thing that was like a shiny white door of light which had three outlines of red squares coming out of that light, if we moved these squares seemed to change position relative to each other, very strange, our eyes were confused.\n\nThe light from that door was brighter, it stood out, it was different from the sunlight in that place, it was a \"cleaner\" light. I don't remember if we had seen that door appear or if it was already there when we arrived, I only remember that we were talking about what it could be. As far as I remember, it didn't make any sound, it was just there. Caught our attention so we wanted to get closer, but I think something scared us a lot since the next thing I remember is that we were running away from the tunnel/door towards where the rest of our group of friends were, we arrived and we told them but I don't think they believed us since I don't remember that we went back to the tunnel.\n\nAnd unfortunately, I'm sorry, I honestly don't remember more than what I already said. Over the years we all take different life paths so unfortunately I no longer have contact with V so I don't know if he remembers.\n\nI don't know what we saw that day but it is one of the things I will never forget. That's all, it's not very crazy like other things here but it's my little contribution. Thank you for reading.",

I was busy playing Minecraft at the time and chatting with friends on Snapchat. I remember that I was recording myself doing a ridiculous tiktok dance to send it to one of my friends on Snap. And exactly at that moment, I heard a sort of applause ? Actually not an applause but more like 5 claps. I thought that my parents came back \"earlier\" than expected and that they've heard me singing in a very silly way and they applaused as a \"joke\". So I still remember yelling stuff like \"Oh you're back\", \"How was work?\" and else. No one answered obviously.  \nAt that moment when I realized that my parents are not home, I started to panic. For the record I do have a dog, but he's a lazy little piece of fur , and he was sleeping in the living room. I thought that he made something fall, but nothing would make that sound. When I ran to the living room he was actually still asleep. After that I don't remember lots, I just know that I've called my parents. And I showed the recording I did. Because you could hear the clapping. I am also sure that it's not someone in a house besides mine. There was only one person who used to live in the house on our right, and it was an old lady, who at that time was for sure asleep.   \nOne thing that really made me think that it was related to paranormal stuff, is the fact that my house was from the 1800's, and it's just in front of a military graveyard. 49.18905068501044, 6.03550686501528 these are the coordinates to the house ( I don't live there anymore so all good, On google you may just find my dad's business, MAM concept, at that address ). I give those coordinated to show that I'm not lying about what I've said so far.  \nI was hesitating to talk about it, but I realized that I want to know if I am just paranoid or it was actually some sort of paranormal experience. I do believe in ghosts and stuff like this but, not entirely. So yeah... I am not killing myself and torturing my mind with that, but an answer to that event would help me understand what happened.",

The previous place had a bit of a bad atmosphere to the point that I was unable to rest well the majority of time even though I don‚Äôt have sleep issues normally. I used to incense that apartment and say prayers for cleansing semi regularly.\n\nMy new place on the other hand is great. I‚Äôve been resting so well. Until a couple of nights ago. \n\nI don‚Äôt get a lot of sleep paralysis, but I do get it every few years. Usually it‚Äôs similar in that I dream that I‚Äôm in the bed and room I‚Äôm actually sleeping in and something is touching me. Its weird since it scares me but at the same time I don‚Äôt mind it that much. \n\nFirst time the figure was sort of patting me, like petting my hair kind of like shushing a child. What made that experience scary was that I couldn‚Äôt move and felt like a weird pressure which felt was controlled by the figure. Then I had a few more in that vein, including one where something/someone cuddled me (lol). I actually really like that one so I didn‚Äôt fight to wake up as I usually do.\n\nWell, a couple of nights ago I had sleep paralysis. I was in my bed and felt both of my arms being tugged. This felt different from previous experiences as it felt as 2 presences. Well in dream I started also pulling and fighting them back. I got pissed off and flipped them off (I swear to god) at which point they started to push me from one side of the bed to the other. I started to pray and I woke up still praying and still pissed off.\n\nThe night after I had a pretty bad nightmare. What made it weird was that it was really coherent story and events wise. My dreams don‚Äôt usually have consistent logic. Whilst the nightmare was ongoing I realised I was dreaming so once more I started praying and woke up. Somehow feels like the nightmare was sent cause I was so pissy lol\n\nNow I‚Äôm considering lighting up some incense. I am also curious for any insights from people who also get/got sleep paralysis\n\n(Idk if it matters much but by religion I‚Äôm Christian. I myself more so identify as agnostic though)",

In fact I caught the viewcount on a post asking about why I was seeing 666 so much, mind you, the views were raising pretty fast and I was not hawking it out, waiting to see 666. I feel like it has gotten worse since this year, as I saw it a few times offline. In fact I have screenshots of the instances of me seeing it in suspicious places if any of you guys are interested.\n\nI know this will probably be written off as my brain seeing patterns, but it has undeniably increased. If it was this bad in the past, I am pretty sure I would have taken note of it then. Plus, I did not even have this number on my mind until I saw it in that angel URL. Also, people will probably say that 616 is the true MOTB/NOTB, but I do not agree. In either case if all you have to say is it is in my head or that 666 is not the correct number, please feel free to keep that to yourself.\n\nSo, what is this indicative of?  Is God trying to warn me to be a better Christian? Is it the sign the Endtimes or something bad in general or personally will happen soon? Am I in Hell or a evil simulation/coma dream and it is getting rubbed in my face? Something else?",

        "text": "I stumbled across my telepathic ability by accident about twenty years ago. At the time I was in a toxic and rather abusive relationship. As a result, I resorted to spiritual practices including prayer and meditation which opened the door to the supernatural ream. My boyfriend was super possessive and controlling, a typical narcissist, which was the perfect storm for an empath/HSP. \n\n While we were never physical towards each other, the emotional turmoil in the relationship seemed to express itself in different ways. He often would wake up with three claw marks on his back a weird phenomenon that happened way before we met. They always appeared in areas he could not reach, so that argument is moot. And certainly I wasn't the one responsible. \n\n Anyway, on top of all this negative energy, I noticed an unnatural shift in his facial expressions and his pale skin color when we argued. That fear alone convinced me he was possessed at times. With my religious upbringing, all I knew was to pray and do lots of meditation. By lots of meditation I mean at least once a day because never a day went by when there was no tension and I'm the type not to go to sleep with a grudge. \n\nWell, one evening I couldn't sleep. He was passed out in bed fast asleep.  Finally I crawled in bed next to him watching him sleep so peacefully. He was lying in the fetal position hands cupped under the pillow, completely relaxed. He had been practicing some meditation with me to \"heal\" the relationship and apparently it was paying off. But the price wasn't what I expected. \n\nAs I lay there trying to declutter my brain and watching him sleep like a baby, somehow I must have inadvertently tapped in some force field. I half thought to myself, \"what if we could...?\"\n\nBefore I could even complete the thought, he opened his eyes which where all black and said in a deep low voice, \"Who sent you?\" And then closed his eyes and fell back to sleep as if nothing happened. A jolt of fear went through me and I shook him awake, yelling, trembling in shock. \"Who sent you?\" He was responding to a random thought surfacing in my mind \"What if we could talk together telepathically?\" \n\nMind you, I was staring at the space between his brow when the thought crossed my mind. So the timing seemed too much of a coincidence, especially for someone who had no history of talking in their sleep. \n\nOf course, he had no memory and was in disbelief. Talking in his sleep? Maybe so, I told myself to justify. The pitch black eyes? Imagined due to stress? Was I half asleep myself in dream state? Hallucination? As the biggest first skeptic myself, I tried years to rationalize what happened. \n\nNope, I wasn't asleep nor dosing off. My body was relaxed though and one could say I was daydreaming. But daydreaming could also open portals because they can put one in a deep trance. I think between the trance like state and having my eyes fixed on the chakra between his brow and forehead, I accidentally tapped in a force field. \n\nAs science and spiritualiy evolve these days, I have my own theories on what happened that night. I have done tons of research but get no closer to an answer, just more possibilities in a world full of mystery and the unexplained. Any thoughts?",

( I'm not a native English speaker so please be lenient to me)  \nOne day she decided to visit a place which is about 200 km far from our city. It's a salty  water lake which is very popular among tourists who come to visit our region's local sites. She went there with one of her colleagues who was driving, and they left our city in the morning, spent some time on the lake, and then headed out back home. It was about 5 pm, late September, sun started to  go down by the time. The road was empty, they rich the speed limit and kept it that way for a most of their distance.   \nThen suddenly they see a man nearby the side of the road. He didn't even try to hitch-hike, just stood there looking opposite of driving direction. His appearance was so unusual and stand-out that my friend kept it in her mind while though seeing it just for a few seconds. The man match all those typical \"beauty\" standards - if I'm able to say that. 6ft tall blue-eyed blonde guy with fancy hair dress and well-groomed beard, ideal posture and a white coat on top of that - which is unbelievable when it's dust and mud all over the place - and the place itself doesn't provide you any reason on earth for a party like that. It's a desert with almost no living creatures around, only small settlements within 15-20 miles reach maybe, I'm not sure, with farmers and their cattle. They kept on driving for 40 minutes more. Then they decided to make a pit-stop on a gas station, coffee, bathroom, just 5 minutes or so, they wanted to get back home as soon as possible. They were slightly away from the building when they saw the man again, he was exactly the same guy they met nearby the highway side almost an hour ago.  They were shocked - it looked like a  sophisticated prank, at least. But how and why? No reasonable answer occurred and they should've been reconcile the fact that it's somewhat very weird just happened to them a couple of minutes ago. They immediately started to freak out and get nervous  a lot, such a bummer way to finish a good travel. Anyway, sooner or later they got back home, and then after some days of reflection thinking, she decided to share the story with me, and now I'm here.  \nWhat are your thoughts of that, dear people? Maybe it's just a normal situation and there's nothing to worry about?",

Unfortunately there are usually a few missing person signs on it. One of them was a friend of mine. I had just seen her the other week. I began to fear the worst because I knew what she was into and the outcome wasn‚Äôt going to be promising. Needless to say it bugged me, I spoke to my brother and sister about it, but I was still worried about her. The next day I head back home, bout 90 minutes south, I decide to take a nap since I had to work in a few hours. I had a dream where I was sitting on the arm of a white couch. My arm was along the back of the couch. I was sitting next to my missing friend, she was using a laptop. In my dream I kind of jumped up and moved my arm. She looks over at me and says put it back. I shrugged my shoulders and put my arm back where it was. \nI wake up and head to the gas station, I go in and pay, then make my way back to my car. I see this guy and girl coming from my right and they are going to walk right in front of me. When the guy gets in front of me he looks at me and pretty aggressively says to me, That bitch is dead!\nAbout a week later I‚Äôm at the same store and my friend walks in. I call her over and put my arm around her(like the dream) and told her what happened. She did not believe me. She wanted to see the missing poster. Sigh. I was thinking dumb at first as if she wanted me to take down the poster from the bulletin board not realizing I could of taken a picture of it. Glad she is ok though.",

        "text": "So, bit of background, I (23, British) was viewing houses with my parents. I was 12/13 at the time. We viewed one house which I absolutely hated. It had an acre of garden, going into woods at the far  lower end. That wooded part, specifically one area of it, gave me the creeps. I noped out of there but of course, my parents loved the house and so I've been living here ever since.\n\nI slowly got over my fear of that area, that is, until recently. Now, people round here, especially the older folk who moved in when the houses were first built in the 70's, believe the woods to be haunted. From ghosts, to cryptids, you name it, some old hag claims it can be found there. I've had many strange experiences there, but for this story, I'm focusing on one in particular. It's not super interesting but here goes...\n\nAbout 6 months ago I was in the garden, at the edge of that wooded corner. Can't remember why I was there but I'd long gotten over my fear of that place and I didn't get spooked easy. I hear something deer-sized, just outside the property in the woods, coming towards the garden. I'm familiar with deer, so I find it odd that it's approaching me, as deer are notoriously shy. Then I realise, it's in the trees. Something massive is climbing through the trees towards me. Like I said, I'm not easily spooked, but I made a quick retreat back up to the house. Wish I could say I saw it, but no. \n\nThen, tonight: about 9:30pm I got an urge to go down to that corner. Don't ask why. I'm obsessive-compulsive so if my brain says check a place out, then I do. I felt uneasy. I felt watched as I went back to the house, like something tried to call me down there deliberately. I get back to the house and my mum asks if I heard it. She can't describe the sound but somehow I didn't hear it when I was there, or I just missed it. I go to my brothers window which faces the woods and I open it. Coming from that wooded corner is the most god awful crying I've ever heard. It sounds like a cat trying to impersonate a human. Sounds more human than cat. I've heard cats and vixens before but this is different. Now, being an animal lover, I have to investigate. But something tells me to bring my brother and my knife. Parents watch us from the house. I hear nothing, total silence, and I go back in and here I am writing this.\n\nI've had other strange experiences in those woods latley, like meeting a huge dog with no owner, and reading someone from the area's story about seeing a tall, humanoid creature in the woods, very close to my house, to name just a couple. But this is long enough so I won't go into detail.",

I bought first house a few weeks ago at this stage (it's a one story with an attic) and nothings really been \"strange\" persay but from a week of moving in, I started to hear what sounded like ticking in the top left corner of my room. It went on for a week before I went to check it out and I found what looked like a rat skull, so I called the exterminator and I thought that was the end of it. But a day later it returned, I know its not an animal because its always in the exact same spot every time.\nAnd then not even a week after the exterminator visit, I had some school friends over (and C from the previous story). We all went to sleep at around 12 and when I woke up my watch was gone and there was a scratch mark in its place. I have the pictures as proof too. For context, I always sleep with my watch on, the only time I take it off is when I shower and I had done that the night before so there was no need to take another one. Anyway, I was the first awake and the first person I showed was C and she immediately felt something was weird. We all just left the house and other things for the rest of the day until they went home. The weirder things is that I basically flipped my entire room looking for that watch, seeing if it had fallen behind my bed or something but no. It was gone and it still hasn't show up again yet, I suspect it'll be in the attic but I honestly don't want to go back up there.\nIf anyone knows what to do, help would be much appreciated since I've never had a spirit steal anything of mine.

        "text": "\nIt‚Äôs been years and i can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I was 26m and living in Amsterdam for a bit. I was with an old female friend . \n\nAt the time i was experienced with psychedelics, and she had never.\n\nWe ate a healthy amount of the truffles commercial available and headed for the park. We took our rest on a blanket deep in the park surrounded by lovely humans. It was pure euphoria and no visual effects. Sun sets and we decided to leave the park. As we we‚Äôre leaving i decided to take a smaller path to cut back and we end up in a small clearing in a group of trees. While in this clearing i noticed that the air changed. It felt electric to degree that was palpable, and little shining particles filled the air. Soon we noticed music seemingly floating in the air‚Ä¶ coming from all directions. It was ethereal, ambient, beautiful, and wistful. \n\nThis is where it began to turn. We became intent on finding the source of the music and left our path heading, what we thought, was back towards the interior of the park. We could not find speakers. The music was soft no matter the direction we turned, never louder, never softer. The park was largely empty at this point and it‚Äôs dark dark. We come to a structure that looked like a bunch of white tents with pointing tops. Under the tent there are many people. They are all beautiful, all dressed in the same monochromatic tones. All very elegant but casual at the same time. We walked through the crowd but not a single person even acknowledged our presence. Music still softly emanating, and dust particle like points of light still filling the night air. It was like we didn‚Äôt exist to them. We started to fall into our fear. As curiosity turned to fear, we decided we wanted to get away from whatever this was. \n\nWe want to get out of the park as quickly as possible, and try our hardest, but we cannot find our way out. As we move through the park the music and lights persist, and we encounter more of these people. I had spent many days in this park and the lack of people, even at night, was unnerving.  Any of the people we encountered shared the same characteristics. All beautiful, sad, and apathetic. There were groups of them riding bikes, and all of the bikes were the same vintage and color. It all seemed like it was from a distant past. \n\nThen it starts to shift. The electric feeling grew, and the lights became more pronounced. I looked up into the sky and saw that a spiral galaxy was in but not filling the sky with perpendicular orientation to the horizon. Gravity seemed to fluctuate with location, to the point that it seemed to effect the trees and plants. There was a large boom/ crashing noise and increased light. Turning to look towards the noise there it was. Maybe 20‚Äô from us, there was a huge branch maybe 1‚Äô thick at its thickest on the ground. It looked as if it had been exploded by lightning and was in maybe 5 or so segments. The segments glowed around the edges like embers, but not as red in tone. It didn‚Äôt seem right because all the pieces were oriented so that the branch looked normal, save a few inches between the segments. Like, what could have done that without scattering the pieces? Over the branch there is a figure standing. Different than any person or thing we had encountered up till then. It seemed male, it was brightly colored and seemed 50% clown and 50% Venetian carnival. It‚Äôs presence was both dark and mocking. It seemed to be in control. It did not want us to go anywhere near it, or the branch. Not terrifying, but deeply unsettling. We ran. My friend started to fall into terror. Eventually we find a park exit. A small iron arch connected to the fence. As we pass through the gate, there is an intense sensation that feels like we are moving through jello. Then it‚Äôs over. The music is gone, the lights gone. We are not sober, but it was like going from 100 to 20 in an instant, something I‚Äôve never experienced with truffles. \n\nWe went back to our place and just sat there in disbelief. My friend did not want to talk about it. She was terrified. The next day we went back over the events and our recollections matched. To this day if I say the word ‚ÄòAmsterdam‚Äô her color changes and she  says ‚Äòplease no, i don‚Äôt want to talk about it.‚Äô\n\nI have carried this with me, and have told a few people that seemed like they wouldn‚Äôt judge me. I have been back to the park many times, and even tried to recreate the experience with no luck. I am desperate to talk with anyone whom this is hauntingly familiar. Please let there be someone!",

        "text": "So here's a strange one. IDK if it even belongs here so I will understand if it gets deleted. I am 19 years old. I'm driving my car on the freeway and my friend Gabe is riding shotgun. I'm trying to get back to Gabe's house which is an hour away so I'm going as fast as my beat up old ride will go. I'm in the fast lane and coming up on this truck. It's a 1970's model pick up truck with a bunch of road signs in the back. It's only going about 45 MPH in the fast lane and the speed limit is 65. As I am coming up on this truck I can read all of the signs in the back. All of them are legitimate road signs and the letters look official, but they are not state produced road signs. All of them mentioned Satan and Route 666 in some way. I remember one of them in particular. \"Las Vegas, Route 666, and Satan\" all being in the same sign. IDK how Las Vegas was associated with this craziness, but it's going to get even weirder here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI move one lane over to the left and pass this guy. I look to my right as I pass him and the guy is really sketchy looking. He's a white guy with long brown hair. a cut off sleeve button up blue shirt and he's got the craziest look in his eyes and grin on his face as he looks at me and my friend. I think he was on acid. I've been around a lot of people on LSD in my younger days and they all get this wicked grin on their face. If you don't know what I'm talking a bout, Google Richard D James Album by Aphex Twin. That album cover is the kind of look this guy had on his face. My friend and i are laughing back and forth with each other. We can't believe what we just saw. It was definitely a \"WTF!\" moment. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've held on to this memory for years. You don't see that every day is a bit of an understatement. But here's where it gets weird and into false memory territory. I live in the USA. So if you caught on already; I said that I was driving in the fast lane and when I passed this guy I moved over one lave to the left. That's exactly how I remember it, and never questioned this memory in any way until about 2 years ago when what is plain as day finally smacked me in the face. We drive on the right side of the road. If I'm in the fast lane, I can't pass this guy by moving over to the left. As I thought about it, I remembered that everyone was driving on the left and on the other side of the dividing wall (where we should have been) all of the other cars were going the opposite direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a very vivid and detailed memory for me. But obviously it's a false memory. How much of it is false, I can't say. I lost touch with my friend Gabe so I can't get a hold of him and ask him how he remembers this, or even if he remembers this. This memory that I have held on to for a few decades is real on some level. Gabe and I talked about it a few times afterwards. For the next few days we told friends and family about it and it would come up in conversation once in a while at social gatherings. So it did happen. But how much of it happened I can't say. I know in crystal clear detail that I looked outside of the passenger window at this guy and he was hanging his left arm outside of his driver window as he looked at me. The dividing wall of the freeway was on his right and as I passed him and moved one lane over to the right so I could get back into the fast lane. As clearly as I can remember that, there is absolutely no way that this is possible.",

I didn‚Äôt really think too much of it, I‚Äôve had paranormal stuff happen to me in past houses and if this was the extent of it I‚Äôd be fine.\n\nOver the next couple months I‚Äôd be finding myself waking up frequently at 3:00-3:30am, and in one of these bouts of ‚Äúrandom‚Äù insomnia I was picking up things around my closet and saw the sliding door on it open from a nearly closed position. I feel the hair on my skin stand up, and overwhelming sense of presence as this is right in front of my face.\n\nAll of this stuff stopped (besides the random 3:00 wake up) until an hour ago at 3:00am I wake up to something quickly touching my left foot until I move it back instantly. I get up and then almost immediately feel that same skin crawl and giant presence, and have the overwhelming sense to just leave. Currently at my Meijers parking lot lol.\n\nI know this isn‚Äôt that crazy, I‚Äôm not overly concerned about it, but I figure it‚Äôs worth getting some second opinion on the situation.

        "text": "My grandfather, Ray, died earlier this year in March. He was the man from whom I got my sense of humor, appreciation for puzzles, and love of all people. He was a beautiful soul who made everyone around him feel loved and unequivocally made the world a better place. He was surrounded by love in his final days and his funeral was a wonderful expression of love in this life and the next. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've never experienced anything paranormal before. I've always been curious and welcomed experiences but never seen or heard or felt anything myself. I might have been a bit disappointed by this fact. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday was the day after my girlfriend and I celebrated our fifth dating anniversary. At Thanksgiving dinner, we had a significant portion of my family, including my grandmother, my mother and father, and my sister who somehow managed to get away from Air Force tech school to join us. We also had my girlfriend's mother and sister with us. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was the perfect moment. My grandmother offered a ring with which to propose, I set up a toast, and I popped the question. She said yes. The woman I love is now to become the woman I will love forever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout two minutes after I got down on one knee and asked the question, I heard a deep, warm, loving laugh coming from my grandfather's favorite chair. It was familiar. It was full of love. I felt it more than I heard it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at my cousin immediately. She asked if I heard it. I said I did. Her daughter said she did. My now fianc√© said she did, but she thought it was me initially.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is one of the most powerful experiences of my life. My grandfather was there to witness and bless our engagement, as he should have been. I've never felt love like I did today, and I can't stop crying about it. My grandpa helped make me into the man I am today, and I cannot wait to take him into my future with the family I am about to start myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe went to visit his grave site after dinner, as was planned before today, but I knew he had already visited us. He was a great man, and I don't have to miss him anymore because he's always with me.",

        "text": "(English is not my first language sorry for the mistakes.\"\n\nSo to give some background information, I'm spiritual, if you don't know what that is  Spirituality involves the recognition of a feeling or sense or belief that there is something greater than myself, something more to being human than the sensory experience I believe in souls, spirit guides and reincarnation, etc. \n\nMy friend is a medium and can connect with spirit guides and also ghosts/souls. My friend and I were hanging out at her place, we had the house to ourselves and decided to do a session.  She was doing a session on me and I asked normal questions like \"What's my future like\" and so on.  Until I asked a question about one of my friends, this friend of mine has some trouble, and has been battling depression, anxiety, and some other things. I asked if we could try and connect with her spirit guides and ask what was happening to her, we tried that... bad idea.\n\nMy friend who was doing the session had her eyes closed and was holding my hand, her face started to twitch in an uncomfy way, but I didn't want to disturb her so I said nothing. Suddenly the room we were in had this weird vibe, an unwelcoming vibe just a very unpleasant vibe. \n\nShe suddenly stood up from the couch we were sitting on, she went to grab some incense lights, and started saying \"you're not welcome here, get out of my house!\"I've never experienced anything like this as I was new to all of this at the time.\n\nSuddenly this terrible feeling came rushing to me, I don't know how to describe it, I think anyone that met a ghost/soul knows what I'm talking about. The best way I can put it is trapped, I felt trapped. no matter where I went in the room I felt trapped and small like I was someone's prey like I was being watched. \n\nThankfully my friend got this ghost/soul out of the house and we sat down to talk about what just happened. My friend told me this is what is called a \"clinging spirit.\" It's a spirit that feeds on negativity and sadness or in my friend's case her depression and anxiety.\n\nMy friend told me what she saw afterward, to understand this you need to understand the floor plan. So right as you enter the house there's a staircase that goes upstairs, and on the right is the kitchen and on the left is the living room. (Where we were) Neither of these rooms has doors it's just the wall with a hole in it. The living room couch is at the opposite end of the entryway so you have a full view from there. \n\nMy friend said in the doorway she saw this tall and skinny black goo, it had no face but it had the shape of a woman's body, the moment it appeared in the doorway it started screaming at my friend like a very loud painful screaming, a horror movie scream. The moment she opened her eyes the ghost wasn't there but the feeling of its presence was, that's also what I felt.\n\nAfter all, this happened we called my friend's mom and sister and we slept in the guest room, as we were to afraid to go upstairs to my friend's bedroom. (We were 15 when this happened)\n\nI just wanted to share this as I'm new to Reddit so thought this was a good start to welcome myself here. :)",

        "text": "So pretty much as described in the title. From a young age I‚Äôve always suspected a ‚Äúpresence‚Äù around the house. Never really thought much of it and my mum always dismissed me as paranoid. - These days she agrees with me that something is definitely going on. \n\nWith that being said, both my mum and sister have encountered the same ghost. My mum tells a story of a man in a top hat that stood by her bedside, bowed his head to her then swooshed away into the mirror. My sister years later told a similar story about a man in a top hat watching her in our old room. They‚Äôd never discussed this before so it was a big shock once they both told their stories as I‚Äôm pretty sure it was the same ghost. \n\nMy sister also had a friend with a ‚Äúgift‚Äù as she described it and supposedly saw two kids hiding in our built in shared bedroom wardrobe. None of us thought much of this until my mums friend came by and described seeing the exact same thing. Down to the details she described the same thing, a boy and a girl hiding in our wardrobe. Weird right ? \n\nI, on the other hand, never had such experiences apart from weird things happening TO me. When I was younger I used to constantly hear music coming from beneath the floors which is odd as we are the basement flat and the floor is solid concrete underneath the floorboards. Or I‚Äôd constantly find myself falling down stairs after feeling as if I‚Äôd be pushed but was dismissed and labelled as a klutz.\n\n I also had this weird sense that I was being watched all the time, like seriously I used to make my parents escort me to the toilet and make them sit outside because I had this eery feeling that something was watching me and because of all my ‚Äúclumsy‚Äù accidents I didn‚Äôt feel safe. As well as this my stuff would always go missing ! It was weird and for years I felt like a scatterbrains because no matter where I left things, they would never be there? \n\nFor years I‚Äôve been experiencing this, whether it be my phone, my keys, a trinket or a toy. It would disappear and reappear in the most odd places where I know I definitely did not leave it. \n\nWell now it‚Äôs started happening to my mum and she finally believes me! My sisters (finally) moved out so it‚Äôs just the two of us and her stuff has somehow grown legs and wondered off too. Very very weird. \n\nAnyone experienced a similar thing ?",

        "text": "I live in Melbourne, Australia and there used to be a mental asylum called Larundel built in 1938 but eventually closed down in 1999. \nI was told about this place and how haunted it was with people hearing creepy things. I was keen to check it out. More than 10 years later, I still can‚Äôt explain what happened in those 3 or so minutes we were there. \n\nI‚Äôm a Long time reader. First time poster. \nThis isn‚Äôt the scariest story just one of those moments that you can‚Äôt explain that leave you feeling unsettled. \n\nIt was 2011. One night we drummed up this stupid idea cause we were bored and had nothing to do. So me and three mates decided to go check out larundel because, why not lol.\n\nThe asylum at the time we went was being prepared to be demolished/renovated for new apartments. So most of the entrances and windows were boarded up with wood. The building we parked next to was surrounded by a metal make shift fence to keep people or squatters out and had a security patrolling the grounds. \n\nOne of my friends was strong enough to lift the metal fence that wasn‚Äôt properly attached which allowed us to crawl under and get inside the property grounds. It was all fun and games we were having a good time, the feeling of doing something you‚Äôre not allowed to and trying not to get caught, you know the feeling. \n\nWe were constantly on the lookout out for the security officer patrolling but also trying to look for a doorway inside. When we finally found one, we one by one walked inside. Scared shitless, mind you, we all put our torches on our phones on and shined the light inside. When you walk in the door it‚Äôs a small entrance area that leads into a main room. We walked a little closer to the main room to get a better look. There were no windows that we could see, just a simple room. Mind you this all happened in 30 sec so we didn‚Äôt get a proper look. In front of us on our left was a stair case I think leading up and all the walls were covered in graffiti. We didn‚Äôt see anything paranormal. It was scary enough just being there. It had only been 10-15 seconds of us standing there when we suddenly heard footsteps approaching. \n\nThe crunching sound of the gravel grew closer and closer from behind us outside. We immediately shut off our torches and were left standing there huddled together in the darkness, we couldn‚Äôt see shit! I might as well have had my eyes closed. But they were wide open expecting something to grab me. We had our backs to the door behind us waiting for the footsteps to hopefully walk by us thinking the security guard must‚Äôve seen us. As the crunching of the gravel was fast approaching us, we all instinctively held each others hand waiting for the security to bust us. \n\nWe stopped breathing, as the footsteps came to a halt behind us. The sound was unmistakable. The crunching of the gravel stopped. We just stood there. The silence was deafening. The darkness swallowing us. Neither of us turning around. It felt like eternity but we stood there for about 10 seconds waiting for something ANYTHING! A sound or someone to say something behind us or a torch to shine in on us from outside. But nothing. \n\nIt wasnt Until one of my friends turned around slowly and there was no one there. He finally broke the silence and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get the fuck outta here‚Äù And we bolted out the door and back to our car. Neither of us saw the security as we raced out the door. We got in the car and left and never went back. \n\nStill 10 + years later I think about those footsteps and how no one was there when we turned around. We never heard the footsteps receding as we stood there in the silent darkness. Even if it was a weird prank and someone was there, we would‚Äôve heard the footsteps running away. It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. It just stopped directly behind us. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôll never be able to explain. Unless it is explainable and I‚Äôm just being dramatic. \n\nWe all remember it exactly the same way. I wrestled with the memory for a while thinking I was misremembering but after checking with my mates again after so long, we all heard those footsteps behind us, there‚Äôs no doubt about it. \n\nChalking it down to scary unexplained moments that could‚Äôve gone differently if we stayed to investigate, but the whole experience was eerie and unsettling from the moment we shut our torches off and were left standing there in complete darkness.",

        "text": "so a little Under a month ago I was given a oujia board by a friend. 2 other people and myself set up the room for it and got ready to  start, we weren‚Äôt expecting much as the friend who had given it to me said in the many times he had tried it only once or twice had it moved and even then he believed it to be one of their friends subconsciously moving it. \nWe began the session and followed all of the rules. We asked introduction questions for abt 20 minutes with no response. One of the main rules is to not ask for physical signs, ofc. My friend had asked if there was anyway we could know anyone was with us and my cat who had been laying near by starting looking around as if someone was running circles around the room and then stopped. We tried to ask a few more questions with no response. We finished the session and went abt our nights. \nHere is where I am troubled. An hour after everyone had left me and my partner were laying in bed as he had just gotten home from work and I was telling him we had attempted and our lights suddenly turned on by themselves, my lights are operated by a controller on a wall not a switch ( I‚Äôll insert a picture if possible) he was spooked more than I was and we decided to simply ignore it as a malfunction. A week or so later a neighbor came by and mentioned how bad luck and stuff it is how, once she left we were discussing how she was simply being so negative and rude and as we said the words the lights turned on and off twice in a row flickering this time. I grabbed the controller off the wall and turned them off. After that it has been calm until this morning. I finally gave the board back last night, and as we were laying in bed this morning me and my partner were simply talking abt life and being grateful for eachother and what we have the lights turned on once again.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/z3sdx5/what_is_a_ghost/",
        "text": "Read slowly and thoughtfully. Enjoy.\n\nWe humans have always been aware of the other side. The unknown. What dwells in the darkness. It exerts a powerful pull on us. Most of us try to turn away from its uncomfortable form, some of us try to put words and descriptions to it in an effort to make the unknown known. Even fewer embrace it, as they realize it will always be part of us. The fear is the strongest when the threat is sensed to be close enough to be dangerous, but not tangible enough to fully understand. When you have to look over your shoulder just to make sure *it* is not there. This fear lives in us when we walk in a dark forest, but also among people. Perhaps the intentions of our fellow humans are the most unnerving of all, the mask people wear to conceal what they really think of you. What they really intend to do *to* you. Put these together, the external and the internal, and you create a ghost. An apparition. The oldest fear of mankind. The horror of where it came from, what it intends to do to you, but most of all; that you know it was once just like you, and that you can become just like *it*. It represents eternity and restlessness. It is hollow and alone. Forever. Have you ever wondered what it‚Äôs like being a ghost?  \n\n  \n**A Study of Spirits**    \n   Death of a human being releases us. When our existence ends we lose the ability to form new memories, to move and to act. However the memories we formed are not as part of our brain, not really, the mind transcends the brain and its physical existance. Some call this the soul. This focused collection of memories and thoughts form the 'I' we feel every day, and since it was formed in the human brain this is how it sees the world. It needs the body to continue to act as itself. It needs to be bound by something that keeps it focused, or else be dissolved into the void. No one knows what really happens after death, if our existence as an 'I' lives on somewhere, in some other place.      \n   When death occurs the memories of the mind do not *want* to leave. This existence is all that they know, and everything they remember. Just as they did before death, they try to cling onto that which grounds them in the universe. As all things, they wish to continue existing. However, without a focus the pull of the void is often powerful enough to break them apart from the physical plane, and with the self dissolved or transferred, they scatter and disappear.    \n   So what is a ghost? The soul is sometimes powerful enough, or persistent enough, to not let go. The soul can attach itself to something other than the body of its' living self, using its memories as tendrils, as chains to not let go. Sometimes this thing is another human being, sometimes it is a building or even stranger things still. In all cases it is something the memories can latch onto, something that feeds them with recognition and familiarity.    \n     \n   For the spirit, it exists in a confused state between places. Between the physical plane and other planes of existence, or non-existence. Time does not flow in the same way for it as it used to. Time does not lead to inevitable change for the spirit, as it does for human beings. The spirit is instead defined by the memories it still retains of its living self, and often the most powerful ones that remain. In the case of a spirit almost all of these are powerful emotional moments, such as traumas. Other memories may still linger, but many have faded away, leaving a confused and distorted being left with only parts of itself. It has a deep feeling of something being wrong, but unable to understand what. The more memories that fall away like autumn leaves, the less rational the ghost becomes. The more focused it becomes on reliving the few memories it still retains.    \n   When the ghost is inactive or dormant it exists in a kind of sleeping state, and temporarily dissolved into the dark void without a focus. It is less aware of itself then, since without a focus it loses its sense of being. When something activates a memory or pulls it back close to the physical plane it is like waking from a deep slumber, often without the sense of where or how it ended up where it is. The waking ghost can be angry, sad or confused. Since the soul cannot easily form new memories, every experience like this is equally confusing or traumatic. It only has its old memories to guide it, very rarely forming new ones. In its wakeful state it is wise to treat it with great care, and avoid it completely if given the chance.    \n   A ghost is bound to the physical plane, and prevented from passing on by memories of its traumatic past. These are the chains that keep it grounded in the environment where they were caused, and is what pulls the ghost back in again and again. These 'chains' of memories are also the easiest path for the ghost to interact with the physical plane and what causes the ghost to relive and repeat these horrible events over and over again. Just like it is bound to physical reality by these chains they are also its vessel of manipulating it. The more emotional it becomes, the more powerful it becomes, but simultaneously loses control over itself. Finally it can become enraged, uncontrollable, lashing out at everything around it to get rid of the pain and confusion it feels, without understanding why.    \n  \n   Emotion in nearby living beings feed this power, fearful humans near the ghost make it grow stronger, bolder, more powerful but also more unstable. More unreliable. More disturbed.      \n   Since the spirit no longer has a body, or a brain, it is not able to act like it once did. However, as it was formed as a human it still sees itself in the shape of a human. The shadow of a human being. To others, the spirit looks like its old remembered self. This is the 'veil of self', the facade that memories drape the soul in to keep it calm and focused, to prevent itself from panicking. This causes the outward appearance of the ghost to resemble its image of itself, although distorted by all the memories and parts of its personality that have dissolved since then.    \n   A common exception to this is that hiding the cause of death is very difficult. The memory of death is deeply seared into its subconscious. Any visible scarring or wounds attributed to its death will show through this facade. The *real* external self of the spirit is always its old body. The soul is still tied to its old body, after all it is very hard for it to let go. When the spirit is seen through a mirror or reflection, or sometimes when it is observed without being aware of others, or itself, this shows through. It then appears as an image of its dead body, or perhaps closer to it, such as the corpse during the final hours, as seen by its loved ones.      \n   This is also an effect of the spirit losing control of itself. When enraged or disturbed, the 'veil of self' breaks and it can appear as its corpse or skeleton to others and to itself. This is not only traumatizing to the victim but can also be so for the spirit, as it still seems to believe in some ways that it is alive. After all that is what most its memories tell it to believe. If one can make a spirit realize that it is indeed dead, that may lead to some hope in breaking the chains that bind it. This is a risky endeavor however, as failure means getting caught up in its vengeful denial of the truth, often with a horrible outcome for the living.    \n     \n   The keys to understanding the spirit are always in its past. Whether one wants to is another question entirely, as these events evidently created enough horror to still echo through time and space. The reader should be aware of the very real dangers it means to tread in the darkness of the human soul. These memories are simultaneously its strength and its weakness, and expressions of its will leave traces behind, breadcrumbs that can sometimes be followed to their source. The closer one gets to the truth, the more power the spirit will come to hold over them.  A spirit is in a sense imprisoned in its own decaying mind, continually living the same experience and unable for the most part to realize it. It is often not in full control of its senses, and while intending to communicate it can often lash out in frustration, causing real harm to the living. While this harm can be physical, it is more often emotional. This, coupled with the fact that the ones easiest affected are the ones who themselves carry trauma or experiences similar to the spirit can lead to irrational or self-harming behaviour in us humans.    \n   For those so inclined, observing the repetition of its ways holds the possibility of slowly understanding the spirit. This, combined with any information that can be gleaned from historial records may help in building the full picture of its suffering. The reader should beware that doing so inevitably leads to enforcing its haunting, and comes with increasing instability and danger. The risk therein is to overestimate ones ability to stand unaffected. The human mind is fragile, and our most powerful mental shield is ignorance.    \n   Just like human beings, all spirits are unique. There is no single way to treat them. They may feel heartbroken, misunderstood, betrayed, vengeful or purely sadistic. Note that I do not use the word *evil*, as just like with us humans things are never that easy. However, the nature of the spirit will determine how to approach it in the least unsafe manner.      \n   As my closing words on this topic, dear reader, if you ever encounter a being such as this: Do not let curiosity get the better of you. Some things are not meant to be disturbed.  \n\n  \n   *Archibald G. Kardec*  *Magistrate of the Study of the Supernatural, 1878*",

        "text": "About two weeks ago, my husband and I were in the kitchen washing dishes. We heard knocking on the front door. More than just knocking. It was bam, bam, bam. About 15 times. We got upset because who would beat on our door like this? Our house is small so we were close to the door. No one could leave without us seeing them. There was no one there. No one on the security system. Just no one. I got a phone call the day after this with the news that a relative I‚Äôm close to has cancer. He looks perfectly healthy, goes to the doctor for regular checkups, no signs or symptoms.   Usually when something bad has happened or will happen, these knocks occur.  The last time, I remember was the night before I had a car accident and almost died.",

That dream turned into my nightmare and I wake up screaming, have anyone had any similar experiences like this?",

        "text": "\"In the morning after my birthday last sundayI was asleep. On and off again over the night upon the hours until it struck three when I was in a dream. I awoken to a tap or more so a smack on my window. I opened my eyes and I saw darkness. But my vision was clear and adjusted I could see the whiteness of my closet door. In the darkness we‚Äôre ink like splotches and one of them was the silhouette of a human that crawled from my closed window, over me and my bed to stand at the foot. It moved like an inky shadow to my side and put it‚Äôs knee on my bed next to my own. And I felt it‚Äôs weight and my mattress shift accordingly. Scared I moved my hand to my light switch and turned on my nightstand lamp. I saw the figured vanish. But not entirely. An outline of sorts remained. Like the shadow of a shadow and I saw it leap back in shock as the light came on. Then that too disappeared. And I felt the weight on me gone. \"\n\nThis isn't the first time I had encounters of something in my sleep or at night. Over the years on rare occasions something like this happens. I can count about to our occasions over the course of my 25 years. I always shot it up to just my mind playing tricks on me and my eyes adjusting to the darkness of night. But what I can't explain is the physical feelings of something touching me or affecting the area around me.",

        "text": "This happened in 2018. \n\nOne night, my cousin and I decided we were gonna take a drive and park off in a dark area to hotbox her car. We were parked off in an area next to the Mission House in Grand Cayman which was built in the 1700s.\n\nWe were smoking and talking as time went by when one of the motion sensor lights turned on a few yards away from her car. We both stopped talking, looked at the light but continued our conversation because the first thing that came to our minds were \"Maybe a cat walked by or another animal\"\n\nWe talked for another 5 minutes before I realized I caught myself constantly looking around. I was also overcame with a feeling of dread and fear and thought, maybe I'm paranoid because I'm high and I didn't want to scare her either so I said \"Let's leave\" \n\nOn the drive back home, I mentioned to her that I was actually really scared and she admitted she was terrified as well so we ended up laughing about it.\n\nAfter she dropped me home, that is when it started. \n\nI typically smoke in my bathroom so I decided to finish a half spliff that I had when I heard a noise in the kitchen like a cabinet shut. I was home alone..\n\nI brushed it off and the noises in the kitchen kept getting louder and I started to become scared again. \n\nMind you, this is not my first encounter with the paranormal. I was taught to not be afraid or acknowledge them and I am human so I do get started at times but I have never been overcome with fear and anxiety like I did. \n\nThat night, I ended up getting a scratch in the middle of my chest that was shaped like a cross (I took photos of the scratch progressing on my snapchat.)\n\n I ended up forcing myself to sleep and when I woke up the next day, the scratch was gone. \n\nI've had many paranormal experiences since sober or high but have never felt the type of fear I felt that night. Perhaps, what I encountered was not a ghost but a demon.",

        "text": "This happened to me(17F) when I was around 14,  most of my friends were not allowed to play after 9p.m. and so their mothers used to call them home at around 9p.m. Me and one of my friends lets call her A, our parents were very lenient. As in, they didn't use to call us even if it was past 10, expecting us to come home whenever we felt like. (fyi I live in an apartment which is in a pretty safe locality so its fine I guess.)\n\nMy house has a long window which is also visible from the park we used to play in. So if someone looks through the window, we are also able to see(from the park) the whole body of the person who's looking out of the window. I also want to point out that both of my parents are alcoholics and they usually just pass out drinking at night and leave the door unlocked of me to come inside. \n\nNow I usually come back home at around 9-9:30 since most of my friends go home, but that night my friend A and I were having a very interesting conversation and none of us wanted to go home, so we just continued to talk and it was around 10:40 now when she pointed at my house's window and said, \"I think your mother is watching us.\" there was no light in the room so we could only see a silhouette of a woman. I looked at the time and realized that it was very late so I yelled, \"I'm coming in 15 mins.\" so that she could hear me and go to sleep. But she did not.\n\nI yelled several times to her but I saw no movement so I assumed that my voice was not reaching her. So I told A that I might have to go and my mother was probably mad at me. So we separated our ways, I reached my house, I opened the door, I saw that all the lights of the house were off. I went to my parents' bedroom and I saw them. They were lying unconscious from alcohol. \n\nI did not sleep that night. The next day I told my mother about this and she brushed it off saying that she must have woken up to pee and stopped by the window to check on me, and after that we never talked about it. but I do think about this from time to time.",
