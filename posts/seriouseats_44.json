        "text": "I bought a fresh turkey for our Thanksgiving dinner this weekend, and I wanted to try Kenji's [spatchcocked](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/11/butterfiled-roast-turkey-with-gravy-recipe.html) version, instead of the traditional method I've used in the years past.  Furthermore, I want to try a [dry-brine](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/quick-and-dirty-guide-to-brining-turkey-chicken-thanksgiving.html) method, instead of the wet-brine that I've used a couple times already.  Don't get me wrong, my family told me that the wet-brined turkey was the best they've ever had.  But they're used to traditional, dry-as-chalk white meat, and tough-as-nails dark meat.  Plus, wet brining was a giant pain in the butt.\n\nThing is, I'm not clear on if I spatchcock before or after brining; couldn't find anything in the comments section.  It makes sense to spatchcock right before putting it into the oven, but I didn't know if it makes a difference either way.  Can anybody help me? ",

I cooked a Nongshim Gourmet Spicy bowl in the microwave, strained the broth into my immersion blender cup, added a clove of roasted garlic (actually pressure cooked garlic), and blended away. The broth had an appearance and mouthfeel that was very reminiscent of the creaminess of tonkotsu broth, and the garlic flavor was subtle. It was delicious and easy!",

Slide/Rotate the spoon out of the way leaving the egg behind. \n\nI find that this gets more of the white and yolk evenly submerged without a need for adjustments (as seen at 2:51 in the video).\n\nAlso recommend trying shakshuka with Kenji's juevos rancheros sauce as a base.

They were still liquid after 15 minutes, so I dumped them in a pan and just cooked them normally.  I cobbled together the timing and temperature from what I could find on the Internet, but there's not much and what recipes do exist vary wildly - some call for 200 F or lower for 2-3 minutes, some 250 for an hour.  \n\nAnybody have a recipe that works or an understanding of time/temperature/steam function for eggs?  I can find info on soft/hard/in shell boiling, but nothing concrete on what I want.   ",

My butcher is happy to age it for me so I'm just trying to decide how many days to age it for.\n\nI'm a fan of the funkiness that comes with longer aging but there will be kids at the meal. And although they are quite adventurous with food and have decent palates for little ankle biters, I don't want to push them too far.\n\nDo you think 60 days is too much? I only have ~45 day aged ribeye steaks as a benchmark (which they were fine with). Is there going to be a significantly different flavour profile with a 60 day roast vs a 45 day steak?\n\nThanks for any advice\n\nedit: I've read this http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/12/step-by-step-food-lab-reverse-sear-prime-rib.html and will certainly be using the Reverse Sear Method",

I've always wanted to try harissa, so I'm pretty excited, but everything I find online looks like more of a paste than a sauce that might be used to garnish a dish. Maybe I'm ignorant never having been to NYC or tried the real deal, but am I looking at the wrong thing? If so, and I can't find this harissa-style hot sauce, any reasonable substitutions? I have sambal oelek, sriracha, some Hungarian pepper sauce, etc. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: Harissa seemed locally unavailable, and I didn't feel like going to more than 3 stores today, so just went for sambal oelek. Might not be authentic to the real halal carts in NYC, but seeing that I've never actually had that, there was no nostalgia to be ruined. Thanks everyone for your thoughts.  Also, /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt , this recipe was awesome and great comfort food after a long day at work. Thanks!",

I've pan seared tofu a few times in the past with my cast iron, but have never had truly amazing results. Can get a good crisp, but it's still usually rather bland and poorly textured. To my surprise, the tofu I got at the restaurant was incredibly soft and tender on the inside while having a serious crunch to the outside (not deep fried). I've never used silken before, but I wonder if it was.\n\nhttp://www.seriouseats.com/2014/02/vegan-experience-crispy-tofu-worth-eating-recipe.html\n\nSo I saw Kenji's article. Unfortunately, he doesn't get too much into detail other than making sure you dry out your tofu and cook until brown. I notice he recommends extra firm cottony tofu. I feel like every time I try this, it ends up a bit dry and spongy on the inside. Am I possibly cooking it wrong, or might it be worth trying with a silken variety to get the biggest textural difference between tender and crunchy?\n\nHe also mentions not to season prior to cooking. Would one simply top with some fresh spice mix afterwards? I plan on using a sauce, but not coating it. ",

Advice?\n\nAlso, has anyone frozen the biscuits before baking them? With only two of us, it would be convenient.",

I thought it was good, until it proved too soft to work with.\n\nAnybody have any ideas? It's mainly for three fruit tarts this weekend, using different fruits to present at a party. ",

I know I can make the same amount of chili paste and freeze half but do you think I can replicate the rest of the recipe by simply dividing by 2?",
