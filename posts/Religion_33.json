Younger Evangelicals do not seem to like Israel and thanks to the Internet they understand that Jewish people do not like Evangelicals either. They are less likely to ponder to Jewish people and Zionism, yet they are not antisemitic.\n - Christians older than boomers are often not Zionists.\n - Traditional denominations of Christians, such as Catholics, Orthodox, Anglican, Mainstream protestant, etc. are not Zionists.\n - Most Evangelical Canadians and Evangelical Europeans are not Zionists, or at least not as much as American Evangelicals.\n - Boomers are very vocal at Evangelical Churches, so it seems Evangelicals are more pro-Zionist than they really are.\n - Republican politicians have enhanced the Judeo-philic attitude of some Evangelical Christians and made it greater than it is. They use it just as an excuse to send more American taxpayer money to Israel.\n\nOverall, I'd say most Christians are neutral or negative about Israel, but not anti-Semitic.\n\nIt seems Zionism in is only found in American Evangelical Boomers and some Jewish Americans, and literally no one else.",

        "text": "It is clear that what Christians mean with \"Salvation\" is different for current Rabbinic Jewish people.\n\nA Jewish person here once claimed that salvation in the Hebrew Bible is literal. Sure, there are literal events of salvation like that of the Exodus, but also Salvation is found in contexts that are more abstract or spiritual, akin to the Christian concept of Salvation.\n\nSo, I observed this, but I may be wrong, which is the reason of this post:\n - Jewish Salvation may be closer to the Western Concept of Divine Fortune or Luck or a Destiny, although they may find this comparison offensive.\n - Jewish salvation is more literal than that of Christianity, but also not totally literal.\n - Salvation in Judaism seems to be more collective and generational.\n - Christian salvation is more individual and related to the idea of the soul.\n - Jewish Salvation seems to be more guaranteed by quality of the promise God gave to to Hebrews, by blood, rather than actions or faith.\n - Christian salvation, in contrast, is more attached to actions and faith, depending on the denomination it may be both or one of these. Regardless, it is dependant on Jesus somehow.\n\nI have no idea if the idea of Salvation during Jesus' times was the same it is today for Christians or Jews, but I suspect it depended on the Jewish sect and Christianity probably inherited it from one of those. 2nd Temple's Judaism was quite diverse and heavily Hellenized, so it makes sense some Jewish people had different ideas of salvation.",

Zoroastrians, Hindus, Greeks, etc. already had schools and ideas that explored monotheism and henotheism, not to mention the many tribal gods that were worshipped in an almost monotheist fashion all around the world.\n\nClearly Islam an Christianity, specially the later, are heavily influenced by Platonism although they downplay the role of it in their faith. The Gospel of John even explicitly seem to embrace Greek concept of Logos as God, and so did many Jewish teachers of the 2nd Temple, just before it trying to rollback to more Hebrew roots after the destruction of the Temple.\n\nThe continental, golden, logical and intellectual theological and philosophical Greek ideas in religion, are heavily contrasted by the emotional, darker, obscure and opaque culture-specific desert ideas of a God.",

        "text": "Just stumbled across an interesting theory to say the least and want to see if the concept is valid in other religions… we all are familiar with the simple verse that comes straight from Jesus that “Money is the root of all evil”\n\nAfter 15 years of defecting from the Christian faith my mind just brought me back to one of my more favorite stories from childhood… the story about Jesus running into Herolds temple, and seeing wall to wall merchants, trading money for debt, exchanging goods for debt and applying interest. And then packing a back room in the temple full of money… and then using this money to take poor peoples land when they didn’t pay their debt.\n\nIt clicked for me after all these years… nearly 3000 years ago… Jesus realized at that moment that the paradise he created was already ruined… that people were enslaved to money already and were using it to destroy peoples lives. He became furious and flipped their tables and threw their money into the streets… a week later… the Jews and Romans killed Jesus… a week later…\n\nGuys… this is the reason for The Holocaust… this is the reason that Hitler became the monster that he did… he tuned into the fact that the Jewish people had determined how to control the flow and trade of money for money… this is the reason anti semitism still exists… holy shit…\n\nI’m no nazi… im not even German. I’m an American. But I’m a 3rd generation German immigrant on my fathers side… all my life… I’ve dealt with people laughing at me and my name and calling me a Nazi… and being like “oh haha, little Nazi in you huh?” And all my life I’ve been ashamed because of my home countries back ground… and never understood why?? Why do these people hate Germans? Because of Hitler? Because of the Holocaust? 75 years ago and this narrative is still controlling our minds??? How??? Every society has something that should be ashamed of!! But the narrative spread about Germans all points to one sickly twisted man in their history that acquired too much power. Why do I feel that pain?? Because I have blue eyes? Like wtf?\n\nWell it all makes sense now… and I’m not sorry… and I don’t feel bad… yes Hitler was a piece of shit… the holocaust was a terrible terrible thing… but at least I understand why tf it happened now… and why no one ever had the balls to tell me the truth…\n\nIt’s because Jews are the creators and instigators of debt, interest, and the buying and selling of money changing hands… and I always thought it was just a haha thing. Like “oh he’s a little Jewish with his money” but no…\n\nIt’s the literal foundation of slavery within our existence… not just poor black people… not just poor white people… or poor Muslims… or poor Mexicans… our entire civilization is propped up on the lie of currency… the exchange of debt between countries, lobbyists, and politicians.\n\nJews are the illumanti, Jews are the lizard people, Jews are the cause of all this sadness… their hunger for power and control of finances literally led to the death of Jesus… and it’s the exact reason that Jesus cannot return. \n\nAs long as Jews pull the strings behind the curtain… and major banks and politicians control the news and media narrative… and we continue to stay slaves to capitalism… we will never be free…\n\nI’m not saying the Nazi mentality needs to return… but since the concept has been forced back into the light by some insane people like Kanye and others.. I had to look into wtf these crazy people were talking about…\n\nAnd now I fucking get it… we are slaves to our money… and Jesus tried to be a stop to it.. and they literally crucified him for it…\n\nHoly shit…",

        "text": " Seitouism is a god-believing religion that has one core value: Justice.\n\nThe word \"Seitou\" or \" 正当 \" in kanji is a japanese word meaning \"Just\".\n\nThis religion originates from an ex-atheist japanese philosopher who rejected the idea of eternal hell and paradise, and saw it as unjust to punish finite crimes with infinite punishment, and found it petty for an entity as mighty and great as the creator of the universe to be this unnecessarily cruel.\n\nAs the philosopher imagined what an atheist society would be like, he came to the conclusion that it would be better if the society believed in an All-seeing eye which constantly records their actions than if they believed that everything they do outside of camera's view is complete secret.\n\nIn every society there are selfish people, who, if had the opportunity, would transgress and exploit people for their own selfish desires. For such people, the only deterrent to them would be punishment.\n\nOf course, the japanese philosopher believed that people could still have morals/ethics even without religion, and that religion isn't necessary to be a just and moral person. However, there will always be a portion of the society who don't value morality, or are ready to break moral/ethical codes for their own selfish goals.\n\nSuch a thing couldn't be more true given the tragedy of rape-victim Junko Furuta, who the japanese philosopher was very well aware of and was one of the main reasons why he feared living in an atheist society where there the perpetrators believe that they will get away scot-free so long as they aren't caught.\n\nAnd so Seitouism was born, a Belief in an all-just creator who will hold all transgressors accountable for their actions on a day after the destruction of the universe, where they will feel the transgressions they committed in the exact same way and for the exact same duration that the victim felt it.\n\nThe god of Seitouism knows that he has caused all of the suffering and injustice that occurred in this universe by choosing to create the universe in the way that he did, and therefore, in-order to be just, the god of Seitouism will cause himself to feel all the injustice and suffering that has ever occured in this universe in the exact same way that the victims have felt them and will also cause himself to feel all the justice and pleasure that has ever occurred in the universe in the exact same way that the receivers of that justice and pleasure.\n\nAfter the universe is destroyed, the god of Seitouism will revive all sentient conscious beings, and will cause them to feel all of the injustice and suffering that they caused upon each other in the exact same way that the victims felt it and for the same duration, after which, he will cause all of the sentient conscious being to experience the justice and pleasure that they gave to other people in the exact same way they felt it. after all of that is done, the god of Seitouism will delete all of existence, including himself, and all would be over.",

        "text": "I asked friends I knew about these questions but they couldn't find an answer, so I'm bringing it to the theologians of the internet to try to resolve these ones.\n\n**Muslims:**\n\nThe Hadith states that Muslims who die while waging Jihad against enemies of Islam will be given 72 wives in heaven (who are also virgins), with whom they can have endless physical satisfaction.\n\nThis makes Islam the only overtly sexual heaven in a major global religion, and offers a few pretty unusual questions.\n\nRegarding women: Do they also receive 72 wives, or is it 72 husbands, or do they become one of the 72?\n\nAre the 72 a new creation specifically for the sake of having sex, like a bunch of afterlife pleasure robots, or are they from earth? Are they muslim women, or is it a punishment for being one of the enemies of Islam?\n\nAre genitals a part of your soul? Are you assigned new afterlife genitals? Is your gender tied to your spirit in some metaphysical way? Do you look the same in heaven as you do on earth?\n\nSince you're still sexual in heaven, do you keep your current marriage, or is that wiped away in favor of an orgy?\n\n**Buddhists/Hindus**\n\nIt's well understood that the global population has increased significantly since the religion began in about 400 BC. In that regard, there must be three options:\n\n1. There are souls on standby.\n2. Someone somewhere else is dying frequently.\n3. Soulless husks as other souls ascend to Nirvana or Vishnu's domain.\n\nWith the reincarnation system, there should be a gradual reduction in the number of souls on earth until that number hits 0. Obviously, even the most devout Buddhist or Hindu is going to see that as a distant possibility, but how do they contend with the ever-increasing amount of life on earth? Is there a wait list to exist that got globally expedited?",

        "text": "# Intro\n\nWhen Atheist activists argue for separation of Church and State, many people are confused. They believe that separation of Church and State just is the fight for religious liberty and equality of all people. Thus, they often believe that opponents of Separation of Church and State are theocrats who want to force others to behave as they do. \n\n# Definition\n\n**Here, we will use the US version of separation of Church and State, as advocated by the Freedom From Religion Foundation****. I will provide citations where these definitions are documented.**\n\nA country has Separation of Church and State if and only if it is illegal for the government to establish any sort of law or ruling that would show any sort of respect [towards an establishment of religion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause) Under this doctrine, it is illegal for the [government to favour religious symbols on public property](https://ffrf.org/faq/item/14019-religious-holiday-displays-on-public-property). It is illegal for the government to [recognize Christian holidays as more culturally important](https://ffrf.org/publications/freethought-today/item/17826-let-s-observe-dec-25-but-not-as-christmas) than Muslim ones. It is illegal for a government official to [pray in their role as a government official](https://ffrf.org/faq/state-church/item/14015-prayers-at-government-meetings). It is illegal for the government to [recognize religious achievements](https://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/31918-ffrf-condemns-governmental-honoring-of-billy-graham). It is illegal for a teacher in a public school to [start even a voluntary club of prayer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lf4n-r-y_c) Further, it is illegal, under this doctrine, for the government to endorse any religious symbols, [no matter how culturally significant, on flags representing the government](https://ffrf.org/news/news-releases/item/32347-ffrf-denounces-sectarian-n-m-city-flag). Finally, it is illegal under this doctrine for the government to recognize even important political allies from other countries, [if those political allies happened to also be religious figures](https://ffrf.org/outreach/awards/item/13224-foundation-protests-papal-deference). \n\n# Question\n\nDo you believe it is theocratic/unreasonable/bad/ or against religious freedom to reject this doctrine as advocated by FFRF?\n\nDiscuss",
