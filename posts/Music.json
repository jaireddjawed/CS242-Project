My names George Watsky\u2014 I\u2019m a musician and writer and I go by Watsky for my music. I just released my album INTENTION and announced the Intention Tour. I started out doing spoken word as a teenager in San Franciso, was on a TV show called HBO Def Poetry, then spent 4 years touring college campuses in rental cars until a viral video allowed me to switch over to touring my music with a band. I did that for almost 10 years until the pandemic hit. I just released INTENTION, the first half of the last installment of a stealth album trilogy\u2014 years ago I worked with a linguist to create an algorithm that would allow me create a word puzzle out of the album titles. The project includes a global interactive game that has to be solved collaboratively to unlock the last half of the album. Ask me anything. :)\n\n\nIf you want to keep up with my projects, links are below:\n\nPLAY INTENTION GAME: www.Kisswatskysgluteusmaximus.xxx\n\nINTENTION ALBUM: https:\/\/createmusic.fm\/intention\n\nINTENTION TOUR: www.tour.georgewatsky.com\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@watsky\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/gwatsky\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/gwatsky\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@gwatsky\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/gwatsky\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677786907.0},{"title":"Both Ticketmaster and Artists at fault for High Ticket prices","author":"Xizen47","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Music\/comments\/11qe7eg\/both_ticketmaster_and_artists_at_fault_for_high\/","text":"In no way defending ticketmasters disgusting practices, but I think fans should put some heat on the big named artist who let ticketmaster get away with it!\n\nThe Cure is the most current example of how a band can help the fans- no dynamic pricing and no transfer of tickets unless it's face value.

A few days ago the song was available on Spotify as well as on YouTube, but today I went to listen and the song was unplayable on Spotify and the YouTube video was taken down. After doing a bit of digging I discovered that the artist herself, Dajatsun, had deleted all of her songs for the album. It was really puzzling, I looked at her profile and sure enough all the songs were unplayable but still showed up as once having been there. Here's my dilemma. I really loved that song, Talk About My Ways, as the melody was very summer-esque and it was nostalgic because it reminded me of similar guitar riffs I had heard before. Now I've been trying to search for her and her other work but apparently everything she's made was deleted abruptly, and since she's not a well known, if known at all, artist it's really hard to try to find this song on Google or YouTube. Let alone the artist itself. So if there's music people out there who could in any way help me contact her or to find that song I would really appreciate it, as it's really hard to find these Indie music composers through conventional means. I would just like to figure out why the song was taken down and if there's any chance she'll re- release it.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678675301.0},{"title":"Six Feet Under - Still Alive [Death Metal] (1995)","author":"1LinkToHyruleThemAll","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hQS1BR1Inpk","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678688611.0},{"title":"Keith Richards - 999 [Rock & Roll]","author":"MyLargeRedRocket","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/caABtLnSpX4","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678674348.0},{"title":"Key Fluid - Retribution [Synthwave]","author":"Kyler_Key","url":"https:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=FbHeDpmNqVA&feature=share","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678687636.0},{"title":"Streetz - Me Against the World [HipHop]","author":"realionairellc","url":"https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l4voNuUiUMwc0ltJJTEJITatwe7b4v-_Y","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.36,"created_utc":1678728151.0},{"title":"Streetz - Druglord [HipHop]","author":"realionairellc","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/h-2iUHB2ZyM","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678728114.0},{"title":"every song referenced in JOJO","author":"curtain_101","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Music\/comments\/11q5djy\/every_song_referenced_in_jojo\/","text":"I decided to make a whole playlist dedicated to every song referenced in JOJO!

Most people have selective memories and filter out the really bad music we also grew up with and no longer listen to. The best music seldom reaches the top 40 and tends to be put out by lesser known bands or by smaller to mid sized, record labels.  \n \n\nSo I\u2019m working on a pet project of year by year, indie and alt rock playlists. The playlists are very much catered towards Boomer and Gen-Xer tastes, but I\u2019m trying to get a very wide spectrum of as many different sub genres of rock as I can (again, selected more towards the style of rock boomers and gen xers like).  \n \n\nThe lists are all over the place style wise, but I\u2019d like to get the opinion of how they sound to the younger generations. I\u2019m not trying to capture the most popular sounds or genres, I\u2019m trying to display the wide array and the strength of newer groups.  \n \n\nSo, if you\u2019re under 40, please take a look and let me know how the song selection looks to the younger generations.   \n\n\n[Wolf Van Track](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/user\/31kaq7hapbdsw5othccevwvrorqm?si=4291ef328c514bd2)","upvote_ratio":0.53,"created_utc":1678639794.0},{"title":"Major music acts will never be affordable again, huh?","author":"Appropriate-Ad-2832","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Music\/comments\/11pj5q2\/major_music_acts_will_never_be_affordable_again\/","text":"Dynamic pricing algorithms are fucked, but unfortunately, although it sucks, I don't think the inability to see The Cure or Springsteen is gonna materially motivate or inspire people enough to create the kind of public pressure necessary to change it.

The band members received death threats, country radio stations stopped playing their music, and sales went into free fall; their single \"Landslide\" - a cover of the Fleetwood Mac song - fell from 10th to 43rd on Billboard Hot 100. \n\nNatalie Maines apologized for her statement a few days later, but would later revoke her apology. In 2006 they released an album titled *Taking the Long Way* and a documentary, *Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing*, addressing the controversy and its impact on their lives. The Chicks - who dropped Dixie from their name in 2020 - continue to record and perform today.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678460707.0},{"title":"Favorite Japanese Singers","author":"WholesomePotatuu","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Music\/comments\/11p7ucn\/favorite_japanese_singers\/","text":"I'm a native English speaker but I like Japanese songs, they're just really good.

I was always curious how each game would sound like as an \"Album\" of sorts. So I did this. There are a few exceptions though:\n\n1. Some songs ARE missing because they just aren't on Spotify\n\n1. Some songs are different versions than the ones on the actual game because the version on the game is not available on Spotify.\n\n1. I only included songs that are on the discs of each game. No DLC songs because that would just become a clusterfuck. Also a lot of the GH games share DLC so yeah.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI didn't do GH Live because I couldn't find the setlist for the game in the actual proper order the songs appear in the game and I don't own the game anymore so I can't check. Same goes for Rock Band. If you want me to put together a Rock Band series of playlists then send me the setlists for the game in the order they appear.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWithout further ado, here they are:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* [Guitar Hero](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/0uwpZv2y87Js9ZUZIyuIdV) - 41 songs, 2 hrs 38 mins \n&nbsp;\n* [Guitar Hero II](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/63LYP63LJwdujRXjhlpPpH) - 62 songs, 4 hrs 37 mins\n&nbsp;\n* [Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/7ffWjyD1fAD6MY9IEt5LJv) - 62 songs, 4 hrs 11 mins\n&nbsp;\n* [Guitar Hero: Aerosmith](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/3hImxa49RmcX6SSRiES8qL) - 40 songs, 2 hrs 46 mins\n&nbsp;\n* [Gitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/7srg0qfcNg6KQhzVS2J8wr) - 30 songs, 1 hr 57 mins.
