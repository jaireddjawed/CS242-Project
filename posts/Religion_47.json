My name is David Christy, I am a doctoral candidate in the Pastoral Counseling Department at Loyola University Maryland. I'm recruiting participants for an online survey as a part of my dissertation research. The purpose of my study is to examine how coping resources, including faith and spirituality, can help individuals in the face of various stressors.\n\nMost of our current psychological understandings of religion and spirituality are based on studies of Christians. I'm trying to expand and add nuance to that knowledge base by collecting data from a wide variety of religious traditions, with a focus on people practicing minority faiths within the US (e.g., Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Pagans, and so on). Christians and people with no religious affiliation are also encouraged to participate; this will allow me to draw meaningful comparisons between groups. The data generated by this study will help therapists, counselors, and social workers better understand the roles of religion and spirituality in well-being.\n\nParticipation involves responding to several questionnaires that measure your experience, personality, spirituality, and personal functioning; as well as providing non-identifying demographic information. Completing all the surveys should take between 30 to 45 minutes. If you are 18 years or older and interested in participating either click on the link below or copy and paste it into a web browser.\n\nhttps://loyola.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6zAuJX7eB5hyNX7",

Reading through the various texts, one could conclude that the tone is rather the same (very similar in the Quran and Torah). \n\nAll three of these religions believe that there is a sacred name that is revered by god. In their scriptures King Solomon (Prophet Suleiman) had a vizier who brought the throne of the queen of Sheba within the blinking of an eye. He was not a demon but rather a human who used god most sacred name during supplication. God willed for that throne to be placed in Solomons palace. \nThe same goes for the story of Balaam that is mention in all three religions, he knew the sacred name of god. \n\nSo what is this Sacred name of God? Is it lost forever? Anybody know of this? \nIt's quite interesting. \nI sincerity believe that there is truth in these 3 religions. None are like them in this world. ",

        "text": "I've had a very long religious journey, but I've ended up here, and I think this is where I'm staying. I have a philosophical belief based loosely on Jediism, with the universe having a spiritual energy I call the Force.\n\nUnfortunately, when I try to explain this to people, they think I'm joking or I just tell me I'm a Jedi for parody sake. They often ask \"So do you think Star Wars actually happened?\" or \"Do you use a lightsaber?\". I don't really care about the Star Wars aspect as much as the belief in a Force. I truly believe there is a connection between all living things.\n\nI have thought about calling it Qi instead of the Force, but then I wouldn't really have a name for the religion itself. I've thought about calling myself a Taoist, but it doesn't quite match my beliefs of how the energy works. And I've thought about calling myself a Buddhist, but I don't believe in some aspects such as the system of Karma.\n\nThere are also aspects of Jediism that I don't necessarily agree with either, and there aren't exactly different denominations. For example I don't think students of the Force necessarily need a teacher, nor is it enirely black and white with the light and dark side. What I care most about is meditation to feed my connection to the Force for personal growth. I then am able to use my connection to help me throughout my journey of life.\n\nI guess I fall under the category of Pantheism, but I know most people wouldn't understand what this means. Is there a more common belief system I don't know about that follows what I believe more closely? Or should I just say that I don't fall into a common category? Should I just write my own doctrine to read to people when they inevitably ask?",

        "text": "A bit of back ground- I was brought up in a very atheist household by my mother. My step-father was raised mormon but did not practice while he and my mother were together. My grandmother tried to push me into christianity at a young age. Come high school, I openly jumped into paganism. Some witchcraft, leaning more into druidism. I was a solo practitioner, got pretty good at some spells and tarot. Fast forward to this year and I am now 28. My husband is pagan. My children have been raised without religion (I never prayed or practiced in front of them but answered question about any religion they had that I could - Judaism, Islam, Christianity, and Paganism) \nIn April I had something traumatic happen to my family regarding myself. My marriage was falling apart, my life was falling apart. I was arrested under false pretenses, my husband was deployed.... just everything was coming undone. I was honestly on my way to the garage to turn on the car and swallow a bottle of muscle relaxers and end it when I got a phone call from a friend asking me to come to church with her the next day. I went with her and my life did a full 180. I truly felt a peace I had never felt wash over my heart that day. I fell to my knees at the cross and cried for help and i got it. My husband came home from deployment and we have began mending our marriage. My legal troubles are all but over. I feel peace where before I felt anger. I feel joy where before I felt scared. I never before understood how someone could just say \"its gods plan\" and accept it, but now I say that and I do accept it and I cant explain it!\n\nBut my problem: \nMy husband is NOT on board with converting. Not that I've asked him to or expect him to. I'm perfectly fine if he chooses to continue to be pagan so long as he respects my change of heart. He still wants to celebrate Haloween and Yule and Christmas with the kids like we normally do. Which again, I'm fine with, these are the traditions they know and love. My problem is internal. I know the truth about these holidays. How they were adopted by the Christian's and Catholics of old to convince the European pagans to convert. Santa is Odin. Halloween is a witches strongest night. Easter eggs are homage to Oestra.... I believe there is one god. I believe over time he has sent prophets to earth in different forms, including Jesus and Moses, and Mohammed. Further back, it could be argued he sent Thor and Hercules- basically I believe that all the religions hold one universal truth and they all tie into one another. That being said, coming up on the holiday season, I'm already feeling anxiety thinking about how jesus' birth will be falsely portrayed (as happening in the winter) or how a negative light will be cast on those who dress up for halloween by my church. \n\nAre there any former pagans turned Christian's out there who can help me? Is it normal for me to feel like I'm betraying my old beliefs if I dont defend them? Im worried now that in my heart I may not be as fully committed to being a Christian as I thought I was. \nTIA",

Plus there are strict rules that forbid anyone under 21 from doing any adult things lile drinking or renting a car (there's even a 21+ rating in the Singapore film rating system). Even at 20 you're still treated like a kid. I knew my sister's boyfriend was 20 at the time and he was in a children's hospital. They didn't let him back in after he turned 21.\n\nAlso, if all people under 20 really are children then that would most likely encourage sexual relationships between 18-year-olds and underage teens. Really think about it, a relationship between an 18-year-old and a minor would be normalizied and that's really not something we want to happen.\n\nKeep in mind that I'm not trying to offend any Christians. I actually have never read the bible and I'm just asking you if any of this is true.

        "text": "This all started out when I wanted to listen to a Christian podcast for my weekly walks. I simply wanted something \"to do\" and I've been wanting to get closer to God.\n\n(I \"grew up\" Christian, but there was never a true emphasis to follow it. I went to church but stopped around the age of 11; so I don't think I ever got \"the big picture\" of all the beliefs and teachings.)\n\nI've been researching podcasts and finding out that I may not be as Christian as I once thought.\n\nThe Trinity is kinda a new concept to me and I half believe/understand it (half don't).\nI believe reincarnation can occur (but not always: sometimes you go to heaven, -but hell is eternal).\nI believe that if you are good (and intentions are good), you can go to Heaven (whether you believe in God or not).\nI believe God is love, and while there are many religions (with different \"distortions\"), we all worship one \"being\" (even those who don't believe in a \"person\" but say they are spiritual). \nI believe people should live the way they want, as long as they're not hurting anyone.\n\nI think those are the big ones.\nI took an online quiz and I got these results: http://www.findmyreligion.com/results.php?dematch=1537320271\nI know these things are to be taken with a grain of salt, but I really agree with the written part. I mainly have pagan beliefs but am \"gnostic\". I can accept that, but I don't think I can listen to a pagan podcast without learning about God (which was my whole point).\n\nI believe in the Bible (the stories at least) and thought a good podcast could interpret it for me (literal as well as apply it homily). but I'm not sure where to go. Do I stick with a Christian podcast and ignore the parts I don't agree with? Do I call myself a pagan who believes in God?\n\nSorry for the long text and thank you for all who read it through. Any help, resources, thoughts, etc... are appreciated.\n\n-I may hang out for a little while here but will probably be going to bed soon. Will answer tomorrow late morning.",

Not necessarily Abrahamic religions but rather religion in general.\n\nFor example, the different type of people who play video games: analysts, diplomats, sentinels and explorers. If religion were designed to appeal to people in this way could it be more effective as a common game that allows for positive action between us? It makes sense to me since I see religion as a way to get people to participate in life.\n\nDisregarding religion's many faults as well as the debate over the necessity of religion in general for the sake of this particular argument, those things are certainly worth discussing as well.",

At present, the bodies of those who have been punished are only buried when this has been requested and permission granted; and sometimes it is not permitted, especially where persons have been convicted of high treason. Even the bodies of those who have been sentenced to be burned can be claimed, in order that their bones and ashes, after having been collected, may be buried.\"\n\nsource: https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/D48_Scott.htm#XXIV\n\nI don't understand what is being said because the author seems to contradict himself harshly. At one point he states that bodies should NOT be refused to their relatives but then he says that at present times they need permission. Is he making a new clarification saying \"this is what we do right now as I am writing this, but it is wrong\"?  the wording seems very ambiguous because to me, on the first few reads it seems like he is saying that bodies should not be refused burial period, then he explains what is wrongly being practiced at the moment.\n\nIn short, is the author simply explaining another aspect of this rule (not allowing burial without permission) or is he showing that, no matter what burial should never be refused while stating that the rule is presently not being observed fully?",

        "text": "To those who don't know, Yom Kippur is Judaism's holiest day of the year. It's a 25 hour fast where Jews pray and beg God for forgiveness for the past year and for a beneficial judgment for the coming year. Even most secular Jews will fast on Yom Kippur, even if they do it while watching TV and playing Xbox. \n\nAbout myself, I came from a religious family, but left it nearly 15 years ago when I realized that I had too many questions and not enough answers. Since then I went to one extreme of eating a cheeseburger on Yom Kippur (eating on YK, cheeseburger isn't kosher, etc.) to mellowing out and slowly getting back in touch with Judaism, not as a religion, but more as a system of morals and a common tradition I and my wife and kids can share with the rest of my family, all who are still religious. My wife is Jewish (not religious) and mainly puts up with the things I do, but even she said that she doesn't think she wants to fast anymore.\n\nAnd the thing is, I'm beginning to see her point of view. It's not as if throughout the rest of the year, I'm this amazing Jew that I can feel it's cool to hit up God with requests that he give me a good year and ignore everything I did in the past year. On the other hand, this is something I grew up with, and it's something I want to pass down to my kids as part of the tradition which I mentioned before. \n\nBasically, I need advice on where to go from here, I just want opinions. I know this is a decision I can only make for myself, but I want to share with someone who can maybe put things into perspective for me. ",

I haven't told her this because 1) I worried it would hurt her and cause her unneeded stress. and 2) it's never come up so I just didn't feel a need or opportunity to let her know.  Well, I worried this day would  come and now she is asking me to co author  a post for her blog that incorporates how I felt God lead me /God's voice/ God's push etc etc.... none of those things ring true for me and I don't feel comfortable attaching my name to something that is untrue nor do I want to lie to her or anyone else. What is the best way to break it to her :(   Thanks!",

Can anyone make heads or tails of what it is this woman is trying to say?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI Am free under God &amp; by his power. &amp; I owe no man, or credit card company, or no lien holder, like I'm sure you do &amp; you wont find my kind supporting men like you, but I hold liens on your kind &amp; you know not untill I'm ready to make you pay. Like I said, I'm Gods child free of fornication, &amp; your Ceaser child in fornication with the mammon &amp; the knowledge of the branches of the 'Religion Tree' of supposed good/evil. I come Like a Thief, as written in Revelations to crooks like crooks did to Christ. A child in the grindstone, &amp; my kind grind your kinds unto powder as you help &amp; speak for thieves. My kind &amp; your kind are only similar in image &amp; you never will have power over me, I do my will in the law of the land &amp; with the law of the land. But who are you for but the dumb, deaf, &amp; blind making you yourself pay.﻿\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm not a sovereign, I'm constitutional, &amp; I Am that I Am in my Fathers known name, in My Commandment to The God of Heaven &amp; Earth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; it is you who eat of the Branches of the 'Religion Tree' of the knowledge of good/evil, wherewith continuing to eat, you will 'SURLY DIE'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRepent you yourself of such, because it is my kind who eat 'The Family Tree', aka The Tree of Life wherewith I have permission to eat by Je-Sus, as you pronounce His name wrong in unawarness, not knowing my Father personally, who says I have the Right to Live, choosing Life. Even unto Everlasting as written my kind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow go say as your branch of the religion tree says, accusing the Righteous whom the God of gods hath made, saying what you said above, which will kill you yourself, not knowing how to pronounce the name of the God of Heaven, the most famous name for God upon earth, accusing me of sin, while you eat of that which my kind eat not, being free from the law of sin &amp; death by the Holy Spirit of Truth my Father gave me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou dont know Je-Sus, aka Zeus, to speak to my kind who know Him of Him, seeing YOU KNOW HIM NOT. LMHO. For His know His name being Children of God. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; your kinds, accuse my kinds, day &amp; night of sin, as the Revelation says of your kinds who perish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, I say as the Heavenly Father says which is 'Thou shall surly die' eating the forbidden tree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you say as Satan, whose child you are, which you prove, implying  if you eat the Tree of Sinners, wherewith the wager of your sin is death, you 'shall NOT surly die'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe my Father, whose name I can pronounce, whose word I know is TRUTH. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; you repeat the words of that which Be-Liar, the Satanic person you prove to be, eating off the branches of the Religion Tree of the supposed knowledge of good/evil, still swearing you see, as a child of that which killed the prophets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut FYI, I can lead you to water, but My Fathers water &amp; meat, you chose not to drink &amp; eat, &amp; I Am come to help the Righteous, for I Am with 'ABLE, the Man Child', whose place Christ stood in as 'The Good Shephard', aka, the LAMB of GOD. :) :) Your religious mouth cannot forgive me. lmho, nor can your rotten fruit you eat in religion meaning your fake teachers, for you have no power over me, or Life, as God does. lol We are the 'Children of the Living' as written.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChrist came for you sinners already &amp; you continue in sin, so why dont YOU yourself, 'Paul of the Demons family', repent. Lol \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut one thing My Father has told me of my works while on this planet, which is the parable in Genesis, that I should reveal it to the children of hell like you, swearing you see, but all your sins remain, &amp; ALSO, that I should reveal it to His children, the Righteous law abider, in Gods law &amp; in the law of the land, the Constitution, like Christ said we should also be, that to you both, the righteous to be (not you Paul of the Demon seed, but my kinds, the God seed) &amp; the unrighteous to stay unrighteous, (your kinds), lol, I should reveal how to pronounce the name Je-Sus, as well in telling both the same of what sin is &amp; 'MY LIFE SHALL BE SPARED' as written which the Lord GOD spoke Himself, who you are not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the Name of the God of Heaven is in my forehead, (Wisdom of God) not the mark of your beast aka (The Wisdom of the Religion Tree of Satan) with the Government of the polluters of earth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn original tongue of the Jews, the letters - Ye, He, Ie, &amp; Je, are not heard, but are as spoken as silent as a breath. So concerning the names per toungue of man, Je-Suis aka Je-Sus, aka He-Zeus, aka Ie-Sous, aka Ye-Suis, the only heard sound, sounds 'ZEUS', aka Sus, aka Sous, aka Suis, the real pronunciation of the name of My Father, who I see, hear &amp; know, the God of Heaven, whose name Christ came in, as Christ said in red letters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChrists name, you call Christ not, nor do you know it as written. But you call Christ a mispronounced name for Our Father, meaning my Father &amp; Christs Father yet to be the Father of all again as written. Even you if you will, but I doubt it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChrists name I also know, because He is of the Father &amp; all our Spirit is one. But you know not what manner of Spirit you are of in a mispronounced name. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; for you who know not yet the Truth to live, &amp; want me to prove Je-Suis name is 'I AM' as I stated above, whose name I speak in, in English, (seeing my kind actually know Him, knowing His parrables), \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; Paul Demon's kind, know him not, knowing not His Word I speak. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut.... look on You tube typing the 'Je-Suis Charlie Hebdo campaign' where the reporter died for His name sake, shot by a Muslim, &amp; find that in cold blooded English, 'I AM Charlie Hebdo' is 'Je-Suis Charlie Hebdo' in their toungue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTherefore, I myself come in the name of the God of Heaven, in His most famous known name, known to the whole world as Zeus, &amp; 'I AM that I AM' says in complete English, 'ZEUS THAT ZEUS', spelling Je-Sus that Je-Sus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLol But what of you 'Paul proven of the Demon's family' ? If your blind, deaf &amp; dumb still, stay that way. It dosent effect My Life as written. Your sin is not my sin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome correct or dont waste your demon breath, for My Breath is proven of the Father in Genesis, who formed &amp; made me, come to tell the Truth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; for others as you, who recieve not the Truth yet, your Religions cannot save you, &amp; their graveyards of the dead prove the Lord God, my Father is the TRUTH.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; Paul of the demon's fake plural father's in his religious family, Be-Liar's......\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOR THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE OF YOUR HARD LABORS !! AMEN TO THE TRUTH, &amp; A BLESSING BE TO THOSE NOT OFFENDED BY MY WORDS, SEEING I COME IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FATHER FOR ALL HIS CHILDREN TO SEE. :) :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; IF YOUR EYE SHOULD OFFEND YOU 'PAUL OF THE DEMONS FAMILY' PLUCK IT OUT. FOR WE COME AS THE GRINDSTONE &amp; THE OTHER STONES BELIEVING RELIGIONS LIARS, SHALL BE GROUND UNTO POWDER IN OUR SIGHT, AS THEY ARE ON TV. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCOME AWAY FROM ALL THE EVIL FRUIT OF THE BRANCHES OF RELIGION &amp; WARN OTHERS SO, &amp; YOU YOURSELF STANDING RIGHTEOUS CHOOSING GOD TODAY, SHALL BE SPARED, &amp; RECIEVE THE RESURRECTION OF THE LIVING, &amp; THE JUST, WHICH PAUL OF THE DEMON BREATH FAMILY KNOWS NOT, WALKING WITH THE DEAD IN RELIGION. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAS CHRIST SAID OF PAUL DEMON'S KIND, LOL LET THE DEAD BURY THE DEAD, SEEING HIS KIND DOES NOT LET THE WORD OF GOD SAVE HIM. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBUT HE SWEARS HES SAVED ALREADY, &amp; I AM DAMNED, WHILE HE IS EATING OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE RELIGION TREE, OF THE SUPPOSED KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD &amp; EVIL OF SATAN, CONNING MEN IN A MISPRONOUNCED NAME OF THE GOD OF HEAVEN. LOL, DONT FALL FOR IT, FOR HE SHALL SURLY DIE WITH HIS RELIGION.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOW 'PAUL OF THE DEMON'S FAMILY', THOU SHALL SURLY DIE, AS SAITH THE FATHER OF GODS &amp; MEN, FROM THE BEGINING, BEING THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; SHORTLY HE SHALL TAKE HIS POWER BACK FROM THOSE WHO HATE HIM AS WRITTEN. NOW GO AHEAD &amp; BLASPHEME MY FATHERS NAME, ZEUS, THE NAME OF THE GOD OF HEAVEN AS DEMONS DO, &amp; ARE WRITTEN TO DO. :( :(﻿\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow watch 'Paul of the Demon's family' attempt to entice me to eat of his branch of the 'Religion Tree' of his knowledge which is stupidity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour kinds Paul who are Satans kinds, may have fooled 1st Adam &amp; his 1st wife Lilith, but due to Gods Word with Christ, you cant fool me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; As I said, you Paul are too stupid to rule over me &amp; are not my husband man, nor are you My God, nor are you the Lord God my Father, nor are you the Constitution, to tell me what to do. Lol hahaa, &amp; you never will be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come with The Chosen of the Lord, who is ABLE standing below in place of the Good Shephard !! :) :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope everyone fooled by religion &amp; the polluters of earth &amp; sea, may come out folly &amp; chose to help save mens lives today, by calling the flock out of religion, which is the wide, broud road to shame &amp; destruction, &amp; their worm which dies not. For Gods judgement is life still, even after the sinners taste death. Shall blasphamy be forgiven ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHear the Call of the Good Shephard &amp; come away from religion &amp; repent of eating it &amp; tell another the same &amp; regardless of if they hear or not, you yourself shall be saved by God's Might &amp; become a Son of God in His image &amp; likeness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCome away from that which is evil &amp; do well. For if you do well, you will be accepted by the Father, if not, Sin aka a murderer in sheeps clothing from another religion, even, the Big Bad Wolf, OR the law of the Big Dogs of the land, &amp; possibly with a lien holder, like me, will be standing at your door as a thief, or in my case, 'Like a thief'. Lol hahaa !! :) :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor all things are given to Gods Son as inheratance, &amp; He will give to His whatever they will, as written of His flock who ask of His Father, in His name, to them, meaning my kind, to me also, it shall be given as written. &amp; He never goes back on His Words which are written.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp; Know this 'Paul of the Demon's family' I'm glad I know His Words &amp; I'm proud to be of God the Father, in my Beginnings.﻿\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "Hi there! Today, it was \"the day of prayer\" in my country, and for that occasion the catholic and protestant community met for one communal service. Now, what followed was probably one of the more memorable sermons by our catholic priest: In which he appealed to common sense in light of tradition by using an allegory in which jesus gets asked why his followers don't wash their hands before eating, as is custom. On an even more surprising note, he also talked on the topics of stagnation in the church, and how wrongful it is to simply ignore many great problems, such as the sexual abuse of children, or shift the conversation away from it. He loudly encouraged to speak up, and not to stay quiet, and commented on how our bishops were completely missing the issue currently. I found it incredibly awe-inspiring that a pastor would so openly say that the church is doing some things which are wrong, and that it's bishops and even cardinals also are only humans and can do wrong/be wrong. As a rather young adult I find this a rather unorthodox approach, but true to the virtues of the church: As a part of it, it is also the simple human's duty to change the church in light of what happens, if need be, or to revise what previously was thought. \nI just had to share this with someone",
