        "text": "Hey all. I started in a junior role recently as the sole programmer. I have to rewrite a legacy application that's right now disorderly and it has code mostly written by a mechanical engineer who did it part-time. This guy's code is unreadable. He has been pushing reams of comments and notes to himself and educational links with no organisation and no comments on the code itself. It's some of the worst written code I've ever seen. I've come in and I've been doing really well. Meeting task deadlines set by myself in tandem with our boss, and I have a hold on the entire project and its architecture.\n\nSadly this mechanical engineer is playing up. I was nothing but polite to him since I started, I even gave a bit of praise where I could to build a rapport, but he has this gigantic ego and is incredibly insecure on top. He thinks his code is the best thing since sliced bread. \n\nNow he is getting involved in my work as if he is my supervisor or boss or something. When I accomplished the task he had not been able to do before I joined, he kept gnawing at me trying to catch me out on my solution. I answered all of his questions with confidence and correctly and I had the working solution to back up why it had worked - like why these technologies and so on. \n\nThen again today I needed his help for a second time, and he told me to look it up. It was literally a domain question that he could have answered off the top of his head, and I super rarely asked him anything since starting since he is so bad at explaining, but even this request to give me a simple list of things he would not do without patronising me. He is looking for chances to undermine me whenever he can. And this was me reaching out in attempt to build rapport in his domain area, not technical. There are a few other examples. \n\nSo far how I've dealt with him:\n\nWhen he got involved in the task he failed to do, by trying to tell me what to do when I had already done that thing, I immediately told him to leave the implementation to me. He didn't get the message and went back and forth on the technical a few times rather than help me with the domain knowledge. \n\nI will have to work with this guy for this domain specific knowledge though I am limiting that in so far as possible.\n\nWhat can I do about him? If I'm answering back sharply, nobody else cares. I'm the only programmer. He has also arrogantly mentioned his domain expertise when there was no call for it at all. I am sick of him. HELP!",

First 3-4 weeks are unpaid. Then, I'd get paid minimum wage for the rest of training. They'd then have me relocate somewhere and do a 2 month contract. He said he'd have a position in 10-15 days but wouldn't know the name for it so I'd need to just train for this and hopefully get placed. Was told there's a 90% placement rate and I'd be on the east or west coast. Is this worth it? Is this normal or is something likely to go wrong at some point? The one other reddit thread on this company seems to point at them being legit. Just nervous about the process itself as I don't have a lot of money to mess around with.

I've reached a point where I've realized that tech support is the red-headed stepchild of IT and people in my line of work are a dime a dozen. It's not fulfilling, and I don't enjoy spending my days supporting high-value clients who aren't grateful. \n\nI took on a lot of extra stuff that wasn't asked of me in hopes that it would help me move up to something better. An example of this is spearheading a team for new tech we brought on board, onboarding new people, running daily standups, etc. This should've brought me to senior engineer status, but recently I was told that there's a new rule in place where I have to wait another year.\n\nUnderstandably, I'm angry about this and feel like I'm just wasting my time. \n\nRecently, I've taken a huge interest in graphics programming, so I've dedicated my time to relearning linear algebra, C++, and how to work with shaders and graphics APIs. \n\nAt this point, my heart isn't in my current job right now, and this is literally the only thing causing me stress at this point, and I really want to focus on carving out this new path.\n\nIf you were in my position, would you pursue and new job in the same field that's less busy? Or would you stick it out while you learned something for a possible new career path? I just hate this feeling of aversion I get whenever it's time to start my day.",

I specialise in Web Development and have a preference for frontend dev. My friend however, has focused much more on the backend side of things in both his internships and university education.\n\nHe mentioned that since we are computing students, it might be wiser if we start our careers as Backend Developer since he feels like the barriers of entry are higher for non-computing students. Additionally, it’ll be easier for us to hop from Backend Dev to Fullstack/Frontend Dev as compared to Frontend Dev to Fullstack/Backend Dev because you learn much more things that are harder to pick up such as writing code for business logic, diving into some infrastructure stuff, learning how to set up load balancing properly. I was also wondering if it is easier for a Backend Dev to rise to a management role/promote as compared to a Frontend Dev since you might have a better understanding of the business logic.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this matter?",

With less hiring, I’ve made the difficult decision to further reduce the size of our recruiting team. We will let recruiting team members know tomorrow whether they’re impacted. We expect to announce restructurings and layoffs in our tech groups in late April, and then our business groups in late May. In a small number of cases, it may take through the end of the year to complete these changes. Our timelines for international teams will also look different, and local leaders will follow up with more details.

        "text": "I've been working with Java for 2 years and at this point I'd like to try something more modern. I never really liked Java and haven't grown to appreciate it these 2 years, but other than the tech stack it was a nice job and I was gaining experience so I didn't want to switch. Before that I worked about 3 years part time as a student, but mostly on embedded applications so it's not very relevant experience.\n\nThe issue I'm having is that I'm just getting rejected right away from any job I apply to and I'm not sure why. My guess is that my CV technically doesn't match the requirements because technically I can't say I have X years of experience in Golang or Rust or whatever, even though any developer could tell you it really doesn't take much time to adjust to a new language. I'm eager and willing to learn and I try to show that whenever I can, in my CV, in any \"Tell us about yourself\" question and all that. I can understand that companies want relevant experience, but I don't understand why I'm not at least given a coding test to assess my skills.\n\nIt has to be said that I'm not searching in my current area because I'm planning to move abroad, within the EU, idk how much of a factor this is. Based on my research, I think I've been giving completely reasonable salary expectations for the area I want to move to as well.\n\nI guess I'm probably not alone in this situations, so can you guys give any tips for what I might do better in this situation? Even just getting an interview would be great at this point.",

Not gonna lie, it's slowly wearing me down but I'm not even sure where to start.\n\nOn an average day, I wake up at 8 AM, online at around 8:30 AM. After that, I'm on back-to-back calls and then catching up on emails or the previous day's pull requests or teammate chats. By the time this routine is over, it's around 1 PM and that's around when I take some time for lunch, but not really. Typically a stressful hour, because you can always count on a new email or message right when I go for lunch, so the whole time I'm anxious to get back so I can deal with it.\n\nI don't really get to start working on my stuff (aka code) until maybe 2-3 PM or so. At which point, I really only have about 4 hours left in the actual work day to get some work done. Half of it is almost always wasted on reviewing pull requests, so I'm left with an average of 2 hours for serious code work, putting aside whatever I managed to do while multitasking.\n\nCome 5-6 PM, I just can't work anymore even though I still have so much left to finish. I have to spend some time with my partner, eat dinner, sit down, unwind. But typically, I'll only spend maybe 2 hours of that sitting down for dinner and time, the rest I'll probably be catching up on chores.\n\nAt that point, it's around 10 PM. At which point, I shower, then hop back on my computer taking advantage of the quiet work calendar for a couple of hours. I work until maybe 2-3 AM, then take an hour or so for myself to unwind and listen to music or browse the internet (like now).\n\nThen bed by around 4-ish, and back up again by 8.",

They also do not provide company equipment.\n\nI was compiling a list of strengths that I thought could place me in a better light or rationalize higher salary:\n\n* Bachelors degree with 3.93 GPA average, 4.0 GPA in computer science courses\n* 6 months of internship / industry experience, one with a well-known company\n* Living in Seattle where the cost of living is higher than the national average\n* Exceptional knowledge in their tech stack\n\nI want to counter with $65k or $70k salary, but I feel like this is a huge bump and I don't want to lose an offer if that is my only option right now. Any advice on how I should proceed?",

        "text": "So, I'm five years into my career, two years as a Back end dev, and three years as a Data Engineer.\n\nOne thing I've noticed is even though I'm confident in my work, both soft skills and technical skills. \n\nMy issue is speed and focus; my development speed is slow; I've written plenty of code over the years, but I feel my speed has never increased. \n\nI'll plan and start to code, lose my train of thought, reread my code to remember what I was doing, lose it again, double/triple/quadruple reread the same code before I move on to the next part I want to write. This cycle slows down my coding considerably 3-10x sometimes, depending on how often/easily I'm losing it.\n\nSubjectively speaking, tickets that should take me less than a day can take up to three, and tickets that should take me three days can take up to a week. \n\nI know because I've had weeks (few and far between) when I'm hit with a flow state of hyperfocus and speed where I can finish so much work I make my normal self look incompetent. I haven't figured out how to replicate it on demand.\n\nFor people who have figured out how to get it on demand. What works for you?",

        "text": "At my company, there are 4 different managers that handle about 10 different staff members, who are a mix of developers and other tech employees. \n\nIn 2021, a colleague of mine started working here full time fresh out of university, and after a full year, his manager gave him a $10K raise, which is pretty big, along with title change from \"Junior dev\" to \"Dev\".\n\nI was a fresh grad that started here in 2022, and after an annual review (usually held around tax season), my own manager (who only started here a few months back replacing another manager) didn't give me that big of an increase nor the title change, citing \"you just finished your first full year, you did a great job this past year and your team loves you, keep at it and just be patient, you will be rewarded eventually\". They seem to have an old-school mentality where if you're fresh out of school you need to wait a number of years before you get a big increase. While I don't necessarily think I'm entitled to more money than I deserve, it seems unfair that my colleague's manager at the time was more favorable to reward them based on their achievements rather than their experience. \n\nBoth my colleague and I had achieved similar feats, leading big projects and doing a lot of code maintenance. In fact, it was my colleague who recommended that I ask for the big increase / title change because I worked so hard this past year and since he asked last year, I should ask this year. \n\nOf course, different manager, different mindset. \n\nWhat sucks is that this company is amazing and I have no desire to leave, but having the manager that I do instead of the manager that my colleague does makes me miss out not only on a lot of $$, but also on a transition away from just being a Junior dev. \n\nIs this common in workplaces for one manager to not give big raises but another one at the same company to be more generous?",

After looking at the options, I’ve decided that I would like to minor in EE so I have the option to work with lower level/embedded stuff in the future if I want to. However, my school also offers a Computer Engineering program, which is basically a CS + EE degree. I’ve looked at the requirements for both options and the classes I would have to take are literally the exact same except for maybe 1 or 2. My concerns are that:\n\n1. Computer Engineering might be looked at by employers as a hardware degree even though at my school 75% of it is software. I want to focus on software, so I’m worried I’ll be looked upon negatively when compared to other CS students.\n\n2. I’ve heard that minors don’t actually mean anything significant, so if I ever decide to go into embedded stuff, an employer would rather hire an EE/CmpE.\n\nI guess what I’m asking is if CmpE students are looked down upon vs CS students when applying to software roles and if an EE minor is enough if I want to work on embedded systems/software.",

My interests lie in data science and computer vision, but my math skills are not as strong as I would like them to be. Recognizing that building a solid foundation will take time, I have been seeking job opportunities in software development, leveraging my existing programming skills and one year of experience. Additionally, I am working on a master's thesis related to deep learning and computer vision, with plans to graduate in May 2024.\n\nCurrently, I am looking for a summer internship in software or machine learning. Fortunately, I have been offered an internship position at Blackrock Inc as a Summer Analyst, which is a nine-week program with decent pay. While I do not have any experience or knowledge in finance, aside from general knowledge, I was able to secure the position due to my strong python and SQL skills. However, given my lack of interest in finance and my shortcomings in this area, I am uncertain about how to move forward with my career goals.\n\nHere are some questions that have arisen for me:\n\n1. I've applied to 150+ software-related jobs but haven't had any luck getting interviews. If I do manage to score some interviews, should I go for subpar compensation or advancement opportunities, or take a non-CS job offer instead?\n2. When I start applying for full-time jobs in the next recruitment cycle, what will recruiters think when they see my work experience as a summer analyst?\n3. How can I increase my chances of getting software-related interviews and securing a job with better compensation and advancement opportunities?\n4. Am I spending my time and efforts in the right way, considering my interests and career goals?\n\nCould you do me a favor and answer one or more of the questions? Your input would be super helpful and I'd appreciate it!",
