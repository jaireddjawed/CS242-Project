Even though, say a 13 year old male having sex with a 30 year old woman is a horrific sex crime, it feels like if I were a woman it would have been more visibly painful. Like a woman at that age getting fucked by a man three times older would probably hurt. And even though I guess I can’t say it didn’t hurt….there was a part that felt good. But shameful too. I guess that’s the part that hurt. Not being emotionally ready at all. Not being ready to have an orgasm in front of an inside a woman 3 times older. But I really wanted to fuck her. So how bad did she fuxk me up? Pretty bad huh?",
