Some are made with a dough derived from ground rice and are filled with seasoned chicken or pork with the addition of peanuts and other seasonings such as sugar. In some places, such as the Pampanga and Batangas provinces, the tamales are wrapped in banana leaves, but sweet corn varieties from the Visayas region are wrapped in corn husks similar to the sweet corn tamales of the American Southwest and Mexico. Because of the work involved in the preparation of tamales, they usually only appear during the special holidays or other big celebrations. Various tamal recipes have practically disappeared under the pressures of modern life and the ease of fast food. Several varieties of tamales are also found in the Philippines. Tamales, tamalis, tamalos, pasteles, are different varieties found throughout the region. Some are sweet, some are savory, and some are sweet and savory. Mostly wrapped in banana leaves and made of rice, either the whole grain or ground and cooked with coconut milk and other seasonings, they are sometimes filled with meat and seafood, or are plain and have no filling. There are certain varieties, such as tamalos, that are made of a sweet corn masa wrapped in a corn husk or leaf.\n\nAre there any tamales surviving in the Philippines today?

Does anyone know why Appalachia didn't develop it's own style of barbecue? Think of it this way- coastal Carolina, the Piedmont, SC, east Tennessee, they all developed their own identifiable styles of barbecue. For the record, NC Piedmont and Central SC do NOT extend into true Appalachia. I'm talking about Asheville, Boone, Knoxville, etc, true southern Appalachia. My best guess is that it historically boils down to a lack of slaves/plantation culture/wealth- after all, barbecues in the antebellum period tracked those principles. Still, there was a 50-75 year gap between the end of the Civil War and the start of barbecue as a commercial retailed product, where barbecue became more of a common \"poor mans\" food. I would just like an explanation why southern Appalachia never developed an identifiable style of barbecue. Thanks. ",
