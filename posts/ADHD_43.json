        "text": "**tl;dr 2: It started as a simple post asking about your experiences with medications if you were not happy with Elvanse/Vyvanse. But then I got hyperfixed on it, and now it's a long ass post and I want to make a evaluation.** \n\nIt is totally okay if you don't care, I had fun hyperfixating, so for me - it is a win already :-)\n\nI tried to make this post as ADHD-friendly as possible, but images are not allowed, so you have to use your imagination here:\n\n**tl;dr 1:**\n\n**You were disappointed with Elvanse/Vyvanse?** *stock picture of a sad and lonely teddy bear* \n\n**You found another medication that helped you better?** *stock photo of a person clenching fists in front of a generic white wall*\n\n**I WANT YOUR STORY!!!** *Uncle Sam Poster* \n\n\\---\n\nSince Elvanse/Vyvanse is one of the most popular and desired medications for ADHD, I would like to collect **hopefully** **success stories from people for whom Elvanse/Vyvanse did not help**. Especially because this subreddit seems like a timeless archive, and this information might help someone who is probably going to come across this post in a few months or years. Especially because affordable generics will flood the market in the fall at the latest (which is great), many people will make their own experiences with this drug - some of which may also not be successful. **I just want a glimmer of hope that it might work better with one of the next drugs :-)**\n\n# Hyperfixation starts here - feel free to ignore it\n\nIf this thread gets a lot of responses, I'd be willing to do a rough statistical analysis of your experiences. This will not be a representative scientific evaluation, but given my scientific background it might be an exciting cross-sectional evaluation of r/ADHD for this moment in time. \n\nDisclaimer 1: Since I also have ADHD and am obviously hyperfixating on this post for hours now, there is a possibility that i will never actually do the evaluation in the end. Please dont hate me. If you want to do the evaluation instead - go for it!\n\nDisclaimer 2: Since I have not yet reached the maximum dose (getting close), have not yet discontinued the drug, and thus do not meet my own selection criteria, I will not share my personal experience with the drug for now.\n\n**Please do not share any personal information that could, in the worst case, lead to a possible link to your identity.** I will put some follow up questions in `inline code` that I would find interesting, you do not have to answer those :)\n\n*These questions are primarily directed to individuals who were at least initially disappointed with the effects of Vyvanse/Elvanse, experienced no or no desired effect from the drug, or perhaps had to discontinue it due to side effects.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Have any of you taken Elvanse/Vyvanse for an extended period time^(1) and experienced no or very little effect, even when increasing the dose^(2)?   \n`Which titration steps did you tried? For how long in each case? How long did you try to take Elvanse/Vyvanse and at what dose did you stop? If you stopped taking it before you increased the dose to the maximum recommended daily dose of 70 mg - why?`\n* Are you a responder to Elvanse/Vyvanse but didn't like the effect?   \n`At what dose and for how long did you experience the effects of Elvanse/Vyvanse? Why did you not like it or why was it disappointing? What effect would you have preferred instead?`\n* Had you suddenly felt effect with the recommended max daily dose of 70mg? Did this then magically stay or disappear like a \"honeymoon phase\"?  \n`If you felt an effect only at a high dose - was it as you would have preferred it? Did you have to take a higher dose than the maximum recommended daily dose of 70 mg? Are you still taking it, or have you stopped taking Elvanse/Vyvanse?`\n* Were you non-responder to Elvanse/Vyvanse? Did you experience side effects?  \n`How long and at what dosage did you experience side effects? In case you have not answered this question yet: How long and up to what dosage did you try taking Elvanse/Vyvanse?`\n* And the most important question - **did you find a medication that actually helped you**?^(3) You don't have to share the drug name and your dosage!   \n`How many medications did you have to try before you found the one that helped you best? How much time did it take you? Is the effect of this medicine now what you expected it to be? If not - what are the differences?`\n* Feel free do add any information you think might help any (future) lurker of this post, but also any data for the (probably-not-gonna-happen-anyway) evaluation. \n\n# Footnotes\n\n^(1) There are several posts complaining about Elvanse/Vyvanse not working after a few days with the smallest dose. I can absolutely understand that and it is also very frustrating to read many posts where people share their experiences how they feel better right away with the first pill and can see the world like through new eyes - and I am sooooooo happy for them!!!! But I would like to collect here especially experiences of people who have given the drug a fair chance, who tried it for several months, adjusted the dose ineffectively, maybe up to the max recommended daily dose with the consultation with the doctor and either had no (satisfactory) improvement or even had to stop because of side effects. \n\n^(2) I know we are all very impatient and just want to get better as soon as possible, but please, regardless of what you read in this thread, **do not change your dose on your own without consulting your doctor!** Also, **this is not medical advice!** Our brain chemistry is so damn different and unique from each other. Especially with this type of medication, a drug that helped someone here may not help you, and on the other hand, a medication that some people have had bad experiences with may change your life! Please talk to your doctor. \n\n^(3) Whenever you read this post, note that the number of responses to this question is very influenced by the so-called \"survivorship bias\". I.e. many people who have found a drug that helps them satisfactorily will most likely sooner or later stop actively following this subreddit and thus not respond in this thread. This is a bummer, but if you think about it, it is good news - they have found a drug that helps them. So we'll most likely figure it out as well :-).",

But once school ended and work began the struggles hit me like a tidal wave. Middle School teacher, freelancer, now in tech. I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t get on top of things. Frequently told my wife, “I just don’t think I was built to be an adult.” Led to a lot of internal turmoil.\n\nGot into therapy over a year ago. Finally built up the courage to ask to get tested. Results came back as a moderate attention disorder. Got prescribed focalin and just took my first pill 9 minutes ago. No idea what this journey will be like. Equal parts nervous and excited.\n\nDo people take focalin everyday? Do you take the weekends off? Is there a diet plan that works for you?\n\nI’ve never taken a prescription drug like this so it’s all new to me. Appreciate any advice I can get.\n\nThanks!",

They slowly increased my dosage to 18mg to 36mg to 54mg. I didn’t have any issues with acid reflux on 18mg or 36mg, but they weren’t working very effectively. I ran out of my medication (supply issues) and went without my medication for around two weeks. I finally got my medication and while the 54mg has been a world of a difference for me, I have been experiencing very unpleasant acid reflux and annoying heartburn. I’m just wondering if this is normal? Is it because my body has to adjust to the medication again? \n\nI have taken it on an empty stomach. I have ate before I took it and then after I took it, but nothing is really helping. It’s difficult for me to eat lunch or snacks as food is not at all appealing. Any suggestions? Thank you so much in advance.",

I had multiple panic attacks during several weeks. Started taking Sertraline but I had a really bad reaction, so they replaced it for Lexapro (10mg), which is working correctly now. Then I got tested for ADHD and got on Strattera, initially 40mg, without issues. A week ago I got my dose of Strattera increased to 60mg and I start suffering the same anxiety I got when I first got the breakdown. Not sure if this is common or expected when increasing the dose like this, will try to reach to my doctor but wanted to get some opinions about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help and insights!",

I don’t know what to do- I seek help for my drinking but sometimes taking vyvanse makes me want to drink even more by the end of the day. I feel lost. I wish I could stick to taking my medication normally but it feels impossible- I feel like I can’t regulate my life properly. I’m feeling very sad and scared. I have been to rehab, seen many psychs and still do about my drinking- I know vyvanse is the solution right now to being a functional human but when I see the pill next to my bed in the morning it is so hard to put it in mouth because I know it means I’ll have to be awake with my mind.

My biggest difficulties were memory (what the homework was, or things other than what I hyper focused on) organization (my desk was always a mess and sometimes I couldn’t find worksheets I needed) and focus (singing or humming  as I daydreamed).\n\nIn particular, my third and fourth grade teacher (same person) made things miserable for me.\n\nI would always forget to write my name on my paper. Not on purpose, of course. My teacher’s policy was that if you forgot your name on your paper, you had to stay behind during recess and write your name ten times on a piece of paper before you left for recess. This increased each time. (10 times the first time, 20 the second time, and so on.) I would send entire recesses just sitting in the classroom writing my name over and over on a piece of paper.\n\nShe also had a homework policy. Homework was especially difficult for me because I would forget to do it, or forget to bring it home, or lose the paper, etc. I was also a child of a single mother who didn’t really have the time to keep track of my homework, and she believed me if I said I had none. My teacher’s policy was that if you didn’t miss more than X amount of homework over some period of time, you would get to participate in a move day and pot luck where everyone brought food, had fun, and watched a movie. Those who didn’t had to sit in the hall and do work. I didn’t get to participate in a single one.\n\n\nI don’t remember complaining back then, but thinking back I feel like this was really cruel.",

I fell into a really low mood period that lasted really long, like 4 months or so and I felt like I need to do something. Even though I think I have had ADHD for years, all of the people around me are just telling me I'm lazy and unorganized. I also had these low-mood periods for years but somehow they always lasted shorter and I knew how to get out.\n\nHowever, after taking L-Tyrosine for the first time I started feeling calmer like my brain decreased looking for things to do all around (probably looking for dopamine). I managed to do concentrated work for a couple of days in a row. Before I had a really hard time starting the work, I'd just endlessly scroll through buy&amp;sell websites, Reddit, wandering in my mind, etc. Not to mention I prolonged my college studies for years, and now I feel like I'm capable of finishing it.\n\nAnd I started hearing the lyrics of the songs, somehow I never could hear the lyrics before, only the beat and I could never remember the lyrics. \n\nAlso, I have that 'you need to stay calm and finish this thing' thought in my mind while doing things which wasn't the case earlier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure if its a placebo or if something happened but I feel better for the first time in a while.\n\nNow I'm thinking if I need to add L-Theanine to my routine, not sure if it will make something better, or to wait for some time before doing that? I don't want to ruin how I feel right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake care my friends, we can do it :)",

        "text": "Question related to a previous one I posted. Is it a red flag to call around pharmacies to see which have you meds in stock? For example, I have been going to once pharmacy because they're the only ones that have had it in stock. It is $90 for 30 days, while at various other pharmacies it would be $30-40 if they had it in stock. \n\nIs it acceptable to call places beforehand to see if the cheaper pharmacies have it in stock? I have no idea how this system works. I have various other prescriptions &amp; get all but one at the same pharmacy I have been getting my stimulants at -- I used to get my previous non-stim ADHD med at one pharmacy so I'd also get hydroxyzine there. I switched to a stimulant &amp; that pharmacy doesn't have it in stock ever, but I still get hydroxyzine there, if that makes sense.\n\nI understand in a time without shortage issues that hopping around would raise red flags...but I know about the current state of things. My prescriber agreed when I said I could call around places &amp; see where it is in stock, so I assume it isn't an issue?",

I've done lots of research and do relate to a lot of the symptoms but its gotten to the point where everytime i do something that I know from research could be adhd my brain just goes \"Thats probably adhd\", and its so distracting. Not to mention my brain is just constantly going and I'm always imagining conversations with people in my head and a lot of them are revolving around adhd. Like me talking about my symptoms, me telling people that my therapist told me she's sure I had adhd e.t.c. I also feel like my thoughts have so many layers to them like I have a song playing in my head, im noticing stuff around me, thinking about what i'm going to do and on top of that i'm subconsciously being like \"this could be adhd\". I just feel like i think about how i might have adhd too much for me to actually have it.\n\nI feel like i relate so much to adhd and can connect it to so much in my childhood but i'm just scared that im somehow making all of this up and forcing myself to act this way and think this way to feel valid.\n\nSo I guess im just wondering if anyone can relate to this. Idk maybe I'm crazy it is currently 11pm and I can't sleep because my brains a bitch lmaooooo",

It's really hard to concentrate in class and the lack of drive doesn't help. I'm struggling to make basic decisions because it feels like I just don't have the mental capacity to do something basic. I dont want to meet up with friends because i just dont have the energy. A few friends have noticed I'm acting differently. My hands are shaking more and I've started randomly dropping things maybe once or twice a day. \n\n\nFeel like an absolute wreck of myself who's barely functioning and just trying to drag my corpse to the finish line at this point. Currently completely unsupported because I'm waiting for help so it's all on me to finish this stupid work...if I can...\n\n\nThe worst thing is these assignments are part of a series. The highest grade is distinction, the lowest is pass. I need to get 3 distinctions for each of the 3 assignments (the 4th one is almost completely done) to achieve a distinction over all. Got 2 distinctions and a pass? That's a pass for the whole unit because fuck you. Those 2 distinctions are wasted because of the 1 pass. I need the distinctions because my school is crap at communicating and I don't know when the exam results come back or what I've got. I need the high points from the assignments to cover up the exams to try and get into degree level education. \n\n\nAnd I don't know if I even have an assessment appointment, which probably won't be this month and maybe not next month either.

However I feel like I keep seeing so much conflicting information re what the best ways to make Elvanse work the best??   \nI used to take concerta and eating before the meds (esp protein) made a HUGE difference, is this the same with Elvanse? Or can I take it on a totally empty stomach? Also, as expected I'm not feeling very hungry during the day and a few times have got to 4/5pm and realised I've not eaten since breakfast. I'm trying to work in this by bringing cereal bars and high cal wraps etc to work but I guess I'm wondering how important it is to eat throughout the day in terms of the meds working? If I only manage my breakfast in the morning and then a cereal bar + fruit at lunch would this be bad for the meds specifically?   \nI'm also drinking on e cup of coffee approx 1.5-2hours after taking my meds each morning and then sometimes one again at 3/4pm and I think it's going fine, def doesn't seem to be having a negative impact - but am i hindering reaching the full potential? Is it better if i cut out caffeine entirely?   \nLast thing !! The SWEATING! I am sweating soo much more than usual, not even whilst exercising or walking somewhere but literally just from lying in bed it's bizarre. It's not the end of the world as I can just wear darker colours etc but if anyone did have any tips for how to lessen this that would be sooo appreciated !   \n\n\nThanks SO much in advance x",

But, it might have been one of those times when I thought doing something 4ather than actually doing it (like the many times I reply to a message in my head but not irl). I have tried to search for it looking at many of the recent posts, but I can't seem to find it.\n\nThe post I'm looking for had over 10 alternatives / options for people to consider with their doctor rather than Adderall/ritalin and vyvanse. I wonder if any of you are able to help link/direct me to this post as it would be a huge help. I'm sure some of you saved it like I thought I did.\n\nPlease, thank you and take care all!",

These are anxiety and sleep problems.\n\nFirst of all, the anxiety. I find this creeps in more and more as I take the medication for several days. On vyvanse my mind can't... stop? I guess. Or at least I find it very very difficult to hit pause on my mind when I'm taking this medication. I've always had issues with overthinking and its turbocharged when vyvanse is in my system. Sometimes that can be positive and allow me to get more things done, and stay on the ball. Other times it leads me down a depressive spiral of negative thinking.\n\nThe consequence of not being able to stop I think is that I end up really struggling to get to sleep at night. My body is exhausted, while my mind is like a V8 engine that wants to go, go, go. In the end I'm just not getting the 8 hours of sleep I need to function and I have a horrible burnout where I get super depressed and have to come off the medication for a few days.\n\nTried a few things with my dr like a lower dose, and to be honest that just left me feeling unmedicated. So I kind of just picked carrying on this unfortunate pattern as its the lesser of two evils when I know how bad I get unmedicated for long periods of time (I literally have no motivation to do anything)\n\nI don't really like the ups and downs, and I want more consistent results with the medication. If you have had similar problems and found a solution, I'd appreciate any tips.\n\nThanks",

I spent hours and hours on doing simple things but will eventually give up when I find it hard, it’s really draining. I don’t even comprehend what I am reading.

This has been a huge hindrance in my life because I can’t even do simple things like normal people do. It really feels like I’m different from the rest because of how effortlessly they do things. I am becoming more anxious day by day and I don’t know what to do. I will be seeing a psychiatrist soon but it seems that I can’t explain to them what is going on with me.

        "text": "Executive function underpins almost all of our lives, and ADHD degrades it. \n\nRelationships - be they romantic, friendships, colleagues or ... anything else really, usually have some implicit rules to them\\*. Expectations of mutual conduct. \n\nAnd your default behaviours are incompatible with some of those expectations.\n\nOther people will find the 'normal you' to be neglectful or disrespectful. Even people with ADHD, and even people who are understanding. \n\nThat doesn't change their feelings of being hurt or disrespected.\n\nThis is where the phrase \"ADHD is a reason not an excuse\" really comes in. \n\nBecause neither of you are really 'at fault' here. You're doing what comes naturally. You've not intended to hurt someone. But at the same time, that's been the result, and it's not their fault they find it hurtful. \n\nThere's really only two ways that we can deal with this:\n\n- Masking. In which we hide our 'normal self' behind a persona, that's ... not quite as weird. \n\n- Make new rules. \"House rule\" the relationship to one that works for both people. \n\nMasking works well enough for the workplace, or any group of people you're ok with 'just' interacting with. But masking is tiring, so you will likely find _that_ sort of socialising runs your batteries down. And you can't really get to know someone if you're hiding who you are. A friend you can't relax around isn't really a friend at all. \n\nSo that means making new rules for any relationship that matters to you. Acknowledge that your 'defaults' suck, and that you need to reforge the relationship based on 'rules' and 'expectations' that work for you both. \n\nThat will be easier if you both understand how and why your brain does what it does. It's _reasonable_ to expect that level of understanding from a friend or romantic partner. \n\nAnd it's _reasonable_ to discuss ways that you can make sure that the needs of both parties are fulfilled. \n\nBuild your coping strategies into your relationship, and let them become part of something that grows into something positive, supportive and wholesome. \n\nSome of these will be inanely simple. Like for example - my partner doesn't say 'remember to....' any more, because we _both_ know that ain't going to happen. Instead she says 'set a reminder to...'. And that simple rephrasing? That's enough, because I can _immediately_ set a reminder, and then I won't forget to do the thing. \n\nBut also be aware that you are prone to bad focus control. It's very easy to be unintentionally neglectful as a result. \n\nSo figure out ways to avoid it, because this person _matters_. \n\nI have reminders in my phone, to ensure it's not been too long since I paid attention to my partner. That sounds really strange to anyone who doesn't have ADHD, but ... I know I _will_ forget, and I cannot trust my brain to be romantic automatically. And she's worth more than that. She's very kind and understanding of my ADHD, and does forgive me generally when I do forget things. But I don't want her to _have_ to forgive. I want her to be reminded regularly and reliably that she's important to me, and that I do care for her and want her in my life. So I find a way to do that. For me, that's reminders.\n\nAnd you can do things like tell them explicitly that you might need reminding, and if they do that, you'll appreciate it and recognise it for the love and compassion that it is. Not ever 'nagging'. \n\nMaybe you can ask your partner to 'initiate' when they feel they want some attention? There's all sorts of weird hang ups about asking for attention when you want it, and it's a complex mess of reasons behind it. \n\nBut the one that's probably quite important here is that no one likes to feel rejected, and if you're in an ADHD obsession, you're \"busy\" and giving no signs off that you'll be receptive. So maybe recognise that too, and tell them that. Promise them that you will always 'pay them attention' when they ask in some fashion. \n\nAnd if you do let someone in - let them become part of your coping strategies - make sure you pay attention to the gift that is. A person being kind and supportive of your needs, by doing something for you out of love is a wonderful thing. Never take that for granted. Recognise it for what it is, and let them know you _appreciate_ it. Pull your own weight in this relationship. You can do that in other ways. \n\nIf your partner is 'working' as your PA, because they're just plain better at it, that frees you up to 'work' for them doing something else that _you_ are better at. As a team, you are better than as an individual. That's the most magical of relationships, and one that's worthy of cherishing. And definitely never taking for granted. \n\nThere are many ways to say 'I love you'. There's many forms of love. There's the kind that's the romantic love between partners, but there's also the kind of filial love between friends. But when someone does say \"I love you\" in words or in what they do the correct response is never \"I deserve it, now gimme more\". \n\nThat goes for all relationships really - you can make new 'house rules'. You _should_ make new 'house rules' as part of your necessary ADHD coping strategies. \n\n\\* Sometimes children don't yet, and this may be why people with ADHD actually get along with children pretty well.",

        "text": "I was recently diagnosed at 40. I was so fortunate that I was able to not only graduate high school a year early but also get a compsci degree with honors in my late 20s. I was only just recently diagnosed at 40. I always knew something was off. I guess I had thought that my father could have been diagnosed as a child with ADD with hyperactivity, ADHD, etc.\n\nThrough my 30s I've continued to suffer very damaging effects of the disorder while never being able to understand what I was going through. I was seeing doctor after doctor trying to convey my symptoms all while unknowingly suffering the memory issues we all seem to have. I was so bad and unaware that I couldn't realize I was constantly suffering memory issues. I had created certain systems to mitigate the issues of losing things. Always putting keys in the same spot, things like that.\n\nI had a girlfriend who was ADHD for about three years in my late 30s who I continually asked for help. I was suffering extreme mental fatigue, (forgive me as I don't mean to offend) mental deficiency (as I described it), a lot of days I wasn't able to even get out of bed, unable to properly clean and organize my apartment. Many times I had lost control of my anger and lashed out at friends and relatives knowing it was wrong but also knowing I was totally at odds with my inability to control myself and my reactions. I began to isolate myself at all costs as I couldn't trust myself and knew how to act better and also that I wanted to. Things got really dark for me. I was suffering with a lot of dysfunction to the point I could not understand.\n\nLooking back, I have certainly had ADHD symptoms all of my life. I was profoundly unaware and unable to totally understand what was happening. I am still extremely ashamed by myself and my actions. I couldn't get any understanding or help from mental health clinicians who stated there isn't a condition with anything I've described above. I said \"I feel narcoleptic. I'm doing things I don't agree with and feel I can't control. I want to change and do better but I am not able to.\"\n\nWhen finally diagnosed around my 40th birthday my heart sank. I realized that the condition certainly has these implications but is very disregarded and the most damaging aspects for adults are rarely known by those with early diagnosed, undiagnosed, also neurotypicals.\n\n I'm sure my brother was ADHD but had much more trouble with behavior than I did and didn't achieve nearly as much in life. Sadly he passed about six years ago due to drug abuse (I believe he had the same emotional dysregulation I dealt with along with severe RSD). I had only began to get these symptoms of emotional dysregulation and RSD in my late 20s along with behavior control issues.\n\nWhy do I feel I can't even tell someone who was diagnosed in childhood I have ADHD and it has caused a lot of damage in my life and also my family members lives? Am I totally wrong feeling like I'm not only being gaslighted by people who were more fortunate to be diagnosed earlier in life but being told I'm somehow causing them damage? \n\nMany early diagnosed with ADHD seem to not have suffered the behavior problems in adulthood or the emotional dysregulation as severely. I've simply been making every attempt to lead a better and more constructive life for myself and to understand why my family is incredibly dysfunctional and why my brother passed away. I'm just trying to find my truth and get some understanding. I get everyone had different experiences. Why are things like this and why does everyone seem to discriminate against each other? I get it sucks that people who aren't suffering as much don't appreciate behavior control is part of the condition but at the same time I think it's damaging that late diagnosed adults with ADHD suffer from a lot of damage due to these symptoms getting worse over time.\n\nI'm still haunted by my past, it's not been that bad but I did a lot of impulsive things that I just don't agree with along with not really understanding what is and isn't abuse. I understand physical abuse but I didn't understand verbal abuse.\n\nAm I wrong to think that undiagnosed ADHD has some potentially negative societal implications?\n\nAm I wrong to think my family is almost all ADHD but in a really bad/damaging way?\n\nAm I wrong to think it would be good to allow people with behavioral problems and consequences to heal and be more productive instead of treated like myself to the point of criminalization? (Yes there should be consequences for irresponsible actions but people who get better would certainly help everyone.)\n\nAm I wrong to think that ADHD is a problem when undiagnosed and it should have more acceptance and also not treating youth for it is incredibly harmful and abusive?\n\nHonestly I just want there to be less stigma, more acceptance and understanding. More healing and positivity. I apologize because I know the vast majority of people with ADHD don't have the same problems and are generally good people who have a great capacity for living lives that don't victimizes others.",

        "text": "TL;DR: Prescribed Dexedrine seems to not have a function anymore. Experiencing a big crash on my regular prescribed medications  \n\n\nDoes anyone notice a difference in your regular prescribed ADHD medication?\n\nWell, for me, then I can tell you that I have felt some big noticeable change in my regular dextroamphetamine «Dexedrine» medication the last month.   \nMy experience with my ADHD medication, is after I have been using the same medication from the same brand and pharmacy as usual, so I have been wondering little if I am paranoid about my experience and thoughts,  or whether it is the right case.   \nLet's just say it, that I have been very carefully to conclude that this is the right case. I have used the time to think and feel more about my experience, before I write this post.  \nMy age was 30+ years when I got the ADHD diagnosis and when I started with medication.  \nThe medication therapy have been a big life changer for me, where the medication have reduced my ADHD symptoms and increased my function in daily life.  \n\n\nMore about my bad experience, is that my medication with dextroamphetamine have stopped working after I bought a new supply and started with it.  \nI got so many bad side effects I didn't even know about, so I started to do some research about all my side effects.  \nMy research guided me into Dexedrine crash, where they also talked about \"Cold Turkey dextroamphetamine\".  («Cold Turkey Dexedrine»  -  When someone is dependent upon Dexedrine and they suddenly stop using it or quit the medication)   \nI didn't even know about the crash before I felt and red about it.  \nBut all my symptoms is related to Cold Turkey Dexedrine, even when I have been using my medication as usal.  \nSo it seems that my experience is related to that my medication isn't working anymore, and I am ending up with a serious crash with heavy side effects.\n\nA friend of me gave me some other Dexedrine tablets from his own prescribed medicine(same brand), and my experience with them is that all my negative side effects disappeared, and I am able to feel normal again. (My friends prescribed medication have been bought from the pharmacy for over 6 months ago)  \nI have tested my medicine back and forth between my own medicine and my friends medicine 3 times of a period of over 3 weeks, and the result is the same every time. He also tested my medicine, and he noticed a difference and explained it as he felt it didn't work as it should. (Three friends have tested it, and everyone of them explained the same)   \nAll of them are using the same medication from the same brand, but from a earlier bought supply.  \nI have also bought all my prescribed meds from three different pharmacies and testet all of them. All of them ended with the same results.  \n\n\nSo what is the real case?   \nDoes anyone else feel related to my experience with your own medication?  \nThis is a serious issue if the supply factors have changed the recipe/formulas on the medication to a formula which doesn't even work on people.  \nCold Turkey with a stimulant medication can have a big negative effect on people, and if this is the real case and a bigger issue around the world, people will struggle like hell\n\nIf you have any experience with this, or heard about anyone with an experience in a way that can be related to my experience, please share your/their story.\n\nYes, I have had in my mind of the development of intolerance to the medicine, and I can make it clear that this isn't the case for me.  \nI also know that there's a big shortage on ADHD medication around the world, and have been wondering if my experience can be related to this.\n\nYes, I will take this with my doctor, but I felt that I needed more experience before I start the process with them. It doesn't feel cool to go to professional doctors and tell them that my medication from the same brand isn't working any more. They will probably think that I am paranoid first, if they haven't heard about this before.\n\nI am based in a country in EU, where the pharmacies have strict rules for being able to operate as a legally licensed pharmacy   \n\n\nIf you wonder, then this has been my side effects with the crash i felt:\n\n\\-Struggle to function  \n\\-Extreme fatigue - Feel extremely heavy/empty in my body  \n\\-Struggle to think clearly  \n\\-Low working memory  \n\\-Low energy level  \n\\-Shortness of breath  \n\\-Higher blood pressure  \n\\-Rapid heart rate  \n\\-Sleep disturbances - Wasn't able to sleep for over 2 days (never happen to me before)  \n\\-Increased anxiety  \n\\-Lethargy  \n\\-Irritability  \n\\-Agitation  \n\\-Depression  \n\\-Extreme dryness in mouth  \n\\-\"Throw up\" feeling all the time - I even wasn't able to brush my tongue, because I got throw up reflex so quick when I touched my tongue with the brush  \n\\-Low appetite",

When presented with a conflict, my mind races on 1 way for it to go right and 100 ways for it to go wrong. Let's say that usually leads to anxiety. Also, when while speaking with someone presenting a conflict, my mind starts racing on the above, keeping me from fully listening to the problem and ultimately misreading the situation in the first place.\n\nHow have you handled this?",

Unpleasant and unhelpful to say the least, and I'm finding out after the fact that that practice was notorious in my area for being rude and unhelpful to paitents, not only the providers but particularly the office staff. So I moved on, got a new referral from my insurance, finally got in with a new psychiatrists office that's much more reputable and part of a larger university based practice. \n\nWhen I first talked to my new provider he let me know that he needed the evaluation records from my old psych. No problem, right? Wrong! It took me over 2 dozen phone calls, 8 weeks, 4 polite emails and finally one very bitchy and angry email with a link to the California Board's website regarding a patient's legal rights to accessing their records, they finally sent it over to my new provider-- after lying to me in writing about sending it 6 weeks prior! I know this because my new provider's very sweet and helpful office staff let me know that the date they received the records was the day after I threatened to report them. All this time I've been on the practice's wait list for a new evaluation, because before I was told my paitents rights, I was quite sure I was SOL and I seriously needed to get back on the medication that worked for me.\n\n\nSo, my records FINALLY being sent, I schedule another appointment with my psych to talk things over get my Wellbutrin refilled in the meantime. Well, about an hour later, the office coordinator calls to let me know there's been a cancellation and that she could get me in (tomorrow!!) for a new evaluation.\n\n\nI'm going in tomorrow to do it, of course, my line of thinking is that an evaluation from them AND another practitioner is probably going to make it easier to grt back on the stimulant medical that helped me, if nothing else it will reassure them that I'm not full of shit and drug seeking and that my ADHD really does affect my lifr greatly. I feel fortunate that I even have the resources to see a specialist, but god damn what a nightmare this has been.",

What they don't know is that I can't help dragging the tasks on and on for months until the I finally have a mental breakdown forcing myself to squeeze out whatever mediocre output I can manage all while wallowing in self loathing and guilt.

Yes I know I can excel, but at what cost? \n\nSo that leads me think, for those still considering a career path, what are some things we could do with minimal effort?

I gotta blame my HS for neglecting me and still humiliating me publicly for me under achieving in school\n\nI’m just so depressed and have no positive self image and I can’t escape my past. And I feel too incapable of working and living independently. I feel so inferior, like who tf can’t hold a no skill job without getting fired due to poor performance. I feel so terrible",
