So I made an app that lets you easily look up words in subtitles, games, and anywhere on your Mac's screen without switching apps","author":"a1exejka","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11pibxz\/as_a_nonnative_speaker_i_got_tired_of_googling\/","text":"\ud83d\udc4b Hi\u00a0[r\/Apple](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Apple\/).\n\nI am Aleksei, a computational linguist and indie-hacker. Last month, I released an app that lets you look up words anywhere on your Mac. It's called LookUpAnyApp.\n\nSee the app preview here: [https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/lookupanyapp\/id1667225994](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/lookupanyapp\/id1667225994)\n\nIt will help you get off the language learning plateau by consuming content you enjoy - movies, games, books, TV shows, memes on Reddit, etc. The app lets you learn and improve a language naturally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How it works\n\nJust place the cursor on a word and press the keyboard shortcut (Shift + Command + D by default). The definition of the word will appear in a pop-up window.\n\nLookUpAnyApp uses Vision AI to recognize text and MacOS dictionaries to retrieve word definitions and translations. You can choose which dictionaries you prefer and the order in which definitions appear.\n\nWord lookup is completed in less than a quarter of a second. Then, when idle, the app uses zero CPU and zero power. So you can leave it running in the background without worrying about it draining your battery.\n\nIt currently supports eight languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Ukrainian.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# But wait, Mac already has a \u201clook up words\u201d feature\n\nYes, it does. But the built-in \"look up words\" feature is limited and only works with selectable text.\n\nLookUpAnyApp, on the other hand, allows you to look up words anywhere on the screen: in subtitles, full-screen games, meme images, even in the menu bar and deck. There are no more limitations.\n\nAnd the app does more than just look up words:\n\n* It makes your Mac understand compound verbs and nouns like \"break out\" and \"bus stop\".\n* It saves the words you look up so you can review them, learn them, and export them to language learning apps like Anki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Pricing\n\n\u2705 It\u2019s free up to 50 lookups per day. No ads, no subscription, no data collection.\n\nIf you want more, you can upgrade to Pro. You get unlimited lookups and full access to all new features that will come in the future.\n\nPro costs $29.99. One-time purchase. Lifetime.\n\nThere is an early bird promo for the first 100 users. So you can upgrade to Pro for $19.99 instead of $29.99.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f Download: [https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/lookupanyapp\/id1667225994](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/lookupanyapp\/id1667225994)\n\nAny kind of suggestions and feedback are welcome.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678637609.0},{"title":"Apple\u2019s New Challenge: A Wave of Key Executives Leaving the Company","author":"Snoop8ball","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/newsletters\/2023-03-12\/why-are-so-many-apple-executives-leaving-who-are-successors-at-apple-aapl-lf5g7j9c","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678629038.0},{"title":"Video shows off 3D-printed iPhone 15 dummy units and tests compatibility with iPhone 14 cases","author":"OutlandishnessOk2452","url":"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2023\/03\/12\/iphone-15-dummy-units-video\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678640840.0},{"title":"'My watch warned me I had an undiagnosed heart condition'","author":"OutlandishnessOk2452","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-64901114","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678557719.0},{"title":"SATURN 3D - 3D game for Apple Watch","author":"ltchean","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11ptgz7\/saturn_3d_3d_game_for_apple_watch\/","text":"Asteroids in 3D - how long can your survive?\n\n[https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/saturn-3d-watch-game\/id1172692837](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/saturn-3d-watch-game\/id1172692837)","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1678663738.0},{"title":"New Breathing Exercise App","author":"steveV24","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11pgfd2\/new_breathing_exercise_app\/","text":"My new breathing exercise app is now approved and available!

If you decide to skip the solution, I would at least suggest to read \"Finding the root of the problem\" section, which may help you to find what's **really** preventing your MB good sleep.\n\n# TLDR\n\nTLDR; Follow this steps to fix your poor laptop sleep issues: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/HhFqXoi](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/HhFqXoi). If that doesn't immediately work, check the rest of the post for complementary data that may help. Lastly, make sure you learn the features you are disabling (essentially power nap), to make sure you can actually live without them.\n\n# Sources\n\nBut first, I must give credit to these two sources (feel free to check them directly, the solution is ultimately here):\n\n* [https:\/\/www.bravolt.com\/post\/why-won-t-my-computer-sleep](https:\/\/www.bravolt.com\/post\/why-won-t-my-computer-sleep) \\- This article is incredibly detailed and it was so clarifying.\n* [https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/252276065](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/252276065) \\- The final solution comes from here, so who actually deserves credit for this possible fix is the guy who posted here.\n\n# Mac settings (interface)\n\n\\- **Consider disabling Screen off**, as the mentioned reddit post suggests. It didn't make any difference to me but you may want to give it a try.\n\n\\- **Disable power nap (important)**. You may not find it exactly with this name, but more like \"Allow network access\" (in battery options).\n\n\\- Some people may suggest disabling bluetooth but Imagine spending +1.600\u20ac on a laptop that can't have its bluetooth on. So let's try to keep this as a last resource haha\n\n# Finding the root of the problem\n\nTo see what processes prevent your Mac from sleeping, open the Activity Monitor. Go to the top menu var, click \"View\" ->  \"columns\" -> mark \"Prevent sleep\". A new column will appear.\n\nSort all your processes by Prevent sleep and you'll see at the top the processes that may be doing so. In my case, it's WindowServer and powerd (so I already know I can't remove them, as they are required by the system).\n\nKnowing this can help you figure out the solution, in case the solution suggested here doesn't work.\n\nTo \"debug\" even further, do the following:\n\n1. Open your terminal (CMD + Spacebar -> Write \"terminal\").\n2. Type and enter \"sudo pmset -g\". You'll see at sleep something like \"sleep: 1 (sleep prevented by...)\"\n3. Type \"sudo pmset -g assertions\". Check the bottom of the result and you'll see the same process with an explanation of its job.\n\nTo verify that the power nap is what is messing with your laptop's sleep, type this in your terminal (without the dollar symbol):\n\n$ pmset -g log|grep -e \" Sleep  \" -e \" Wake  \"\n\nYou may or may not get a log with all the nasty stuff your laptop does while you sleep. If it seems like it's constantly doing stuff, that could be the source of the problem. And that was actually my problem.\n\n# Mac settings (files)\n\nIf you've ran \"sudo pmset -g\", you might have got something like this: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Magr9ik](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/Magr9ik)\n\nIf you've ran \"pmset -g log|grep -e \" Sleep  \" -e \" Wake  \"\", you may have noticed that Maintenance sleep may be screwing with your laptop's sleep, and you may notice a TCPKeepAlive=Active. See how a messed up log looks like: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ZRt7Rgc](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ZRt7Rgc)\n\nYou'll want to completely disable power nap (the interface toggle mentioned before **may not be enough**) and that the tcp keep alive. Open your terminal and launch the following commands (without the dollar symbol):\n\n$ sudo pmset -a tcpkeepalive 0\n\n$ sudo pmset -a powernap 0\n\nTo double check that the changes had effect, launch:\n\n$ pmset -g\n\nAnd check that powernap and tcpkeepalive variables are at 0.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: please do see u\/JollyRoger8X comment, it would be a good idea to first learn what the power nap is and does before disabling it for good. Just so you know what feature you will be missing.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678431815.0},{"title":"Apple Music Classical launches March 28th.

I live in the EU and have bought an Macbook Pro 16\" 2021 unit and purchased Applecare+.\n\nIn January 2023 I accidentally made a dent in the middle of my screen due to a HDMI-cable swung into the screen. I called AppleCare and had to pay $99,- for the repair under Applecare+ and UPS picked up my device and sent it to their Repair Centre in Czech.\n\nIt came back with a screen that had an obvious scratch on the hinge and a small scratch next to the camera. Even worse I noticed a very small dent in front of my topcase, like something hit the edge of the front of the topcase. Immediately I called Apple and reporting my observations and told them I had pictures before I packed the device. The first Senior Advisor (SA) told me he doesn't know what to do in this case, cause it is considered 'cosmetic damage'. I told him this 'cosmetic damage' was not done by myself, but your repair depot in Czech. A week went by and due to circumstances I had another Senior Advisor who, without hesitating, said this is not the quality you should expect and we will fix this for you. As he said the damage to the topcase should not happen as they have their repair setup this should not happen and the screen replacement should be a unit that is in perfect condition no (minor) scratches nothing.\n\nSecond repair was setup and returned. Topcase was not fixed, but the screen was replaced however this one has a quite obvious dent in the left corner. I was transferred to Customer Relations to apply for a refund or replacement, both which were denied by the CR's manager saying that I could not proof it was done by them (however I have made detailed pictures of the unit everytime I sent the the device tor repair).\n\nThe customer relations said he would make a 'special repair code' so the Senior Advisor can make another repair which overrules certain conditions to get this fixed. Both the screen and top case all were promised and guaranteed multiple times by phone.\n\nThird repair came back. Topcase was not fixed, however the screen was once again replaced. At first glance the screen looks perfect. Upon inspection with a flashlight, I could see a lot of 'dots' and '2 hairline scratches' all over the screen. All Senior Advisors and even an Apple Store emplyee told me this should not be the case no damage whatsoever should be present in the replacement screen.\n\nI was able to capture the 'dots\/microscratches\/hairline scratches' on camera in a certain angle with a flashlight on it. The Senior Advisors understand and agree that I am in my right, however Customer Relations tell me this is cosmetic damage and they do not repair cosmetic damage.\n\nI am 100% sure, even backed up by the Senior Advisors, that I should not receive a screen with microscratches, customer relations says otherwise.\n\nIs it true that Apple screen repairs contain microscratches and this is 'normal'? Obviously this is not the Apple and AppleCare+ experience I expected at all. I am fully aware that Apple does not repair cosmetic damage if I requested this under AppleCare+. However I have received three screens replacement that have \"cosmetic damage\" from Apple itsself.\n\nThis would basically be saying that if I sent in perfect condition device, they could just return it to my in scratched and dented state, claiming its just 'cosmetic damage' and could happen. (Which does not say in the terms anywhere).\n\nSummary:\n\n1. Three repairs, all three screen replacements had some sort of damage like(micro)scratches, hairline-scratches. My last and current screen has dots\/scratches\/micro scratches all over which I can see via flashlight or certain lightning conditions and angles.\n2. Talked to at least 3 Senior Advisors and an Apple Store Employee telling me the screens should have no damage and be in mint condition\n3. Customer Relations saying this is cosmetic damage, could happen and we not repair this. Which is totally opposite of what the Senior Advisors told me. NOTE: The replacements CONTAIN the damage, I sent in my device in perfect condition, apart from the reason I sent it in for.\n\nExtremely frustrated anyone have experience or know how about this situation?","upvote_ratio":0.52,"created_utc":1678486642.0},{"title":"Apple and Foxconn win labour reforms to advance Indian production plans","author":"NewMeNewWorld","url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/86bf4c20-e95a-4f8e-bd8d-b7bdee3bc3ba","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678427100.0},{"title":"Why release devices (HomePods) with silo-busting Thread\/Matter support, then kneecap android compatibility?","author":"fourchoicesnonegreat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11os4kd\/why_release_devices_homepods_with_silobusting\/","text":"Maybe Beats should make a cross compatible speaker thats also a home hub, if the Apple brand is ideologically opposed use parity on android devices","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678561449.0},{"title":"Apple is working on their StreetView-like functionality for their customers in Mexico.","author":"ElectroclassicM","url":"https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/imagecollection\/locations\/mx","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678406652.0},{"title":"Apple invites Ted Lasso fans to \u201cbelieve\u201d with new Today at Apple session","author":"WhizCanadian","url":"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ca\/newsroom\/2023\/03\/apple-invites-ted-lasso-fans-to-believe-with-new-today-at-apple-session\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678424205.0},{"title":"Expanded App Store Price Points Now Available for All App Purchases","author":"WhizCanadian","url":"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/03\/09\/app-store-pricing-updates-all-apps\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678414906.0},{"title":"Apple Working on Under-Display Touch ID, Could Debut in First All-Screen iPhone","author":"chrisdh79","url":"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/03\/09\/apple-researching-under-screen-touch-id\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678369698.0},{"title":"Daily Advice Thread - March 10, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11nm1d9\/daily_advice_thread_march_10_2023\/","text":"Welcome to the Daily Advice Thread for \/r\/Apple.

It\u2019s hard to describe without someone experiencing it, but a truly good AR headset has the same \u201cA-ha!\u201d feel to it that the original iPhone did.\n\nHere are my thoughts fully written:\n\nEvery time an article is posted about Apple\u2019s rumoured, upcoming mixed reality headset, I find that the top comments tend to be people complaining that the device doesn\u2019t make sense as there\u2019s no obvious application for it. This often then countered with others insisting that whether we see it or not, Apple clearly must have a killer app for this headset, otherwise why does it exist?\n\nI personally leaned very slightly towards the camp of \u201cApple must have their reasons,\u201d with my own take being that Apple feels that AR glasses are their next big thing, but the headset is something they need to cut their teeth on before they can get there. That\u2019s how the rumours of what the headset is supposed to be could make any sense to me. \n\nThat is, until last night. \n\nYesterday I finally was able to pick up my PSVR 2 headset that I had ordered. If you have a PS5 and are interested in VR at all, I *highly* recommend picking one up. I have limited experiences with Vives and the previous PSVR, but this device has been an astounding experience so far for games. The games, however, were not what stuck with me from this experience. I\u2019ve used VR before, and the games were mostly a better version of that.\n\nNo, what stuck with me was, of all things, the set up process. The PSVR 2 has a pass through mode where it will replace whatever is displaying on the headset with the feed from the external cameras. \n\nThis effect is **incredible**. It\u2019s not noteworthy due to any visual fidelity. Quite the opposite, the picture is low resolution, grainy, and entirely black and white. The thing is, none of that matters. What Sony absolutely nailed was that, first, the image in pass through mode comes in at what I assume is 120 fps. There is no perceptible lag whatsoever between what I am seeing and what is happening outside of the cameras. \n\nThe second part to the equation is that the focal length of the cameras matches the focal length of my eyes, or is at least really close. Things look *correct.* My hand looks to be where my brain would expect it to be, and it looks natural without any odd distortion to it. \n\nThis is the first time that any kind of POV thing has looked good enough that my brain had no trouble accepting the input. Despite the low image quality, there was no dissonance to the experience at all. When I reach out to touch something in pass through mode, my hand makes contact exactly where I expect it to, exactly when I expect it to. It doesn\u2019t *feel* like looking at my hand through a camera, it just *feels* like looking at my hand. \n\nThe effect becomes downright exiting when digital elements are added. Whether dialogue boxes, or the play area mesh that the VR system will put out over your surroundings to figure out how best to avoid having you bump into stuff while playing, these things have a different quality to them than anything else I\u2019ve experienced in AR. \n\nAll of this brings me to the word I\u2019ve been focusing on since I set up my VR headset:\n\nTangible.\n\nIn the same way that this set up causes my brain to say, \u201cyes, that\u2019s your hand,\u201d \nI find myself naturally accepting the digital assets that are overlayed. \u201cYes, that\u2019s a mesh on the floor, yes that\u2019s a dialogue box.\u201d I don\u2019t get this effect at all with AR on my phone. Obviously I\u2019m not trying to imply that the AR elements feel indistinguishable from real ones, the effect isn\u2019t that good. It doesn\u2019t need to be though. What ends up happening is that the PSVR 2 set up crosses some threshold where the overlayed items feel distinctly tangible.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe without experiencing, but the closest comparison I can come up with is how different the original iPhone felt compared to the touch screens of the day. A lot of elements came together to make the iPhone work as well as it did. However, I would argue strongly that the single most important aspect to the iPhone, the thing that made it feel revolutionary, was its tangibility.\n\nModern smartphones are seen as necessary for a wide range of reasons and features. Certain apps, web browsing, the camera, messaging. Almost none of that was present in the original iPhone at its announcement though. Third party apps were absent, no one cared about the camera nearly as much. Steve Jobs even declared that the killer app was making phone calls. \n\nYet the iPhone was immediately an obviously superior way to interact with devices, and I\u2019d argue the element they got right was *tangibility.* With the capacitive touch screen, two things were possible that pressure sensitive touchscreens couldn\u2019t mimic in an effective manner. First, without the pressure detecting layer people could, in a way taken for granted today, touch the glass of the screen itself with very little gap between the finger and the actual pixels of the screen. Second, because the touch detection was happening at a much higher fidelity and rate, the device was able to both detect and react to touch input without delay. \n\nThe effect is tangibility. It *feels* like you are grabbing the list of music with your thumb. It *feels* like you are spreading out a picture to zoom in. It *feels* like you are activating keys on the keyboard. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI don\u2019t know that Apple has some killer feature or use case lined up for the headset, but I am less convinced now that they need to. Like with the original iPhone, I think this is an area where nailing the feel and the experience will lead to the killer apps, not the other way around. If Apple can replicate that feeling in the Apple Store, people will want this device. There are certain interactions that will simply be better with it, and new ones will come as the market matures. \n\nI\u2019m not saying the headset is destined to be as big as the iPhone or is guaranteed to be successful. There\u2019s no way to effectively predict that. What I do believe is that the headset may be more self justifying than people realize.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1678373753.0},{"title":"Are there any examples of Apps that have been removed from the Apple store that track users?without permission?","author":"Iyammagawd","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11n803l\/are_there_any_examples_of_apps_that_have_been\/","text":"There were some threats a few years ago that Apple would take down some apps to protect user privacy.

And now, with LLMs demonstrating the immense potential of AI, it\u2019s become clear that Siri can and should do more as a digital assistant. It\u2019s time for a major upgrade, and after spending some time with ChatGPT and BingAI, I believe the path forward is Siri on iMessage.\n\n**Siri on iMessage**\n\niMessage is the most natural way for Apple to introduce new conversational capabilities to Siri. With Siri integrated into iMessage, users would be able to chat with Siri directly within the app, enabling new capabilities.\n\n* **Search**: Simply have a conversation with Siri to search the web, research topics, read up on news, and gather information\n* **Embed Content**: Embed content directly within your Siri iMessage chat, such as photos, links, documents, etc. and have Siri provide insights, summaries, critiques or assistance\n* **Natural Language Photo Editing**: Share photos and use natural language to perform edits, such as removing objects, applying filters, or producing new variations of the image\n* **Natural Language Content Creation:** Ask Siri to create visuals using natural language input, such as images, graphs, flowcharts, etc.\n* **Natural Language iWork Collaboration:** Ask Siri to create spreadsheets, documents, or presentations using natural language and output the content as downloadable Numbers, Pages and Keynote files\n* **Message Insights:** Have Siri analyze other iMessage conversations and ask her to provide insights or assistance. For example, if a user receives an invitation and is not sure how to politely decline, they could prompt Siri with \u201cHelp me politely decline u\/Cindy\u2019s party invitation.\u201d\n* **Group Chats with Siri:** Invite Siri to a group chat with friends to provide information, schedule events, play games, tell jokes, etc.\n* **FaceTime Conference with Siri**: Coordinate FaceTime conference calls with Siri and have her participate on the call to provide call notes, insights, actionable items, calendar reminders, etc. During the call, invoke Siri to ask her to check your calendar availability or look up information. For example, if friends are discussing a new restaurant, they could ask Siri to look up the restaurant\u2019s menu or hours of operation.\n\nSiri has the potential to be a game-changer in the age of LLMs. By integrating Siri within iMessage, Apple could significantly enhance the functionality of its digital assistant and provide users with valuable insights, assistance, and convenience.

In general I\u2019m happy with the quality of the hardware. The software, however, seems to keep getting worse. Here are some of my current top issues - all on the latest stable OS releases (I don\u2019t run prerelease software on these devices): \n\n- Apple TV: twice in the last week I\u2019ve had to reboot the device by pulling the power cord. I\u2019ve had Apple TV devices since the second gen and never had a hang until now. This happened when I went to the task switcher to switch apps - the switcher view came up then the device stopped responding to all input. \n\n- Audio on HomePod. In the last couple of releases audio has gotten really unreliable with HomePod. I used a stereo pair attached to my Apple TV and use eARC. For no apparent reason, audio will just stop rendering on the HomePods. I have to reboot them. No amount of selecting them as the audio output or rebooting the Apple TV works. Sometimes it happens when switching from an audio-only podcast to video in a TV app. Sometimes it happens if I\u2019ve paused TV for more than 10 or 15 minutes - there\u2019s no audio on resume until I restart the HomePods. \n\n- Siri. I see lots of complaints, but some of my recent problems are with the basics. \u201cHey Siri pause\u201d works when playing media on Apple TV, but then just a minute later saying \u201cHey Siri, resume\u201d yields an error (\u201cSorry <name> I couldn\u2019t resume\u201d. If I used the Apple TV remote or my iPhone\u2019s AirPlay controls I can resume instantly with no issue. Only Siri can\u2019t resume for some reason. \n\n- I\u2019m also getting tired of Siri randomly saying \u201csorry, I couldn\u2019t skip this\u201d when I ask it to fast-forward 30 seconds in an audio podcast. Why? Why can\u2019t you skip it?  If I tap the jump forward button on the remote it works.  \n\n- Right now, nearly every day I have to restart a pair of HomePod minis because all of my Thread devices become unresponsive. Why?  This never happened before and I haven\u2019t added any new Thread devices - I\u2019ve had several for months and they worked but now HomePod keeps making them unresponsive. Worse, sometimes choosing \u201crestart HomePod\u201d in the Home app doesn\u2019t actually work and I have to cut power to the devices to reboot them. \n\n- Not to leave iPhone out, twice yesterday I had to reboot my iPhone. The only time I usually reboot is to install updates. Yesterday, the mic indicator icon was stuck on in the dynamic island and claimed that Apple TV remote was using it. It was not. After a reboot, no amount of pressing and holding the right button would bring up Siri so I had to reboot again. This was on an iPhone 14 Pro Max.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678066569.0},{"title":"Apple will reportedly launch an M3-equipped iMac later this year","author":"Mandelmus100","url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2023\/3\/5\/23625972\/apple-new-imac-launch-m3-chip","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678047536.0},{"title":"iPhone 15 Pro Front Glass Leak Reveals Ultra-Thin Bezels Around Display","author":"Mr__X__","url":"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/03\/05\/iphone-15-pro-front-glass-leak\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678036885.0},{"title":"Anyone else continually disappointed with their HomePod?","author":"HunkyMump","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11j7mfb\/anyone_else_continually_disappointed_with_their\/","text":"My HomePods or HomePod minis can never \u201cfind that song in your Apple Music library\u201d and it just ends up being a hassle.

So, I decided to try building my own.

It currently only supports portrait mode, I have some spicy ideas for landscape. [Here's what I'm planning to build](https:\/\/twitter.com\/selvarajashish\/status\/1630743819518967811?s=20). \n\nNot Evil Sudoku for iPad has all the features of the iPhone app, SwiftUI makes it really easy to deploy one codebase to both. But it still needed some additional work so that the UI wasn't wonky.\n\n## Pricing\n\nEveryone can play a sudoku puzzle every day for free.

Just thought I\u2019d explain my situation. \n\nI bought a 14\u201d MacBook Pro (2021). This is a $3000 (cdn after tax) machine marketed towards professionals. I\u2019ve been having issue after issue with this laptop.\n\nThe usb ports on the left side stopped working. The \u201clid angle sensor\u201d is borked (doesn\u2019t properly detect if it\u2019s failed).\n\nI use this thing for work. I\u2019m a web developer and the suite of software\/tools is very well honed in to maximize my workflow. I would of expected Apple being the size they are to have some temporary swap in program for professionals when getting repairs done (they certainly have the tech stack to pull it off) but they don\u2019t and lord know we as consumers always get shafted on the warranty side of the equation (ie: they is no recourse\/recompense for the time without said product you\u2019ve paid for and would expect to work, you\u2019re just supposed to put up with whatever time it takes for companies to repair the issue of their own making).\n\nThat\u2019s a rabbit hole that\u2019s a bit off topic, but it\u2019s hard not to feel like the house always wins. \n\nAnyway, now for the real issue. I brought my laptop in for repair. This has taken a phone call and 2 trips to the Apple Store to coordinate (since I couldn\u2019t just give my laptop up without timing it for workload and my first assumption they could swap it after testing was incorrect.\n\nA week later after the repair is done (and getting almost nothing done at work killing my mental health) I get my laptop back\u2026..\n\nExcept nothing as far as I can tell has been fixed. Usb ports still don\u2019t work, laptop still seems to die when the lid is closed faster than expected.\n\n\nAt this point,  I\u2019m getting really frustrated. \n\nI spend another month with this broken thing just cause I need it for work. Finally, I hit my last straw. The sound starts cutting out when I\u2019m doing a heavy machine learning task. \n\nI can\u2019t just run the clock out on my warranty so one more call and trip to the Apple Store (where they inspect\/confirm the issues still exist) and I\u2019m told I\u2019m due for another round of week long repairs. This time I refuse. I want a straight swap as my computer specific computer seems cursed with issues (plus I\u2019m just frustrated to have nothing accomplished after the first round).\n\nI\u2019m told I can call support and see what they say. I\u2019m polite . I\u2019m respectful. I explain. Support checks with a higher up and I\u2019m told:\n\u201cGood news. You qualify for a replacement laptop after 3 rounds of repairs\u201d\u2026.\n\nI say: I need to have my laptop fail 2 more times through no fault of my own before you \u2018ll just replace it?\n\nShe confirms.\n\nWTF Apple?","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678022743.0},{"title":"Daily Advice Thread - March 05, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11iufql\/daily_advice_thread_march_05_2023\/","text":"Welcome to the Daily Advice Thread for \/r\/Apple.

Indeed the MacBook was _listed_ as delivered by both Apple and FedEx (the courier) but it never arrived at my apartment. Looking at the FedEx proof of delivery, it turned out that **it was signed for by a complete stranger** with no affiliation with myself or the apartment!\n\nSo I contacted both Apple and FedEx, and at Apple\u2019s recommendation I filed a police report with the Baltimore Police Department. I called Apple again this morning in order to update them that I filed the report, and I was prepared them to give them the case number, but they said it was BPD that had to inform Apple, not me.\n\nSo then I called BPD asking if they\u2019d inform Apple, and they said no, and I will have to forward the police report to Apple myself. I then called Apple _again_ and this time they said it was completely out of their hands, and that it was now the responsibility of local law enforcement to resolve the case. But knowing BPD\u2026yeah good luck with that.\n\nSo now I'm $2000 in the hole and at this point the only thing I can think of that'll get me back that money is to call my credit card company to do a chargeback (or at least call Apple again to threaten one). I've seen that that's a way to get your Apple ID locked, but if that's the way a trillion-dollar corporation is willing to do with regards to their deliveries, perhaps it is worth it to be excommunicated from the walled garden.\n\nI hope that this post highlights these sorts of issues with Apple, given that I am not the only person who has faced them (just search up \"stolen deliveries\" on this sub or on other Apple forums).\n\n**Update (3\/3\/2023)**\n\nThe leasing office updated me about what they saw on the surveillance footage. At the time of the supposed delivery, there was no delivery personnel (FedEx or otherwise) going through the entrance.\n\nI called FedEx in order to update my case with this information, as well as provide them with my leasing offices\u2019 contact information. I also called BPD in order to let the office submit the footage as evidence in the police report.\n\n**Update 2 (3\/3\/2023)**\n\nThe leasing office contacted me again a few hours after the previous update saying that a shipment to my name had arrived. And indeed, it was my MacBook - the tracking number and the serial number matched up, and the laptop had arrived in working condition. ~~I\u2019ll still have to update FedEx and BPD about this resolution.~~ Updated both of them to close their cases.\n\nThat said, **this whole experience remains completely unacceptable.** Most egregiously, FedEx should not have let a complete rando sign on my behalf, then mark the package as delivered when it wouldn\u2019t actually arrive for another two days. And Apple should not have been so hostile to the customer when the delivery of their item has failed.\n\nUltimately I expected a far better experience from a company that markets itself as a premium brand, and I had to waste two and a half days dealing with and worrying about delivery shenanigans and potentially having to initiate  chargebacks or legal action. Plus it\u2019s not my own time that was wasted - I\u2019m sure the leasing office, the BPD officers working on my case, and my friends who were helping me all had better things to do.\n\nFor present and future Apple customers, unless you have no other options (e.g. you live in a remote area), **do not consider Apple delivery.** Other Redditors have stated this advice in the comments below, and now I will join them in repeating it.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677776390.0},{"title":"iPhone 15 Pro's Next-Gen Chip Capabilities Expected to Spark Upgrade Demand Among Current iPhone Owners","author":"klrpwnzsmtms","url":"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/03\/02\/iphone-15-pro-chip-spark-upgrade-demand\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677770864.0},{"title":"Apple Should Support iCloud Drive Backups to Time Machine","author":"theoreticaljerk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11g2dsu\/apple_should_support_icloud_drive_backups_to_time\/","text":"BLUF\/TLDR: Apple should make Time Machine capable of keeping local backups of data that has been offloaded from your device due to iCloud Drive's Optimize Storage option.\n\nApple has Time Machine to support local backups.\n\nApple offers Optimize Storage with iCloud Drive for those who have limited local hard drive space.\n\nUnfortunately, any files MacOS decides to not keep locally due to Optimize Storage will also not get backed up to Time Machine nor other backup solutions that I'm aware of thus reducing those files offloaded to iCloud in a \"one copy state\" and at risk of data loss that can be caused by a multitude of things including user error.  Also changes made to those files on other devices will never make it to Time Machine unless you access that file on the Mac connected to Time Machine causing MacOS to download the file again.\n\nI understand there are folks who have data caps and can not spare the possible excessive data movement which could be caused by such a system but I'd love to see Apple offer an option to get around this.\n\nJust give us an option, along with a warning that the feature could cause excessive data usage, where Time Machine can temporarily download a file from iCloud Drive to back it up then remove the temp file.  It would only need to do this once for the most part as any files you are actively changing after that point would be downloaded anyway.  For files modified on other devices iCloud could use a Modified tag just like local incremental backups use so Time Machine could grab the most recent update for backup.\n\nI dunno, I know this is full on TLDR material for a lot of folks but I'd love if I could get more people to think about this and maybe the community can start giving some pressure that Apple could eventually respond to.  I'm going to submit my suggestions to Apple but one dude ain't going to change the flow of Apples development.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677762560.0},{"title":"Apple TV+ Price Increasing by Nearly 40% ($49.99 -> $69.00 USD)","author":"dylanlucia","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11g51v9\/apple_tv_price_increasing_by_nearly_40_4999_6900\/","text":"[Just got this e-mail indicating the price increase.](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Jv2shyH.jpg) Starting April 2, 2023 for me.

So i instantly got to restoring those files. The website wasnt made to restore many files at once tho, so i had to restore them in packs of around 100files.   \nEvery time I reloaded the website the counter went back up to 5000 since there were much more than 5000 deleted files on my account.\n\nAfter 2 days of almost continuous file restoration i was finally done...  \nBut most of my files, especially the important ones were still missing...\n\nThe (very nice) person from the apple support created a high priority ticket for the technicians in America to look at my case and get my files back.\n\nSadly the support rep called me a few minutes ago with the information that the techs finished the restoration... which by itself would be great news if not almost all of my files were still missing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to sum it all up, I was stupid and trusted Apple that iCloud is a safe place to keep my data and now have lost more than 900gigs of photos, memories, documents and have no way of recovering them. (state registration card, purchase contract of my car,  rental contract of my flat, childhood photos, photos\/memories of deceased relatives, all of my programming work from school, and so on)\n\nSo please always save your important files in multiple places and don't trust big companies to keep your data safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(they should definitely add the feature that OneDrive already has which sends you a notification if large amounts of data got deleted from your cloud storage)","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1677654346.0},{"title":"iPhone 15 USB-C Accessories to Have Limited Data and Charging Speeds Without Apple's MFi Certification","author":"Phooboos","url":"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/02\/28\/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677581646.0},{"title":"Lack of accountability at Apple","author":"prestatiedruk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11gqvi2\/lack_of_accountability_at_apple\/","text":"I'm massively annoyed by the lack of accountability.

Apple needs to find a very difficult balance between: \n1.\tYour data being kept safe from other people \n2.\tYou being able to get your data back even if you stuff up by forgetting or losing something \n3.\tRespecting privacy and trust expectations, particularly with end to end encrypted data \n4.\tDoing the above for the majority of the population that is technically incompetant, forgetful, often doesn\u2019t read or follow basic instructions, and doesn\u2019t plan ahead... \n  \nEven with Apple\u2019s current implementation we see many more people losing access due to forgotten passwords or broken\/lost devices or out of date recovery info etc, vs the kind of theft being addressed here.  Forcing users to know the current password before changing it can\u2019t be implemented without also removing the other password reset methods that trust the same device (eg. pushed 6 digit 2FA codes).  The net impact would be to significantly increase the number of people losing their data or at least being very unhappy at the delays of Account Recovery. \n  \nWhile the obvious best move is for users to use longer alphanumeric passcodes and\/or be careful who is looking when entering the passcode, most people won\u2019t do this and the real world is messy (see #4 above).  I know, I know, personal responsibility and all that but it is what it is. \n  \nSome PROACTIVE steps Apple COULD take, however are:\n1.\tMore user education & warnings (eg. a \u201cSecurity checkup\u201d notification in Settings every 12 months - remind user about the passcode\u2019s critical importance, check&update trusted numbers, recommend using Recovery Contacts, re-enter the Recovery Key to see if you\u2019ve lost it etc) \n2.\tWhen resetting the iCloud password or changing 2FA settings - *IF* a 28 digit Recovery Key is already set, require EITHER the current icloud password OR the Recovery Key to be supplied.  This enhances security for users who have decided to enable the recovery key, but some other people are going to lose their accounts by accident because they lost their recovery key and password... \n3.\t[terrible idea] Add an optional separate passcode for the keychain.  This will lead to some people losing their keychains the same way people lose password protected notes and complain about it despite the warnings they\u2019re given.  The extra passcode can also be extracted from you at gunpoint.  I hate this idea a lot - IMO its better to let people choose to add a separate password manager if they want, and remember this information can still be extracted from you by force - there is no way to avoid this. \n4.\t[terrible idea] Add a \u201cThis device is trusted\u201d setting. Disabling this blocks the device from changing iCloud security settings and receiving pushed 6 digit 2FA codes, or iCloud SMS 2FA codes being sent to it.  It can only be re-enabled via a different device logged into the same account, or with the Recovery Key.  I hate this idea too, its a nightmare. \n  \nAnd some REACTIVE (post-theft) steps Apple COULD take are:  \n\n5.\t Allow the Account Recovery process even if a Recovery Key is set, IF the recovery key was created in the last 1-2 weeks  \n6.\tAllow old (reset) Recovery Keys to be used for 1-2 weeks  \n7.\tAllow password resets via deleted Recovery Contacts, IF they were deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  \n8.\tAllow use of an old trusted phone number for password reset or Account Recovery, IF it was deleted in the last 1-2 weeks  \n9.\tFor arbitration of 6\/7\/8, successful use of an old item invalidates newer items of the same type","upvote_ratio":0.53,"created_utc":1677563629.0},{"title":"Apple\u2019s Secret \u2018XDG\u2019 Team Is Working on More Than Just a Glucose Monitor","author":"iMacmatician","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/newsletters\/2023-02-26\/apple-aapl-exploratory-design-group-xdg-no-prick-glucose-tracker","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677422989.0},{"title":"Mac Pro AMD W6800X Duo Teardown and Windows Test","author":"Stigge","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nuj4JOe7Tak","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677445015.0},{"title":"Daily Advice Thread - February 27, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/11d95et\/daily_advice_thread_february_27_2023\/","text":"Welcome to the Daily Advice Thread for \/r\/Apple.

I started working on it in 2020 during the first UK lockdown as a way to make breathing exercises much more fun and engaging. It's initially a wellness app, but hopefully at some point it can be developed into a platform for people with breathing problems (asthma, COPD and long COVID).

You can also even create your own music using a synth and sequencer (go to Settings\/Create Music).\n\nThere are obviously lots of breathing and meditation apps out there, I wanted Lungy to be different - it's about tuning into your surroundings and noticing the world around you, so all the visuals are nature-inspired or have some reference to the physical world.

The Pixel also has an ecosystem and I would like to find out how the Apple one is to compare, since I heard it's better.\n\nSo I decided to go here to ask for some nice examples of Apple devices working well together.\n\n\n-----------\nUpdate:\nThanks for educating me. Just to summarize what I learned, I decided to create a sort of \"Venn Diagram\" in text.\n\nApple only: using iPad as second screen, handoff (clipboard, files), stats from watch on AppleTV screen, using phone as webcam (although this is coming in Android 14), AirDrop with PC, signing phone documents on PC\n\nBoth: Headphone audio-switching, controlling TV, Find My, Synced texts between PC, phone and watch, \"AirDrop\" (in quotes because it's called Nearby Share on Android), Cloud sync, Password manager integrated into OS, Photos app syncing between devices, unlocking device with another device, AirPlay (Chromecast on Android), home devices automation (turning off TV when you're not home for example) - this last one requires set-up, continuing websites from computer on phone or vice versa, scanning documents to PC, transferring calls to other devices easily, starting maps on watch when phone navigation starts and vice versa\n\nGoogle only: Headphone audio-switching on Windows, Synced texts on Windows, Touching 2 devices to wirelessly transfer files, being able to open Android apps on Windows and them syncing with your phone apps, USB tethering (extremely underrated, low-key amazing)\n\nI think I put everything you guys mentioned in here. Thanks for clarifying, from what it seems, the gap isn't really big.\n\n-----------\nEdit: gotta love how toxic Reddit is. Was curious, so I decided to ask a question. Was rewarded with a 34% upvoted rate and being forced to defend my dignity. Yikes. I'm gonna turn off notifications for this post now.

I started looking into it when I heard about the new release. But more importantly, the possibility of using a pair as a stereo AirPlay device in macOS.\n\nIt had been a while since I was looking for the perfect transportable audio setup, as I am always on the go. I like neutral sound; at home, I have KEF LS50 speakers with a NuPrime amp and the go Campfire Ara IEMs with a Dragonfly DAC\/amp. Finding a good comprise that would allow good sound and the possibility of being transported in a suitcase by plane was challenging. I had been thinking of going with an Apollo Twin and small bookshelves from either PreSonus or Neumann. But it was still a lot of weight, and the setup would not go very low.\n\nI went to the Apple Store for a listening session, but unfortunately, laying HomePods on a table 50 cm below the ears with ambient noise does not do the trick. I ended up coming back home with two.\n\nAfter setting them up as pair and selecting the output in macOS, I opened the Audio Midi Setup to check the bitrate and depth. I was pretty sure I heard AirPlay2 was bringing lossless, but there are some nuances ([Apple AirPlay 2 supports 24-bit lossless audio, but you can\u2019t use it | digitaltrends](https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/home-theater\/apple-homepod-24-bit-lossless-audio-airplay-2\/)), and we are stuck at 16bit 44.1kHz. Figure out the logic behind being in the ecosystem (streaming from a MacBook or an iPhone) but still being software lock to the lowest quality. Cherry on the cake is bye-bye streaming the ALAC library, their own lossless codec.\n\nSound-wise, I admit it\u2019s impressive! They sound way bigger than they are,  the soundstage is excellent. The high feels pretty bright, and the mids are clear. But when it comes to the base, although they are well-defined, they are way too pushed. I check the setting in the Home app to discover that there is an option to reduce bass. It sounds way better; it leaves room for the rest, but it feels like a straight cut below 70Hz. So we are stuck between choosing overkilled lows or no bass; it feels incomprehensible, given the potential of the hardware.\n\nEven with these unpleasant surprises, I will keep the pair of HomePod because it corresponds best to my use case. It\u2019s an unbeatable form factor for the sound, the DSP is great, and the setup is frictionless. It would not take that much to make the HomePod appealing to a broader audience with a software update that:\n\n* Allow lossless streaming via AirPlay from any Apple device\n* Add an EQ setting for the HomePod in Home app","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1677244676.0},{"title":"Luxshare ICT likely to lead development and production of Apple\u2019s first-generation AR\/MR headset","author":"iMacmatician","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@mingchikuo\/%E9%A0%90%E6%9C%9F%E7%AB%8B%E8%A8%8A%E6%88%96%E5%B0%87%E4%B8%BB%E5%B0%8Eapple%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E4%BB%A3ar-mr%E9%A0%AD%E6%88%B4%E8%A3%9D%E7%BD%AE%E9%96%8B%E7%99%BC%E8%88%87%E9%87%8F%E7%94%A2-luxshare-ict-likely-to-lead-development-and-production-of-apples-69cfbd5df72d","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677236606.0},{"title":"Apple is finally removing scam authenticator apps !

This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using \"biometric authentication\" to access your Apple ID.\n* Section 3 (Use of iCloud) has been updated to include a subsection on iCloud Backup, which allows you to backup and restore data from your iOS or iPadOS devices.\n* The previous version of Section 4 (iCloud Services) included a subsection on iCloud Keychain. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead includes a subsection on \"iCloud Private Relay,\" a new feature designed to enhance the privacy and security of your internet activity.\n* Section 6 (User Content) has been updated to include a subsection on Live Photos, which allows you to share animated photos with others through iCloud.\n* Section 10 (Apple's Intellectual Property) has been updated to clarify that Apple may use feedback you provide about iCloud to improve the service.\n* The previous version of Section 11 (Indemnification) included a subsection on the use of Touch ID and Face ID to access iCloud. This subsection has been removed from the current version, which instead refers to using \"biometric authentication\" to access your Apple ID.\n* Section 12 (Dispute Resolution) has been updated to include a subsection on class action waivers, which prohibit you from bringing claims against Apple as part of a class action or consolidated action.\n\nThese are the key changes that I have identified between the previous version and the current version of the iCloud terms and conditions.

I haven't had any issues losing any gadgets in a long while (knock on wood!), so in early January when I was traveling for work and staying in a friend's apartment while he was away it was disappointing when I couldn't find my AirPods. \"Find My\" had listed them at my location a mere 45 minutes earlier, but they were nowhere to be seen. I figured my streak had come to an end and I went out a few days later to replace them (they never popped back up on the map and I had them okay a sound and never heard anything).\n\nSkip ahead to 6-7 weeks later and I had just arrived back at my friend's apartment for another work trip. I always pay for a professional cleaning after I stay there and I walked in to find two earbuds sitting on the counter near the washing machine... ! I felt a pit in my stomach and searched the washing machine for the case and eventually found it in the dryer, sticking to the ceiling. *The AirPods had been washed and dried. * \n\nI reached in and, trying to look on the bright side (they weren't lost, after all), collected the case. I opened it up to take a look and was shocked to see the light go on... And then my phone vibrated and let me know that my AirPods had been located! Could it be, could they be functional? I put the earbuds into the case and plugged it in to charge. \n\nThirty minutes later came the moment of truth--I unplugged them and put them into my ears. The familiar tone sounded and my phone connected to them! And then, I went to Apple Music and ... They sounded perfectly normal! After having been lost for over a month, during which time they were fully laundered, it was as if nothing ever happened!\n\nMaybe I shouldn't be impressed... But I am. To go through that sort of ordeal and still work perfectly well could easily be luck (and it probably is!), but it still shows a level of quality and reliability that I don't readily associate with other brands or products.\n\nAnyway, I don't know why anyone should care about this trivial story, but I thought I'd share so my positive experience is noted and in case it helps anyone to hear it.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1677136620.0},{"title":"Apple invents a fabric apple watch band with an electrochromic feature that allows users to set 3 colors in 3 band zones","author":"OutlandishnessOk2452","url":"https:\/\/www.patentlyapple.com\/2023\/02\/apple-invents-a-fabric-apple-watch-band-with-an-electrochromic-feature-that-allows-users-to-set-3-colors-in-3-band-zones.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677086674.0},{"title":"MacRumors Exclusive: iPhone 15 Design Shown Off in Leaked Images Shared by Unknownz21","author":"Mr__X__","url":"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/02\/22\/iphone-15-images\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677104449.0},{"title":"Daily Advice Thread - February 23, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/119uzn4\/daily_advice_thread_february_23_2023\/","text":"Welcome to the Daily Advice Thread for \/r\/Apple.

Apple's standard warranty expires in August '23 for this unit. It was sold to me as excellent condition, which it was when I received it. It was much brighter than the 4th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro that I also have. I purchased a 6th GEN 12.9 iPad Pro recently. All purchased used, 'Open Box' on eBay. \n\nAs I was synchronizing the settings of the 6th GEN side-by-side with the 4th and 5th GEN units, I noticed that the 5th GEN was much brighter than the other two. Now I realized that on the 5th GEN *True Tone,* a feature of these iPads, wasn't activated yet. But it was! That's when I realized it wasn't functioning! I called Apple and the result was that it needed a repair that was covered under the standard 12 month hardware warranty. So I sent it in to Apple.\n\nI was just informed by Apple that the repair could not be made because there was another problem with the device. The USB plug receptacle was damaged and that it needed to be replaced. That type of damage is not covered under the standard warranty. My choices were to not have the repairs done, or to let Apple keep and recycle the unit or, cough, pay $799 for the repair.\ud83e\udd2e\n\nI used that unit daily since November. I experienced no problem with the USB plug receptacle. Yet here I am. This is not a complaint. My days of complaining are over. I will accept the unit back of course. I'm curious to see what, if any, difference there is with the USB plug receptacle when I receive it back! If it is returned as I sent it in, I can do without *True Tone.* When the 7th GEN iPad 12.9 is released, I'll get that one too.\n\nI always get AppleCare+ but the unit needs to be within the time frame that one would qualify to purchase AppleCare+. This unit was beyond that time period.\n\nWarranties of any kind, from any company, are not black or white. They are gray. In this matter, for me, it is insignificant. But for a hard-working young person who struggles to get along in life, I believe this would be a big disappointment.

I said no, this is my computer, I paid for it, I signed for it, I have all the payment and delivery receipts. He kept insisting and implying that I was a thief. I got my husband involved.

Now with income tracking, overall budgets, UI redesigns and more!","author":"rahfell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/1166geu\/just_released_a_major_update_to_dime_a_beautiful\/","text":"Hey r\/apple! Hope you\u2019re having a great weekend.\n\nTLDR: [Dime 2.0](https:\/\/apple.co\/3ANcqCN) is here with income tracking, overall budgets, a UI makeover and more! It is a beautiful, intuitive expense tracker built with iOS design guidelines in mind. And, it's 100% free with no ads or paywalls.\n\nNearly half a year ago, I launched Dime 1.0 as a project to kickstart my programming journey, and was taken aback by the response. I am immensely grateful for all the comments, reviews, and feedback I have gotten ever since, majority of them being from this subreddit!\n\nThe most requested feature by far had got to be income tracking. I was initially rather reluctant to add this in as it would essentially require a complete overhaul and migration of existing data models and the UI built around them. Additionally, I felt it would diminish the simplicity of the app that many users had grown to love. Nonetheless, with the help of the 300 beta testers on TestFlight, I was able to experiment with different integrations of this new feature, and eventually landed on one I was really satisfied with.\n\nToday, I\u2019m proud to present Dime 2.0, its biggest update thus far. And of course, no changes to the pricing model - still a 100% free with no ads, paywalls, or data collection.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 What's New in V2.0!\n\n-\tThe feature requested in almost every support email - income tracking.\n-\tRedesigned input interface that minimises excessive swiping if you have many categories.\n-\tRedesigned category list with category suggestions and the ability to reorder categories.\n-\tRebuilt the Insights page to minimise lag and crashes.\n-\tLock screen widgets for iOS 16.\n-\tOverall category-less budgets!.\n-\tAdded interactive line graph to the Home page (turned off by default, can be accessed via Feature Lab in Settings).\n-\tInsight filtering configuration now persists between sessions i.e. if you configure your Insights page to show monthly statistics, it will stay that way from then on (and not revert to the default, which is weekly insights).\n-\tAdded triangular indicators to the budget bar graphs which show the optimal spending percentage.\n-\tOption to have a more compact Budgets page by swapping the grid for rows.\n-\tCustom time frames (e.g. 3 days, 5 weeks, 7 months) for recurring transactions.\n-\tSwipe to delete transactions.\n\n\ud83e\udd70 Why You\u2019ll Love Dime\n\n-\t100% free forever, with no paywall or ads.\n-\tBeautifully iOS-centric design, with simplicity at its core.\n-\tInsightful expenditure breakdowns over various time periods.\n-\tCreate budgets based on expense categories and stick to them.\n-\tCreate recurring expenses with custom time frames.\n-\tSync your expenses, categories and budgets with other devices via iCloud.\n-\tCustom reminders to input your expenses.\n-\tBiometric authentication to protect your data.\n-\tHome screen quick actions make capturing new expenses a breeze.\n-\tA gorgeous night theme for dark mode fanatics.\n-\tInformative home and lock screen widgets keep you updated at a glance.\n\nI genuinely hope Dime will be able to help you cultivate prudent expenditure habits. Any feedback or thoughts is welcomed, and appreciated. Moreover, if you have found Dime to be useful, it would be incredibly helpful if you could give it a great review on the App Store. Am unable to afford marketing for a free app, so ratings and reviews are my best bet at spreading the word about it.\n\nA special thanks to all those who have generously tipped the app, all proceeds will go towards my upcoming Apple Developer subscription cycle payment \ud83d\ude0a\n\nHave a great week ahead!\n\nDownload Dime for iOS here: https:\/\/apple.co\/3ANcqCN\n\nFollow Dime on Twitter for more updates: https:\/\/twitter.com\/budgetwithdime\n\nMade with \u2665\ufe0f by [Rafael](twitter.com\/rarfell), from Singapore.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1676799552.0},{"title":"iOS 16.3 can delete data on your iPhone\/iPad without asking - I've lost 2500+ books","author":"ShapeBig5377","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/116lmfa\/ios_163_can_delete_data_on_your_iphoneipad\/","text":"Hello,\n\nIn Feb iOS 16.3 has deleted all my 2500+ books from Apple Books on iPad. ePubs and articles in PDFs, which were sorted in many categories.\n\nProbably, it has happened because my iPad's storage was full and iOS had decided to delete books instead of caches, offloading apps or deleting iCloud photos (which can be re-downloaded from the cloud).\n\nWithout informing the user, of course. iCloud wasn't enabled for Apple Books. No JB.\n\nHere is the story:\n\nI was browsing in the evening, when my iPad has turned off - the battery was empty. I've connected the charger and left it till the morning. In the morning iPad was up and running, I was using it as usual. Few hours later I've opened Apple Books and it was empty: no books, no covers, just empty collections. Checked iPad Storage tab - 50Gb free space (this space was occupied by Books) and Apple Books with 0MB for Documents.\n\nOk, going to logs - nothing unusual. Silence. Ok, I have a full iTunes backup, not the freshest one - 6 months old, but better than no backup at all.\n\nI was able to get into my iPad to make as low-level examination as possible.\n\nWhat I've checked:\n\n    \/var\/mobile\/Media\/Books\/Purchases - empty, all books were deleted\n    BKLibrary - empty, only categories\n    \/var\/mobile\/Media\/Books\/Purchases\/Purchases.plist - empty\n    \/var\/mobile\/Media\/Books\/Purchases\/Backup-Purchases.plist - empty\n    \/var\/mobile\/Media\/Books\/Sync\/Books.plist - some titles and filenames, but not all\n\nI've identified when books were deleted - at 03:52:\n\n    BKLibrary (recovered records):\n    Table ZBKCOLLECTIONMEMBER\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n    .....................................................\n    xx\/02\/2023 03:52:46;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;\n\nThen I've spent almost 1,5 weeks digging in iOS internals and I was able to identify the key suspect - some sort of \"experiments\", which iOS executes on user devices:\n\ndatabase of AppleMediaServices was cleaned by iOS, so traces were hidden, but I was able to recover some data:\n\nmetrics.sqlitedb was hiding this (50+ events when my books were deleted):\n\n    xp_amp_odj\t{\"osVersion\":\"16.3\",\"journeyStarted\":1675634400000,\"eventType\":\"journeys:StepEntered\",\"eventVersion\":1,\"anonymous\":true,\"topic\":\"xp_amp_odj\",\"stepId\":\"CONDITION_1644363747321\",\"stepType\":\"CONDITION\",\"appVersion\":\"1.0\",\"baseVersion\":1,\"checkDU\":null,\"journeyId\":\"1727\",\"eventTime\":1675634400000,\"build\":\"22.0.80\",\"clientEventId\":\"A64208B1-74E3-48E5-A525-DA7AF4B295FF\",\"transition\":\"OK\",\"previousStepId\":\"START\",\"clientOnlyProperties\":{\"checkDU\":false,\"suppressEngagement\":true},\"osBuildVersion\":\"20D47\",\"timezoneOffset\":-xxx,\"osName\":\"iOS\",\"app\":\"com.apple.iBooks\",\"journeyVersionId\":\"4180\"}\txxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\t697384448\txx.02.2023 3:52\n    xp_amp_odj\t{\"osVersion\":\"16.3\",\"journeyStarted\":1675634400000,\"eventType\":\"journeys:StepEntered\",\"eventVersion\":1,\"anonymous\":true,\"topic\":\"xp_amp_odj\",\"stepId\":\"CONDITION_1644363747321\",\"stepType\":\"CONDITION\",\"appVersion\":\"1.0\",\"baseVersion\":1,\"checkDU\":null,\"journeyId\":\"1719\",\"eventTime\":1675634400000,\"build\":\"22.0.80\",\"clientEventId\":\"DCE55495-8632-43F0-9288-8D130160C78F\",\"transition\":\"OK\",\"previousStepId\":\"START\",\"clientOnlyProperties\":{\"checkDU\":false,\"suppressEngagement\":true},\"osBuildVersion\":\"20D47\",\"timezoneOffset\":-xxx,\"osName\":\"iOS\",\"app\":\"com.apple.iBooks\",\"journeyVersionId\":\"3666\"}\txxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\t697384448\txx.02.2023 3:52\n    xp_amp_odj\n    {\"osVersion\":\"16.3\",\"journeyStarted\":1675634400000,\"eventVersion\":1,\"eventType\":\"journeys:StepExited\",\"anonymous\":true,\"topic\":\"xp_amp_odj\",\"stepId\":\"CONDITION_1644363747321\",\"stepType\":\"CONDITION\",\"nextStepId\":\"DISMISS_UNIFIED_MESSAGE_1644351939968\",\"appVersion\":\"1.0\",\"baseVersion\":1,\"checkDU\":null,\"journeyId\":\"1727\",\"eventTime\":1675634400000,\"build\":\"22.0.80\",\"clientEventId\":\"78F6F7D5-F674-4736-A68F-B31CD33A2978\",\"transition\":\"TRUE\",\"clientOnlyProperties\":{\"checkDU\":false,\"suppressEngagement\":true},\"osBuildVersion\":\"20D47\",\"timezoneOffset\":-xxx,\"osName\":\"iOS\",\"app\":\"com.apple.iBooks\",\"journeyVersionId\":\"4180\"}\t\t0\txx.02.2023 3:55\n\nBingo! Time is the same as in BKLibrary when records (and books!) were deleted.\n\nSo, iOS has silently deleted all books.\n\nLater I have written a custom parser, which examined 2 600 000+ rows of raw data of some internal indexes, which iOS uses and it helped me to recover some info: titles and file names.\n\nStill a long way to combine all findings for recovery.\n\nFindings:\n\n* iOS 16.3 can delete all books without asking\n* iTunes Full Backup is not backing up sideloaded PDFs & ePubs in Apple Books\n* When Apple Books app is backed up via iTunes, BKLibrary database is vacuumed, so no deleted data inside.\n* No info is logged about deletion - but I'm checking for extra evidences\n* Logs are clean: no suspicious activity\n* There are no single place with metadata for Apple Books - I'm assembling info piece by piece from many places in iOS: databases, logs, activity data, thumbnails etc. 90% manual work.\n\nI'll make a new post later, including all details related to my Apple Books forensics and recovery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

Random shutdowns on battery have been happening for a number of years but it hasn\u2019t been a priority since it has been plugged in most of the time. We\u2019ve recently brought someone new on and wanted to give them this Mac to use - but they need something reliable while being away from power. \n\nI was pretty sure the battery was the issue, but I did not want to get it replaced only for it to be something more serious like the logic board. We\u2019re a small company and need to be smart about our expenses. The battery cycles are 280-300 for a 7 year old computer. I spent 30 minutes on Apple Chat last week and they recommended going in-store to get it looked at where they can do more in depth diagnostics. It\u2019s a 40 min drive each way, but if it helps illuminate the issue then its worth it. \n\nFirst off, everyone at the Conestoga (Canada) Apple Store was very nice. My complaints are not about their direct service but the corporate policies they have to follow. \n\nThey ran a diagnostic on the laptop and it came back with 80% battery health. They ran the diagnostic plugged in. I had it unplugged a couple of times at the Apple Store and it would shutdown as it usually does when the battery is sub 60%. In the rare cases where it does not shut down the battery drops really fast. \n\nI am more than willing to pay for the battery to be replaced. But, in order to replace the battery on the 2015 models they need to replace the top case (keyboard, trackpad). **Because the battery health is at 80% (and not 79% or lower) - they can\u2019t replace the battery without charging me for a top case replacement! **The battery fee as quoted on their website is $250 (all prices in Canadian dollars), but with the mandatory top case replacement it jumps to around $700. Not worth it for a 7-8 year old computer. \n\nWhat frustrates me is, the Apple Tech in-store had no agency in the matter. It was clear as day the battery was failing and leading to restarts. Yet his own system would not let him order the battery replacement without the top case charge being applied because it was 1% over the required number for it to be eligible. His best solution was to use the laptop on battery as much as possible until it hits 79% and then to come back to get it fixed. Driving 40 mins each way again in the hope that they will replace the battery seems like a bit of a fools errand.\n\nOver the last couple of years I have had other repair needs (Apple Watch battery, AirPods Connection issues) and the experience always ends up being the same. The people at the store can see the issue, but have no agency to get it fixed. \n\nThis laptop in particular, was purchased at the Apple Store for $2500+ CAD, plus Apple Care +. We never used Apple Care before it expired and now we\u2019re being denied a battery replacement (without paying the extra fee) because the health is 1% off replacement level according to their diagnostics. Yet the real world performance is clearly failing at a basic level. \n\nI am a little late to the game in getting Apple Devices, but my impression was that Apple had the best service and while they charge a lot for their tech - the support is top notch. That simply has not been my experience in any interaction I have had with them in the last 3-5 years. I don\u2019t know if this is a Canada issue, or all Apple Stores. But I am just do disappointed in the entire process. I don\u2019t have a lot of free time and to waste it on something like this is really frustrating.","upvote_ratio":0.51,"created_utc":1676778263.0},{"title":"Google said to give Apple cut of Chrome iOS search revenue","author":"mredofcourse","url":"https:\/\/www.theregister.com\/2023\/02\/17\/google_apple_chrome_ios_revenue\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676661126.0},{"title":"Daily Advice Thread - February 18, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/115cw46\/daily_advice_thread_february_18_2023\/","text":"Welcome to the Daily Advice Thread for \/r\/Apple.

Now I am an electronics hobbyist and I know a thing or two about troubleshooting and I did all I could without opening the iPad. When I contacted apple support they told me I needed to make a Genius Bar appointment and the only ones available in a reasonable timeframe were during the work day. So I took a couple hours off to drive out the the apple store only to have to wait an extra 30m after my appointment time for the \"Genius\" to check the USB port for dust and verify it wasn't charging (Something I already did before) before telling me I was screwed and a replacement would be $800. I ended up taking it to a third party repair shop and they replaced the USB C port for $200.\n\nRecently I noticed my AirPod Pro 2 case battery was draining about 20-25% per day without even using the earbuds. Apparently this is a common problem that multiple people report having. I called Apple and they guided me through resetting the device and told me to call them again if the problem persisted, so I did. When I called them again after testing, they told me I could schedule a Genius Bar appointment and get a replacement. So I repeat the process and drive out for the appointment and the \"Genius\" takes my AirPods to the back to run some tests. When he comes back out after 20m he tells me he could not find anything wrong with them and that my options were to live with the problem or send it in to an Apple repair center. I opted to send them in. We'll see if Apple lives up to their warranty or not...\n\nEither way, each of these appointments took about 1h30m of my time only to have Apple's Genius representative to tell me to pound sand. In both of my experiences, the in-person representatives I met were unhelpful, uncompassionate, and slightly rude. Apple products cost way too much to have this poor of a support experience\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention. Apple will not ship my AirPods back to me from their service center.

As a chronically ill person who has more than 12 medications to track (and often change) every day, I was relieved that Apple would finally offer us something that I wasn't getting from 3rd party apps, as well as the bonus of smooth integration across my Apple devices (really important for my physical disabilities). \n\nThe initial offering is ok, but it has HUGE potential. I've no doubt Apple already has a long list of features and changes they plan to make with the functionality but I know from a product development standpoint, it's really important that they hear from the consumers which requests are most vital. I'm not entirely sure if they have, or plan to, consult with people who have chronic or complex health issues, but I do feel it's important we let them know they could really help improve our lives with a few tweaks. \n\nThis realisation led me to start submitting through their [Health feedback form](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/feedback\/health\/). Unfortunately there is a character limit and I know that most people will not submit a form for every single suggestion. I personally gave up after the first 5. So I've come to the conclusion of creating a master thread that can be shared with them directly. That's what I'm hoping to achieve here. \n\nIf you use the Medications feature, or even just tried it but didn't continue, please have your say. If someone has already made a suggestion you agree with, upvote it! Please also include your country, as functionality currently varies and will be helpful to give context to your feedback\/suggestion.\n\nThank you in advance \ud83d\ude0a","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1676608143.0},{"title":"Future Mac Pro may use Apple Silicon & PCI-E GPUs in parallel","author":"chrisdh79","url":"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/23\/02\/16\/future-mac-pro-may-use-apple-silicon-pci-e-gpus-in-parallel","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676566186.0},{"title":"Daily Advice Thread - February 17, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/114hlzb\/daily_advice_thread_february_17_2023\/","text":"Welcome to the Daily Advice Thread for \/r\/Apple.

I ordered an iPhone 14 Pro Max and an Apple Watch Ultra GPS watch through Apple's website, which were supposed to be delivered to me by UberEats. I paid extra for the items to be picked up from a local Apple store and hand-delivered to my address. The Uber driver assigned to the delivery falsely marked it as delivered and never showed up, despite my clear instructions and follow-up text messages. I waited outside the entire time and the delivery wasn't ever made.\n\nI contacted Apple Support, and although they initially agreed to replace one of the items, the watch they later decided to cancel the replacement order, and denied me the replacement for the phone. The result of this has left me with a $2,098.04 hole in my pocket and leaving me with no other recourse. To add insult to injury, unfortunately, the police department is unable to file a report for civil matters.\n\nI am deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and resolution from both Uber and Apple. I have evidence of the conversations with the driver and video footage of me waiting for the delivery outside my building. My question to the community is, has anyone else ever experienced anything like this with Apple, and if so, do you have any recommendations on how to best address this matter?\n\nI hope that my experience will serve as a cautionary tale and that both companies will take steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. I realize that this is an unofficial community site for Apple and while I have no expectations of this message being seen by them, I wanted to raise awareness to everyone making purchases directly from the Apple store, especially via the use of third-party delivery services such as uber-eats and postmates.\n\n**\\*Update 02\/16\/2023\\***\n\nToday, I spent several hours speaking with various Apple representatives from the escalations team. Eventually, I was connected to a \"Senior Manager of the Online Store\" who informed me that the investigation into the matter has been closed and that Apple will not be pursuing any further investigations. According to Apple, a delivery was made, and they will not be compensating me for my losses. I requested evidence that the delivery was made to me personally, but the representative stated that information regarding the internal investigation could not be disclosed to me.\n\nAfter my attempts to contact Apple and resolve this amicably, I feel like I have hit a dead end, and unfortunately, the criminal who stole my $2,098.04 worth of Apple products appears to be getting away with the theft. I am utterly speechless.\n\nI made contact with a second police department in my area who was willing to make a police report and filed this under \"Grand theft\". I now have this along with the other evidence I've collected.\n\n**\\*Update 02\/17\/2023\\***\n\nI am pleased to inform you that a member of Apple's leadership team contacted me and has agreed to issue a full refund for the total cost of the stolen items.  I am thankful for the opportunity provided by Apple to resolve my issue. However, the refund process to my original payment method is still pending, which might take a few days considering the holiday on Monday in the US. I remain optimistic that I will receive my money back by Tuesday and will update this thread as soon as the entire amount has been refunded.\n\nHowever, it is disheartening to know that the criminal responsible for this theft may get away with it. Sadly, this is the unfortunate reality of living in California. Nonetheless, I appreciate the effort and attention given to this matter by Apple's leadership team.\n\nTo the Apple subreddit community, I would like to express my gratitude for the valuable comments, feedback, and advice provided. Your input has been immensely helpful, and I sincerely appreciate your time and effort. Thank you all for your contributions.\n\n**\\*Update 02\/22\/2023\\***\n\nAs of this morning, my bank account has been credited with the total refund amount as per the commitment made by Apple's leadership team.\n\nI also wanted to highlight that despite the promise of two separate representatives asserting that the team responsible for handling loss\/theft of items would be reaching out to me within 24-48 hours on the 16th (6 days ago), UberEats **never** made any attempt to contact me regarding this matter.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1676517563.0},{"title":"Apple Exploring Viability of Foldable Devices With Touch-Sensitive Chassis","author":"yeahyeah2468","url":"https:\/\/forums.macrumors.com\/threads\/apple-exploring-viability-of-foldable-devices-with-touch-sensitive-chassis.2380997\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1676567997.0},{"title":"I am going Watch Only in my Day to Day Life.

My main workstation was still my Intel Mac. Whenever I used the M1, I noticed some cursor stutter after about 20 minutes of working or so. It's like the refresh rate for the cursor suddenly drops to like 24fps.\n\nThis is NOT the general slowdown that you experience when the CPU is busy or the memory is full. It can happen when doing nothing but clicking through items in the finder with nothing else ressource-hungry going on in the background,\n\nWhat \"fixed\" it for a few minutes was to close the lid, open it again, maybe repeat that a few times and the cursor was back normal. This has already been discussed a lot in threads on Reddit and I'm surprised to find the exact same issues still being present after more than 2 years of arm Macs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few weeks ago I had to upgrade my main workstation (Intel MacBook) to an ARM-based Mac. I set up my Magic Trackpad on it. Of course, each new device can feel weird at first but after the first hour of using I noticed that I am still kind of unsuccessful at hitting buttons, marking text etc.\n\n\\- Everything felt imprecise,- the refresh rate would randomly drop like I know it from my 2020 backup mac,- additionally, the cursor would take random jumps\u00a0of like 5cm\/ 2 inches across the screen.\n\nMy productivity dropped as I had to second-guess and correct each cursor movement to get there where I wanted to get. My wrist started hurting on that very day (wrist joint issues were the reason I had to purchase a Magic Trackpad 2 a few years ago in first place and I absolutely loved the Trackpad ever since).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Radio?\n\nI had somewhat similar issues when first moving to a USB-C Mac (the first Intel that required dongles for HDMI, USB etc.) when using a third-party dongle as this has disturbed the radio on the Mac. So back then I bought the original Apple dongle as well which solved these radio issues (also discussed in great extent across reddit).\n\nThis case here is not about radio tho, I also experience these issues when not being connected to an external screen, and not having the dongle plugged in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Third party apps?\n\nSome forum post said that third party apps cause this, so based on Apple Support's advice I went into safe mode and only used Safari for my work, no external screen, no other apps opened: Same results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Comparison with Intel?\n\nThinking I'd go crazy I placed my old Intel mac at the exact same spot on my desk to see if this suffers the same problem. I was blown away at how smooth the Magic Trackpad cursor was on my Intel Mac. It felt like it had twice the refresh rate, twice the precision and none of the pain that comes with using the arm Mac. I need to mention that the Intel and the ARM Mac have the same apps installed because I transfered the whole installation from the Intel Mac to the ARM Mac.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Comparison with other Macs?\n\nAs I know the next step would be a replacement device, I was curious whether that would fix things. To cancel out any issues with apps on my ARM Mac, or with my ARM Mac's hardware even further, I've tried a few friends' ARM Macs (these friends also all know the cursor refresh rate issue on their ARM Mac but don't use a Magic Trackpad). Needless to say, the exact same issues started happening with my friends' computers as well. I attached my \"old\" arm backup Mac and the issue happened on that device as well. To give a short summary:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nM1 Air 2020 on macOS 12.6: Problems\n\nM2 Air 2022 on macOS 13.1: Problems\n\nIntel Pro 2018 on macOS 12.6.2: NO Problems, smooth cursor\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n(Tested with more devices too but this cancels out any macOS version issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Radio part 2 - connection via cable?\n\nThen I found this thread:\n\n[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/253527363](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/253527363) (21 \u201cMe too\u201d)\n\nFor testing, I\u2019ve connected the Trackpad via a lightning cable. It is way better that way. Is it possible that the radio in the MacBook Air M2 is much weaker or placed unfortunately? It really isn\u2019t usable with the arm-based MacBooks.\n\nHowever, the connection via cable isn't perfect either - While working, after a few days suddenly the cursor was unresponsive, the Trackpad couldn\u2019t move or click for a few seconds. After that, it went back to being so wonky again, as if the cable wasn\u2019t attached. Frame rate of the cursor also seemed lower and everything felt indirect. As if the mouse driver went into some kind of compatibility mode that doesn\u2019t do any of the magic that cursor tracking usually involves. Like toggling mouse acceleration in Windows, it feels completely different and weird suddenly. As soon as that happened, I started mis-clicking buttons again because I constantly either overshoot cursor positions (like going past the button that I intended to click) or undershoot them (not reaching the desired cursor position in the first move). Temporarily moving to the Intel Mac, I hit everything as precise as I used to do. To cancel out any bias, I also did tests where I didn't know which device I was connected to and I could always tell the smoothness of the Intel vs the awful navigation in the ARM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Internal Trackpad?\n\nApart from that, as mentioned in the beginning I also often see the cursor stuttering even with the inbuilt Trackpad. It\u2019s like the refresh rate of the cursor drops:\n\n[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/253713321](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/253713321) (221 \"Me too\")[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/253395232](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/253395232) (173 \"Me too\")[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/252777347](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/252777347)[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/252957160](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/252957160) (91 \"Me too\")[https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/253672108](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/253672108) (64 \"Me too\")[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/mac\/comments\/qj77mq\/cursor\\_lag\\_continues\\_on\\_monterey\\_m1\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/mac\/comments\/qj77mq\/cursor_lag_continues_on_monterey_m1\/) (109 upvotes)[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/u486mi\/macbook\\_pro\\_13\\_m1\\_trackpad\\_cursor\\_lag\\_issue\\_no\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/u486mi\/macbook_pro_13_m1_trackpad_cursor_lag_issue_no\/) (125 upvotes)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Trackpad \/ Radio \/ Cursor delay?\n\nAdditionally, I've taken slo mo recordings to measure the delay between my finger moving on the internal Trackpad + external Magic Trackpad and the cursor moving on screen with both processor architectures - I can't find any significant delays that way either. So it doesn't seem to be a latency issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Verdict\n\nMy best guess till now:\n\n* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers, causing the refresh rate to drop\n* ARM Macs have another set of mouse drivers that have different curves for interpolating and accelerating signals.\n* ARM Macs have some additional radio issues, that don't cause all of the problems, but add to them\n\nIn any case, my wrist hurts. Doing the lightning cable thing already helps a lot but I still need to restart the computer every few days due to the above-mentioned issue of the cursor messing up even on lightning. Also, even with the cable attached, it still doesn't feel as direct and smooth as on the Intel Mac.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How to go from here?\n\nI've spent way too much time on this problem already but I'm required to use a macOS device for work and right now it looks like I will have some bad time ahead in the next few years if there is no solution in sight. If you have any info to share, let's work together to be either to either find a workaround, or gather enough information so Apple can finally acknowledge the problem and address it.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1676201548.0},{"title":"iPhones are not the same anymore","author":"Direct_Sky3194","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/110l0qe\/iphones_are_not_the_same_anymore\/","text":"I am a long-time iPhone user.

You can do tasks across your apps, including editors and spreadsheet tools.\n\n**Tones** - To personalize text output and write in your own unique style.\n\n**Preserve Formatting** - So that the generated text maintains the format and styling of the original text.\n\nAnd many more tiny improvements and utilities.\n\n# A brief overview of the tool -\n\nFirst off, very pleased to share that now 500+ professional users use the app every day :)\n\nElephas helps business professionals use AI to save time on day-to-day tasks. Emails, documents, blogs, JIRA stories, social media posts, etc.\n\nOur users praise it as a Swiss Army knife for their daily productivity.\n\n**\"An AI tool that they actually use in their daily workflow\"**\n\nIt differs from other AI tools in that it works on top of your favorite apps, so there is no need to switch between windows or work in a browser window.\n\nYou can get the power of AI within your favorite Mac apps like Mail, Pages, Docs, and any other apps built for the Mac.\n\nWith Elephas,\n\n*   You can rewrite your content, improve it or even generate new content on a topic.\n    \n*   You can use it to quickly reply to your emails, messages, and social media posts.\n    \n*   You can even use it for creating presentations and generating excel formulas.\n    \n*   And now you can even define your own tasks with the \"Snippets\" feature.\n    \n\nBased on our user requests, I introduced the AI assistant to iOS devices (beta).\n\nIt follows the same philosophy, wherein you can use the writing assistant without leaving the app you are writing on.\n\nSo you can use an AI keyboard within Whatsapp, Mail, iMessage, etc.\n\nHere's the demo of how the AI keyboard works -\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/Y5vrH3Clgyo](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Y5vrH3Clgyo)\n\nThere is a wide range of utility features built into the app to make your daily workflow smooth and fast with the power of AI.\n\n**One last point**\n\nThe app is privacy friendly.

They\u2019re in their infancy, but getting better very rapidly. Big tech companies understand this new AI as a massive part of all our futures. Staking a claim and building a leadership position is as important as dominating the web was in the 90s.\n\nMicrosoft announced a new conversational search feature you can start using right now in Bing AND the Edge browser. Google on the other hand just shot themselves in the food with panicking and rushing their Bard thing. \n\n**Where is apple in all of this?**\n\nApple has the tools to build its own generative AI with the Neural Engine built into iPhone and Mac chips that is capable of up to 15.8 trillion operations per second, along with Core ML and machine learning APIs. After all, apple spearheaded AI once with Siri....But we haven\u2019t seen any movement jet\n\n***Conclusion:*** Apple has positioned itself as a technology leader for years now. I don't think they are so badly lead, that apple will give that up! Of course, Apple is one of the most secretive companies in tech, especially when it comes to software. Apple could have big teams working hard to bring generative AI features soon. (They bought at least o ne generative AI company: AI Music) I hope we get a surprise at a coming WWDC: World-class generative AI all over Apple\u2019s products!

Apple has been quiet about their releases and advancements, but with Microsoft and Google both releasing advanced AI models for search, it begs the question: what could Apple be working on?\n\nThere are several probable scenarios in which Apple has a chance to take the lead in the AI race. For one, they have already made significant advancements in on-device processing, which could serve as a foundation for further improvements. They have also announced an AI Summit event later this year. Additionally, Apple has a reputation for keeping their cards close to their chest, so it's possible that they are silently working on something revolutionary.\n\nThe competition in the AI space is fierce, with Microsoft and Google both making giant steps forward in recent months. It's not just a battle between these two tech giants, though, and many people are hoping that Apple will soon join the fray. Bing's reawakening and Google Bard's offering coming up to everyone. \n\nThe future of AI is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: the competition is heating up. Whether or not Apple will be able to go to the next level remains to be seen, but the advancements being made by other companies serve as a reminder of the gigantic steps that companies have to take in order to stay ahead of the game. It kind of feels like 10 years ago when we had a new smartphone release every week... we tried all kinds of new UI features, and the iOS vs Android war was full steam, I'm excited to see what's gonna happen!\n\nWhat do you think?

This year I traded in both, and I received two boxes that to me were identical. They both had instructions for the phone and watch, I recall no clear marking to indicate which was which. I\u2019ll tell you why this mattered.\n\nI accepted a trade in of my phone for $550, and $155 for my watch. Apparently, I mixed up the boxes (still not knowing how I could have known the difference). This resulted in my phone being sent as trade in for the watch, and my watch being sent as trade in for the phone.\n\nNow since I had sent a $550 device in place of a trade in for a $155 device, Apple sent me a gift card for the difference. Since I sent in a $155 device in place of a trade in for a $550 device, Apple had to charge me the difference.\n\nSo I ended up having to pay extra out of pocket than originally planned, and the only saving grace is that I now have an Apple gift card for the difference. Which isn\u2019t really what I wanted, I wasn\u2019t planning on spending any more money in their store for a few months.\n\nI apologize if this is hard to follow, but the PSA here is this: If you trade in a phone and a watch at the same time, be VERY sure you know which box is for which, because if you get it wrong the whole process is super confusing and you\u2019ll pay more than you intended to.","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1675895918.0},{"title":"Apple to implement 2.13-inch Micro displays in the 2024 Apple Watch, with LG Display","author":"Naughty-Insomniac","url":"https:\/\/omdia.tech.informa.com\/blogs\/2023\/apple-to-implement-213-inch-micro-displays-in-the-2024-apple-watch-with-lg-display","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1675875919.0},{"title":"MacBook Pro 16-inch 2023 battery life tested: This is the longest-lasting laptop ever","author":"PurplePlan","url":"https:\/\/www.tomsguide.com\/features\/macbook-pro-16-inch-2023-battery-life-tested-this-is-the-longest-lasting-laptop-ever","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1675818394.0},{"title":"Apple retail employees testing 'Buy Now, Pay Later' service","author":"chrisdh79","url":"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/23\/02\/08\/apple-retail-employees-testing-buy-now-pay-later-service","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675825247.0},{"title":"ProTip: Inserting text in a hyperlink within Apple Notes on iOS","author":"RalphBlutzel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/10wt5yt\/protip_inserting_text_in_a_hyperlink_within_apple\/","text":"There isn't a easy way to create hyperlinks in Apples Notes for iOS.

The way I do it is that I search for the products and examine their current state \/ features and what is coming. In general I am really satisfied with my MBP and iPhone.\n\nHowever, as a pervious Garmin Epix2 owner (now AWU), this is where I feel Apple lacks the most and thought it wouldn't be the case. I am not an extreme athlete, I don't need GPS tracking or outdoor stuff trackings - I am dude that goes to gym, doing strength training. So in terms of 'workout' support, I am not that interested in that.\n\nWhat I find Garmin does way better is the features like: Stress Management, Body Battery, Readiness Score , Morning Report, Step counting, and ..  most interesting to me, Insights. \n\nAt the moment, I have following Apps: Autosleep, HeartWatch and Athlytic (+ Centr for Fitness App). There is no Fitness+ in my country. I did pay for the premium, but I still find it lacklustre, compared to Garmin or even Fitbit (I tested Pixel Watch for a while). \n\nI do not like the idea of having soo many third party apps, but if they would provide me with data the way I imagine Apple would do (nice UI\/UX, straight to the point, no need to be data scientist to understand insights, etc.), I'd be completely fine with that.\n\nSo I came here wondering, if any of you have any info on what is Apple's plan in regards to Health & Fitness features? I learned that they have a dedicated executive role for Apple Health, so I would assume they would make big leaps here - but couldn't find any info on roadmaps or future features.\n\nDid I do my research poorly and the apps I chose are simply not the best for this? Then I would be happy to test some you would suggest for me. For me, I don't need lots of raw data, but rather explanation of data and what can I do about it or what does it tell me about me \/ my pattern.\n\n  \nExamples:\n\n\\- You had only 10min of deep sleep. It is advisable to have X amount for your age and goals. Try going to sleep at Y time and do \\*this\\* before going to bed.\n\n\\- You did only 100 steps so far. It is recommended to do at least XXXX steps per day. To target that goal  you need need to do 250 steps per hour. Get moving now! (And it would actually track steps, not the 'Stand Time' like Apple Watch does).\n\n\\- Your HRV was quite low during the night and your RHR was a bit increased. It seems you did not get enough rest during the night, so track your readiness score throughout the day. If you would like to exercise today, try having a nap in afternoon.\n\n\\- etc.\n\nNow it could be AutoSleep  \/ Athlytic \/ HeartWatch does say that SOMEWHERE amidst tons of numbers and data, but I would like to have it as an 'Insight' section or a Push notification.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1675715316.0},{"title":"Hello from \/r\/Android!

Called Moolight - Smart Diary","author":"Legolas-Wang","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/10ub8we\/i_created_a_smart_diary_that_allows_you_to_have\/","text":"[Download Moolight - Smart Diary](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/ca\/app\/moodlight-intelligent-note\/id1631169735)\n\nInstead of writing a long journal, I love taking short notes throughout the day, in a bullet point format. In this way, I could better record the thoughts that could otherwise be forgotten.\n\nMy girlfriend writes diary every day. The problem she had is that after writing for years, there is no good way to see the changes in yourself, even though all texts are there.\n\nWe tried very hard to search for an app that could fit our need. But failed. **As a result, we took a lot of time to learn and develop our first take on this idea. Of a smart note app.**\n\n**Moolight** is our answer. It features an on-device AI that could help us organize the piece of ideas into 15 categories. And try to provide some insights and feedbacks from all the notes automatically.\n\nWe don't want to sacrifice any privacy, as a result, a decision is made to keep all data to yourself & your own iCloud. After tested out the idea, we found a way to make it even smarter and fit your own record style. As a result, you could train your absolutely unique AI on your device in Moolight.\n\nThe more you write and correct the category, the better your own AI gets. In our own test, with the default AI, the accuracy is about 70% correctness. If you write for about 20 days with 5 bullet points per day, and correct the category. Your could own a unique AI that do chores sorting out your notes 100% categories correctness for all your notes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why bother creating another note app?**\n\nComplex tools makes it's easy to get lost. When using simple tools, the notes could easily scattered everywhere. Why can't software help? We live in an age when technology advances every day, yet the software for notes seem to become unchanged since long time ago.\n\nThat's why we spent long time, realizing this idea. And had great fun developing this product. The idea is about writing without being disturbed. Enjoy the ease of use brought by technological advances while having absolute privacy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Design Thoughts**\n\nMy girlfriend is a data scientist, and I had background in software and design. We wanna to combine our experiences, and attempt to give this idea our best effort. Since day one, we discussed and settled on the following ground rules:\n\n1. We believe everyone should be the sole owner of our data, especially in a case for note or diary. So data never leaves your device or iCloud. All data should be processed on-device with neural engine. It should be 100% functional when offline.\n2. We wanna it to be smart, to make life easier. To do this, it should know how we feel when we write; It should know the realtime weather so my gf don't need to type in manually; It should know I'm writing about food, without specifying the category. It should be able to track anything that we ever want to know if we wrote about it.\n3. We wanna it to be able to think. To write a short headline each day and help us recall. It should know the top content I'm constantly writing about, and use my data to give us some feedback. We wanna it know them all, yet do not ask for any information besides what I actually write.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why there are three tabs?**\n\nToday, Gallery and Insights.\n\nThe idea is that whenever you want to write something, it's in the Today tab, this is where you focus on the moment. When you want to have a look at the past. All the information is well organized and truthfully present to you in Gallery tab.\n\nWe can't predict the future. However, in some way, we could also get a glimpse of idea about future based on what we were doing in the past. This is what Insights tab do.\n\n\u25b6 Today \u25c0 \u2022 Bullet Based Input \u2022 Automatic added Weather & Location \u2022 Mood Lights to Know Your Feeling \u2022 Time Travel to Past and Future \u2022 Dynamic Background that Flows.\n\n\u25b6 Gallery \u25c0 \u2022 Refined Card with Mood Color \u2022 Daily Auto Headline \u2022 Auto Classification for Each Input \u2022 Powerful Search by Time and Types.\n\n\u25b6 Insights \u25c0\u2022 Cumulative Days, and Inputs Count \u2022 Weekly Glance to be Surprised \u2022 Keyword to Know What Mattered \u2022 Track Anything as Tags \u2022 Know What made you Happy with Mood Trend \u2022 Random Show to Recall Memories \u2022 Mapped Journey to Mark your Path \u2022 Liked\/Web Records to Shortcut \u2022 Customize Modules on Your Preference.\n\n\u2022 iCloud Sync and Backup for iPhone\/iPad\/Mac \u2022 Face ID for Additional Safety \u2022 Customize Color, Typography, etc \u2022 Recycled Bin for Accidental Delete \u2022 Automatic Light and Dark Mode.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What can it do?**\n\n**\u2022 Intelligent Classification**\n\nDeclutter the life events. Work, Food, Study and so on. It just knows.\n\n**\u2022 Understand Your Mood**\n\nHow\u2019s your day?

After set up, I noticed that it said \u201cCoverage Expired\u201d. Weird but no biggie, I\u2019ll just call Apple and it\u2019ll be sorted out soon. Or so I thought. \n\nFirst CSR asked me to provide proof of payment which I gladly did. I even screenshared my phone to show the receipt in my email. He asked me to upload my screenshots. No problemo. He then transfers me to another CSR.\n\nI\u2019m 20 minutes into what I thought would be 5 mins. The second CSR informs me that due to the fact that it\u2019s a Series 6 they can\u2019t update the Date of Purchase. Excuse me? I bought it brand new from a reputable retailer (Sportchek). It wasn\u2019t open box or anything. The box was sealed. The CSR gives me this gem: because the AW was shipped to the retailer in 2020, they cannot update the Date of Purchase. \n\nThis was shocking to hear. I told her that it doesn\u2019t matter to me as the end consumer when a product was shipped to the retailer. I bought it new and they have to honour the manufacturer\u2019s warranty. She transfers me to her manager. \n\nI\u2019m now 45 minutes into this call. Manager gets on the phone and asks me what the issue was. I explained how I\u2019m being told that Apple does not cover its own new products just because of when they were shipped to a retailer. She apologizes and agrees with me and goes ahead and approves the update to the Date of Purchase. Finally!! \n\nTook me almost an hour on the phone to get done what should have never been an issue in the first place. So DO NOT let Apple reject your request to update the Date of Purchase if you bought a NEW Apple product. Consumer laws exist to protect the end users from this sort of bs.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1675450578.0},{"title":"Daily Advice Thread - February 04, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/apple\/comments\/10tdu79\/daily_advice_thread_february_04_2023\/","text":"Welcome to the Daily Advice Thread for \/r\/Apple.
