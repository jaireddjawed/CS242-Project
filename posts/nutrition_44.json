I know this is obviously not the best way to trigger this and is completely a cheat, but I’m trying to find out more about this as I find it interesting and I want to make sure I don’t ever over do this or if I ever do use this as a cheat, to make sure I don’t do it in the incorrect way. But what I can’t workout is the amounts of sugar that’s necessary for this to be optimal, or how you calculate that based on bodyweight. If anyone knows anything about this or I have gotten any details wrong then please help me out as I find this interesting and would love to learn more about it!",
