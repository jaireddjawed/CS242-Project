        "text": "I know that most of you guys aren't huge fans of this episode, but it hit me harder than most of the others and really resonated with me. In my eyes, it's an episode about depression and how the protagonist gets so close to escaping it, but ends up far worse than he was before.\n\nHe's basically forced into being this character that he isn't proud of because, at that point, it's just kind of what he does. He feels like he can't escape it, even if he realistically could have. Then he's forced into a sort of political figure, where he finds somebody who might actually make him happy. Then he gets crushed by her and, out of frustration, ruins his chances with her.\n\nHe tries to fix what he did to her and to politics in general, but it's too late. She lost her legitimacy as a politician and won't forgive him, and he may have permanently broken the system by making everybody lose faith in it. And by trying to fix it, he got himself fired and hated by the public, leaving him homeless and more depressed than ever.\n\nAs a depressed person this episode hit me like a fucking brick and it's easily one of my favorites. What do you guys think of it?",

I thought it would be a good idea to provide Black Mirror themed snacks to the people viewing my presentation; one snack per episode. I'm aware that the joke will be lost on most people, but if even one person appreciates it, it will be worth it.\n\nThe problem is that I don't know what to do for some episodes, so if any of you have some ideas, they would be greatly appreciated! Bear in mind that I live in the UK, so I don't have easy access to things that aren't available here. Here's what my friend and I have thought of so far (potential spoilers?):\n\n**The National Anthem** - [Spoiler Alert](/s \"Percy Pigs\")\n\n**15 Million Merits** - [Spoiler Alert](/s \"Individually wrapped apple\")\n\n**The Entire History of You** - ???\n\n**Be Right Back** - ???\n\n**White Bear** - [Spoiler Alert](/s \"White gummy bears\")\n\n**The Waldo Moment** - [Spoiler Alert](/s \"Blue gummy bears\")\n\n**White Christmas** - ??? [Spoiler Alert](/s \"Something resembling a spiked drink maybe?\")\n\n**Nosedive** - [Spoiler Alert](/s \"Magic Stars\")\n\n**Playtest** - ???\n\n**Shut Up and Dance** - [Spoiler Alert](/s \"A slice of cake with 'I love you' icing\")\n\n**San Junipero** - [Spoiler Alert](/s \"Yorkie bar\")\n\n**Men Against Fire** - ???\n\n**Hated in the Nation** - ??? [Spoiler Alert](/s \"Preferably something with honey\")\n\nI haven't seen Series 4 yet, but I still have a few days to go. I will trust those who have seen it with suggestions. :)",

The darkness of the past is something that we believe could be fact in the future which is why they work so well.  Even the most ridiculous of ideas all seem believable because of the technology they use throughout the series.\nI just find it hard to explain the show to ppl who have never seen it ( they all think I am mad or been dreaming) but the fact this show takes me to places that I didn’t believe were possible for a tv show to do and that is why I am such a fan.",

        "text": "After rewatching many episodes, my mind keeps going back to the cookie idea.  Taken at face value, the cookies are described to us as a replication of ones conscious.  \n\nOk, sounds simple enough.  We've seen enough examples that the notion seems believable enough without any reason to doubt that.  Upon further thought though, I found some things very interesting, possibly hinting at something more.  White Christmas, USS Callister, San Junipero, and Black Museum all deal with the concept of replicated consciousness, but they all are missing 1 particular thing:  there is only 1 copy of a cookie at any given time.  This could simply be a narrative choice, but I wonder if it hints that there really is something unique that happens when a cookie is \"generated\", if something human actually transfers.  \n\nI find it strange that we never see cookies backed up or copied.  In \"white Christmas\", Jon Hamm says that if he breaks a cookie too much they are sold off cheap to game companies, but he doesn't mention anything about starting over for that customer.  Similarly, in Black Museum, the death row inmate is broken.  At first Rolo takes care not to allow him to be damaged, then finally does.  If he is just code, why wouldn't they just have every visitor fully kill him, and replicate a new version?  If not every visitor, at least at the end of every day.  I feel like the wife's line of \"it's your soul...\" might have more weight than we initially thought.  Not too different with USS Callister, I'd guess the only thing better than torturing one of your hated enemies, is torturing 4 of him at once.  \n\nAnother thing that I find extremely disturbing about the cookies in white Christmas is that we're never explicitly shown how they are marketed.  I found it odd initially that  the voice announcing didn't have the woman/cookie's voice, which made me think that maybe the purchaser is completely unaware of what a cookie is.  Could be simply marketed as \"give us a week to analyze your likes and dislikes, and our automation software will be able to predict everything for you!\".   Made it even more disturbing to me that these people may be completely unaware they are enslaving and torturing themselves, when they think they are just buying a badass Alexa\n\nA far",

Throughout the whole think I kept thinking of how similar it felt to White Bear - the set up, it all being scripted, etc. Even after the ‘guests’ found out it was fake, at that point they have gone through an hour of psychological torment which I think, if it was me, would really stay with me. I’m not going to give away the ending (because you should all definitely watch it!) but that was very BM too. Has anyone seen this? What were your thoughts? It’s available on Netflix (at least in my country) so go watch it now if you haven’t yet and come back and discuss here! ",
