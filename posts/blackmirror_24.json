They'd have a lot of free time.\n\nAnd it could go even further.

Cooper says his dad died after developing early onset Alzheimer's, but when he visits his mom (conveniently up the stairs and the last door on the right, like in the mansion, hey!) she seems to be displaying symptoms.\n\nWhat do y'all think happened? Did his dad have Alzheimer's and die, and he imagines his mom losing it too? Is his mom the one who actually has it, his dad is who knows where, and Cooper lies to Sonia about which parent has it, because he is so guilty to have abandoned her? Also maybe why she always calls, and he doesn't want to answer when she calls...?\n\nSounds like he didn't call his mom at all over a loooong period of traveling. We see him send two texts but no idea if he's texted her otherwise. Yet she's not out calling the authorities for her son... which would make sense if she had Alzheimer's but not if she was fully aware of her son up and leaving one day for months without calling. \n\nAlso, he freaked out when he thought he was losing his mind, but seemed to get it when his mom forgot who he was.\n\nAnyhow.

Black Mirror seems to always put emphasis on the clone of the characters mind almost making it that the \"main\" part of the character got stolen. This may be because they don't tend to follow the real world characters emotions much. White Christmas is a good example of this, her cookie \"soaks up\" her brain. I guess I'm just curious on what people think about this and if the real world characters are still the same as they were before without realizing what has even gone on. For me at least the thrill or paranoia of these episodes really onsets when you imagine your self knowingly getting trapped in one of this white abysses, as if the \"main\" part of my mind was stolen and my real self is just a mindless robot.

There wasn’t any crazy twist, except ***SPOILER ALERT*** the fact that they were risking their lives for a teddy bear for a sick child? Which is great and all but seemingly unrealistic for how much fear they all showed towards the dogs. \n\nIs it just me or did this episode just not feel ...twisted enough? I don’t even know. I mean, it had a nice creepy vibe, and gave me the feelings I think it was meant to give (suffocating, heavy, hopeless, the scent of copper) but at the same time there was no “Black Mirror moment” like the other episodes.\n\nI didn’t have that trademark *wtf* moment. \n\nIdk, am I reading into it?

Since this is an anthology series, it doesn't matter what order you watch it in and I plan on watching episodes during school (I'm in 8th grade in case anyone is wondering. Since the school year is coming to an end, we're going to be having more days where we just do whatever we want on Chromebooks.) The first three episodes had sexual content and the bad language doesn't matter because I'll be wearing headphones. ",
