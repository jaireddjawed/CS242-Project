Wade* most surprising reaction at the time was the Supreme Court's Wade decision, which ruled that abortion rights were constitutional. \n\n\nSince then, issues such as sexuality, gender, conception, family life, education, and blasphemy have been on the agenda of activists. In identifying the villains, they pointed to \"secular humanists,\" religious liberals, corrupt elites of large, inclusive governments, mass media, and education as antichrists.\n\nFundamentalism, a movement or characteristic of more than a definable church, is a term rarely used in church or denomination names. \n\nFor example, the word does not always appear in telephone directory advertisements in major cities or church telephone directories. \n\nIt is therefore difficult to ascertain how many fundamentalists there are in the United States or in the dissent movements that have emerged as a result of American missionary work around the world. \n\nNumbering is also difficult because many of the successors of those who chose the name \"fundamentalist\" for themselves recognize that it can create a stigma and do not want to be labeled as such. \n\nThe leader of the largest Protestant group, the Southern Baptist Convention, has all the characteristics most scholars would consider an ally, an enemy, and a fundamentalist. \n\nBut most of these Baptists hate adjectives and should be used with caution.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/11qbs5x/the_symbolism_of_abraham_and_the_ram_plus_an/",
        "text": "Most people around here will have some familiarity with [the story of Abraham, Isaac and the Ram](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2022&amp;version=NIV).\n\nSo there are a couple of ways to read this passage. One is to insist on literalism, which we won't do.\n\nThe other is to understand the story as communicating a message (or wisdom). The full symbolic/allegoric meaning is best understood with some additional context.\n\nGod expects people to exercise faith. This means avoiding sin and being obedient to God's will.\n\nIn Genesis 22; it seems like God's will is for Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac as \"a burnt offering\".\n\nIn the story, Abraham doesn't even blink... or ask question or try to plead for his son's life. He simply goes ahead and prepares to sacrifice his son.\n\nThen the story takes a sharp turn. An angel of the Lord tells Abraham...\n\n\"Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him\". \n\nAnd...\n\nNow I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son\n\nSo in plain English, Abraham understands that his faith is strong. He is willing to do something that surrounding cultures practiced. And the story also indicates that God does not accept this practice. \n\nInstead, a ram is substituted for the sacrifice. Animal sacrifice OK, human sacrifice not OK.\n\nSo in Genesis we have the strongest scriptural indication that child sacrifice was not acceptable to God. And we've got plenty more scripture describing those who practiced such beliefs as \"detestable\" or \"filthy\".\n\nhttps://www.gotquestions.org/child-sacrifice.html\n\n&gt;God prohibited Israel from child sacrifice in general and Molech worship in particular. Leviticus 20:2-5 states, “Say to the Israelites: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Molek is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him. I myself will set my face against him and will cut him off from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Molek, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Molek and if they fail to put him to death, I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them off from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Molek.’” Many other Old Testament passages affirm God’s zero-tolerance for child sacrifice.\n\nSo what's my point? What's the take home message?\n\nIf you accept the scripture in Genesis as being holy and inspired, you are prohibited from allowing a child to die because of your religious beliefs.\n\nEven if/when those beliefs are coming straight from God Himself, if your understanding of His will would/might result in the (preventable) death of a child... His will is for the child to live.\n\nIn Genesis, a Ram is provided. If you're a Christian, this Ram serves as an effective symbol for Jesus.\n\n&gt;Both Isaac and Jesus are long-awaited “beloved sons” who are born in miraculous circumstances (Gen. 22:1\nGenesis 22:1\nLoading...\nKeep Reading\n; Matt. 3:17\nMatthew 3:17\nLoading...\nKeep Reading\n). Both sons carry the wood that is to be the instrument of their deaths on their backs (Gen. 22:6\nGenesis 22:6\nLoading...\nKeep Reading\n; John 19:17\nJohn 19:17\nLoading...\nKeep Reading\n). In both stories, the father leads the son up a mountain, and the son follows obediently toward his own death (Gen. 22:3\nGenesis 22:3\nLoading...\nKeep Reading\n; Matt. 26:39\nMatthew 26:39\nLoading...\nKeep Reading\n). And in both scenarios, God provides the sacrificial substitute, which Abraham says will be a ram (a male lamb) and the New Testament authors identify as Jesus, “the lamb of God”\n\n[Source](https://bibleproject.com/blog/why-did-god-ask-abraham-to-sacrifice-isaac/)\n\nAnd if you're still with me...\n\nLet's say you has an understanding about God's will where, in some cases... that understanding is taken to a very detailed degree.\n\nAnd now let's say, you want to keep to that understanding. To not sin, but also to show that the strength of your faith is as great as Abraham's.\n\nBut God does not want (or accept) anything more than faith. And He has provided a substitute. You can fail to comply with his scriptural will... knowingly and deliberately. And you can know, based on scripture, the God has already provided a substitute (Jesus). \n\nAs a real world and relevant example, consider the Jehovah's Witnesses and their position on blood transfusions.\n\nThey don't accept any food or drink that contains blood in any form.\n\nThey also don't accept a blood transfusion *under any circumstances*. They extend this refusal even to major blood fractions (ie. platelets, plasma, RBCs and WBCs).\n\nThey may, according to their conscience, accept minor blood fractions.\n\nBut I believe that, according to scripture, they must not refuse medical treatments if there's absolutely no other effective alternative. \n\nIf someone let's their child die because of their religious beliefs, there is essentially no difference between them and those Molech worshippers.\n\nI think that many Witnesses would reject this line of reasoning. But they themselves do everything \"by the book\" (ie. the Bible). And if there's a solid scriptural basis for doing something (or *not* doing something) they will follow what's contained in the scriptures.\n\nSo I think they might eventually reconsider their position regarding this particular issue. I know one Witness who is very knowledgeable in their beliefs. His reaction will most likely be to tell me I'm wrong. But I'm going to directly suggest to him that he pass this along... hopefully all the way to the Governing Body.\n\nThey don't need to let kids die.\n\nGod doesn't want those kids to die out of a person's desire to show faith.\n\nAs true Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses believe the God provided Jesus as the ultimate substitute offering.",

        "text": "If there is ever an issue that keeps dominating the headlines when it comes to the Roman Catholic Church, it is the clerical abuse scandal. The wickedness of the abuse itself, as well as the cover ups is something that we see all the time reported in the media over the decades with bombshell report after bombshell report. Pope Francis isn't the first Pope to deal with this issue but he is the latest. He has of course condemned this abuse and apologised repeatedly. As a disclaimer this post is not meant to make the case that some how verbal condemnations and apologies are enough. It is a historical look though at theological precedents in condemning and tackling the issue of clerical abuse in terms of precedents and how that informs Pope Francis's current statements and views on the topic. So here goes.\n\n**(1)Theological precedents:**\n\n* *\"Parents and other Christians who give up their children to sexual abuse are selling others' bodies, and if they do so or sell their own bodies, they shall not receive communion even at death\"\\_Council of Elvira(Canon 12, 305 A.D)*\n* \"*Bishops, presbyters, and deacons, once they have taken their place in the ministry, shall not be given communion even at the time of death if they are guilty of sexual immorality. Such scandal is a serious offense\"\\_Council of Elvira(Canon 18, 305 A.D)*\n* *“Any cleric or monk who seduces young men or boys, or who is apprehended in kissing or in any shameful situation, shall be publicly flogged and shall lose his clerical tonsure. Thus shorn, he shall be disgraced by spitting in his face, bound in iron chains, wasted by six months of close confinement, and for three days each week put on barley bread given him toward evening.\"*\\_St Basil the Great(4th century)\n* “*Listen, you do-nothing superiors of clerics and priests. Listen, and even though you feel sure of yourselves, tremble at the thought that you are partners in the guilt of others; those, I mean, who wink at the sins of their subjects that need correction and who by ill-considered silence allow them license to sin. Listen, I say, and be shrewd enough to understand that all of you alike are deserving of death, that is, not only those who do such things, but also they who approve those who practice them.*”\\_St Peter Damian(Letter 31)\n* \"*For if a kiss is struck with a punishment of such severe retribution, what does fornication between the thighs merit? For punishing what crime, for what monstrous offense would it not suffice to be publicly beaten, to lose the tonsure, to be disgracefully shaven, to be smeared with the filth of saliva, to be confined for a great length of time, and furthermore to be bound in iron chains? And finally it is prescribed that he is to be fed on barley bread, because he who has become like a horse and a mule is not properly refreshed with the food of men, but is fed with the grain of mules*.\"\\_St Peter Damian(Book of Gomorrah, chp XVI on abuse of adolescents or children)\n* \"*O unheard of crime! O offense to be mourned with a whole fountain of tears! If they who consent to those who do these things are to be struck with death, what can be conceived of as a worthy punishment for those who commit these evils, which are punishable by eternal damnation, with their spiritual children? What fruit can be found in the flocks, when the pastor is so profoundly submerged in the belly of the devil? Who might now remain under his rule who is not ignorant of his so hostile estrangement from God? Who makes a male prostitute out of penitent, a woman out of a man? Who subjugates as a slave him whom he spiritually generated as a son by God, through the iron rule of diabolical tyranny by the impurity of his flesh?*\"\\_St Peter Damian(Book of Gomorrah, chp VII)\n* \"*So that the deceits of diabolical machination may not lie hidden, but rather that I might expose to the light those things that the devil secretly constructs with his secretaries in the workshop of ancient evil, I will not suffer it to be concealed that certain individuals, satiated by the poison of this crime, when, as it were, they return to the heart, confess the sin to one another so that the crime may not be exposed to the notice of others. Although as authors of the crime they cause the faces of men to blush, they themselves become judges, and each one rejoices to extend to the other an indiscreet pardon, which he seeks to apply to himself by vicarious exchange. So it is that they might be penitents of great sins, and yet their mouths are not pallid by reason of fasting, nor their bodies wasted by leanness; and while their stomach is in no way restrained from the immoderate reception of food, the soul is shamefully inflamed in the fire of habitual lust, so that he who has not yet wept for his crimes, commits even more lamentable acts. It is a precept of law that when anyone is covered with leprosy he must be shown to the priests. However, when one filthy man confesses to another the common evil that has been committed, the leper is not shown to the priests but rather to another leper*\"\\_St Peter Damian(Book of Gomorrah, chp viii)\n* \"*So that the contagion of such a grave offense may not advance with greater audacity by taking advantage of impunity, which is the greatest incitement to sin, and so as to more severely punish the clerics who are guilty of this nefarious crime and who are not frightened by the death of their souls, we determine that they should be handed over to the severity of the secular authority, which enforces civil law Therefore, wishing to pursue with greater rigor than we have exerted since the beginning of our pontificate, we establish that any priest or member of the clergy, either secular or regular, who commits such an execrable crime, by force of the present law be deprived of every clerical privilege, of every post, dignity and ecclesiastical benefit, and having been degraded by an ecclesiastical judge, let him be immediately delivered to the secular authority to be put to death, as mandated by law as the fitting punishment for laymen who have sunk into this abyss*\"\\_Pope St Pius V(Horrendum Illud Scelus, 1568)\n* \"*We again commit to and ask the Inquisitors of Heretical Depravity and the Orders of every realm, of the provinces, states, dominions and locations of the whole Christian world, that they in their respective dioceses, diligently and with mortal respect, cast aside, seek out and proceed against everyone, every priest as much as seculares as regulares, however much exempt, and also those immediately subject to the Apostolic See, of whatever Orders, Institutions, Societies or Congregations, whether supported by the privilege or dispensation of any rank or preeminence-who have essayed to tempt a penitent, whoever that person is, in the act of sacramental confession, whether before or immediately after, whether on the occasion or pretext of confession, whether even outside the times of confession in the confessional, or in a place other than that designated for hearing confessions or in a place chosen for the alleged purpose of hearing confession; the object of this temptation is to solicit or provoke the penitent to impure and obscene matters, whether by words or signs or nods of heads , whether by touch or by writing, or after the note has been read....Let the Inquisitors punish with severely punish those whom they shall find guilty.*.\"\\_Pope Benedict XIV(Sacramentum Poenitentiae, 1741)\n* \"*Rape is the forcible violation of the sexual intimacy of another person. It does injury to justice and charity. Rape deeply wounds the respect, freedom and physical and moral integrity to which every person has a right. It causes grave damage that can mark the victim for life. It is always an intrinsically evil act. Graver still is the rape of children committed by parents or those responsible for the education of children entrusted to them*\"(Catechism of the Catholic Church, prg 2356)\n* \"*Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized. It prompted our Lord to utter this curse: 'Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.' Scandal is grave when given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others. Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account: he likens them to wolves in sheep's clothing*\"(Catechism of the Catholic Church, prg 2285)\n\nNow a couple of interesting notes on what is mentioned above. Firstly when researching Medieval Christendom's attitudes to sexual abuse a fascinating aspect is demonstrated at the Council of Nablus in the Crusader states called by the Church leadership. It instituted many canons and one included penalties for if a Christian man sexually abuses or rapes a Muslim woman. The penalty is castration. Second interesting point is Pope Pius V, who issued that very harsh penalty on \"sodomy\"(which had a wide definition, including sexual relations with minors) is actually recorded as implementing his strict decree. In 1570 when a Canon was found having relations with a choir boy, he had him removed from his office and rank and then publicly beheaded. Furthermore, the office of the Inquisition was in charge of prosecuting cases of sexual abuse and pedophilia, many of which resulted in the death sentence.\n\nThis list though shows that in terms of condemnation of the crime of sexual abuse, clerical abuse and scandal in the Church this isn't a new thing. You have had reformers, activists, Church leaders, canonised saints along with Church teaching that does this. So in this context Pope Francis is not doing anything new. In this regard he is already standing on a centuries old foundation when it comes to doctrine and teaching on this issue. In this regard these are the ways these teachings, as well as the scandal itself, influences his perspective on these things in quotes:\n\n* \"*The sexual exploitation of children is yet another scandalous and perverse reality in present-day society. Societies experiencing violence due to war, terrorism or the presence of organised crime are witnessing the deterioration of the family, above all in large cities where, on their outskirts, the so call phenomenon of street children is on the rise. The sexual abuse of children is all the more scandalous when it occurs in places where they ought to be most safe, particularly in families, schools, communities and Christian institutions*\"\\_(Amoris Laetitia, prg 45)\n* \"*It is true that the scourge of the sexual abuse of minors is and historically has been, a widespread phenomenon in all cultures and societies, especially within families and in various institutions; its extent has become known primarily thanks to change in public opinion. Even so this problem, while universal and gravely affects our societies as a whole....is in no way less monstrous when it takes place within the Church. Indeed, in people's justified anger, the Church sees the reflection of the wrath of God, betrayed and insulted*\"\\_(Christus Vivit, prg 96)\n* \"*Abuse exists in various forms: abuse of power, the abuse of conscience, sexual and financial abuse. Clearly, the ways of exercising authority that make all this possible have to be eradicated, and the irresponsibility and lack of transparency with which so many cases have been handled have to be challenged. The desire to dominate, lack of dialogue and transparency, forms of double life, spiritual emptiness, as well as psychological weaknesses, are terrain on which corruption thrives. Clericalism is a constant temptation on the part of priests who see the ministry they have received as a power to be exercised, rather than a free and generous service to be offered. It makes us think that we belong to a group that has all the answers and no longer needs to listen or has anything to learn. Doubtless, such clericalism can make consecrated persons loses respect for the sacred and inalienable worth of each person and or his or her freedom*\"(Christus Vivit, prg 98)\n* \"*If one member suffers, all suffer together with it” (1 Cor 12:26).  These words of Saint Paul forcefully echo in my heart as I acknowledge once more the suffering endured by many minors due to sexual abuse, the abuse of power and the abuse of conscience perpetrated by a significant number of clerics and consecrated persons.  Crimes that inflict deep wounds of pain and powerlessness, primarily among the victims, but also in their family members and in the larger community of believers and nonbelievers alike.  Looking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient.  Looking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated.  The pain of the victims and their families is also our pain, and so it is urgent that we once more reaffirm our commitment to ensure the protection of minors and of vulnerable adults*\"(Letter to the People of God, 2018)\n* \"*In recent days, a report was made public which detailed the experiences of at least a thousand survivors, victims of sexual abuse, the abuse of power and of conscience at the hands of priests over a period of approximately seventy years. Even though it can be said that most of these cases belong to the past, nonetheless as time goes on we have come to know the pain of many of the victims.  We have realized that these wounds never disappear and that they require us forcefully to condemn these atrocities and join forces in uprooting this culture of death; these wounds never go away. The heart-wrenching pain of these victims, which cries out to heaven, was long ignored, kept quiet or silenced.  But their outcry was more powerful than all the measures meant to silence it, or sought even to resolve it by decisions that increased its gravity by falling into complicity.  The Lord heard that cry and once again showed us on which side he stands.  Mary’s song is not mistaken and continues quietly to echo throughout history.  For the Lord remembers the promise he made to our fathers: “he has scattered the proud in their conceit; he has cast down the mighty from their thrones and lifted up the lowly; he has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty” (Lk 1:51-53).  We feel shame when we realize that our style of life has denied, and continues to deny, the words we recite*.\"(Letter to the People of God, 2018)\n* \"*If one member suffers, all suffer together with it”, said Saint Paul.  By an attitude of prayer and penance, we will become attuned as individuals and as a community to this exhortation, so that we may grow in the gift of compassion, in justice, prevention and reparation.  Mary chose to stand at the foot of her Son’s cross.  She did so unhesitatingly, standing firmly by Jesus’ side.  In this way, she reveals the way she lived her entire life.  When we experience the desolation caused by these ecclesial wounds, we will do well, with Mary....She, the first of the disciples, teaches all of us as disciples how we are to halt before the sufferings of the innocent, without excuses or cowardice.  To look to Mary is to discover the model of a true follower of Christ. May the Holy Spirit grant us the grace of conversion and the interior anointing needed to express before these crimes of abuse our compunction and our resolve courageously to combat them.*\"(Letter to the People of God, 2018)\n* \"*The brutality of this worldwide phenomenon becomes all the more grave and scandalous in the Church, for it is utterly incompatible with her moral authority and ethical credibility. Consecrated persons, chosen by God to guide souls to salvation, let themselves be dominated by their human frailty or sickness and thus become tools of Satan. In abuse, we see the hand of the evil that does not spare even the innocence of children. No explanations suffice for these abuses involving children. We need to recognize with humility and courage that we stand face to face with the mystery of evil, which strikes most violently against the most vulnerable, for they are an image of Jesus. For this reason, the Church has now become increasingly aware of the need not only to curb the gravest cases of abuse by disciplinary measures and civil and canonical processes, but also to decisively confront the phenomenon both inside and outside the Church. She feels called to combat this evil that strikes at the very heart of her mission, which is to preach the Gospel to the little ones and to protect them from ravenous wolves. Here again I would state clearly: if in the Church there should emerge even a single case of abuse – which already in itself represents an atrocity – that case will be faced with the utmost seriousness. Brothers and Sisters: in people’s justified anger, the Church sees the reflection of the wrath of God, betrayed and insulted by these deceitful consecrated persons. The echo of the silent cry of the little ones who, instead of finding in them fathers and spiritual guides encountered tormentors, will shake hearts dulled by hypocrisy and by power. It is our duty to pay close heed to this silent, choked cry. It is difficult to grasp the phenomenon of the sexual abuse of minors without considering power, since it is always the result of an abuse of power, an exploitation of the inferiority and vulnerability of the abused, which makes possible the manipulation of their conscience...Before all this cruelty, all this idolatrous sacrifice of children to the god of power, money, pride and arrogance, empirical explanations alone are not sufficient. They fail to make us grasp the breadth and depth of this tragedy...So what would be the existential “meaning” of this criminal phenomenon? In the light of its human breadth and depth, it is none other than the present-day manifestation of the spirit of evil. If we fail to take account of this dimension, we will remain far from the truth and lack real solutions*\"(Address to the Protection of Minors in the Church, 2019)\n* \"*In response to cases of sexual abuse committed by members of the Church, its not enough to ask for forgiveness. Asking for forgiveness is necessary but not enough. Asking for forgiveness is good for the victims. But they are the ones who have to be at the centre of everything. Their pain and psychological wounds can begin to heal if they find answers, if there is concrete action to repair the horrors they have suffered, and to prevent them from happening again. The Church cannot try to hide the tragedy of abuse of any kind....The Church must serve as a model to solve these issues and bring it to light in society and families. The Church must offer safe spaces for victims to be heard, supported psychologically and protected. Let us pray for those who have suffered because of the wrongs done to them from members of the Church; may they find within the Church herself a concrete response to their pain and suffering*\"(Prayer Intention, March 2023)\n* \"*The best results and the most effective resolution that we can offer to the victims, to the People of Holy Mother Church and to the entire world, are the commitment to personal and collective conversion, the humility of learning, listening, assisting and protecting the most vulnerable. I make a heartfelt appeal for an all-out battle against the abuse of minors both sexually and in other areas, on the part of all authorities and individuals, for we are dealing with abominable crimes that must be erased from the face of the earth: this is demanded by all the many victims hidden in families and in the various settings of our societies*.\"(Address to the Protection of Minors in the Church, 2019)",

First, the decline of the Church of England:\n\n* Just 15% of Britons consider themselves Anglican, down from 30% in 2000\n\n* 10% consider themselves Catholic, a figure relatively stable over the last few decades\n\n* Those practicing a non-Christian religion are up to 6% of the population \n\nSecond, the figures are being driven by a **complete collapse** in religion amongst young people:\n\n* More than 7 in 10 (71%!) of 18-24 year old Britons say they have no religion \n\n* Just 3% of young people are Anglican, compared to 40% of those 75+\n\n* 60% of those 65-74 are practicing a religion, and that number rises to 73% amongst those 75+, so you can see how wide the gap is between the older generations and the new",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/11pegjh/pope_francis_is_saying_nothing_newpart_1_papal/",
        "text": "I thought I would do a series of posts called \"Pope Francis is saying nothing new\". The reason being is that often times there is a significant amount of confusion in terms of Pope Francis's beliefs and perspectives. People think that he is either \"changing the Catholic Church's teachings\" or that he's just trying to \"give the appearance of being progressive\" to fit a modern age. Both are false. He sees himself as building off previous social teachings that have already been there, particularly social justice teachings. What I'm going to do in these series of posts is first post quotes that show the precedents in Catholic and Christian history that the Pope is drawing from. Then I will compare these with quotes from the Pope himself. The first focus of this discussion is going to be on the rights of indigenous peoples. This got a lot of attention in the global and North American press due to Canadian residential schools, the genocidal impact there. Many saw this as a \"new and ground breaking\" moment that was unprecedented. As will be shown though, that is true and not true. Because there is precedent in the history of the Catholic Church for defending the rights of indigenous peoples:\n\n**Papal and theological precedent:**\n\n* \"*I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. In order to make your sins known to you I have mounted this pulpit, I who am the voice of Christ crying in the wilderness of this island; and therefore it behooves you to listen to me, not with indifference but with all your heart and senses; for this voice will be the strangest, the harshest and hardest, the most terrifying that you ever heard or expected to hear….This voice declares that you are in mortal sin, and live and die therein by reason of the cruelty and tyranny that you practice on these innocent people. Tell me, by what right or justice do you hold these indigenous people in such cruel and horrible slavery? By what right do you wage such detestable wars on these people who lived mildly and peacefully in their own lands, where you have consumed infinite numbers of them with unheard of murders and desolations? Why do you so greatly oppress and fatigue them, not giving them enough to eat or caring for them when they fall ill from excessive labors, so that they die or rather are slain by you, so that you may extract and acquire gold every day*?\"\\_Fr Antonio De Montesinos(Advent Sermon, 1511)\n* \"*The reader may ask himself if this is not cruelty and injustice of a kind so terrible that it beggars the imagination, and whether these poor*\\*(indigenous)\\* *people would not fare far better if they were entrusted to the devils in Hell than they do at the hands of the devils of the New World who masquerade as Christians*\"\\_Fr Bartolome De Las Casas(On the Destruction of the Indies, 1542)\n* “*I leave in the Indies Jesus Christ, our God, scourged and afflicted and beaten and crucified not once, but thousands of times*.\"\\_Fr Bartolome De Las Casas(History of the Indies, 1566)\n* \"*The enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in order to bring men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never before heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God’s word of Salvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to please him, have not hesitated to publish abroad that the indigenous people of the West and the South, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated as dumb brutes created for our service....Desiring to provide ample remedy for these evils, We define and declare by these Our letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary public and sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical dignitary, to which the same credit shall be given as to the originals, that, notwithstanding whatever may have been or may be said to the contrary, the said indigenous people and all other people who may later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, even though they be outside the faith of Jesus Christ; and that they may and should, freely and legitimately, enjoy their liberty and the possession of their property; nor should they be in any way enslaved; should the contrary happen, it shall be null and have no effect*.\"\\_Pope Paul III(Sublimus Dei, 1537)\n* \"*It is asked: Whether it is permitted to capture by force and deceit Blacks and other indigenous people who have harmed no one? Answer: no. Whether it is permitted to buy, sell or make contracts in their respect Blacks and other indigenous people who have harmed no one and been made captives by force or deceit? Answer: no. Whether the possessors of Blacks and other indigenous people who have harmed no one and been captured by force or deceit, are not held to set them free? Answer: yes. Whether the captors, buyers and possessors of Blacks and other indigenous people who have harmed no one and who have been captured by force or deceit are not held to make compensation to them? Answer: yes*.\"\\_Congregation of the Holy Office(1686)\n* \"*\\[We condemn and declare guilty of grave crime whosoever\\] shall dare or presume to reduce the said Indigenous people to slavery, to sell them, to buy them, to exchange or give them, to separate them from their wives and children, to deprive them of goods and chattels, to transport or send them to other places, or in any way whatsoever to rob them of freedom and hold them in slavery; or to give counsel, help, favor, and work on any pretext of color to them that do these things, or to preach or teach that it is lawful, or to co-operate therewith in any way whatever*.\"\\_Pope Benedict XIV(Immensa Pastorum, 1741)\n* \"*Though much has thus been done for the Indians, there is much more that still remains to be done. And, indeed, when we consider the crimes and outrages still committed against them, our heart is filled with horror, and we are moved to great compassion for its most unhappy race. For what can be so cruel and so barbarous as to scourge men and brand them with hot iron, often for most trivial causes, often for a mere lust of cruelty; or, having suddenly overthrown them, to slay hundreds or thousands in one unceasing massacre; or to waste villages and districts and slaughter the inhabitants, so that some tribes, as we understand, have become extinct in these last few years? The lust of lucre has done much to make the minds of men so barbarous. But something also is due to the nature of the climate and the situation of these regions. For, as these places are subjected to burning southern sun, which casts a languor into the veins and as it were, destroys the vigor of virtue, and as they are far removed from the habits of religion and the vigilance of the State, and in a measure even from civil society, it easily comes to pass that those who have not already come there with evil morals soon begin to be corrupted, and then, when all bonds of right and duty are broken, they fall away into all hateful vices. Nor in this do they take any pity on the weakness of sex or age, so that we are ashamed to mention the crimes and outrages they commit in seeking out and selling women and children, wherein it may be truly said that they have surpassed the worst examples of pagan iniquity*.\"\\_Pope Pius X(Lacrimabili Statu, 1912)\n* \"*We particularly urge you to foster and promote all the good works instituted in your dioceses for the benefit of the indigenous people, and to see that other works likely to contribute to this end may be instituted....Do you, moreover, take care that wheresoever moral instruction is given, in seminaries, in colleges, in convent schools, and more especially in the churches, Christian charity, which holds all men, without distinction of nation or color, as true brethren, shall be continually preached and commended. And this charity must be made manifest not so much by words as by deeds. Moreover, every opportunity must be taken to show what a great dishonor is done to the Christian name by these base deeds, which we are here denouncing*\"\\_Pope Pius X(Lacrimabili Statu, 1912)\n\nSo this is the theological and Papal precedence for the defense of the rights of indigenous communities. I could have drawn from many other sources but that would make this OP far too long. Suffice to say when it comes to the Catholic Church's relationship with indigenous peoples since 1492 there has always been what I consider to be two tracks(this could apply to Christian Churches in general). Track 1 is what I call the \"imperial track\". Basically an imperial and domineering approach to Christianity that sought to subjugate indigenous people and erase their culture. The roots of this are in the Doctrine of Discovery, the \"spiritual conquest of indigenous people\", residential schools and other abuses. Then there is the \"prophetic track\". This track resists the exploitation and oppression of indigenous communities. We see this in figures like Las Casas, Pope Paul III, Pope Pius X and the Latin American theologians of the modern era who played prominent roles in resisting genocidal policies in places like Guatemala during the civil war and Peru in the 90s. Both have existed side by side for 500 there. Francis has taken the prophet tract as his precedent. These are his perspectives in quotes:\n\n* \"*Indigenous peoples for example are not opposed to progress, yet theirs is a different notion of progress, often more humanistic than the modern culture of developed peoples. Theirs is not a culture meant to benefit the powerful, those driven to create for themselves a kind of earthly paradise. Intolerance and lack of respect for indigenous popular cultures is a form of violence grounded in a cold and judgemental way of viewing them. No authentic, profound and enduring change is possible unless it starts from the different cultures, particularly those of the poor*\"(Fratelli Tuti, prg 220)\n* \"*It is essential to show special for indigenous communities and their cultural traditions. They are not merely one minority among others but should be the principal dialogue partners, especially when large projects affecting their land are proposed. For them, land is not a commodity but rather a gift from God and from their ancestors who rest there, a sacred space with which they need to interact if they are to maintain their identity and values. When they remain on their land, they themselves care for it best. Nevertheless in various parts of the world, the pressure is being put on them to abandon their homelands to make room for agricultural or mining projects which are undertaken without regard for the degradation of nature and culture*\"(Laudato Si, prg 146)\n* \"*We need to feel outrage as Moses did(Ex 11:8) and as Jesus did(Mk 3:5) as God does in the face of injustice(Am 2:4-8; 5:7-12; Ps 106:40). It is not good for us to become inured to evil; it is not good when our social consciousness is dulled before and exploitation that is leaving destruction throughout our region....jeopardizing the lives of millions of people and especially the habitat of peasants and indigenous peoples. The incidents of injustice and cruelty that took place in the Amazon region even in the last century ought to provoke profound abhorrence, but they should also make us more sensitive to the need to acknowledge current forms of human exploitation, abuse and killing*\"(Querida Amazonia, prg 15)\n* \"*The businesses, national, or international which harm the Amazon and fail to respect the right of the indigenous peoples to the land and its boundaries, and to self determination and prior consent should be called for what they are: injustice and crime. When certain businesses out for quit profit appropriate land and end up privatizing even potable water, or when local authorities give free access to the timber companies, mining or oil projects, and other businesses that raze the forests and pollute the environment, economic relationships are unduly altered and become and instrument of death*\"(Querida Amazonia, prg 14)\n* \"*I would like to point out that a consumerist vision of human beings, encouraged by the mechanisms of today's globalized economy, have a leveling effect on cultures, diminishing the immense variety which is the heritage of all humanity. This especially affects young people, for it has a tendency to blur what is distinctive about their origins and backgrounds and turn them into a new line of malleable goods....I urge the young people of the Amazon region, especially indigenous peoples, to take charge of your roots, because from the roots comes the strength that will make you grow, flourish and bear fruit*\"(Querida Amazonia, prg 33)\n* \"*Let us say NO, then, to forms of colonialism old and new. Let us say YES to the encounter between peoples and cultures. Blessed are the peacemakers. Here I wish to bring up an important issue. Some may rightly say, “When the Pope speaks of colonialism, he overlooks certain actions of the Church”. I say this to you with regret: many grave sins were committed against the native peoples of America in the name of God...I ask that the Church...kneel before God and implore forgiveness for the past and present sins of her sons and daughters”..I humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offenses of the Church herself, but also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America. Together with this request for forgiveness and in order to be just, I also would like us to remember the thousands of priests and bishops who strongly opposed the logic of the sword with the power of the Cross. There was sin, a great deal of it, for which we did not ask pardon. So for this, we ask forgiveness, I ask forgiveness. But here also, where there was sin, great sin, grace abounded through the men and women who defended the rights of indigenous peoples*\"(World Meeting of Popular Movements, 2015)\n* \"*At this time in Latin America and the Caribbean, the so often silenced cry of women who are subjected to many forms of exclusion and violence in all their forms and at all stages of their lives must be heard. Among them, poor, indigenous and Afro-American women have endured double marginalization. All women must be able to participate fully in ecclesial, family, cultural, social, and economic life, with the creation of spaces and structures to foster greater inclusion*\"(Aparecida Conference, prg 454)\n* \"*Today, more than ever, there are many who demand a process of reconversion of the consolidated power structures that underpin the societies of western culture; these, at the same time, transform the historical relations marked by colonialism, exclusion and discrimination, giving rise to a renewed dialogue on the way in which we are building our future on the planet. We urgently need joint action, the fruit of sincere and constant collaboration, because the environmental challenge we are experiencing and its human roots have an impact on every one of us. Not only a physical impact, but also psychological and cultural. Therefore, I ask governments to recognize the Indigenous Peoples of the whole world, with their cultures, languages, traditions and spirituality, and to respect their dignity and their rights, in the knowledge that the richness of our great human family consists precisely in its diversity. Ignoring Indigenous communities in protecting the earth is a grave error — it is extractive functionalism — not to mention a great injustice....Aboriginal cultures are not there to be transformed into a modern culture, no. They are there to be respected. \\[We must consider\\] two things: firstly, letting them follow their path of development and, secondly, listening to the messages of wisdom they give us. Because it is not an encyclopaedic wisdom. It is the wisdom of seeing, listening to and touching daily life. Continue to fight to proclaim this harmony, because this functionalist policy, this policy of extractivism, is destroying it. And may we all be able to learn from this living well in the harmonious sense of Indigenous Peoples*.\"(To Participants in Indigenous Peoples Forum, 2023)",

        "text": "For me when god mentioned punishment in the hill fire, I don’t scare that much but one phrase stoped me the most, when god says to people in the hill fire, they are trying to say to him they are sorry and make excuse to let them go back to follow his guidance, god used the past verb to describe how they look like , even the seen not happens yet . He says don’t make excuses now , because I warned you about those punishment ,  and I told you my decision  will not change . The god already saw the seen before it happens. As a Muslim this scared me the most and always when I do mistake , I go back to him . As humans, we need to be scared to win paradise because if we are not scared, we will follow our desire and will end up in the worse place ever.",
