Senator Hirono quietly, doggedly, continues to fight for equality and for the betterment of everyone.

        "text": "I haven't seen them for a long while, I met one, Laura through the hardcore punk scene in Durham UK, and her friend Lisa by proxy. They were really cool people. We got along great. We've all gone our separate ways now, but we used to have really good, in-depth conversations about what equality means, and what it really means to be free. Just like any answer-searching late teen-early 20 somethings who do. \n\nI'm a white male, my mamma was a punk, so I got raised punk too. That's why I was at the punk show in the first place. When I was growing up I was surrounded constantly by the music of Penetration, Siouxie and The Banshees, The Slits... I grew up with the \"Fuck everyone else, do it for yourself.\" Ideology and I think I've turned out pretty much okay. I graduated uni with an Education Studies degree and am currently self employed as a lecturer of Health and Social Care. I've always been a big supporter of unions/cooperatives/local trade and fixing things instead of buying them where I can. I am trying to pass down that ideology to my son.\n\nBasically, my point is this... I remember a conversation I had with my feminist friends a few years ago and I said something to the tune of \"Feminists have the punk attitude. They do shit for themselves. They know everyone is being oppressed by the establishment and they aren't afraid to say 'No'. Everyone except the elite gets oppressed, feminism highlights the bigger issue.\" \n\nTo which my friends, at the time, agreed. They also said I had the roots in my ideology as a feminist thinker, but I don't really think I belonged there. I really don't know what kind of politics I follow. I dont like to make my mind up without listening to a situation, but I do vote Labour. \n\nAnyway, that conversation was about 9 years ago. \n\nMore recently, I had a similar conversation with a 17-18 year old feminist activist at a punk gig. I like meeting people who have the energy and conviction to do what they want to do, and because I'm from the North I always speak to people I don't know. Anyhow, before I could even say \"Hello! Where are you from? Nice to meet you! Cool Cramps teeshirt!\", she told me in very plain terms that because I'm a male, I shouldn't have started talking to her without her permission. And that I oppressed her by doing so. Also, that I am a \"Potential threat to her\".\n\nI was mortified. I have never seen anyone so upset by a simple bit of networking, which is what the punk scene is built on. I left that conversation feeling guilty that she'd reacted so badly, but I didn't feel ashamed by anything I did because I really felt I did nothing to slight her at all. Everyone has bad days, she must have been having one too. I even thought to myself at the time that Laura and Lisa would tell that lass to fuck off if they were there.\n\nIve heard a lot of stories similar to this. Has the general concensus of feminism shifted in the last 9 years? And if so is that in reaction to the alt right? Or am I just a fucking 31 year old cis-fossil who could never really understand it because I am , and always will be a white male. Or am I missing something here?\n \n\n",

        "text": "\\[DISCLAIMER: while I have a lot of respect for Ms. Blasey Ford's courage and a lot of faith in her credibility, this post is NOT my attempt to get into a political rigmarole or convince anyone of Kavanaugh's guilt, rather just looking for personal advice\\]\n\nLike many women out there, I have experienced sexual assault in various forms pretty much beginning at puberty. Like many humans out there, I am a consistent consumer of multiple news sources and podcasts in the age of Trump and #MeToo, which means that I am nearly constantly inundated with the accounts of others' sexual assaults. While this can be grating, infuriating and generally emotionally draining, I am privileged enough to have worked through my trauma in therapy and the mention of these kinds of triggers doesn't impede my daily life. Usually. \n\nThe story of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh has struck an especial cord with me. As a young teenager, I experienced a situation very very similar to that which she describes and the memories have been brought to the forefront of my imagination, memories which I've managed not to recall in a long time. I think that which is haunting me the most out of the whole situation is that, despite the raw and intense panic, fear and violation I felt, I wrote the incident off as normal. As \"boys being boys\". It never even occurred to me at the time to tell a figure of authority because I knew they could have easily passed it off as all in good spirited fun, as a joke simply gone a step too far. In fact, I was worried about being seen as overly-sensitive or uncool; what would they be charged with? *Almost* rape? And it hurts my heart to know that my 13-year-old self decided that these experiences were just par for the course of growing boobs. That I could have an experience so similar to Ford's, so many years after hers, and be convinced that it was normal is disheartening. Then to compare that to the present, and the public reception of her claims, I wonder if we are regressing entirely. \n\n Anyway, the stories have been weighing heavy on me recently and I decided to try and talk to my boyfriend about them. We've had conversations about a previous, unrelated sexual assault and he has always been more than supportive. He, somehow, has managed to avoid the news and so I began a quick run-down; her description of events, her letter to Diane Feinstein and the negotiations of her testimony before the Senate. Before I could finish, he interrupted me saying that it was obviously \"complete bullshit\", that she's bringing up something from 35 years ago and only trying to sabotage a man she sees \"doing well for himself\". After these comments I was at a literal loss for words for a good minute but when he said \"I know this isn't what you wanted to hear, but...\" I cut him off. I told him the conversation was over, that I was going to try and talk to him about something personal but that was no longer possible. I politely said good night and hung up the phone. \n\nTL;DR: Try to confess a sexual assault to my partner in the context of the Blasey Ford allegations, he interrupts me saying that all her claims are obviously made up. \n\nSo what do I do now? How do I bare my own sexual assault to a man (the one I love) who has jumped on the opportunity to discredit another's? \n\nCONTEXT: We're both 23 and have been together for about 2 years, the past few months of which have been long-distance. Any other time I've spoken to him about topics like this, he's only shown the most empathy, so this is surprising for me. He's not politically affiliated and he's definitely a moderate. ",
