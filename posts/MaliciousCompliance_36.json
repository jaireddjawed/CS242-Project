        "text": "Just to preface, this malicious compliance didn't lose her the store, but it didn't help either.\n\nA few years ago, I worked for my college bookstore. It was great, at first, but then Idiot started working there. Idiot was not prepared to manage the store. She hired 5 people to stock, cashier, work the floor, etc., instead of two. She blew through her entire payroll budget in less than 6 months. Someone came from the main office to help her learn the ropes, and she learned nothing. She even had me do her daily reports (that I shouldn't have been allowed to do it AT ALL), and she *never* learned how to do them.\n\nShe was super lazy and just bad at her job. The reason she blew through her payroll budget is that she didn't want to be on the floor at all.\n\nAnyway, I asked her in March if I would be working or not (so I would have time to look for summer work), and she told me that I would be working all summer. I had just moved out of my parents house, so I really needed the money. May rolls around, and she tells me she can't have me for a single day. I was mad, and panicky, but I figured it out and moved out just fine.\n\nIn August, I come back with a sprained toe. It was really, visibly bad. My toe was entirely bruised. I asked her if I could work on the daily reports, which involved sitting. She said that she needed me up front, on the register. I asked if I could sit on a stool, as standing hurt. She said that was unprofessional, and that I *had* to stand.\n\n(Just a little note here, I didn't get sick pay at this job, but if someone called in sick, the company policy was to let them go for one day without questions. After that, you could start to ask what was up, maybe request a doctor's note.)\n\nMC #1: I faked a cough, and said, \"I'm sorry, Idiot, I'm too sick to work. I think I'm gonna go home.\"\n\nShe immediately started to backtrack, and she said I could sit on the stool if I needed to, but I decided it hurt too much to work. I had thrown the real rules in her face (there was no rule against sitting at the register), and she had to let me go home. She was stuck on the floor all day.\n\nThe next day I worked, I looked at the schedule, and I had no shifts beyond that day. She had even taken my name off the schedule. It was frustrating and petty as hell. I found out later that she thought I \"talked too much.\" I was a god damn cashier. It's my job to talk to people.\n\nIt didn't get to me for long though, since I was already done with the bs of the job. I was back in school, so I didn't really need the money (student loans), and I was starting my thesis. I decided enough was enough.\n\nMC #2: Toward the end of my shift, I requested a meeting with Idiot and the assistant manager (AM) (who had been telling me I should escape asap. AM was cool). Idiot told me that she couldn't have me working often, but that I could come in once a month to do the daily reports (ew no). I told Idiot that I was giving my two weeks notice, as I had school work to do. It was pretty clear she wanted me gone, so she wholeheartedly agreed. As I got up to leave, she started to ask me when I could teach her how to do the daily reports. I told her that I was sorry, but I was not scheduled to work the next two weeks. In fact, I wasn't scheduled at all.\n\nYou are not allowed to change an employee's schedule after they give their two weeks. Her face blanched, and she realized she had screwed herself. I could report her to upper management for all the bs she was pulling (more than mentioned here). She was stuck. I walked out of there feeling free. \n\nLater, I found out from AM that the store had gone to shit without me. Apparently, Idiot wasn't really friendly, nor was she good at customer service. People used to come in the store specifically to talk to me, and then they would buy something for wasting my time. Sales went down. She started letting people go, and sales kept going down. She didn't do the daily reports for so long that someone from corporate had to come and do them for her. I found out in January (five months later) that the corporate office decided to close the location. She was out of a job, and they weren't looking to hire her back into the company. I don't know what happened to Idiot after that.\n\n**TL;DR:** Idiot boss takes over, makes a bunch of mistakes, and I help cover her ass. She repays me by trying to force me to work through an injury. I throw the rules in her face, and she stops giving me shifts. I decide that if she doesn't want me to work there, I should move on. She screws herself over so hard, the store gets closed and she loses her job.\n\n**Edit:** The policy against changing someone's schedule from their two weeks notice was a company policy. Idk why they had it, but it was helpful to me.",

Sure, they got to go through the buffet line first, but apparently stuffing your face and getting the silverware-on-glass tinkling signal to kiss for your audience has to stop!\n\nNow it had been a long day in the heat and without food or drink, so our bride and groom were HAWNGREE and the people wouldn't stop ringing their drink-a-links to get the lovebirds to make out. And the pair were getting annoyed. Annoyed as only lovebirds can get when they have had no food and no drink for too long on this, the day of their wedding.\n\nSo they're tucking in - again - after another interruption, and while I am sure they would never tire of sucking face, they wanted the chance to eat like everyone else does. What happens? I'll tell you.\n\nThose glasses go ting-ting-a-ling and the groom and the bride stand up from their plates, and you can see it on their faces: they're tired. It has been a long day. They're hungry, they are thirsty, they just want an uninterrupted meal. So what do they do?\n\nWell, dear reader, they do what the audience wants: they go to TOWN on each other. I'm talking necking, tongue, the WORKS, ladies and gentlemen. Gasps from the crowd! Mothers covered their children's eyes! The bride's father hid his face behind the tablecloth, unable to bear the sight any longer.\n\nAnd do you know what? It worked.\n\nI don't think I heard a ting-ting-a-ling the rest of the evening.\n\nThank you ladies and gents and everyone in between you've been a wonderful audience.",

        "text": "I manage a doctor's office that is a specialty practice.  We understand that patients have things come up or can forget appointments, but we were having a problem with patients \"no-showing\" for their appointments or coming very late (over 15 minutes).  Over my tenure at this office, we implemented a $25 no-show/same day cancellation fee, and we also will refuse to see patients that are more than 15 minutes late.  While this is applied to all patients who do not call/cancel within 24 hours or are more than 15 min late, I have given my staff full discretion to waive the fee or work the patient in if there are extenuating circumstances.  People do end up in the hospital, cars do break down, etc.  \n\nSide note:  yes.  I know.  Going to the doctor sucks because you are there forever (except my specialty.  If you are at my office forever, something has gone horribly wrong somewhere.)  Please keep in mind that, in my experience at least, doctors aren't running behind because they are chitchatting with sales reps or planning their next golf trip.  Usually it's because a procedure didn't go exactly as planned, a patient worked in with a minor problem actually had a major problem, a patient got bad news and the appointment is taking longer, or the fine balance between being booked and being overbooked is off.  \n\nStory continued:  \nLast year, our darling patient, Susie*, ran late for her appointment.  This was the 5th time she was late for her appointment within the last few months.  She had been warned about the possibility she could be turned away if she continued to be late.  She ignored said warnings.  \n\nThis particular appointment, she showed up and her physician had already left for the day.  Susie was pissed.  How dare her physician not hang around after working hours to see if Susie deigns our office worthy of her presence?  Susie then proceeds to berate my receptionist about how awful our office is, how we NEVER accommodate her, and how she \"works in the medical field\".  \"I see patients too!  I can't just LEAVE when patients are in my office.  I'm never coming back here again!  You are just awful people.\"\n\nOh.  Ok.  You are late because you didn't have the foresight to schedule fewer patients or take an hour off, and this is the 5th time you have been late recentyly.  It's our fault because we are awful and you are firing us.  Sure.  Got it.  We document the conversation. \n (second side note:  your doctor's office documents EVERYTHING.  Call the receptionist a bitch?  Act like an asshole to the phone nurse?  It's documented somewhere and your doctor knows about it.)  \n\nAs our protocol, when we terminate a patient from the practice or we are fired by a patient, we send a letter.  Hers was something like:  Dear Susie.  So sorry you hate us.  You can contact your insurance company or local Medical Specialty Society for a list of doctors in your area.  We will happily send your medical record there.  This creates an written notification that we will no longer see the patient.\n\nThat's the end...or is it?\n\nFast forward to today.  I get an urgent message from my operator that Susie is on the line wanting to make an appointment.  What should she do?  I review the chart/notes (&lt;documentation!) and remember what an entitled ass Susie is and tell the operator I'll take the call.\n\nMe:  \"Hi, Susie.  This is PL104-191, the office manager.  I was reviewing the notes on your account and it looks like last year you fired us as your care provider.\"\n\nSusie:  \"Yes, well, my insurance has changed, and now I have to see you.  I don't have a choice.  I need to make an appointment to come in there.  Can I come next Thursday?\"\n\nMe:  \"Oh.  I'm so sorry, Susie. I'm afraid I can't do that.  Once you fire your health care provider and are officially terminated from the practice, you can't be seen there again.  Unfortunately, that means I cannot schedule an appointment for you under any circumstance.\"\n\nSusie:  \"You are JUST AWFUL.  I hate dealing with your office and I am never coming back there anyway! &lt;click&gt;\"\n\nNope.  You sure aren't coming back here.  But don't worry.  If we are the only office that takes your insurance, I'm sure there are plenty of offices that still take cash or credit cards even from entitled bitches.   :)\n\n*Name has been changed because HIPAA.  \n\nTldr:  Patient says we are \"awful\" and never wants to be seen at our office again.  Patient changes her mind because it is more convenient for her.  Patient still can't be seen here because she said she didn't want to be seen here.",

        "text": "So I was just reminded of this by reading the last post by u/SoberApok. \n\nMy old employer switched from written time sheets to a computer system that we had to log into each morning and evening to \"clock in/out\" and of course this system rounded out to the nearest 15 minutes. So naturally if you punched in at 8:07 am it counted as 8am, 8:08 am counted as 8:15. \n\nNow, I was normally pretty punctual but of course we used to count the time we walked into the building but now we would have to wait for the computer to boot up - and as everyone knows, that eats into your time and has nothing to do with what time you actually arrived to work. \n\nSo I began to leave my PC on all night, thus ensuring I wasn't being short-changed. But that's not the end of the story! I'm sure other people were doing  the same thing I was, and sure enough a company-wide memo goes out explaining how important computer updates are normally rolled-out overnight so they can be installed when the PCs booted up. So it was essential that we turn the computers off and re-start them in the morning.\n\nOf course these updates cause even more of a delay before you can clock in. So what did I do? I set my computer to reboot every morning before I got in, giving it plenty of time to install those crucial updates.",

        "text": "20-ish years ago, my second week working in the back office of a hotel as a reservations clerk:\n\nOur hotel was near a convention center so we always got groups of business people coming in from all over the world to attend the conventions. One of my jobs was to fax confirmation papers to them because even though email existed at that point, it was still not a thing we could really utilize for that purpose. \n\n.\n\nEnter our assistant manager, let's call her Ass.Man. Ass.Man had just been promoted to become MANAGER at one of our luxury hotels near Disney World in Florida and she would be leaving in less than two weeks so she was thrilled. And we were all thrilled too because we all hated her. I was new but even I could see what a rude piece of work she was. She was very two-faced, acting one way in front of the managers and another way when she was alone with us. But now that she had her promotion, she felt waaay too comfortable and was letting the mask slide.\n\n.\n\nSo back to my stack of faxes. I found one fax that I was supposed to send to a number that started with 911, I brought it to her attention and told her I was afraid the number was wrong because if I punch it in as-is, the fax machine will call 911. Cue her looking at me in disbelief and with the loudest voice possible:\n\nASS.MAN \"Are you kid-ding me? You think a FAX-MACHINE can call a telephone? IT'S A FAX-MACHINE, NOT A TELEPHONE. WHY ARE YOU SO STUPID? HOW DID YOU GET THIS JOB? Did you really graduate college? On your resume you put you did, didn't you? Well, I can just go and call and check, because I think in COH-LEDGE they should teach you that you can't make PHONE CALLS with FAX-MACHINES.\" (Of course I'm paraphrasing but that was the gist of it, and she did this in front of all 4 coworkers in the back office, minus the actual manager.)\n\nMe - \"Yes... But... I really think it's gonna call 911 though.\"\n\nHer - \"Just do your job, okay??\" and then she waved me off with a dismissive hand-flap.\n\n.\n\nSo everyone (besides her, she's willfully ignoring me now) stops to watch anxiously as I punch in the number into the fax machine. I punch 9-1-1 and before I can punch anything else the fax machine makes a beep-boop-beep-beep noise and all of a sudden we hear a crackling metallic muffled \"911 what's your emergency?\" SO I freaked out, smashed my fingers on all the buttons to try to hang up and finally managed it. Everyone in the office started freaking out \"OMG you called 911, they're gonna come here! OMG you could go to jail for crank-calling 911! OMG! OMG!\"\n\n.\n\nASS.MAN stands up and says \"Well, they don't know the call came from here so just calm down!\" and snatched the paper away from me. \"Just keep doing all the other ones, I'll figure this one out later.\" After that she decided it was her lunch break and walked off.\n\n10 minutes later, the police arrived, catching the front desk by surprise. The cops assumed that someone had called 911 from one of the hotel roomss and spread out to check each room one by one. We were too terrified in the back office to confess it was the fax machine so we all just sat there sweating like actual criminals until our manager walked in. One of the girls cracked and confessed what really happened. How ASS.MAN forced me to fax 911 through the fax machine and yelled at me.\n\n.\n\nThe cops finally left and ASS.MAN came back from lunch. Our manager called her into his office and with the door wide open for us to hear every juicy detail he chewed her open a new asshole about what had happened while she was gone. He told her to forget about the promotion, she wouldn't be going anywhere and that he'd be taking up her promotion under review.\n\nThis was hilarious because she had already bought the plane ticket and made the moving arrangements and the rental arrangements and roommate arrangements, she was sooo ready to go!\n\n.\n\nShe still got to go, but the few days he made her wait in suspense while he pretended to \"take the promotion under review\" was priceless. She left the office in tears that day and would not look any of us in the eye. The days after that, she was barely in the office.\n\nOh, and the 911 thing? It was an area code from India. I was supposed to put a country code in front of it. All the country code stuff hung on a large sheet in the manager's office, if she'd only paid attention. WHoops!\n\n.\n\n(Sorry I added some . to prevent it from getting too wall-of-text-ish.)",

        "text": "So, after posting a story about radio protocol yesterday, I've started to dredge up other memories about that company. Ohhhh boy did that company have some crazy issues.\n\nAnyway, I worked for this nationwide ambulance company. Being nationwide, we had our payroll department located out of state. We were hourly employees. When you got to the station every morning, you would walk into the lobby, pick up this phone, dial payroll, then dial in your employee number. \n\nCorporate decided at one point to 'streamline' the process. On the old system, you would be recorded the moment you clocked in. Clock in at 6:55, you started getting paid at 6:55.\n\nHowever, the change was this. I'm sure it made bookkeeping easier, but they introduced a rounding system. They would round you to the quarter of an hour you were closest to. So, clocking in at 6:50 meant you started getting paid at 6:45. Clocking in at 6:55 meant you started getting paid at 7:00.\n\nI'm sure everyone can see how this can both screw the employees, but also how it can be exploited.\n\nWe had three supervisors at the time. B, E, and A. B was pretty laid back, but still followed most of the rules. E was a typical stick in the mud boss. VERY hard working guy, but no wiggle room in rules. A was the best of both worlds. He just wanted the problem solved, no matter what it was or what it took. \n\nNow, 'standard protocol' is of course to actually clock in or out when you get there or when you leave. After the new system, it wasn't long before pretty much every employee would hang around and clock out when they could get the maximum value out of rounding, of course. When no boss was around.\n\nOne day, I was finishing my shift, and A was in the lobby with me. I was done, A knew it, and I looked at the clock. 7:06. Damn.\n\nI reached over and picked up the phone. \n\n\"What in the HELL are you doing?!?\" A yelled. I jumped. I hadn't ever heard him yell before. \n\n\"Uhh..clocking out?\" I said.\n\n\"Hang up that goddamn phone and wait two minutes!\" I blinked at him.\n\n\"Umm....you don't care?\"\n\n\"Hey, they make the rules, not me.\" A smiled. \"If they want to give you all more money for nothing, fine by me.\"\n\nI miss him. Coolest boss ever. ",

        "text": "This happened a couple of years ago, at the restaurant where I worked at the time.\n\nI have always been a very hard worker, going above and beyond the call of duty, as it were. The customers always talked about how great I am at my job;  the big boss liked how much I pitched in for extra tasks; most of my co-workers liked that I would do the weird tasks that never seemed to get done otherwise. I would do these in random down time throughout the day. No reservations for the first half hour of service today? I'll spend 30 minutes restocking, reorganizing shelves, taking those random things to storage, etc. \n\nEveryone was happy with this. Except TT. TT was convinced that I not only hated her, but that I was personally out to get her fired for it. While I didn't particularly care for her personally, she mostly did her job, so I really couldn't be bothered to give her a second thought. \n\nOne day, however, TT decided she had had enough of me not doing the things I should be doing (according to her). All those extra things just weren't important, and I should stop doing them, and instead focus on only the immediate needs. I guess so that she could go home earlier. We had an \"everybody leaves together\" policy. This meant we were all really good at helping out and getting things done in a reasonable amount of time at the end of the night. None of the extra things I did happened at the end of the night, because I wanted to go home, too. She didn't see it that way.\n\nIt wouldn't have mattered to me at all, since TT was in no way a supervisor, manager, or in any authority whatsoever. However, she went to the (incompetent) manager and complained that I wasn't doing my fair share. This was a total lie, but since IM didn't know anything about what really was happening on the floor, she believed TT, despite TT having been in trouble many times before with other managers for lying, and for not pulling her weight.  This led to a new policy. There had always been a sidework list, complete with names, but we always used it more as a reminder to not forget anything than as a \"this must be done by this person\" list. Not anymore. Now we had to follow it to the letter, and once your list was done, you were free to go. I, along with the rest of the staff,  was annoyed by this, since it seemed so petty.\n\nI started doing only the things on the list, to the letter. Restocking wasn't on the list, since it wasn't an end of shift duty. I was watchful, and I began to use the last of everything just before TT would need it. She was amazed at how many more trips to the stockroom she was suddenly taking. Everyone else could see what was happening, and found it hilarious. They joined in.\n\nOne night, about a week later, TT wanted to leave earlier than the rest of us so she could get to her date. Normally, this would be no problem. Someone could do the sidework that can get done early, and the rest of us pick up the slack later on. So TT did what we had always done. There was a catch, though. She was doing my assigned work. By the time my last table had left, my sidework was done. I cleared it with my immediate supervisor, who confirmed my list was done, and I left.\n\nWhen I got to work the next day, I was told by my co-workers that TT had been incredibly angry with me, cursing and yelling, and throwing things angry. She had tried to get the supervisor to let her go, but lo and behold, her list wasn't complete! She tried to say we had switched, but everybody confirmed that no conversation had taken place between us. Since she hadn't even started on her own list, and she had to clean up her mess from throwing things, it took her almost another hour to complete her job. I would have been happy to switch with her had she chosen to handle any of this like the 26 year old \"adult\" she was, but she chose to take it out of our hands.\n\nShe went back to IM to complain, but everybody confirmed that I did exactly what I was told to- make sure my list was complete.\n\nWe were back to the old way the next week.\n\n",

        "text": "So this was a few years ago when I was working shoes in retail. We were one of the largest stores in the company, so we were pressed for space. Meanwhile smaller stores had blank shelves all over the place. To make it look more occupied they had us put out pairs of shoes instead of just the right shoe. **We already had a theft problem putting out just the one shoe.** This was going to mean a lot of work for me, and not just a one or two day job. This was going to be a two week process. So I fought tooth and nail to not do it.\n\nFinally I said fuck it. I will show them I'm right. I put out Uggs first. Two reasons:\n\nA medium sized table with 30 pairs of Uggs cluttering it cannot look good no matter how you merchandise them.\n\nThese started to be stolen **left and right.** No pun intended.\n\nEvery two days I took a large trash bag of stolen shoe boxes to loss prevention. Specifically when the regional LP boss was in the store. We had 8 or 9 other brands that averaged $200+ (Frye, Antelope, Donald Pliner, Kate Spade, etc) that I put out next, which of course, were stolen as well.",

        "text": "I worked as customer service/signal person for 4 years at a train station  when I was in my early twenties. Every night at midnight we had to change the security video for the next 24 hours to record. There were 31 videos and these would be rotated but the numbers on the video didnt match the date events were recorded so things were sometimes confusing. We had a log keeping track of which video recorded which dates events.  Unless there was a request for a video to be held, it would eventually get taped over during the following month.\n\n\nWe recieved a  fax requesting a video for such and such date. Let's say the 6th of May. Check the log and send the video up the train line to head of security. A few days later we get another fax saying it was the incorect video so check the log again, see that no, it was the correct video for the 6th of May but since they're saying it's wrong video, I send up the 7th of May video thinking that perhaps they got the dates wrong. \n\nA few days later We then get a phone call saying this too is the wrong video as it's the 7th of May and they need the 6th. So again, send up the 6th and a few days later get another message saying it's the wrong video.\nThis went back and forth for a while, each time one of us station staff explaining the 6th of May video had already been sent only to be told it was the wrong video.  \n\nI'm not sure what my workmates did but I kept trying other videos from around the same period- the 4th  5th and so forth- and the security guy is getting more and more irate each time he contacts us but still wont accept that the original video was from the date he requested and that subsequently we've sent videos from that entire week and he still claims to have not recieved the correct tape.\n\n\nBy now we're reaching the end of the month so I know whatever he is looking for on the said video it will soon be taped over in the following weeks.  I had been made redundant and was on my last day of the job when the station recieved yet another fax from security guy (he'd given up calling by then) demanding the video from the 6th of May and using a whole heap of abusive language to try to make his point.  I read over the fax a second time knowing full well I've sent the correct video (and a few others) several times already and so have my workmates.  \n\nGiven it's my last day, I don't really give a shit about his video and certainly didn't appreciate his language so I put the fax at the bottom of the messages pile and enjoyed the rest of my last day. I figured by the time they found the fax they could honestly tell him the video has been taped over and he could go fuck himself. Hopefully whatever he was trying to get from the video wasn't too serious an issue.\n\n\nP.S. if your reading this and aren't familiar with faxes, videos or tapes these things were commonly used back in the olden days when trains ran on steam!",

A VP sat in on the meeting to observe, but any time we'd come up with a suggestion, she'd pipe up and shoot it down. Find a way to work around the pay freeze? \"Sorry, there's nothing we can do.\" Pool table in the lounge to improve morale? \"We're afraid everyone would slack off.\" \\(Really? All 250 employees are going to crowd around the pool table?\\) How about clear paths for career advancement. \"Sometimes, if you want to advance your career, you need to look for another job.\"\n\nI followed her advice and started my job search that night.

        "text": "\n\n\n\nNot sure if this is Malicious Compliance or Petty Revenge...\n\nI graduated uni a few years back and immediately started looking for a job in my chosen field - marketing.\n\nMarketing entry level roles were thin on the ground, so when I found a role which was hybrid of marketing with sales support, I took it. \n\nThe company was a medium sized business which specialised in recruitment, contractor hiring and head hunting. They also subcontracted work for a recruitment technology provider, which matched up perfectly with one of my other passions - technology.  \n\nI absolutely loved the role. I got to do all parts of the marketing and sales lifecycle, I got to work with suppliers, event organisers, clients, staff all across the company, meet new people and do really exciting things. \n\nI had two managers - the one who managed the sales team and the one who managed marketing. \n\nThe marketing manager was a kindred spirit; the sales manager was oldschool sales. An arrogant and headstrong late-forties man who lived for making deals and boasting about them. Shiny shoed, silver-tongued. I’ll call him Dapper Dan. We were not friends. \n\nFor about 18 months, things went swimmingly. I’d do marketing half the time then divide the rest of the time between sales support and billable work. Billable was building custom careers / job sites to host the recruitment system front end. A steep learning curve but with the help of some web dev friends I got pretty familiar with simple site builds. \n\nBeing tech-aligned meant I was always looking digital first, bringing the company into the age of social media, SEO / SEM, website optimisation and multi channel marketing. \n\nDapper Dan sneered at such things. He saw digital as a waste of money. However, we were always able to justify the spend on digital by offsetting the billable website work. \n\nThe marketing manager eventually moved on to bigger and better things. Rather than promote me or hire in a replacement, the company moved the marketing responsibilities to Dapper Dan. \n\nDapper Dan’s changes were immediate and far-reaching. He removed the digital budget. He required that 50% of my time would be sales support, to ‘better enable the sales team’. He incorporated the billable work with his own team’s revenue. He rewrote my annual objectives to align purely with sales targets, rather than marketing. When I voiced my objections, he took me aside for a ‘friendly chat’ and told me if I didn’t like it, I could always leave. \n\nNaturally I went and complained extensively to the departed marketing manager over drinks. After listening sympathetically for 45 minutes, she held up a hand, said ‘Stop’, and shared some life advice. ‘Each job pays you twice. You get your money now, that’s your wage. You also get experience now, that’s how you get paid in the future. So. Are you still getting paid? Yes? Are you still learning? No? Figure out how to keep learning, or leave.’ \n\nTaking the advice to heart, I busted my ass for the next year. I worked on digital outside of office hours. I made friends with the tech provider’s support and dev teams. I went to developer group meetups, attended conferences, studied for and acquired industry qualifications. I joined the national marketers and digital marketers group. I dug through blogs, articles, emailed people, took every opportunity to cross skill, upskill, to learn. \n\nAnd I sat with a smile on my face in the sales meetings as Dapper Dan delegated dumb do-work to me so his team of sycophants could make the company’s growth figures look spectacular. Spectacular they were, to the point that the company was acquired, and Dapper Dan betrayed me. \n\nYou see, managers have the discretion to assign a pool of shares to high performing staff. The shares have no real value and can’t be traded, but in the event of a management buy out, they would suddenly have value - and quite a lot of value. \n\nDapper Dan felt it appropriate to reward every SALESperson in his team with a generous parcel of shares. As a SUPPORTperson, I would not be the beneficiary of such kindness. I’d had a verbal agreement with the previous marketing manager that the pool would be shared across the entire team so was pretty shocked to discover I’d been excluded from the pool. \n\nI queried him on it, per the previous agreement, and he said (verbatim) ‘Well, an verbal agreement is only worth the paper it’s written on. You don’t make any sales, you haven’t built the business, you don’t get a cut’. \n\n'If you didn’t like it,' he reiterated, 'you're welcome to leave.'\n\nThat is EXACTLY what I decided to do. Except I didn’t tell him. \n\nThe way the contract handover works in this instance is that all staff cease employment with company X on one day. The following day, they commence employment with company Y. Annual leave is paid out and begins to re-accrue at the new employer. Other arrangements - salaries, long service leave and length of service - may be transferred to the new employer. \n\nAbout six weeks before the handover, Dapper Dan passed me my new contract. I waited a week, came back with some enthusiastic queries on the new benefits, which took him two weeks to follow up. I quietly registered a domain name and parked it, then spun up a Wordpress instance and started building a personal blog. \n\nThree weeks away from drop date, everyone’s frantically running around getting all the deals as close as possible to closing and employment contracts are the last thing on his mind. I go back to him, I tell him I have a couple more things I need to check out and I’ll email them through to him before I sign it. I spend a few more nights throwing together a bunch of blog articles relating to Recruitment Technology. How to articles, that kinda stuff, many of my own installation notes. \n\nA week passes, I fire off a couple of really complex questions around the transfer of benefits. He obviously forgets about them, then in the week of the handover, catches heat from the HR team about the outstanding contract and pulls me into a meeting room to berate me about not having signed the new contract.\n\nI explain I’m waiting on his feedback on those specific points before I’ll commit, that I don’t want to be disadvantaged moving into the new role, call out the lack of a share option as an example. Clearly frustrated, he drops the words I’ve been waiting for. ‘If the signed contract is not on my desk on Friday, don’t bother coming into the office Monday.’ He paused for dramatic effect, and reiterated ‘I mean it. You won’t have a job.’ I replied that I completely understand and that I’ll have everything he needs on his desk by close of business Friday.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Dapper Dan leaves the office early to attend his normal ‘client networking’ visits which typically involve long lunches and alcohol. \n\nAt 4.45pm I save the final set of forecasting and reporting to the share drive, send an email to the IT team passing over access to the Marketing lastpass account which contains the global database of usernames and passwords for all digital assets (including client sites), an Excel workbook containing my reporting macros and the location of all my documentation. I redirect my phone to Dapper Dan’s desk number, lock my laptop and leave it on his desk along with my ID card.\n\nOver the weekend I push my personal website live and add my contact details to my LinkedIn profile, switching it to 'Actively Searching' mode. I figure my holiday pay will cover me for a couple of weeks of downtime before I have to go diving back into the workforce. \n\nOn Monday, I’m enjoying a long walk in the spring sunshine with my dog, who’s incredibly happy that his human has not disappeared down the driveway at 0720 per normal. We stop for coffee at a local cafe and my phone begins to ring. It’s one of the sales drones at old company; I ignore it and thoroughly enjoy the freedom of being able to amble through a park without anywhere to be. The phone buzzes another eight or ten times by the time I get home. The poop has well and truly hit the windmill.\n\nI check my voicemails, ignoring those I know from my previous employer and returning the phone calls of two ex-clients to let them know that my contract has ended and to check in with Dapper Dan for work in progress - or contact the technology provider for support requests. \n\nShortly afterwards I got a call from a bemused contact who works at the technology provider who’s been fielding support calls that I’d normally handle. He listens with increasing interest as I explained the situation, then tells me he’d call back shortly. \n\nTen minutes later he’s back with the Head of Product on the line, asking about my lunch preferences. She arranges to meet me at a nearby Thai place. Over a delicious red duck curry, she cheerfully describes the wonders of a career as a contractor. She also mentions the day rates for highly qualified, industry-certified staff, mentioned that Tech Provider were really struggling to find such staff and gives me the number of a recruiter who may or may not have been on Tech Supplier’s preferred supplier list. I call the recruiter on the way home. \n\nMeanwhile, my collection of voicemails from Dapper Dan was growing by the hour as he came to grips with the breadth of the problem that he’d generated. At some point in the late afternoon, HR must’ve clicked to what had happened and I received a polite SMS from the personal number of the regional HR Directory asking if I was available for a quick chat. \n\nI call through and discussed the options presented to me by Dapper Dan on Friday, and that I felt I had no option but to follow his instructions. They probed for more information and it became apparent they were unaware that Dapper Dan had pulled an ultimatum without first engaging HR. They then informed me that to benefit from the sale of my shares, I would need to transfer to the new company and remain in their employment for a full year. \n\nWhen I explained that I had no such share options, there was a full four second silence. It transpires that this, too, was not adequately communicated to HR. I mentioned that I’d appreciate it if Dapper Dan could discontinue his voicemails to me as I found them unprofessional and had no intent of recommencing employment under his management. We ended the call politely, I wished them all the best and regretted the conversation had to happen under such circumstances. \n\nMy contract for Tech Provider came through via the PSL agency at 11pm that evening and was signed and returned the following day. \n\nI was deployed to client site that Wednesday. \n\n*Post Departure*\nI met up with one of the old IT team at a conference three months after it all went down. He was ecstatic to fill me in on what had happened. \n\nThe first notice anyone got of it was the service desk asking who they should route my LastPass account to and why I’d be passing it around. One of the techs came up to my floor to find me, then found an empty desk. Asked around for where I’d moved to and noone knew. That was the first call, from one of the Sales drones trying to locate me. \n\nThe tech went to Dapper Dan’s desk and found my laptop with my ID and post-it note taped to it. He put two and two together, went back downstairs and checked the access logs and realised the last time I’d logged in was Friday. He then locked my account for security purposes and went to HR to check if there was a leaver form. \n\nHR checks, no leaver form AND a great big red cross next to 'employment contract received'. HR calls Dapper Dan, who’s not in the office. Dapper Dan says ‘No, contract should be on my desk, it was on there on Friday, I’m out on the road at the moment, give me till lunch time and I’ll sort it out’. Obviously thinking that I’m grandstanding. Starts to call me and leave messages then gets progressively agitated as he realises I’m not coming back. \n\nWhen he gets into the office, he can’t find the contract either so he goes to HR and ‘explains’ what has happened, says I have been stonewalling them and it’s cool, he’ll get it sorted, it’s between me and him. HR says erm, no, this is our thing now, and the HRD sends me the SMS. \n\nShortly after my phone conversation the HRD walks into a sales meeting and very abruptly pulls Dapper Dan out. They disappear into a meeting room where it may only be assumed that Dapper Dan was required to spell out exactly what had occurred and address the comments that I had made. I suspect he came completely clean at that stage.\n\nDapper Dan was subsequently reamed as only HR and senior management can ream a manager who’s f*cked up. He was demoted, decoupled from Marketing, his budget reduced by half and a new, separate Marketing function created. \n\nHis team were collectively put under review and forced to carry out their own reporting, tracking and metrics, which lacked the coherence and consistency that I’d been able to deliver. This reduced the capacity of the team. A couple of them left and they missed out on some key deals. \n\nIn the fallout they completely dropped the ball on the client website builds. They went to market to try and find a resource who could fulfil these builds, and Dapper Dan was reportedly astounded to discover that experienced technical marketing staff are both hard to find and expensive to recruit. \n\nThey were unable to fill the role and the builds were taken back inhouse by the tech provider, who now had an experienced resource to deploy (me). I ended up working on three of these at full utilisation rate, which was paid by the new company. I’m pretty sure Dapper Dan would’ve seen the funding arrangements for these and would know my day rate - which is substantially higher than his. \n\n*Much later*\nAs the sales lead, Dapper Dan had to bear the displeasure of his superiors for the full twelve months before he could claim his share payout. It would’ve been a really, really shitty twelve months for him. He resigned within two weeks of the anniversary of the purchase, and the company enforced a six month notice period and another 12 month no-compete clause. Any benefit he would have received from the share payout would have been consumed over that 12 months unless he switched industries or moved cities. Last time I saw he was on the job market. \n\nAs for me? Happily living the life of the contractor. I get paid for the hours I work and I work the hours I want. \n\nMy old marketing manager is now VP of something at a large multinational. I’ve used her speech several times when giving young, frustrated staff career advice. \n\nTL;DR\n\nOld school sales manager attempts to call my bluff. Hilarity ensues. ",

        "text": "So, years ago, I worked for a transport ambulance company. Mostly we would run patients from hospital to hospital, we would do some emergency calls. However, in general, we were a glorified taxi service. Our patients needed medical care, for sure, but we had very few emergencies.\n\nWe had around 7\\-8 dispatchers. I don't remember most, but I remember 2. L, because she was the freakin' bomb. She would always try to take care of her crews, stagger work, delay calls a few minutes if it meant crews getting off on time, etc.\n\nThen there was B....oh god did people hate B. He was the guy that if your 16 hour shift ended at 5p.m. he would assign you a call with a 2 hour transport time at 4:59. There were shifts I literally got off 4\\-5 hours late due to this guy. What happens later I wouldn't have done to anyone else, but it also wouldn't have bothered anyone else. This guy followed the letter of the law to a T. \n\nNow, normal radio protocol for a call would go something like this: D=Dispatch, C=Crew, and we try to keep things as short and simple as possible.\n\nD: Unit 214\n\nC: Unit 214, go ahead.\n\nD: Unit 214, be in route to \\(X\\) hospital. Information to pager\n\nC: Unit 214, en route.\n\nThen, when getting to scene,\n\nC: Unit 214\n\nD: Unit 214, go ahead.\n\nC: Unit 214, show us on scene.\n\nNow, there are good reasons for this. If there is a screw up, we have recorded lines. And mistakes happened. Wrong info sent. Dispatch said wrong hospital name, etc. \n\nAnyway, this one Saturday \\(usually a lighter day for us\\) it was L and B in dispatch. B=B, M=Me/my partner\n\nFirst call of the day.\n\nB: Unit 227 \n\nM: 27, go ahead \\(yes, I missed a 2 on purpose typing this. All units that day began with 2\\)\n\nB: Unit 227, be en route to Hospital \\(X\\)\n\nM: 27, confirmed. \n\n\\(A few minutes go by\\)\n\nB: Unit 227\n\nM: 27 here\n\nB: Unit 227, are you en route \\(we were, I thought I called it\\)\n\nM: 27, ummm, I thought I called us en route?\n\nB: 227, you said you confirmed information, but you didn't confirm you were en route.\n\nI remember gritting my teeth. TECHNICALLY he is correct, but he's being a stickler \\(btw, no other dispatcher did this. This is also a completely non emergency call of a patient going home\\)\n\nM: 27, you can show us en route for 5 minutes\n\nB: 227 confirmed en route\n\n\\(We arrive\\)\n\nM: 27\n\nB: Dispatch, what unit was this? \\(People cut out mikes sometimes, he legit may not have heard me\\)\n\nM: 27, show us on scene.\n\nB: Dispatch, still didn't catch your FULL unit number.\n\nOh....okay. I see what you're doing here....teeth grinding continues.\n\nM: \\(takes deep breath\\) 227\n\nB: Unit 227, go ahead.\n\nM: Unit 227, on scene.\n\nWe go, get the patient. Now I'm in the back, so my partner is on the radio.\n\nHalfway to destination our pagers go off. Basically \\(I don't know if it was just to us and he was being passive, or if it actually went out to everyone\\) we get a message \"Crews, please remember to give your FULL unit numbers on the radio.\"\n\nNow, just to be clear, we would have our units start with a 1 if they were staffed with a medic, a 2 if EMTs only, or a 6 for specialty calls. To avoid possible confusion, they really tried not to have a 115 and a 215 up together. So us calling '27' wasn't really going to mess anything up. We were the only 27 that day, our employee numbers were tied to the truck, so IF anything got screwed up, there's plenty of info about who did it.\n\nAnyway, call is complete. We clear it, and don't have a call for awhile.\n\nAbout 1/2 hour later:\n\nB: 227\n\nM: Go ahead \\(Now, no one but us would have ANY reason to say that, even forgetting to identify\\)\n\nB: Unit 227\n\nM: Go ahead\n\nB: Unit 227\n\nM: \\(Me, deep shuddering breath\\) 227, go ahead.\n\nB: Unit 227, be en route to Hospital \\(X\\)\n\nM: 27, confirmed and en route\n\nB: Unit 227, was that you that confirmed you were en route?\n\nAaaaaaand this is where I lose it.\n\nM: \\(In a pretty loud and forceful voice\\) **Unit 227, repeat Unit 227, once again, that is Unit TWO TWO SEVEN, confirming and enroute. I repeat, this is Unit 227, again, Unit 227, showing en route to Hospital \\(X\\). Information to pager confirmed. Unit 227, that is Unit two hundred and twenty seven, is en route to Hospital \\(X\\). We are responding from Location \\(Y\\) with an eta of 14 minutes, Repeat, Unit 227 responding to Hospital \\(X\\) from Location \\(Y\\) with an eta of 14 minutes. That is One Four minutes. Again, Unit 227 en route!** \n\nAnd I slam down the mike. Silence for a moment.\n\nB: Unit 227, call dispatch public service \\(this means to call the actual phone line to dispatch so the conversation isn't over the air\\)\n\nThis I ignore. I ignore it for 2 more times. My pager goes off, telling me to call.\n\nWe get to destination.\n\nM: 227, on scene.\n\nB: 227 confirmed. Call public service.\n\nAgain, I ignore it.\n\nFinally, my pager goes off. \"Hey, it's L. Can you please call dispatch before B has a heart attack? He just stepped out, I'll pick up.\"\n\nSo I call, and in a completely happy voice when she answers I say \"Hey, L! How are you?\"\n\nTo wrap up the story, B basically wanted to chew me out, and L wanted to 'warn me' but I had kinda figured that out. When B got on the phone, he couldn't tell me exactly what radio protocol I had violated. And I asked so nicely. I told him that because he seemed to be having issues hearing me, I wanted to be absolutely clear. You know. For his sake.\n\n Getting back to the station at the end of the day, my supervisor basically told me that he wanted to chew me out, but couldn't figure out what to say. He knew I was being belligerent but within the scope of our radio protocol. Basically he just said \"Hey, I know B is an ass, just don't poke the bear, huh?\" \n\nMan, I've got a few more from that company....",

        "text": "I've been traveling as deployment engineer for many years.   There was a project in Brazil and they put me in a hotel at the business central area of Sao Paulo.\n\n  After 3 months they decided my travel  expenses would be reviewed by an accountant of the Brazil office,  instead of my source office.   I needed a haircut badly and I decided to visit a saloon next to the hotel they chose for me to stay.  They made an exeption and cut my hair being a male.  The bill for a haircut was US $50.   I thought it was expensive but what the hell,  I work my ass every day and been traveling for too long.  So I put it in my report. \n\nThat week the accountant called me to say I cannot submit a $50 haircut,  that I must do any grooming from home in advance,  before traveling...\n--I've been traveling for 3 months and 2 months to go... - I responded. \n\nShe was not willing to pay it.  My boss interceded for me and at the end I got the full report paid. \n\nAnother 2 months passed: I entered a $25 haircut + one $25 taxi to take me to a cheaper place,  + another $25 taxi to come back to my hotel. \nThis lady said I should walk instead to a nearby place. \n--\"I'm sorry,  I'm a foreigner in this city and for my safety,  following the travel policies, I'm entitled to take taxis to any place.\"\n\nThe woman had no choice than to accept my reports.

I was working fry station.  Now this entailed me dealing with fries and bringing them to the fry warmer that was at the expo station which was maybe 10 feet away.  When I would bring the fries I would look at the next couple of tickets.  At one point this pissed off the expo though I wasn't in his way.  He told me that I \"wasn't to cross this line\" while  sweeping his arm across the floor like a pendulum.  Well this was well out of reach of the fry warmer, but okay.\n\nThe next batch of fries I held in the transfer bowl standing there looking at him, waiting.  He sees me and comes to get the fries.  A little while later the next batch was ready but he hadn't yet returned the transfer bowl; so I stood at the line looking, waiting.  He gets me the bowl.  Each time this happened he needed to stop what he was doing to deal with me and walk the 10 feet to me and 10 back.  This doesn't sound like much but in a kitchen these wasted steps are a pain in the ass.\n\nI also called for counts on things to ensure I had enough of everything cooking.  This made him stop and look at the board and talk to me, something that was handled while getting him the fries he needed normally.\n\nHe quickly told me I could cross the line as he was sick of dealing with me every few minutes.",

        "text": "For reasons that I won't get into here, the organisation that I worked for spent an uncomfortable amount of time before even planning, and executing a plan to upgrade from Exchange 2007 to Exchange 2013. Exchange 2007 hadn't been patched in a year and a half as well, due to management being exceptionally gun shy about any sort of change. \n\nSaid environment had 45,000 users, 1.5tb of Public Folder databases, spread across 3 data centres, across the second largest country in the world. \n\nThere's also 36 Exchange 2013 servers spread across 2 different data centres, the connections would come in through the load balancers, to 2013, proxied to the 2007 environment. The 2013 servers didn't really do much, not having any mailboxes on them. Their primary goal was to run their warranty down.\n\nDue to the complexity of the environment, we had all kinds of crazy outages, hiccups, blips, and so on. The mere mention of patching the 2007 environment to help with stability (and the subsequent outages) gets middle management's hackles up. \n\nNow, every time one of our middle managers - of which there were many had a blip, outage, or hiccup on their phone or Outlook, it was a Severity A call to Microsoft. We'd be on support calls for 5+ hours a time, only to relay back that we'd need to patch, migrate, decom. We'd been on these pointless calls 2 or 3 times a week. \n\n3+ hours into a support call, I needed to use the little boy's room. So, I mentioned on the call and support chat that I'd be back in 5ish. Come back to the call to a separate message from  a middle manager:\n\n&gt;Hey, where did you go? We need you!\n\n\"Was in the bathroom, mentioned it on the bridge, and in the support chat.\"\n\n&gt;That's unacceptable, you cannot leave these calls for any reason! I'll be speaking with your other middle manager!\n\n\"OK\"\n\n&gt;No apology?\n\n\"Oh, sorry for having to poop\"\n\n&gt;...\n\nThe next day I'm in the office, my middle manager in particular pulls me aside to give me shit for taking a shit. So I roll with it. He also sends an email for the paper trail, as it were. \n\nHead down to the local pharmacy, buy a bedpan, Depends, and a condom catheter. Scan the receipts in, create an expense report. Attach the 'Don't leave your desk during Severity A, or else' email for good measure.\n\nMonth end comes around, and my middle manager pulls me aside, asking me what the deal was with my expenses, and why I needed a bedpan, Depends, and a condom catheter. Remind him that he told me to never leave my desk, no matter what happened. \n\nIt's at that point that he had an epiphany of exactly what he was requiring from his underlings. Henceforth, we were granted the privilege to relieve ourselves when we needed to. \n\nI've since moved on to greener pastures. Some say that the migration project is still going on to this very day.\n\nOh, and my expenses were approved. ",

        "text": "I was working for a major credit card company. At first it was great, then our manager was promoted to another location and they promoted a manager from the call center to manage us (in account auditing).\n\nIt started out okay but she apparently didn’t think she was managing us enough as we all knew what we needed to be doing and generally just did it without constant oversight. \n\nSo she decided that she would managed our little 8 person team the way she did her 45 person pod in the call center. She wanted us to give her a detailed accounting of everything we did for our entire shift. \n\nNow after about a week of having to account for every thing we did, while at the same time listening to her plan her wedding on company time (and dealing with her constant “feedback” that we needed to include more detail in our account of what we did each day) we’d all had more than enough. \n\nWe started sending her minute-by-minute accounts of our day, right down to the minute spent walking to the restroom, time to use it, wash our hands, and walk back to our desks.  \n\nOur department started falling farther and farther behind because we spent so much time filling out her time sheets that the higher ups started noticing.  \n\nAfter a couple weeks of this, her boss decided to wander down and figure out what on earth was going on. She was paying no attention to us, as normal, since she was soooo busy setting up cake tastings or whatever. \n\nFirst he came by our cubes to see what we were doing with our time and saw the time sheets on everyone’s desk and asked why we all had them. After explaining that our new overlord wanted us to give more detailed accounts of what we did every minute, he told us to stop screwing around and get back to doing the work we were paid to do. \n\nThen he headed over to her office, I’m guessing to tell her that we were adults and didn’t need to account for every minute, and heard her planning her wedding before he ever made it to her office. (This woman had never heard of an indoor voice so we all knew every little detail of her wedding planning by this point.)\n\nAfter he closed her door and “counseled” her for a good hour there were no more time sheets. And when we came in the next morning we found out that she’d been demoted back to the call center and her boss had taken over managing the 8 of us himself. \n\nSo we’d all managed to waste enough time that not only did we get the ridiculous time sheets tossed, but got our boss caught wasting time and demoted.

        "text": "Decades ago, I had a boss who was a bit of jerk.  Everyone ended up quitting on him eventually, and this is one example why.  I had put in a request for a 2-day vacation a month beforehand to attend an anime convention - a Thursday and a Friday, with the following Monday being a holiday where everyone was off.  It was the first time I had asked for any sort of time off (vaca, sick, personal, etc.) in my year of working there.  And I only felt good about asking for the time off because my IT department was finally fully staffed, so the work of 3 people I had been doing by myself for most of that year was now spread out between me and 2 other guys.  \n\n\n\nSo the convention goes off without a hitch, but I sadly get some con crud.  Not wanting to get the other 2 guys sick, I called out sick for 1 day.  The boss goes off.  He demands a doctor's note, because now I have been gone 5 days, and HR regulations demand that I have a doctor's note to justify sick time for 3 days or more.  But technically, of course, I've only had 1 sick day off, so I read up the employee handbook, and sure enough, it's *3 working days* or more of calling in sick.  Again, I haven't taken any time off for the past year, worked OT without pay (exempt employee) by myself for most of the past year, and he is questioning my credibility.  Still, wanting to show that I am a good employee (how naive I was), I go to the doctor's office to show that I am not \"faking it.\"  \n\n\nThe doctor says I have a cold, and I ask him if I'm contagious at this point, and he said, \"You shouldn't be after today, but you should rest at least a week to get your strength back up.\"  The doctor then gives me a note saying I should be out for one week.  I then call back my boss giving wanting to give him the good news that I won't be contagious the next day so I'm thinking of coming in if I am feeling better.  Unfortunately for him, the only thing he wanted to hear was if I had gotten a doctor's note (and yes, I'm feeling like a juvenile delinquent, whereas I am a grown man).  I told him yes, and before I could tell him I'll no longer be contagious the next day, he demands, \"Just give me the doctor's note!\"  He slams down the phone in my ear, so I fax the doctor's note to him (again, about 20 years ago - but I was cool enough to have my own fax machine).  So instead of showing up the next day, I stay home and show up a week later, all paid sick leave.  Yes, the boss was steamed after that, and I quit a couple of months after that because I couldn't stand it anymore.  The other 2 left soon thereafter (the last one called me after he quit, and laughed, \"I'm free!!!!\") and my boss was let go for not being able to keep the IT support positions staffed.",

She would be standing in my cube every morning at 7:59 AM and come by at 4:59 PM to be sure I was still working.  She felt I was fucking off since  being in IT, 98&amp;#37; of my maintenance had to be done after midnight, and I would sometimes not come in until 10 or 11 because I was working until 3 or 4 AM.  That was unacceptable and I was still expected to be warming my chair by 8 AM.  I was the only person doing my specialized job, at that time.\n\nBeing the obvious slacker she saw me for, she insisted on knowing EVERYTHING I did.  So I began drowning her in emails.  I would purposely make the emails as technical and convoluted as possible, assuming I was speaking to another engineer, instead of a paper pusher.  If she wanted to get anything out of the emails, she had to do hours of research, or ask me about them.  When she asked me about an email, I would take hours explaining it; painstakingly going over everything from the very basics to high level abstract.  I would say 80&amp;#37; of the time, after our discussions, she had no clue what we just talked about.I copied her on every email I sent, so she would be kept in the loop.\n\nSent her an email when nature called.  Sent her an email when I was back at my desk.  Sent her an email when I would grab a cup of coffee, which was often since I was averaging about 5 hrs sleep. Etc...  Over the course of a couple of months, I sent her \\&gt; 2500 emails/month, each with a request receipt, so I would know she was getting them.  :\\)\n\nEventually, she requested I move to another Director.  The next few years were a dream!  New Director was interested only in results, and managed that way.  Gave me a mission set me off to work.  Trusted me to do my job, did not need any communication if progress was being made, only at completion of my tasks or if I ran into an obstacle he could help remove.\n\n  \nTL;DR:  Drowned my Director in emails daily until I got a new Director.",

I was excited to actually be able to work a holiday and make some extra money... untill the other overnighter calls off the night before my first shift of the week.\n\nSo I hatched a plan, I texted the person that works the shifts before mine and asked her if she'd be cool staying an extra 10 minutes a day that week so I'd still be under 40 for memorial day, she agreed and loved my plan so today I show up to my shift because I'm at 39.8 hours, still eligible to work the holiday, 20 min into my shift I was making overtime as well as holiday pay... next paycheck will feel very good.\n\n\nEdit: Holy CRAP I am blown away by all the kind words and encouragement from this post, I really didn't expect it to blow up like this and have so many people cheering me on, thank you so much everyone!!!!!!\n\nEdit 2: people keep bringing up the 39.80 minutes thing, my work counts the hour in % so 39.80 = 39 hours 40 minutes, yes it's dumb but that's how they do it.",

She's not even that high on the totem pole, to be honest. It goes me, team leader, global service team leader, , leadership on demand (I have no clue what to acronym LOD actually stands for, so I made that term up), and then Store Lead, the highest position in the store. This evil lady is a GSTL. Right in the middle.\n\nI work in the self checkout, and she's always on my butt about absolutely nothing. She's the only manager with a problem with anyone ever. She's been here for 15 years too, and gets away with this crap.\n\nAs she hates my guts, I generally need her permission to even breathe. If I need to use the restroom (and I have to go a lot, sadly), I have to let her know so that the self checkout is still manned.\n\nExcept, half the time, and she knows this, I'll suddenly have to go RIGHT THEN AND THERE. I can't help it when this happens, and sometimes I can still hold it to let her know. Sometimes I can't, and have to run off.\n\nNow, this literally takes me about a minute and a half tops. 15 seconds to get to the restroom, 20 seconds to relieve myself, 40 seconds to wash my hands, and 15 to get back. But if I do this without letting her know, and she catches me, all hell breaks loose.\n\nToday, she caught me entering the restroom, then pulled me aside as I left it. She sits me down in a side room, and berates me for the next five minutes. I'd have been back at the self checkout long, long ago without her doing this.\n\nShe yelled at me because I need to think about all the stuff that could get stolen in that time, how if I'm not there, and a guest has an issue, I'm not there to fix it. I HAVE to tell her every time I leave my station for any reason now! Or else! It doesn't matter that none of that will happen when other people can see my station in that minute and it's very unlikely anything will go wrong.\n\nI'm 100% done with this. I'm done with her. I'm already going to talk to HR about her later(they're going to look into her behavior. She has too many complaints), but I decide that you know what, I'm going to comply with her request. I'm going to comply... *Maliciously.*\n\nGuest Services is literally two feet away from my station. When guests decide they don't want to buy an item, I usually just give it to them. Now, I'm announcing it over the radio. \"This is dman2life, leaving Blue Side Self Checkout to give the reshop to guest services.\"\n\nI said this maybe 20 times in my last three hours today. I also take orders or to people's cars and I would announce it every time, even though we have three devices that tell us when that is happening anyway. So the device would beep, and I'd ring everyone up on the radio.\n\nOver and over. I'm going to keep doing this every day, until I'm allowed to use the restroom without permission during an emergency. Wish me luck.\n\nEDIT: This pee issue happens maybe once or twice a day, and sometimes not at all. Usually, I can inform my boss that I need to pee and can hold it for her to respond. A few times, I car, and this happens. There other bosses are more understanding.\n\nI'm also not loss prevention. There's also high definition cameras EVERYWHERE, including on the register itself, showing you it's watching you.",

        "text": "Inspired by /u/Nerdfury83 story of stupid bosses making rules about staff sickness.\n\nTo set the scene, this story is about a colleague who hated our supervisor; who was a cantankerous ex-military grade-A arse hole. Unreasonable and, quite frankly, a bully.\n\nMy colleague came in with a support on his elbow one day and told the supervisor that he had been to his personal Dr. (GP) who told him he had tennis elbow and to take it easy - and suggested light duties. We worked in a fairly physical type of job where further injury would write you off for months after. \n\nAnyway, supervisor asked colleague why he was injured (work related old injury) and that if he didn't have a written note then he would have to go to A&amp;E (accident and emergency). Despite my colleague saying he'd already sought medical attention and that it was tennis elbow.\n\n\"No. You need to go tae A&amp;E\"\n\nFine. So my colleague goes to A&amp;E in work time, waits the 3hrs in the queue, gets to see the A&amp;E Doctor. He explains that he's already seen his own Doctor and has diagnosed it as tennis elbow with an advisory to take it easy.\n\nA&amp;E doctor agrees with the diagnosis and asks why he's there so my colleague explains the supervisors stance on the matter and his insistence on going to A&amp;E. \n\nColleague was discharged and went back to work with the instruction to take it easy. \n\nA short time later, supervisor gets a call from the A&amp;E Doctor telling him that he will not send anyone else to A&amp;E unless it was an emergency. Does he realise how stretched they are? and Why has he been sent when he's already seen a Doctor? \n\nMy colleague was allowed to do light duties without further challenge and my supervisor was spoken to by his supervisor about his approach to the matter.",

        "text": "Buckle up boys this will be a long one, TL;DR at bottom\n\n**Background:**\n\nMy first long term job was working in a call center doing contract work for various companies, we would periodically be retrained and moved to work with a new client in the same building on a different floor. The flavor of the month had me working as technical support and a warranty specialist for an american cellphone provider but I was physically located in Canada. Part of my job is to diagnose what is wrong with your device then help you make the decision if the device should be RMAed (locally or mail) exception exchanged or not covered, in which case you are stuck with the device. This happened just after Pokemon Go became the big thing. Also I have a near photographic memory so a lot of this is exactly as it happened but edited down and paraphrased a bit.\n\n**The story:**\n\nKey: M: me. CX: customer. SR: Senior rep. TL: Team leader. FL: Floor leader.\n\n*Ring Ring!*\nM: \"Thank you for calling, what can I do for you today?\"\n\nCX: \"My phone is broke.\"\n*A lot of customers start their calls this way without saying hello or even specifying exactly what 'broke' means*\n\nM: \"I'm sorry to hear that! What exactly seems to be the problem?\"\n\nCX: \"IT'S BROKE!\"\n\nM: \"Okay, what is the phone doing or not doing?\"\n\nCX: \"It won't turn on.\"\n\n*We run through some basic troubleshooting, during which I discovered he had a basically brand new Iphone 7+ in one of the larger storage sizes, that would not turn on, had no lights and was not detected when plugged into a computer*\nM: \"Okay, it seems the phone is de-\"\n\nCX: \"I told you!\"\n\nM: \"We will start the warranty process, is there any liquid or physical damage?\"\n\n*no response*\nM: \"Sir?\"\n\nCX: \"Why does it matter? Just replace it!\"\n\nM: \"I can send out a replacement overnight for you, but if we get the device back and it has physical or liquid damage it will be returned and you will be charged full cost.\"\n\nCX: \"It only has some tiny scratches, just send me the box!\"\n\n*Small surface scratches are fine as long as they do not cause a problem themselves. I continued to warn him another three times about physical or liquid damage knowing full well he was lying and ended up sending out the box. Normally this would be the end of this story as very rarely do we actually talk to the same customer twice. However about 20ish days later i was approached by my TL*\n\n\n**The Aftermath**\n\nTL: \"u/flanigomik, did you talk to CX on (date)\"\n\n*This happens from time to time where they need follow up on a specific situation*\nM: \"I'm not sure, what was it about?\"\n\n*He reminds me of the customer and exactly what happened*\nM: \"Oh! That guy. Why? What's wrong?\"\n\n\nTL: (College) has him on the phone right now and is screaming at her demanding to speak to you.\n*Now normally we are not required, and are usually forbidden from, taking a call from another agent like this (You get who you get, sucks to suck) but because of the situation the manager approved it and it was handed back to me.*\n\n*Call transferred in*\nM: \"This is u/flanigomik, How can I help\"\n\nCX: \"You (remove long chain of expletives taking about three minutes)\"\n\nM: \"Sir, I am going to have to ask you to remain professional, what can I help with?\"\n*The customer relays that he sent his phone in with 'just a few scratches' and we must have damaged it in shipping because he was sent back a destroyed phone and charged full price for a new brand new Iphone. I looked up his serial number which we can use to find pictures of the phones when they get to our warehouse, the box was pristine but the phone looked like it had been thrown into a jet engine or something, in three peaces and bent and warped every which way.*\n\nM: \"Sir, I have pictures here, this phone looks like it went through a grinder, what happened?\"\n\nCX: \"I told you it was just scratched! Why would they even need to check?\"\n\nM: \"We check all phones returned, what happened?\"\n*If a customer cooperates I can sometimes cut them a deal even when it is 100% their own fault, this is where the story really gets strange*\n\nCX: \"My son was playing a game, he is a minor so I shouldn't have to pay.\"\n*wait what?*\n\nM: \"Sir, the phone is in your name, did your son call in and exchange it?\"\n*Voice quality isn't always the best and I wasn't sure. If the son did exchange it I could make an argument for reversal of the charge cause it was done without account holder permission*\n\nCX: \"I exchanged it, it's my phone!\"\n\nM: \"Then as per the terms and conditions that I warned you about, read to you twice, you got in an email and were on the box you shipped to us, you have to pay.\"\n\nCX: \"My son is a minor so I don't have to pay for damages he caused and I am going to sue you for damaging my property!\"\n*people often make weak legal threats like this but the policy is to flag a senior who is roaming and get their say. I put the customer on hold, I asked to do so by the way.*\n\nSR: \"What's up?\"\n*I filled him in and he laughed, told me to try to get the full story and he would talk to the customer. I went back to the customer*\n\nM: \"Sir, I was speaking to my support staff and we need to know EXACTLY what happened so we can get this escalated and taken care of for you.\"\n\nCX: \"(condescendingly like you would to a 5 year old) See? Was that so hard for you to do?\"\n\nM: \"So your son was playing a game, What happened?\"\n\n*Now that he thought he was winning the argument he was all to eager to tell me all about it. So his Son had been playing Pokemon GO, for those unaware there are eggs that hatch new Pokemon that you have to walk specific distances to get. The dad is a painter and has one of those big 24 inch portable fans. There was this myth going around that if you taped your phone to the blades of a ceiling fan it would count as walking when it spins on low speed. So an industrial fan on high speed should do it faster right? So his kid attached the phone to the fan with a few pieces of scotch tape which held just long enough for the thing to get up to speed before coming off and being torn apart by the blades and destroying the fan itself.*\n\n**The escalation** \n\nCX: \"So you are going to give me a free phone, $5000 to replace my fan (it costs like $250) and $10,000 to keep quiet about it or I am going to sue the shit out of you!\"\n\n\nM: \"Alright sir I will place you on hold and relay that to the management and get back to you.\"\n*I put him on hold and told the SR, he was giving me a 'bullshit' look*\n\nSR: \"(trying his hardest not to laugh) There is no way that is real!\"\n\nM: \"I swear that's what he said.\"\n*He took the call and tried to explain that; 1. He is responsible 2. We don't accept threats and 3. He will be charged. Some time later the call escalated again to my TL, Then to the FL who didn't believe us and thought the call was a prank, when he realized it was real he shut the customer down and told him that we would not be discussing the mater any further, because he was insisting that he was going to sue this is now a matter he has to take up with legal and they would be contacting him for the details shortly.*\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nCustomer's son broke phone with a fan playing Pokemon GO, sent in broken phone saying it wasn't broken and was warned we don't replace broken phones, got charged for phone, threatened to sue and is now in talks with Legal about uttering threats and RMA fraud.\n\n\n\nEdit: Formatting",

        "text": "LTL, FTP. TL;DR after the Epilogue\n\nApologies if this doesn't quite fit but I feel this is the best place for it. Maybe /r/ProRevenge too.\n\n**The backstory**:\n\nMy grandfather owned some 14 acres of land. There was a state-owned water supply ditch running between the top half and bottom half of this acreage.\nTo use official roads to get from the top half to the bottom half required a 5 mile detour that gramps had had enough with.\n\n**The history**:\n\nA neighbor had been granted the appropriate permits and everything required to build a bridge across this supply ditch a half-mile or so up the ditch.\n\nA neighbor of *his* was disgruntled with the bridge, hooked up some chains to his tractor and pulled that sucker down right into the supply ditch.\n\nThe state or county banned building bridges across the supply ditch because of this ass-hat and the debris that was dropped into the supply ditch.\n\n**The compliance**:\n\nHe'd had enough driving 10 minutes around to get to his other plot of land and decided he wanted to build this bridge.\n\nUpon learning of the prohibition of bridges across the ditch, he took it upon himself to re-survey his land and the rights granted to the state for the supply ditch to bisect his property.\n\nIt turned out, the state built this ditch just 20 feet away from the actual right-of-way that was granted to them for the ditch.\n\nHe got into a lengthy fight over it with the water board and it finally came down to an ultimatum: Let me build my bridge or move your supply ditch to the proper location.\n\nUltimately he won this battle and that summer began construction of the abutments and purchased a railroad car which was cut in half and the halves placed side-by-side across the abutments and the supply ditch.\n\nI still remember going out to his farm that summer and sandblasting those railroad cars and then painting it with a special paint to prolong the life of the bridge.\n\n**The Epilogue**:\n\nYears after the bridge was built, the land above the ditch was subdivided and placed in an HOA, the bridge being the property of said HOA. Parcels of the subdivided land were sold off and people moved in and built homes in this HOA.\n\nThese fools couldn't be arsed to meet once a year, have an official \"minutes\" of this meeting, and pay a minimal amount to keep the HOA running and the bridge under their control.\n\nDad and I went out there to try and fix it up after they let this shit lapse and got everything reinstated. Everything is honkey-dorey again and these morons are warned that we're not traveling half-way across the country again to fix their fuck-up.\n\nWhat did they do? They let that shit lapse **again**. The HOA is dissolved and as far as we know the bridge now belongs to the county who can open it up for public use so everybody above the ditch can make use of it instead of driving 5 miles around to get to the main highway.\n\n**TL;DR:** Grandpa wanted to build a bridge over a supply ditch to link his own land on either side, discovered the county built the ditch in the wrong location on his land, gave them the choice to move their ditch or let him build his bridge. He got that bridge built.",

One of these rules was that every time anyone had to get out of their seats for any reason, they had to ask her. This was in the middle of spring allergy season, too. My friend took full advantage of this rule. He would contstantly ask the teacher if he could get up for the smallest things. He did have some spring allergies, but they weren't nearly as bad as he made them out to be. Every 3 or 4 minutes he would ask for a tissue, and argue with the teacher about the rules she had set in place.

Instead of helping kids during my lessons she snoozed at the back or took over the lesson to yell at the kids for 40 minutes. Abandoned me in a supermarket on my first night in the city. Stole books from the school for her daughter to read (her daughter wasn't a student at our school). Never told me information on time, literally threw my official visa documents in the bin in front of me, and frequently asked me to proofread 10-page sermons from her church that she translated for the only foreigner who went there, even though she knew I wasn't religious and would prefer to be doing my actual job during work hours. The kids called her \"the Roach\". \n\nSo one day the Roach rushes in while I'm planning my lessons and grading tests. She rambles incoherently, frazzled and I figure out that she is demanding that I create lesson materials for her open lesson which is going to be observed by the principal and visitors from the department of education. Not just the materials, actually, but design a whole lesson that shows that she's a good teacher.\n\nOh, by the way, she needs it first thing tomorrow. What's that? It's already 16:30? Better get to work then. \n\nI designed the hell out of that lesson. We're talking a ppt with triggered animations from clicking different graphics, a lesson plan involving teams that rotate and mix, helping kids practice communicative English in line with all the latest pedagogy. Hell, it was even gamified. It wasn't too much extra for me since it was based off an example I'd done during my teacher training and I reused bits from my own lessons. But it required conceptual understanding and effort on the part of the teacher.\n\nShe never asked me to do her damn job again. ",

Our resources, our laws, our emergency services, etc, are not the same as yours in the US.*\n\nI worked in the call centre for a telco that did everything possible to stop employees from calling in sick or going home sick. At first, it was refusing to accept legal, free documentation and requiring you to see a doctor, even for the most mild of issues.\n\nThey moved onto just making life difficult for you if you called in sick or needed to go home \\- asking too many questions, wanting to know specifics, threatening pay, etc. They then started calling up the doctors to get information, then asking staff to sign agreements to allow them to call their doctors and discuss in full detail.\n\nThe final straw came when they introduced a new policy, which they never put in writing, to say that if people were too sick to work,  then they were too sick to go home and should require an ambulance at their own expense. Most people would either just walk out and suddenly face issues for leaving work without permission, or decide to put up with the illness \\- as a result, communicable diseases spread \\(including a whooping cough and H1N1 epidemic\\). So I decided to put a stop to it.\n\nOne day, unwell with a pretty nasty flu, I informed the boss that I'd be leaving early. I was told I'd need an ambulance if I was too sick to work, so I called one. The EMTs arrived with a guerney and all the all the gear that comes with an emergency, asking where the patient is.\n\nI came up and they started asking me questions about what was wrong, and I innocently told them that I just had something flu\\-like, had the sniffles, icy\\-hot skin, goosebumps \\- nothing too dramatic. They got annoyed that I'd called them and asked me why I did \\- so I said my manager had told me that I'd need an ambulance if I couldn't work.\n\nMy manager and his manager, naturally, swore black and blue that no one had informed me of this, and I had done this entirely on my own back. So I showed the EMTs the video I'd recorded in the private meeting room of my manager telling me otherwise. I told them that I'd told the boss I just had a flu, and that I didn't think the ambulance was necessary, but it was apparently company policy.\n\nThey asked me if I needed them, then left when I said I didn't. My boss pulled me into a meeting room to 'discuss my behaviour,' and tell me I'd breached law by recording without permission. I asked them, simply, who would come out worse: me, for recording a conversation to protect my interests while the company acted illegally, or them, being recorded for trying to force an employee to call an ambulance for a flu. Between unions, social media, fair work commissions, and the HR department \\- the results would be far more catastrophic for the lying manager than the poor, hard\\-done employee with the flu.\n\nThey sent me home, and when I returned a few days later, I was informed that they would be dropping the matter. No one else was asked to call an ambulance, and the company was fined pretty severely for wasting ambulance resources.",

        "text": "To preface, I work in IT and am responsible for ordering all technology related equipment.\n\nAbout a year ago I was in charge of getting required specs for computer needs and putting in an order for about 500 Pcs, monitors, keyboards, mice, etc.  for a new office building that was opening that my company manages. Being that I had already done this same quote for multiple buildings, I knew exactly what was needed. The standard PC build from our supplier comes with 4 gb memory. To run specific software, I have to include at minimum 8 gb, otherwise the computer all but stops working. When making the build through our vendor the additional 4 gb of memory only runs us an extra $26. I put the quote together and sent it off to our budgeting department for final approval and ordering. Within the hour I received the following emails from the head of budgeting (AKA jackass).\n\nJackass: I see you included an extra charge of $26x500 for computer memory?\n\nMe: Yeah. We need it to run X software.\n\nJackass: Will it run without the extra memory?\n\nMe: Not well\n\nJackass: We are already over budget. Don't order any upgraded equipment! Just get the basic stuff.\n\nAfter trying to explain why it was important several times and how the software would barely work at 4 gigs...\n\nMe (not in the mood to deal with his shit anymore): Sure thing\n\nSo I revised the order without the memory and sent it back to him. A few weeks later, the computers get delivered and are set up in the new offices. I get them all imaged with the software over the weekend and ready to go. First thing Monday morning I come in to a frantic slew of emails about how the specialized software won't run and nobody can do their job. After a few back-and-forth emails with the COO I sent the full email chain with jackass explaining what happened. I am told to immediately put in an order for the extra memory, have it delivered as soon as possible, and get it installed immediately.\n\nBy ordering the memory separately instead of installed initially at $26 per we had to pay an extra $50,000 ($128 per memory stick). Not only that, but I got a ton of overtime and the company lost out on a weeks worth of productivity. All in all, the company probably lost close to $200,000.\n\nJackass didn't get fired, but he now has his own policy of ordering what the IT guy suggests, no questions asked. \n\nEdit to reflect that I went above and beyond due diligence explaining why more ram was needed but was tired of arguing.",

I was approached by my general manager with an issue that one of my staff members was parking in the very front of the lot. \n\nThe GM took my employee and myself aside and discussed the importance of parking in the back to free up closer space. The employee responded “okay. I’ll park where I’m suppose to.”\n\nWhat the GM didn’t know is that this employee was still going through a rehab program for his knee surgery and had a valid placard. So he walked outside and moved his car one spot closer into the handicap spot and placed his placard on the rear view mirror. He went up to the GM and said “instead of taking up a spot for 8 hours for people who can walk.  I’m now taking up a spot for 8 hours for people who can’t.”  ",

        "text": "So some family members bought a small island a while back to live on. They went to great lengths when they were deciding to buy it to make sure that they could build a bridge over to it (it's &lt;400ft across, I don't think there were even going to be center supports needed IIRC). It was going to be a small, tasteful, blend-in-with-the-scenery kind of bridge that no one would see (they are very Earth-friendly people). They were 90% of the way through getting it approved including signoff from the Parks, transportation authority, even a nearby aboriginal council. Everyone was happy, so they bought the island and started to renovate the house on it. Then out of nowhere comes in an intern at city hall or something who is like \"woah, wait, there are new rules in that area, it's a historical area, no building within 500ft of the shore line. DENIED.\"\n\nSo they were a bit put out, not wanting to have to row a boat over to their house every night after work (might be nice mid-day, but think carrying groceries at 8pm and it's raining). So the brainstorming starts. We had silly ideas everything from catapults to giant slides going each direction. Until I suggested they just buy a 400ft yacht and park it sideways. Drive on one side, drive off the other. This was shot down because you can't dock anything that doesn't leave at least 5ft (or something like that) of open water in the middle of the channel for small boats to pass through. So how about 2 boats with a tiny drawbridge between them? Well now we're talking. \n\nFast-forward another half hour of talking and we're at the final solution they are happily using right now. 5 normal sized pontoon boats, with 3 linked together parked on one shore and 2 linked together and parked on the other, and a small drop bridge in the middle. Each boat is properly licensed and has all the tags and everything. Every summer they drop a small motor on a couple of them and take them for a drive around the lake. No one can say they aren't boats, and there's nothing against docking boats in a straight line across the water as long as you leave open water in the middle. This is my favorite malicious compliance story from my own life so far.\n\nEDIT: There seems to be confusion over the word \"boat\". I mean it in the most technical definition. It's like [those wooden things](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/ae/0c/b8/ae0cb8441ccf2fbe52389329e32a6e1a--swim.jpg) people anchor just off shore at a cottage or beach to dive from, but a bit bigger and with a rail on 2 opposing sides.\n\nEDIT 2: It seems my numbers are a bit off, I was thinking it was 125m (400ft), but I think it's actually more like 125ft. [These are the 5 boats](https://i.imgur.com/GrHEBpV.jpg), so judge the size for yourself. The water is those 5 boats plus a 6-10ft center gap wide.",

It was a fun job and was out of the scorching southern heat, something I was very grateful for (100+ Temps with 100‰ humidity makes for a miserable experience. The only downside was a local business man's wife we'll call platinum or \"P\" for short (for her unnatural blonde hair). See P's husband owned a local construction company and  was a very nice and respected man. He was very successful, which allowed P to stay at home and \"socialize\" with other trophy wives. P, unlike her husband, was rude, demanding and very much condescending. P regularly came in mailing letters for luncheons or cocktail parties. P always insisted on myself and the PM drop everything because her mail was \"very important\".\n\nWell, one glorious day, PM &amp; I were able to maliciously comply and bring P down to earth. It was a Friday near closing before a major holiday (I can't remember which one) meaning we were going to be closed on the following Monday. In strolls P in all her glory. P drops a stack of letters on the desk and says \"I need stamps, NOW! I just HAVE to get these invitations to our yearly BBQ out ASAP!\"\n\nKnowing we were going to be closed for the holiday I was trying to finish my work and not leave anything undone. I told her I'd be with her in just a minute. Well this displeased her and she mumbled something about \"poor people not understanding the importance of time and she COULDN'T miss her nail appointment\".\n\nPM overheard this walks up nonchalantly. He asks what he can do for her and she says \"thank God, I don't know if HE was ever going to get to me, he's working SO slow\".\n\nPM counts her letters (about 15). He does this twice just to make sure, which P took as a personal assault on her \"time\" it seemed because she said \"could you hurry up, I have places to be\". Stamps were 29 cents so she owed $4.35. P hands over a ten and PM begins to count her change before grabbing her stamps (they were in a locked drawer and he asked me to get the key off his desk). Well poor PM accidently drops the coin portion of her change. This was the final straw for P. She screams \"OMG can I just have my four dollars... and thirty five cents worth of stamps so I can get going?!\"\n\nBy this time, I've returned with the key and PM is barely containing his rage (only time I saw him angry).\nHe calmly takes the key from me, opens the drawer and grabs a stack of the 1 cent stamps. Enough stacks to equal 435, with a few more for good measure.\n\nPM then places them on the counter in front of P, along with her exact change and says \"Have a good weekend.\" PM then looks at me, then the clock, and says \"weekend time Rasfiki\" and pulled down the metal blinds. The last glimpse I had of P was one of pure shock. I'll never forget it. She came in the next week and was a different person. She never acknowledged the incident and made sure to never rush me or PM again.\n\nTL:DR\nRude, stay at home socialite comes in and demands $4.35 in stamps for her 15 letters, receives 435 one cent stamps instead of  15 twenty nine cent stamps.

They both order their sandwiches, the #13 which is all veggies and cheese and the #10 which is meat and cheese.  \n\nThe sandwiches slide down the line, I put the cheese on the #13 and the meat and cheese on the #10. All is good.  \n\nUntil I pick up the meat and Cheese sandwich and wrap it. And do the same to the veg and cheese.   \n\n13: excuse me!\nMe: Hi, how can I help you? Here's your order (in a bag).\n13: did you just touch that vegetarian sandwich after the meat sandwich? \nMe: ...yes\n13: I'm a vege- I'm allergic to meat! This is unacceptable.

New aprons and gloves for the crew on the line? Check.  \n\nThis was during the lunch rush, where we typically make about $1000 from 11 AM to 2 PM. This means a high volume of traffic and a long line. This woman (and the rest of the line) waited about 6 extra minutes for her sandwich when 1 sandwich is supposed to take 30 seconds to make. She also complained about me to my manager. He told her that I had followed corporate's rules regarding allergies. Never came back?   \n\nI was a vegetarian for 4 years and then a vegan for 2.5. You can't just say you're allergic to meat...just let the cashier know you're a vegetarian and we would have wrapped the veggie and cheese first. But instead, you get malicious compliance because you insisted you're allergic to all meat after telling me you are, in fact, a vegetarian.  \n\nTldr; woman who ordered veggie sandwich is mad I touched a meat sandwich before her sandwich (on a line style counter) and demands I remake it according to allergy specs. I take 6 extra minutes just for her during lunch rush. She never returns.\n\nEdit: formatting ",

I thought it may be pretty interesting to hear what he was talking about and was generally looking forward to working at the event. His staff was also there and they were incredibly rude. We were working outside the seminar hall but the event was streamed to TV's in our area. Everytime we would walk by a TV his staff turned the volume off on the TVs so we could not hear what Christian Bischoff was saying. Now we found that really ridiculous. Now my job that day was selling coffee in the breaks and setting up the food in the meantime. So the break starts and everyone comes out. This was only a really small break (10 minutes) and i give this guy his coffee and he proceeds paying with a 5€ bill. His friend goes \"nono you heard what christian just said! All your 5's should be saved and spent on becoming richer\". So he gives me a 10€ bill and I give him his change.\n\nNow i found that really funny and told my boss about it (we were really cool with each other). She goes \"Give me 5 minutes\" and walks off laughing. She comes back with a lot of 5€ bills and takes everything else out of the cash register.\n\nThe next break starts and people pay me for a coffee with 50's or even 100's because most of the people were rich business people. The event actually cost 600€ to attend or something silly. The way they looked at me when they got all 5's back was the best thing ever. Sometimes i closed with \"happy saving\". This went on for the entire day because the event lasted like 6 hours...\n\n[This guy here explains the \"5€ saving principle\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3I1FaHLha4)\n\n[And this is the motivation coach i was talking about](https://www.christian-bischoff.com/)",

That is my main responsibility, mediating between the government and the industry sides. \n\nRecently my company got taken over by a bigger guy, they think we are lying about some things that leave our site without my approval. They even have the audacity to accuse me of selling product on the down low and pocketing the money. They come up with a new policy to have me report all products coming into or out of my yard. When they notified me about this change, they told me to report everything. So I am now keeping meticulous notes on EVERYTHING that enters or leaves the job site. All the stuff I was doing previously? Documented. All the outgoing product I didn't need to care about before? Documented. Employees coming in for shift change? Documented. Some guy missed his exit and turned around in our driveway? You better believe that got documented, in triplicate.\n\nPaper and ink usage have increased by at least 10X. The best part is of course the guy that demanded we start documenting everything now has to go over everything I report and find it on the security cameras to verify. Last I heard he has been quietly trying to get this policy reversed. Others affected by this policy have actually been by to thank me since my meticulous records make their record keeping much easier. \n\nTLDR: New boss orders me to report everything, so I report every minute detail I am aware of.",

I honestly don't feel like I \"owe\" him anything at this point in my adult life, nor have I ever relied on him for anything (e.g. financial help or parental guidance).  We also grew up fairly poor, so allowance and gifts weren't really a thing.  My childhood weekends and school vacations were spent working at my mom's restaurant for free (12+ hours a day), so I somewhat earned my keep in case anyone wants to use the \"your parents put a roof over your head and food in your stomach\" argument. \n\nFast forward 30 years.  In my culture, it's customary to give cash in a card instead of a gift.  Depending on the occasion, I'd usually give around $200-$500. I never really liked giving my dad money because he just took it for granted and he never reciprocated.  I just did so to keep in line with the culture and not be the black sheep of the family.  \n\nOne father's day a few years ago, I was working long hours and totally forgot to prepare his gift and was running late to the dinner.  Zero time to pick up a card or get cash from the bank.  I made do with what I had...grabbed a blank envelope from my office and stuffed the last $100 bill I had in my wallet into the envelope.  \n\nDinner goes by as usual and gifts are given to my dad.  As we're leaving the restaurant, my dad pulls me aside, away from the family.  He pulls out my torn envelope out of his pocket and shows me the $100 bill I gave him.  He said, and I quote, \"Do you think I need $100?  What am I going to do with $100?  If you're going to give me this little, you're better off giving me nothing at all!\"  He was obviously expecting more cash and this was his loving way of telling me I was being cheap.  I was honestly kind of shocked by his extremely rude comment and just shrugged and walked away.  \n\nI relayed what happened to my mom later that week.  She is much more understanding and she said exactly what I felt...that he should appreciative of anything I give him, especially since he literally gives me nothing when my special occasions come around.  That being said, I told her I would heed his advice and never give him anything at all.  My mom thought I was joking, but I was serious.  \n\nMy dad's birthday dinner rolls around and I stayed true to my word and literally got him nothing.  I didn't come completely empty handed though because I brought some paperwork my mom wanted me to review in an envelope.  When she walked past me to use the restroom, I handed her the envelope which she placed in her purse.  \n\nAccording to my mom, my parents got home and were going over the gifts my dad received and he mentioned that he didn't see anything from me.  ...but, wait!  He said he saw me give my mom an envelope during dinner.  Could that be his mystery cash present?  NOPE! My mom let him know that it was just her paperwork.  I rarely talk to my dad, even when I see him on special occasions.  Haven't brought him a single gift in years and he hasn't said a word about it.  \n\nTL;DR Dad never gives me gifts, but complained what I gave him as a gift wasn't enough.  Said he'd rather receive nothing than something that small, so now he receives nothing.  ",

        "text": "Alright, I’ve spent a better portion of my day binge\\-reading this sub, and I think I may have a story for you. Let me know if I should post this elsewhere. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nAnyway, this happened back when I was a senior in college. My professor for what I will refer to as Class X, was known to be a tough grader. In fact, he was one of THOSE educators who believed that “nothing is perfect” and therefore NO ONE could ever get a 4.0 on an assignment, even if the rubric indicated otherwise. In fact, he took it a step further and the highest grade that he admitted to giving was a 3.5. This was because he considered a 3.75 to be akin to a second draft of a publishable paper. However, he said that if any one of us was to pass in a paper that could earn a 3.75 or higher, he would include it in his syllabus as an example for students.\n\nNow, this gave me a moment of pause. My grade for Class X was solely dependent upon four essays, a mid\\-term, and a final exam. Each essay was about 15&amp;#37; of your total grade and each one required extensive research and reading multiple textbooks \\(like actual, cover\\-to\\-cover reading and not just skimming for relevant information\\). Getting less than a 3.0 on these papers could hurt my grade and jeopardize my scholarship. However, I decided to chalk it up to the typical professorial bluster of hot air that begins each new semester. \n\nSo, the time for the first essay comes. For once I didn’t procrastinate and put a great deal of effort into the paper. Well, at least I thought I did. I get it back a few weeks later, and while I did pass, I didn’t do as well as I thought I should. Curious as to why, I double\\-checked the rubric and read his revisions. Essentially, the reasoning behind my less\\-than\\-stellar grade essentially boiled down one comment, “GrumpyPetunia, this paper is very well written, but I need you to include more sources and footnotes to get to the next level”. \n\nAt this point I fly into a righteous nerd rage. My bibliography is PAGES long and every page of this stupid paper has at\\-least five succinct footnotes, which is the norm in every academic journal I can find in this subject… I’m done. This man was willing to potentially tank people’s scholarships…for freaking footnotes! OK FINE. If he wants footnotes, I WILL GIVE HIM FOOTNOTES. \n\nSo, for my next essay, I create an absolute masterpiece of pettiness and spite. This paper is 35 pages long, has an additional 12\\-page bibliography, and half of every page is taken up by footnotes. EVERY. SINGLE. PAGE. If memory serves, my longest footnote took up an entire page! At this point, I knew I might be risking my grade, but I was simply following directions!\n\nNo sound to this day has been more satisfying than the heavy “THUMP” of this monstrosity landing on his desk, knowing that he had to read it, grade it, and return it to me within a week. Never again would he threaten a poor student’s grade with a professed, “lack of footnotes”, after having to slog through what I had written!  \n\nA couple of days later, I get an email asking me to stop by his office. He wants to discuss my paper. I schedule a time and walk over to his office looking as pleased with myself as the cat who ate the canary. I take a seat and he’s looking stern. Alright, I thought, I’m about to be torn a new one. I put on my best “innocently\\-worried\\-student” face and prepared for the tirade. He was quiet for a few more moments, but then he slowly stars to smile…and it’s the biggest shit\\-eating grin that I’ve ever seen. My face quickly loses its “innocently\\-worried\\-student” façade and was quickly replaced by my “definitely\\-guilty\\-and\\-highly\\-stressed\\-student” face. I’ve never been good under pressure. Sue me.\n\nHe smiles and informs me that he was SO PLEASED with my paper and that it was so well\\-written that he was giving me a 3.75! He was going to be passing out copies of this paper to my current classmates who were struggling and include it in his syllabus so future students can read it too. \n\nAll of my cocky arrogance that came with being a mildly successful student evaporated that day. I learned the hard way while that the young may be full of piss and vinegar and willing to spend HOURS on finding ways to be maliciously compliant with their elders, old folks have enough wisdom and trickery to turn it back on them…all while still being completely compliant with their own rules. \n\nMy footnote infested paper lives on in infamy, and continues to be inflicted upon new generations of students to this day. \n\n**TL;DR**: Had a stingy professor that refused to give high grades because “nothing is perfect”, but DID promise to include a paper in his syllabus as an example to future students if it could come close . Didn’t score well on my first essay due to not having enough footnotes. Write an enormous paper comprised of 70&amp;#37; footnotes out of pettiness and spite. Hand in paper and think I've won. Receive the highest grade in class history and the professor now includes the essay in his syllabus. Graduate with egg on my face as my professor had turned my maliciously compliant essay into his OWN malicious compliance and continues to inflict my monstrosity upon others. ",

        "text": "I work at a feed store. For those of you who don’t know what that is, it’s a store where people go to buy feed for livestock, cows, pigs, goats and other animals of that sort. Our main feed is, of course, hay. Hay bales weigh anywhere from 80-120 pounds, depending on the type of hay. \n\nI’m the manager at this feed store, and have a very close relationship with the owner. \n\nWe have a regular at this store, let’s call her K. K is a trophy wife, and her body is filled to the brim with as much silicone as one plastic surgeon would allow. She is a huge complainer, and constantly whines about our products. For the years I’ve worked there, I’ve always been super nice to her and listened to her complaints. But lately, she’s been going a little overboard. She came in earlier this week to buy some hay. She comes in and pays, and then backs her truck up to the hay barn. I walk in to load her 10 bales, and when I drop her tailgate I see that her truck bed is full of junk. I then tell her that I won’t be able to fit 10 bales in her truck, unless she cleans it out. \n\nK then says: “I’ve fit 20 like this before. Don’t tell me what to do, just do your job and load up the hay.”\n\nI comply, and start to load up the hay, smashing everything in the truck. Every time I lay one down, I hear crunching from plastic and wood snapping. I pay no mind. After all, this is what she wanted. I finish loading and she drives away.\n\nShe comes back later that day and runs into the store absolutely livid. Apparently I smashed a “precious family heirloom,” which turned out to be a rocking chair. She demands a compensation of... 700 dollars. She also complains that 2 of the bales fell out of her truck while she was driving, and she didn’t have the chance to stop and turn around, leaving two whole bales of hay in the middle of the road, and demands compensation for those 2 bales also. This is how the conversation went.\n\nK: “It’s unbelievable how this store is run. You don’t care at all about your customers, you’re rude and selfish!”\n\nMe: “I am sorry about this, but I told you that you needed to clean out your truck. You told me just to throw the bales on top of all the junk, so I did. I was only doing what you asked.”\n\nK: “I don’t care. Call the owner. Now. I refuse to speak to you anymore.”\n\nShe goes and sits in her car, and I call the owner and explain to him the situation. He lives right down the road from the store, so he was there in less than 5 minutes. He walks into the store, with K following behind him. She tells him that she told me to “be careful of the valuables in the back of the truck.” I then tell the owner what actually happened, and she began screaming at me and calling me a liar. The owner asks to see the chair. I follow them outside to see the chair. The chair was buried under all kinds of buckets, children’s toys, and other junk. The chair itself was absolutely demolished. He looks at the chair, and when he goes to pick it up it falls apart even more. Of course, this sends K into a blind rage. She’s yelling and screaming, and my boss and I were just standing there silently watching her. \n\nAfter she’s done, my boss just says: “He told you that you needed to clean out your truck.”\n\nShe then continues yelling, and eventually my boss tells her to leave. As she drove away, she threw an egg at the front of the store. My boss and I have a good laugh about it and he buys me lunch.\n\nTL;DR: Lady with a bunch of junk in her truck told me to just throw 10 bales of hay on top of it. I destroy a family rocking chair, and she drops two bales on the road. She demands compensation and my boss tells her to leave. He buys me lunch.",

We don't have a lot of money for fancy things like new computers, and so a good number of our computers are 5-7 years old. Every year we get a small budget to replace the oldest computers in the building with Dell's latest model.\n\nRecently, a graduate student with a track record of being rude and disrespectful came to my office and demanded he get a new computer right now, because he is a \"tuition-paying student who should not have to use a 7-year-old computer\". I said, I'm sorry but we don't have any newer ones right now, but if you'll wait a few weeks we'll be able to help you out. Of course that wasn't good enough for him, he is in the thick of his research and needs it *right now*. He went on a tirade and called my team incompetent in some colorful language, and made a point that even *he* could do our job better than we do.\n\nImmediately after he left, he went to the university surplus warehouse and picked up a \"new\" computer along with an ancient 24\" monitor, brought it all to our office, and demanded that we set it up for him. The desktop that he brought is about 5 years old and is equipped with a Core i5, 4GB of RAM, and an 80GB hard drive, but still (sadly) probably an upgrade from what he had.\n\nSo I provided him with excellent customer service and set that computer up for him the very same day, apologized for the earlier inconvenience, and he was happier than a pig in shit...\n\n... until 2 weeks later, when the rest of his office mates got brand new computers, with Core i7s and dual 27\" monitors. He was, of course, no longer eligible for an upgrade because we only upgrade the oldest computers in the building.\n\nEnjoy your new computer for the next 2 years, asshole.",

        "text": "This is my earliest memory that I have of some malicious compliance.\n\nIt was 1999, I was in Pre-K. Even though our classroom was directly across the hall from the bathrooms, because we were all 4 and 5 years old, we were required to have a teacher accompany us to the bathroom. Kids who tried to leave the classroom on their own would get sent to time-out and wouldn’t get to participate in snack time, so this rule was obviously the most important thing ever.\n\nOn this day, I remember having to go to the bathroom particularly bad. I asked one of the teachers if she would walk me to the bathroom, but she told me I needed to wait because she was busy at the moment helping someone with classwork. I had a bad habit of holding in my pee, so when I would say I needed to go, I needed to go. After a minute or so of doing the potty dance, I shyly inched toward the door.\n\nThe teacher noticed me trying to sneak out and said, “I said you need to wait! If you open that door, you’ll be in trouble!”\n\nI couldn’t take it any longer, but no way did I want to break the rules. So, right where I stood by the door, I locked eyes with the teacher and peed my pants. Two decades later and I can still remember the look on her face.\n\nI just shrugged and said,  “I told you I had to pee!”\n\nWhile the other teacher escorted me to my cubby to get my spare clothes (all kids had spare clothes for these situations), I watched the bathroom-denier on her knees cleaning up my pee. With a paper towel.\n\nI still got my midday animal crackers, too.",

        "text": "Hi! Nice to meet you all, LTL, FTP.\n\nTL;DR at the end.  \n\n\nWell, to put into context, this happened about 10 years ago at college, I studied in a private school, and always worked through my degree in order to survive, so I had a little bit of a problem with attendance sometimes.  \n\n\nThis professor was the typical Scumbag Steve, only passing those who gave him a bottle of whisky or if you were a cute chick and flirted with him. Let's call him **SS**. He liked to be *too* personal with students, passing the border of respect a lot of times and for this particular time at the beginning of the term, he messed with me and I had woken up on the wrong side of the bed.  \n\n\nThat day I had to ask about something I didn't understand about client/server relationship (It was a Server Interpreted Languages class):  \n\n\n&gt; @me: Excuse me professor, but I don't understand this part, can you explain again?  \n&gt; @SS: Next time study before you ask, my time is expensive so I can't waste it.  \n\n\nIt struck a nerve and made me fade in the background like an episode of \"Earth, swallow me whole right now please\".  \n\n\nSo... being the freaking nerd I was, did **EXACTLY** what he asked and studied... real hard, until I finished the class program in the second week of the term, it was really outdated, like 10 years old, *sooo*, I updated the content I acquired to the knowledge state of the art.  \n\n\nSo cue me in the next class, he mentions something wrong (not outdated), and I ask him about it to make sure it wasn't by mistake (anyone can make a mistake):  \n\n\n&gt; @me: Excuse me professor, but this part doesn't quite fit to what the content says, can you clarify?  \n&gt; @SS: I told you already to study beforehand!  \n&gt; @me: That's why I'm asking, because according to *Standarization Organization* what you're saying is wrong. Besides, you're outdated, this was 10 years ago, now changed to *this* (I don't remember exactly, lol).  \n&gt; @SS: We'll see in the tests if I'm outdated.  \n\n\nBut I took all chances I could to humiliate him in front of the class.  \n\n\nIn each test I had to request a revision because he would always fail me, but the most important one was the final... and I had to go through the Dean of my faculty to get my grade because no matter what I did, he would always fail me, I had to take a picture (had a camera phone) to everything I handed in, and this included him receiving it (he didn't know I was, because camera phones were really rare).  \n\n\nAfter the final revision by the Dean of Computer Sciences, my grade was 100, and fortunately had the time to shut his mouth one last time.  \n\n\n&gt; @me: If you teach, make sure you know more than your students.  \n\n\nAnd just left. He got sacked by the next term, why? Performance review score.  \n\n\nTL;DR: College programming professor undermines student to look cool, student was nerd of the class, studied hard and humiliated the teacher for the rest of the term in front of the class and the faculty dean.  \n\n**EDIT: Formatting**",

It's a lot harder than it seems, ESPECIALLY since customers will fuck up an area you just cleaned without caring. Also, a lot of the displays are poorly designed. I don't have steady hands, so I could knock over entire rows of things on accident. It was incredibly frustrating.\n\nOne of the company policies was to take any customer to the location of whatever item they were looking for. Since I had an entire set of aisles to clean up, and less than enough time to do it all, I wouldn't usually do that. I would tell them where it was with amazingly specific directions, and the customers were usually fine with it.\n\nOne of the shift leads (SL) was pissed though. She was all about customer service (to the detriment of our actual jobs). She would randomly survey customers to see if we were doing things correctly. Example:\n\nSL: Excuse me, Customer (C), did aloneindankness greet you as you entered the area?\n\nC: *acting offending* No, she did not!\n\nMe: *literally torso deep in a freezer* I'm sorry, did you say something?\n\nThat kind of thing. They paid minimum wage, but they expected you to do impossible feats for the customers.\n\nAnyway, SL got on my case about not taking customers to the location of what they were looking for. I was getting really tired of her shit, so I apologized and said I would do that from now on.\n\nAs you might know, Bullseye Logo Store is HUGE. Mine was no different. So I would be working in the bedding area, for example, and someone would ask me where a specific toy was. I would walk them to the toy aisle, and someone there would want to know where this medicine was. I would walk them to the medicine, and it would go on. I wasn't seeking customers out, and I would walk all the way back to my section every time, unless someone interrupted.\n\nI got through maybe one of my entire section (twenty ish) aisles. I walked all over that store, to the point that my legs were absolutely aching. The shift lead for that shift (different person) was not happy with my work. I told them exactly what SL had told me, but they were still furious. I don't even remember what they expected me to do to solve the problem. To be honest, I think they just wanted me to be super humanly fast.\n\nA week later, they pulled me in for a meeting with HR. I was told that my probationary period was up (it wasn't, I had another month), and they had decided not to continue the contract. They handed me an envelope of cash (last pay check) and that was that.\n\nThe only good thing about this was that I had signed up to cover a LOT of shifts, including cashier shifts, in the coming weeks, and I failed to mention that to HR (shift coverage was self-regulated). Hopefully they had some shortages.",

Cashiers were supposed to advertise it as a way to get 5% off every purchase and to downplay the credit card part (until they agreed).\n\nAs a cashier, I was supposed to offer the card to EVERY customer. I didn't do that of course. A person buying a single package of gum or 3 bottles of vodka (and nothing else) isn't interested. In fact 90% of people aren't initially interested. Even if they are interested, they drop off when they learn it is a credit card.\n\nMy opinion is that offering this bs (and wasting the customer's time) is bad customer service. I don't care about what the company wants. They make enough money, and the customer just wants to get their stuff and go.\n\nAfter a while, one of the shift leads comes over and asks me to start advertising to customers. I am technically supposed to ask every customer, and I hadn't been. (I would ask sometimes if I actually thought they might be interested). She gets all angry about it, and tells me I have to ask EVERY customer.\n\nAlright, fine. I mean it is company policy, and I should follow the rules. So I start asking EVERY customer.\n\nThe guy buying only condoms? Yup\nThe mom with all her kids who is literally holding a kid while trying to pay? Yup\nEtc.\n\nI wouldn't just ask once. You are supposed to keep asking (basically try to badger them into it). People were not happy, and I know one complained, but they couldn't do anything about it.\n\nThis process slows the line down a LOT (another reason I don't do it), and god forbid someone actually say yes! The process takes 10-20 minutes, which is years in waiting-in-line time. (I only had one person say yes, out of EVERYONE.)\n\nThe shift lead couldn't even rescind. It's company policy, so she can't tell me to stop. That's why most shift leads just ignore it unless a rep is there.\n\nI left the job a little while later, but I kept doing it until the day I left.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,this is my first Malicious Compliance post. I work retail electronics, so I have a lot of stories but this one happened earlier this week. Hopefully I'm telling this well.\n\nAs I said, I work retail electronics in a big store. At the moment, we were resetting our department. This entails changing all the tags for new product and heavily discounting old product to move it out of the store. This includes TVs. I'm working the \"TV Wall\", a long wall of televisions across the back wall of the store. Because some are on sale and some new ones aren't, I've been steering customers to TVs that fit their price range (many people see the new ones and assume they're discounted when they aren't). \n\nI get called over by a woman and she points at a demo TV and tells me \"I want that one\". She asks me a lot of questions about the specifications, which I answer. She keeps interrupting me throughout, with a lot of \"I thought\" and \"well my husband said\", which I understand her having concerns, but she hardly let me get a word in edgewise. She does decide she wants it, though. We keep a lot of TVs below the demos but we didn't have any of this model on the floor.\n\nI tell her I'll run to the back and try and locate one, and if I find it I'll bring it out. So, off I go and I can't find them. Eventually, I locate a pallet of TVs up high (30ft up on some shelves) and load them down with a forklift type thing to get the very last one of that model. This isn't a super quick process and it's been maybe 5 minutes. I'm not stressing because I have several other co-workers out. To confirm it's the right TV, I scan the barcode and find that not only is it correct, but that it's around half off (used to be $850ish, now was around $400). I load it up on a flat cart and take it behind the counter. I then track down the woman (now looking at phones) and begin speaking.\n \nMe: \"good news, I found the TV in the back, looks like you're getting the last one!\"\n\nHer: \"Well it took you long enough, get me rung up, I'm a very busy person and don't have time for you to dawdle.\"\n\nI sign on to the register. Before I can scan it, she pulls up her phone and shows me our website with the TV listed. We don't price match anymore but we do match our website under certain cases. The kicker is, she had it listed for $700 on her phone, and we were selling it much cheaper.\n\nMe: \"ma'am, about that price mat...\"\n\nHer: \"no, I know your rules and it meets it. I don't want this TV for a penny more. You're going to price match it for me!\" \n\nMe: \"I was just going to inform you that...\"\n\nHer: \"No! I don't want you to inform me, I want you to sell me my goddamn TV!\". \n\nI shrug a bit and plug in the override. Whenever we get particularly weird price override requests (like selling it for more), the register prompts for a manager to turn a key to approve it.\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, but this override requires a manager to approve. It will automatically notify them and it shouldn't be more than a minute.\"\n\nHer: \"I told you I was on a tight schedule, go find one, yourself!\"\n\nThis was kind of reasonable, ish, but I'm still signed in to the register and have a TV out (store rules about leaving bugh dollar stuff unattended). So, somewhat bemused, I decide to have my coworker watch my register and I go find a manager. I run into one I'm good friends with and we chat for a few minutes while I explain the situation. He follows me back to the counter and attempts to explain the situation. Before he can speak, she starts talking.\n\nHer: \"finally, you have the slowest staff I've ever seen. Not only that, this employee here (me, directed towards my manager) keeps interrupting me. Very rude! I want this discount and I want it now.\" \n\nManager: \"Ok, I just want to make sure you want this TV for that price on your phone, and nothing else?\"\n\nHer: \"Yes. Now do it!\"\n\nManager looks at her, then me, raises an eyebrow, and turns the key to approve the transaction. The sale goes through and she buys a TV for $300 more than we see it because she wouldn't let me explain the TV was cheaper. Probably my most interesting sale of the day for sure.\n\nTL;DR rude woman wants a TV for more than it costs, I sell it to here",

        "text": "I used to work at a company that wrote virtual machine and server software. We used a bunch of old desktop PCs as test servers, because when you’re testing the code to do remote management of the things you need physical access to make sure the code’s doing what it says it is. They’re scattered around the unused cubicles outside our offices, with mouse, keyboard, the works. Basically, you look at them, you think it’s just somebody’s desktop system.\n\nSo one day someone notices an unexpected USB device while they’re testing. It’s not a bug; we look at the machine and there’s a smartphone connected to it.\n\nNow, it’s obvious what it is - it’s got the rubber case and dymo label of the phones the security guys have to tap to sensors on the wall to prove they’re making their rounds instead of, say, stealing snacks from our team stash. But a few years before this there had been a major code leak - which, judging by what was recovered, was code from several years before that, and had probably walked out the door with an employee - but it had prompted a major crackdown and various annoyances. And, of course, we’re still ticked off that we caught a security guard on webcam stealing our food and nothing was done about it.\n\nSo the engineer who’s least likely to crack up and spoil the game calls security to report the strange device that’s attached to one of our servers. Why, there are VMs on there, and software! For all we know, it’s been transmitting data to who knows where!\n\nSomeone higher up in security than the wall-tappers comes and collects the thing. We find out later that the wall tapper got dragged in and raked over the coals. His excuse was that he’d forgotten to charge it before starting work and thought that it was an unused cube so nobody would notice. As if people just leave computers powered on in vacant cubes.",
