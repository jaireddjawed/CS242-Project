        "text": "Alright, here we go:\n\nMy first watch was a Timex when I was 10, and I loved it to pieces.  No idea where it ended up - probably lost in one of many moves.  Stopped wearing watches for quite some time.\n\nA few other watches came and went, and a few I still have and will talk about a little whenever I do a SOTC post.\n\nA couple years ago (in my thirties, which I still am) as a tangent to my interests in everyday carry gear, I picked up a diver-style blacked out Timex Expedition.  It's a decent watch if all you need is a watch - there are several design elements I like about it and will talk about it more whenever I do a SOTC post.\n\nI've only recently (since last August) become interested in watches at a real \"enthusiast\" level. In most of my past hobbies I've jumped in head first before really understanding my own tastes, and I wanted to avoid that with watches.  So I told myself I would do my research, absorb all the info I could and really take my time with this watch thing.\n\nSo I've made a \"list\" of watches I want, and it's under constant revision though has stayed reasonably stable over the past while (gonna keep the list close to my vest at this time - I'll have to save for awhile to achieve the others but I will say that they are almost all mechanical after this). \n\nThere was always a G-Shock on that list, and it pretty quickly settled on THIS G-Shock - but again, wanting to be smart about how I tackle this hobby, I waited to pull the trigger.\n\nFinally, just before Christmas G-Shock Canada put the GMB2100BD-1A Full Metal \"CasiOak\" on sale for $500cad (regular price in Canada is $800cad) and I made the buy.  \n\nIt perfectly fills the roll of a GADA sports watch - supremely capable, great looking, and built to go through hell.  It's hard to capture in photos, but it has a great presence in real life - the full metal dial is executed beautifully.  The machined indices are a particular favorite of mine, as they have a great iridescent quality in direct sunlight.  I'll try to capture that in photos at some point.\n\nOverall I love this watch.  It feels fantastic on the wrist, just enough feeling of heft, the bracelet seems nicely executed and the various features make it a great all-round sports watch that doesn't get talked about nearly as much as it's less expensive resin counterparts.\n\nAlright I'm sure I've yammered for long enough.  Thanks for reading my first post on Reddit!",

It was available in blue too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first post on Reddit - I hope everything is accoring to the rules...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nDall0r",
