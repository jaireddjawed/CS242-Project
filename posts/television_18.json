        "author": "TheMisterManGuy",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/119raob/the_2000s_tween_boom_why_tween_makes_no_sense_as/",
        "text": "The mid to late 2000s was the peak of what was  considered \"tween\" media. That is, movies and tv shows for an audience  between children and teenagers that was \"too old for toys, too young for  boys\". The Disney Channel was a forerunner in this demographic with  smash hits like Hannah Montana, High School Musical, Camp Rock, The  Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Wizards of Waverly Place, That's So Raven,  Kim Possible, and many more. Nickelodeon also had its hits with iCarly,  Zoey 101, Drake &amp; Josh. These shows combine goofy sitcom antics and  childish gags, with hip teenage characters and pop music to make the  largely female child audience think they're watching something aimed at  teenagers.\n\nI've recently  revisited some of these shows (partly out of nostalgia), and upon more  and more research from this general time period of pop culture, it  dawned on me that \"tweens\" as a tangible demographic, makes no logical  sense. The general age range of what is considered \"tweens\" has changed  over the years and varies from person to person, but the most common age  groups cited are \"8 to 12\", \"10 to 12\", or \"9 to 13\", some go as low as  7 year olds.\n\nThe fact that  people can't agree on a specific age group for this concept shows how  flawed it is at its core. That's not to say the idea didn't start out  with good intentions. When Disney Channel first coined the term in the  late 90s, it was mainly to appeal to a niche of kids in middle school  who wanted a more family-friendly alternative to edgier channels like  MTV, which were starting to become popular at that age, but not all kids  felt comfortable with just yet. But then that strategy became too  successful, and suddenly marketeers and toy companies used it as an  excuse to try and sell parent-friendly teen-esque lifestyles to 9 year  olds.\n\nSo middle schoolers  feel like the most accurate description for what the concept of \"tween\" would entail (in between childhood and teenhood). But here's the thing,  Middle school in the US is generally aged 11 to 13, or 10 to 14  depending on your birthday. That's quite a bit older and more narrow  than the age groups that are usually cited when referring to tweens. On  top of that, middle school has always been a notoriously tricky age group when discussing what exactly is \"appropriate\" for that age, due to just how shattered kids are at that age (both psychologically and  physically) thanks to puberty. If you look at any middle school, in any grade, you see a bunch of kids already dating, sneaking drugs, and  talking about adult topics, and then you also have a bunch of kids who  still play with Hot Wheels and Rolblox, or still believe in cooties, and then a bunch of kids who don't fit in on eitther extreme. It's a giant  melting pot, and perhaps the hardest age group to find one size-fits all stuff for compared to younger children or teenagers.\n\nBut I think the ultimate problem with \"tween\" media during this time, was  that it never was a true middle ground between content for kids, and  content for teenagers. There's a really good video on YouTube discussing  this problem comparing a tween show to a teen show, and how drastic the  difference in tone and content is. Where you can instantly go from  squeaky-clean kidcoms, to raunchy, brooding dramas filled with tons of  sex, drugs, and violence.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxK9G4Q92D0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxK9G4Q92D0)\n\nBasically, the question boils down to, why was there  never any middle ground between \"iCarly\" and \"Gossip Girl\"? To me, the  closest has always been anime. Anime fandom in my view at least, often  peaks during middle school because it's often that middle ground between  \"kids shows\" and \"teen shows\" that you don't find much of in  American-made pop culture, particularly with Shonen and Shojo. Something  like One Piece, Full Metal Alchemist, or newer stuff like My Hero  Academia were a nice combination of colorful worlds, humor, and sense of  adventure and optimism found in children's shows, with still having  more mature themes and content that kids in middle school start to  crave, while also not going too far in themes in content that parents of  a 12 or 13 year old would worry about.\n\nPoint  is, I feel like there has always been kid of a lack of a between \"Kids  stuff\" and \"Teens stuff\" in media, and that \"tween\" over time, just  started becoming an excuse to let 8 year old girls pretend they're teenagers.",

The Walking Dead: I understand that the show still had huge numbers when it ended, but I barely heard any mainstream media discuss its series finale. Even as someone who used to watch the show, I couldn't tell you how it all ended.\n2. Empire\n3. Handmaid's Tale: A critics and award darling in its first few seasons, people barely talk about it anymore outside of its own subreddit. As much as I tried, I couldn't bring myself to watch the new season as I really have no interest in the story (and June) anymore.",
