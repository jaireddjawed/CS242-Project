        "text": "Hello,\n\nIt is pretty known that Insulin Resistance is caused by constant spikes in glucose which forces the pancreas to create more insulin which eventually leads to insulin resistance.\n\nFoods that cause high spikes in glucose are high on the Glycemic Index. These includes bagels, sugary drinks, potatoes etc.\n\nWhen I look at the people around me, they’re constantly eating foods high on the glycemic index or meals with high glycemic loads, yet they seem perfectly fine?\n\nFor example, I’ve got a coworker who eats 2 bagels every morning, McDonalds for lunch (fries, sugary drink, and a burger and sometimes gets a pastry). Not sure what he eats for dinner, but he often talks about his pasta or peanut butter rice meals.\n\nHow come my coworker wouldn’t eventually develop insulin resistance? He doesn’t have any of the risk factors, though. He’s in shape (healthy weight range) and goes to the gym (but he’s not very consistent)\n\nAnd when you think about this in a broader sense, a lot of Americans eat foods and have a diet that lead to glucose spikes… so why isn’t there an Insulin Resistance epidemic?\n\nI guess it could be because they don’t meet the other risk factors such as obesity, lack of exercise etc.",

        "text": "Apologise in advance if there are other Reddit forums where I should ask this.\n\nBut for example there is this product, where the nutritional label says:\n\n1,2g of salt per dose\n\nAs I understand only 39% of this is sodium, meaning 1 dose has 0,468 grams of sodium or 468 mg\n\nThen the label continues to break it down, and at the end it says 329 mg of sodium per dose\n\nDoes this mean that I have to add 468 + 329 to know the total amount of sodium content in 1 dose? If the number of sodium listed was higher then the amount of sodium present in the salt listed I would assume it was included, but since its a smaller amount, I need some help. By the way this a a pre workout with extensive labelling, in case it changes anything.\n\nOn a more natural product, lets say spinach this time, it says 0,19g of salt on the label. Do I calculate the sodium in it, and add to a sodium number in spinach per 100g label on the web? Or are those 0,19g of salt indicative of all the sodium the product has? Or is it added on top of the product?\n\nIDK if I made it clear what my doubt is or if is already been answered somewhere, but I have not found it.\n\nThanks",

        "text": "Hi all, I’ve recently started counting calories and feel like I’m being a dumbass when it comes to calorie values shown on nutrition labels.\n\nMost things show calories per 100g (cooked). So for example I had a stew the other day that was all ingredients in a box you put them all in the slow cooker. It was 1kg, when I made the stew and weighed it it was roughly 700g. So when I’m counting my calories and put 350g of stew on a meal. Am I doing 3.5x the 100g cooked value or am I doing 5x100g since it is half of the total weight when cooked. \n\nOr for example oven chips, so again it is per 100g cooked. So I put 250g of frozen chips In, when cooked and I put them on my plate it’s 180g. When I count calories am I doing 2.5x 100g or 1.8x 100g. \n\nProbably just being a massive dumbass here but some help would be appreciated thanks.",

I know evolution is not that simple but I don't see why our taste centers would evolve to find salt more desirable than other things we need in much larger quantities.\n\nOther examples are calcium which we need ~1000mg of a day or phosphorus which we need 700mg per day. Why does salt taste so much better than these minerals which we need more of (and which have probably been less easily accessible in our evolutionary environment, e.g. calcium which is pretty much only obtainable from bones/bone marrow and possibly cruciferous vegetables, though those are not growable in many regions)\n\nNotice that I haven't compared to macronutrients which we need in much larger quantities like carbs because it is not an obviously true assertion that salt tastes better than carbs, though it is still strange that they are even comparable in desirability when we need so much more carbs than salt.\n\n*TLDR:* Why have we evolved to find salt so tasty and addictive compared to other nutrients which we need more of and/or which were much rarer? Shouldn't the amount we like a food be proportional to how much of it we need and/or how rare it is?",

        "text": "Hey, i have a question. Im buying pork,chicken etc. pretty often. I never weight it raw, i mean i cook meat for many days of meals, so i want to weight it cooked every day alone. Problem is, calories (protein etc.) is informed in 100g of \"raw\" meat. From what i understand, after cooking it (im just boiling it) the same weight (100g) of cooked meat will be in reality more caloric dense, because it lost some weight due to cooking, so 100g of cooked meat is in reality like 150-200g of raw meat for example ? Is there any guide on how to know (circa) the calories in cooked state ? Ty",
