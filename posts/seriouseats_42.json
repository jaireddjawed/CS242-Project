I love using this recipe for cabin trips, as I make the chili paste at home, and just bring it up in a tupperware container, meaning less hassle with regards to packing/transport and cooking at the cabin.\n\n\nHowever, six people of the group are vegetarians. I figured I would accomodate this by removing the anchovies from the chili paste, and then creating a larger chili con carne batch and a smaller chili sin carne batch at the cabin by splitting up the chili paste. I will then add chopped anchovies into the chili con carne recipe a bit later in the process, which should be fine.\n\n\nThe remaining question is then: What can I add to the chili sin carne batch to make it a bit more exciting/beefier? I feel like serving the vegetarians the exact same dish, just removing animal products is a lazy approach. Some ideas I have thought of so far are adding sweet potato, mushrooms or roasted pumpkin. Anyone here have any suggestions/experience with what makes for a great chili sin carne?\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all the great responses so far! Just to clarify, when I said 'beefier' I just meant that that there was something there to create interesting texture/taste, resembling actual beef is in no way a goal here, I just want to create something delicous in its own right. \n    ",

Anyone use this pibil method to cook turkey before?  Any recipe recommendations?  Thinking i'll need to introduce some sort of fat to make it as tender as the pork.  My fear is the traditional method will dry out the turkey.  Thinking it might be better to do this in dutch oven.

        "text": "So I have been looking around for a good carne guisada recipe, as it is one of my favorite dishes. I have tried a few and they just aren't very good. If you've never had it, it is basically a Mexican beef stew, but you eat it taco style wrapped up in a delicious flour tortilla. Sooo good!\n\nAnyway, I couldn't find a recipe for it on the serious eats website, so I thought I would ask y'all if you have a good recipe for it. Thanks!",

I had bought an Instant Pot recently, and picked up all of the ingredients except:\n\n* I had fish sauce which I used in place of the anchovies\n* I had a Vidalia (sweet) onion which I used in place of pearl onions\n* I substituted 4 thin sliced habanero peppers for the peas\n\nThe final substitution was what made this a Mexican American Beef Stew for me.  I removed most of the pith and some of the seeds from the sliced habaneros.  Make sure to wash your hands or wear gloves when slicing and handling!  Finally, I tossed in about 30 peppercorns at the same time the habaneros were added.\n\nIt turned out wonderful.  I loved getting a random, soft peppercorn here and there, and the 4 habaneros did not make anything too hot.  http://i.imgur.com/L5NTIdr.jpg",

After pressure cooking the onions per his instructions, there was ALOT of liquid still from the onions. The directions said to reduce until liquid was completely reduced  (about 5 min), I ended having to reduce for about 15 before the liquid was anywhere near gone, but still wasn't \"sticky\" or browned. On top of that, the onions were literally obliterated; it was basically onion paste. The final flavor was nowhere near what I expect from an onion soup; the chicken stock was very pronounced and it didn't have that umami that I expect from a beefy broth. I even tried spiking it with some marmite to give it a boost, and while it helped, it still ended up tasting completely unlike onion soup. Where did I go wrong? Has anyone had success with this?",

This is not my first time hosting a large dinner party but it is my first Thanksgiving!\n\nOur plan right now is to do Kenji's 14lb spatchcook bird in the oven + 3 ~4lb boneless, skin-on turkey breasts on our Big Green Egg (we tried this last week and it was really good). We also need gravy and stuffing, and I'm going to follow the blueprints for those dishes from the cookbook as well.\n\nI have a few questions for those of you who have experience with these recipes:\n\n* Can you spatchcook the turkey in a roaster pan? Pros - I can make the gravy straight in the pan when it comes out of the oven on the stove. Cons - might not get enough air circulation and might not be large enough\n* Any recommendations for poultry shears?\n* How much gravy in terms of cups does the recipe make? I think I'll need to double or triple it at least. \n* Any recommendations for a vegetarian stock or broth for stuffing? I have one vegetarian who loves stuffing, so one dish will be veggie-friendly (blasphemy imho but sometimes we make sacrifices for our friends). I'm also making mushroom gravy for her",

Does that leave me with anything interesting?\n\nDinner is steak, red wine sauteed mushrooms, and roasted garlic mashed potatoes.",

The carrots were firm enough to add texture, but soft enough to yield easily to the tooth. The potatoes were similarly textured to the carrots, and each little cube had absorbed a bit of that exquisite gravy. The pearl onions added the barest hint of sweetness to offset all of the umami. My family doesn't like mushrooms, so I omitted them, but I'm sure that they would have been similarly amazing.\n\n57/10, would highly, highly recommend.",
