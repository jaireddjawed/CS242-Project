I have never taught or TAed anything like this before, but I have sat in on a stats for archaeologists course. \n\nI am still deciding on the textbook to use. As far as I can tell, there are basically two options:\n\n*Statistics for Archaeologists: A Common Sense Approach*, 2nd edition, by Robert D. Drennan\n\n*Quantitative Analysis in Archaeology Paperback* by Todd L. VanPool &amp; Robert D. Leonard \n\nI used Drennan's first edition extensively in the past and liked it a lot. I haven't looked much at the second edition but I think it can only be better than the first (greater coverage of material). This book has been used in the past for this course.\n\nBut then I found VanPool and Leonard's book. I like the look of it as well, and now I'm not sure which to go with. The price for both is similar.\n\nSo I'm soliciting opinions. Has anyone used these books either as a student or as a prof/TA? Do you have opinions on which is easier to understand and easier to teach? And which is easier for me? I'm not *super* strong with stats but I have taken courses and I have used certain statistical tests heavily in my own research. \n\nIn terms of learning objectives, I want the students to understand how different types of stats are better- or worse-suited for different types of data, how to critically evaluate the stats used in different studies, and how to choose which tests are best for testing various hypotheses. I would also like to use some real data for problem sets rather than hypothetical examples.\n\nI am leaning towards Drennan but I figured I would ask for thoughts here. Thanks!",

Geneticists attribute this to the prevalence of cousin marriage between descendants of two of the town's founders, Joseph Smith Jessop and John Y. Barlow; at least half the double community's roughly 8,000 inhabitants are descended from one or both.[21]\n\nSo this is a small town where most people are cousins with one another. The population is descended from two Mormons, and all that inbreeding has caused the people to suffer from severe intellectual disability.\n\nPeople with severe intellectual disability generally need to be cared for by other adults for their entire lives. If half the population is like this, how can the town survive? You can't really thrive if half a town's population is unable to work or do anything to contribute to the economy. Sounds like a pretty terrible place to live for the people who aren't related to those founders.",

My own immediate family consists of 4 siblings, though, and doing ancestry research, it seems most families in the 1800s and even until the 1940s had around 8 children.\n\nPresumably some of the difference can be accounted for planning based on desired number of kids and child survival rates, and contraception. However, I'm interested in the raw numbers as a starting point.\n\nSo, what's the deal? How many kids do humans REALLY have, on average, throughout history?\n",

But I know that we have sequenced Neanderthal DNA, so I presume we should have sequences of ancient human DNA. So I'm curious if we have DNA samples from perhaps Europe or northern Asia, or perhaps from the first Americans, or from Aboriginal Australians, that shares genetic characteristics of present day humans that may be living near those areas.\n\nDoing my own googling revealed one or two examples, a 28000 year old European DNA sequence for example, but I'm hoping people here may know of more examples.",

The sort of influence varies from invocation to outright magical control. This also manifests, as far as I know, in the form of taboos against speaking the names of certain entities, to avoid invoking them. One common feature is that the entity may not *tell* you its true name, to avoid giving you that power, instead identifying itself by a nickname or false name. \n\nIt also shows up in modern Japanese media like *Spirited Away*, though I know Miyazaki was heavily influenced by northern European folklore. I'm not sure if they had that concept before the modern period.\n\nHow widespread is this belief? Does it show up, for example, in any Native American traditions? Sub-Saharan Africa?\n\n(I know that sympathetic magic is widespread, where, say, having a bit of someone's hair gives you power over them. I'm interested specifically in spoken or written names.)",

Slovakia has a similar issue, as does Serbia. But Poland, Romania and the Baltic States don’t seem to have as much of the same issue.
