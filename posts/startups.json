I've been running the ship solo and at scarcity levels, until recently when a few large contracts renewed.\n\nUnfortunately I lost a decent 40k contract after a customer decided some instability during the transition was a bad sign and found a different solution.  Ultimately I feel they were right to do so, I should have had a better plan than trying to handle everything myself.  Contract help was ok at times but there was a real disconnect in their priorities because they weren't employees.\n\nI now have a decent amount of cash for operations, but I have some fairly big problems:\n\n* I have multiple code bases that are forked from the original, resulting in specific features being isolated and buggy inconsistent code.\n* I run this by myself, just recently my wife started helping with invoicing which was a god send, but I need dev and support help.\n* I have the basics of a nice rebrand, including a short .com url and logo.  I am proud of this and think bulldozing the old codebase with a modern SPA will wipe away bugs, increase usage, and the new UI\/brand identity will help attract users.\n\nI'm going to need some cash to solve these issues, and while I could spare some cash for external teams to do the rebuild and rebrand, I think I might prefer having more capital to build a team and also focus on growth.  I don't really want to beg for money, but if I felt the sacrifice was worth it, would I be at the seed level or need to approach Angels? Other tips on this route appreciated.\n\nI think my preferred route might be a working capital loan, I could probably swing 3-400k. There's also non-dilutive debt funding options.

It fits like a glove and has a proven history of high performance on similar products (eg: Whatsapp with Erlang). However, hiring for engineers with Elixir experience can be highly restrictive and may take a lot of time, if successful at all.

Spent 2 years building a product that's struggling heavily to get traction and I'm not quite sure why, but the point is, stop being perfect. I regret it with every fiber of my being. One more feature, 2px more precise, whatever. All this stuff doesn't matter.\n\nIf I could go back in time I'd build a landing page, a signup form, and a waiting list. The reason I didn't do this before is that I always thought \"what if I blow up, how the heck am I gonna build a product fast enough after I get a huge waiting list?\".\n\nBut the truth is, it's more likely nobody is gonna sign up for that waiting list than the contrary, so you risk more by building a fully working product than just building a waiting list and trying to come up with the product after that. The waiting list serves just as a validation tool for your idea, nothing more.\n\nThe truth is, marketing and getting users is way harder than it is advertised or publicly known. You only understand this once you actually start trying to get users.\n\n\\---\n\n**Edit**: also wanted to add that there's a \"toxic\" belief that developers like me have learned while working jobs or in university, the idea that you must create \"elegant\" solutions to your code problems, write clean code, and obsess over technical details.\n\nWhile I'm not saying you should write totally garbage code, be aware when you're trying to make things too perfect, because it takes a lot of time to write good code, and while you rack up tech debt if you don't do this, as I said, it's way more likely that nobody is going to use your product, so you should always keep that in mind when building something.\n\nMy new mindset is more pessimistic, whereas previously I almost had a conviction that my product was going to succeed, but it's not grounded in reality. Always assume you're going to fail, and you're gonna come up with an MVP without any mental legwork. Yes, it's gonna suck, but you're gonna save a lot of time wasted building the perfect code solution that nobody might end up using.\n\nWhat's better, having tech debt but a product a lot of people want to use and a lot of users, or having the perfect code every university professor loves but no users?

That said, if we have any growth of size, then scaling issues will make it difficult for me to self fund, given we are an entirely cloud based platform.\n\nI am a technology guy, first and foremost of course, and we built the architecture and framework for our platform and are guiding the development of it from overseas.

Obviously I can learn, and I'd like to grow the staff of the company to a reasonable level which alone I cannot do. The question really is whether an accelerator makes sense -- I have a family, I have a full time job, I can't be away from either of those things for months at a time -- or something else? And in talking with different folks I've heard a lot of different takes, some of whom think that a remote accelerator is a possibility, and some of whom think that build a product that shows the traction etc and go straight to VCs -- a process itself that I'm again, unfamiliar with.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts on this as I'm still full time in development world, but in my experience being prepared makes the most sense regardless.

It's hard to focus on where to begin work and what questions to ask people, but I have had a lot of success taking people through a process of how to understand your future customers.\n\n# 1) Don't get in the weeds\n\nI like to start with a really barebones persona template. This helps focus my clients on having the conversation about users, not themselves. e.g. \"a \\[something\\] user will need\/want...\" rather than \"we\/I want to build...\"\n\nI tend to break down into the following:\n\n**Motivations**\n\nWhat is it that gets people to do things? e.g. competitiveness, community, hunger, socialising, etc.\n\n**Needs and Wants**\n\nWhat is it that people are trying to obtain? e.g. to lose weight, to go on holiday, to get a promotion, etc.\n\n**Pain Points**\n\nWhat barriers are people experiencing? e.g. it takes too long to..., it's too expensive to..., I can't find..., etc.\n\n**Activities**\n\nWhere are they and what are they doing? e.g. Notion, Slack, networking events, meetups, sports centres, etc.\n\n# 2) There is nothing wrong with speculation\n\nI work with my clients in filling out the template above, and immediately I start to fish out the assumptions from certainty. But, building a speculative persona with what is known today can help focus the approach to discovery (and later marketing). \n\nFor example, I am working with a client to build a food events app to connect chefs with foodies. We can be confident that a chef needs to get exposure to people for their events because they want their business to succeed. But less so on the why, so speculate that their marketing skills are not up to scratch.\n\n# 3) The truth is out there\n\nThe task after this, and to be continuous development, is to find out how true my persona is. That is, I could out with this information and know what people will say. I do this by asking questions about the persona. \n\nIf a pain point is \"I don't have enough time to meal plan\", my first question is \"do you meal plan at all\" and then if no, why not? I can link that information back to the persona, and it tells me if time is the main factor.\n\nIf my persona speculates they want to lose weight, I can ask about personal goals. In weight loss, I might find that people are doing it to be more attractive and therefore tells you vanity is a motivation.\n\nTo find people to ask these questions, take a look at your activities. If you have \"Tech Events\", go to them and ask. If it is online, then reach out via DMs and also be a part of that community.\n\nSidenote: I have a rule of NEVER talking about the product in a user interview.\n\nIn the beginning, I look for 10-20 people to talk to in order to get that first piece of work out of the door.\n\n# 4) Scope\n\nI can now assemble a Product Requirements Document with some real-world insights from here. Very briefly, why are we building this? Who is this for? What problem are we trying to solve? And, what is our Hypothesis on a solution? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope insight from my client's work helps.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677852611.0},{"title":"What type of lawyer for leaving a startup?","author":"Timely_Ad6439","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/startups\/comments\/11h2kqf\/what_type_of_lawyer_for_leaving_a_startup\/","text":"I was brought on as a cofounder in a startup.

I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and the fruits of my labor finally paying off (I mean that in a non-monetary way).  Money isn't my driving force with this project, the product itself is.  This project is valuable in my own life for organization, productivity, and reflection - so I know it could greatly benefit others.\n\n**The project \/ product**\n\nI don't mind sharing the details of the project because it's simple in concept but difficult\/complex in implementation.  I had the idea ~10 years ago, finally starting building out the concept ~5 years ago, had the idea that others might find this useful ~2 years ago, and started building out a new project (a complete rewrite) last year to allow for multiple users to use it.\n\nI'm an avid (analog) journaler.  Again, organization, productivity, and reflection.  You can learn a lot about yourself and personal growth by revisiting years' worth of your own logging - you get out of it what you put into it.  I log everything from spontaneous to-do lists, various things from my job, daily journaling\/reflection, notes from articles \/ books, anything worth writing down - whether meaningful or trivial, etc...  If you're familiar with the bullet journal, it's similar to that with my own flare.  To the naked eye it looks like chaos, but it's very well organized.  I use symbols to differentiate between different entries and an index in the front of the journal to keep track of the pages those symbols appear - it takes less than 5 minutes at the end of everyday to add the page numbers for each type of entry in the index.  It's a type of reflection at the end of the day.  Now I can go to previous years' journals and view specific entries by looking in the index for all the pages those entries might appear (my weight, the cost of gas, daily reflection entries, what I did for work that day, etc...).\n\nThe only con or downfall to this method, and the reason I started a create a digital version of it, is you can't easily \"search\" for entries by keyword or visual progress if the types of entries are numeric, dates, or some form of stat.  For instance, I want to be able to graph my weight, or the price of gas at the time of purchase, or any other type of entry that can indicate status or progress.  Plus, what if I want to add photos I took during the day with my phone to an entry?  Obviously, you can't do that with a physical journal.\n\nSo I set out to create an app that can do all of this.  I believe this app will benefit anybody who uses it, regardless of background or profession with the ability to customize it to their own needs.  \n\nIt may sound somewhat complex, but it's pretty simple.  You create the type of entry you want to make in the beginning and record your information with that entry.  Examples would include a daily journal entry (title, date, free form text field, and possibly image uploads), a daily weight entry (date, numeric weight input), etc...  It goes a couple steps further with the ability to tag individual entires and organize them into a collection no matter the type of entries.  If you're an author writing a book, you might have entry types for ideas, citations, website bookmarks, actual chapters, etc... all fall under one type of collection you can easily view.\n\n**1.  Should I make my project open source?**\n\nI owe a lot of my knowledge to open sourced projects in general.  I've even contributed to many over the years, whether fixes or feature additions - I think there's a real benefit in community feedback.  \n\nThis project itself is split in two.  There's backend \/ API and a frontend.  The idea here is to have an agnostic frontend whether it's a mobile app, website, or dedicated desktop client that communicates to the backend.\n\nAs for the money aspect, I don't see a real problem in users serving the project on their own (I guess I could license it for non-commercial\/personal use only).  These are the types of users that probably wouldn't pay anyway or have privacy in mind.  As far as privacy, it's setup to have encrypted values in the DB if you want specific entries to be encrypted.  But if entries aren't important enough to be encrypted, you don't have to.  The only downfall is that encrypted values can't be searched against - but that's where tagging comes in to play because you can search against tags.\n\nMost users won't care about running\/maintaining it themselves, so they'd be more than happy to pay.\n\nOne idea I had was to release it as open source when I hit some sort of monetary milestone from paying users (say $100k or $1M in sales), OR if enough money has been donated for it to be released as such.  Seems a little weird, but not a bad idea I suppose.\n\nOr, just release it as open sourced in general to get as many technical eyes on it in general.\n\n**2.  Payment \/ business model**\n\nI think the main use\/functions should be free.  I'm not sure it would do well unless I had many users actually using and depending on it for daily use.  The paid part would come from extra features that users might need like charts\/graphs to visualize their entries, specific notifications they can create\/setup, additional space for images\/files, etc...  There would be no shortage of features that could be tacked on.  Either pay per feature, or one set cost for all I suppose.\n\n**3.  Future of features**\n\nI can easily think of many features that could be added over time.  I honestly don't think there would be a shortage of features.  But for now, the simplicity of what's described above would be the inital release.  There's more that I haven't mentioned, but not required to get the concept across.\n\n**4.  Timeline**\n\nIn reading through other posts, I get the sense that this community is all about getting the product out there in front of as many eyes as quick as possible.  I'm really not that much in a hurry, but I have started dedicating more time toward this project.  Again, the backend \/ API is mostly done - only features over time will be added - and has around 1k tests written for it.

The product I've been building already exists in this space, but was built over 5 years ago and is actively used within the community. Based on traffic and community insights I'd estimate it has \\~1m users and 15k DAU. However, if you ask anyone who uses it, they all hate it. People have attempted to dethrone it before, but the execution is always awful and basically just reskins the popular tool or tries to turn it into a social media app, noone has actually tried to fix the issues people have with the popular tool.\n\nBefore development, in evenings after work I pored over the subreddits, facebook groups and forums looking for any complaints about this tool, I looked at the github pull requests and issues, and compiled a massive list and ranked the wants\/needs. I then started building. I launched the MVP on Wednesday and ran a few small reddit ads just to get a little bit of traffic and get some initial feedback and it's actually blown up. Off of $30 of free reddit ads that resulted in just 30 clicks, I've had 500 site visits and closing in on 100 sign ups and the feedback has been amazing.\n\nI have a contact page, and through that contact page I received a message from a prominent YouTuber in the space, with \\~100k subscribers and is considered one of the experts in the space saying he loves the site and has been wanting to build something similar and asked if I'd like to partner and work together.\n\nI had actually planned to reach out to him once the site was less MVP-esque to sponsor a video or two, but I guess he got to me first. But now I'm unsure how to navigate this. It could be huge for me and the tool, but at the same time, its so early I wouldnt know how to structure a partnership like this. I don't want to start divvying up equity already. I'm not even sure what questions I have, its just happening so quickly. I guess I'd like just some general advice.\n\nHas anyone gone through anything similar or have any advice on how to navigate this?

I still want to work on it and help out whenever I can, but realistically, I can\u2019t commit as a full-time founder because I\u2019ll now be committing 40 hours a week to another job. That being said, I want to be fair to the startup and give up some of my equity\u2026 but I also want to be fair to myself and don\u2019t want to just gift it away for free \u2013 I only got paid probably a grand total of $23k (before taxes) for all of this.\n\nMy cofounder and I started out as an even split of 50\/50, but after some small investments, a few advisors, and another cofounder (who is at 10% equity and only commits about 10 hours a month, which they haven\u2019t actually hit that yet, it\u2019s more like 1-2 hours a month for the time being - they also only joined 2 months ago), I\u2019m at about 40% of common stock (about 37% fully diluted). What I was thinking of was keeping 10% (and staying on as an advisor\/part-time cofounder, much like the other one) and then selling back the remainder. I hate that I feel guilty about it, but at the same time, wasn\u2019t that my payment? I\u2019m still going to be involved with the company, just not as much, so it wouldn't be \"dead equity\" or anything. Part of me wonders if I should actually keep more than just 10% (especially since I was there from the start and it wouldn't be where it was today without me), but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just being greedy at this point. At the same time, my set up would be similar to the cofounder that just hopped on and (if I'm being honest) serves more as an advisor right now than anything.\n\nAnyway, what I\u2019m wondering is: do any of you have experience with this? And do you know how I could do this? I searched this sub a bit and found a few mentions of creating scenarios where you essentially loan out your shares (that the company then buys once they raise x funds, etc), but I\u2019m still not fully clear on how this would play out or how investors would feel about it. I'm not even sure how you would price the share price either. Because again, I don\u2019t want to screw the company, but I also don\u2019t want to screw myself.\n\nAny insight or advice would be appreciated.

We officially launched at the end of last year and since then we have acquired 150+ paying clients. Moreover, this number could quickly increase 10x-20x if we had certain financial resources. We have an overwhelming demand for our software that we cannot fulfill due to a variety of reasons, mainly the lack of funds for development (including expanding the programming team) as well as hiring staff to handle various tasks such as customer support, onboarding, sales, and more.\n\nThe five of us are the founders, two of whom are technical experts (lead devs), one is an expert in a field with over 15 years of experience, one is an expert in marketing and sales in a field with over 20 years of experience, and one is a project manager who has already been involved in the development of similar software solutions in the past (the solution is complex and we needed people with concrete field development experience). Currently, we have two developers on board and we are in the process of onboarding the third. We have funded all the previous business expenses (which were not small) out of our own pockets, by each of us doing several jobs.\n\nI think it is safe to say that we have an experienced team that covers a good portion of the necessary elements for such a startup to succeed. It has been obvious for some time that the demand for quality software in the domestic market is so great that our chance of failure is extremely low - there are several competing software solutions, but all their clients are very dissatisfied with their current solutions. The market we compete in is very large, and we offer packages for almost every domestic company. We are in contact with a large number of people who are interested in partnership\/distribution, and we have solid sales networks developed.\n\nHowever, there are other problems that are hindering our growth and causing us to frequently turn down clients, mostly related to finances. There is increasing pressure on our team, as the current revenue is just enough to pay for basic expenses and break even. We cannot fully focus on further development because we still have to work on more than one job. We cannot afford to pay for many things we need. It is possible to continue with slow growth, but all members of the team are feeling increasing pressure. Considering everything, we have concluded that we could consider the option of raising investment to accelerate growth and reduce pressure on the core team. While we can continue with slow growth, we have all agreed that seeking investment is an option worth considering.\n\nTaking into account the very complete and expert team we have, the big and quality technology we have developed so far, market validation and market size, our software quality compared to the competitor's, and the growth we are achieving, we believe we are great fit for investment. Only problem is our location, as we are located in developing country.\n\nHow likely are we to get the investment from outside of our country? How should we proceed in order to achieve that? Is there any investment firms interested in investing in developing countries?\n\nNote that there isn't right investment opportunities for us in our country, as most investments are very small pre-seed investments of around $50k or less and that won't do the job for us. We would be interested in investment of $200-500k.\n\n  Does anyone have experience with this subject and would be willing to  share it? I'm also interested in hearing about the general experiences  of others who have been in similar situations. \n\nThank you in advance!","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1677216591.0},{"title":"How do you know your idea is good ?","author":"CommercialAd914","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/startups\/comments\/11aeqj5\/how_do_you_know_your_idea_is_good\/","text":"This is 2 questions in 1 post: \n\n1.

So I'm interested in revisiting this project, after my years of experience now I think I can do a better job with the product, and most importantly the revenue model. \n\nHere is the graph for the metrics: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3owxMOj.png\n\nYou notice the graph is obviously trending downward, but I'm curious if this display product-market fit after 2.5 year product history. \n\nAdditionally, you will notice the \"New Users\" section, has some big spikes in the beginning and then slowly fades away. This is largely due to doing a lot of marketing in the beginning and then letting word of mouth do the rest. \n\nAfter looking at this graph, I'm wondering if anyone has thoughts on revisiting this project. It reached about 100k users, assuming a 5% conversion rate at $5\/mo could generate $25k\/mo... \n\nI think I can execute on this better than I could in 2015 though.

I went from being a Product Manager in a prominent startup to working for myself. My clients are also all startups, often small teams with a good vision.\n\nWhen working on a new endeavour, user interviews are minimal, and there are zero insights as there are no users on the platform yet. This leads to teams who have scheduled builds for 6-12 months, with anxiety about release and less commitment towards certain features.\n\nBut one successful way to get insight without stopping the development flow is by using prototypes. Remove all the context behind the build, boil it down to the core problem being solved, and state the most fundamental questions being asked. With that, build a small product, separate from the brand and take that to people. With this, you can feed insights into the main development, and decisions can be made confidently.\n\nOne client has a product for self-development. They wanted to look at how to help people make better, more productive to-do lists. 5 features were discussed, and all were on speculation. I said the magic 3 letters, MVP, many times but that does not click with everybody. So I defined it as a single purpose - to find out if people are writing non-productive to-do lists because they fail to connect bigger long-term objectives with the tasks they set themselves. \n\nSo I built a web page with a separate name that is a simple flow leading the user from defining their future self to an action they can take today. I put it in front of people and asked them about their experiences. What I learnt from this exercise completely changed the tone of the conversation within the wider team, and now we are scheduling features everyone feels confident in.\n\nI offer this as a service and call it the **Live Rapid Prototype.** There are 3 rules:\n\n1. The Prototype has a singular purpose of gathering insight.\n2. The Prototype will have a value proposition that is delivered in person.\n3. Once the insight is gathered, the Prototype is deleted.\n\nI am sharing this as I read a lot of posts here about being in that early stage of not having anything to work off of.

This is the standard advice when budding entrepreneurs  are in the  idea phase and can't decide which path they should go on. I'm here to  say that this is incorrect.\n\nNow,  is finding a problem first a huge improvement to starting with an idea?  Obviously, but there's problems to be solved everywhere, in any industry  or facet of life that you inspect, a problem will inevitably appear.   Newspaper industry? Lots of problems you can find. Electronic dance  festival enthusiasts community? Again, there's many potential problems  you can solve for this group.

What does right mean? Is it growing fast? Is it in the  earlier stages of being an established industry with lots of room to  grow? Does it have clear, logical reasons as to justify it's longevity?\n\nWhen  you pick the correct market you're essentially just choosing how much  privilege and advantage you get to start out with and I think there's  too many people overlooking this in exchange for any problem they are  able to solve in good way. Yes that's important, but the reality is that  if you solve a problem with a 1\/10 product or solution in the correct  market you can still have 10\/10 success at least for a certain point  until you straighten things out, on the other hand,  if you solve a  problem with a 10\/10 product in a 1\/10 market, no matter what you really  do, you're just not going to make money.\n\nYou  can start the race on foot with a broken leg and no directions, or you  can start in a ferrari with  google maps and and heated seats.\n\nEverywhere  you go the first thing you hear is to look for a problem, but please  put yourself in the ferrari and handpick a good market, then explore  that market, look for issues and things can be improved and then start  working on it.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1676611138.0},{"title":"Solo founder in high school w\/ turbulent family","author":"throwaway19383852804","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/startups\/comments\/114cjry\/solo_founder_in_high_school_w_turbulent_family\/","text":"Title says it all, also I\u2019ve only got school buddies, not friends you can really talk to outside of that.

Some of other engineers don't really believe in my vision or the product,\u00a0 they hinted at that last year but late last year one of the engineers left, and in discussions it is obvious that the engineer that left and at least one of the two that hasn't left yet don't believe in the product. \n\nThe product is very technically challenging (and is in the AI space), and will definitely not be fully featured this year.\n\nI left a good job to do this and obviously believe in this.

I am a technical startup founder with limited business knowledge.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI am one of four founders of a software development startup. We are all in our early 20s and began a few months ago with minimal investment from our pockets. We currently operate fully remotely using our own equipment. Three of us have technical expertise or are developers, and one is a management specialist. However, in a small team, we all oversee several things. We each have a 25% share in the company.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\nCurrently, we are in the MVP stage of our product. We have hired two employees to help with the development process. To sustain and generate running money, we also work for a few close clients to help with their software needs.\n\nFinancially, we are not in a great state as our investment has already been exhausted, and we are in a loop. We work on a client project, we receive payment, we pay our employees, and there is nothing left. None of the founders take a salary from the company. Essentially, we have zero income as founders at this point. Financially, we sometimes question whether the decision to hire early was the right one, but from a technical standpoint, hiring has been beneficial. We have divided our time to work on our own product and client projects. We are not yet concerned about our financial situation, as we plan to run as it is for a few more months (until we official launch our product) before taking any strong action.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nThere is no problem; in fact, there is a possible opportunity for growth. But I have many questions.\n\nA few days ago, one of our clients proposed getting involved with us. He is willing to be a part of our team in any way we want him to be involved. We are very confused about how to bring him in, as we think it could be beneficial to us. He already has a running business, has over a decade of experience, a good network, and more.\n\nThe most common approach is giving him a certain equity and bringing him in. However, I have self-doubt about this. I think our current company evaluation will not be a significant number as we still do not have a market-ready product, no money in our bank, and only our skills. **How do we calculate a proper company valuation in this situation?** What we want is for him to pay a significant amount of money to help improve our situation and work on our product. He has made it clear that he doesn't want to stay as a client and doesn't want to be an investor. Understanding his intentions, he wants to be our direct partner but in what other ways than equity?\n\nWhat we want is to not lose our independence and decision power in the company. We want to find a way to bring him, his investments, and his expertise without him directly interfering with us.\n\nBeing a technical founder, I lack much business knowledge, and it would be helpful if you could provide some insights. Also, I open heartedly welcome any other feedback regarding anything.  \n\n\n**EDIT: I MISSED SOMETHING**\n\nActually, I missed an important point. The main reason he wants to get involved with us is that he has plans to create different mobile and web apps and expand his business country wide. He has very futuristic and large-scale plans. Therefore, he wants a group of people with software expertise with him all the time.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1676393800.0},{"title":"Reaching out to tech company\u2019s ceo that i got recomended.","author":"Forward-Sir-821","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/startups\/comments\/112gxrh\/reaching_out_to_tech_companys_ceo_that_i_got\/","text":"I am 21 yr old I am very creative (almost in an autistic way) I was accepted to a business group in our country 3 months ago where a met a lot of people with the same mindset.

This has long been a helpful forum for me so I wanted to reach out to ask for some advice.\n\nMy background is actually as a PhD nanotechnologist\/neuroscientist. My training was in fundamental physics, chemistry and I self taught myself biology and molecular biology during my PhD. I've also self taught myself some basic scripting techniques in python, disassembled phones as a hobby, built computers from a young age and really been immersed in tech. Very much a tech geek but I never really loved coding and haven't done much aside from find basic HTML, PHP, bash terminal\/Linux usage, SQL and python.... But really... Only dabbled if I'm honest here guys. \n\nYou could say more accurately that I'm a materials scientist with strengths in biotechnology. I am currently CTO of a medtech startup developing a diagnostic Biosensor for use in the healthcare setting. Class III medical device for use in a hospital setting..\n\nFounded in 2017, today we have 33 staff. Teams of chemists, Biomedical engineers, electronics engineers, data scientists, software engineers manufacturing and microfabrication engineers and more.We are VC funded and have raised close to $7.7M in investment to date and won 1.5x in state and federal grant programs.\n\nMy role used to be somewhat of a combination between a CSO and a CTO. We have recently brought on a CSO who specialises in the exact type of sensors we are developing. As a founder you do anything and everything. My portfolio within the company primarily comprises the tech teams today.\n\nI lead all: product, hardware, electronics, software and data science teams, as well as writing our patents and developing\/growing intellectual property within the company. Currently 9 direct reports but growing out to 10 soon with the hire of a new technical lead\/senior software engineer .\n\nDirectly reporting to me I have: 3 data scientists, a senior data scientist, a junior software engineer, 3 hardware\/electronics engineers.\n\nI've learned a lot inorganically through directly learning from my own staff over the years. But I'm really keen to see if I can take my learning to the next level. \n\nI'm not particularly strong with coding, but I understand enough of the concepts to be able to speak with my team to understand how they are implementing things and building out out infrastructure (think cloud, DevOps, CI\/CD processes etc) however I really want to take it to the next level : Especially as our CSO (analytical chemist by training) and CEO (an MD)  are not particularly Tech literate . I'm the most tech literate person in the company and I recognise that it is an area I can improve upon.. We don't have the resources to hire a CTO at present.\n\nI never studied computer science, software engineering or data science but I've had a lot of inorganic exposure over the years: but I'm lacking some fundamentals here. I'm not sure if it's a good use of time for me to learn how to code given I won't be doing much of that anyway, but as a CTO I do need to be able to help the teams, by understanding and anticipating their needs, keeping them accountable, setting priorities and leading technology decision making.\n\nI'm wondering if anybody has any suggestions or tips for training or courses I could undertake as part of my individual development plan to upskill me as a CTO..\n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676294631.0},{"title":"Validating a product - should I ask for CC details?","author":"DelPrive235","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/startups\/comments\/111dad0\/validating_a_product_should_i_ask_for_cc_details\/","text":"I\u2019ve created a landing page with UI video for a productivity app I want to validate.

It\u2019s my friend and I split at 50\/50 with shared duties. We started in 2020 developing our prototype. In 2021 we got a job to help fund some initial costs and I found us investor that in 2022 gave us capital for 9 months. That got us from March until December. \u00a0near the end of the term we updated our terms going into this year 2023. Our investor has always been a distant one and never had any issues at first. Recently since October he\u2019s been hard to get in contact with but would always seem to pull through. In December he\u2019s gotten slammed with divorce court.\u00a0\n\nOur investor pledged a certain amount to us with monthly allocated expenses and a dedicated budget. As time went on we started to enact financial conservatism to just have more capital to our availability. Natural. Since then, we were in a big R&D phase that prolonged due to our freelancer having two kids and setting up two production chains for our prototype alongside with delays from shipping due to distance and components taking time due to shortage and shipment. Through all of this though, we still only ended up spending the allocated amount no more. This process was also necessary because we found a huge major design flaw that if we had gone through with our original plan of final production, we would\u2019ve blown a lot of money. Since 2023 he has basically been absent and has enacted a financial conservatism that is costing us valuable time.\u00a0\n\n\\-The first month of January was spent just trying to negotiate a $3000 reduction on a project from an engineer we don\u2019t plan on hiring for this project. \u00a0he has reduced our pay to $500 monthly sometimes even less \u00a0working 8 hours a day for 6 days which doesn\u2019t cover my friends and I expenses and to mitigate that said investor has hired us to work for him on a project which doesn\u2019t allow us to have a part time job. We don\u2019t compensate ourselves the amount needed nor is it consistent. Payroll is all over the place he fails to execute when needed. Capital isn\u2019t in our account available to us to pay for services or components when needed often delaying us precious time. We have a really aggressive and very possible roadmap for 2023 and we can\u2019t waste time due to potential homelessness in 2024 cause of our situations. In a phone call this Monday I mentioned to investor that Friday we had to move through with production because the new freelancer says he has to accommodate their other projects and we would lose our spot and would have to wait a month for them to make space for us. This was a project that was supposed To be started before the holidays but they have kept delayed themselves because they love our project.\u00a0Investor said the money would be in the account and we would be compensated because we havent been paid in a month and are in crippling debt. We wanted to get jobs going into January but investor said to hold off because of a project he wants us to work on for him which we have been putting in the time since but havent received compensation.--Now i say we but my cofounder swears on giving him time and that he would pull through if we just wait a few days cause thats how he is out of the blue he saves the day. And as to not sour our relationship and go behind his back. I've been saying we need to find a new investor to allocate capital into the account so that we can 1. go through with the project or 2. if that amount will stake away too much of the corp, then just enough to feed ourselves for 3-5 months since we are literally starving, i have been underweight for a few months now because of this, an reliant on others around us. We do have the time to get a second job but we find ourselves working better and getting a lot done working full time since theres a lot of testing to be done on the electronic and software side due to the nature of what we work on. lots of r&d have to be pumped. we are also married and required by our families and often find orselves burning out when we pick up a second job hurting our productivity. even then all we require is consistency as to not have to delay bills and rack up debt with interest only making the situation worse. and in a crucial time where lots have to be done it seems counterintuitive because weve been kept busy consistently since starting and havent had down time.  Were heavily working on marketing and trying to gather more feedback and knocking on doors alongside with daily r&d and study time.\n\nProblem--- We've switched our entire focus on working on our investors project in hope that we will get paid. We essentially got a job working for him but no compensation in sight and we lost our spot with the engineer. Cofounder wants to stick waiting and just do as were told and he will eventually reach out and the ball with get moving and all will be good. But he we will eventually need more capital and time is going to be wasted waiting for investor to refill our account since its only monthly amounts being allocated to the account.\n\nSolution--- I think we should bring on board a new investor because it seems a little obvious our investor might be tight on cash or whatever and is ghosting us. However the money will be spent will be decided in our conversation but i dont want to wait anymore. it angers me so much seeing all our potential be wasted. but cofounder doesnt want to sour the relationship. im depressed and burnout and my friend agrees that our company seems like its not even real anymore. i cry everyday and am underweight. Im hard on myself and understand these excuses and can just get a job but with no investor to prospect to it seems like im just going to be stuck working for that next check because ive racked up huge amounts of debt just trying to get by the past few months since there is a constant a mount of work to be done and we have an ultra agressive roadmap for this year because we honestly cant spend another year working due to me losing my house. and bills are expensive and just everyday living in the city.\n\nsorry for the long rantish its late and im just dead inside\n\nTLDR;\n\nInvestor constantly ghost and doesnt have a constatnt capital amount to pay for services and components.no compensation.\n\nShould we get a new Investor???","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1676104876.0},{"title":"What is the best path for me to take as a college student to launch a startup at some point?","author":"EBJLEnjoyer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/startups\/comments\/10z1ekl\/what_is_the_best_path_for_me_to_take_as_a_college\/","text":"Hey folks.\n\nI know I'm very much out of my league here(Some of you all are literal millionaires)  but I really do want to invest my time and energy into the startup world.

Imagine moving from your dinky 4-burner stovetop and tiny oven to a badass commercial space\u2026holy shit batman.  So cool.\n\nWe eliminated free pickup and same day delivery (people were paying $20-60) and moved to shipping only.

We are baking in \u201cfree shipping\u201d to anyone within the 2-day radius.\n\nWe are also offering 2-day-express to anyone outside the 2-day ground range who wants to pay for it.  We already found people willing to pay $70-100 extra for this.\n\nThe 2-day free shipping market is about 6-7x the size of our current market, and if you include 2-day-express market, is about 40x.\n\nWe have an ultra-premium pre-cooked product but are also offering more budget-friendly options where people get the dry ingredients\/seasonings pre-packaged and they cook themselves.

Send free gift boxes to influencers in our 2-day shipping range (just ask them to pay shipping) and have them post & tag us on social media. $3,000\n2. Hire a social media manager to post and engage. Most of our traffic is from social but we do very little. $3,000\n3. Hire expert to build out email marketing (nurture sequences, abandoned cart, etc) $1,000\n4. We get people saying they found us through Google, so hire an SEO expert to review our site $1,000\n5. Boosting Instagram posts, Pinterest posts, and automated LinkedIn connections to influencers. $2,000\n\nTotal $10k\n\nAlso starting in a commercial kitchen and will need to invest in equipment, bulk purchases of ingredients, and kitchen payroll.

I have a friend and coworker (he's been here almost two years) who has recently been having severe health issues (struggling to walk), asked for accommodations, and was denied (something about \"startup culture\"). I saw no evidence of performance issues prior to his illness. They gave him around a month of paid sick time, and then asked him if he was ready to work again. He is really not an assertive guy or knowledgeable on the law, and ended up caving into the pressure to quit - so he can't even collect unemployment. He is losing health insurance in a month (needless to say, he really needs healthcare), and is on H1B, so will likely have to leave the country - leaving his main source of support, his girlfriend and friends. He's in a dire situation on countless levels.\n\nI don't think we meet the FMLA standard - we have more than 50 employees but are half remote.\n\nNeedless to say, this situation outrages me and I'm on the verge of quitting myself. They repeatedly described us a \"family\" but then happily kicked our friend and colleague to the curb when he is at his lowest point in life, ever. I'm planning to bring this up with my manager. In my mind, I don't understand why cutting his pay to the minimum H1B salary while maintaining health benefits is not feasible. Or maybe unpaid leave of absence is compatible with H1B. Can someone provide a possible defense of this company's behavior? Or is it simply unconscionable, as I suspect?\n\nEdit: this seems like a violation of the CRFA (this is in CA). He was denied unpaid medical leave despite meeting all conditions of the CRFA.\n\nFurther edit: after investigating more, seems like a complex situation and I'm not sure they did anything strictly illegal.

And the lessons I learned about\n\n* talking with future customers\n* the power of building customer empathy\n* and how early research continues to pay dividends\n\n## The Backstory\n\nLike every other new idea in the digital age, this one started with an idea and immediately buying a domain.\n\nInstead of heading straight into building my new web app idea, for once, I started off a bit differently.\n\nBefore I wrote a single line of code, I did the following\n\n1. Stood up a basic email capture web page\n2. Gave it a compelling hero statement\n3. Added an email capture form\n4. Then set forth searching for people talking about this problem\n5. I kept refining #2 and kept doing more of #4 as I started to write code\n\nSteps 1-3 seem pretty standard to many.\n\nBut a surprising number of people go straight to building and give 2 and 4 lip service.\n\n## Reason 1 - Never skip talking with your future customers\n\nToday's SaaS markets are crowded. Very rarely are new markets built. Generally, new markets are just a previous market, but with some new tech or approach added.\n\n(We're seeing that right now with AI.)\n\nSo how do you stand out in a crowded market?\n\nBy out-knowing your competition when it comes to your target customers and their problems.\n\nBut you can't out-know your competition if you're not talking to people. And no one will come to you when you don't have a product built yet. So you'll have to go to them.\n\n(And once you build it, no one will likely know you exist, so you'll still have to go to them).\n\nThat's precisely what I did. I searched for keywords related to my future customers and their problems anywhere I knew they were talking.\n\nPlaces like Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, Slack Communities, Forums, etc.\n\nI'd find questions or topics related to what I hoped to solve, and then I'd share my insights into their problems. I never overtly pitched my idea (often not mentioning it at all). I'd just share solutions.\n\nPeople care more about themselves, so put them first. Often the only way they'd know I was up to something was by looking at my profile. And that's okay.\n\n## Reason 2 - Building empathy enables you to speak to your customers with power\n\nAs I talked to people, I began to see common themes in what they were asking and how they put it. I started cataloging this information and used it in my product design.\n\nBut more importantly, at this stage, I kept tweaking the hero statement on my simple landing page.\n\nI went through multiple iterations and then added two important paragraphs below it using this format:\n\n**Before \\[product name\\]:**\u00a0Two or three short and concise sentences. Which describe your ideal customers' pains. Using the words they use when talking about them.\n\n**After \\[product name\\]:**\u00a0Two or three sentences describing their future state. Not speaking to how the above problems are solved, but instead on how they wil feel when they're solved.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 This format (which I artistically-stole \ud83d\ude01) dramatically changed signup conversion.\n\nHere's why.\n\n1. It demonstrates empathy\n2. It demonstrates you understand their problems\n3. And it connects emotionally\n\nThat's a powerful combination.\n\n## Reason 3 - 400+ people would never have converted if I hadn't gone to where they were\n\nSo how did 400+ people come to my landing page and sign up for my wait list?\n\nAll through those replies. Every single one of them.\n\nI never posted a single piece of content of my own. No blog posts, no guest writing, nothing but sharing my own answers and ideas to people's questions.\n\nWhat's incredible about this technique is the long tail of the life of those replies.\n\n90% of those who signed up did so many months after the initial replies. It's surprising how much longer content will continue to drive clicks.\n\n## One last piece of the backstory and one final reason\n\nYou may have noticed I said, \"without knowing.\"\n\nHere's the funny ending to this story. For various reasons, I had to put aside this project for a year. So I only realized a year later that content continued to perform well, and hundreds were signing up for the waitlist.\n\n**But! Here's the final reason.**\n\nWhen you're just starting, it can seem like the things you do are not producing results.\n\nHang in there!\n\n**You may not realize it, but with each post you make and each reply you write, those are small deposits for your future that will pay huge dividends as you keep making them.**\n\n\\[some numbers for benchmarking - the first couple weeks didn't get many signups, just a couple a week. Within 90 days I was around 100. The remaining 303 came in over the next 9 months while I didn't engage with anyone. It was just the previous 3 months still providing results.\\]","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1675905440.0},{"title":"Must have TLDs to Protect Brand?","author":"Snipercide","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/startups\/comments\/10xxb49\/must_have_tlds_to_protect_brand\/","text":"This specifically relates to a tech start-up that owns SaaS software and operates an e-commerce store, that is about to release a new project that will drive a lot of interest towards the brand.\n\nI managed to get the **.com** at the beginning for a premium.

Additionally, not really necessary for FB users to actually meet to complete a transaction such as buying\/selling made the idea of geolocation not as important. \n\nSo, other than releasing it in a specific location\/community and waiting for brand recognition to assist, what do you think is a good way to avoid this issue as best as possible?","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1675726981.0},{"title":"PSA for founders and businesses building new products -- please build less","author":"blizkreeg","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/startups\/comments\/10uyukc\/psa_for_founders_and_businesses_building_new\/","text":"In my client work, the biggest mistake I see startups make is building more.

It\u2019s not as sexy and trendy as platforms like Facebook and Tiktok and people are always chasing the latest fad.\n\nEmail marketing should be making up 20% of your monthly revenue at a minimum, and many brands should be aiming to get this number above 30%. This is particularly true for brands in the eCommerce space, I understand that in certain industries it\u2019s just not possible to generate a massive amount of revenue from emails.\n\nEmail marketing can be broken down into 3 core pillars:\n\n1. Lead Capture\n2. Automated Flows\n3. Manual Campaigns\n\nIf you can optimise these 3 pillars I guarantee that you\u2019ll see a massive increase in your email marketing revenue.\n\nNow, before you even worry about these 3 things you first need to ensure you have the basics covered:\n\n1. You actually have a constant flow of web traffic, you can\u2019t capture emails if no one is visiting your site\n2. You\u2019re always cleaning your list. If your bounce rate gets too high or you\u2019re sending to users that are sending your email to junk or spam, you\u2019re going to ruin your deliverability and that\u2019s not easy to come back from\n3. You\u2019re segmenting your list and ensuring that you\u2019re sending the right emails to the right people. Someone who hasn\u2019t interacted with your brand in 60 days shouldn\u2019t be receiving the same email as someone who purchased a product yesterday\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got the basics covered, then you can get to optimising your email strategy.\n\n**1.** **Lead capture form**\n\nYour email marketing strategy falls apart without a well-optimised lead capture form. Lead capture forms are the forms and pop-ups you see on websites asking for your email, generally in exchange for some form of value.\n\nI know a lot of people are not a fan of pop-ups and think that they\u2019re spammy and irritating. To be frank, it doesn\u2019t matter what you think, they work. These forms can have a conversion rate anywhere from 1% to 15%. Think about it, if you have 1000 people visit your store, that\u2019s 10 to 150 potential customers that have given you their email and shown an interest in your brand\/purchase intent.\n\nAs mentioned above, I know that some people hate the idea of lead capture forms. I agree that if not done properly they\u2019re just super spammy and have a negative impact. There are two ways that you can mitigate this outcome\n\n1. Ensure that you have the right triggers set up for your form. It shouldn\u2019t pop up as soon as a user lands on your page. Generally, the best parameters are:\n\n* User has spent 8s on-site or scrolled 60%\n* And is showing exit intent\n\nBy setting up these two parameters you\u2019re ensuring that your pop-up isn\u2019t overly aggressive and only appears when the user has had the chance to become accustomed to your brand and pre-qualify themselves.\n\n1. The second way to ensure that your pop-up isn\u2019t too spammy is to offer value in exchange for an email. I see so many pop-ups that appear as soon as I land on a site asking me to give my email to receive newsletters and updates from the brand. Why would I care about the newsletters of a brand I don\u2019t even know and haven\u2019t even been given a chance to learn about?\n\nNow there are some brands that are just so interesting that people will give their email just to be a part of it, these brands are quite rare.\n\nOne of the best ways to offer value is to give a discount code for customers to get a % or $ off their first order. This is a great offer because it not only provides an immediate and tangible benefit for your potential customers, it also prequalifies all those who give their email as they're showing strong purchase intent.\n\nHowever, I know that not all brands are interested in giving away discounts and this is completely understandable. There are 100s of ways that you can provide value to your audience. Just think about the kind of people that are on your site. What do they desire? What troubles them? Figure out a simple solution you can offer for one of their problems.\n\nFor example, a skincare brand can offer a guide to the perfect 5-step skincare routine that guarantees clearer skin within just 7 days.\n\nA clothing brand can offer \u2018The 7 biggest fashion trends of 2023\u2019.\n\nBe creative and provide genuine value.\n\nThey\u2019re the two variables that you need to optimise to create an effective lead capture form. It\u2019s important to always be analysing and optimising these forms to get your conversion rate as high as possible. You can also split-test different offers to find what works best.\n\n**2. Automated Flows**\n\nWhen it comes to actual emails, they can be broken down into two types. Automated flows and manual campaigns. You should aim for 50\/50 revenue to be generated from each.\n\nThe best part of automated flows is that once they\u2019re set up, they\u2019re constantly running in the background and generating revenue on autopilot. Great brands will always be analysing and optimising their flows to improve results. But the truth is, even if you set up \u2018good enough\u2019 flows and leave them to run, you can still generate consistent revenue.\n\nNow there are so many flows that can be set up. Some brands have 10+ running consistently. I suggest starting with the core 4 and building from there. Each flow should have 4 to 8 emails in each. The core 4 are:\n\n* Welcome Series\n* Abandoned Cart\n* Browse Abandonment\n* Customer Thank You\/Post Purchase\n\nJust by implementing these 4 flows, you can add an extra 10% to 20% to your revenue.\n\nI could make a separate detailed post about every flow but I will just briefly summarise each flow to give you a basic understanding.\n\n**Welcome Series**\n\nTrigger: Subscribed to email list\n\nFilter: Placed order and bounced email 0 times since starting flow (important you don\u2019t keep sending to addresses that are bouncing as this will ruin your deliverability).\n\nEmails: 4-8\n\nObjective: Start by providing the piece of value you promised in exchange for the user's email. The first email should be conversion optimised with only the intention to make a sale. As the flow goes on your emails should be rapport, social proof, authority, and highlight the benefits and features of your brand and product.\n\n**Abandoned Cart**\n\nTrigger: Added to cart\n\nFilter: Placed order 0 times since starting flow\n\nEmails: 3-4\n\nObjective: The first email should just be a friendly reminder that the user has not completed checkout. As the flow goes on, incentivise the purchase, build rapport, establish social proof and create urgency.\n\n**Browse Abandonment**\n\nTrigger: Viewed product\n\nFilter: Placed order 0 times since starting flow. Added to cart 0 times since starting flow. Started checkout 0 times since starting flow.\n\nEmails: 1\n\nObjective: Keep this one simple. Include a hot product to incentivise the purchase or show off all your best sellers to assist with making a decision.\n\n**Customer Thank-you**\n\nTrigger: Placed order\n\nFilter: Placed order 0 times since starting flow.\n\nEmails: 4-8\n\nObjective: There are a few objectives with this post-purchase flow. Firstly, to thank the customer for buying. Your first email should be a simple thank you without any bells or whistles. The second objective is to mitigate buyer's remorse by creating excitement around the product and showing off other satisfied customers. The final objective of this flow is to up-sell, down-sell, and cross-sell.\n\nThese are just 4 of many flows you can set up. It doesn\u2019t hurt to have more as long as they\u2019re all high-quality and well-optimised. Here are a few more super-profitable flows:\n\n* Site abandonment\n* Customer win-back flow\n* Abandoned checkout\n* Cross-sell flow\n\n**3. Manual Campaigns**\n\nI don\u2019t want to spend too much time on this one as this post is already a mammoth and manual campaigns are the most common and self-explanatory kinds of emails.\n\nManual campaigns are essentially just emails you manually send to your list. The frequency of which you send these emails will depend on many factors but I suggest starting with 1\/week as a bare minimum anywhere up to 1\/day. Essentially just send more and more until you notice a decline in performance.\n\nNow if you\u2019re sending 1\/day you\u2019re not sending them to the same people every time. This is why it\u2019s important to segment your list so that you\u2019re sending different emails to different people.\n\nNow your manual campaigns should include both promotional emails and value-based emails. Remember, you don\u2019t want to go for a hard sell with every email, you\u2019re trying to establish a relationship with your audience.\n\nHere are a few manual campaigns that work really well:\n\n1. Customer Spotlight\n2. Product of the Month\n3. Back in Stock\n4. Blog Post\n5. Did you know\n6. Message from the founder\n7. UGC\n8. Customer Check-in\n\nThere you have it, the 3 core pillars of email marketing. If you\u2019re not doing any email marketing whatsoever yet you have good traffic on your website then this post should really excite you. I mean, it should really really excite you. Just by setting up these core flows and sending out some manual campaigns you can add anywhere from 10% to 40% to your monthly revenue.\n\nIf you do a little bit of email marketing but not everything in this post, this post should excite you also because you can still drastically increase your revenue just by implementing a few more things.\n\nIf you\u2019re already doing everything in this post, just keep testing and optimising. Ensure that you\u2019re providing as much value at every possible turn and that you have your brand voice\/identity down pat.\n\nIf you\u2019re also an email marketer, leave some more tips\/insights down below!

How easily you can re-list the same listing. Airbnbs, Movies = 100%. \n* $ amount per listing\n* \\# of transactions per listing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you see where I'm going with this? If I'm understanding this correctly, by multiplying all of this together, I'd have the total potential market for the contributor-side of a two-sided market. Feels iffy to me though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we look at Airbnb as an example (I pulled these #s from my ass for the sake of argument):\n\nLet's say they have potentially 70M US-based \"contributors\" (people who could list their property).\n\nThose contributors would keep the listing for 5 yrs on average, and list 1.3 properties, on average over their lifespan. Each listing \"lasts\" 80% of the year, and can be listed repeatedly with no extra work (don't have to create a new listing with new images each time). \n\nFinally they list for an average of $150\/night (for this example) and can have (365 x the 80%) transactions per year. \n\nSo one contributor will list 1.3 properties at $150 per transaction, 292 nights per year, for 5 years for a potential of $56,940 per contributor over their lifespan and they only list the property once. I know I'm skipping carrying costs but I want to get this gross amount first. \n\nIf there are 70M potential contributors in the US, that's 70M \\* 56,940 = $3.99T, no? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?

Since there was no financial risk involved, I jumped on the bandwagon and now we have a profitable company with one employee. \n\nI was completely new to his industry so during our startup I did all the tech-related stuff and he did everything sales. He's that guy who lives on a cloud, has crazy ideas and an ideological view of the world. I'm the practical guy who gets things done and is always looking for the most efficient way to work.\n\nHe has little familiarity with technology and this quickly ensured that in a mostly digitally-run company, a lot of tasks came to me: marketing website, social media posts, developing our platform, drawing out operational flows.... But I can't blame him: technology doesn't interest him much more than sending an email or whatsapp message.\n\nAlong the way, it turns out that I'm a better sales person than him, so over time most sales came to me. I'm also more analytical and anticipatory so accounting, finance and the strategic part also became mostly my part.\n\nWe've been in the situation for six months now where he mainly performs operational tasks that I have fully conceived and developed. He hardly takes any initiative to further develop our company. He is less communicative than I am, which causes me to still not know what he wants to achieve with our company. When I ask him about it, he himself indicates that he is someone who has no definite idea about this and needs someone like me to take the lead. As a friend, I don't have a problem with this, but as a co-partner with 50-50 equity, it's sour that I'm taking the lead in pretty much everything and he's laid-back just doing some administrative work and has some low-effort salestalks.\n\nI have expressed my concern and frustration about this several times and how I feel to get sucked out. I have two young children and a very busy family-life whilst he's still on his own. It would great if he could take some of my tasks away. But even if he tries, they always end up back to me because he lacks (technological) insights to ge things done. \n\nWhen having this chat with him, he always confirms my concerns and recognizes that he falls short in these matters and will grow in this. I notice that I make him insecure and stress him with these kind of conversations, which is not my intention. I just want to know where I am up against. \n\nBut I know by now that I will change little about this guy on the cloud. I am confident in our business and its potential but I realize more and more that he cannot or will not be an essential part of the growth process ahead, if we want to grow.\n\nI have no desire to have this difficult conversation with him again because I know he will once again prove me right, I will make him feel inferior, but the conversation will ultimately change nothing. \n\nI am distraught.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675362345.0},{"title":"UX question \"My recommendation\" or \"Our recommendation\" when bot or web app suggesting stuff","author":"nickolotzo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/startups\/comments\/10ro7p4\/ux_question_my_recommendation_or_our\/","text":"i'm building a funnel and at the end of it surfacing recommendations, this used to be a chat bot so it was using \"I\/me\/my\" a lot, now this funnel is moving to a web app where the user answers some questions then gets recommendations.
