While doing some research on proteins, I came across prions and did some digging. I was incredibly intrigued by prion conditions such as Kuru and vCJD as I've always been fascinated by diseases and things of the sort. Most of the stuff I look up always ends in the happy ending that there is some sort of cure, but not with prions. Forgive me if this is stupid, but is there a possibility for prion-related diseases to be cured in the future? Is there some sort of biological principle that makes this impossible? I think the idea is so fascinating and I hope that one day the terminal condition of having your brain fold like a flip phone on you can be solved.",

I do not have good social skills. I have depression and anxiety. I hope to start taking medication from my depression and anxiety when 18 even though my parents are against it. I have a big butt. \n\nI have grown up in a predominantly white and Asian environment. When I look around, I never see people who look like me. My city is somewhat over 6% black. \n\nI intend to start at community college in spite of the fact that I was once against the idea. I don‚Äôt know what I will major in. I am from a low income family, but really also don‚Äôt want to make a decision that I will end up regretting. \n\nI may be a little below average facially. I don‚Äôt know what I would look like with makeup on. \n\nPeople in middle school seemed to ‚Äúknow‚Äù that I deal w internalized racism. The black girl who shouted I was ugly from the bleachers in ninth grade is someone who I suspect really dislikes me bc of it \n\nMy family members can be sort of toxic. My father seems noticeably off and is also actually quite dumb/unintelligent. My older brother is in rehab and in spite of some odd past behavior, he is actually the family member I now sympathize with the most. My mother was good at caring for me when I was a child, but is not a good parent at this point, and I have realized that both she and my father neglected my older brother. \n\nMy family members are colorists. \n\nI don‚Äôt have a racial preference. However, I will admit that I have not been attracted to an Asian boy since fourth grade when I had a crush on one (he was actually a really nice guy, I just suppose that my tastes changed.)\n\nI fawn over white celebrity men more than black women are stereotypically expected to. \n\nThe strongest level of infatuation that I‚Äôve probably ever had toward someone I‚Äôve met in real life (not just a celebrity) was toward this mixed (1/2 black 1/2 white) boy. He is extroverted, and wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsmart‚Äù (had a 1.5 GPA.) He is light skinned and was known for being nice looking in freshman year (was probably slightly above average.) He initially said I was a 5, and then after maybe 10 seconds of re-assessing my appearance said I was a 4. This was in freshman year, when I had a gap between my teeth.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10ft2hm)",

        "text": "I graduated over 6 years ago with a Bachelor's Degree in Biological Sciences.\n\nSince then, I've done work as a research technician in the arctic for 3 summers, while spending the rest of the time as a part-time field technician for my university's ecology lab. \n\nI eventually got a job as a county inspector, but fast forward nearly 3 and a half years later, and I'm considering a change. While the job has amazing benefits, pensions, etc., it doesn't pay well for the amount of work I do, and honestly, it's taking a toll on me. \n\nLately, and on the recommendation of my fianc√© and former coworkers (who left the position), I'm considering becoming a teacher because the Public School system not only has nearly identical benefits (and better pay believe it or not), but most importantly, it offers \\*better\\* tuition reimbursement for a masters degree. Now I've been thinking about doing a master's degree for a while, and while my job does have tuition reimbursement, there's just no way I can balance both school and this job in particular. \n\nNow I'm not saying being a teacher will be easier, and I'm sure doing a masters at the same time will have its own challenges, but with better tuition reimbursement, more days off (including most of the summer), and the fact that some universities here have financial aid programs \\*just\\* for teachers doing their master's (so I can save up even more money), I think it's a fair trade-off. Plus, as I said, it actually \\*pays\\* more. Luckily, both my parents are teachers, so I more or less know what to expect and my mom even offered to \"train\" me and give me some of her lesson plans (she's an AP Biology teacher) so I can at least have a good start should I decide to do this. She's even thinking about retiring by the end of the year, so theoretically, I can actually end up replacing her at her school. \n\nWith that said, I'm curious to know, has anyone else here gone to education just to go back to school? If so, do you have any recommendations or advice regarding which degree to choose (or which degree is relatively high in demand), how to balance the workload, or if this is even a smart idea to begin with? Originally I was thinking about doing a master's in food sciences (something I was really interested in), but I'm now reconsidering something else since there are not really that many jobs in that field. Bioinformatics seems interesting, but I know very little about coding other than some time using R-Studio.   \n\n\nThanks for the advice.",

Each definition of sex I have been given in university has straight up called biological sex a social construct and that there are no real markers of male and female because chromosomes and phenotypes don't always line up with expectations regarding bio sex. (Yes, this is a sociology course I was forced to take for credits) \n\nWhile there are obviously social constructions that come along with sex, that doesn't mean sex isn't a biological reality...right? I am LGBT myself and this is all highly confusing, it feels more like pandering at an academic level from people who aren't even within the community.

        "text": " I would appreciate any input from you guys. My girlfriend isn't familiar with Reddit, so Im asking for her. She is a 3rd year student of Molecular Biology and has a big problem with her thesis topic, which is \" **enzymes of nucleic acid metabolism and it's usage in modern techniques of molecular biology** \". The problem is, she can't seem to find any compatible articles to source her thesis work. As the days go by, the pressure by her supervisor, that refuses to elaborate or help, to start writing, grows more and more. And as if that isn't enough, the supervisor said explicity to not use any \" review \" articles, although almost everysingle article is a \" review \" one and they even have sources, quoting other \" review \" articles.\n\n  \nMy girlfriend has started worrying about it and spends the whole day going through articles. So, I would really appreciate any help or input, if anyone is familiar with the thesis topic, or if anyone had a similar problem, any ideas etc. Thank you guys !",

        "text": "Hello, I'm trying to grasp on the concept of this experiment and I have a lot of questions about it\n\nSo the Dolly experiment is a succesful cloning experiment in which a nucleus from an adult (white) was taken into an egg cell, in a culture they replicated this cell to form an embryo, and then planted it into the black faced ship (am I correct till this point?)\n\nnow the question that rises is that when you implant an adult nucleus into an egg cell, isn't there a difference between a nucleus in egg cell and a somatic cell that there are genes that are expressed in one but not in the other? it could rise to 1000 problems, that's my main thinking here\n\nsecond, there isn't a need for a sperm gene? I do know now that in sperm cells there are things that are not expressed in an egg cell and as a result could rise to other problems? my main thinking is that this is an experiment, idealy woudn't be successful because of these first reasons, lot's of other reasons too\n\nthird an adult somatic cell isn't different from an embryo cell, genetically speaking of course, I can't seem to understand this experiment because of these reasons that are not explained in the textbook, maybe further on other courses\n\nin the textbook they correlate this with a genetic equivalence (all cells have the same genetic material, as I understood) that cloning is a proof for that, but my main issue is with the curiosity to that experiment\n\nthanks in advance",
