        "text": "I’m 25 female, that lives at home with parents after moving out for college just to come back because of inability to find and keep a job 1) making enough money to sustain myself and not struggle and 2) without me mentally breaking down at inconveniences I have at work or life in general. I moved out  on my own since 2019. I moved back home last year July. While on my own, I was having meltdowns but managed to push through. What brought me back home was lease ending and not finding job to sustain myself. But my anxiety and depression and whatever other issue I may have (adhd or undiagnosed autism highly functioning) makes life so unbearable at times, where I have meltdowns at inconveniences. When something at work happens like a conflict I have breakdowns. I want my own so bad and I feel so bad when my family remind me of where I’m suppose to be right now. Plus my friend always asks me “what am I doing with my life” and suggest me to do things. It’s depressing. I usually get super burnt out or depressed at jobs because I’m not making hardly anything working a lot of hours for little to nothing and  I can’t find a job in my field. Plus I’m highly anxious and socially awkward and people seem to sometimes talk about me for it. And I let’s it get to me. I’m in therapy right now and taking medication. But I truly don’t know how to get and stay on my own two feet. My family judge me so harsh for it. I’m taking steps to bettering my mental health, but it’s so hard. Why am I like this? My friend and family thinks I’m lazy. I’m just a sad tired girl living in a busy world.",

        "author": "tombnight",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/10yg64v/improving_your_sleep_efficiency_can_effectively/",
        "text": "“How’d you like to live an extra ten years? And I’m not just talking about a decade of decrepitness tacked on at the end of life, but another ten or fifteen percent of all ages, from your twenties through your golden years. Think of what you could do with all that extra time!”\n\nSo goes the sales pitch for a new medical procedure that reduces the need to sleep in a technothriller I published last year titled *Circadian Algorithms*. It obviously doesn’t turn out to be quite that simple in the novel—how boring that would be—but in the real world it *is* possible to achieve a similar benefit, and without adverse side effects. However, it’s woefully neglected, or at least only indirectly discussed.\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by sleep, but my extensive research and self-experimentation while writing the book taught me critical lessons about how best to approach the one-third of your life you spend asleep—or trying to sleep—that most people ignore.\n\n# The most important lesson for me was to focus on sleep efficiency.\n\nSleep efficiency is simply the amount of time you spend asleep divided by the amount of time you spend trying to sleep. So if you’re in bed for eight hours and get seven hours of sleep, your sleep efficiency is 87.5%. You want this number to be as high as possible because most people don’t enjoy time spent tossing and turning, and time spent on other pleasurable in-bed activities like reading or sex is excluded from the calculation.\n\nPer 23andMe I have a genetic marker in my ADA gene that makes me an especially deep sleeper, so I have an advantage. But like with almost everything, genes only give you a starting point and account for about half the story—the rest is up to you. Over the past several years my sleep efficiency has improved to where most nights I get my needed seven hours of shuteye by being in bed for seven hours and five minutes—my sleep efficiency is 99%. (when not suffering from jet lag or other circadian disruptions like having an infant)\n\nContrast this 99% with the average sleep efficiency of 85–90%, i.e. those who spend eight or nine hours in bed to get seven or eight hours of sleep, respectively. The 10% higher sleep efficiency gives you an extra hour per day, which is enough time to get in shape, take up a new hobby, read a book a week, or spend more time with friends and family. You could even just lounge in bed for an hour, as I do on the rare occasions my son allows, but it would be your choice. Even a 1% improvement in sleep efficiency gives you back 5–10 minutes a day, enough time to meditate—more on this later—or chip away at anything else you wish. Small changes applied consistently over long periods of time often have dramatic effects.\n\nMany people’s sleep efficiency is of course worse than average, resulting in 2–3+ hours spent tossing and turning. Eliminating this wasted time effectively results in many extra years of life, hence the title.\n\nTime is among our most precious assets (along with physical and mental health, relationships, and money). And we live in an increasingly time-impoverished age. What can you do to reclaim as much of this time as possible?\n\nIt’s tempting to steal extra time by sleeping less. While you should absolutely figure out how much sleep you really need and not overindulge—again, unless you choose to—sleep (along with exercise) is the closest thing to a super drug. You want your prescribed dose, which is another great way to add literal years to your life. Sleeping less to increase productivity is usually counterproductive because the adverse effects of sleep deprivation are so pervasive that you’re better off with fewer but higher-functioning hours in the day. (read Dr. Matthew Walker’s *Why We Sleep* for an excellent and alarming summary)\n\nThus improving sleep efficiency is the best option.\n\n# Improving Sleep Efficiency\n\nSome people are just genetically fucked when it comes to sleep and should consult a doctor, but most doctors and sleep experts will tell you that medicating the problem should be a last resort. All the standard sleep advice will also improve sleep efficiency, so you should start with the basics and use one of the many sleep trackers to see what works for you:\n\n* Keep as consistent of a sleep schedule as you can. I generally shift mine back by a few hours on weekends, but hey you’ve got to live a little.\n* Minimize alcohol (again, you’ve got to live a little…sometimes a lot).\n* Avoid caffeine and other stimulants in the afternoon.\n* Don’t use your phone for at least an hour before bed and ensure it’s in a mode that won’t disturb you overnight. Also, if you *really* want to find more time in the day, look at your phone’s screen time report and estimate how much TV you watch, then realize you likely have much more time available than you think.\n* Ensure your bedroom is sufficiently dark, cool, and quiet.\n* Find the right mattress and bedding, even if it’s expensive (“spend your money where you spend your time”).\n* Understand your chronotype and try to adapt your schedule accordingly. Modern productivity culture loves early risers, but if you’re genetically not a morning person then you shouldn’t fight it. Sure, you can wake up at 4am, but if that means you need to be in bed by 8pm then you don’t have any more hours available to you than someone who is in bed from 1am to 9am. And you’ll be much better off if you maximize how much of that time is actually spent sleeping.\n\nBut sleep efficiency is really about how quickly you fall asleep, both initially and whenever you wake up during the night. Those with kids understand the importance of the right bedtime routine, and you should test and iterate to find what works best for you. I read for about 30 minutes in the dark until I can barely keep holding my Kindle, then instantly drift off.\n\nSomething excluded from most sleep advice but that I’ve found more useful than anything else is to **avoid late-night brooding and rumination.** Do not spend the hour before bed arguing with your spouse, doomscrolling, watching the news, or doing anything else that will get your mind spinning in the wrong direction. And if you wake up in the middle of the night, do not dwell on the coming day’s challenges. Everything seems so much worse, every problem so intractable, in the middle of the night. This is of course easier said than done, but learning to meditate is a perfect solution. You do not have to be a slave to whatever negative thoughts bubble up from the ether of your mind in the small hours. A recent study showed that meditation is as effective as prescription medication for reducing anxiety. It’s not just a Silicon Valley fad. It works.\n\nAlrighty, well I hope I’ve at least convinced you to think about improving your sleep efficiency. What you discover could be immensely useful until the technology from *Circadian Algorithms* and other science fiction becomes a reality.",

        "text": "Heyhey, after the past 31 days I completed my first ever month-long extreme dopamine / consumism detox and I wanted to share my motivation, results, realisations (and some techniques). For the few people on this sub who don't know what it is, when people talk of \"dopamine detoxing\" they usually mean the abstinence of activities that provide \"cheap\" pleasure. I won't go into the science of dopamine detoxing since there's a lot of people who know and explain it better. I won't post the link to the video, but the youtube channel \"Better than Yesterday\" has made an excellent video covering all the science you need to know. It's the latest on the channel called \"Stop Wasting Your Life - Take Control Instead\" (Please don't ban me mods, I don't wan't to spread inaccurate information that was poorly interpreted by me). This is the only video you need about this topic, NOTHING ELSE. It's the one video out of all the \"dopamine detoxing\" videos I've seen that has actually motivated me to finally do it, it offers excellent guidance. I full heartedly recommend you to check it out if you've thought about detoxing or are sick of entertainment-media controlling your life.\n\nMy rules: No YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, Newspaper apps, TV, Videogames, Spotify / CDs, books or anything related to quickly consume entertainment. I'll talk later about spotify and books, and why I didn't want to use them.\n\nWhat was allowed: Concerts, Theater / cinema, alcohol, actually informational stuff online from blogs / science sites (school, meditation, sports, mental health)\n\nFirst of all, this is the first time I am so happy, energised, concentrated and chill for such a long and continuous!!! time in my life. I 100% can recommend this to anyone who's lost online that want's to actually get their life under control.\n\nMy motivation was the video mentioned above. I was bound to the screen since the early days of my life, but never saw any problems with it. I've always played videogames and watched YouTube as a child, but I think it was an okay-ish amount. The problem was starting at high-school, Internet sites became more designed to be addictive, I played games just for the sake of playing them. I overdid it. I'm lucky I had a big social circle and was regularly pulled into nature through scout activities, but over the years I have definitely developed lots of bad habits and a social media addiction. And so have millions (or even billions) of people on the globe. The video above talks about this aswell, addiction doesn't always come in the form of what you think it will. I have experienced times in my life where I just layed in my bed and binge-watched YouTube, Anime, you name it for **5 - 10 hours**. This. is. not. normal. In order to see how addicted I actually am and to starve the neurological connections for the bad habits, I started with the challenge. And trust me, I was very afraid and nervous in the beginning, I even had several nightmares in which I went on my phone and browsed social media. I then woke up and felt very guilty, till I realised my brain just made that up. I'm glad I pushed through, after 2 weeks it was easy.\n\nNow, why in the world would I boycott spotify and books? I have experimented with detoxing in the past and found, that if I have spotify at hand, I'd just listen to music and not do a thing, because I was craving the entertainment so much. Once I removed spotify, same happened with books. I just binge-read entire novels because I was afraid of getting bored. But becoming bored IS THE POINT. So many people fear boredom, it's actually insane. What you tend to forget when you can fight off boredom immediately with your phone or whatever, is that the feeling of boredom goes by surprisingly quickly. What either happens is you accept doing nothing and chill / nap or you start reflecting about your day/life/activities whatever and regain your mental focus. I'm not saying you should get bored on purpose and immediately lie on the floor (even though I would recommend trying it out), but once you do get bored and you decide to rest, you can regenerate so much energy. And it really does make a difference in your daily life, if you let yourself rest / get bored more than usual. And PS: Sports is also possible without music, being aware of your muscles in your body can actually improve performance.\n\nAm I enlightened after 1 month of detoxing? Absolutely not. I'm just as flawed as before, BUT I cut out all the shit that held me back from becoming a better person. You would not accelerate your car while still pressing your foot on the brake pedal, right? And that's basically what happened to me: I started studying frequently for university, I woke up in the morning consistently, (even more important) I went to bed more consistenly, I went to the dentist and orthopedist to actually take care of some health problems, I spent more time with friends, finally took the step to look for a flat-share to move out of my parent's house, meditated a lot, practiced my musical instrument more, learned to cook, the list goes on and on and on...\n\nThe simple magic of it all, I only shifted my focus from the realms of the web to my own life. **That's it.** The people on the internet doing funny and crazy stuff weren't interesting anymore, it was me. I was immediately more focused on my life and took the time to genuinely take care of my problems. It didn't even require any more mental enerygy, I just had nothing else to do.\n\nNow that my month is over I started looking at YouTube again today. I was immediately disgusted. There is great stuff out there don't get me wrong, but let's be frank, it's 99% bull\\*\\*\\*\\* that you'll forget the moment it's over. It's not the content creator's fault, it's how all the social media systems work by design. If you take a step back from the never ending assembly line of content-sludge the big sites want you to feed into, you'll see how unberably toxic and (yeah even) boring this stuff is. If you consume this stuff all day, no wonder you'll feel crap afterwards. I haven't mentioned tiktok because I've never used it due to fear of getting heavily addicted to this stuff. TikTok is presumably the king of sludge-feeding people content-garbage.\n\nNow, I think ranting about this stuff isn't even necessary, every person on this sub knows exactly which their poisons are and actually aknowledging that is a big step. Once you detach yourself from them and look back, you'll see just how unimportant it all is.\n\nThe most important thing to ask yourself when deciding on which things to cut: Do I consume this piece of media lot? Why, what feelings arise while I do? Is there a way to actually find this in reallife? Yes? Then cut it out.\n\nFor the ones interested, my toolset of techniques for the detox:\n\n\\- (Really basic but necessary) Install a website blocker on your main devices. Even though you know you shouldn't go to those websites, sometimes it happens out of pure habit and you'll get reminded of your challenge quickly. And it builds some actual distance to those websites.\n\n\\- Deinstall all the games on your phone, you don't need them. If you crave sudoku while driving in the bus, at least do it on a newspaper or something (even though I would recommend learning to chill and do nothing while in idle situations)\n\n\\- Deinstall your browser on your phone or at least minimise the use. If something is very important, write it down, you can always google later. While in discussions, immediately googling stuff may seem helpful, but where's the fun in discussing if you google every little thing. And most of the time people don't care about the actual facts, so it's really not important.\n\n\\- In the beginning, frequently turn off your phone when you don't need it. You can always turn it on of course, but the small waiting time gives you time to think if it's actually important and may hold you back\n\n\\- The goal is to minimise phone-screentime as MUCH as possible, if you find a realistic reallife alternative to a useful app, go for it. These are the only apps I used: What's-App, Telephone, Google Calendar, Google Maps, Public-Transport-App, Contacs, Mail, Camera, File-Reader\n\n\\- Tell your friends and family your're abstaining for a month. Unless they're really toxic they will respect your decision. The more you inform about, the better. It builds some nice social pressure, and accountability is an extremely powerful tool. Only do not do this with people who are fanatically into that stuff. They might feel attacked by you, which makes it even more difficult for you to abstain if they're very important to you.\n\n\\- If you genuinely need a certain informational YouTube video, use the website Viewpure. Paste in the link and it shows you the video without all the youtube clutter + it removes ads. Or even better, if it's always the same video, just download it on any of the Yotube to Mp4 sites.\n\n\\- For more focus when using screen technology or browinsg in the internet for the important stuff, turn your devices to Black and white mode. If this idea disgusts you, ask yourself if the colors are really necessary. I only turned it off for google maps or if I had to look at a photo of something. But everytime I turned the colors back on I noticed just how overly saturated everything is our devices and the web. Color can really drain your focus, so you may want to eliminate that.\n\n\\- One of my favourite new habits: Planning my day in advance. At the beginning of the challenge I bought some tiny blocks of paper, of which I always kept one in my inner jacket pocket. I could take important notes very quickly and I drew a timeline of my day in the morning on it, so I never forgot to do any task no matter how small or big and found a realistic way of fitting it into the day. An actual calendar is important of course, I allowed that app on my phone.\n\n\\- Meditation. Takes care of the mental stuff. I mentioned a lot that resting and chilling is so very important, and meditation is the active practice of that. I feel more tranquill and recognise more clearly the things that are draining my focus and energy\n\n\\- No excuses: If you need certain things on the internet, really try to find them in real life, be it social contacts, emotional support, hangout-spaces, whatever. Think about the things that would make a Dopamin Detox difficult for you and find some alternatives. If there's a will, there's a way. (But a realistic approach to the detox is important of course)\n\n\\- Mindset: If you feel shitty and bad for no reason during the detox, be glad about it. Because those few moments where you really feel miserable are the most important. You'll have to remember the greater purpose of your journey, which makes the misery bearable. If it's not easy, that's a good sign.\n\n\\- (Again) Do what the video from \"Better than Yesterday\" says\n\nIf you read this far, thank you for your attention. If this post helps at least 1 person to get into a long Detox, then that would be incredible. I'll personally keep the habit of long, dedicated meditation in my day and keep on using some of my tools. If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask in the comments. But now excuse me, I need to listen to some music albums :)\n\nHave a nice day!",

I’ve recently lost my girlfriend due to my mindset and negative traits and ruined good friendships and I feel like I’m losing myself too. Currently been indulging in bad habits for the past couple week and abit(weed,porn etc). I tried to improve myself regarding my habits, thoughts and mental state for the past 2 years, I’ve improved abit but still it’s not been enough. Ik people could say I got my whole life ahead of me to figure this shit out but I really want to get rid of all this negative shit(or most of it)soon. Because Ik I have the potential to do good and be good Ive just lost the motivation and drive because of the situations I put myself into in the past. My life has more or less been stagnant for the last 2 years being a repeated cycle of trying to quit my porn addiction. I feel like this is one of the main reasons I don’t feel good enough within myself(aswell as my past traumas) and why I feel like I’m stuck in a hole. \n\nReally need advice on how to come out of this mindset and these traits, would much be appreciated.",

It’s getting unhealthy for me to the part where I’ll constantly feel like I’m being judged for just being in a room full of people. I wanna not care what people think, but everytime I’m around people I can’t help but wonder if they’re making fun of me inside their head for being a certain way or acting a certain way or the way I smile or talk etc. \n\n\nSometimes, when I’m feeling too overwhelmed or something my body starts to shake uncontrollably, I’ll start sweating but my temperature drops. There are certain moments where I get frustrated and I’ll try to speak but it’ll feel like my tongue is numb and tied and the words won’t come out properly or they won’t come out at all. I don’t know why this happens but this usually happens the most when I’m probably feeling too overwhelmed about something etc. I also get very angry quickly, it leads to me saying stuff during that moment then feeling bad about it later on. Or me telling someone about something or explaining my feelings then feeling guilty or embarrassed about it.\n\nI wanna start working on my mindset but I don’t know where to start, I’ve heard shadow work helps with issues like this. There are times where I’m perfectly fine and I’ll get too deep in my head and put myself in a bad mood. It’s easy for people to say “just don’t” when they have no idea what it feels like. It constantly feels like my mind is in a fog and I can’t even think straight, if someone is talking to me I just zone out I’m just not there. I can’t even concentrate on a conversation without my mind switching off midway. It just gets me thinking, what is wrong with me ? Am I crazy ? Why can’t I be normal ?\n\n\nI think I need to love myself and accept who I am to stop the insecurity and overall I just wanna feel good enough. Some will say “if you’re not making the change yourself then maybe you’re the problem” I’ve tried exercising but I somehow get into my head and the bad experience puts me off it. \n\n\n\nI need all the tips and advice I can get.",

        "text": "Well, if you've been around in self improvement circles for a while, you probably know what I'm talking about when I say self improvement is a rigged game. Our brains are hardwired to seek comfort, in all senses. It wants to eat highly calorical foods intuitively, because food that is now abundant was once scarce. Yet, If you indulge in this behaviour nowadays you'll get fat, which'll lower your lifespan, get some diseases up your ass, and what not. It is also rigged to store energy as much as possible, and for that reason most of us don't really feel like working out, because it is completely anti intuitive for us (deliberately deciding to spending energy). Yet, if you remain sedentary, your life span will probably also shorten, you'll probably less attractive than you could be, not to talk about the immense cognitive and psychological benefits you'll be missing. My point is that everything required to have so called \"success\" in the modern age is made by practicing activities which go directly against the functioning of our animal brains, and thus its easy to understand why it can be so frustrating trying to discipline yourself and begin to practice the habits that'll lead us to a more comfortable life. Through observation and my own experience, I perceived that you can only beat your mind in this game if you really see some deep, intrinsical meaning in the activity you want to do. Going to the gym is something I can really do without any effort, I don't really have to motivate myself to do because I simply like it, as the benefits (being more attractive, having better health) are simply very important for me, so my unconscious mind and body are able to justify the energy and time spent with it. The problem is that people may see no sense in going to the gym or any other activity deemed important, such as studying hard, meditating, etc. When someone complains about that they'll probably be met with someone saying they should rely on discipline, that it's a buildable skill. I don't think this is 100% bullshit, but I still hold my humble opinion that trying to do something you hate consistently through discipline alone will lead to nothing but frustration and failure.  If you look at people who are really great at what they do, you'll see that they're happy with doing the activity for the sake of itself, and that is the reason they can maintain it through their whole lives. So, maybe the path for being productive and efficient is choosing something that you are excited about naturally when you think about it, something that doesn't sound like a chore. Unfortunately that is still utopian for the majority of us, but it still worth thinking about it.",

It's never too late to start making good changes and improving yourself, no matter where you are in your path. Here are some pointers and tricks to get you going.\n\nStart by establishing yourself some achievable and realistic goals. Make sure they are specific and measurable whether they are short-term or long-term objectives. To keep yourself motivated, put your goals in writing and post them somewhere you can see them frequently.\n\nEstablish a habit: Maintaining a routine might help you stay organized and goal-focused. This can involve setting a regular wake-up and bedtime, taking frequent breaks, and setting aside time for self-care.\n\nLearn something new: By acquiring new knowledge each day, you may keep your mind sharp. This could be learning a new skill or interest, a new language, or both. It will not only keep you interested, but it will also make you feel accomplished.\n\nCreate a positive environment for yourself by surrounding yourself with upbeat individuals. Avoid negativity and controversy and instead concentrate on developing good relationships.\n\nSelf-care is essential for your entire wellbeing, therefore practice it. Be careful to obtain regular exercise, consume a balanced diet, and get adequate rest. Remember to set aside time for you to unwind and refresh.",

Maybe I'm just lazy and haven't gotten into the habit of reading when I haven't achieved anything good out of it, such as something worth learning.  \n\n\nAlso just as a side question: How do I absorb more from books I read? Or is annotating the only way? (Kind of two side questions, but the first one is more like the MAIN side question)",

I'm more angry, hopeless, directionless, and depressed than ever.\n\nIn high school, I started lifting weights, reading, eating healthy, spending time outside, little time on video games, little TV, social media. I came to the conclusion on my own - that it's better to improve yourself than sit around and play video games or watch tv.\n\nIn so doing, I thought, like all self-help gurus preach, my life would improve. It hasn't. I'm still alone, angrier than ever, and working a stupid, low-skilled job that I hate. I've tried joining Facebook groups, meetup, gone to events, volunteer. I've even moved states and jobs. I've spoken to countless career counselors, taken all sorts of career aptitude tests. Nothing helps.\n\nSo, that all being recognized - now what? Obviously, this is not normal, or good. So what happens when self-improvement fails to get you desired results? Thanks.",

It’s getting unhealthy for me to the part where I’ll constantly feel like I’m being judged for just being in a room full of people. I wanna not care what people think, but everytime I’m around people I can’t help but wonder if they’re making fun of me inside their head for being a certain way or acting a certain way or the way I smile or talk etc. \n\n\nSometimes, when I’m feeling too overwhelmed or something my body starts to shake uncontrollably, I’ll start sweating but my temperature drops. There are certain moments where I get frustrated and I’ll try to speak but it’ll feel like my tongue is numb and tied and the words won’t come out properly or they won’t come out at all. I don’t know why this happens but this usually happens the most when I’m probably feeling too overwhelmed about something etc.\n\n\nI wanna start working on my mindset but I don’t know where to start, I’ve heard shadow work helps with issues like this. There are times where I’m perfectly fine and I’ll get too deep in my head and put myself in a bad mood. It’s easy for people to say “just don’t” when they have no idea what it feels like. It constantly feels like my mind is in a fog and I can’t even think straight, if someone is talking to me I just zone out I’m just not there. I can’t even concentrate on a conversation without my mind switching off midway. It just gets me thinking, what is wrong with me ? Am I crazy ? Why can’t I be normal ?\n\n\nI think I need to love myself and accept who I am to stop the insecurity and overall I just wanna feel good enough. Some will say “if you’re not making the change yourself then maybe you’re the problem” I’ve tried exercising but I somehow get into my head and the bad experience puts me off it. \n\n\n\nI need all the tips and advice I can get.",

        "text": "Having fallen into a monotonous routine of work and study, I found myself feeling increasingly depressed and unproductive. I felt as though I had lost sight of my goals and my sense of purpose. As a result, I decided to undertake a challenge that would span 100 days and would be updated daily, with a focus on progress and milestones every 10 days.\n\nI am well aware that success may not be achieved in its entirety during these 100 days. Nevertheless, I am content as long as there is evidence of progress. Perhaps afterwards, I may embark on another challenge, this time with adjusted goals.\n\nAt present, I seek to address several areas that require improvement: \n\nFirstly, my job, while enjoyable and fulfilling, has taken a toll on my productivity. I find myself working like a machine and have little time for other activities. I aim to restore my work-life balance and improve my mental health. \n\nSecondly, I desire to acquire new skills, particularly in coding and finance. \n\nAdditionally, I aim to lead a healthier lifestyle and lose the 15kg I have gained over the past three years. My goal is to lose roughly 0.5kg per week. Reducing alcohol consumption is also required, for I have relied on it for far too long to suppress various psychological wounds. \n\nFinally, I hope to pursue a side hustle, if time permits.\n\n**The key performance indicators to track, along with their threshold will be the following:**\n\n\\-Consume under 3L of alcohol. (based on national average).\n\n\\- Consume 2L of liquids daily (I drink far too little, had 2 kidney stones in 5 years.)\n\n\\- Net a negative 100,000 calories. (makes physical activity mandatory)\n\n\\-Complete the Web Developer Boot Camp Certification. (503 lessons and projects to go through)\n\n\\- Add $10,000 to my net worth.\n\n\\- 1,000 hours of pure productivity (10h per day average)\n\n\\- Study for the CFA, complete up to 30% of the lesson plan.\n\n\\- Build SideHustle.\n\n\\- Walk 1 million steps\n\n\\- Complete 10 tasks per day, minimum (a task must take a minimum of 30 minutes to be considered valid).\n\nEach day I will reflect on my progress and document my experiences. Every 10 days, I will take stock of where I stand and assess my progress. I hope this will serve as a source of motivation for others and keep me accountable for my actions.\n\nThese indicators, while challenging, serve to show me where I stand versus where I wish to be. \n\nI will keep track and document daily and I invite you all to join me on this journey of 100 days.",

        "text": "Now that the headline has caught your attention, let me explain. This is going to be long so I apologize in advance.\n\nI 30M have been lonely since I can remember. I picked up video games at 11 years old and immersed myself in them immediately. So much so that it completely destroyed my sociability. This led to me getting picked on as a kid, not realizing social queues and never being invited anywhere. I had people in my life pick up and leave, with nobody ever sticking around. This has led to severe abandonment issues that plague me to this day. \n\nI’ve felt alone so long that I always tell myself, “I don’t need anybody, it’s just another hiccup in a life that’s not easy by any stretch of the imagination”. The truth is that I’m starving for human friendship but it always turns into the form of a relationship/hook ups. I’m in sales and I’ve always been a smooth talker, albeit with average looks. This sounds terrible but i can take a girl out and turn on the charm, but if you put me face to face with an everyday person I start stuttering and I look down at my feet. I obviously have extremely low self esteem and even with months of therapy I’m not feeling any better. \n\nI’m constantly talking/flirting with multiple woman at a time and I’ve realized it’s not because I enjoy being a “player”. It’s because I’m tired of looking at my phone day after day, week after week, month after month and seeing nothingness. Add to this that I have ADHD (diagnosed) so I’m always looking for a dopamine rush that doesn’t come to me naturally. Im not proud of the way I treat woman, but it’s the only type of interaction I’ve been able to have and I’m getting to the point where I’m not sure what to do. \n\nTl;DR: I’ve been a loner my entire life who craves human friendship. I use woman via sex to fill that void even though I know it’s terrible. I want to change but my lack of social awareness/sociability has been it extremely difficult to keep people around.",

        "text": "**PERSONAL BACKSTORY**  \nI remember back to the days when I was completely leading my own life, away from the influence of family who pressure me to do 'what's good/best for me'. Those days, I was never scrolling, binge eating or watching Netflix. I wanted to be outdoors doing activities and trying new things. I was incredibly optimistic. Though I REALLY didn't want to, I moved back into my family home due to a funky relationship ending, and I'm glad I got over it. But now I find I've been hating my home country, and University which I joined because I felt the pressure from my family of not 'wasting' my life. I'm doing 'What's best/good for me' yet I spend 6+hours a day on screens, never want to do Uni work, binge-eating and can't bring myself to exercise in the FREEZING cold. I dream of my life before returning home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**&gt; MAIN POINT &lt;**  \nSo I'm wondering if escapism is a sign that we should asses our lives, and whether what we are doing is actually what WE want to be doing, or if it's just a plan set by societal standards, family pressures, and silly expectations that we have to do something 'useful' and not just something we love. Something that makes us go 'W.O.W' in awe with our jaws hanging open. \n\n  \nIn my life before I moved back home, I was constantly seeing things and doing things, achieving things, like cycling up mountains, and these simple things just gave me so much awe I could cry. I'd never felt so free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MY OPINION**  \nIn my personal opinion, I believe life should be enjoyed and we shouldn't force ourselves to do things we hate for an unnecessarily long period of time. Sure, you could do a 7 year degree to become a lawyer/surgeon to please your parents and so you can feel good about yourself. Then after graduation  you're earning a hefty income. But what if you had the worst mental health possible from age 18-25 because studying that much, and that amount of pressure, is just unnatural. Of course we need a variety of professionals in society, but not all people are suited or raised to successfully handle that amount of stress without it harming them emotionally and physically longterm. Stress can have longterm effects on our physical and emotional health, and we only have one body, one life, so is it worth it?   \n\\- For some people it is, definitely, I'm talking about those who pretend they're fine when they're not, and sometimes people don't realise they're not happy because they've not experienced true enjoyment of life before, with lack of experience and variety - a direct line from Kindergarten to degree to career\n\nOf course it's a personal analysis each of us has to do on ourselves, but I think most people don't really think properly about what THEY want, because they're worrying about who they will disappoint or how they will look in the eyes of others, what it is just not important.",

        "text": "When it comes to relationships, we often use manipulation as a way of getting our needs met. This might take the form of flattery, playing on someone's sympathy, or using physical appearance to influence others. However, this behavior stems from a lack of trust in the power of true love.\n\nTrue love comes without any ulterior motives. It is selfless and unconditional, and it is the foundation of relationships that last. A great example of this is the love between a mother and her child. A mother's love for her child is typically unconditional. She does not expect anything in return for her love, and it is this selflessness that creates a strong bond between the two.\n\nOn the other hand, when we manipulate others, we build walls around ourselves that prevent real love from flowing. This can lead to feelings of emptiness and loneliness, despite the fact that others may seem to like us.\n\nBreaking down these walls and embracing vulnerability takes courage, but it is the first step in experiencing true love. When we trust in the power of love, we open ourselves up to the possibility of deep, meaningful relationships with others.",

He fully became a mindless worker.\n\nBut my friends say that one wants a normal job by being an editor and wants people to laugh (in a good way) at his editing skills and the other says his parents are happy they can help people by being therapists, but honestly I see it as an excuse to be motivated to work.\n\nHere's the worst part, they are worried about ME.\n\nThey think the fire inside my soul is burning way too much and I'm willing to sacrifice anything to fullfill my resolve, including friendships, they're afraid I'm becoming a mindless robot and break down being heartless, they're afraid of me having a burnout because all of the things I do might make me become crazy in the head, which I personally think its bullshit, they tell me to enjoy right now but I believe I have to suffer, so I can enjoy the rest of my life, They lack trust and faith in me.\n\nThey said they think ahead of their life after I told them they have no life plan for the future, but I think they should think further, not for the next year, but for decades. But they insist on focusing on the present.\n\nThey said I'm being forceful about this, perhaps I am.\n\nI was never able to persuade them into self improvement, they told me to succeed first, and will just think \"cool\", and will only come to me when they actually need help and they are at their lowest moment\n\nThis arugment lasted 3 hours and some of us cried, and it ended off with no ending because we lacked time.\n\nThe reason I'm trying to persuade these guys are because I've known them for such a long time they basically feel like family, I do not want to give up on them, I am honestly shocked they completely disagreed to the idea and told me I changed in a weird way, despite in a good way.\n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to tell you is, be careful who you tell self improvement to.\n\nIt either can ruin or develop your relationships.",

For some background I am in NJROTC and have been all four years of high school. Being in this program has taught me how to be a leader and to really be prepared for the world. I used to come to school very early to do push-ups and sit-ups and then stay after really late for drill practice. And I loved it. I loved being there for people who needed me and I liked how confident I was becoming in myself as a leader. Then senior year happen. And all that happiness went down the drain. \n\nIn my NJROTC unit by your senior year you get a leadership role. I become my companies Executive Officer which is the second highest position. And I also become commander of two drill events. So as you can imagine I am pretty busy and very needed. Getting in these positions completely changed my feelings for it. I feel like I’m doing it because I need to not because I want to. \n\nSo now I don’t wake up as early as I used to, I dread going to drill practice after school. And now I have also become very unmotivated to do my homework and go to the gym. And even at home, I am to unmotivated to wash my face and brush my teeth or even brush my hair. Cause everyday is the same and it isn’t fun anymore. And it doesn’t help that me and my now ex boyfriend broke up 2 weeks ago which has made my motivation plummet even further. \n\nAfter high school I am going into the Navy which I know will be fun because it will be different and exciting. But how can I change for these last 4 months of high school? How can I get over this burnout? I miss being excited and motivated and positive to do things. How can I get that girl back?",

I just feel it’s annoying that a current task taking me 7 weeks and still not finished and it’s part of a big project “personal not related to work” \n\nAny thoughts on this is appropriate!\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "Confidence is crucial in your career and in your personal life.\n\nWhen you have self worth, when you recognize your own value, you have self confidence.\n\nSelf worth comes from knowing who you are. What do you love? What are your boundaries? What won't you do? What do you want to do more of in life? What do you want to experience and feel more of in your life?\n\nWhen I ask somebody who are you? A lot of times people will tell me, I'm a doctor I'm a professional but those are just roles and labels that you carry in life. What you need to do is, you need to go on a journey of self-discovery and introspection.\n\nThe best ways to discover yourself, your self worth, and your value is by:  \n\\- Introspecting through meditating  \n\\- Going on long walks and spending time alone in nature  \n\\- Journaling with writing prompts such as \"what do I love to do? what are my hobbies? what are the things that I don't like to do? what do I want to do more of in my life? how do I want to feel when I wake up in the morning? what would be my perfect day, and why is it perfect?\"\n\nGet comfortable with just who you are. Know that you're worthy and know that you're pure love.",

Complete total relaxation and no thoughts. \n\nSo this is based on how I manage to do something everyday for a week, then I burnout so severely that it's embarrassing. And I've realised the reason for this is I get insanely optimistic and start thinking non stop unique thoughts for hours on end every single day all day. Positive thinking is good usually. But with me it's causing servere burnout.\n\nSo how do I completely cut off all my thoughts at will? I do a good activity, the thoughts appear like crazy. I need them gone when the time comes. Meditation is the first thing that comes to mind. But some days I'm not in the mood to meditate. Any other ideas?",

I just want someone to send funny stuff to and confide in. \n\nWhen I was a kid the only friends I had abandoned me when I became depressed. Before abandoning me they were cruel: telling me I was annoying, stupid, a buzz kill and literally abandoning me when we were at the mall or anywhere else. I was diagnosed with bipolar after high school and I had to take 5 years off basically from life to get better. I was hospitalized, tried countless meds and eventually had ECT. Because of the taboo of this time I feel like I have a gap in my life I can’t talk about. \n\nI went to University but I was 5 years older than everyone else. I couldn’t relate. I ended up taking another 2 year break for other reasons and now I’m at least 7 years older than people in my year. \n\nI really missed out on learning how to socialize and make friends. Plus I’ve been burned by people I’ve let close and been told I’m weird, annoying by people who said they cared about me. I also feel I am harbouring this secret that would send someone running that got close to me (even though no one would be able to tell that I have bipolar. It has been in remission for years.). \n\nSo… how do you make friends nowadays? What do you do when you meet people? What do you look for in a friend?",
