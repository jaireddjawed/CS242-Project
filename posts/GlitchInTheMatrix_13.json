She was in the corner so there’s no bloody way one of the balls could have disappeared right? \n\nI saw the damn thing land sat the corner and then it just wasn’t there. \n\nI’ve spent 20 minutes trying to understand how it happened and my brain is fried. The cat dimension is real. This a glitch in the fucking matrix. I’ve also lost one of my cat’a favourite toys and now have to get another one. Great \n\nUpdate: just threw another ball at the corner and it’s gone. Ended up getting a tiny bit hysterical and called one of the housemates to see. Turns out that there’s a hole in the back and had to forcefully remove the wooden panel and bam, turns out that’s where the balls went. I feel like an idiot now and also I think my housemate (Aussie) went a bit irritated at me and got rather high pitched and asked me some rather personal questions. Oof my fragile feelings... well once upon a time fragile feelings and currently neutral eh? ??? Slightly irritated feeling back ",

        "text": "Back when I was in grade 4 (8 years old), I was walking through a popular local shopping mall. I was an 8 year old boy with long hair (because I thought having long hair would be cool) and would often be mistaken for a girl.\n\nI wasn't usually on my own, but my mum had trusted me with some money to get myself something to eat in the food court. While walking through the food court, I walked past a boy (I distinctly remember him as a boy) sitting on his own. We met eyes briefly before I kept walking.\n\nJust after my gaze parted, it occured to me that he looked kinda like me. So I sort of slowed my pace, went to the other end of the food court, and then turned around and walked past again, trying to get just another look. He looked up again too, still on his own, with a burger in his hands. He stared up at me with his mouth open, frozen, about to take a bite, like something was up. He looked EXACTLY like me. Long hair, olive skin, skinny kid.\n\nOf course, I was way too stunned and shy to approach this kid when my mum had told me just to get something to eat. So I just went off. I don't remember what happened after that.\n\nNow I always regret not saying something. I mean we both clearly had an experience of recognition, and we both said nothing.\n\nSo here I was, continuing my life as per normal. I loved to read guinness book of world records and massive science encyclopedias and stuff in the school library free reading time (anything to get out of real books) because they had pictures and cool facts. I have always loved knowing fun facts to impress others with and realize as I type this, it is something I have always carried with me into adulthood.\n\nI had read in this book at some point before this encounter about twins in biology. There was a cool excerpt about mirror twins, who are identical twins but features like beauty marks might be reversed or one is right handed and the other left. Then there was another small excerpt on twins that had been seperated at birth to examine difference in them as they grew up and some of the results. I recalled this moment exactly, and was completely convinced I was a twin and part of an experiment. As any normal kid would do, I absolutely grilled my mum and she insisted I was the only one born. \n\nI dropped it, but still had this eery feeling I was just waiting for the experiment to end. I'm 24 now and often have people ask me if I know a guy named X, because I look like him. I always ask who in hopes of finding this guy. But it's always someone who looks fucking nothing like me or they don't have a photo. So I've put it down to having a familiar face and forgotten about it, until this subreddit.",

        "text": "So, I was coming back from buying stuff for dinner. I had two bags on my handlebars: One with a gallon of milk and a bottle of good Lodi red wine, the other with groceries. I happened to be walking my bike because at this one intersection I have to stop, push the button and wait quite awhile for the light to change. So, it turned green, and I was crossing the street when this car comes out of nowhere going really fast straight at me. Next thing I know, my bike is totalled. Front forks bent so bad the wheel won't turn. Back wheel broken off the bike completely. I'm fine.  I locked the wreckage of my bike to a pole, picked up the back wheel &amp; my groceries, and walk home. I come inside and tell my son what happened. He said, \"Wait a minute. You have to walk a bike by the handlebars. How did he hit the bike and not hit you?\" I didn't have an answer for that. Didn't break the bottle of wine either; or the glass Santa Lucia candle I had just bought. ",

        "text": "My ex and I used to have a mini fridge next to our bed when we lived together, because we're both incredibly lazy.  Anyway I had these ridiculous Dilbert magnets on the fridge which I'd gotten at a yard sale when I was younger.  I honestly hated them, but they were good magnets.  \nSo one day my ex convinced me to smoke weed with him in our bedroom, and while we were laying there talking to each other I turned and became fixated on the Dilbert magnet.  Honestly I had had enough of looking at it, so I took it, and threw it toward the wall (which was only just behind the fridge maybe 2 feet away). When I did that, I saw the magnet fall away into shadow and disappear completely (but as I was high I just thought it looked cool and that I was hallucinating). My ex turned to me and said \"I was just thinking about doing that.  Weird\".  \nSo a couple of hours later when I had sobered up, I went to pick the magnet up from the floor. However, it was nowhere to be seen.  There was nothing for the magnet to fall behind, into, or to have been obscured by.  It was just a wall and a bare floor.  We never did find it, even after we moved out.  6 months later I asked the new tenant who I was actually friends with whether they had seen it when they moved in.  Nope.  To this day I think I may have sent Dilbert to another dimension.  ",

I tell her I'm nowhere near [city] with no intention or reason to go there and that my number is the same as ever. She then forwards me a text reading something like this: Hey [somewhat unusual pet name I sometimes call her], I'm in [city] now. I am scared, but okay and it's safe here. Your sister.\n\nYeah. That was kind of creepy. We both called the number it came from, it just kept ringing. Eventually we shrugged it off as some sort of bizarre coincidence and it probably is. Nothing else happened, no more texts, no calls and nothing similar. But I think about it now and then and still don't know what to make of it. My thoughts:\n\n- a joke. I don't know who or why or even how, because the name used in the text isn't what I call my sister in public or often, but it's a possibility I guess\n\n- wrong number combined with coincidence. That's probably the solution, black swans and all of this\n\n- glitch in the matrix ;)\n\nSo, yeah, if you have any ideas, go wild!\nDefinitely one of the weirdest things that ever happened to me.\n",

Well today she [walked into the house with a third one!](https://imgur.com/a/x7aFu)  This new one is similar, but definitely different. Not like the first time where they were very similar.  This one is also new and not weathered. I went to California 2 weeks ago, and my Mother in Law watched the dog.  She bought the original toy, I suspected she brought the second one but she denies it. I think it must be her. Waiting on a response...\n\nOk she replied while I was uploading the pic. It was her that brought the new one. I’m thinking she must have brought the second one and forgot about it.  So case closed? This sounds pretty mundane I guess, but it really freaked me out for a while. ",

I was trying to mount a cpu cooler, but got frustrated because I couldn't figure it out so I sat down in the office chair with my back facing the door and got on my phone just then I got a huge wave of that feeling you get when you have Deja Vu, but the events were wrong. My room mate was supposed to walk up behind me and startle me and then he would tell me that I have to push down harder on the mount, but he never did. This threw me off so much that I walked downstairs to find him, but he wasn't home yet. I went back into the room and pushed down harder on the cpu cooler and what do you know it worked! I acquired new knowledge from a memory that never happened? You may think I'm remembering something different, but it's impossible the setting was exactly where I was, sitting in his office chair with my back to the door with the exact lighting and everything, but that was the first time I had ever sat in his chair and we've only lived together for like 2 months. \n\nSorry if this is a cluster fuck to read.

        "text": "This is my first time posting on this subreddit - or any reddit, for that matter. I am obviously very new to this, so I apologize in advance for any formatting issues or anything of the sort.\n\nI'll start off with a minor introduction:\nMy name is Tali, and I have had very few experiences with 'glitches'. Anything odd that I have witnessed can usually be explained by a trick of the eye, as well as other things along the same line. Some of my minor 'experiences' include: seeing one of my cat's paws under the door, only to find out that they were too far away at the time to have been there, seeing my mom's car pull up, only to look back to an empty parking lot as she truly pulls in, that kind of stuff.\n\nThis, however, really stuck out to me. This happened a week or two ago, and I have just forgotten to post it as of late due to working lights for a musical, a job interview, and building my own electric guitar. \n\nThis story is pretty short, (I honestly wouldn't be at all surprised if that background was longer than the story itself) so I'll keep it simple.\n\nBack in October of 2017, there was a Homecoming bonfire at a local high school. I went with a few of my friends, bringing not much more than a purse with me. Around my neck, I wore this golden watch necklace, due to the fact that the theme of Homecoming was Harry Potter. I was never much of a fan of HP myself, but I did know about the Golden Snitches, and figured this was the closest I could get. \n\nAbout halfway through the event, the suggestion of capture the flag came up. I took my necklace off, put it into my purse (which I zipped), and asked my friend to hold onto it for me while I played a few rounds. \n\nWhen they gave my purse back, however, the watch was gone. I found it odd that the chain was perfectly in-tact, while the watch was nowhere to be found. I asked my friends if they had touched it, and they said they didn't. I trust them, because I've never known a single one of them to lie to me. Plus, the bag was still zipped exactly how it had been before. I figured I had just carelessly lost it. It was of no real sentimental or cash value, so I simply continued on with my night. \n\nEverything went smoothly, and in the months following, I forgot about the watch entirely.\n\nThat is, until it decided to show up.\n\nI am constantly digging around in my backpack, and I am always aware of all of its contents. I had a bag of jellybeans in there, due to Easter being two days prior. I was offering some to my friends (a different group of friends, I should add)  when I realized the bag had ripped open more, thus causing the candy to spill. I told them to hang on as I scooped the loose jellybeans from my bag in order to avoid any future mess. As I felt around the bottom of my bag, I noticed a cold metal disc between my fingers. I pulled it out, confirming my suspicion. There, perched between my middle and forefinger, was the watch.\n\nNow, I should add that I don't recall putting that purse in my backpack at all, let alone unzipped, so this shouldn't be possible. Secondly, I dig around in this pocket every day, and not once has this appeared before.\n\nI pulled it out and stared at it, setting it on the desk. My friends asked what it was. I rubbed my finger along the small clock's surface, replying only with the phrase \"there's a piece of glass missing.\"  The four of us cracked some jokes about finding the glass lodged in one of the jellybeans, but I quickly located the missing piece; it fit perfectly where it had once belonged.\n\nI think the clock read 6:53, if I'm remembering correctly. The clock itself never worked, but I would always set it to specific numbers. Note,  653 was never one of them. That number has no significance to me.\n\nAlmost two full weeks later now, I still can't figure this one out. If anyone has a logical explanation, please let me know, as it would be much appreciated to hear your theories. Thank you for reading this post, and I hope you found it as interesting as I did that day.",

When we are deep in our subconscious, when nothing else is distracting us. \n\nI’ve researched this because for the past few years I have been recognising a pattern in my dreams.. I die a lot in my dreams not every dream of course. But I have been dreaming of dying for aslong as I can remember. I am always aware that I’m dying it’s never painful and it’s usually in very mundane ways I’m sitting im a chair and pass away, I hemorage when giving birth the most frighting was when I died in a TUI plane crash. but I know I’m over and it’s just black after that I am still dreaming remember just black nothingness. It’s strange right. \n\nSo going back to what I said at the beginning what if I have died in all of my timelines as they exist together and am able to unlock this memory in sleep? \n\nI know it’s mental and no I’m not high just a thought.

        "text": "Yesterday afternoon about one, I take a bath after playing tennis and doing some errands.  As usual, I'm filling the tub, get in, get the temp right, start reading, and turn the water off when full.  I'm reading a great book, don't urgently have to be where I need to be, so stay for a while.  After the bath I do all the things I do - moisturize, , dress, makeup - whatever. ...and go about my day.  Note; I don't drain the tub, as is often the case.  I keep the water until it cools to water plants, etc... Later I used that bath room to use the toilet, brush teeth, wash face....as usual and I eventually go to bed.  I pee at least once, sometimes more during the night\nThis morning I'm waking up and I hear water.  I sort of shake off sleep and take out my earplugs (noisy neighbors) and listen carefully.  Definitely not the usual water in pipes sound.  Water is running!  I go into the bathroom which is where it seems to be coming from.  Instantly I feel warm moist air.  I turn on the light and the hot water in the bathtub is ON, about medium strength and the water precariously high in the tub.  \nI turn it off - utterly puzzled.  I reach in to feel the water - totally hot, so much so if I wanted to get in I'd have to let it cool for a bit.  I decide someone wants me to take a bath this morning - at the same time doing a big reality check (lucid dreaming technique).  So I wait a bit to get in.  Interestingly when I do eventually get in, about 2/3rds down the water is icy cold.  I make my way in, mix up the hot and cold and have a little bath, given to me by I don't know who.  \nI share my space with two cats.  I highly confident they didn't turn on the hot water this morning.\nWho did?",

We sat in small groups and I was at a table with my best friend, V, and a few other girls. \n\nThe room we were in was decorated with memorabilia of various iconic artists, but one stood out from the rest - Michael Jackson’s face was painted on the ceiling and pictures of the artist were hanging from the walls. We were admiring the decor when my friend naively asked - isn’t Michael Jackson dead? Every other girl looked at her and yelled “NOO,” offended by the ignorance of one of the greatest artists to ever roam this earth. She quickly apologized, the topic changed, and no more than 5 minutes later, suddenly there it was ...\n\n“BREAKING: MICHAEL JACKSON DEAD.” We sat there in silence for a while and an eerie feeling crept over us.

        "text": "New to this sub, saw this subreddit highlighted on YouTube, and immediately thought of this, which happened around 3 years ago. I had just walked to a small food place in San Luis Obispo, CA, called Tiki Hut and gotten some rice and chicken, and I also got a vanilla cream root beer, which was in a glass bottle. I walk home, around a block away, place my stuff down and sit on the couch. I start watching a video and I open my root beer which had a metal cap on it and set it down. I start getting into my food when my drink suddenly shoots out root beer, spilling all over the table and floor. It wouldn't have been weird, but the thing was it happened a good 10-15 seconds after I opened the bottle. I could not figure out what the heck could have caused such a delayed reaction, nor do I understand to this day. Also have no idea whether or not this type of story belongs on this channel. Has this happened to anyone before though? Some kind of delayed reaction to a drink that got shaken up?\n\nedit: spelling, grammar",

        "text": "A little backstory: Back when I was around 10, I got a Gameboy Advance as well as a copy of Pokemon Crystal. I was so exited to play it and so I did. I played the living crap out of that game. I would always go up to the Elite 4 and then I would restart the game all over (because I only trained my starter and thus I never managed to beat it) I probably did this like 10-12 times before it got washed in the washer and it didn't work anymore. \n\nAnyways here is the weird part, I don't ever remember there being animated sprites when a Pokemon comes out nor have I seen the game announce what area you entered. I do remember the battle animation being on and I definitely played Crystal because I sometimes played as the female trainer and the Eugine-Suicune event that happens. \n\nI was totally surprised when later I found out the Pokemon have animations when they're brought out. Seeing that I have played Crystal numerous times, you might think that 10 year old me would at least pick a favorite Pokemon animation, no?\n\nI asked everyone else and no one seemed to have the same experience. It's actually creepy",

        "text": "As a student in college, and a member of the community council, it's my duty to help assist the other officials with various tasks, and to provide feedback when necessary. One of these tasks which we accomplished a few days ago was to create posters for an upcoming event that we're running.\n\nNow, I'm sure you all know that schools love to be cheap. This meant that all of our posters were made out of crummy butcher paper, and that we had to create these posters by hand rather than printing them out. It took a few hours to do so, but finally, we finished them all, and put tape around the edges and middle of each poster, allowing them to stick to the wall.\n\nWell, today, I walked into the lobby and discovered the posters laying on the ground. Oh, no worries, this happens all the time! All I have to do is stick it back onto the wall!\n\n... Except the tape had completely disappeared! Butcher paper tears when you remove tape from it, yet, the posters weren't torn or anything. It's like the tape had simply vanished! To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I checked with the other members of the council, and we had, in fact, used a crap-ton of tape.\n\nSo, where'd it all go? How were they removed from the posters without them tearing? It's as though the tape had simply disappeared from existence!",
