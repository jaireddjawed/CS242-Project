It feels like a watered-down version of the much more gritty, hard-hitting dystopias that Black Mirror writes. I guess you could argue there are episodes that don't fit into the Black Mirror universe and maybe I'm making the mistake of comparing them.\n\nThe writing feels derivative and like the kind of thing an edgy-16 year old would write, I was hoping for something more insightful than what I've seen so far.\n\nAny thoughts?",

Usually the discussion of violence is how seeing it all the time desensitized people. But in this episode, by not seeing violence, the girl wasn't able to process situations properly, or even be able to properly see the consequence of her actions. For example, while bludgeoning her mom, she didn't see a person, but just a blob. But once she did what she was doing, she realized what she had done and fled. So in a way, it was necessary for her to be exposed to things so she could see the humanity behind certain bad acts. In contrast to the boy who saw all sorts of messed up things, but could more properly distinguish between reality and constructs (such as his comment about  \"porn girls\".\")",

How could anyone think this was humane at all? Even if you take a human out of these equations , the functionality of it. It's moronic. You have a conscious living in a stuffed monkey with only 2 options for the rest of it's (Infinite) days. And now suddenly deleting them is illegal? Why! They're not really people. There obviously no afterlife for them. Why perpetuate the misery and keep them alive? It just makes no sense.\n\nThen you have White Christmas. I understand that the entire point behind the last scene was to illustrate what cookies could be  made to do. Live 1000 years per second, which equates to a few million years (Bunch of different people calculated how many days he was in there for).\n\nThis is the police force that is using this technology, doesn't get much more authoritative than that... and they torture these things.\n\nAs I've said, the only ones outside of the box was in the Infinity game, and everyone already viewed him as twisted and evil.\n\nI know it's all fiction, but still....\n\nI love this series, just started watching it last week but some of these concepts are downright idiotic. Like the transfer of consciousness from one human to another. ",

I oscillate between yes and no but I want to hear other viewers thoughts.\n\n**Edit:** I'll explain my take. You're free to disagree with me. I personally think he was better off not knowing. He had, from what we can tell, a pretty good life. The build of his house, the interior, a nanny, friends who threw lavish dinners, and more ‚Äî these things all suggested a life of good wealth; a social ranking that not many have. Fundamentally, he seemed uncomfortable with himself. His poor esteem became instantly evident when he revisited his job interview, poring over gestures and details, belaboring little signs to no end. In his case, the grain was more of a curse than a memory aid. \n\nRe: Infidelity. As someone who has been cheated on, I understand his misery, confusion, humiliation, and pain. Depending on how far we were into our relationship, I would take significant measures. But if I had a young child (even if s/he wasn't mine) and a spouse and an otherwise pretty OK life, I would take a breather and step away from the relationship. Clear my head and *then* take a decision. He went berserk.\n\nHis wife cheated on him, yes, but she seemed to have dedicated herself to their home, their child, and spousal responsibilities. They could've had a series of intense, painful conversations, and still make it work. She would have to beg for forgiveness and promise never to do anything like that again. She would have to actively keep that promise. It would take commitment, brutal honesty, and time. It would take patience. But it could work. It has worked with other couples. With the grain, everything seemed to have accelerated to extremes. He destroyed what could've been salvaged. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things (if we were to get epistemological and what-not), he didn't need to know. Now he has nothing. He has no one.",

Just wanted to have a general discussion about what everyone would love to see in this upcoming season that they have yet to see in past seasons! For me, I‚Äôd love an episode where our technology becomes so advanced that we are able to finally travel into space (not like USS Callister) and we finally come across other living life forms such as humans who have yet to ‚Äúadvance‚Äù (think of cavemen times). And how we react to teaching them about everything we know and have learned. Idk, just a though but would love to hear your crazy ideas about an episode you‚Äôd love to see! Cheers!",
