        "text": "Hello, Travis Marcella here, You should go see other parts before this one so you understand my situation clearly...[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11kc214/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_ive_uncovered/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11lavnl/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_now_something/).\n\nI woke up to see that nothing had changed. I was still in the same room with no way out. I looked around and glanced up to see a vent that was tightly locked with screws. I searched around for a screwdriver, feeling the books for some secret button, checking under my bed, and searching the desk. I found a toy box in the corner, under my bed. Oddly, I found this strange as I was almost an adult and I thought myself a bit old to be playing with such things. I looked inside and found many useless toys such as action figures and small cars. At the bottom of the toy box i found a toy screwdriver. \n\n\"Perfect\" I whispered under my breath.\n\nI went to the vent and unhinged the vent cover rather easily. It felt a bit strange that escaping would be so easy but I assumed that they underestimated me. I quickly got into the vent shaft and began moving as slowly as possible to not make any noise. I made it to an intersection that led off in 2 directions, left and right. I chose left and began making my way through the vents again when suddenly I heard a screech below me. \n\nI looked into a crack in the vents and saw a large creature being experimented on. It was a dark red color that had no head but a large mouth where it's stomach should be. It had 2 large fangs that reminded me of those giant spiders and other than that, it had a humanoid shape. I assumed it was about 5 feet tall but it was also pretty wide. \n\nI continued through the vents as I tried to ignore it's screeching. I made my way to a dead end that had a hatch which led down into a room that seemed empty. I felt uneasy but pressed on and dropped down...\n\nTo see 5 armed guards pointing rifles at me.\n\n\"W-Wait don't shoot\"!! I shouted instinctively.\n\nI watched as they moved out of the way as a scientist made her way towards me, looking around as if she was some kind of health inspector.\n\n\"My, My...This place is really bland. I might have to issue a makeover for some of these rooms\". The scientist said, annoyed.\n\n\"Did you plan this\"?! I Said, now even more confused.\n\n\"Well, obviously. Why would we leave any tool that is useful inside a room with a kid? Otherwise, despite your...ignorance of the obvious. You passed\"! She stated, faking excitement.\n\n\"I passed what\"? I said.\n\n\"Well, the director and I don't like sending such young....\"Helpers\" on potentially dangerous missions. We made an exception after seeing you survive all those cryptids in Bristin Forest but we just had to test you to make sure you were ready\". She stated in a matter of fact tone.\n\n\"Your father insisted that he brought you along instead of sending you to an orphanage and that ultimately led to his demise. I'd reckon you don't make the same mistake\". She finished.\n\nI tried to comprehend everything that was happening but she just kept talking. I eventually tuned her out.\n\n\"As you already know..... So you will be assigned for guard duty for the next...... As your second Test....... Your schedule is.......  Oh, and make sure to not open any...... And don't forget to read the rules\" She rambled as I tried my best to tune her out.\n\n\"Uh... Wait- Your making me do some work for you, without pay? Isn't that illegal or something\"? I asked cautiously.\n\n\"You will be being paid about $200 every day as long as you follow the schedule and don't break any rules\". She stated, annoyed that I asked.\n\n\"W-Wait- What am I even guarding\"? I Asked curiously.\n\nShe sighed before speaking, \"Cryptids, those monsters that people don't have evidence on. Some are real but most are fake. We are a facility that contains them and studies  them as well as patrolling any area nearby to prevent any...incidents\". She finished, immediately regretting she told me so much.\n\n\"You are to stay in your room for the rest of the day, your job starts tomorrow\". She stated and began to leave.\n\n\"W-Wait-\" I said but she was already gone.\n\nI was \"Escorted\" by the guards to my \"room\", or what I call, my cell. They forcefully pushed me inside and locked the door. I was trapped...again.\n\nI spent hours just lying in my new bed, growing more bored as the seconds passed. I was going stir crazy when the light in my room started flashing red. The door to my cell unlocked and I quickly ran out to see researchers running away from something in the distance. I could hear gunfire and I was able to catch a glimpse of whatever was causing the commotion, It was the cryptid I saw earlier.\n\nIt immediately sensed me and started running towards my direction. I screamed and ran in the opposite direction. I managed to distance myself and ran into a room, barricading the door and immediately inspected where I was. I saw a giant glass frame that blocked me off from some creature in the corner of the room.\n\n\"Hello\"? I asked, slightly shaking from the stress of the situation.\n\n\"What do you want from me...\"? It asked in a deep voice.\n\n\"Y-You can talk\"?! I asked, clearly shocked.\n\nIt turned around to face me and what I saw shocked me. The cryptid was around 7 feet tall and resembled a bear but was a bit different. It had a large mouth with gaping teeth and it had 4 eyes that looked at my very soul. Its fur was a dark grey and had horns on its head. It walked toward me and I could see its razor-like claws, almost 6 inches long.\n\n\"You do not resemble the scientists...who are you\"? It asked, confused.\n\n\"I-I'm Travis, I was taken here and I don't really work here...yet\". I said and continued.\"What about you? What is your name\"? I asked.\n\n\"I...I do not have a name\". It said.\n\n\"Maybe we can come up with one for you? Any suggestions\"? I asked, trying to be friendly.\n\n\"I always liked the name, Darius\". It said.\n\n\"Alright, Darius\" I said, smiling.\n\nDarius looked at me and sighed.\n\n\"I was captured about a month ago. I was being hunted by a group of humans when I was shocked with a large amount of electricity and incapacitated. I was quickly swarmed by the humans and sent here. Ever since, they asked me tiresome questions and poked and prodded at me. I do not wish to be here.\" He said solemnly.\n\n\"My father had been working for this place and we were both being stalked by some shadows that were giant spiders. I called for help but...I don't think that my father....\" I trailed off, a knot tying into my stomach as I heard a familiar screech as the door and barricade was slammed forward.\n\nI was blasted back by the door that was thrust in my direction and I smashed into the glass, shattering it at a tremendous force. I banged against the wall and fought to not black out. Darius looked in shock at the sudden turn of events but leapt to my defense. The cryptids launched themselves at eachother, both of them sent barreling towards me. I crawled out of the way just in time to dodge being crushed as they clashed. Darius slammed his claw into the cryptids chest as It shrieked in pain and used its mouth on its stomach to bite into his arm. Darius howled in pain but was able to maneuver himself and thrust his arm forward, slicing his claws through the cryptids neck. It let out one last screech as it bled out and died.\n\nHe pushed the now dead cryptid away from him and rushed to my aid.\n\n\"Travis are you-\" He didn't get a chance to finish his sentence as a guard lunged at him from behind, stabbing a needle into his neck. He immediately started wobbling and fell to the ground, unconscious.\n\nI was barely awake as they grabbed me, Darius and the dead cryptid out of the room.\n\n\"Don't...Hurt.....D-Darius\". I tried to say but it came out as a hoarse whisper that nobody heard. I blacked out shortly after...\n\nI woke up back in my cell, Bandages wrapped around my head and the door was locked again. I searched the toybox in a desperate attempt to leave but there was nothing useful inside. I tried everything to leave the cell but they probably won't let me out until tomorrow. It took me ten minutes to make a friend... And only one minute to lose him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I'm writing this as an update to my situation. I'll stay in contact with you all and keep you updated as much as I can. I just hope that Darius is ok...",

        "text": "My invitation to the High Priestess’ sorcerous soiree was rather unexpected, given my anonymity amongst the local undivine community. Had I known beforehand that I’d be invited, I would’ve conducted myself to some far-flung, physically unnavigable realm, wholly relieved from this sphere of mortal existence. But the invitation was received, and thus I was bound to attend—lest my soul be unfastened from my body and thrown heavenward to disintegrate amidst the celestial tumult of the stars. Such are the ways of The Coven.  One cannot deny their whims, no more than one can deny the time-stalling coming of **The Black Horologist.**  \n\nPutting on my best azure robes and selecting my least-used staff, I prepared myself for the party; telling myself—as I brushed the skeletal dust from the fabric and polished the staff-embedded gem—that I’d actually talk to someone this time. My usual behavior at social functions had rarely amounted to much more than standing in a corner muttering anti-social, proximity-buffering incantations to myself. Going alone was the hardest part, not because I wish I had someone with whom to attend the party, but because I’d be *that guy;* and people rarely want to talk to that guy, especially not cute sorceresses or lithe lamia. \n\nAs ready as I could ever be, I drew upon my marmoreal floor a seal of physical transposition, taking careful note of the coven’s ever-roaming domain in my divining orb, lest I accidentally transport myself into a tree, or a cliffside. With the mundane and metaphysical coordinates locked in, I stood in the center of the immaculately drawn sigil with my belongings, and uttered the Atlantean spell that would transport my body and mind across the vast distance. \n\nOne second, I was in my dusty, book-clogged atelier, and the next I was standing in the ruins of an ancient, time-forgotten city in some titanically overgrown forest. Moonlit and ethereal, the derelict metropolis gleamed eerily, and a faint, blue-tinted mist hovered above the dust-capped rubble. Small fires burned intermittently, some having been intentionally placed by the hosts of the party for guidance or subterfuge, others the inexhaustible flames of inter-cosmic serpent-things, who’d come from galaxies unreachably remote in the early years of the primordial earth to lay waste to a sub-race of mankind. Having little use for molten flesh, I avoided these latter fires, though strode confidently and harmlessly through the former.  \n\nPhantoms and specters of long-dead wizards and witches arose around me as I trekked through the cyclopean desolation, calling out promises of power incontestable, or pleading for relief from their irremediable revenancy. I ignored all calls, knowing that in helping them I’d only be damning myself—one way or another. Other things, things that had never been human and would only be so through acts of possession, also whispered or shrieked at me from the deep corners of the murk; and these I ignored as well; knowing –as any warlock should – what eldritch fates could befall those who’re lured by such innominate spirits.  \n\nAll in all, it was standard fair for the occasion. Those who could not resist the calls of the damned and undead rarely made good party guests. The mentally malleable are often poor workers of magic, lacking the skills for any entertaining displays of sorcery. And everyone, from novitiate to incomparably erudite mage is expected to perform at the coven’s parties. Those lost to the lures of seductive shadow and sylvan devilry would not be missed.  \n\nFinally, i made it to the site of the party: a bowl-shaped courtyard of yester-age, suspended upon the open air a few meters from a dead-end in the main road of that half-buried city.  In the early cycles of human civilization, this courtyard had served as a site of congress and discussion amidst the forgotten people’s most learned citizens. But it was now nothing more than another place at which my ilk would engage in revelry and ribaldry.  \n\nThe courtyard, being incredibly spacious and subtly dipped, held a great multitude of people—and other beings who dealt in diablerie and witchcraft. There were even a few clerics and saints, no doubt acting as self-imposed magical wardens, in the event that someone was to conjure or invoke something a little too.... *magically radical.*  \n\nThere were also maddeningly curvaceous incubi and lamia, and it was upon these that I set my sight and heart, for I had long since abandoned any hope of relating with women of my own species. Human women can have hearts crueler and blacker than any demoness; glares more chilling than any boreal witch. They are relentlessly mocking of—and derisive towards—anyone with a propensity for the darker sciences, for spheres of knowledge unconcerned with the atom and the cell. The very arts I had spent my collegiate days learning.  \n\nIn an attempt to seem both casual and mysterious, I put on the face of one who had long ago mastered the lost arcana of pre-human warlocks, and positioned myself near an obelisk of obsidian, upon which were inscribed various sigils denoting certain events within the party. Here, I figured, I’d encounter a decent amount of traffic; hoping that at least a few of the visitors would be buxom, wide-hipped, and blackly souled – the aforementioned lamia and gorgons. I told myself that I’d even settle for a harpy, should one come swooping in my direction.  \n\nBut as the night went on and the black-flamed pyres grew taller, filling the air with sepulchral fumigants and the ghoul-calming odors of the tomb, I realized that no one was bothering to visit the informative slab; that everyone had already been informed of the night’s proceedings through the various scrolls and apparitions that had been their invitations. Yet again, I was the odd sorcerer in the veritable corner: friendless and alone, twiddling his ringed fingers.  \n\nOverhead, the stars danced wildly and intermittently flared in the black gulf, having been reigned by some ostentatiously dressed magician’s ultramundane sorcery. He’d also undoubtedly cast an enchantment upon the Earth's atmosphere itself, so that the stars would appear in their natural arrangement and luminosity to anyone outside the coven’s floating domain.  \n\nIt was flashy, yet magically unimpressive; many a wizard has at some point in his career performed similar feats for the amusement of others – oftentimes children. Still, the attendees seemed enthralled by the cosmic mediocrity, several of the desired demonesses included. Jealous, and openly sour-faced, I left my station at the obelisk and ventured to the bar, where a sanguine-skinned enchantress was serving the acclaimed brews of her coven.  \n\nHere, I quickly lost track of time as I copiously imbibed flagon after flask of blood-spiced wines, of dragon spit shots, and even some allegedly salubrious admixtures of griffin and Pegasus bile. Doubly intoxicated, my mind was quickly and foolishly turned toward the idea of performing some great magical feat of my own, in order to attract the attention—and, ultimately, the men-slaying kisses and caresses—of those serpent-allied women. \n\n Looking around for ideas, I spotted a tarp of greyed giant’s flesh stretched over a broad oaken table, upon which were being sold the polished, begemmed, and gilded skulls of various creatures: some recognizably terrestrial, others the captured and slain fauna of wild planets beyond man's ken. Having just recently mastered the entirety of a spell-tome on Necromancy and Zombology, I figured it would be quite impressive to resurrect from ash and dust the full forms of those cheaply decorated beasts, using only their present vestiges as a basis from which to draw the rest of their anatomy.  \n\nTaking one final shot of a wyrm's amber-coated salivary gland, I strode boldly toward the portly, triply horned merchant; and with funds saved from countless jobs delivering food I bought his entire stock and bid him to depart with his signage.  \n\nI swept away all decorations and embellishments save for the skulls themselves, lest any partiers mistakenly approach me as the stall’s new manager. Next, I cast a simple spell of cleansing, to rid the goods of any diseases or maledictions which might be present. The vendors of such artifacts are rarely concerned with sanitation, given the ephemerality of their merchandise. Finally, I dipped my fingers in a bowl of water which the stall’s former owner had set aside for himself to drink; and traced, wetly, the necromantic sigils of my personal design upon the foreskulls of those yet-to-be-imagined beasts.  \n\nUttering the olden incantations of reanimation, scripted first by primordial warlocks and later refined by scholars of collegiate sorcery, I brought back—one by dreadful one—those furried, scaled, and nearly amorphous horrors.  \n\nMonstrously they rose, snarling, hissing, and sputtering even as they came to form; and the table, under the sudden burden of their still-increasing weight, collapsed onto the stone floor. The commotion brought the attention of a few revelers, who in their wine-addled states mistook the scene as some simple party trick; rather than a dark thaumaturgy. When the first beast had completed its sorcerous reinvention, rising upon its massive hind legs like some maniacal fantasist’s idea of a Lycan, a crowd was present; dimly marveling at the increasingly unsafe scene.  \n\nThe other horrors, comparably atrocious though bearing little or no resemblance to the malformed wolf-thing, came to stand, crouch, or unsteadily wobble at its side. I muttered a command of placidity, all the while knowing that though I may have brought them to life, they would not—and would never—obey me as their master. My enchanting words fell upon willfully deaf or physiologically unhearing ears. The pack of horrors, as varied in their abhorrence as they were deadly in form, crept toward the crowd; who, ignorantly, crept forward in drunken awe.  \n\nTheir mesmerized stupor was wholly broken when a ghouless was lifted and slammed – brutally, callously – to the ground by the ultra-bestial lycanthrope. Her funeral screams of shock and agony were terribly sobering; all in immediate attendance shrank away in terror. Luckily, having just come into existence, the beast’s movements were sluggish, its coordination not yet honed. The woman was dragged away, leaking adipocere and shrieking incoherently, before any further harm could befall her.  \n\nJust when I feared things would end in total failure, and that my bastard creations would not only ruin the party but bring about the end of its guests, a prodigious thing happened. From behind the terror-frenzied crowd came a thunderous sound, as of two great boulders colliding. Many in the crowd fell in the quake of this new marvel, and I finally saw what had caused the noise. The magician, who had earlier dazzled the partiers with his middling astromancy, was in the process of putting together some massive, geologically composed golem. Rock and stone hovered sorcerously, colliding with one another seemingly of their own volition. Soon, a being took form, an entity born of the stones of the courtyard; its composite materials quarried from the floating platform itself.  \n\nMore of a bipedal obelisk than anthropomorphic simulacrum, the thing towered at least fifteen feet above the tallest of guests, with a broadness and stoutness of body that rivaled the most formidable Titans of yore. Its creator, satisfied with the rudimentary image, beckoned it forward; and unlike my drooling, mindless reanimations, it obeyed the commands given to it.  \n\nWith earth-cratering footfalls, it lumbered on, singly driven toward one obvious goal: the extermination of what I'd wrought. Men, lamia, and jesters alike fled before the colossus; while their favors, drinks, and personal belongings were trodden underfoot.  \n\nNot wanting to be associated with the beasts—who bore no familiarity with me, anyhow—I fled toward the bar, which I figured would be the most defensible area of the party. The creatures, primally sensing the threat of the approach golem, hissed and howled vehemently; and the boldest of the assemblage pounced at once.  \n\nLike some back-alley boxer, the colossus threw wide though devastating punches, reducing the creatures to clouds of crimson mist in mid-air. Having not yet developed the necessary intelligence or intuition for self-preservation, the other creatures sprang forward to follow the fates of the vanguard, with sharply poised claws and undulant tentacles. They too were effortlessly stricken down, splattered against pillars, floor, and brazier like anointing oil.  \n\nThe fight—if you could call that one-sided slaughter such a thing—ended with the collapse of the Lycan-thing's skull beneath the golem’s boulder of a heel. Waves of relief and elation swept through the party, and applause—of which I was shamelessly a part— erupted in celebration of the magician who’d saved us. And even better, it seemed that no one attributed the bestial nightmares to me. In their drunkenness they must’ve thought the things to have been born of some errant, master-less force of maleficent magic.  \n\nAll seemed well, until the titanic rock-form turned and, with no prompting from its master, slammed an unsuspecting Atlantean into the ground. There was no scream, he hadn’t the time to. His body was instantly pulverized, reduced to frothing green pulp atop the flagstones. Black ichor pooled into the cracks, streaming over the feet of people nearby. Silence befell the congregation, and then a rapturous tumult of multilingual terror broke it.  \n\nWith the same brutal efficiency it had demonstrated against my beasts, the golem began demolishing the partiers. The more sober of them pleaded with the magician to control or dismantle his creation, but despite various hastily incanted malenchantments and utterances, the magician could not stall or unmake his murdering creation.  \n\nThrough this latest hysteria I tracked the golem’s cumbersome approach toward a group of women, a group which included the achingly beautiful lamia I’d seen earlier in the party. My feelings swelled, seeing her so pitiably helpless, and I knew that regardless of my own fate, I had to stop this new nightmare from reaching her.  \n\nSurveying the scene, I realized that I wouldn’t be able to cross the great courtyard in time, and that in any case the still-fleeing partiers would only impede my progress. We were hemmed in by nothingness, closed off from escape by a sheer fall from the platform’s precipitous edge.  \n\nDesperation bred a moment of clarity, and the subsequent revelation did not send me cowering back behind the bar, praying for some Providential intervention. Instead, I was granted the peace of mind necessary to perform the grave, self-sacrificing task.  \n\nFirst, I cast a simple—though incredibly arcane—spell of fortification. Using my own life-force, I projected a magical armor onto all in attendance, which would for a few moments’ time render them completely invulnerable to magical damage. It would not save them from the crushing blows of the megalithic colossus, as it was a physical construct – despite its magical origins.  \n\nA side-effect of this enchantment is that those protected by it are also rendered immobile, which must’ve been a supremely unsettling sensation, given that many were only a few paces away from their golemesque pursuer. But before it could pummel those nearest to it, I performed the second feat of my plan: raising my left hand to the dark, star-scattered sky, I spoke the word, “Bolide”, and made the accompanying gesture of incendiary spellcraft. My hand was at once set aflame, the rings thereon melting and fusing to the bones of my fingers; but I held the gesture and used the blazing appendage to guide my sidereal conjuration through the heavens.  \n\nPerhaps thinking themselves the unluckiest partygoers in the world, the men and women’s screams mounted and then transformed to insensate babbling as they watched one of the stars gain a sudden trajectory toward Earth. Meteorically, the star plummeted landward, trailing stellar plumes in its wake. Only the golem, not graced with a neck, failed to heed the descending celestial object.  \n\nFinally, I used my undamaged hand to grant myself the same protection I’d granted to the others. As I was shielded by the magic, so too was I frozen by it. Just when the golem was about to smash to bits the fair group of gorgons and demonesses, the star struck the courtyard.  \n\nI cannot accurately describe the experience, the annihilating stellar violence. It was as if for a brief, blinding moment I stood on the surface of the sun, immersed in its ultra-radiant splendor. There was no heat, no pain, only light and force and cosmic brilliance.  \n\nWhen my regular vision was returned to me, I saw only the blasted surface of the courtyard and the petrified guests. Everything inorganic that had been on the subtly bowled surface was gone. I’d known from the beginning of my plan that the integrity of the platform itself would not be compromised. The High Priestess’ magic was much stronger than my own, and she'd endowed the site with a plentiful supply of it in anticipation of most magical potentialities.  \n\nMy magic subsided a moment later, and we were all relieved of our immobility. My hand –charred to the bone – cooled as rapidly as the flames that once coated it had grown, leaving a cold black claw. I would’ve probably found someplace to rest, then; but a Satyr, cloaked in the garb of some unfamiliar occult order, helped me to my feet and bore me forward. In the bleating tones of its kind, it announced that I was the one who saved us—that my miraculous spellcasting had destroyed the foolish magician’s rampaging construct.  \n\nThe crowd applauded again, only with much greater fervor this time. With my unburnt hand I waved in acceptance of their gratitude. The inhuman women for whom I had pined came over and helped the satyr carry me to a slab of rock – the only elevated spot of the star-blasted site. Here I was gifted with the magical ephemerae of conjurers and arcanists. And while these were accepted with much appreciation and humility, it was the kiss of a particular lamia that sent my heart fluttering, and my mind reeling with joy.  \n\nWhat a night.",

        "text": "  \n\nI knew where the skull was buried. The body, no, but I didn’t need the body. I just needed the skull; the rest might regenerate. \n\nMy friend, John, had long ago moved out of the house. I hadn’t been back to the old neighborhood in twenty years. A new family lived there. A multi-level house with brick and green faded siding. In the back of that yard was buried a woman’s head. John said one day a man had knocked on his door. He had a long beard and a bald head. He had a burlap bag and in that bag was a woman’s head. He didn’t reveal that. He never told them anything about the contents of the bag. He said he had a briefcase of money, and he convinced the family that if they let him bury his belongings, he would give them a hundred thousand dollars in two years’ time. He said he would be back to collect and to reward. Now any other family would have refused or called the police, but John’s parents were, let’s just say, stupid as shit, desperate folks. They spent their weekly checks on everything but necessities. Every other month their lights were shut off. They had numerous candles in every room of the house. They lived like bats. I couldn’t understand their mentality. According to my dad, buying ten cent gum was considered too expensive. \n\nThe man walked to the back yard, dug a hole, and plopped the bag in the ground. John’s parents really didn’t think much of it. The man warned them, harshly.\n\n“Now you’ll get your money. In the meantime, don’t unbury that bag or you’ll regret it.” The man, casually dressed, nothing spectacular about his appearance, walked out the door, never to be seen again. Five years down the road, John’s family would lose the house, auctioned off to the highest bidder.  \n\nJohn told me and my other friend Mike this story one day in the cafeteria, but John told a lot of stories. He was a cool guy but prone to spouting off a whole lot of horse shit. \n\n“Your parents agreed to this?” I asked. \n\n“Well yeah. I know it's crazy but that’s a lot of money.”\n\nMike laughed, “Bullshit.”\n\n“I’m serious dude. Why would I lie about it?”\n\n“How long ago was this.”\n\n“More than a year. I was too scared to say anything.”\n\n“Well,” Mike intervened, “there’s only one thing to do. We got to prove you ain’t full of shit. We got to dig up that bag.”\n\n“No man. He said we would regret it if we dug up that bag. He could be the Mafia or something.”\n\nI liked the idea, especially if it meant exposing one of John’s extravagant tales. Maybe he would stop telling them if we just embarrassed him a little bit. “I like it. Mike’s right. Let’s do this. We’ll spend the night, get some pizza, play some video games, and early in the morning we’ll dig up that bag.”\n\n“Jay, I’m not lying, but if you really want to do this what can it hurt. We’ll dig it up and then put it right back in the hole and rebury it.”\n\nThat night we had fun. John’s parents had paid the electric bill so we could watch some rented movies and play some video games. We had walked to the video rental store and on the way back stopped off and got two pizzas. I was the only one anywhere near driving. I had my learner’s permit, but Mike had failed on his first try and John had never even attempted. He was a teenager but acted like a child. \n\nAbout five in the morning, I started to doze off. My eyes were heavy, and I was ready for sleep. I really had forgotten all about the bag. Mike punched me in the shoulder. \n\n“Come on, let’s go. It’s time.” Mike had a shovel in his hand and John was standing next to him. \n\nWe walked out to the backyard. John said that the man had buried the bag near the oak tree.\n\nMike dropped the point of the shovel to the ground and hopped on it with two feet, pushing it easily into the dirt. He dug until he saw a piece of twine. \n\n“Well, I’ll be damned. There’s something buried alright. Let’s hope it’s some diamonds.”\n\nHe dug further out from the twine, not wanting to hit the bag and damage its contents. After some time, we could see that it was indeed a burlap bag. My heart rate began to increase. I thought that maybe it might not be a good idea to lift this bag out of the ground. Mike had exposed enough of the bag to be able to pull it out without ripping it. There was a bulge in the bag. It didn’t look like there were a collection of little things, like diamonds and gold coins, just one big lump. Mike untied the twine and turned the bag upside down. There was a thump. On the ground was a severed head, a woman with blond hair, green eyes, and sharp serrated teeth. The neck was neatly cauterized. She was beautiful and frightening. \n\n“Holy shit! What the fuck!” Mike exclaimed. \n\nShe blinked and we ran like hell back into the house. \n\n“Well so much for diamonds,” I said. \n\n“Did she blink? Is that thing somehow alive? We got to put it back in the ground.”\n\n“No John, we don’t. You do. You live here. We don’t.”\n\n“Dude, it was your idea to dig it up. I told you I wasn’t lying. We can’t just leave it there.”\n\nI ran back out the door, tired of hearing the bickering. I took the shovel and pushed the head back into the hole. The head snapped at the end of the shovel as it fell into the hole, eyes staring upward at me, green moist eyes, eyes you would see on a living head attached to a living body, not dead and fading like a corpse. I lost my nerve and threw the burlap bag over the hole. At least the neighbors wouldn’t see it. I ran back into the house. \n\n“Why didn’t you bury it?” \n\n“Fuck you John, I did my part.”\n\nLuckily for us we could procrastinate. Both John’s parents worked on Saturdays, his mom for the department store and his dad cooking for a fast-food joint. I went back home for a while and hung out in my room. Mike had a baseball game that day. He said that we would meet back up that afternoon and fill in the hole and be down with the whole affair. \n\nDid I really want to go back? Hell no, but then again, I didn’t want to let John down. I felt responsible. I fell asleep for a while but when I woke up, I just laid there thinking, eyes closed, half-awake and half-asleep. I envisioned a beautiful demoness with blond hair walking toward me, dressed in white lace, baring her teeth, I hypnotized by her emerald eyes, pliant and ready to be devoured. I owed it to John. We convinced him to dig it up. I was at least going to help him in that regard, but I was convinced that after that I would never go back to his house ever again. \n\nJohn’s parents weren’t home yet. John was sitting on the front porch as Mike and I approached. \n\n“Did you win?” he asked. \n\n“Hell no, we got blasted. 10-2.”\n\n“Shit you guys suck.” Mike punched me in the shoulder. That was his go-to move. \n\n“You been out here all day.”\n\n“Hell yeah. I just got back from walking through the neighborhood. I’m tired, but I ain’t going to be able to sleep until we got that thing buried.”\n\nWe walked downstairs and to the basement. Mike grabbed the shovel from the rack. I opened the back door and stopped. John bumped into me. \n\n“What the hell man?”\n\nI moved out of the doorway and pointed to where the head was. The head was still there but it wasn’t isolated. The neck and chest had grown, her exposed breasts out in the afternoon sun for all to see. Her right arm was tissue and muscle to the elbow, her left arm only bone from the shoulder to her wrist. It was an asymmetrical regeneration, fascinating, nonetheless. Her neck was askew, being that her head was still in the hole. The bag still over her face. She was still an embryo, arms unfunctional and unable to move the burlap blindfold from her gaze. Mike moved toward her. We followed behind. I was curious as to what he was going to do. He took the shovel and moved the bag off of her face. Her face was pushed up against the side of the hole, planted into the dirt. She couldn’t turn her head. Mike walked behind the hole and grabbed her long blonde hair. \n\n“What the fuck man?” I yelled. \n\n“I want to see if she can talk.”\n\nHe grabbed a tuft of hair and pulled upward and to the side of the hole. He dropped her head onto the ground. She looked around at everyone and then set her gaze upon me, never looking anywhere else but at me. \n\n“Can you talk? What’s your name? Damn, I think she likes you.”\n\n“She’s dumb as shit. She’s not going to talk. John, what about the shed?” Mike asked. \n\n“Yeah, my dad doesn’t ever use it anymore.”\n\n“Good, help me.” Mike grabbed her by the hair and started dragging her toward the shed. She started squawking like a hawk. “Can you guys help me for Christ’s sake?”\n\n“How? What do we grab? Her tits?” John answered. She never stopped staring at me, even though she was struggling and making unbearable noises. Mike finally got her into the shed. \n\n“What do we do now? I can’t have a torso living in my shed?”\n\n“We chop her damn head off, put it back in that bag, and bury it. And never mention it again.”\n\n“We can’t do that. She’s alive. That would be murder,” I responded. \n\n“Oh shit, Jay is in love. That’s not a human. Nice tits, but have you seen the teeth? You are out of your mind.”\n\n“Ok then Mike, there’s a saw in the basement. Go chop her fucking head off then.” I was getting irritated. I knew it was a monster, but I knew it was something else as well. Maybe it was human at one time, maybe she could be human again. \n\nBefore I could say anything else she lunged at Mike and bit him in the neck. She was latched in deep, her chest heaving up and down, as if she was sucking the life force out of his body. Mike yelled in pain. \n\n“Get this bitch off me!” John grabbed her by the hair, and I tried to grab her arm, which was only bone. As I grabbed ahold of her wrist, the bony arm was wrenched from her shoulder, and I was tossed back against the wall of the shed. She finally loosened her grip and John was able to pull her to the ground. Mike was bleeding out fast but was too furious to care. He stomped out of the shed and within a couple of minutes he came back with an axe. He swung it high above his head and down into her shoulder blade, missing her neck and showering us and the shed interior with blood. She went to move again, and John yanked hard on her hair, pulling her head far back, exposing a wide swath of neck. Mike landed a clean shot in the middle of her neck, pushing her head into the floor, and deep into her esophagus. She tried to scream, blood bubbling up and streaming out through the open gash. Mike freed the axe and hammered down again with a heavy blow. That did it. He was a power hitter in baseball, batting fourth, striking out most of the time, but every now and then he would get a hold of one and send it to the clouds. The head was, for all intents and purposes, once again, severed. There was some stubborn flesh and muscle to cut away, but after that the body and head would be torn away permanently. \n\nMike went and got the burlap bag. He grabbed the head by the hair and lifted it up in the air. For a moment, I thought of Medusa and Perseus. \n\n“Get the bag and open it wide.” I went and grabbed the bag and did as he requested. She ogled me again with her gaze, as if pleading not to be imprisoned, as if I was the only one who had the power to free her. Although it was a pleading look, I also felt like she genuinely liked me. It seemed to be an endearing stare. \n\nMike dropped her head in, tied the bag, and put it back in its grave, never to be exhumed ever again.  We covered up the torso in the shed with a tarp. I helped John clean the shed with some bleach, but Mike was done. He was exhausted from all the physical exertion and loss of blood. John gave him a towel to hold against his neck. Of course, John’s parents didn’t have any bandages or anything. \n\nMike told his parents that he had been bitten by a dog. I never went back to John’s house, but he would hang out at my house. It wasn’t too long after that affair that John and his family were evicted, and the house went into foreclosure. He moved away and I never talked or seen him again. I guess he took care of the body. I don’t know. I eventually went off to college, got my degree, and then got married. It wasn’t happily ever after. My wife left me after two years. I’ve never really been outgoing. I never dated in high school, and I’ve only had a few relationships. I’ve been really lonely here lately and for the first time in a long time I got to thinking about the woman, or at least her head and her beautiful green eyes. I couldn’t resist wondering how she would look if she was a fully developed human being… and I truly think she took a shine to me.",

        "text": "To those of you who missed my last post, my son, Jake, owed money to some depraved crooks. A loan shark named Warren attempted to slaughter my family, but my late wife, Anna — whose spectral form is lovingly woven into the very fabric of our house — [ensured that Warren paid the price](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ljubf/my_dead_wife_lives_in_the_walls_of_our_house/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).\n\nBut the disreputable deviant didn’t act alone, and I knew that it was only a matter of time before his colleagues came looking for him.\n\nThis evening, they found us, and I endured horror beyond belief. I feel I can only process these events by writing them down. Some of you may not understand that, but I hope you do when you reach the end of this post.\n\n“Dad,” Cassie cried.\n\nI frantically flicked the switch on my lamp to see my twelve-year-old daughter quivering in my bedroom doorway. Her face was strewn with tears, and she was clutching the fabric of her pink pyjamas.\n\n“What’s wrong, Cass?” I asked, my heart pounding.\n\n“I went downstairs for a drink. There’s… somebody at the window.”\n\nI squinted at the alarm clock on my bedside table. It was a little after midnight. I hurriedly slid out of bed, slipped into a pair of joggers, and threw on a T-shirt. I seized the only blunt instrument that would suffice as a weapon — a tall, slender, empty vase.\n\n“I want you to go to Jake’s room and hide with him,” I told Cassie.\n\nShe nodded her head and tiptoed across the darkened landing. I followed her and waited at the top of the stairs until I was sure she was in Jake’s room. Creeping quietly downstairs, I listened for any sounds of intrusion. Nothing. The house was eerily silent.\n\nI peered through window panes as I made my way through the house. As I passed the utility room, I caught a fleeting glimpse of a black shape in the narrow passage beside my house. I sank my upper teeth into my lip, fervently trying to prevent myself from screaming. I had never been so afraid — not even on the night of Warren Jones’ attack — but that would change before the evening was over.\n\nI was so distracted by whatever I had seen through the window of the back door that I barely noticed I’d strolled into the kitchen. As I twisted my head to face the windows, which overlooked the garden, my vocal cords finally assumed control. I screeched in terror.\n\nStanding outside my kitchen window were three cloaked figures. Black robes shrouded their bodies, and they wore frightful, featureless, grey masks. The still men were illuminated by a row of solar-powered lights in the garden. Upon seeing me, however, one of the three men turned around and proceeded to stamp vehemently on each of the lights in the dirt.\n\nAs each light extinguished, the masked menaces slipped deeper and deeper into the darkness. And when the last solar light was broken, I could no longer see them at all. I raced for the kitchen light switch. Obviously, that did very little to help — if anything, it simply gave away my position. Some light poured through the window into the garden, however, and I was horrified to see that the three masked men were gone.\n\nAnd then I heard a creak from the utility room. The back door had been opened. I’ve no idea how they unlocked it so stealthily, but I was preoccupied with the pitter-patter of footsteps throughout my house — some of them were heading upstairs. I prayed that my children were well-hidden.\n\nWhistling sounded throughout our home. The terrifying, tone-deaf tune was *Money* by Pink Floyd. I clutched my weapon so tightly that my fingers turned white. Every time I entered a room, floorboards thudded under the weight of shadowy figures slinking away. The masked men kept turning off the lights, so I accepted the darkness.\n\nAnd then the soundlessness was disrupted by screaming.\n\nI heard rapid footsteps coming down the stairs, followed by laughter. I darted into the lobby and finally found myself facing the intruders. One of them was leading my son downstairs with a knife to his throat. The other two emerged from the kitchen, joining us in the lobby. Cassie was nowhere to be seen. They hadn’t found her.\n\n“I’m sorry, Dad,” Jake cried. “This is all my fault.”\n\n“I’m sorry, Dad,” The man with the knife mocked, imitating my son’s terrified voice.\n\n“Quiet, Johnny,” Said another of the men, as he removed his mask. “Hello, Simon Grant. My name’s Frankie, and I’m here because I seem to have misplaced my employee — and a *fuck-tonne* of money, for that matter.”\n\n“Please let my son go,” I pleaded, placing my weapon on the ground. “I can easily get the two grand.”\n\n”Is that what you told Warren?” Frankie asked. “Where is Mr Jones, Simon? Let’s give him a ring and see, shall we?”\n\nMy son and I exchanged fearful glances as Frankie produced a phone from a pocket in his cloak and quickly dialled a number. Jake and I knew what was going to happen. A ringtone ricocheted off the walls of our house — it was muffled by the spider plant limbs that were coating most of the floorboards and walls in my home.\n\n“Search for that phone, Mike,” Frankie ordered the third man. “It’s got to be somewhere in this overgrown hellhole. What the *fuck* happened here, Simon? You don’t look like a man who has two grand knocking about.”\n\n“This place isn’t what it seems,” I warned. “You should leave.”\n\nFrankie laughed. “You’re not in any position to threaten me, Simon.”\n\n“It wasn’t a threat,” I said. “I’m begging you.”\n\n“Boss,” Mike said, emerging from Anna’s study with a phone in his hand. “I found it. No sign of Warren though — just this fucking plant that’s… everywhere.”\n\n“Mind explaining why you’ve got my employee’s phone, Mr Grant?” Frankie asked. “You think you were begging a moment ago? Let me give you an opportunity to *really* beg.”\n\nSuddenly, with a slight head-nod from Frankie, Johnny kicked Jake to his knees. Before I could reach my son, Mike knocked me to the floor and pinned me down.\n\n“I want you to watch this, Simon,” Frankie said. “This is what happens when I don’t get what I want.”\n\nFrankie wrapped his gloved fingers around Jake’s arm, and my son squirmed as the boss produced a knife from his pocket.\n\n“Please…” I bawled, wrestling with Mike. “Anna, help us…”\n\nFrankie plunged the blade into Jake’s wrist, slowly and surely severing his hand from his arm. My son screamed as the malevolent man hacked away, and I joined him with my own yelps of horror. The spider plant’s leaves started to move, but not quickly enough. Frankie, hacking away with a butcher’s knife, made quick work of removing Jake’s hand. And it wasn’t until he finished that he noticed the tightening leaves around his legs.\n\n“What the… What the fuck?” Frankie cried, stepping back from my boy.\n\n“Boss…” Mike gasped.\n\nI seized the opportunity to throw the distracted grunt off my back, and I ran over to my son, whose body was jittering uncontrollably. He was in shock, and we both attempted to stem the bleeding from his handless wrist. Everybody watched Frankie meet the same fate as Warren. Leafy tentacles oozed from his orifices, consuming his body.\n\n“Fuck this!” Johnny barked, backing away.\n\nThe henchman bumped into a family portrait hanging on our wall, and something amazing happened — amazing, but ghastly. My wife, the miniature figure in the photograph, seized Johnny — her tiny hands wrapped around his throat and pulled him backwards.\n\nScreeching, the man disappeared into the frame, and I watched as the phantom photograph moved — my wife strangled the man until he lay limp, and then she dragged him out of view. My children and I remained static in the photograph, oblivious to the terrifying events unfolding around us.\n\n“No… I’m not dying here…” Mike, the final intruder, shrieked.\n\nHe turned on his heel and ran to the front door, but as he placed his hands on the woodwork, something inexplicable happened. He began to melt into the wood — he hands liquified, as did his arms, and then his body.\n\n“Stop it!” Mike screamed, vanishing into the door. “Make it…”\n\nHe trailed off as his body melded with the house. But I didn’t care — I was fixated on my son’s body, lying lifelessly in my arms. That was the only thing which terrified me. Cassie crept downstairs as I dialled 999, and we rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.\n\nDue to massive blood loss, my son slipped into a coma. I don’t know whether he’s going to make it. But I’m typing this post because my daughter and I witnessed one final spectacle of simultaneous beauty and terror.\n\n“Look, Dad,” Cassie whispered, pointing at a vase of flowers on the windowsill of the hospital room.\n\nPeonies. Anna’s favourite. And the way the night breeze caught the perfectly-pink bulbs, the flowers seemed to take the form of a woman holding the hand of a young boy — no, a young *man*. It was undoubtedly Anna and Jake.\n\nThe billowing wind danced across the room, carrying wispy words to Cassie and me.\n\n“Jake’s safe,” Anna whispered. “I’m trying to wake him up.”\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "I found the girl’s bones in the house, tucked inside the attic.\n\nThey had been picked clean and were colored stone gray. The only flesh that remained on her skeleton was the skin stretched taut across her skull. It cradled her eyes precariously in their sockets, and I watched as a spider wove delicate webs on her irises.\n\nHer spine had been dislodged and splayed apart. They looked like the desiccated wings of an angel who had tried to fly but ultimately had failed.\n\nSomething glinted in the faint light. A thin gold bracelet encircled the delicate bones of her wrist.\n\nAllegra, it read in fancy script. Allegra. I knew her. I had known her. She was older than me, so I hadn’t known her well. We didn’t hang out with the same group of friends. But I knew her sister, Cora, and I knew that since the two weeks Allegra had been missing, Cora and her family had been looking for her.\n\nEveryone spoke about her as though she were dead. Then they talked in hushed tones about how lovely she had been.\n\nAnd I had found her.\n\nThis house wasn’t haunted; it was infested. There were spider webs everywhere, and I could hear scratching in the walls and the sound of many things crawling.\n\nI was trapped here. They had trapped me in here. They called themselves my friends, but what friends ensured that when they pricked you, they nicked a vein to watch you bleed out.\n\nI heard them laughing from behind the door. Their voices mimicked every sound I made.\n\n“Help meee,” Kat wailed.\n\n“Save meee,” Ira cackled.\n\nI tried to tell them about Allegra’s body, but they just mocked me. They refused to hear me.\n\nThere was a soft clicking noise, and rustling came from the dry corpse of my friend’s dead sister. I watched in wonder as her jaw worked and opened. A wave of spiders crawled out, and so did her voice.\n\n“Help me,” she said. Her voice was so soft. Her withered lips stretched over her teeth and ripped. It sounded just like paper.\n\n“Help me,” she repeated. “Helpmehelpmehelpmehelpmehelpme…Help me.”\n\nHer eyes rolled towards me, the spider‘s web clouding them. I knew she saw me because I had been the one to find her. We had found one another.\n\n“Help you?” Allegra whispered, her neck cracking as she whipped her head to look at me. She held out a bony finger and swiped at my eyes. My tears glistened on the dirty gray appendage. They looked like crystals.\n\n“Help you?” Allegra said again. She coughed and brought forth another cascade of bugs.\n\nThey crawled towards me and climbed up my arm; others crept into the crevices of my eyes.\n\nI screamed so loud that my throat felt like it was being ripped apart.\n\nI threw myself at the door, clawing until the quicks under my nails bled.\n\n“I can help you,” a voice said behind me gently. “I can help you. “\n\nI screamed and banged on the door. “Help me!”\n\nTo my relief, the knob rattled, and then there were heavy thumps. They were trying to kick it in.\n\n“Stand back!” A voice, Ira, yelled. There was a pause, and with a resounding boom, the door popped open.\n\nI rushed out of the room and crashed into Kat and Ira.\n\n“Farrah?” Kat gasped. She looked beyond me into the room and screamed. I ran, and I kept running. Kat kept screaming.\nI ran down the hallway and nearly fell down the stairs. Ira was right behind me; her eyes were wide with shock. Kat was nowhere to be seen.\nWe opened the door and flung ourselves into the sunlight. I don’t remember much else that day, but we must have gone for help.\n\nThe police never found Kat or Allegra, and I knew they hadn’t tried very hard.  I doubt if they even entered the house.\n\nWe sought adventure, and what we got in return was a lifetime of regret and grief.\n\nIt’s been calling me for a while. That thing inside the house. I hear it whispering to me, and I can feel Allegra’s bones tracing the lines on my face.\n\nI can help you, that voice had said. I can help you.\n\nNothing has helped me since. I dream of Kat every night, and in my dreams, she takes hold of my fingers and breaks them apart with her teeth.\n\n“It should have been you,” she hisses at me through blood and bone. “Why didn’t you die instead?” \nIf I had an answer, I would tell her, but I don’t.\n\nI’m going to go back. I’m going to open the door and climb the stairs. I will take what was mine from the beginning, and maybe Kat will stop cursing me in my dreams.\n\nAnd if she doesn’t, that’s fine because I will find solace amongst the dead and their bones. Maybe if I unravel the spider web, I can learn its secrets, and in return, I’ll be able to help those who seek it. I will be the one spoken of in hushed tones.",

        "text": "I am a 17 year old boy that lives in a small suburban area. My parents are now on day 4 of their 7 day cruise. I finally convinced them to let me stay home alone without any supervision. Now I am regretting it. \n\nIt all started the day before my parents departure. I kept hearing footsteps above me even though we live in a one story home. My mom kept trying to convince me that it was just the house creaking but for some reason I had this unsettling feeling that there was actually something up there. After hours of convincing, my mom finally agreed to call pest control to come and see if there was any traces of rodents/pests trapped in our attic. \n\nThe pest control arrived later that afternoon to check the attic. They didn't find anything out of the ordinary but said that they would bomb the attic as a precautionary. We had to leave the house for an hour, which was fine with me considering it would give me peace of mind. \n\nWe got back to the house about an hour and a half later to a note on the counter saying that the attic was bombed and that we shouldn't have any more problems in the near future. That night I slept peacefully. The next morning my parents left for their cruise leaving me home alone. \n\nNight 1:\nI was in my room playing video games, when I heard the footsteps again. It was brief, but I know what I heard. I convinced myself that maybe it was whatever rodent up there dying out and that I should just forget about it. So I did and the rest of the night was quiet. \n\nNight 2: \nI left the hall light on, closed and locked my bedroom door, and began to try to fall asleep. I have to say it was pretty weird being in the house totally alone, especially because of how quiet our neighborhood is at night. As I was falling asleep, I heard something that made me sit up in my bed. At that moment as I looked toward the light through the bottom of my door, I saw a shadow pass by. I shot up out of my bed to ensure that I had locked my door. Thankfully I did. I tip toed back to my bed and sat there waiting for some sort of sound to emerge. That was when I heard our refrigerator door open and gently close. I knew it was the fridge because my room is right next to the kitchen and I've heard this noise plenty of times. At this point I felt helpless. So of course, I called the cops. After 30 minutes of waiting they finally arrived. They searched the house and found nothing. They said there was no signs of forced entry and that I was probably just on edge since it was my first time staying alone. After they left I knew something still didn't feel right. I barely slept that night. \n\nNight 3: \nIt was about 11 pm and I felt exhausted considering I had only gotten a few hours of sleep the previous night. I fell asleep without any problems. I woke up a few hours later with the feeling that I was being watched. I jumped out of my sleep and turned on my table lamp. Everything looked just as it did when I went to bed. I fell back to asleep but this time with the lamp on. \n\nDay 4: \nThe next morning I woke up and got ready for school. As I went to leave my room I noticed the door was unlocked. Now when I tell you that even though I was exhausted I know for a fact that I triple checked the lock on my bedroom door before I went to bed... I think someone watched me sleep. \n\nWhen I got home from school that day, there was several police cars on my street. Which was rare, because as I mentioned before I live in a small suburban area. I asked one of my neighbors who was standing outside if she knew what was going on. She said that someone discovered two bodies in the woods behind our neighborhood. She said, and that's when my whole body went numb, that it was two employees from the local pest control company. \n\nI am now at my aunt and uncles, which is about 2 hours away from home. I am not sure what to make of all that has happened. But I do know that someone is living in my attic.",

A loan shark named Warren attempted to slaughter my family, but my late wife, Anna — whose spectral form is lovingly woven into the very fabric of our house — [ensured that Warren paid the price]([https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ljubf/my\\_dead\\_wife\\_lives\\_in\\_the\\_walls\\_of\\_our\\_house/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ljubf/my_dead_wife_lives_in_the_walls_of_our_house/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)).\n\nBut the disreputable deviant didn’t act alone, and I knew that it was only a matter of time before his colleagues came looking for him.\n\nThis evening, they found us, and I endured horror beyond belief. I feel I can only process these events by writing them down. Some of you may not understand that, but I hope you do when you reach the end of this post.\n\n“Dad,” Cassie cried.\n\nI frantically flicked the switch on my lamp to see my twelve-year-old daughter quivering in my bedroom doorway. Her face was strewn with tears, and she was clutching the fabric of her pink pyjamas.\n\n“What’s wrong, Cass?” I asked, my heart pounding.\n\n“I went downstairs for a drink. There’s… somebody at the window.”\n\nI squinted at the alarm clock on my bedside table. It was a little after midnight. I hurriedly slid out of bed, slipped into a pair of joggers, and threw on a T-shirt. I seized the only blunt instrument that would suffice as a weapon — a tall, slender, empty vase.\n\n“I want you to go to Jake’s room and hide with him,” I told Cassie.\n\nShe nodded her head and tiptoed across the darkened landing. I followed her and waited at the top of the stairs until I was sure she was in Jake’s room. Creeping quietly downstairs, I listened for any sounds of intrusion. Nothing. The house was eerily silent.\n\nI peered through window panes as I made my way through the house. As I passed the utility room, I caught a fleeting glimpse of a black shape in the narrow passage beside my house. I sank my upper teeth into my lip, fervently trying to prevent myself from screaming. I had never been so afraid — not even on the night of Warren Jones’ attack — but that would change before the evening was over.\n\nI was so distracted by whatever I had seen through the window of the back door that I barely noticed I’d strolled into the kitchen. As I twisted my head to face the windows, which overlooked the garden, my vocal cords finally assumed control. I screeched in terror.\n\nStanding outside my kitchen window were three cloaked figures. Black robes shrouded their bodies, and they wore frightful, featureless, grey masks. The still men were illuminated by a row of solar-powered lights in the garden. Upon seeing me, however, one of the three men turned around and proceeded to stamp vehemently on each of the lights in the dirt.\n\nAs each light extinguished, the masked menaces slipped deeper and deeper into the darkness. And when the last solar light was broken, I could no longer see them at all. I raced for the kitchen light switch. Obviously, that did very little to help — if anything, it simply gave away my position. Some light poured through the window into the garden, however, and I was horrified to see that the three masked men were gone.\n\nAnd then I heard a creak from the utility room. The back door had been opened. I’ve no idea how they unlocked it so stealthily, but I was preoccupied with the pitter-patter of footsteps throughout my house — some of them were heading upstairs. I prayed that my children were well-hidden.\n\nWhistling sounded throughout our home. The terrifying, tone-deaf tune was *Money* by Pink Floyd. I clutched my weapon so tightly that my fingers turned white. Every time I entered a room, floorboards thudded under the weight of shadowy figures slinking away. The masked men kept turning off the lights, so I accepted the darkness.\n\nAnd then the soundlessness was disrupted by screaming.\n\nI heard rapid footsteps coming down the stairs, followed by laughter. I darted into the lobby and finally found myself facing the intruders. One of them was leading my son downstairs with a knife to his throat. The other two emerged from the kitchen, joining us in the lobby. Cassie was nowhere to be seen. They hadn’t found her.\n\n“I’m sorry, Dad,” Jake cried. “This is all my fault.”\n\n“I’m sorry, Dad,” The man with the knife mocked, imitating my son’s terrified voice.\n\n“Quiet, Johnny,” Said another of the men, as he removed his mask. “Hello, Simon Grant. My name’s Frankie, and I’m here because I seem to have misplaced my employee — and a *fuck-tonne* of money, for that matter.”\n\n“Please let my son go,” I pleaded, placing my weapon on the ground. “I can easily get the two grand.”\n\n”Is that what you told Warren?” Frankie asked. “Where is Mr Jones, Simon? Let’s give him a ring and see, shall we?”\n\nMy son and I exchanged fearful glances as Frankie produced a phone from a pocket in his cloak and quickly dialled a number. Jake and I knew what was going to happen. A ringtone ricocheted off the walls of our house — it was muffled by the spider plant limbs that were coating most of the floorboards and walls in my home.\n\n“Search for that phone, Mike,” Frankie ordered the third man. “It’s got to be somewhere in this overgrown hellhole. What the *fuck* happened here, Simon? You don’t look like a man who has two grand knocking about.”\n\n“This place isn’t what it seems,” I warned. “You should leave.”\n\nFrankie laughed. “You’re not in any position to threaten me, Simon.”\n\n“It wasn’t a threat,” I said. “I’m begging you.”\n\n“Boss,” Mike said, emerging from Anna’s study with a phone in his hand. “I found it. No sign of Warren though — just this fucking plant that’s… everywhere.”\n\n“Mind explaining why you’ve got my employee’s phone, Mr Grant?” Frankie asked. “You think you were begging a moment ago? Let me give you an opportunity to *really* beg.”\n\nSuddenly, with a slight head-nod from Frankie, Johnny kicked Jake to his knees. Before I could reach my son, Mike knocked me to the floor and pinned me down.\n\n“I want you to watch this, Simon,” Frankie said. “This is what happens when I don’t get what I want.”\n\nFrankie wrapped his gloved fingers around Jake’s arm, and my son squirmed as the boss produced a knife from his pocket.\n\n“Please…” I bawled, wrestling with Mike. “Anna, help us…”\n\nFrankie plunged the blade into Jake’s wrist, slowly and surely severing his hand from his arm. My son screamed as the malevolent man hacked away, and I joined him with my own yelps of horror. The spider plant’s leaves started to move, but not quickly enough. Frankie, hacking away with a butcher’s knife, made quick work of removing Jake’s hand. And it wasn’t until he finished that he noticed the tightening leaves around his legs.\n\n“What the… What the fuck?” Frankie cried, stepping back from my boy.\n\n“Boss…” Mike gasped.\n\nI seized the opportunity to throw the distracted grunt off my back, and I ran over to my son, whose body was jittering uncontrollably. He was in shock, and we both attempted to stem the bleeding from his handless wrist. Everybody watched Frankie meet the same fate as Warren. Leafy tentacles oozed from his orifices, consuming his body.\n\n“Fuck this!” Johnny barked, backing away.\n\nThe henchman bumped into a family portrait hanging on our wall, and something amazing happened — amazing, but ghastly. My wife, the miniature figure in the photograph, seized Johnny — her tiny hands wrapped around his throat and pulled him backwards.\n\nScreeching, the man disappeared into the frame, and I watched as the phantom photograph moved — my wife strangled the man until he lay limp, and then she dragged him out of view. My children and I remained static in the photograph, oblivious to the terrifying events unfolding around us.\n\n“No… I’m not dying here…” Mike, the final intruder, shrieked.\n\nHe turned on his heel and ran to the front door, but as he placed his hands on the woodwork, something inexplicable happened. He began to melt into the wood — he hands liquified, as did his arms, and then his body.\n\n“Stop it!” Mike screamed, vanishing into the door. “Make it…”\n\nHe trailed off as his body melded with the house. But I didn’t care — I was fixated on my son’s body, lying lifelessly in my arms. That was the only thing which terrified me. Cassie crept downstairs as I dialled 999, and we rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.\n\nDue to massive blood loss, my son slipped into a coma. I don’t know whether he’s going to make it. But I’m typing this post because my daughter and I witnessed one final spectacle of simultaneous beauty and terror.\n\n“Look, Dad,” Cassie whispered, pointing at a vase of flowers on the windowsill of the hospital room.\n\nPeonies. Anna’s favourite. And the way the night breeze caught the perfectly-pink bulbs, the flowers seemed to take the form of a woman holding the hand of a young boy — no, a young *man*. It was undoubtedly Anna and Jake.\n\nThe billowing wind danced across the room, carrying wispy words to Cassie and me.\n\n“Jake’s safe,” Anna whispered. “I’m trying to wake him up.”\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "When i was 26 years old i began working at Trinity Facility as a psychiatrist. I had just moved to the town near by. I had this one patient who still haunts me in my dreams and ill never be able to get him out of my head. It was1983 and the nurses were showing me to my office. A nurse named Genevieve warned me about a certain patient by the name of Keith. Apparently he had just been sent here after killing a doctor at his old facility. I told her \" ill be sure to keep my distance whenever i speak to him\" to reassure her. My first paitent was a woman named Freya. She was a paranoid schizophrenia. She told me about all of her friends that hung out with her before she came here. All of their names, what they were and why she liked them. She began to talk to me about how some of them stay with her in her room. Her favourtie friend being Haylee. Haylee wasnt a human but an dog. Freya believed that haylee was her guarduan angel. I had to up her dosage of medication as it was clear the meds she was on wasnt working well enough to stop her hallucinations. \n\nIt had been a few weeks and i had finally been assigned Mr Keith. I was told that i needed to go to his bedroom as he wasnt allowed to leave. When i entered i saw metal bars cutting the room in half, seperating him from me. He was staring out the window when i sat down. i had to call to him for him to turn around and acknowledge me. \n\n*Me: How are you doing today Keith?*\n\n*Him: Im doing fine Dr.* \n\n*Me: Thats very good to hear, ive come to talk to you about why you are here.* \n\n*Him: Theres nothing to say, im here because they believe im a lunatic*\n\n*Me: Who believe youre a lunatic?*\n\n*Him: the shadow people! they sent me here because i was going to share their secrets and they thought i was bonkers!*\n\n*Me: who are the whitemen keith*\n\n*Him: ohhhh you dont wanna know them Dr. they arent nice people, if they were i wouldnt be stuck in this shithole.*\n\nI paused. I was concerned about who these whitemen were and why he was so ademant they sent him here. He admitted himself to the hospital, no one sent him here. I decided to end our session not too long after our conversation as what he was saying was tsrating to freak me out. He did tell me the whitemen were ancient beings that come to use humans as a vessel. I assumed Keith was their vessel. I went home and did hours of research on who these Whitemen were and i was shocked about my new discoveries...\n\nThe whitemen were a group of 15 men all dresses in white suits. in 400 BC the White men went into the forest and procedeed to sacrifcie 17 human lives to their god, Muisis. The god of Death and Power. The white men drank all of their victims blood before all slitting their wrist and stepping into a fire. They also sacrificed themselves for their god. According to urban legend the whitemen return every 30 years to continue to sacrfice humans for their beloved God, Keith being the one who draws the humans in. I was sure that this was just a myth. a scary fairytale to tell children to behave or they will be sacrificed. that was until i saw them myself and became one of their sacrfices too..",

        "text": "Living in northern Minnesota and being a horror lover, I was always paranoid, but skeptical, of the 'not deer'. I thought I might've had a few encounters, but you can't be sure when you don't come face to face with something. I'm a see it before you believe it kinda guy. Now of course, I believe. Good lord, do I believe, because I think I pissed one off. \n\nLike I said, I live in northern Minnesota. I have a big German Shepard, her name is Stella, that I love to take on walks in the nearby woods. The forest is massive, but it's beautiful. I've never gone in too deep or at night, being eaten by a bear isn't exactly on my bucket list. But, a buddy of mine likes to go deer hunting in the woods during hunting season. He likes going in deep and camps out for days. He invited me along since it was that time of year, and reluctantly, I agreed. Stella came with for some added protection. I was no good with a gun, but I did bow hunting, so I packed up my weapon of choice, some clothes and whatnot. The basics and then some. 'Then some' being a six pack and some backup Newports. I know, I know, Newports are blah.\n\nWe hiked our way out to Mason's favorite hunting spot, a small field near a river. We set up camp in the field and for the first night we just shot the shit and went to bed. Come morning, it was hunting time. We woke up about eight in the morning and got to it. All dolled up in camo, we sat patiently with the trees, waiting for a thirsty deer. We missed two, caught one. Not too shabby. We headed back to camp, ate dinner, drank a little. I noticed Stella was on edge. I figured she'd heard a noise out in the woods. \"What is it, Stella? Squirrel scared 'ya?\" I laughed and patted her on the head.\n\n\"No, wait. Listen,\" Mason said, and I did. \"Do you hear that?\" I gave him a 'are-you-fucking-with-me' look. I heard nothing but the fire crackling. After listening a little closer, I realized what he meant. I heard *nothing*. No frogs, no crickets, no birds, no rustling in the surrounding woods. Okay, now I'm freaked out. \n\nThen, I saw something. It was on all fours, kinda hunched over and massive. Of course, a fucking bear. Must've scared everything off. But, it looked real thin for a bear. I got out my bow, lining up the shot. No way in hell was I getting eaten by some starving bear tonight. Mason didn't protest, so I shot. It hit the bear, but it didn't react. A few seconds later, it's charging at us at full speed. \"What the fuck is that?\" I screamed. Stella went running into the forest, and me and Mason were frozen in fear. That was no bear, it looked deformed, gray, thin, and my god was it tall. Wendigos don't look like what you see in mainstream media. Their skin is grey and tight, their bodies bony, and the teeth are huge. \n\nMason quickly grabbed his gun, but a few rounds did nothing. We ran towards the tree-line as fast as we could, but it was gaining on us. \"It's a fucking wendigo, Ethan! Holy shit, holy shit, we need to hide!\" Mason yelled. We made a rapid dash into the forest. We ran on rocks over the river, but I slipped and fell into the water.\n\nMason quickly helped me up. Surely, the monster was even closer now. We jumped over a fallen tree and took cover by it. Fast footsteps approached us, and we could hear it. It's breathing sounded musty, and the smell was pungent, like a rotting body. I held a finger to my lips, telling Mason to be quiet. I had a hand over my mouth to muffle my breathing. When it finally left, we slowly left our hiding spot. Running back to our campsite, we only grabbed what we needed before making our way to the trails. We were far out, about 12 miles, and we knew it would take a long time to find our way back in the dark. \n\nAfter half an hour of walking, we sat to take a break. It seemed like we were safe now. I was worried sick about Stella, my sweet girl. But, we had to keep going. That's when I hear familiar barking a few yards out. \"Stella?\" I yelled. \"Stella, c'mere girl! I'm right here, Stella!\" I ran towards the sound, happy to find my dog. The barking started coming from all around me, and I was confused. Then, it stopped suddenly. It was dead silent again. I felt my body freeze and my heart stop.\n\n\"Ethan! Get back here, it's a trap! The wendigo is mimicking Stella! Run!\" Mason yelled out to me. No, no, no this can't be happening. Then, I heard Mason scream. I whispered an apology and ran. I didn't know where I was going, but I ran like hell. I heard it following me. The fast, inhuman running. Then suddenly, I was tackled to the ground. The thing looked me dead in the eyes, inching closer and closer, drooling on me. It had blood on it's mouth. Blood. Mason's blood. \n\nIt sunk it's teeth into my shoulder. I screamed and shoved a finger into it's eye. It popped, it was fucking disgusting. The thing got off of me, screaming and putting a hand over it's eye. I took the opportunity to run like hell. My shoulder burned, it took out a chunk when it got off. I knew I was definitely going to have a scar after this.\n\nAll I could do was run. I just kept going until finally, it all went black. I was found the next day by park rangers, and now I'm in the hospital. I've been here for a few days, being treated for a serious infection, blood loss, and I might need surgery on my shoulder and back. Turns out I damaged my spine when I was thrown to the ground. Mason hasn't been found, and I'm not sure I want to know what happened to him. On a good note, they found Stella. She found some campers and they took care of her, thank god. \n\nI'm still scared. I live right next to those woods. At night I can't sleep, and sometimes I'll hear tapping on the window. I'm on the 7th floor, so I hope to god it's just my imagination. If those fuckers can climb I am fleeing the country. Sometimes I hear something saying my name, and it sounds like Mason - but not Mason. If anything happens, I'll update. But for now, I'm just gonna relax while I recover. Please, for the love of god, do not piss off a wendigo.",

        "text": " \n\nI woke up to the sound of rain hitting my window. It was coming down hard, and I knew I was in for a wet walk to my workspace. I got dressed, put on my raincoat and grabbed my umbrella. As I stepped outside, a chill ran down my spine. It was unusually cold, and the wind was howling like a banshee.\n\nThe streets were deserted, and I felt like I was the only one crazy enough to venture out in this weather. The sound of raindrops hitting the pavement was the only noise I could hear. As I walked, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. It was a figure standing in the shadows, watching me.\n\nI quickened my pace, feeling my heart pounding in my chest. My shoes splashed through puddles of water, and my umbrella struggled to stay open against the wind. But I kept going, determined to make it to my meeting.\n\nFinally, I arrived at my workspace, drenched from head to toe. As I opened the door, I noticed that the room was eerily silent. It was as if someone had been there but had disappeared without a trace.\n\nI sat down for my meeting, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. Suddenly, I heard a creaking sound coming from the ceiling. I looked up and saw a pair of glowing eyes staring back at me.\n\nI jumped up, knocking over my chair, and ran out of the room. As I raced down the hall, I heard footsteps following me. I turned around but saw no one.\n\nFinally, I made it outside, gasping for air. The rain had stopped, and the sun was peeking through the clouds. I looked back at the building and saw that the windows were now dark and empty.\n\nAs the days went by, I couldn't stop thinking about the strange incident at my workspace. I decided to do some research and found out that the building had a dark history. It used to be a hospital, and there were rumors of patients being mistreated and even tortured.\n\nMy curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to investigate further. I went back to the building, armed with a flashlight and a camera. As I explored the abandoned halls and rooms, I felt a sense of dread washing over me.\n\nI heard strange noises, like whispers and moans, coming from the walls. I saw shadows moving in the corners of my eyes, but when I turned to look, there was nothing there.\n\nAs I reached the basement, I found a room that was locked from the outside. I tried to open it, but it wouldn't budge. Suddenly, I heard a voice whispering my name. I turned around, but there was no one there.\n\nI tried to leave, but the door was now locked. Panic set in, and I started to run, looking for a way out. But the more I tried, the more lost I became.\n\nFinally, I found myself back in the room I started in, and I saw the figure that had been watching me before. It was a ghostly apparition, pale and gaunt, with glowing eyes.\n\nI tried to run again, but the ghostly figure followed me, reaching out with long, bony fingers. I struggled to break free, but it was no use. The ghostly figure was too strong.\n\nAs the ghostly figure held me tight, I felt a coldness creep over me. It was as if my very soul was being drained from me. I tried to scream, but no sound escaped my lips.\n\nFinally, the ghostly figure released me and disappeared into the shadows. I lay on the floor, gasping for breath  \n\nI crawled towards the door, and to my surprise, it was now unlocked. I stumbled outside and collapsed on the street. The rain had started again, and it felt like needles hitting my skin.\n\nAs I lay there, shivering and scared, I realized that I had been lucky to escape. I knew that I could never go back to that building again. It was cursed, haunted by the spirits of those who had suffered there.\n\nFrom that day on, I worked from home, too scared to venture out into the city. I couldn't shake the feeling that the ghostly figure was still watching me, waiting for its next victim.\n\nAnd whenever it rained, I stayed inside, safe from the horrors that lurked in the darkness. I knew that I could never forget the terror that I had experienced that fateful day, and I was forever changed by it.",

        "text": "It was the third time I passed the same ‘Welcome to Chikitaw’ sign that I knew something was wrong. The road was winding and claustrophobic with trees encroaching on the sides of the road or ditches that you just knew your car wouldn’t get out of. Unfortunately, it was also the kind of back country road that was the only way to get to where you were going. \n\nWork wanted me to get to this no-name township and do soil readings on a gas station. Simple stuff. But I needed to take this road and driving it ate half of my day. A 4 hour drive to only go 45 miles. It wasn’t even very late, somewhere around 9:00 - 9:30. I really needed to pee and obviously I was doing something wrong, so I pulled over. Thankfully, there was a nice treeline I could hide and piss in. Don’t judge me, but I had to go.\n\nThe first time I saw that car was when I was walking back. There was a beat-up station wagon, sea green, 30 years old, and an exhaust that put bikers in their place. It was one of those vehicles held together by dirt and spite that if you gave it a carwash it may stop working.\n\nThe cabin overhead light was on, so you could see the driver clearly. She was yelling into her phone and barely paying attention to the road, swerving like it was her first time driving or she was drinking..\n\nI hate it when people drive like that. But I shook my head clear, checked my phone GPS, and started driving again. \n\nI passed that damn sign again.\n\nI was swearing up and down at my phone and telling myself I never even made a turn. But this pass, I saw that station wagon on the side of the road. Hazard lights were blinking and the driver looked really upset.\n\nDon’t judge me, but I didn’t stop. Listen, I’m a guy, she is a lady, and she had a phone on her. Some cop or sheriff would come and get her. Heck, as I drove by she was still yelling at her phone.\n\nBut seeing her made me forget I just drove by the sign, well up until I passed it a fifth time. I know I screamed ‘fuck’ and at least one blasphemy. I slowed down at that point, looking for a side road or driveway to turn off to. Then I started pulling up by that damned station wagon again.\n\nThe woman was out of the car now, jumping, waving her arms, and hollering at me. So I pulled over behind her car and rolled my window down. \n\n“Please help me!” She was crying, and not like movie tears, but the kind of crying that makes snot run down your nose. The kind of crying that makes you stop and heave air. I told her something along the lines of “get in.” She plopped down in the seat next to me and took a good 10 minutes to pull herself together enough to talk to me.\n\n“I have been driving past that sign all night. I can’t find a way off this road.” My skin prickled up and tingled.\n\nI felt bad, but I had to tell her the truth as I saw it. “Well, I don’t want to alarm ya’, but I’ve driven by that damned thing 5 times now. Have you called the law? I got my phone here, fully charged. We can wait for them to show up.”\n\n“I have been on the phone with them over and over again. Every time I pass the sign, it hangs up. When I call back, they act like they’ve never talked to me before.” \n\nI called the law anyway, I mean, sometimes they take men a bit more seriously. The dispatcher said that I was breaking up and that I should try and find a better signal. ‘Fair enough’ I thought, so I drove a little bit to see if we could hear each other better and then bam, call drops. \n\nAnd we passed that goddamned sign again.\n\nThe woman broke down crying again and I couldn’t blame her. I am sure I started yelling since she got much more upset. We drove some more, and we never did see her car again. After passing the sign another time, I decided to stop next to the damnable thing. \n\nI didn’t know what I was planning on doing. I just knew I was angry and she was following behind me sobbing. The stress was too much. Once near the sign, I used the light on my phone to show the whole thing. It read: ‘Welcome to Chikitaw, Population 11 / 12’ .\n\n“That is really odd.” I looked back at her.\n\n“What does that mean?” She was doing her best to hold it together and failing pretty badly. Her eyes darted everywhere, like something was going to snatch her away. \n\n“Don’t know. Let’s look around it. Sometimes the Sheriff Deputies hide magazines and booze near these signs. Maybe we can find something that will help.”\n\nShe nodded at me and we walked around the simple wooden sign. We didn’t find any skin rags or hooch. Not even a cigarette butt. Yet we did find a pair of handcuffs, with one end firmly attached to the sign and the other open. No key or anything. Just the cuffs.\n\n“Why would these be here?”\n\nNot sure if I responded, but I got a closer look at the cuffs. They were attached with a metal hasp bolted to the sign itself, and when I shined my light down the line, I saw eleven empty places for more cop bracelets.\n\n“I think the town is looking for a new resident.” I looked at the lady, she was badly shaken and standing there waiting for me to do something.\n\nDon’t judge me, but I sure as hell did something. I pushed her to the sign and got those cuffs on her. She put up a fight, put a scar on my arm, but I was bigger and faster. I ran back to my car with her screaming obscenities at me.\n\nI drove fast, like I was trying to outrun the devil himself. Maybe I was. But I passed the sign again, but it felt different. I heard her screaming, but it sounded more like a wounded animal. I didn’t look in the mirror to see her behind that sign.\n\nI drove past the damned sign one last time, it was easier to read from the car this time.\n\n‘Welcome to Chikitaw, Population 12’\n\nI didn’t hear screaming any more. In a half hour I found myself near a truckstop at 4:31AM. When I pulled in, I just sat and stared into the distance. I didn’t know whether I dreamt it or was losing my mind or what. But in the passenger seat, a phone started ringing. The woman left her phone in my car. The screen said “Mom”.\n\nDon’t judge me, but I smashed that phone and put it in the trash. I spent my time in hell and I wasn’t going to no prison. I heard they found a busted station wagon a couple weeks later off the side of the road, but no sign of the driver.  I found a new job close to home and I don’t ever drive any more back roads.",

        "text": "I grew up in a rural village in England called Hascombe and the term village is overselling it if you ask me. A few houses and a pub you would barely notice driving through but for the 'please drive carefully through our village' signs. Our house was between 2 roads, the road that passed through was 'The Street' and the one behind us was 'Hoe Lane'.\n\nOur house didn't have an exit to Hoe Lane, no house in the village did. The only use for Hoe Lane was to access a beautiful mansion at the end of it. Nothing else. I was told that Winston Churchill stayed there and that was the reason for the tall fences blocking access from the rear of our house and the other houses next to us.\n\nI would have been about 14 years old when I started smoking. My mother and father both smoked but would have whooped me if they found out I did too. I kept it away from the house. Hoe Lane became my go to place for a smoke before bed, I would walk down the street then up hoe lane for a couple of hundred metres just to be safe. It was so quiet, fence on one side and woods on the other. The mansion at the top was only used as a holiday home so no cars. All I would hear was faint traffic from the main road in the distance. A very peaceful place is what I thought.\n\nThat night I was puffing away on my cigarette oblivious to the outside world. I heard a twig snapping in the wooded side of the road. I barely registered - animals live in the woods and it's not unusual if you hear them. \n\nThen a louder crunch. I look across and see nothing but darkness. I'm on edge but not fearful yet.\n\nSuddenly I hear what sounds like a tree trunk snapping. Instinctively I looked at the woods where the sound came from and I saw... nothing. My heart started racing - I knew I heard it and it couldn't be explained by a fucking deer or badger. Something was in those woods and very close\n\nI drop my cigarette to the floor but otherwise I am frozen, staring into the woods for any sign of movement. Nothing... I saw nothing but what I heard was enough to freak me out\n\nI stayed frozen, my mind not working. Stuck in the fright response you might say. I remain in paralysis until...\n \nA screech is the best way to describe it but doesn't do it justice. The noise was inhuman, driiling into the skull more than theveardrums. Yet the noise wasn't the thing. What terrified me was the proximity. This noise, this awful noise came from 2 feet from where I stood.\n\nI panicked, I found my feet and I fucking fled for my life. Only when I ran back down Hoe Lane this thing, whatever it was, matched me step for step. The screeching, the crunching and snapping noises only grew until I felt I would pass out. My only solace was that the noises remained on the woods side, not the lane I was running down. Yet as I got close to the end of the lane the woods/lane barrier broke. The screeches became deafening, as if from 2 inches away and through loudspeaker directly to my brain. The noises of trees breaking only intensified the same way, I can't explain or even imagine hundreds of trees trunks snapping at once but that is what I heard.\n\nI made the end of the lane and everything stopped. Quiet resumed. I told myself it was my imagination but I know it wasnt really.\n\nStupid me went back into those woods many times (not from hoe lane - never returned) and noticed no animals appear to live there and the trees are all dead. Bluebells and stinging nettles thrive, make of that what you will.",

        "author": "The_Misery_Man",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11mathx/i_made_my_wishlist_on_xbox_public_now_something/",
        "text": "Did you know you can make your wishlist on your xbox public?\n\nIt was the first time I had noticed the option, a couple of weeks ago. I guess it made sense, you can make your wishlist public and then anyone could look at it and buy you a game, as a gift or something.\n\nI am a lonely person who doesn’t really have any friends; I live with my mum in a three-story apartment, where I spend most of my time on the bottom floor, in my room playing video games on my Xbox One.\n\nSo, when I was bored and I was flicking through the Microsoft Store, I noticed the option to make my wishlist public and thought ‘Hey, why not?’\n\nIt was one of those small opening-up moments, where I think that I am making some first step to opening up to others and getting out of the isolated, cocoon room I called home, but in reality: I really wasn’t.\n\nI have almost always struggled to make friends and the last time I had anyone I considered a friend, I was still in secondary school. Now, I am in my early 20s and have no one outside of my family I could truly call a friend.\n\nThis isn't me opening up to the world or anything like that. This is me warning anyone who might read this.\n\nThen that was it, I simply made my wishlist public and I thought no more of it, why should it matter; no one would bother looking at it. And if anyone did, why would they care?\n\nThen, about a week later, out of the blue, I received a redeem code for one of the games on my wishlist from someone as a ‘gift’.\n\nIt was one of the £70 to £80 games on my wishlist, one of the ones which I was waiting to go on sale before buying: I am quite a cheapskate when it comes down to buying any games on xbox.\n\nThe gamertag was Fiend900, you know the usual gamertag of someone who just got their profile and hadn’t tailored their gamertag to their liking.\n\nI just assumed it was an accident and messaged back telling him that he accidentally gifted me a game for quite a lot of money.\n\nAlmost seconds later, he messaged me back simply “Take it.”\n\nNothing else, “Take it.” Like it was no big deal. Though looking back, I think it was more of a command than a ‘Here, take this.’\n\nWhat else could I do, there would have been no way that could have been a mistake. He literally told me to take it.\n\nFuck, I regret that! Maybe even more than making my wishlist public in the first place.\n\nAt the time, I assumed it was some kind of giveaway; like you see those streamers do – I don’t watch any streams or giveaway channels.\n\nI thought then that was it. Though it was worth making my wishlist public, it did get me a rather-of-my-budget game I wanted.\n\nBut then he just kept giving me games over the next few days.\n\nEven weirder, he would occasionally attach messages that criticised the games, or more specifically; me for playing those games.\n\nThey were quite creative criticisms, criticising the low-budget graphics, the repetitive gameplay and such.\n\nThough, they felt aimed at me.\n\nOne I can remember was like “Huh, you really like wasting your time on this long, boring game? Get a life!” or “Really, this game? Do you really expand your gaming experience with this one? There are so many games you already have that are like this one. Grow up!” I half expected him to swear in his messages, but I guess he can’t.\n\nWhen I was tired of his sarky remarks, I finally decided to message him back asking why he was being so judgemental of the games I played.\n\nHe replied “You are the one wishing for these games on your dumb little list. You are the one who chooses to waste your life on these fictional, fanboy games designed to drain your wallet. You are calling the shots! You should expect criticism!” or something like that.\n\nI couldn’t argue with him, of course. But, I was still confused why he was doing this in the first place. I asked him and he said he was just being nice. Said “Do you not want these games? I don’t understand. I was just being nice.”\n\nI also couldn’t argue with that; he bought me my games and I just accepted them without even a thank you. He felt too mean to thank, yet I couldn't help but feel he might be lonely. It’s strange to think that now, but I did back then.\n\nTo me, Fiend was just some lonely, rich kid who only wanted attention.\n\nWell, he had gotten his attention, but thinking this didn’t stop me from being upset by his retorts.\n\nI decided to look at his xbox profile. I was shocked to see nothing.\n\nHe had played no games, had no followers, no friends, no numerical gamerscore of playing anything, nothing. It was as though he just made the profile.\n\nLooking back, he must have made it about a week ago.\n\nI just felt bad for him, perhaps I shouldn’t have, he could have made the profile just to mess with me somehow or even go as far as scam me in some way. But, I couldn’t help but feel he was some new kid who hadn’t made any friends where he lived and had just discovered xbox for the first time ever.\n\nWhat else could I think?\n\nAnother week passed, and Fiend had bought me all of the games on my wishlist.\n\nHe must’ve spent about £300. I mean, none of the games he got me were on sale at the time. Who does this? But, if I am being completely honest; I did not question it at all. I wish I did.\n\nI was going to try and thank him in some sort of way, I was going to ask whether he wanted to play a game with me. Not any he had gifted me, he didn’t have any, he didn’t seem to like them and they are mainly single-player games anyway.\n\nSo, I was going to ask whether he would want to play Overwatch 2 or maybe I could reinstall Fortnite; a game he can play for free.\n\nBut then as I was composing the message – like he knew what I was doing – he messaged me.\n\nIt was the weirdest message so far and I don’t think I will ever forget it. It simply read “I have given you what you value. Now, you owe me…”\n\nI was like “What the actual fuck!” The message was so different from any other messages he had sent me: “You owe me…” What did that mean?\n\nSo, I replied “I’m sorry, I didn’t realise you wanted something in return. Perhaps, you could refund some of the games you have given me.” I was trying to sound formal and polite, I had stumbled into something deeper than I had thought and he was clearly agitated. Though he couldn’t refund most of the earlier games he had given me, because I had already redeemed them, he could still refund some of the later games; the 2 or 3 I hadn’t redeemed yet.\n\nLittle did I know then, the next message was even weirder. He said, “No, you belong to me!”\n\nI chuckled at this one, it sounded oddly sexual.\n\nHe had the wrong impression of me, so I messaged “Ok, I don’t know what you are thinking, but I am not interested in you in that way. I don’t even know who you are. I’m sorry.” I did realise how harsh that sounded, but I had to stand up for myself in a mature and adult fashion, he couldn't treat me like this.\n\nHe repeated, “You belong to me.” Was he not getting the message?\n\n“Listen, you seem like a nice person, but I do not know you. I am sorry.”\n\n“You belong to me.”\n\n“That's enough, stop it! Or I am going to block you!”\n\n“You belong to me.”\n\nIt was getting creepy. No matter what I messaged, he would just say “You belong to me.”\n\nSo, I blocked him.\n\nThough, it did seem to take a while, not sure why; but my console was whirling noisily and getting very hot. Like when it boots up a demanding game. I ignored it.\n\nThen, I reported him and simply said he was being creepy and toxic.\n\nI moved on and that was that, at least for the rest of that day.\n\nI will remember the next day until I die.\n\nThat morning was on a weekday, so I had to get up early in the morning to go to work. I get up at 6 a.m. and I am always the first to wake in the apartment. I did what I do every morning: I cleaned my teeth, got dressed and got ready to go.\n\nI noticed I had left my xbox on overnight. I don’t think I had ever done that before, but it didn’t matter. I turned it off.\n\nBefore I leave every morning, I would open the blinds. Not to see anything, but so we, me and my mum, don’t look anti-social to people passing by. Though that morning, I did see something.\n\nIt was only there for a split second, yet I could have sworn I saw a naked, pale figure on the other side of the road, dashing off out of view. It was like it was trying not to be seen by me, like it was looking over and, as though it somehow knew I was opening the blinds, it ran off.\n\nSo when I saw it, I gasped and a second later looked down the road to see who it was.\n\nOutside our apartment, you can see across the road with the only closest turn off the pathway on the opposite side being about 10 metres away.\n\nIt was gone. Somehow, it got out of sight within a single second.\n\nWhether or not it turned around that corner to get out of sight, I will never know; there was nowhere else it could have gone.\n\nThough it made me jump at the time, I had to move on with my day. So, I chalked it up to a jogger running past – they do that in my town early in the morning – or my imagination and I moved on, forgetting all about it.\n\nWell, I didn’t forget about it. How could I? I had never seen anything like it before. It didn’t help that at work, I was listening to horror podcasts; most of which had pale, figured cryptids in them.\n\nOn my way home, I had that really strong feeling that someone, or something, was following me.\n\nThis wasn’t uncommon for me; when it was dark and uncrowded, but it was broad daylight and in the centre of the town market.\n\nIt’s not like I saw anything to give me that feeling, I just had that feeling.\n\nI got home and once again my xbox was on. I distinctly remembered turning it off this time.\n\nPerhaps, something brushed past the power button and turned it on. Like any Xbox One or 360, that happens from time to time. But, what could’ve brushed up against the button; my mum doesn’t go into my room without my knowledge, at least I strongly believe that she doesn’t. Nothing could have stirred in my room enough to power on my console by accident.\n\nThis reminded me of Fiend and our last chat. This was the first time I connected the strange figure from that morning to Fiend, though the idea that they were connected stressed me out too much to seriously consider.\n\nI powered down my console and unplugged it.\n\nNothing felt wrong again until about 10 o'clock, I was watching Youtube on my laptop.\n\nMarkiplier was doing one of his ‘it's behind you bits’ in a  ‘3 Scary Games’ video: the cheesy, stupid humour that keeps me working all day.\n\nYet, I couldn't shake the feeling. Something felt like it was behind me.\n\nLike, maybe the room got colder by half a degree or I could faintly smell the salt of someone sweating in the room. I honestly don’t know. I could just feel it. Like when something has been removed from your room, even though you weren’t even conscious of that thing being there in the first place, and yet, you can just tell something is missing.\n\nI spent the next half an hour looking at the screen for a minute or two and then glancing behind myself, seeing nothing.\n\nEventually, I paused the video I was watching and surveyed my room from my chair; spinning as a satellite dish would.\n\nI think it was only for about 10 seconds, though it felt a lot longer. Looking and looking again to confirm and reconfirm that I was alone in my room. I even closed my eyes occasionally to try and hear anything in my room.\n\nWhen I was satisfied, I turned back to my screen.\n\nIt was right there, right behind me!\n\nOff the reflection of the darker side of my laptop screen, in the corner of my eye!\n\nSaved as a screenshot in my brain forever – the same being looking in through my window that morning – drifting out of view.\n\nFrom what I could see more clearly this time, it wasn’t human.\n\nThe skin was far too pale, more the skin of a corpse than anything else. Not that it was a corpse, in any sense, it was just the skin wrapped so tightly around its frame. Like a Skinwalker would wear the skin of a person, yet this thing's skin was wrapped so tightly around its bones, that it had to have been the skin of somebody half its size.\n\nIt was naked, as it was before, and roughly the same size as me: though extremely slender and dangerously underweight.\n\nThat's all I could say about it. I only saw its mid-section: torso and arms, but I think my mind would break if it saw anything else.\n\nI don’t exactly know how I reacted.\n\nI saw it only a moment longer than last time and was choking on a bit of saliva at the back of my throat. My hands were desperately trying to find my chair's armrests to strangle and my legs were desperately trying to skid my chair away across the wooden, glossy floor.\n\nOnly a second passed until I could swallow and finally scream.\n\nYet, my scream only lasted 1 or 2 seconds, before my eyes started darting around the room to try and find it again.\n\nAnd once more it was gone. Vanished completely from sight!\n\nHow could it just vanish when the direction it was moving in was towards the back of my room? Where did it go? Where could it go?\n\nI found myself glancing at the xbox, yet this time it was off.\n\nBut, the feeling couldn’t elude me, that it was on and it just soundlessly turned itself off upon me looking at it. Like, when I was scanning my room; it was on in the background and I was too distracted by whatever else was in my room to notice it.\n\nI didn’t know what else to do, but I had to catch my breath and steady my heartbeat; they were both running at 1000%.\n\nI thought for quite some time, maybe an hour or so, I don’t know. I decided I should call it a day and I went to bed, hoping my dreams would let me escape my hellish hallucinations. That's all I hoped they were: hellish hallucinations.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nThe sound of my console turning itself on woke me up. I didn’t budge much at first, I was still half asleep.\n\n*Do doo!*\n\nThe sound of my console turning itself off. This time I opened my eyes.\n\nIt was pitch black and I had no inkling of the time. And I mean pitch black; my TV didn’t have its standby light on, my other console's supply bricks were dead and anything that could admit any light was consumed by the darkness.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nThe light from the console was the only light which had power, even though it was unplugged. It came back on after about 10 seconds.\n\n*Do doo!*\n\nIt turned off again after the same amount of time and the room went back to black. With nothing else to focus on, I focused my eyes on the corner of my room.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nI noticed some movement in the corner. Like when you look out into the darkness and it looks like something is moving there, but then you notice nothing is moving there at all.\n\n*Do doo!*\n\nFocussing harder, it still looked that way. No matter how hard I would focus, the corner still looked occupied by something.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nWait. Something looked as though it was coming out towards me; a figure. So faint, yet so present.\n\n*Do doo!*\n\nI tried to move, panicked now. For some reason, I couldn’t.\n\nWas this sleep paralysis? I had never experienced sleep paralysis before then, but people can hallucinate things when having sleep paralysis.\n\nThis was sleep paralysis, wasn’t it? Or was I scared stiff? I slammed my eyes shut and put my whole body weight onto them.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nI was sure that thing was in front of me now, if I had opened my eyes I would finally realise my delusions. Yet, I couldn’t out of sheer fear.\n\nI just tried to sleep instead, to escape into my world of dreams. Any nightmare I could conjure would have been better than this.\n\n*Do doo! Do ding! Do doo! Do ding!*\n\nI have no idea how many repetitions of that sound went by before I would open my eyes again. The sound which I would usually get a dopamine release every time I heard it, was then and will now and forever be just as daunting a noise as death's bell.\n\nI had to face it. I opened my eyes.\n\n*Do ding!*\n\nNothing.\n\nMy console was still on, but there was nothing I could see. The repeating sound of my console had stopped.\n\nIt felt like I could finally breathe a fresh sigh of relief. That moment of joy was as blissful as water in a desert.\n\nIt was over until it wasn’t.\n\nI felt it first at my feet, every nerve in my body was operating far above what was normal. The press against the foot of my bed, that of something leaning on it. Then, it stepped onto the mattress making the air within audibly gush very quietly. It felt like footsteps walking the length of the bed, just behind where I lay. It was so light, the same weight of shoes gently placed on the bed. Impossibly sparse for how big the entity was. Though, the thudding of its steps was still audible, only just.\n\n*Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!*\n\nIt stopped at the head of the bed for a second, before finally slinking down into a lying position just behind me, forbidding any physical contact with me by only a few inches.\n\nMy heart was leaping from my chest.\n\nBut, then I could feel its breathing. It was heavy, like a pig in heat. I could feel the moisture from its breath settle on the nape of my neck and the strands of what I believed to be its thin hair whip softly against the new damp spot. Yet, once more, it sounded so quiet; so impossibly quiet for how heavy its breathing was.\n\nThough throughout this, I still could not move; proving it was fear I was under the power of, not mere sleep paralysis. My body had locked itself in place like my joints were filled with cement.\n\nTime passed before it was whispering something. I couldn’t hear what it was saying at first, its voice was so soft and silent.\n\nIt was repeating something. My name. Every word sharpened its unseen tongue again and again. Sharper and sharper and sharper and sharper.\n\nThen finally, it spat out slowly: “You, owe, me… You belong to me!”\n\n*‘Do doo!’*\n\nThe room fell still, just as it should have been, in a single instant.\n\nThe unplugged console was off and all the other standby lights had power again, giving the room a light, artificial glow.\n\nI couldn’t say how my body was; it had unlocked itself, but all my organs and joints felt weak.\n\nI felt the covers behind me: it was gone.\n\nI don’t know how I slept after that, but I can say I most likely passed out.\n\nThe next morning, I told work I felt a bit too ill to come in. That wasn’t entirely false.\n\nI knew I had to do something, this ‘entity’ wasn’t going away.\n\nSo, I started with the obvious and considered calling the police. I would have told them that something was stalking me and that it had gotten into my room somehow, got into bed with me and left without leaving any trace of its presents behind.\n\nOh, and that it was a fourth-dimensional pervert. That would have gotten me a nice, warm bed in the loonie bin.\n\nI considered telling mum, but though she is more likely to believe me, I don’t want her to get involved. I have no idea how this thing operates.\n\nSo, I decided that I need to know more about this thing.\n\nI plugged my xbox back in and looked for Fiend or who I believed was my invader from last night.\n\nI did expect I wouldn’t find anything new, but the profile was gone.\n\nNo, not deleted, just outright gone.\n\nThe chats I had with Fiend, the redeem codes I had gotten from him, the fact I reported/blocked his profile, all of it: gone.\n\nI still had the games from Fiend, but that was it.\n\nSo, I gave up on that idea and tried searching google for this entity.\n\nThis was also a dead-end however, I couldn’t find any demons who operate like this being or any mythical creatures that capture humans through Xbox Live. I tried cryptids and, well let's just say there are more pale, slender cryptids than I thought on the internet.\n\nMaybe, it was how I was researching this thing? Though, I don’t know how to search the internet for anything like this in the first place.\n\nI have had no luck finding anything out about this entity.\n\nBut, maybe I could evade this thing? Perhaps, I could get far enough away from my console to lose it? It may have found me at work, but maybe it has a range limit.\n\nThough, this was assuming it is tied down to my console somehow. And I don’t think I have it in me to run away; I would have to disappear, change my name and everything that makes me who I am. I don’t think I could make my mum go through that.\n\nI was running out of ideas. The best one I had was going back onto my xbox to find out more about Fiend. That idea was going in the right direction but I needed a new lead.\n\nThen I thought, maybe Microsoft could help me. I called their customer service line.\n\nFrom what I could find out from them: you can't delete an xbox profile; only change your gamertag, profiles don’t just disappear and that my story was crazy and I should be contacting the police or someone I knew who could ‘help’ me.\n\nThough, when I was about to throw in the towel and hang up, the young woman who I was speaking to said something sympathetically along the lines of “Look, have you shared your wishlist with anyone?”\n\nI told her no and said, “I saw the option, but I had no reason to select it.”\n\n“Well, then I know your story is false,” she replied, sounding more hopeful. “If this person was giving you games, then they would be doing it blindly. Even if you made your wishlist public, no one should be able to see it unless you shared it with someone else before.”\n\n“What?” I asked. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I had this issue with one of my friends before. The option should be left of the ‘settings’ option on your wishlist. When you select this and you have set your wishlist to ‘public’, then it should give you the option to share your wishlist with other people. Otherwise, no one should be able to view it.”\n\nI froze when she said this. My mind was a mess. If what she said was true; then everything I had experienced up until then was supposed to be impossible.\n\n“H-hello?” she spoke through the phone after I didn’t respond.\n\nAll I could do at that moment was tell her I had to go and hang up the phone.\n\nI looked over at my console and I was fairly sure it was looking back at me. Whatever I provoked, it was because of my xbox: it had found me.\n\nI saw red. I picked up the console and as hard as I could, I threw it down. It smashed into the hard ground and I went to pick it up again and I threw it again and again and again. I did this until it looked more like a wrecked car than an Xbox One.\n\nI then opened the door to my closet and dumped it on the hard closet floor. I did feel a pang of pain because I did enjoy playing games on it. But, I felt this had to be done.\n\nAfter that, I gave up and started writing this.\n\nI don’t know what to conclude; I didn’t learn anything from this.\n\nSomething found my wishlist on my xbox – through some unknown means, I cannot say how; it could have hacked me for all I know –, bought me the games on it and started to stalk me.\n\nWhat it is, I can only guess it came from somewhere beyond our reality and does not follow the same logic as we do.\n\nIt came looking for somebody, maybe specifically me. Maybe I have something it wants.\n\nThough I don’t know what it wants with me, I can say it does not have good intentions. That I can be sure of.\n\nI do think, however, this thing somehow bought me with the games it gave me. It gave me those games knowing I would take them without question and when I did, this thing found me.\n\nIf I didn’t take those games, maybe it wouldn't have found me. Maybe, it doesn’t matter; maybe it would find me anyway.\n\nPlease, whatever you do, do not make this same mistake.\n\nThis happened to me, but this could still happen to anyone else.\n\nMaybe my situation is unique. Even if this is the case, supernatural or not, there will be someone out there that will want to use you. Someone with ill intentions that, if he ever gets the chance, will try to manipulate you. Offer you gifts, which you take without even meeting them first, and then that person will start demanding things from you; favours, money, influence or even your very body.\n\nThe kindness of strangers cannot be blindly trusted, because they may want something in return.\n\nIf only I had the chance to go out and socialise. Well, I did, but I didn’t take it. And that just led me to this point.\n\nPerhaps, you can’t trust the kindness of strangers, but you could still go out into the world and meet people who you can trust. People who like you and respect who you are. People who you can see in the flesh and don’t ask for anything in return.\n\nBecause, when you get to know a person, they stop being a stranger. I just hope you have the strength I never had. I think it's too late for me.\n\nI can hear my console power up from my closet. Despite the fact it doesn’t look like an Xbox One anymore; it apparently still works fine.\n\nListen to this at least; if you can find someone on xbox with the gamertag Fiend900, then get away from it; it is not human and will only mean you ill will.\n\nI think it is calling to me. I must face it, I don’t know why but I feel like I need to face it. I don’t think I could live with myself if I didn’t.\n\nI’ve got to go.",

        "text": "\n[Part Five](https://redd.it/118hzr8)\n\n**** \n\n\nMy chest was on fire as we cut down another side street.  Holliman was lagging behind, croaking out breathless directions as he tried to read the map while staying ahead of the growing mob behind us.  We were going to die here.  None of us really knew where we were going, and Mrs. Graves’ arm was bleeding steadily from where that kid had stuck her a few minutes earlier.  It might be enough to kill her in time, but that wouldn’t be a problem.\n\nThe people of Braxton would tear us apart long before then.\n\n**** \n\n“Keep her head still.  They’re starting to twitch more, and it has to get in at the inner canthus precisely to have a full effect.”\n\nNodding, I leaned forward, my knees digging into the dreaming woman’s shoulders as I tightened my inner thighs’ grip on the sides of her head.  We had done this more than fifty times in the last three hours and I was getting very tired, but Graves was right.  They were starting to fight back a bit more.\n\nWe’d started with the two cops outside of “You Sew and Sew”.  Graves got me to lay them both out flat on their backs and straddle their heads while putting weight on their shoulders “in case they have a sudden reaction to the Elixir.”  I wanted to ask what kind of “reaction” that might be, but I held my tongue for the moment.  Holding the larger man’s head steady, I’d opened his left eye as instructed while Graves dripped a single drop of Elixir into it.\n\nThe effect had been subtle but immediate.  The twitching tension that had been in the man’s body had melted away, replaced instead by soft, heavy snoring.  When I met Graves’ eyes, she nodded with a small smile.  “He’s truly sleeping now.”\n\n I frowned in return.  “He wasn’t before?”\n\nGraves shook her head.  “Not a natural sleep, no.  He was in a state of induced dreaming.  The Elixir has freed him from that.”\n\nI’d kept quiet then, but by the time we reached this latest woman, who went from violently spasming to sleeping peacefully with a single drop from Graves, I couldn’t help myself.  \n\n“What is it?  The Elixir I mean.”\n\n“Clint…”\n\n“No.  You guys say you want me here.  Need me.  Okay.  I’m here.  Fucking trapped here, apparently.  So do me a solid and stop jerking me around.”\n\nShe sighed and glanced around.  Holliman had gone off to find a map of the town or some other source of information.  Before he left, I’d asked why he didn’t just search the internet before we came here.  He gave me a hollow laugh and shrugged.  Said he’d tried, but the world has forgotten this place exists, and not just in people’s memories.  That reminder of how isolated we were here had been troubling, but Graves’ expression was somehow worse.  There was a degree of mistrust and fear in Graves’ face as she checked that her partner was not around.  Were they not as united and in control as they wanted me to believe?  And if not, what did that mean for our odds of escaping this place?\n\nSatisfied we were alone, she turned back to me.  “The Elixir is a substance that comes from the one we serve.”\n\n“Like, they make it for you?  Um, for us?”\n\nHer expression grew haunted.  “In a sense, yes.  Not in a laboratory or factory though.  It is essen…”\n\n“I found a map of the town finally.”  We both jumped slightly as Holliman approached.  Turning to him, I saw his expression was growing hard.  “What’re you two talking about?”\n\nI shook my head as I stood up from the sleeping woman, legs slightly trembling.  “Nothing.  Does the map show us where we need to go?”\n\nHolliman grimaced slightly.  “Potentially yes.  It’s one of these poorly drawn tourist maps.  The detail is there, but the scale?  I don’t know.  But it does show a ‘historic mine’ in the western edge of the city.  I’d guess that’ll be where we find what we’re looking for.”  He gestured down at the sleeping woman.  “Though we’ve got to work faster if we’re going to get to that point any time soon.”  He looked at Graves.  “How many have you done so far?”\n\nShe licked her lips.  “Fifty-three with this woman.”\n\nFrowning, he shook his head slightly.  “Not nearly enough yet.”\n\nI stepped forward.  “So how many is enough?  And enough for what?”\n\nHe shifted his gaze back to me.  “Enough to weaken the grip of the thing living here.  To give us a chance of not dying when we confront it.”\n\nSwallowing, I dropped my eyes.  “Um, okay.  So does that mean we have to do everyone still alive in the town?”\n\nHe shook his head.  “No, just a percentage need to be dosed.  According to this map, back in 2014 the town’s population was about 9,000 people.  From what we’ve seen and been told, I’d guess that less than 2,000 of those are probably still alive.  If we dose ten percent of that number, we should be safe by 200 or so.”\n\nI groaned.  “Fuck.  That’ll take all night.”\n\nHolliman shrugged and gave a hard smile.  “Do you have other plans?”  He snorted.  “Besides, I found a gymnasium three blocks over.  It looks like some of the townspeople were hiding there before they got infected and fell asleep.”\n \nGraves had been putting her bottle of Elixir back in its satchel, but she paused and looked up now.  “How many are in there?”\n\nHolliman didn’t meet her eyes, but instead looked back down the way he’d came.  “Alive?  Hard to say for sure.  There are a few dead in there too.  But if I had to guess, it’s close to a hundred.”\n\nShe glanced at me and nodded.  “Okay then.  Let’s go.”\n\n**** \n\nThe outside of the gymnasium proudly proclaimed itself to be “Home of the Braxton Barbarians”—A name that was ironically apt given everything that had happened there.  Bodies and signs of long-past fighting littered the parking lot as we made our way toward the building.  We found a couple of sleepers amid the chaos, but most were truly dead here.\n\nThe carnage got much worse as we reached the double doors leading into the gym.  A couple of dozen bodies lay in a jumbled pile of slow rot at the entry point.  I could see several holes that were probably gunshots on a number of the people, and the outside of the doors were streaked with bloody finger trails and dents, along with one long breach of the metal from a fire axe that was still lodged in the right door.\n\nGagging a little, I had to fight the urge to just close my eyes and block it all out.  “Jesus.  It was like a war here.  They were trying to get in to the others, weren’t they?”\n\nHolliman puffed out a breath and nodded.  “Yes, it looks that way.  For whatever reason, some people weren’t affected as quickly as others.  Maybe they tried to leave town and couldn’t, or maybe by the time they realized how bad things were, all they could do was try to hide in here.”  Stepping over a dead teenaged girl, he yanked open the door with a squeal.  “They chained the door from the inside, but they left a gap to shoot through.  I found some bolt cutters at a hardware store back the way we came and took care of the chain, but we still probably want to block this door open when we go in.”  He gave me a weary glance.  “Don’t want to be trapped in there if things go sour.”\n\nGraves touched Holliman’s shoulder.  “Do you think it’s dangerous in there?”\n\nHe shrugged but didn’t turn to look at her.  “Dangerous?  Yes.  They all seem asleep though.  And this whole place is dangerous.  The quicker we can get done, the less risk we have of running into something unexpected and nasty.”  Pulling out a small flashlight, he stepped inside and we followed.\n\nThe first room was a large atrium with two sets of double doors on the far side leading into the gym proper.  Spare chairs and tables had been piled against another exterior door down at the far end, and clustered around that pile were two men and a woman, all alive and twitching from down in the belly of some deep dream.\n\nGraves gestured to them.  “We may as well get these before we venture inside.”\n\nHolliman frowned but nodded.  “Yes, I suppose so.  But let’s hurry.”\n\nFive minutes later, the three were all truly asleep and we were stepping into the gymnasium.  The murk of the faint fading daylight coming in through the few grimy windows gave an illusion of normalcy at first.  There were a few signs of what were probably discarded makeshift weapons, but no bodies or slumbering people at first.  It wasn’t until our lights reached the far corner of the gym that we saw the enormous mound of flesh that lay dreaming.\n\n“Oh my God.”  Graves’ voice trembled slightly as she took a few steps forward to get a better look.  “They…they’re sleeping amid the dead, aren’t they?  Did they…did they choose to do that?  To sleep in that?”\n\nHolliman nodded.  “I think so.  The putrification is oddly slow in this place, and these people were likely all insane when they fell asleep, so I suppose it made some sense to them.”\n\nMy own voice was barely above a whisper when I spoke.  “Who are the dead people?  In here, why did some die and some live?”\n\nGraves spoke up.  “My guess is that not everyone got infected or turned at the same rate.  The ones that were too slow or somehow immune to it got killed by the rest before…well, before being turned into bedding.”\n\nTears sprang to my eyes as the sudden urge to vomit overtook me.  Doubling over, I vomited onto the dirty edge of what had once been a basketball court.  Holliman patted my back.\n\n“I did the same thing earlier.  It’s for the best.  It’ll make what we have to do easier.”\n\nThroat burning, I gave him a sidelong glance.  “What’s that?”\n\n“We need to pull all the dreamers free of that so we can give them the Elixir.”\n\n**** \n\nAn hour later we had dislodged forty or so people from the hill of death and dreaming that occupied darkest part of the gym.  I’d vomited twice more—once when we pulled the first man free and again when we hit a pocket of firm dead flesh holding a pair of women tightly.  It should have been long withered away, but instead it was spongy and resistant to our attempts to yank the women out.  It took all three of us pulling at the first woman and kicking at the rotten mess around her to break her free, and when she came out, it was with a soft, liquid pop that filled the air with a foul smell that took my breath away.  We pulled her away quickly and then grabbed the second, but we were only a few feet away from the mound when I had to stop and retch again.  Wiping my mouth, I helped them slide her the rest of the way to where we had lined up the others on the far side of the gym.\n\n“We…why don’t we do this batch and then get more?”  I spit again, more to get the smell off my tongue than the bile from retching.  “I need a break from going into that.”\n\nGraves looked at the pile and then at the twitching bodies we had laid out across the gym floor.  “I think we’re less than halfway done with what’s in there, but this is a good starting point.  We can move them into the front room when we’re done to make room for the rest.”  She looked at Holliman.  “Sound good to you?”\n\nHe nodded.  “Yes.  Let’s just hurry.  It’ll be dark soon.”\n\n**** \n\nWe were halfway done with the first batch when it happened.  At the time, I was too terrified to consider the why of it all, and looking back on it later I just chalked it up to our being tired and in the routine of doing the same strange and horrible task over and over.  And I guess that was my first mistake—it *wasn’t* exactly the same thing over and over.  Because with every person we took from dreaming, the others grew more restless.\n\nI think we all realized this was building towards something bad, but our wordless agreement was just to work faster.  Get it over with so we could somehow finish whatever was happening in this town and get out.  I think about that attitude now and ironically enough, I marvel at it.  I had no real idea of what we were facing or how we were supposed to beat it, but through some amalgam of desperate faith in Holliman and Graves and desperation at our situation, I trusted that it would work out so long as we had a plan and kept to it.  That’s probably why, when Graves cried out and shoved me off the man I was steadying for the Elixir, there was no fear, just irritated surprise.\n\nIt all happened so fast.  She shoved me, I turned toward her even as I saw a blur of movement from behind.  Someone small with a piece of metal or a knife, stabbing the air where I had been and hitting Mrs. Graves’ arm instead.  She let out a scream and reached for the attacker’s wrist even as I was catching myself and trying to regain my balance so I could help.\n\nThe air was suddenly split by the crack of a gunshot, and the small boy holding a butcher knife went tumbling back a couple of feet before sliding a few more.  My eyes followed him first—I could already see blood pooling from his chest and even at a distance it was easy to tell he was dead in the moment before I turned to look for the source of the gunfire.\n\nIt was Mr. Holliman, his eyes wide and roving as he looked around the gym and then at Mrs. Graves, his shocked expression narrowing to one of angry concern.\n\n“Gracie?  Are you okay?”\n\nShe was cradling her arm and looked pale, but she managed to nod between deep, panicked breaths.  “I…yes, I think so.”  She gave him a smile before looking over at me.  “Are you okay?”\n\n“I’m fine, thanks to…”\n\n“Ha.”\n\n“Hee hee.”\n\n“Ha ha ha HA!”\n\nIt wasn’t the laughter of one person or just a few.  In fact, at first it seemed less like laughter than it did trickles of dirty water, crawling through new cracks in a dam, growing more eager and numerous with every second.  I looked toward the dark corner of the room and saw what was crawling towards us wasn’t foul streams but madness given legs and hands and teeth—dozens of dreamers now woken back into whatever plague held this place.  Crawling and standing with the rotting muck of their family and friends clinging to their bodies as they picked up left behind weapons and started to stand and walk towards us, every lip curled into a smile between chuckles and cackles and guffaws.\n\n“Ha ha.”\n\n“Hee hee heeeeee!”\n\nI turned to look at Holliman as he was stepping forward to lift Mrs. Graves to her feet and pull her toward the exit.  He gave me a silent glance that told me all I needed to know.\n\nThis was not according to plan.  This was not in control.  \n\n[And if we didn’t get away from this place and these people, we were all going to die.](https://redd.it/10h9jfw)",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11lfzci/i_got_lost_in_the_woods_when_i_was_nine_years_old/)\n\nThe dream I had that night was the same as the first. I was trapped in an endless loop in those woods, eventually stalked by an unseen creature, and I woke up after it caught me. \n\nI woke up with a scream, to be specific. \n\nMy mother came rushing in. \n\n“What’s wrong Baby?” Yes, I was still called her Baby at nine, no that would not change with any number of years thereafter. \n\n“I was still in the woods!” I wailed. I couldn’t think of a better way to say it. I still can’t. \n\n“It’s okay, Baby. You’re not in the woods. You’re home.” She tried to comfort me, pulling me into a tight hug. “What happened in there? Was there anybody else in there with you?”\n\n“No. Not people. Just the thing. But I couldn’t see it.” \n\nA few years later, I would come to understand the significance behind her attempt to gently prod out if a human attacker was the source of my unusually traumatized reaction. \n\nInstead, my answer seemed to leave her still concerned but mostly placated that it was just an unusually strong nightmare.\n\nLife continued as normal for a while. I never fully forgot the incident. But, it’s hard for even something pretty bad to fully keep a nine year old down.\n\nI do think it made me even more of an introvert, just more distance between me and the world. It wasn’t huge, certainly. I would say I was basically normal, and the nightmares were gone, I hoped for good. \n\nThat wasn’t to be.\n\nThe next incident happened months later. School had let out and come back again. I have never been responsible about switching my schedule around and planning around getting a good night's sleep.\n\nOne night, just after going back to school from summer break, I got determined to push through winning a video game. I had been floundering on the final fight for days. So, it was time to set in and do it. \n\nThose digital cambion twins humiliated me for hours, and hours more. By the time I finished, it was so far past late that the moment I crawled into bed, literally the very next moment the alarm went off pulling me up. \n\nI’m sure you don’t even need to imagine how exhausted I was. At that age, it wasn’t the constant dragging aches and exhaustion I feel now. I mostly could still pull through the day, but with fits of sleepiness hitting at the most unexpected moments. \n\nThat was what got me.\n\nI was sitting in one of my classes. Not so surprisingly, I couldn’t possibly tell you which subject it was. What I know is that only a few minutes in, I passed out. \n\nI didn’t even need to open my eyes. I smelled the rotting leaves. I felt the dirt encrusting my body. I was in my own personal hell yet again. \n\nI was in the woods. \n\nIt is hard for me to put the emotions I felt at that moment to words. The sheer existential dread that shook my body was devastating. I knew, in the deepest parts of my soul, that I had always been there. No matter how many months passed, I had never left those woods. \n\nEventually, I pushed myself up and looked around. I didn’t need to look at myself to know that I was the same age, in the same clothes as I was then. I mean that not just because it made sense. No, somehow I was the same child who had gotten lost in those woods. The time since was the hazy and indistinct part. \n\nI tried to reject that nightmare. I kept my eyes clenched shut. I cried until I had no tears left to shed. But the woods never changed. \n\nEventually, I stood up and walked. Resigned, but still terrified, I made no attempt to keep or choose any path. I knew it didn’t matter. I just needed to endure whatever the forest had in store for me. \n\nThe woods became dark much faster than before. It was as if it knew that it needed to change how it would torment me as I no longer held hope of just walking out. \n\nThe trees oppressively narrowed around me, trapping me tightly in what was almost a maze. Eventually, I could only follow the paths which split and formed ahead of me as the trees were so grown together that I could not push off-course even if I wanted to. \n\nThe way the trees transformed into a great wall of wooden flesh unsettled me. Branch veins and leaf hair blended into a hellish picture on the canvas of nature. \n\nI heard it coming. \n\nThe rustling of leaves came first. Then I could make out the stomping of feet. \n\nI ran. You have to remember, I was still a child, not meaningfully older than when I first found those woods. How was I supposed to deal with that? Panic pushed me forward. I knew well enough from last time that it could cause pain. \n\nThe forest canopy above me melted into blackness. The wall of trees looked like a stretched sheet of wooden skin. Only the forest floor remained oddly normal. \n\nA stench like burnt skin assaulted my nose. I could sense it getting near me. This time, it didn’t grab me in one fell swoop like before. Instead, many hands raked across my back and arms, weakly grasping me. I continued to struggle to run, but gradually the hands pulled me to the ground. \n\nThrashing and screaming, I struggled to break free of their grasp…\n\n-\n\nI fell out of my desk. \n\nEvery set of eyes in that classroom was on me. As far as anyone watching could see, I had just shrieked and flung myself out of my desk. \n\n“What’s wrong?” Being in elementary school, the question was far more concerned than annoyed. \n\n“Where-?” Slowly, the memory of where I actually was came back to me. \n\n“Come on. You’re going to see the nurse.”\n\nI was promptly taken away. Understandably, the teacher wanted to offload the problem before a room full of elementary children went out of control.\n\nI did actually explain my problem to the nurse. That got me an appointment with counselors. I would have loved it if an adult could have given me answers. \n\nInstead, after thorough questioning about my home life, I got my mother called about my “nightmare problem” and nothing more to show for it.\n\nI knew my problems ran deeper though. These were not dreams. Having another incident so far detached from my trip into that forest made me certain of it. \n\nI shouldn’t have been capable of feeling every sensation, seeing every detail, and thinking with total clarity in a dream. No dream feels that real. \n\nThat incident left me with no ability to pretend that this was a single freak accident. Something had happened in those woods, and it wasn’t going to just leave me behind. \n\nI was too young to do anything about it though. I felt powerless. So I did what I had to: I lived with it.",

        "text": "\"H-hello?\" My eight-year-old voice trembled, “Is this emergency services?” \n\n“It *sure* is!” the cheerful male voice on the other end of the phone line answered. “What’s the trouble, young man?” \n\nI frowned. *‘Young man?’*  Weren’t they supposed to say *‘9-1-1, what’s your emergency?!’* \n\nMaybe it was his first day. Either way, there was no time to waste.\n\n“Something’s wrong with my mom. She fell down all of a sudden.” I pressed the phone to my ear and leaned back. My mother lay where she’d collapsed just minutes ago. \n\n“Oh *no!* That’s too bad! Someone will be over right away.” *Click.* \n\nI dropped the phone and crept over to my mother. The faint rise and fall of her chest was the only way I even knew she was alive. *Wait…I hadn’t told the ambulance people our address!* \n\nI ran back to the phone and dialed 9-1-1 again.\n\n“151 Cliffmore Way! 151 Cliffmore Way!” I shouted into the receiver, then hung up. I shut my eyes tight. I wanted to scream, to shatter into a million pieces like the glass that had fallen from my mother’s grasp just before she collapsed–\n\nBut all I could do was wait, hold her hand, and pray.\n\nIt felt like an eternity before the doorbell rang. I sprang to my feet, but froze when I turned the corner. A short, brown-haired white man was peering through the window with a grin on his face. He rang the bell again, more instantly this time, and I noticed he wore a red nurse’s uniform. I left out a sigh of relief. *The ambulance people were here. Everything was going to be okay.*  I yanked the door open.\n\n“Hello there, young man!” The smiling man exclaimed. I read the name *‘Marbas’* on his nametag, right beside the pens and stethoscope. “Where’s the *un-*lucky lady?” he asked.\n\n“You mean my mom?” I stammered: “S-she’s in here…” \n\nTwo expressionless assistants in identical red uniforms rolled a guernsey to where my mother lay, surrounded by shards of glittering glass. \n\n“Up, up, and away!” Nurse Marbas rubbed his hands together excitedly while my mother was loaded into the guernsey and rolled out the door. A jolt of helpless fear shot through me: *they were taking my mother away!*\n\n“Uh, mister? Can I ride with my mom to the hospital?” I asked the smiling man. \n\n“Hospital?” Nurse Marbas wrinkled his forehead, confused. “Oh, there’s no need for that. We’re *professionals,* you see.”\n\nAs the assistants loaded my mother into the back of the black ambulance, I looked over their shoulders at the sharp and jagged tools hanging from its walls. They weren’t like any medical instruments that *I’d* ever seen.\n\n“We’ll take *excellent* care of your mother,” the smiling man went on, “and call *as soon as* you can see her!” \n\nNurse Marbas leapt into the rear compartment, his expressionless assistants climbed into the cab, and the black ambulance began to back out of the driveway.\n\nI ran behind it, waving my hands. I wanted to yell at them to stop, but I was just a kid: who was *I* to contradict the *professionals?* \n\nI was still standing there five minutes later, when flashing red-and-blue lights came skidding around the street corner. The two police officers muttered into their radios and looked worriedly at the scene in front of them: a crying child, a wide-open door.\n\n“Did you call 9-1-1?” a blonde policewoman asked.\n\n“I did,” I nodded, “but they already came. They took my mom away.” \n\nThe two police officers looked at each other.\n\n“I’m afraid that’s not possible. We received a call from this location–a child shouting an address–and we’re the first ones to respond…”\n\nIt’s been twenty years since the black ambulance drove off with my mother. \n\nI never learned what became of her, or of the strange nurses in the red uniforms. My foster parents said I made it all up. *Trauma,* they said. I had to forget, move on.\n\nBut around midnight last night, I received a strange phone call. \n\nA woman’s gravelly, rasping voice–almost inaudible over the screams and crackling flames in the background. A voice I recognized:\n\n*“They told me that I could call…we’re going to be together again soon…son.”*   \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

        "text": "My name is Carrisa, I'm a 23-year-old, I'm studying at Central university, my university is far from city, so I board a train to go there, it usually takes me 3-4 hours to get there, and I return at midnight. I hate university if I have to be honest. It's not just that I'm lonely, It's a weird building overall. Something always seems off about it, I don't trust those high rising towers, bricked by dirty yellow and covered in cobwebs and dust. \n\nIt is the middle of January and the nights have grown longer and colder. I came back from my last lecture and ran into an old group of friends, we chatted a while and I lost track of time. By the time I reached the station it was pitch black, Not many people around, It felt eerie. Only because the station was really lively when it was early. \n\nI boarded the train, The section I sat in had only 2 other people, A young blonde woman with a baby, She seemed to have these *uncanny doll-ish eyes*. They seemed too *fake* but too animated to be fake. I noticed her blinks were off-beat but then I realized I shouldn't stare. The other person was a brunette man, he wore a mask and his hair covered his eyes partially, He seemed to be young too, He had a large bag in his hand. I sat down and put my head against the glass, slowly dozing off as I felt the train moving.   \n\n\n*CLICK . CLICK . CLICK*  \n\n\nA noise disturbed my sleep, I opened my eyes to a pitch black train and a freezing atmosphere, I realized I fell asleep and I started to panic '*Am I stuck ?' 'How do I get out ?'..* I stood up trying to understand how to get out of here. I walked around and found a door to the panel, I pushed it open, And to my surprise it opened with possibly the most annoying scraping sound ever, like the ones the doors make at night but only more *screech-ey*.   \n\n\nI stepped outside, jumping from the stairs, It was pitch black, The scene was still, No lights, no person, Nothing. Only a mechanical buzzing from the train, I turned around to have a look, The train seemed so much weirder, It had rust all over it and it seemed like it hadn't been used, And I began to panic a lot. I turned around again, I don't know what I expected, It felt *unreal, eerie, weird,* I felt like pinching myself, It felt like a dream. I kicked hard on the ground, I picked up a rock and hit myself with it a couple of times out of frustration.   \n\n\nIt was real, It was all real. I don't know how or why but it was. I stumbled around, I didn't want to go anywhere away from the train, But maybe I was just on another station ? Maybe I was only a bit far away from my home, So with the decision I walked along the train-tracks, My eyes adjusted to the dark well and I was able to make out bushes, trees, a grassland and the scene seemed to continue from there, It was all the same, *bushes, trees, grassland. bushes, trees, grassland.* And the same train track I followed. No lights, No houses, No animals, No humans, No sign of any life from anywhere. Just pitch black darkness, the same never ending scene and the train behind me.   \n\n\nI walked for a while and the more I gazed into the same scene, the more I became anxious. There was no sign of any life from anywhere, How had the train ended up here ? I brushed off the questions and thought maybe it would be better to stay beside the train until morning. I also realized I had forgotten my bag, I might have some battery left in my phone. So I walked back, my eyes pierced into the darkness and my anxiety made me frantically run back. I stepped inside the train panel, And grabbed my bag, I found my phone and checked the time '*3:33'* It was really late. I dialed the emergency number. '***The service is out of order, Please try again*** ***~~l~~******at******~~er-r-r-errr'~~*** *click.* I guess I had no hope now, I had the only choice of hiding here until it's morning. And then suddenly I heard whistling.  \n\n\n*It was loud, Very loud, It seemed to echo around the place, And it was creepy enough for a sane person to whistle so loudly in the dead of night.* But I went outside, To feed my curiosity, But as they say, *'Curiosity kills the cat'.* I looked around, The whistling stopped, I stumbled across the train tracks, behind the train, But nothing. And then I heard the whistle.  \n\n\n***Behind me.***  \n\n\nI turned around, And what I saw, I cannot describe but what I can is what I felt, I felt like gouging my eyes out and smashing my head, I felt my hair stand up, I didn't take a moment to stop and run back into the train, I stumbled around the panels and sat down under a seat, And hid as best I could. The whistling grew louder, I hated it, I wanted it to end. But It didn't, It found me and the last thing I saw was its sick, *terrifying*, twisted grin, laced with its blood and flesh. *I wish It was a dream.*",

        "text": "When I was growing up, I was never afraid of the dark. I never feared the dark spaces under my bed, the gloom in the closet, the one corner of the basement that the light never seemed to reach. I didn’t get scared of the knocks on the walls, the groaning of our old house settling, or the odd scraping noises outside my room at night. Even a slight flutter or tapping on my window wasn’t spooky to me, and I could sleep comfortably through the night. That all comes from spending your whole childhood in a haunted house, I guess. When my room would be rearranged by an unseen force, I’d just clean it up. When cups flew across the room, I’d catch them. Eventually, I started responding to the actions, even giving my “friends” names. It wasn’t uncommon in my early teen years for my mom to hear “Don’t even THINK about it, Darryl” as a cup would start to slide across the table. So, I’d never been afraid of the supernatural. I believe in monsters, but I never used to be afraid of them. They all had to just be misunderstood and lonely, like me, right?\n\nRight?\n\nMy favorite place on our property was the Knoll. A little bump of a hill at the edge of the cornfield where the woods came closest to the house. It was a good 500 feet from the barnyard, but still far enough that I could get some space and some quiet. The trees in this part of the woods were tall, far taller than the trees that covered the rest of our woodlot. Their canopies blocked out some of the sun, and their needles made the ground soft, perfect for sitting and relaxing with a thermos of cocoa and a book on an early fall afternoon, before the snow hit. It was always easy to find a place to lean, as these ancient trees had long ago lost their lower limbs, and the forest here felt like a gothic cathedral. High, vaulted pillars, the partial twilight even during the day, with small bursts of light breaking through the canopy. Even the singing of the birds or the rustling of mice was like a symphony of its own. I may have lived in the house, but I lived FOR the woods. Especially my little part of it. \n\nMy parents always taught me to come back before sunset, not to whistle, and to NEVER follow if anyone was calling my name. I never questioned these rules. I grew up with them, after all. Mom and Dad never cared if I went to the Knoll, but they wanted to make sure that I was safe. I was always happy to oblige, knowing full well that if I broke these rules, I’d be grounded, and stuck inside. Even when the birds sang, I never whistled back when I was in the forest, no matter what.\n\nBy now, I’m assuming you’ve gathered that I grew up in Appalachia. Rural, lonely, isolated. Surrounded by the supernatural, raised in it, so it was second nature. I guess I can thank my deeply superstitious grandmother for that. After all, it kept me alive. I can’t say the same for everyone else. \n\nBy the time I was in early high school, my parents were getting tired of the commute. After all, it was about an hour’s drive to the nearest town, there was no cable, and the power to the house was always dicey, because squirrels would short out the transformer on the power pole about once a week. They were considering moving, and I was looking forward to not waking up at 5 am for school. They’d bought a new house in town, and we were preparing to move. We’d packed anything that wasn’t necessary and had already moved it into the new house. But Mom and Dad decided to have one last house party before we threw the beds and suitcases we’d been living out of into the moving truck and finally finished the move. They invited friends, coworkers, and their kids. Many of these families were from out of town. They didn’t know the rules, and certainly thought we were all superstitious hicks. I wish I could say that we were just superstitious. \n\nThe party started in the early afternoon, on the last beautiful day in late August. The sun was shining bright, there was just enough wind to keep the bugs at bay, and everyone was basking in this truly gorgeous day. The younger kids were playing with my brothers. The older kids were with me, watching movies inside and generally being anti-social teenagers. Eventually, the heat in the house drove us out into the late afternoon sun, and I began to give the tour of the property I begrudgingly agreed to hours prior. The older kids were generally polite as I showed them around. Except for Cassie.\n\nCassie wasn’t from around here, and she liked to remind EVERYONE about that. Cassie’s family moved out to the “middle of nowhere” because her father was offered a really good job, and in a town with a low cost of living and a decent salary, they decided to relocate. Cassie had made it clear from the start that she hated everything about this new town, including everybody in it. The most interesting thing about Cassie was probably that she’d never gone in the woods around here, and she was DESPERATE to go for a “hike” in the woods. In retrospect, I never should have taken her. I should have accepted being grounded for refusing to be hospitable. But hindsight is 20/20, I guess. \n\nAfter the cajoling, pleading, threatening, and eventual blackmail from Cassie, I backed down and offered to show her the Knoll. I told her that a hike was out of the question after dark because the sun would be setting soon, and we shouldn’t be in the woods after dark. Despite her sneering at the “superstitious backwoods idiot,” I refused to give in. I knew for a FACT that the woods weren’t safe at night. Once the sun sets, the shadows change, you can lose your way in the dark, and nocturnal predators like bobcats can hunt you silently through the brush. I was NOT willing to risk it.\n\nI told my mother where I was taking the group of older kids. She looked me in the eyes and told me very firmly to make sure they all follow the rules. Especially the whistling. Under NO circumstance should ANY of us whistle in the trees. I promised to go over the rules before we left. When I was returning to the group, Cassie began mocking me for having to “check with my mommy” before we went out for a walk. I just ignored her and turned to the group.\n\n“Ok guys, there are a couple of rules before we head out. Pretty sure most of you know them, but I just need to make sure we’re all on the same page. First, stick together. Second, we will be back in the barnyard by sunset. This is not negotiable. Third, under NO circumstances are you allowed to whistle once we leave the yard. And lastly, if you hear ANYONE calling your name, we’re all leaving the woods. IMMEDIATELY. Understood?” \n\nAll the locals nodded understandingly. Cassie rolled her eyes. I turned and started walking towards the Knoll, followed by the older kids, including Cassie. She ran up to me and started to ask me the questions I had been dreading.\n\n“The others won’t tell me why the rules exist. They’re pretty stupid if they don’t have a reason. I mean, are the woods really that different at night.” \n\nI stopped dead in my tracks. I turned to her, grabbed her by the shoulders, and looked deep into her eyes. Her normally dismissive expression turned almost fearful when I began to speak.\n\n“Cassie. The woods are different at night. They completely change. And the other rules are there to make sure you don’t get lost in a strange place or attract some type of predator. There are coyotes, bobcats, and God knows what else in the woods. For once in your life, shut up and listen. Please.” \n\nThe blood drained from Cassie’s face, and she nodded. I turned back to the Knoll and kept walking. I hoped that maybe, just maybe, she would listen for once. The Knoll was just ahead, a calm sanctuary after the craziness of the party that day. When we stepped into the shade of the ancient trees, the temperature was noticeably cooler, and the slight wind made the great giants sway gently, and produced a sound like creaking timber and a faraway whisper as it ran through the needles above us. The others looked up into the canopy, then found a place to sit and relax. I was starting to relax, my back against my favorite tree, when Cassie came up to me. \n\n“Hey, um, is the whispering in the trees normal? It sounds like my name.”\n\n“Cassie, it’s just the wind. Seriously, you need to relax. YOU were the one who wanted to come out here, remember?” I answered, trying to sound relaxed, but on the inside, I started to get a bit nervous. \n\nCassie was silent for a few moments after that, and I could see her starting to relax out of the corner of my eye. I started to allow myself to calm slightly, listening to the sound of the wind in the trees. Just as I was starting to think everything was going to be ok, Cassie turned to look deeper into the woods. She was staring intently into the gloomy trees, as if she was hearing something come from the woods. Suddenly, I had an awful feeling in the pit of my stomach. I looked over at the others, who had also noticed the difference in Cassie’s behaviour, and it was beginning to make them uneasy too. We all stood up, walking over to where Cassie was sitting. It was like she was hypnotized, or paralyzed, staring off into the shadowy trees. There was no sound other than the wind. No birds, none of the usual forest sounds. Out of nowhere, Cassie let out a loud whistle. I grabbed her hard by the arm, snapping her out of her trance. Realizing what she’d done, and seeing the fear in my eyes, she made to run.\n\n“No. Do NOT run. If we’re being hunted, we walk quickly, but we never run. That will trigger the prey drive of WHATEVER is out there, and that’s the last thing we want. Let’s go.” I said in a low whisper to her and the other kids, barely audible over the now much stronger wind. \n\nWe made for the safety of the house, battling against the wind that had picked up since we entered the trees. It was gusting and felt like it was trying to drive us back into the woods. The dust from the barnyard stung our faces as we made our way across the field, moving slowly despite our efforts. I refused to look back at the woods, instead focusing on the adults, who were suddenly rushing to get everything inside. A tablecloth blew off one of the picnic tables and flew right by us, looking every bit like a ghost as it whipped past us towards the woods. I followed it with my eyes as it flew towards the Knoll. I froze in my tracks. The woods looked different. Somehow changed. As if the place I had known all my childhood was darker, stranger, almost evil. I knew it wasn’t possible, but I thought I heard a growl come from behind me as I stared. The impossible noise snapped me out of my stupor. I turned and began to sprint the last 100 yards towards the house.\n\n“RUN!” I screamed as I caught up to the group. We all broke into a dead sprint.\n\nMy mother was in the barnyard when we all came flying through the gate. She tried to stop us, but we wouldn’t stop out all-out flight until we’d gotten through the main door of the house. As the rest of our group was catching their breath, my mum took me aside. I told her everything that happened, and she immediately looked afraid. Her expression darkened when rain began to patter against the window. \n\nThe local kids and their parents left, leaving only my family and Cassie’s in the house. My parents had previously offered for them to stay the night, as they lived the farthest from our house, about an hour and a half drive one way. Cassie’s family, not used to driving such long distances, would have been nervous in even perfect weather, let alone the thunderstorm that had blown in suddenly. My parents did everything they could to keep us all distracted from what was going on outside, and it was working for everyone except for Cassie. She kept staring out into the darkness in the direction of the Knoll every time the wind would whistle past the window. It was almost like she kept hearing her name every time the wind blew. I tried my best to relax and calm Cassie down. Eventually, by bedtime, she’d relaxed enough to lie down on the air mattress we had set up in our guest room. Knowing that she was safe in the house with her parents allowed me to finally fall asleep.\n\nAt about 1 am, I woke up to the sound of the guest room door opening, which was unusual, seeing as I was used to things going “bump” in the night. I got up immediately, putting on my slippers and stepping out into the hallway, just as the top of Cassie’s head disappeared down the stairs. She was muttering that she could hear something calling her, and she had to go. I woke my parents up, and then ran down the stairs as I heard the front door creak open. My father followed me down the stairs while my mother woke her parents. As Dad and I ran out the open door into the storm, we saw Cassie walking, entranced, towards the gate out of the barnyard. We shouted and tried to follow, but the wind seemed to whip our voices away. Cassie’s mother and father spilled out into the yard, shouting for their daughter to snap out of it. If she heard them, she didn’t respond. The gate, which had been chained shut blew wide, allowing her out of the relative safety of the barnyard and into the open field beyond. A bolt of lightning split the sky, and we saw the silhouette of a figure right in front of Cassie. It was pitch black, easily standing 10 feet tall, with impossibly long arms and legs. Its hands were narrow, fingers long and spider-like. Dad and I froze as we watched a pitch-black hand wrap around Cassie. She didn’t wriggle, didn’t protest as it lifted her into the air. I heard Cassie’s mother scream her name, and suddenly, Cassie was gone. It was like, in the blink of an eye, whatever held Cassie had vanished back into whatever realm she’d summoned it from and taken her with it. \n\nWe called the police, and they came in the morning after the storm. They said that the storm must have washed away her tracks, and that she must have been sleepwalking. We moved out of the house the same day. While Cassie’s disappearance made local news, it never became a national story. I haven’t even seen her disappearance being discussed on internet forums or true crime podcasts. Cassie’s parents were never the same. They moved away after the case went cold. I think about what happened to Cassie almost every night, when the formerly comforting dark descends on me like a wet blanket. I no longer think that monsters are just misunderstood. I’m afraid of the dark, and I haven’t set foot in the woods since.",

I feel the misty morning breeze push my hair back as i pedal my bike into town.\n\nThe night before i had stayed up all night on LSD, writing poetry in my journal beside my loud tv, playing History Channel shows.\n\nI enter the town shopping center, including a Walmart, A thrift shop, and Dollar Tree.\n\nI kick my bike against the wall of the store and head on in. They’ve just opened so the store is empty.\n\n“Hey!” I shout as i enter the store. A worker groans back in response.\n\nI walk to the back of the store to get candy, when i see an old white-bearded man squating in the corner.\n\nHe wears wizard robes, purple, with big yellow stars lining the stitching.\n\n“Here, boy.” Says the old man in a deep and crackly voice.\n\n“Sup, dude.” I reply. \n“What are you doing back here?”\n\nHe started patting his beard with both hands as his eyes bulged wide open. He did a sort of robot-dance while he stared at the ceiling in front of me.\n\n“Dude. Like. The fuck.” I said.\n\n“Yes, yes friend. Come closer.” He directed his eyes at my face as his dancing intensified.\n\n“You are the chosen one, boy. Reach your hand into my left pant pocket, now yes.”\n\nHe took a step towards me while i stood in silence, grabbing my hand and shoving it against his junk, and then his pocket.\n\n“Mmm yes, boy. Grab the magical fruits from within… mm.” \n\nAt this point i begun questioning if i had somehow died on the bikeride here and i am now in some kind of eternal limbo.\n\nI grabbed hold of something in his pocket and quickly took my hand back out from his cloak.\n\nIt was brown mushrooms.\n\n“Mmm yes, you have gathered the most succulent fruits from my package. Now you must eat them if you wish to take your place as the lord of the shrooms, boy.”\n\nHe grabbed my penis through my jeans and i lurched back in fear.\n\n“How did you get in here before the place opened?”\nI asked\n\n“Mmm take the mushrooms, child. I, uh. Work here”\nHe said as he peered over my shoulder and down the aisle at the workers.\n\nI lifted the shrooms to my mouth and ate the entire 15 grams.\n\n“Ohhhhhhh yesssss, boy. You will certainly be the king of the shrooms now. That is a higher dose than I’ve taken in 22 years!!! Hahaha” \n\nThe old man grabbed his balls and danced around as the shrooms took immediate affect.\n\nThe ground began shaking violently from left to right, i threw up, and fell to my knees while my vision became overwhelming.\n\nI fall nearly unconcious as i hear the old man from within\n\n“Yee ha, yee hey. \nThe one who trips, is the one who plays.\nYee ha, yee hey\nA twisted game, repercussions await.”\n\nI heard this about 62,000 times in a row, seeing literal waves of patterns and grids and flowing lights, i couldnt even feel my arms or legs.\n\nThats when i woke up in a bathtub with a massive hole sewn shut in my stomach, as i sit up the stiches break free and my stomach pours my intestines all over my legs in the bathtub. I cried as the shroom man entered again jn his purpke robes.\n\n“Thank you for the kidney, i wasnt gonna wait for a donation this time.”",

        "text": "I didn’t scream and didn't even feel like it because it was the least shocking development of the last fifteen minutes.\n\nMaybe if his eyes were turned toward me, rather than facing out into the darkness, it would have struck me more. When the Coast Guard cut him down later, I saw the whites of his eyes were blood red, the capillaries having exploded from the pressure of the belt around his neck.\n\nBut at that moment, he was just a dead guy. A dead guy who killed a former crew member, whose father had raped me in the stairwell of that parking garage. \n\n*His father.* \n\nThere was a noise behind me and it was the wheelhouse door opening. I turned slowly, expecting it to be Mac. It was Levi. With his fingers he made a gesture for me to come. “You don’t have to be worried,” he said. I wasn’t about to take his word for it.\n\n“I won’t let him hurt you. But it’s time to talk because there are things to be settled.”\n\n“I don’t want to talk, and I don’t want to settle anything,” I said. \n\n“He can’t hurt you,” Levi replied.\n\n“Can you…” I trailed off.\n\n“I can protect you. Come, because the time is growing short,” he said. \n\nHe turned and went back down into the berth. I stood there for a moment, not contemplating whether to follow but steeling myself for what was coming. \n\nI climbed down the ladder and Levi was sitting across from Mac. Mac had his head in his hands. When he heard me coming he looked up and his eyes were red. I was going to tell him about Billy, but I could tell he already knew.\n\nLevi patted the wooden bench a couple of times next to him. I sat. “Now. Why don’t you tell her why you did it?” Levi said to Mac.\n\nI managed to croak out a hushed “No,” but part of me wanted to hear. I had never reported it. I'd swallowed it whole, until it consumed me from the inside out. So I wanted to know, but I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of begging for it.\n\nMac shook his head and looked down at the water sloshing around the rock. “He made me,” he finally said. I knew who the he in question was. But Levi didn’t move, he stared straight ahead as he always seemed to in these moments.\n\n“He came to us one night when we were out here. And he told me that he needed someone to help him, and that someone was me. He said he needed a young woman and Billy chose you.” Mac stopped, swallowed hard. \n\nLevi looked at me and said that it was my turn. We all have to confess what we did. \"We need to make things square,\" he said. Of course I knew what he was talking about, so I started to confess because I knew I had to. I had to make things square.\n\nBefore I tell you what I said, there’s one thing I haven’t told you about that night in the stairwell. Mostly because the details were a little blurry, the brain blocking out trauma and all that. When I thought of “the incident” I didn’t actually remember Mac, well...entering me. \n\nWhat I do remember from that night was a pinch, something cold, hard, and plastic pushing into me. \n \n*************************\nMy friend Jackie bought a scratch ticket the weekend we were staying at her parents’ house while they were in Florida on vacation. We were buying cigarettes at the Cumberland Farms and she had a dollar in change leftover. \n\nShe squinted past the cashier and asked for a number eleven scratch ticket. It was the Moose Money ticket. You match three dollar amounts, you win that amount. You get a moose, you win all the prize amounts. \n\nWe stepped out into the parking lot and Jackie used the key to the house to scratch it off. The first one was $5,000. The next was $5,000. This is how they hook you and get you to keep playing. *I was so close to winning, I just needed to scratch off another $5,000. Give me three more Lucky 7’s.*\n\nThe next was $1,000. Then, the edge of the key kicked up the silver dust to reveal $10,000. Then another $10,000. The last one was probably going to be $1.00, as it invariably was. But as Jackie started to scratch I realized that what I thought was a dollar sign was the top of an antler. \n\nPass go and collect your winnings from the coffers of the Maine State Lottery. Twenty-one thousand cold ones, before taxes of course. We looked at each other and shrieked. \n\nRather than the eighths and tenths we usually bought, that night we splurged. I don’t’ remember how much H we got, but we used the ticket as collateral. Jackie would cash it the following Monday. You can’t just hand that one over at the store, you have to go to the lottery commission and get your picture taken with a giant check.\n\nSo we went back to the house and took a trip to the moon. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw Jackie passed out next to me on the couch. The scratcher was on the coffee table. \n\nI got up and went to the bathroom. I stared at myself in the mirror and hated what I saw. I opened the medicine cabinet and wasn’t exactly sure what I was looking for. Even when you’re high as fuck, you still have that urge to poke around in other people’s medicine cabinets. I did it many times when I broke into those camps around Sebago Lake. \n\nIt was staring back at me. Jackie’s mother was a diabetic and there was a bottle of insulin on the shelf. \n\n***\n\nI waited for Jackie to stir. When she came around I asked her if she wanted some more and she said yes. I gave her the needle that I had already prepped. I watched her tie off and inject it into her arm. Soon, she was back out. \n\nI didn’t wait around for the seizures to start. That’s what happens when a non-diabetic takes insulin. But it will kill you just as easily as fentanyl, and it doesn’t leave a trace. The coroner just assumes it’s an OD.\n\nJackie’s parents came home from Florida and found her the following Monday. That was the day I went to the lottery commission and cashed the ticket and got my picture taken with a big fucking check.\n\nSo now you know what I did, what my secret is. I killed a friend with a hotshot for $21,000, before taxes. I don’t blame it on the drugs. Or the fact that I was violated with a in the stairwell of a parking garage and inseminated. I take the blame. I killed her, and for that I will always be sorry.  But I know where I can shove my sorries.\n\nI buried the lede a bit here and I’m not just a junkie who broke into seasonal camps to feed my habit. So I don’t expect any sympathy for this and that’s not why I’m writing this down. \n\nWhen I finished telling the story to Mac and Levi, Mac tried to tell me it wasn’t my fault and I told him it was my fault because I was too weak. The same way it was his fault that he shoved that turkey baster inside of me and squeezed the bulb. \n\n***\nLevi told me that we were all square. Square with who, exactly was unsaid. He stood up and went toward the ladder. He started to climb up and Mac lunged for his leg. \n\nBut he was too slow. Or maybe it was that Levi was too fast. Because before Mac could get to him, Levi pounced down from the ladder, springing off of it like a gargoyle on a parapet that had been animated to life. \n\nMac was big and Levi was small but it didn’t matter. The force when Levi hit him in the chest knocked Mac back, slamming him onto the bottom of the boat, the back of his head smashing into the protruding rock. \n\nMac’s head made a sickening sound, like a cantaloupe being dropped from the third story onto the sidewalk. I was sure he was dead, but just to be sure, Levi took his hands and pounded Mac’s head back into the rock over and over and over.\n\nI didn’t scream and didn’t feel like it. I watched and felt something welling inside of me that felt like a laugh. But that didn’t come out either and it subsided.\n\nThe only thing I felt as I watched Levi kill him a hundred times over was a wet sensation in my underwear.\n\nI didn’t scream and didn't even feel like it because it was the least shocking development of the last fifteen minutes.\n\nMaybe if his eyes were turned toward me, rather than facing out into the darkness, it would have struck me more. When the Coast Guard cut him down later, I saw the whites of his eyes were blood red, the capillaries having exploded from the pressure of the belt around his neck.\n\nBut at that moment, he was just a dead guy. A dead guy who killed a former crew member, whose father had raped me in the stairwell of that parking garage. \n\nHis father. \n\nThere was a noise behind me and it was the wheelhouse door opening. I turned slowly, expecting it to be Mac. It was Levi. With his fingers he made a gesture for me to come. “You don’t have to be worried,” he said. I wasn’t about to take his word for it.\n\n“I won’t let him hurt you. But it’s time to talk because there are things to be settled.”\n\n“I don’t want to talk, and I don’t want to settle anything,” I said. \n\n“He can’t hurt you,” Levi replied.\n\n“Can you…” I trailed off.\n\n“Hurt you? I cannot. But I can protect you. Now please come, because the time is growing short,” he said. \n\nHe turned and went back down into the berth. I stood there for a moment, not contemplating whether to follow but steeling myself for what was coming. \n\nI climbed down the ladder and Levi was sitting across from Mac. Mac had his head in his hands. When he heard me coming he looked up and his eyes were red. I was going to tell him about Billy, but I could tell he already knew.\n\nLevi patted the wooden bench a couple of times next to him. I sat. “Now. Why don’t you tell her why you did it?” Levi said to Mac.\n\nI managed to croak out a hushed “No,” but part of me wanted to hear. I had never reported it. I'd swallowed it whole, until it consumed me from the inside out. So I wanted to know, but I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of begging for it.\n\nMac shook his head and looked down at the water sloshing around the rock. “He made me,” he finally said. I knew who the he in question was. But Levi didn’t move, he stared straight ahead as he always seemed to in these moments.\n\n“He came to us one night when we were out here. And he told me that he needed someone to help him, and that someone was me. He said he needed a young woman and Billy chose you.” Mac stopped, swallowed hard. \n\nLevi looked at me and said that it was my turn. We all have to confess what we did. \"We need to make things square,\" he said. Of course I knew what he was talking about, so I started to confess because I knew I had to. I had to make things square.\n\nBefore I tell you what I said, there’s one thing I haven’t told you about that night in the stairwell. Mostly because the details were a little blurry, the brain blocking out trauma and all that. When I thought of “the incident” I didn’t actually remember Mac, well...entering me. \n\nWhat I do remember from that night was a pinch, something cold, hard, and plastic pushing into me. \n \n*************************\nMy friend Jackie bought a scratch ticket the weekend we were staying at her parents’ house while they were in Florida on vacation. We were buying cigarettes at the Cumberland Farms and she had a dollar in change leftover. \n\nShe squinted past the cashier and asked for a number eleven scratch ticket. It was the Moose Money ticket. You match three dollar amounts, you win that amount. You get a moose, you win all the prize amounts. \n\nWe stepped out into the parking lot and Jackie used the key to the house to scratch it off. The first one was $5,000. The next was $5,000. This is how they hook you and get you to keep playing. I was so close to winning, I just needed to scratch off another $5,000. Give me three more Lucky 7’s.\n\nThe next was $1,000. Then, the edge of the key kicked up the silver dust to reveal $10,000. Then another $10,000. The last one was probably going to be $1.00, as it invariably was. But as Jackie started to scratch I realized that what I thought was a dollar sign was the top of an antler. \n\nPass go and collect your winnings from the coffers of the Maine State Lottery. Twenty-one thousand cold ones, before taxes of course. We looked at each other and shrieked. \n\nRather than the eighths and tenths we usually bought, that night we splurged. I don’t’ remember how much H we got, but we used the ticket as collateral. Jackie would cash it the following Monday. You can’t just hand that one over at the store, you have to go to the lottery commission and get your picture taken with a giant check.\n\nSo we went back to the house and took a trip to the moon. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw Jackie passed out next to me on the couch. The scratcher was on the coffee table. \n\nI got up and went to the bathroom. I stared at myself in the mirror and hated what I saw. I opened the medicine cabinet and wasn’t exactly sure what I was looking for. Even when you’re high as fuck, you still have that urge to poke around in other people’s medicine cabinets. I did it many times when I broke into those camps around Sebago Lake. \n\nIt was staring back at me. Jackie’s mother was a diabetic and there was a bottle of insulin on the shelf. \n\n***\n\nI waited for Jackie to stir. When she came around I asked her if she wanted some more and she said yes. I gave her the needle that I had already prepped. I watched her tie off and inject it into her arm. Soon, she was back out. \n\nI didn’t wait around for the seizures to start. That’s what happens when a non-diabetic takes insulin. But it will kill you just as easily as fentanyl, and it doesn’t leave a trace. The coroner just assumes it’s an OD.\n\nJackie’s parents came home from Florida and found her the following Monday. That was the day I went to the lottery commission and cashed the ticket and got my picture taken with a big fucking check.\n\nSo now you know what I did, what my secret is. I killed a friend with a hotshot for $21,000, before taxes. I don’t blame it on the drugs. Or the fact that I was violated with a in the stairwell of a parking garage and inseminated. I take the blame. I killed her, and for that I will always be sorry.  But I know where I can shove my sorries.\n\nI buried the lede a bit here and I’m not just a junkie who broke into seasonal camps to feed my habit. So I don’t expect any sympathy for this and that’s not why I’m writing this down. \n\nWhen I finished telling the story to Mac and Levi, Mac tried to tell me it wasn’t my fault and I told him it was my fault because I was too weak. The same way it was his fault that he shoved that turkey baster inside of me and squeezed the bulb. \n\n***\nLevi told me that we were all square. Square with who, exactly was unsaid. He stood up and went toward the ladder. He started to climb up and Mac lunged for his leg. \n\nBut he was too slow. Or maybe it was that Levi was too fast. Because before Mac could get to him, Levi pounced down from the ladder, springing off of it like a gargoyle on a parapet that had been animated to life. \n\nMac was big and Levi was small but it didn’t matter. The force when Levi hit him in the chest knocked Mac back, slamming him onto the bottom of the boat, the back of his head smashing into the protruding rock. \n\nMac’s head made a sickening sound, like a cantaloupe being dropped from the third story onto the sidewalk. I was sure he was dead, but just to be sure, Levi took his hands and pounded Mac’s head back into the rock over and over and over.\n\nI didn’t scream and didn’t feel like it. I watched and felt something welling inside of me that felt like a laugh. But that didn’t come out either and it subsided.\n\nThe only thing I felt as I watched Levi kill him a hundred times over was a wet sensation in my underwear.\n\nPart 1:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11hbtps/i_work_on_a_lobster_boat_and_we_pulled_something/",

One day the ground was empty and bare, and the next, this monstrosity of nature stood at full height, adorned with [blood red leaves.](https://www.reddit.com/user/tropical_rabbit/comments/11m2vpf/the_tree_with_blood_red_leaves/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) At least that's what my friend Chrissy had thought.\n\nChrissy and I had been friends since elementary school when she moved in next door to me. We quickly became friends through our shared love of the outdoors and telling scary stories. Everyone always thought that we would end up together, but there were never any romantic feelings between us. She was like a sister to me and I was like a brother to her.\n\nWe lived in a small town about an hour or so away from Mt. Pleasant. There weren't many stores or restaurants, but there was a lot of farmland and woods. Our summers were spent hiking through the woods and building forts with downed trees and broken branches. In the fall we would go apple picking and venture through corn mazes. Chrissy loved watching the leaves change colors and always had an interest in nature. Most of our classmates moved away after graduation, but she and I stayed. I worked at my parents' bookstore and eventually inherited it when they sadly passed away. Chrissy started a landscaping company and became an expert arborist. We would meet for lunch regularly and go for hikes in the woods, reminiscing about our childhood adventures. \n\nOne day, while I was looking for new books to order, I heard the bell chime from the door to my shop. It was Chrissy. I quickly noticed something was wrong when she didn't have the usual smile on her face. \n\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" I asked before she said anything. I hadn't seen her in about a week, which was a long time for us.\n\n\"I'm not quite sure,\" she said. \"Have you seen Mr. Roberts lately?\"\n\nMr. Roberts was the pharmacist at the drug store in town. He would come in every so often for some children's books for his grandkids, but I hadn't seen him in a while.\n\n\"Not recently,\" I said.\n\n\"I went in to get the prescription for my mom and he was just standing there, not moving at all. It caught me off guard so I waited for a minute and then called to him when he still didn't move. He turned and glared at me and then yelled at me to leave him alone. I was speechless because he's always been so kind and friendly.\" \n\n\"Wow, that's crazy,\" I said. \"What did you do?\"\n\n\"He apologized and said he hadn't been sleeping well. Then he got the medicine and handed it to me without saying anything else. Something was definitely off in his face…he had this really sad look and I almost said something but he walked away from the counter.\"\n\nWhile she was telling me more about what happened, the phone rang. It was Gary's mom. She said he wouldn't be in today. Gary was a high school student that helped me in the bookstore a few days a week. I told her that I hope he feels better soon and hung up.\n\n\"That's not the only weird thing that has happened,\" she said. \"My crew had just started cutting the grass at one of our customer's houses when he chased them away with hedge clippers. They told me he was yelling incoherently at them. When they got in the truck, they called the police while they drove away. They went back for the equipment when they saw the police car coming.\"\n\n\"Wow, I'm glad your workers didn't get hurt,\" I said. \"What happened to your customer?\"\n\n\"I don't think they caught him yet, he must've run away before the police car got there,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope they catch him,\" I said. \n\n\"Me too,\" she said. \"I'm thinking about going for a walk in the park to destress a bit…want to come with me?\"\n\n\"I really need to finish this new order of books and I don't have Gary's help today so I'll have to pass,\" I said.\n\n\"No worries, I'll catch you next time,\" she said before turning around and heading out the door.\n\nI went back to my book order, restocked some shelves, and helped a few customers before it was closing time.\n\nAfter straightening up the store and shutting off the lights, I went out into the cold winter night, locking the door behind me. My store was just at the edge of the small downtown area, which was never very busy during the winter months. In the summer and fall though, we'd get some tourists and there would be a lot more activity at night.\n\nI walked around back to the parking lot, where only my car was parked. It had been a mild winter so far, but tonight, the air was freezing. My eyes watered as I made my way to my car. I got in, started it up, and turned the heat on full blast. I'd probably be home anyway before it got warm.\n\nMy headlights illuminated the empty field behind the parking lot and I slammed on the brakes as I turned. I saw something out in the middle of the field. I figured it was probably just an animal but I wanted to be sure. Putting the car in reverse, I watched as the lights moved across the field as I turned. I stopped again when I saw it. There was a man standing there with no clothes. It was fifteen degrees out and with the wind-chill, it had to be in the negatives.\n\nI called 9-1-1 and told them about the man and where I was. While I waited for the ambulance and police, I got out of my car and yelled to the man. He turned his head to look at me for a moment before turning back and facing the woods at the end of the field.\n\nThe police car was the first to arrive. I told the officer that I was leaving work and found him standing out there. She grabbed a blanket from her car and started walking towards the man. \n\n\"Sir, are you all right?\" she yelled. When he didn't respond, she shouted again to him. \"I'm going to help you. Can you please come over here?\" \n\nThe ambulance pulled in next and drove through the parking lot and out into the field closer to the man. \n\nThe officer stopped a few feet away from the man and began talking to him in a calm voice. I couldn't tell what she was saying, but I could tell that the man was still looking away from her. She wrapped the blanket around his shoulders while the EMTs got the stretcher out of the back of the ambulance. \n\nOne of the EMTs took the man's arm and tried to pull him toward the stretcher.\n\nThe man threw the towel off and shouted, \"No, no, no! I have to stay here! It won't let me leave! I can't go!\"\n\n\"Get the sedative,\" one of the EMTs shouted. \n\nThe other one ran back to the ambulance and then returned back with the others. The three of them worked together to get the man on the stretcher. With a lot of effort, they were able to strap him into it while he continued to scream and shout. \n\nAfter they finally got him loaded in the ambulance, they took off with their lights flashing and sirens blaring.\n\nI waited for the officer to return back to her car. \"Do you think he'll be okay?\" I asked.\n\n\"He was in pretty bad shape,\" she said, shaking her head. \"Thanks for calling this in.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" I said and got into my car and drove home.\n\nThe next morning, I stopped in the drug store for some snacks to keep at work. No one was at the front register, but I heard yelling coming from the back of the store where the pharmacy was located. \n\nI walked down the make-up aisle toward the source of the yelling. Mr. Roberts was shouting at the cashier, Jenna, who was crying. When Mr. Roberts noticed me, he stopped and walked through the door in the back of the pharmacy and out of sight.\n\n\"What happened?\" I asked her.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said as she wiped the tears from her eyes. \"All I did was ask him who was coming in today. He makes the schedule and usually lets me know who is working  I've never seen him like that.\"\n\n\"My friend said he was mean to her the other day too. I wonder what is going on with him,\" I said. \"Maybe you should talk to your manager when she comes in.\"\n\n\"I think I will,\" she said. \"I'll just stay away from him until my shift is over.\"\n\nShe walked back toward the front and I was about to go to the snack aisle when I heard a door open. I turned around to see Mr. Roberts walking back into the pharmacy area with a smile on his face.\n\n\"Good morning, Ken,\" he said to me.\n\n\"Good morning…is everything okay?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is a beautiful day,\" he said. \"Do you need anything?\"\n\n\"Uh, no thanks,\" I said, surprised by his quick change in demeanor.\n\n\"Have a great day,\" he said.\n\nI hesitated for a moment before saying, \"Don't you think you should apologize to Jenna?\"\n\nHe was an older man, but he was an intimidating figure…plus the pharmacy was a step up from the floor I was standing on, making him look like he was towering over me. However, I still felt I had to say something.\n\nHe took a step closer and his smile went away as he glared at me. \"Have a great day,\" he said.\n\nI didn't think it would help to try and say anything else so I walked over to the snack aisle. I turned back before I went down the aisle and saw that he was still glaring at me.\n\nI paid for my snacks and wished Jenna good luck on getting through the day.\n\nIt was a slow Sunday at the bookstore so I wasn't concerned when Gary's mom called in sick for him again. It was a short day anyway with closing time being at five o'clock.\n\nI heard sirens a few times during the day and saw flashing lights speed by my windows. There was the occasional emergency around here, but it was odd to have three in a short time frame. \n\nJust before closing time, Chrissy came through the door. \n\n\"Hey Chrissy,\" I said. \"Do you want to grab a bite at the Village after I close up?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that sounds good,\" she said, her voice sounding tired and without the usual pep.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yeah…I'm fine. I just didn't sleep well last night,\" she said.\n\nThe door opened behind us and Chrissy jumped and appeared startled.\n\nIt was the police officer from last night. \n\n\"How can I help you?\" I asked.\n\n\"I was wondering if you knew who that man was last night. He had no ID or any belongings near him and we don't know who he is.\"\n\n\"I didn't really get a good look at him so I'm not sure,\" I said.\n\n\"It isn't looking too good for him and he isn't able to communicate. The frostbite is severe and they are not sure if he's going to make it so we'd like to notify his family,\" she said. \"I'm going to search around our back to see if he left his clothes or anything nearby.\"\n\n\"Good luck,\" I said.\n\nI followed her to the door and locked it after she left.\n\nWhen I turned around, Chrissy was standing there with her mouth hung open and her eyes wide. \"What happened?\" Chrissy asked.\n\n\"There was someone out back last night. I noticed him when I was driving through the parking lot. I tried to get his attention but he wouldn't move so I called 9-1-1,\" I said.\n\n\"And he had nothing on? It was freezing last night…and so windy!\" she said.\n\n\"Nothing at all and they had to force him in the ambulance. He was yelling something about not being able to leave,\" I said.\n\n\"We can't leave,\" she said.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\nShe stared off for a moment and mumbled something before saying, \"Oh, nothing…it's nothing. Let's just go get a bite to eat.\"\n\nShe still had this weird look on her face, but didn't seem to want to talk at the moment.\n\nWe closed up the shop together and then walked the two blocks to the Village Cafe. There were a few tables full, but it wasn't too busy overall.\n\n\"Hey Chrissy and Ken, sit wherever you'd like and I'll be right with you,\" said Emily as she delivered plates of food to one of her tables.\n\n\"Take your time,\" said Chrissy.\n\nWe went to a booth by the front windows and sat down. Neither of us needed to look at a menu; we knew it by heart. There weren't many restaurant options in town. I ordered the fish and chips and Chrissy just got a cup of broccoli cheese soup and a decaf coffee.\n\n\"I'm not that hungry,\" she said.\n\n\"You've got me worried,\" I said. \"What's going on?\"\n\nShe took a big drink of water and then said, \"Last night I dreamt of something similar to what happened to you yesterday.\"\n\n\"With the naked man?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, but it didn't happen the same way,\" she said. \n\nEmily came back and dropped off the coffee. \"Your food will be up shortly,\" she said with a smile.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Chrissy.\n\nShe added some cream and sugar, stirred it up, and then took a sip before telling me about her dream.\n\n\"I was walking through the woods and kept hearing whispers all around me. It was night but still bright out from the moon. I heard someone talking and came across a naked man. He was talking loudly but I couldn't understand any of the words he was saying. When he turned to face me, his nose was missing and his skin was pale and white. Then he said that it wants something from us and we cannot leave. Then he went back to his unintelligible ramblings.\"\n\n\"Wow, that is weird,\" I said. \"Did you wake up after that?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said as she stirred her coffee some more. \"I saw something glowing nearby through the bushes and was drawn to it. It was a lot like the strange tree I saw yesterday on my walk, but seemed more alive. The leaves were blood red and let off a soft glow and the branches and exposed roots slithered slowly like snakes.\"\n\n\"You saw that tree yesterday? With red leaves?\" I asked.\n\nEmily came by again with our food and a refill of coffee. \"Enjoy,\" she said. \"Let me know if you need anything else.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\nI wasn't ready to eat yet, I was enthralled by her story.\n\n\"Yes. I went on my usual walk through the trail in the woods but veered off somewhere without even realizing it. I eventually came to this tree with bright red leaves. It stood out because, of course, all the other trees lost their leaves a few months ago.\" She continued to sip on her coffee, but neither of us ate.\n\nEmily walked over again, \"How is every…oh, looks like you haven't even tried it yet. You must be having a juicy conversation.\" She leaned over the table and whispered, \"Is it about Mr. Roberts?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"But what happened with him? He's been acting strange lately.\"\n\n\"You're telling me!\" she exclaimed. Then she looked around to make sure no one was around and spoke quietly. \"He was in this morning by himself and sat at that booth way in the back. Him and his wife are always here together on Sunday mornings. When I asked where the missus was, he said that it was none of my business. I didn't like how it felt when he was looking me in the eyes, he looked so full of hatred. I was caught so off guard, he's been the nicest man ever since I've known him.\"\n\n\"He's been yelling at people in the drugstore too,\" I said. \n\n\"He also just stared straight the whole time he ate…it just gave me the creeps,\" she said. \"Maybe someone needs to check on them. That's not like him at all.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" said Chrissy.\n\n\"Well, I better get back to my other tables,\" said Emily. \"Let me know if you have any other juicy gossip!\"\n\nI finally took a few bites of my fish and Chrissy ate her soup.\n\nWhen we were finished eating, I wanted to hear more about the tree she found. \"What happened when you found the tree? Do you know what kind it was?\"\n\n\"That's another weird thing about it,\" she said. It didn't look like any of the trees I've ever seen in Michigan before. It had some characteristics of a black walnut tree, but the leaves were differently shaped and there were no walnuts or shells around the tree.\"\n\n\"And I thought you were the great tree expert,\" I said, teasing her a little.\n\nShe smiled and I'm glad that lightened the mood a bit. \"I'm determined to figure it out, though,\" she said. \"I felt like I lost my sense of time when I was looking at it. All of a sudden I was freezing and shivering even though it was a little warmer than usual with the sun out. When I snapped out of whatever it was, I pulled off a leaf so I could research it. To continue with the strangeness of the tree, it was really hard to pull the leaf off. I actually had to use both hands and really pull.\"\n\n\"Did you figure anything out with the leaf yet?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, I had a headache before going to bed and have been too tired today to look into it,\" she said. \"I'm going to look through my books and online tomorrow to see if I can find anything on it.\"\n\n\"Well, let me know what you find out,\" I said.\n\nWe paid the bill and walked back to our cars at the bookstore. When we got to the parking lot, Chrissy took a few steps past her car and seemed to be staring towards the woods.\n\n\"Do you see something out there? Don't tell me it's another naked man,\" I said.\n\nChrissy didn't respond and remained still.\n\n\"Hey!\" I shouted. \"Chrissy, are you okay?\"\n\nWhen she still didn't respond, I ran over to her. She was whispering something under her breath that I couldn't make out. \n\nI grabbed her arm and said, \"Chrissy, what are you…\"\n\nShe turned around to face me, her eyes wide and darting back and forth. \"We cannot leave!\" she shouted loudly enough to scare some nearby birds into flight.\n\nI grabbed both of her arms and shook her. \"Chrissy, what the hell is going on?\"\n\nShe blinked rapidly a few times before focusing her eyes on me. \"I thought I heard something out there,\" she said, looking back towards the woods. \"Did you hear it?\"\n\n\"All I heard was you whispering and then shouting,\" I said.\n\nShe gave me a weird look. \"I wasn't talking,\" she said. \"I was trying to hear if it was talking to me again.\"\n\n\"You don't remember shouting?\" I said.\"Wait, wait, wait…if it talks to you again? What are you talking about?\"\n\nShe glanced back at the woods before looking back at me. \"Nothing. It's nothing. I'm fine,\" she said in her normal calm voice.\n\n\"You don't seem fine,\" I said.\n\n\"I'm just tired from barely sleeping last night. Honest, I'm fine,\" she said.\n\n\"Let me at least take you back to your place. I'll drive you back to your car in the morning,\" I said.\n\n\"You don't need to. I'll be done,\" she said.\n\n\"Hey, you would do the same if it was me acting all strange,\" I said.\n\n\"Alright fine,\" she relented.\n\nShe locked her car and climbed into the passenger seat of mine. We drove in silence to her house. I wanted to know what was going on with her, but she wouldn't open up.\n\nWhen we got to her house, I walked her inside through the front door, immediately noticing how dark it was in the house. Except for a faint glow coming from the kitchen.\n\nI was about to ask her about it, but she turned on the lights, making the glow disappear. \n\n \"I'm going to get changed and lie down,\" she said.\n\n\"Do you want me to stay over?\" I asked. \"I don't mind sleeping on the couch out here.\"\n\n\"That would be nice. It has been a strange couple of days,\" she said.\n\nChrissy went to bed and I stayed up for a little while watching TV. Once I started getting tired, I turned off the lights and went over to the couch, but stopped when I saw that glow again. \n\nI walked into the kitchen and on the counter was the red leaf Chrissy had told me about. It was on a paper towel on top of the counter. It looked smooth and leathery and I had a sudden urge to pick it up and rub it all over my face. I started reaching for it but stopped and jumped when I heard Chrissy behind me.\n\n\"Hey, didn't mean to startle you…just getting a drink of water\" she said. She saw me looking at the leaf. \"It's beautiful isn't it. I wouldn't touch it though. It leaves a red dye on your hands that is hard to wash off.\"\n\nAfter she got her water, she went back down the hall to her bedroom. I looked at the leaf for a little while longer, mesmerized by it, before going back to the couch.\n\nI woke up screaming at the top of my lungs and jumped out of the couch, quickly looking around me. It took me a moment, but I was able to calm down once I realized I was safely in Chrissy's house.\n\nI sat back down on the couch and thought about the vivid dream I just had. It started off in Chrissy’s house. In the dream, I woke up and saw the bright glow in the kitchen again. I went in there and the leaf was slowly moving, like waves were going through it. The paper towel was soaked in blood red liquid and it was dripping onto the floor, leaving a huge puddle. I picked up the leaf and rubbed it all over me, feeling the liquid on any exposed skin. I covered my eyes with it and when I let go, I found myself standing in the woods directly in front of the tree that looked exactly like Chrissy had described. Its leaves were glowing a deep, eerie red, and seemed to be moving even though the air around her was still.\n\nThere was whispering all around me, but I didn’t see anyone. As I stood there staring at the tree, strange noises began to join the whispers. It was like something was moving through the underbrush, making its way towards me. The sounds were getting closer, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me. The leaves and sticks on the ground moved into the air as if some unseen force was surging through them. Then, all of a sudden, it stopped and I felt a warm blast of air on my face. I closed my eyes and when I opened them again, I was standing in a clearing in the woods. The tree was gone. Raindrops began falling from the sky, leaving red marks on my clothes and body. I looked around and saw an ax on the ground in front of me, the red rain making it look like it was stained with blood.\n\nAs I bent over to pick it up, I heard someone yelling behind me. Turning around with the ax in my hands, I saw the naked man I had seen the night before. He was yelling gibberish and his face was deformed from the frostbite. His nose was missing like in Chrissy’s dream and his eyes were wide and wild. I didn’t want to, but I walked over to him with the ax held high. He held out his arms, one ending in a stump and the other missing most of its fingers. I brought the ax done and heard a sickening crunch as it went into his shoulder. The man screamed and continued his yelling but didn’t put up a fight while I continued striking him with the ax until he was a bloody heap on the forest floor. Then I felt a smile form across my lips just before I woke up screaming.\n\nOnce I was able to calm down a little, I called out for Chrissy. There was no response so I walked down the hall to her bedroom. The door was wide open and the covers were bunched at the bottom of the bed. She wasn’t there. I called out to her again and began looking around her house. When I got to the front hall, I saw that the front door was partly ajar. My car was still in the driveway and hers was at the bookstore so she had to have taken off on foot. I noticed that the footprints in the snow leading away from the porch looked like they were made from bare feet as there were none of the usual shoe or boot markings.",

        "text": "“Mum’s birthday’s later this week but since I haven’t been up to see her for a while then I thought I’d go down early and stay with them for a week or so. I know you’re really busy with work at the moment so I’m not expecting you to suddenly be able to take time off, I’m just going to go down myself and either you can join me for the party or if you’re really swamped then I’ll meet you when I come back up.”\n\n[After what I’d read on Robin’s phone last night](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/115l2ms/anna_plays_the_cello_part_1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I knew I couldn’t stay in the house. Nothing I’d told her had been a lie exactly, my mum’s birthday really was at the end of the week and whilst spending a week with my parents for a birthday was unusual I did usually see her on her birthday, just not for quite that long. Robin had always encouraged me to see or talk to my parents more often, perhaps due to the fact she had no contact with her own. I was really hoping that fact would make this story slip down more smoothly. I silently begged my wife to accept my excuse to leave as she frowned in thought.\n\n“I could probably see about getting stuff moved around at work so I can come down with you instead.” she said after a while.\n\n*No.*\n\n“Honestly, if there’s a chance you could rearrange things so that you have a little time off work then I’d prefer you to do it after we’re back. I think spending so much time here by myself is getting to me a bit so if I could have time being around my parents alone and then come back to the house for time with you then that’d be better for me than if you came with me but then I had to be completely by myself.”\n\nThe lies fell out of me with such astounding ease that I was almost alarmed. I’ve never really been much of a liar but I’d snared Robin quite well here – in order to follow me now she’d have to admit she was fine with me spending time alone or that her work wasn’t as busy as she’d said.\n\n“If you’re sure.” she said eventually and I smiled.\n\n“I think I’ll head off later today. Let me know if you’re coming to the party or not, they’re always happy to see you but I’m sure they’ll understand if you can’t make it.”\n\n“Wouldn’t miss it.” Robin replied and I went upstairs to pack.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWhen I finally pulled into the town I’d grown up in, my parents’ house wasn’t my first stop. I tried to collect my thoughts briefly as I sat in my car and then with a quick whisper of ‘fuck it’ gave up trying to plan the conversation and just knocked on his door.\n\n“Amy?” Sam asked but then quickly swept me up into a hug. “Amy! I didn’t realise you were about!”\n\nOnce my feet had returned to the floor I smiled back at him and we went inside. He made me tea but instead of drinking it I found myself tapping the side of the mug anxiously whilst we made small talk.\n\n“Still too hot?” he asked after a while and I realised that I’d be lucky if the tea was even warm at this point.\n\nI stared at the faded cartoon character on the side of the blue mug and tried to figure out how to broach the subject.\n\n“Hey, are you okay?” Sam asked and for some reason that was enough to get me to talk.\n\n“I think I might be going crazy.” I said all at once.\n\nSam didn’t react beyond switching his smile to a thoughtful expression.  \n\n“Robin isn’t going into work. I thought she was cheating on me and I checked her phone and, god that makes me sound like such an insecure bitch, but the messages were really strange. They weren’t sexy or anything – it was like she was on some sort of weird spy assignment keeping tabs on me. They sounded really, really stalkerish. But I haven’t done *anything* weird or exciting or important. And I feel like I’ve been forgetting things and I keep having all of these weird nightmares.”\n\nI stopped as abruptly as I’d started and picked up the tea in front of me. I tried to drink some but my throat wouldn’t cooperate and though I wasn’t looking up I could feel Sam’s eyes on me.\n\n“That sounds like a lot,” he said after some time, “and yeah, it doesn’t make a huge amount of sense. So let’s start with Robin – what made you think she doesn’t go to work anymore?”\n\n“I saw her.” I said then added, “Oh, I actually might be able to prove that. I put a tracker on her car.”\n\n“Seriously?” Sam asked with raised eyebrows.\n\n“I mean, she’s texting with someone about keeping an eye on me and eliminating me if I remember too much. I just haven’t checked on it yet.”\n\nI pulled the leaflet out of my bag and started to type in in my phone when Sam stopped me.\n\n“Don’t.” he said. “If something weird is going on then she’d be stupid not to be tracking what you’re doing on your phone. Use mine.”\n\nHe pulled his phone out of his pocket and I looked at him carefully before taking it.\n\n“You believe me?”\n\nSam shrugged and pulled my mug away to clean it.\n\n“I don’t necessarily think you’re being stalked by spies so committed that they’d actually marry you so they can keep a closer watch, no. And a lot of things you’ve said aren’t making much sense. But there are other reasons someone would put software like that on their wife’s phone and if you actually have gone a little crazy then, well you don’t seem like somebody who’d snap for no reason.”\n\nI looked up my wife’s car and showed Sam the screen. She hadn’t used it all day.\n\n“Okay. And she was definitely meant to be going to work today?”\n\nI nodded vehemently and suddenly felt so dizzy I had to grab onto the counter beside me.\n\n“Whoa!” Sam said as he grabbed me. “You okay?”\n\nIt took me a moment before my dizziness subsided enough for me to even nod.\n\n“I haven’t been sleeping well.” I said.\n\nMy phone buzzed and I expected it to be from Robin but to my surprise it was a text from my mum asking if I was okay and saying she thought I’d be there by now.\n\n“I didn’t tell her I was coming…” I said quietly.\n\nSam looked at me and then the text and sighed.\n\n“Right, okay. Where are your car keys? I’ll drive. I don’t want your mum worrying but if you drive like this then *I’ll* worry and you don’t want that, right?”\n\nI handed the keys over wordlessly and away we went.\n\n“Hi!” Sam yelled as he walked me into my parents’ house.\n\n“Is she okay?” I heard my mum ask before I’d even walked through the door and I knew something was wrong.\n\nIt wasn’t even slightly unusual for me to see Sam whilst I was in the area. It also wasn’t that odd for me to stretch the drive up to my parents out for longer than it needed to be if I stopped for food or decided to see a friend first or even once got distracted by signs for a car boot sale. It made no sense for her first reaction upon seeing me a little late with a friend to be concern.\n\n“I have to take my things upstairs.” I mumbled.\n\nSam and my mum talked in hushed voices behind me as I headed upstairs. I almost fell onto my bed and realised how exhausted I was, only to be disturbed by a knock on the bedroom door.\n\n“I brought your things up.” Sam said after I’d told him to come in. “Your mum said that Robin had messaged her and told her to let her know if you were behaving oddly at all. Said she was worried about you. Does she have a reason to be worried?”\n\nI shook my head.  \n\n“All she knows is that I had nightmares and couldn’t remember being in a band when I was younger.”\n\nThe bed was so soft and I could feel myself sinking away. I knew this conversation was important and yet I didn’t care about it at all. I felt the mattress sink slightly as Sam sat down next to me.\n\n“If there is extra stuff but you don’t want to tell me then you can just say so, that’s fine. Or you can tel someone else, want me to see if Cass is free to come and chat with you tonight?”\n\nSam loved me and loved solving puzzles, and here I was presenting him with a mystery that was holding my entire wellbeing in the balance. How could he resist?\n\n“I don’t mind. Tell whoever.”\n\nThe mattress shifted again as Sam stood back up to leave.\n\n“Sam?” I asked before he could leave, “Is she really going to kill me?”\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n“How can she?” he said finally. “She isn’t here. And if she comes for you then she’d have to get through me first.”\n\nI assume he left after saying that but my eyes had been closing even as he spoke and I found myself falling asleep as soon as he’d finished speaking.\n\nAnd with sleep came a dream.\n\n\\------\n\nIt was Anna again because of course it was. She was playing the cello with frantic passion in a dark room but it was just the same three notes over and over again. There were tiny, almost inaudible changes between each repetition but it wasn’t a song I recognised. It wasn’t really a song at all.\n\nI moved closer towards her and only then did I get a chance to see the expression in her face. She wasn’t passionate, she was terrified. But something about what she was doing made it so important that she wasn’t going to stop. I didn’t understand and in this dream Anna seemed completely unable to see me.\n\n“Anna?” I asked but a loud bang cut me off.\n\nThere was a window behind me like in a recording studio and it was beginning to crack. It looked like it’d been shot. Anna had been unable to see me but she could see *this* and she continued her mission of repeating the sequence of notes over and over whilst more gunshots on the other side of the window decorated it with spiderwebs of weaknesses.\n\n*This didn’t happen, but something almost like it did,* I realised, with no idea what had drawn me to that conclusion.\n\nThe glass shattered spectacularly and I heard Anna cry out. I wanted and needed to know who was terrifying her so much but before I could do anything Anna moved her bow away from her instrument and drew it sharply across her throat. Bows aren’t sharp but dreams don’t care so the cut she made was deep and fatal. I ran to help her before realising it was futile and then turned to see who was coming in through the window.\n\nBut before I could, I woke up.\n\n\\-----\n\nMy parents were both being far too cautiously nice to me when I woke up. It’s not that they aren’t usually nice people – they are. They let Sam stay here for an entire month when his parents kicked him out and helped me navigate dealing with Cass in the dramatic year after her bipolar had developed but before she’d even entertained the idea of seeking treatment. I didn’t spend as much time with them as I should out of a strong desire to appear more independent but for large sections of my life I’d felt like I could tell them almost anything and they’d be able to take it in their stride.\n\nIt was the *cautiousness* rather than the niceness that let me know something was up. I don’t know what Robin had told them but it was enough that I didn’t feel I could even begin to talk to either of them about my recent concerns about how weird my life had suddenly got without them reporting it back. And why wouldn’t they? I’d been nothing but positive about Robin to them ever since I’d met her and whenever they’d met Robin had always represented herself flawlessly. So instead of discussing my concerns about Robin to my worried parents I acted as happy and normal as I could manage and then used them to investigate the other area of my life’s recent strangeness.\n\n“Weird question – my friend was complaining to me that her daughter’s barely talked to her since she started uni even though they haven’t fallen out. But isn’t that kind of normal? I honestly can’t remember how much we talked once I started my course, did I go quiet?”\n\nThere was no such friend but I was hoping that by talking about how much or little I’d been in contact with them during university I could segue the conversation over towards exactly what it was I’d told them about. My dad thought about it.\n\n“You were actually pretty chatty during your first year. You were quieter after that though, you said your workload had gone up. We only really got the occasional email from you then, and most of those were song recommendations. I think it’s pretty normal though, yeah.”\n\nI moved the conversation onto other things to project my alarmingly false appearance of sanity but after ten minutes of chatting asked if I could borrow dad’s laptop for a bit. My phone might be being tracked but Robin hadn’t even seen the laptop dad bought last month, there is no way she could be tracking anything on it.\n\nI found emails from the years I’d been at uni. Dad was right, they were mostly song recommendations. Not just to him either, I’d emailed them to Mum, Sam and Cass as well. Some looked normal and it wasn’t as though recommending songs to people was something I hadn’t done before or since but some of them didn’t quite fit. Recommending a dance track to Cass was so out of place it was almost hilarious and sending Sam a link to a classical instrumental piece was just as unlikely to be appreciated. The text of the email itself was strange too – recommending which bar and even notes they listen out for.\n\n“Hey, check this song out!” one of these emails said with a youtube link to the song in question, “I’m really loving it recently, honestly the piano notes on the third bar alone were enough to make me realise why it was at number one.”\n\nThat didn’t make sense. The song in question was indeed one I loved but the notes in question weren’t necessarily my favourite and far more glaringly obvious was the fact that that song had *never* been at number one. Not here, not anywhere. It’d been popular, sure, but it just hadn’t done quite well enough. And if I knew that now then I’d certainly known it back then when it’d only been out two or three weeks.\n\nI opened up the email to Sam titled “Classical piece you might like” and read the body text of that. Just like the other I suggested he listen to specific notes by a specific instrument but I also said the song was “kind of like Beethoven’s Fifth” I listened to it and I didn’t understand why I would’ve said that. Not only did it not really have many similarities with Beethoven’s Fifth at all but to compare a single five minute song to entire symphony to someone who didn’t even listen to classical music at all was ludicrous. Then I finally got to the bar I’d told Sam to listen out for the start of.\n\nIt was a cello solo. And it started with the same notes that Anna had played in my dream.\n\nI’d been leaving myself clues, or possibly Anna had from my account and they were so cryptic that one or both of us must have been convinced that our emails were being watched. But why just random snippets of music? And why couldn’t I remember any of it?\n\nI read every email but it was only after reading six of them that I noticed a pattern. Each one not only had references to a specific section of a song, it also had another cardinal or ordinal number elsewhere. “Beethoven’s Fifth,” “Number One” or even slightly more hidden ones like “The second I heard it I wanted to talk to someone about it.” The emails were telling me how to arrange a song. A fairly short one and a chaotically discordant one, particularly if I was supposed to keep the notes attached to their assigned instruments, but a song nonetheless. I still had no idea why I’d sent myself instructions for a song but I pirated some software that would allow me to stitch all this music into my frankensong and hopefully isolate instruments when required, then plugged in my headphones and got to work.\n\nIt took hours and every time I listened to a slightly more complete version of the song my chest got tighter. A large part of me felt that hearing that song in full would explain everything and yet a tiny part of me truly didn’t want to know. Every single note made me more convinced that Anna and I had been involved in something terrible and had done something we could never take back. Warm tears seeped down my face as I continued to work until finally I was done.\n\nI almost didn’t press play. But in the end I needed to know.\n\nMemories flooded over me – incomplete and out of order. I realised that I knew the woman that Robin had been texting. I realised that the reason Anna and I had taken such bizarre precautions was that we’d known that our lives and minds were in danger. Perhaps most importantly, I realised why a song had been enough to bring all of these memories back to me.\n\nIt was because once upon a time Anna and I had helped our psychology professor create a song that could delete memories even more thoroughly than this song had managed to return them.\n\nThat someone smart enough to create a song that could delete memories would also be smart enough to delete the memories of the people who’d worked for her wasn’t surprising. It wasn’t even all that surprising that she’d be willing to kill us if our memories came back. Even though I had nearly all of the information I’d been searching for I didn’t know where the Hell I was supposed to go from here but a buzzing sensation in my hoodie’s pocket alerted me to a far more pressing problem.\n\n“*They’ve accidentally overstaffed this week so it looks like I can come see you earlier after all,”* the text said, *“I’ll be there tomorrow evening.”*\n\nRobin had never before for in our entire relationship said that her company had too much staff in. Too little, frequently, but too many was unprecedented. Maybe my parents had said something that had made her see me as more as a threat or maybe she’d just decided that letting me stay out of her supervision was too risky but either way I had to figure out what the hell I was supposed to do about the woman who was willing to kill me.\n\nAnd I had under 24 hours to [decide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leavesandink/)",

        "text": " \n\nWelcome to Voices from the Unknown, we are here to explore the depths of terror and the unknown. We dive into the macabre, the unexplained, and the mysterious all in hopes of bringing you bone-chilling stories that will keep you looking over your shoulder long after you’ve finished reading. \n\nThanks to our staff here along with outside sources we have a special treat for our first post. We have managed to get our hands on an audio recording of a man who just might enjoy horror as much as us. So when he caught wind of a forest where people were vanishing without a trace he decided he had to go check it out himself. But when he didn’t show up for work the next day the authorities were alerted and a search began. To this day he is still considered a missing person, the only thing ever recovered was a small handheld camera that we have managed to get our hands on from our very talented outside contacts. Our tale today follows Jeremy Murphy, a horror enthusiast who ventures out into The Emerald Forest to see for himself if the tales he heard were true. \n\nWe have transcribed the audio and included notes here and there in order to really provide you the reader an idea of his situation that may not be mentioned by Jeremy directly. \n\nSo without further ado, let’s begin.\n\n“So, umm I don’t really know how to do this. Hi everyone, my name is Jeremy Murphy and I’ve made the journey up to The Emerald Forest. My goal for this trip is to attempt to uncover the mysteries surrounding these woods. To all the people who know anything about this place's haunting tales have most likely heard of The Hollow, which is my intended destination. I imagine it will probably take me roughly a day and a half to reach so I’ve come prepared to spend a few nights out here. That’s all for now, I’m gonna get goin. I’ll check in again later.”\n\n*Jeremy has arrived at one of the entrances to The Emerald Forest. He begins walking up the trail before he cuts the camera. When he turns it back on again he’s sitting on a rock eating a sandwich and looks noticeably winded.*\n\n“It turns out I may have underestimated how difficult hiking is. I’m sure a little break and some lunch will get me back on my feet. I guess while I’m stopped I can tell anyone who doesn’t know a little about the mysteries surrounding The Emerald Forest. I was first introduced to them by some friends I met online on a forum I like to frequent. The topic of missing people always grabs my interest. I know that’s not everyone's cup of tea, but me personally, I just can’t seem to get enough of that sort of thing.”\n\n*He pauses for a moment to take a few bites of his sandwich.*\n\n“So, this park was opened to the public in the 1950s and since then 32 people have just up and vanished with no bodies ever being recovered. Everyone is still considered a missing person. So, with this information, me and a few buddies decided to piece together a map showing what trails they took and where their last known locations were if any at all were found. You know things like campsites, clothing, or food wrappers. Anything that shows human activity basically. After we put this map together, we see that they all disappeared roughly around the same area. Well, at least the people where a trace of them was found. Based on our map we were able to determine a vague perimeter for the disappearances. They all seem to be focused in or around the place that has been dubbed The Hollow by my fellow internet sleuths. I think that’s enough for now, I need to finish eating so I can make it to my intended campsite before it gets dark. We’ll talk again when I hopefully get to my camp. Jeremy out.”\n\n*Jeremy sets the camera by his feet and turns it off. When he returns he is sitting propped at the base of what looks like a large fir tree. According to the timestamp from the video, it is almost five pm.*\n\n“Man are my feet gonna be sore tomorrow. I know I said we wouldn’t talk again till I got to my camp, well, I lied. Luckily though I’m now a little past the halfway point to my intended destination which is a relief. Speaking of destinations, I didn’t tell you what exactly that is. Turns out way back when before this place become protected land there was a small mining operation running here extracting gold. It didn’t last very long as the big hauls they had in the beginning quickly dried up and caused it to halt operations not even two years after it began.”\n\n*Jeremy pauses for a moment and begins digging through his pack before pulling out a folded piece of paper. He unfolds it and holds it up to the camera. We assume it is the map he and his friends created, he is pointing at one trail in particular named Raven Roost Trail.*\n\n“I think this will give you a better understanding. So right now I am about here on Raven Roost Trail. This trail happens to be the fastest way to get to the mine. Coincidentally it’s also the trail where most of the people have disappeared. Ten in total actually. The last one was three years ago, a man named Jacob Ramirez. He and his wife came out here to reconnect with mother nature I guess. Unfortunately on their first night, something happened to Mr. Ramirez. Ms. Ramirez however was found sometime the next morning by park rangers babbling incoherently to herself. She’s now in an institution a couple hours north of here. Jacob Ramirez was never found, well except for one of his shoes. They were still a good ways off from the mine. I’m actually only a few miles off from where it happened now. I should be camping pretty close to the location tonight which falls right at the edge of the perimeter of disappearances outlined on the map. Spooky right? In truth, I’m getting a little nervous about this now that I think about it, but I didn’t make the drive out here for nothing. I’m gonna rest here for a few more minutes then start back walking.”\n\n*When the camera turns on again the sun has nearly set. Jeremy places the camera on either a stump or rock and begins setting up his camp.*\n\n“I sure hope I can get this put together fast. My pace was slower than I anticipated so I’m a little behind schedule. Really don’t feel like setting all this up in the dark.”\n\n*Jeremy stops talking for a minute while setting up his tent. While this could be the camera malfunctioning we feel it should be included. Multiple times during this silence the camera quality drops drastically followed by a high pitch whine before resetting. Jeremy however doesn’t notice.*\n\n“Here we are! Home sweet home. I don’t know about you guys but I’m starving. I think it’s about high time for some grub.”\n\n*The camera cuts for a few minutes before returning inside the tent with Jeremy holding some sort of ready-to-eat meal.*\n\n“Much better. I’ll get some food in my belly and get a good night's rest and be right as rain by the morning. This food takes a hot minute to cool. Pun intended. So, before I settle in tonight I want to talk a little more on what The Hollow is exactly. Well, at least what I’ve heard it’s supposed to be. So you know how I said the park officially opened in the 1950s, 1952 to be –.”\n\n*Once again another fault occurs with the recording. The imaging cuts to black and the audio has been replaced by a low metallic whir. This continues for a few moments before a grainy image of Jeremy returns with his voice coming out garbled from the audio. The quality returns to normal after a moment.*\n\n“--1906 a few people were on an expedition hunting for resources when they came across what they hoped was a large gold deposit. After spreading the word about their findings they eventually managed to set up a crude mining operation. The money was good at first but as I said earlier began to dwindle after the first few months. Soon, they weren’t even making enough to pay their workers. Then came the accident which caused the place to close for good.” \n\n“The crew on site that day were using dynamite to blast a new tunnel in hopes of finding new deposits. The blasting went smoothly, but according to an article I managed to find on it, a few minutes after the blast some of the mining crew recorded feeling a breeze that pulled inward deeper into the mines. This is around this time that they sent a group of five in to check out their new passage. The crew watched as their lanterns disappeared into the darkness. Thirty minutes passed, then an hour with no signs of the crew. Another smaller group was eventually assembled to go check and see if the mine had collapsed or if there was some other reason they hadn’t returned. They also walked until their lanterns were swallowed up, but this time, they heard something back. Screams began permeating from deep within the tunnels, barely audible, but there nonetheless.”\n\n“The rest of the crew still outside the mine were too frightened to go back in so they left to tell authorities in the nearby town. An attempt was made to rescue any survivors by the local sheriff's office who also recruited a few people from the nearby town to assist in their efforts. Unfortunately, after a deputy and two others who were sent in to locate survivors never returned the search was called off due to it being too dangerous. The mine wasn’t mentioned again until some local kids wandered in a few years later and only one came out. The one who returned however was telling people he met someone in the mine. Someone who promised him whatever he wanted if only he brought him a gift. The kid never elaborated on what said gift was. That night however the kid along with his parents disappeared and according to the article, the parent’s room was covered in more blood than they thought was possible. After this, the town ordered that the mine’s entrance be sealed off. So, that brings me to tonight's big question. Do you think the boy was telling the truth? Was something uncovered in the mine that wasn’t meant to be found? Interesting right? Well, I’ll let you brew on that for a minute. I think my food’s cool enough now, I’ll check back in with you all in the morning.”\n\n*Jeremy turns the camera off to eat and get some sleep. When the camera cuts back on again the camera’s timestamp reads 3:15 am. Jeremy is clearly in a panic, the camera is shaking in his grip. The sounds of people screaming can be heard in the distance which is barely perceptible from the camera’s microphone. It sounds like it is coming from all directions. The tent is pitch black save for the small light being emitted by the camera’s screen which is barely illuminating Jeremy’s face. He begins speaking in a light whisper.*\n\n“I-I don’t know what’s happening. Umm so a few minutes ago woke up to the sound of someone screaming. It was coming from up ahead of me. I know I didn’t see any footprints when I set up camp, but–now, oh god, it’s coming from everywhere. I’m beginning to question if I’m going to make it out o–.”\n\n*Jeremy drops the camera to the floor. The screaming outside which was hardly received by the camera starts to grow in volume.* \n\n“Ohh god, oh god, it’s, they’re coming towards me now. W-what do I do? Somebody help me. I don’t wanna die. I can’t die out here please! Get away from me!\n\n*The screams grew to a volume that was so loud it was distorted, then all at once after hitting that ear-shattering crescendo silenced. From the faint view from the camera on the ground Jeremy is sitting with his knees tucked to his chest, palms pressed over his ears. He slowly lowers them once the screams stop. It appears blood is leaking out of his ears. The expression captured on his face was one of absolute terror. The woods stay silent for about half a minute. The world outside Jeremy’s tent is mute. There is no sound except Jeremy’s erratic breathing and the slight crackle of the microphone. Then, voices fill the air in all directions in unison, all saying the same thing.*\n\n\"Veneror te, deus tenebrarum, accipe hoc sacrificium. Sanguinem hunc effundo in honorem tuum. Tibi offertur anima huius hostiae, ut possis advenire et potestatem tuam ostendere.\"\n\n*The chanting begins to repeat. Jeremy is sobbing now, his cries are being drowned out by the voices outside. Then a faint crimson glow begins to form outside the tent. Its light intensifies by the second. Before long everything inside the tent is lit up, painted crimson. Jeremy moves towards the entrance of the tent and grabs the zipper.  It seems he must be about to try and make a break through the woods, or maybe try and speak with the people outside. The red glow has lit up the entire surrounding forest painting everything red, even the night sky is tinged by it. The tent begins to unzip and get’s halfway before Jeremy freezes. From the footage, there appears to be what looks to be someone who has their arms outstretched toward the tent. The red glow appears to be avoiding them. Said person looks to be almost pitch black despite the intense luminosity in their immediate surroundings. The chant finishes and starts over once again before Jeremy speaks.*\n\n“Veneror te, deus tenebrarum, accipe hoc sacrificium.”\n\n“Please stop, I swear I’ll leave and you’ll never see me again.”\n\n“Sanguinem hunc effundo in honorem tuum.”\n\n*Jeremy breaks down again sobbing, trying desperately to plead for his life. The final line of the chant begins.*\n\n“Stop! Please don’t! Let me go! Ahhh!”\n\n*Jeremy lets out a pained wail as he falls backward. Now, along with his ears, blood is draining out of his eyes and mouth. Jeremy is clawing his eyes with his fingers. Then as the final word is spoken the glow gets so intense it’s the only thing being registered by the camera. All audio cuts out while the only thing being displayed on the screen is an intense red. This lasts for about ten seconds before the frame goes into a fit of static as the audio crackles and then, back to normal. Like nothing even happened. The sounds of the woods return and all we can make out is the grey bottom of Jeremy’s tent that’s lit up from the faint glow of the camera. The camera sits idly as the sun slowly rises. Jeremy is nowhere to be seen along with whoever else was there last night. The camera continues running till almost lunch before the battery gives out.*\n\nOne last thing we have put together from the footage is what the people chanting were saying. We had to send it off to a linguist we are in contact with and this is what they sent us back. Whether it’s correct or not I couldn’t tell you, though hopefully, it’s the latter.\n\n“I worship you, god of darkness, receive this sacrifice. I pour out this blood in your honor. The soul of this offering is offered to you, so that you may come and show your power.”\n\nThis was the story of Jeremy Murphy. The man who wanted to solve the mystery of The Emerald Forest. Instead, he became its 33rd victim. We hope everyone enjoyed our first story. We’ll be back sooner than you think with more bone-chilling tales. \n\nWe hope you will all join us again as we continue to explore the mysteries of the unknown and listen to the voices that speak to us from [beyond](https://www.reddit.com/r/SoullessHQ/)!",

        "text": "[I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11k3gtg/my_cat_flew_with_morana_air_she_came_back/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nI really, really, really want to put this all behind me. I just want to wake up tomorrow morning and pretend that Lola died at a vet’s office in Islamabad and move on with my life. The past 48 hours have been absolute hell and, again, I want to move on — but I feel like I owe you guys an update.\n\nFor those of you who are not familiar, or forgot, I posted on here last night about Lola (my cat). I was moving from Islamabad to Prague for a teaching job and, shortly before my flight, Lola died. My airline wouldn’t take her body so I booked her a flight through Morana Air. When she arrived, she wasn’t dead anymore.\n\nWell, it’s not really Lola. The body that the creature inhabits used to belong to my dear Lola, of that I’m sure, but whatever came out of that animal carrier is not my cat. It howls in this horrid dark way and it smells like rotting meat. My Lola died and I was still growing to accept that and suddenly this horrible creature got thrust into my life.\n\nThere were a couple nice comments when I originally told you my story, and I guess it’s because of them that I’m back — but goddamn it, there were so many of you telling me to just keep the cat. More proof the internet is filled with crazy people.\n\nThis thing stank to high heaven and was not meant to be alive. I knew I had to get rid of it. I tried calling some adoption places last night, but none of them spoke English. There was a new faculty city tour coming up in the morning, so I figured I would ask someone there. I thought that one night with the weird howling creature would be manageable.\n\nIt was utter torture.\n\nBack at the start of my career I was working in Estonia and I supervised a history class trip to Berlin. During our second night at the hotel, one of the kids tried climbing over the balconies to reach his classmate’s window and fell. He just broke his leg, but it was a pretty long drop. The amount of worry and dread I went to sleep with that night in Berlin is just about only thing comparable to last night.\n\nThe inescapable stench, the terrible noises, the stare — I spent the whole night in utter dread. The creature spent the whole night shifting its gaze between me and the pigeons gathered on the other side of the courtyard.\n\nAround four or five I lost my nerve and tried pushing the cat out onto the roof. I figured if it was so interested in the pigeons, it could go investigate them on its own. The undead cat did not like that. The moment I touched it the creature hissed and scratched and revealed teeth completely unlike those that Lola had.\n\nI had to do the three-hour city tour in the morning on no sleep whatsoever. What was considerably worse was that the smell of death had fused into my clothes and people noticed. Prague is a fascinating city but hearing about its history while sleep deprived and smelling like an overfilled trashcan is far from pleasant.\n\nNo one from the school staff had any idea about pet adoption centers but one of the folks who helped organize the tour told me she would send me some info on Monday when the school year started. I wasn’t about to start talking to a new colleague about undead cats. I made it sound like I was planning on adopting myself. Staying with the cat until Monday though was out of the question.\n\nI was going to go scour the expat friendly section of the internet for a place to drop off the cat, but throughout the tour the guide seemed to constantly find reasons to talk about how Prague is the most haunted city in Europe. When he took us for a beer after the tour, as a joke, I asked if he knew of any paranormal experts to consult with in Prague. Without missing a beat, the guide provided a business card of a woman who dealt with the occult and spoke English. She had an office at I.P. Pavlova and could help with whatever strange problems one might encounter around Prague.\n\nBeing out in the fresh air helped me forget the horrid smell of the undead cat. Returning back to my apartment provided a terrible reminder. The sounds it made, the terrible way it stared at me — I knew that what was in the room with me was not my Lola, but the resemblance hurt. For a while I did my best to ignore the strange cat and just search for adoption places, yet when my search didn’t provide any results, I picked up my phone and called the number off the business card.\n\nThe voice on the other side of the line was cold and slow. She said she didn’t want to know what my problem was. That is what the consolation was for. All the woman wanted to know was my name and when I would arrive. Once she got that information out of me, she told me she looks forward to our meeting and hung up.\n\nI didn’t know whether to take the cat with me. Picking it up made me dry heave and, even if I could handle prolonged exposure to the horrible stench, the cat was not interested in being carried. As the clock counted down to my meeting with the presumed paranormal expert, however, I realized that going without the cat would make it considerably more difficult to explain my predicament. It hurt to push what used to be my Lola into the animal container, but I did my best to remind myself that the smelly howling thing wasn’t actually my cat.\n\nThe paranormal expert’s office was directly above a busy intersection. All the way up the stairs I could hear the screeching of trams and constant hum of traffic, yet past the threshold of the office all trace of the outside world disappeared. The windows were covered and the lights were off, only a singular candle sitting on a table provided vision. The world outside had gone quiet, but the room was not completely silent. \n\nThe howling from inside of the animal container refused to relent.\n\nShe did not introduce herself, but she addressed me by name. She was in her thirties, maybe. That’s all that I could figure out past the bizarre costume she wore. Her skin was colored a pale blue and a mess of eyeballs was drawn on her forehead. The smell and meowing of the creature in my animal carrier was unavoidable but she didn’t mention it. She simply twitched her nose and asked me whether I was there for a tarot card session or a crystal ball reading.\n\nI told her I was there for neither. Holding back tears and battling constant interruptions from the animal container, I told her the whole story. I told her everything, from the little kitten that followed my trail of kebab meat back in university to how that little kitten grew to become an old globe-trotting cat to how that old cat died. Then I pointed at the animal container and told her that that’s why I’m here. I told her I came to her because my cat had risen from the dead.\n\nWith a nod that I could not decipher, the strange woman slunk back into the darkness of her office. She emerged with a glass sphere that looked like it belonged to the IKEA catalog. I tried to tell the woman that I wasn’t looking for her to read my future, that I just wanted to figure out why my dead cat was still alive. She ignored me. She ignored me and started to rub the ball and dramatically chant in a language I couldn’t understand.\n\nThe louder the woman got, the more agitated the cat in the animal container got. It started to claw at the door and throw its body from side to side. The blue painted woman didn’t spare as much as a look for the howling animal. She just ran her palms across the crystal ball and chanted and did a terrible pantomime of communing with the spirits or something among those lines. The glass sphere beneath her fingers was turning a sickly hue of green but by then I had decided that I was in the office of a fraud.\n\nThe paranormal expert had zero interest in my problem and was just trying to squeeze money out of me. I had seen countless videos about the scams inside of Prague’s tourist trade and I had been dumb enough to take my tour guide at face value. I was beyond ready to leave and just consider my payment to the blue fortuneteller an idiot tax.\n\nThat’s when the undead cat burst out of its container.\n\nSomehow, I don’t know how, the cat managed to get the metal door of the box open. Immediately, it jumped onto the table and pressed both of its mangy paws against the crystal ball. Something popped inside of the glass sphere and the greenish light went dark. For a second, in the light of the candle, I could see the fortuneteller’s face twist from religious zeal to confusion but then the room was plunged into total darkness.\n\n*MNEEEEoooOOOooOOw!*\n\nA blood red glow stemming from the crystal ball ate away at the darkness of the room. The cat, the corpse of my Lola — it was standing with its front paws pressed against the glass. Her familiar milky eyes were gone. Shining orbs of red had replaced them.\n\n“*No, no, no! This is not the vessel I was promised!*”\n\nThe words seemed to be coming from some deep region of my skull, but on the crystal ball I could see a set of lips moving. They were bruised and chewed and wet with blood.\n\n*“No, no, no!* *This is not the vessel I paid for!”*\n\nWhatever calm and cool demeanor that the mystic had disappeared the moment the candle went out. She was staring at me with her mouth wide open. The eyes that weren’t drawn on were filled with terror.\n\n*“The covenant has not been fulfilled to my expectations. No, I demand reparations!”* the bloody lips screamed as the crystal ball grew brighter and brighter. “*A circle of salt, an unborn thing. Yes, that will free me of these shackles. A circle of salt, an unborn thing. I will avenge this swindle. A circle of salt an unborn —”*\n\nThe crystal ball shattered in a flash of light. For a moment, as the room fell back into complete blackness, I could see the cat’s eyes glow red in the dark like two fading embers. When even those went out, for a breath or two, the room plunged back into utter silence.\n\nI asked the fortune teller what to do.\n\nThe blue lady shoved me out of the room. All trace of the mystic in her had disappeared. She was scared. She was scared and she wanted both me and the cat out of her office. She didn’t even ask for money. She just shoved outside of her door and closed it and locked it and refused any other form of communication.\n\nI was left alone with the corpse of my cat. Even before it had used a crystal ball to speak at me with bloody lips I wanted to get rid of the thing. Whatever demoniac stunt I had just witnessed pushed me over the edge.\n\nI walked out of the building, crossed the intersection and then went to the nearby KFC. A flock of pigeons was pecking away at discarded chips outside. I thought that was a good enough spot to leave the cat as any. She seemed interested in the pigeons in my courtyard so I figured KFC pigeons would be just as interesting.\n\nThey weren’t.\n\nWhen I put down the animal container and opened the door the cat had no interest in the pigeons. It simply sat there, howling and smelling like an aged corpse. It wasn’t until I caught a tram that she crawled out of the box. For a second, for a mere second, I could see Lola’s eyes looking back at me. Then the doors closed and the tram screeched off.\n\nI’m not one for crying on public transport, but I did. I cried to a point where three separate people came to talk to me. Two of them came to check that I was okay. One of them came to tell me to keep it down. The good old charms of city life.\n\nI’ve cried on the tram ride back home, but I’ve got no more tears to give.\n\nI’m done now.\n\nI’m done with this whole insane situation and I’m going to move on with my life and pretend as if nothing happened. I owed you guys an update, and now you have it. I’m never coming back to this weird corner of the internet. I’m never going to think about what happened to my poor Lola again.\n\nShe died in a vets office a thousand miles away and that’s it. She died and she got buried and I’ve never heard of the name Morana [Air](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/11k3ds4/morana_air/).",

        "text": " I have been single for the past 12 years. I don’t know if I will ever find love again, and I sure as hell hope it doesn’t find me. My therapist recommended I give writing a try, something about closure. I was married once and I am still trying to recover from what happened. So here goes nothing, this is my attempt at journaling what happened.\n\nAnnie was the love of my life. I worshipped the ground she walked on. We had been married two years at that time, and they’d been the fastest two years of my life. I would say we had a really good thing going. Or at least we did before I found out about Mark. \n\nMark was just a coworker, according to Annie. Maybe he erred on the side of “a bit too friendly” or “lacking boundaries,” but those were her words. To me he was a fucking weirdo who clearly wanted to put a baby in my wife. I thought it was all one sided, until one afternoon when I stumbled upon a video on my wife’s phone of Mark taking Annie from behind.\n\nIt was an unsuspecting Tuesday in June. The summer evening air flowed in through the open windows of the kitchen, carrying with it the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers and freshly cut grass. The sun had just set, casting a warm orange glow across the sky. The sound of crickets and cicadas could be heard in the distance, providing a soothing background noise. As I stood by the sink, I watched as the last bit of light faded away, leaving behind a serene darkness. My neighbor Terry was locking away his mower for the night, as he waved at me from his yard. I truly believe this to be the last happy moment I would experience in my life.\n\nAnnie was in the shower when I saw it. I needed to go onto her Google calendar and add an appointment, or grab a mutual friends number from her contacts, I don’t even remember anymore. All I remember is the message that conveniently popped up as I unlocked her phone.\n\nMark*: Is Jack still leaving next weekend for his business trip?*\n\nCuriously, I tapped the notification and quickly skimmed their message thread together. It looked like it was all innocent enough, until I got to the video. The video showed a side profile of what was going on, as if it was propped up on a night stand. I could tell it was filmed in a shitty hotel. The kind you only stay at when you’re either hiding, or shooting dope. In the frame, I could see that Mark had his hands firmly planted on Annie’s hips and lower back. I’ll leave the rest to your imagination.\n\nI never thought it would happen to me. My wife, my rock, my everything. My Annie. But when I found the video, I couldn't deny it any longer. My stomach churned as I imagined her in the arms of another man, moaning his name into his ear. My mind spun with thoughts of revenge, of screaming and yelling and breaking things. But deep down, all I felt was a hollow emptiness. How could she do this to me? Was I not enough? I wasn’t sure how to react, so I didn’t.\n\nOnce Annie was out of the shower and dried off, she came and found me in the living room to let me know she wanted to go to bed. I told her that I would be there shortly and to not wait up as I wanted to catch up on my show, avoiding eye contact and feigning indifference. The burning I felt in my face was akin to the surface of the sun as she softly spoke. Eventually, she left me to my own devices. As the minutes went by, the clock hit midnight and I could no longer stagnate on the couch. I decided a night walk around my neighborhood was what I needed to come up with my next move.\n\nI stepped out into the warm summer night, feeling the familiar crunch of gravel beneath my sneakers. The air was thick with humidity, and the scent of freshly cut grass mingled with the sharp tang of gasoline from passing cars. The sky was a deep shade of blue, with stars twinkling like diamonds scattered across a black velvet canvas. As I walked, I felt a sense of peace settle over me, the kind that only comes with the stillness of a summer evening. I passed by houses with windows aglow in soft yellow light, the distant sound of laughter and music drifting through the air. It was a moment of tranquility in an otherwise hectic world, and I savored every step I took, knowing that when I went back home my entire life was going to be different.\n\nAs I rounded the corner onto the street I lived on, I noticed something odd. Terry, my neighbor, had left his garage door wide open. As I approached, I saw that it was empty, alit with only a warm incandescent light bulb hanging from the ceiling. That was certainly unusual for Terry, as he was a very fastidious neighbor and made sure his doors were always locked and his property was all buttoned up. A real square.\n\nI walked around the side of the garage and climbed the three steps to his front door, and as I raised my hand to knock the door fell slightly open. Terry peeked around through the small crack, and looked puzzled, as if I had walked in on a private matter.\n\n*“Hey uh- Terry, it looks like your garage door is wide open man, just a heads up.”* I uttered meekly.\n\n*“Oh! Thanks Jack. I must have left it open when I put my shears away earlier. What are you doing out here so late, by the way?”* Terry replied, almost suspiciously.\n\n*“Had a rough night. I like to walk sometimes to clear my head. Especially if I need to make a big decision, or feel better about something.”* I confided in my neighbor.\n\n*“Do you wanna come in for a drink? I know it’s late but it looks like neither of us are ready for the night to be over.”* Terry asked, almost too excitedly.\n\nI thought about it momentarily, but ultimately decided to take him up on his offer.\n\nAs I entered his home, I took note that the inside of his house was just as clean as the outside. The faint smell of bleach wafting into my nostrils told me that he was sanitary. Clinical, even. I followed him sheepishly into his kitchen where he was already pulling a bottle of what looked to be bourbon out of his cupboard. He poured me a shot, and this is when things get a bit blurry.\n\nWe were pounding down shot after shot, admittedly a little too quickly before I started to notice what was happening to me. My heart was rapidly beating in my chest, while my brain seemed to be moving at a snails pace, and my vision moving even slower. I took a seat at his counter and inhaled a deep breath of the clean, slightly bleach smelling air.\n\n*“So why are you really walking around in the middle of the night, Jack?”* Terry prodded, with his eyes narrowed. He seemed unaffected by the alcohol.\n\n*“I- uh- have a tough decision to make tonight, with the wife ya know?”* I slurred back.\n\nTerry nodded.\n\n*“You finally caught on to her and Mark, huh Jackie boy? Took you long enough. I had them figured out months ago. Did you know that he likes to have your wife in the kitchen too? With the curtains open in the middle of the day. I can see exactly what he likes to do to your wife from my garden shed.”* Terry stated calmly.\n\nMy stomach dropped, my heart skipped a beat, and my brain began to freeze in place. I could no longer think. If I was standing I surely would have stumbled and fell over. It was all too much to take in, especially in my inebriated state of mind. I stared at Terry with tears forming in my eyes, unable to speak.\n\n*“I like you Jack. You’ve always been a good neighbor, and you always keep things to yourself. I think I may have something that’ll make you feel better.”* Terry stood up and beckoned for me to follow.\n\nI felt like I was in a trance and was falling victim to the power of suggestion. I followed him down the steps to his basement. A narrow hallway opened to a room full of large chest freezers. The room easily was 30’x30’ and each wall had its own row of freezers, with the cords plugged in to a slew of longer extension cords. This felt wrong. I knew I should not be down there, and I knew I had to run, but my brain-body connection was nonexistent and I felt like I had no control over my own movements.\n\nWe reached the far back corner of the freezer-room when he approached one of the units in the corner. He pulled the key out of his pocket and unlocked the lid. When he lifted it, I immediately recognized what was inside. There were two bodies, laying in sardine style. On the right hand side I recognized the face of Mark, and it seemed to be permanently frozen into an expression of fear. Primal, unfiltered fear. His throat was cut and all the blood had been cleaned from the wound to leave a small incision that had not been stitched. My head slowly turned to the left-hand side, where I saw my Annie. She was clearly deceased, and her eyelids were surgically removed.\n\nTerry finally spoke. *“I made her watch, Jack. They drank the same thing you did. They followed me down here with no objections, they even climbed in themselves and Annie watched helplessly as I drained Mark of his blood. I did you a favor. All your problems have been solved. I did this for you, Jack.”*\n\nSomething in me woke up. Instinctually, my legs gained sentience and my brain kicked into overdrive. Before I knew what was happening, I was sprinting out of Terry’s front door and was halfway down the block. I reached the end of the street and charged into the local 24/7 corner store where a terrified middle-aged cashier helped me dial the police.\n\nThe rest of the night was a blur. I was hauled into the police station for questioning, and Terry was arrested on suspicion of over a dozen counts of murder. By the end of that week, it sounded like the prosecutor had planned on letting him ride the lightning in the electric La-Z-Boy, but I knew that could sometimes take a decade or more. He is probably still awaiting his execution.\n\nWhenever I am cleaning my house with bleach, I think about Terry. Whenever I go down to the basement of my new house, I think about how annoying it was moving all those old freezers out of there, and how expensive it was upgrading to newer models.",

        "text": "I'm not sure if I'm asking for help or if I just need someone to hear my story (maybe someone can relate), but I haven't had the best relationship with sleep since I can remember and while it's gotten better as I'm an adult, I still get randomly affected by whatever paranoia or paranormal thing plauges me. \n\nIt's starts as a child between the ages of 5 and 10, I use to sleep walk and talk. It got so bad that my mom had to lock doors and baracade the stairs because she was afraid I'd hurt myself. I lived on the second floor and it was a common occurrence for me to walk down stairs anxiety ridden by something but my mom couldn't always understand by what. For example, once it was because I forgot to finish my homework. At first my mom thought I was awake during these occurrences, but I guess she realized that I never made any sense, I barely reacted to anything my mom did and I was very zombie like with glazed eyes. My sister who slept in the same room as I was always freaked out when I shot up in bed and just started rambling. She said sometimes she could actaully have conversations with me even though it was all nonsense. While scary to my family sometimes, when they shared their stories with me I never thought much of it. Also I should note, while possibly connected in a trauma way or legitimately paranormal way, my mom and sister always had stories about the house we lived in, our family history, and experiences we've witnessed together. I say witnessed together, but I have barely any memory of my childhood. I have strange bits and peices that can be very specific, but sometimes when I hear stories it surprises me that I didn't remember it. Despite all these stories being a bit creepy for a child to take in, I literally was never scared as a child before I turned 10. I mean NEVER scared. I was a very worry free and brave child who loved the dark, storms, and Horror movies. Yes, I would sneak up to watch IT or Chucky in the middle of the night when my sister was out with her friends. Nothing bothered me personally until my mom got a new boyfriend and we moved states.\n\nI moved to GA when I was about 9 or 10 and I moved around a lot. The spooky stuff (that I can remember) and the anxiety began immediately. I suffered from horrible sleep paralysis and I began to have have major anxiety of something being in the room with me at night. I don't know what triggered these paranoid filled nights, but even to this day I still suffer from them and I don't know why despite being nowhere near as scared as I was from ages 10-17. The sleep paralysis can be anything from hearing/seeing someone in the corner of the room, my mom taking to me in a very upsetting way, or......alien abduction. I know...wow. The alien abduction scenes have happened twice that I can remember, but each time there were bright pulsating  lights coming from outside my window, a discomforting body feeling of vibrations and numbness, and I couldn't see anything in the room but I definitely felt something there. The last time this happened was when I was about 15, but I still get sleep paralysis to this day...just far and few between. It actually just happened to me last night, but nothing notable happened. I just panicked, calmed down, and then tried multiple times to jolt myself awake. I know this happened because I was extremely sleep deprived...from anxiety that started the night before.\n\nOther than sleep paralysis, which doesn't always have to happen when am having bad nights, I have extremely anxiety ridden nights where I refuse to fall asleep no matter how painful it can be come sunrise and I usually ended up sitting on my bed crying with the lights on for hours. Last night I wasn't as panicked as I would've been when I was younger, but it was unsettling and I tried to rationalized my fears, but I just could not let my self close my eyes for too long and if I did fall asleep for maybe 30 minutes or an hour I woke up in a jolt or...like last night in paralysis. My fears are usually someone watching me. As a teen I think I remember it feeling fairly sinister which is why I cried and had panic attacks...but like last night and being more familiar with my anxiety..it didn't feel sinister or dark. Despite that making me feel a little better, I was still terrified of falling asleep. Things I have noted are, one.. these bad nights are very common in the place they happen after they happen for the first time (when I went back within last year to visit my parents...the room I slept in where this happened to me when I was younger...happened to me again....so I told my mom I didn't want to sleep nor be near that room so she put me in the guest room and I had no problems...mostly...but atleast I let myself get some sleep.), two I hear things moving or being tapped, and three it's a very common occurrence to happen when I'm near my family....especially my mom, but It never happens in places I think could actually be haunted, like my partner's moms house which is VERY old or my own bedroom in the various apartment and houses I lived on my own. \n\nI do have a strong attraction towards the occult, witchcraft, and anything dark...but I truly don't believe that I'm simply just afraid of a \"ghost\" that isn't there. I rarely, if ever, get scared in my own bed and I go ghost hunting to actaully haunted places and I'm a fairly calm and curious person that doesn't freak out like some of the people I go with. Actaully...I don't entirely believe in the paranormal, but only because I'm a very see it to believe it person. I want to believe and I have had some weird interactions in the past year that make me question a lot...but I typically debunk a lot of evidence. Last thing I want to throw out there because it is very unique and probably contributes to me not remembering many memories is that I have aphantasia. Meaning I don't have an \"imagination\" or \"minds eye\" so if I did ever see an apparition or something in front of me....it would be very hard to explain away because I don't think I can hallucinate anything visual. I'd love to know if you have any thoughts, unfortunaly this is all very surace level details...I could write a novel on everything I've been through and how unexplainable its been. Thank you for reading.",

        "text": "I guess I can just start when I first noticed the hair. It was morning about a month ago, maybe a little less. I had the dream again, the one I have most nights. In the dream, I’m swinging in the park where we had our sort of first date, and Holly is swinging next to me. I’m the age I am now, but she’s the age she was then, well, not the age she was during the first date, but the age she was when she left, twenty-seven. \n\nShe looks beautiful in the dream, just like she did in life. She’s wearing a little flowy dress that doesn’t quite come down to her knees, the blue one with pink and white roses on it. When she swings forward the dress runs up her tanned thighs, and dream me looks every time. She’s barefoot, and she’s laughing, at least at first, like I just said something really funny, but the dream always starts there, with her laughing, and then the laughter stops and her smile fades and we both stop swinging and just sit there, kind of swaying back and forth a little bit. She digs her toes into the sand and waits for me to speak first.\n\n“I miss you,” I say ever night almost, in the dream. She smiled at me, a sad smile, the only kind of smile I got at the end.\n\n“I miss you too,” she says. I wonder if this is what she would really say if she was still here, but the dream Holly says it and I savor the words off of her lips like someone savors good scotch. \n\n“I don’t know why you did what you did,” I say and she shrugs her shoulders. She looks down at her buried toes, her shoulder-length blonde hair falling to obscure her face. I lean toward her and tuck her hair behind her ear so I can see her. I open my mouth to speak in the dream but she turns on me.\n\n“Can’t we just sit here and enjoy one another? Do we have to talk about it? I did it, okay? I did it and maybe I regret it if I can. I don’t know, this isn’t really me, this is the me that lives inside your head.”\nThose words crush me, and that’s usually when I wake up, drenched in a cold sweat. Some dreams vanish when you wake, in bits and pieces, chugging like milk from an overturned jug. But this dream never does, it didn’t the first time I had it, and it doesn’t now. \n\nI lay in bed, feeling my heart race, and I relive the dream in my head. \n\nThat’s what I did that morning, the morning I found my heart string. Eventually, I got up and went to the bathroom, giving up on more sleep. I stopped at the sink and looked into the mirror and that’s when I saw it: a great oily black hair jutting from my chest, thick and curled. I looked down, putting my chin to my chest as I touched the hair.\n\nIt seemed to thrum almost, not with energy, but bumping to the beat of my heart. It was as if I could check my pulse by setting the pad of my forefinger on that hair. It was long, maybe half an inch. I could curl it once around my finger. I did so and pulled quickly trying to pluck it, but it I couldn’t get a good grip on it.\n\nI tried to pluck it for a few minutes and then gave up. Instead, I opened my medicine cabinet, pulled out my razor, and ran it dry right across the hair.\n\nI winced in pain as it was sliced away from my body. It must have been ingrown, that’s what I thought at the time. I know better now. The hair fell into my sink and I picked it up and held it before my eyes. The end was red, a tiny drop of blood. Very ingrown, apparently. \n\nI showered and dressed and went to work early, pulling into the parking lot just as the Sun rose in the sky, turning it the brilliant orange of dawn. I sat in my car and waited an hour for my boss to show up and followed him in since he had the keys. I worked at a small trucking company, handling payroll. I had always been good at math, something Holly hated about me because she was so shit at it. I mean like, she would freeze up if you asked her a simple multiplication problem, so sure she would get it wrong. So she clammed up to keep herself from any sense of embarrassment. She had always struggled with that, being embarrassed. If she said something wrong or did something wrong, she felt like it was the end of the world. Her eyes would well with tears and she’d excuse herself from whatever the situation was and she would go and stew for the rest of the night. \n\nMy work is nothing special, easy for me, but not fulfilling like it once was. I hardly spoke to anyone that day, like I usually do. They know I was married, and they know I’m not now, but they don’t know that Holly hung herself. \n\nThat was almost ten years ago when she left. She went to work like any other morning, but she must have just gone around the corner and waited for me to leave. because she went back to our home, and I can picture so clearly, what she must have done, just from how she left things. I can see her in her skirt and blouse, I can see her stepping in through the front door and kicking her heels off. One stood upright and one was on its side. \n\nShe went into the kitchen and got a glass of water, drinking half of it, leaving a little smudge of lipstick on the rim, and setting it next to the sink. Then she went to the basement door, pulling off her thigh-high stockings as she did so. Those were for me, I’m crazy about legs, and lose it for thigh-high stockings. The ones she wore the day she hung herself were nude, with frilly elastic tops. \n\nAs she moved down the stairs she undressed completely, her skirt, blouse, and panties discarded on the wooden steps. In the basement, she took an extension cord from a hook on the wall, threw it over a metal bar that ran along the ceiling, and looped the end into a noose. Up onto an ottoman that went with a chair we no longer had, and bye bye Holly. \n\nOn the way home from work I thought about stopping at Champ’s, the local bar, to see Leah, a cute twenty-something whom I’ve gotten to know pretty well. There’s chemistry there, and I think she would accept if I asked her out, but I’m just not sure I’m ready. I mean, it’s only been ten years, right?\n\nI just came home that day, the day I found the heart string, that day almost a month ago. I sat on the couch and absently scratched at my chest through my shirt. It was itchy there, right where the long hair had been. I slid my hand in through the neck of my shirt and my fingers touched a long, oily, almost stiff hair that thrummed along with the beat of my heart.\n\nI pulled my hand out and stood, taking my shirt off as I went to the bathroom. Looking in the mirror, I saw that the hair had grown back, just as long as it had been. I couldn’t believe it. I even checked the bathroom garbage and there was the first hair, right on top. \nI took my razor and shaved it off again, wincing in pain as I did so. I kept checking for the rest of the evening, but the hair didn't grow back. That night I slept better. I didn’t dream of Holly, I dreamt of Leah. Sexy little Leah, in bed with me. It was a good dream, I guess.\nWhen I woke my hand went to my chest.\n\nThere was the hair. \n\nAnd that’s how the month has gone. I shave it or clip it off with scissors, and it’s back before you know it. Each time I get rid of it, it hurts, and it bleeds, just a little. I don’t know what to do. I saw once on the internet a hair that had sort of gone back into the skin and grew that way, spiraling around itself under the skin, longer and longer, and then poking back out. Maybe that’s what’s happened here. I think tonight when I get home from work I’m going to try to pull the hair out. Maybe I can get it all, instead of just clipping a bit of it. There’s clearly more in there. I think I might stop by Champ’s and ask Leah out too. What's the harm? \n\nI guess I can come back and let you all know what happens, one way or the other. I’ll have this damned hair out of me at least, and maybe I’ll need advice on just what the hell I’m going to wear on a date. Do I sign off or anything? Like with my name? That seems like it could be right. \n\nOkay, back with more later. Wish me luck. \n\nKevin.",

        "text": "Right off, we're not here to discuss my job. Not today, anyways. For obvious reasons, I can't go into much depth on it. I suppose I'll just give information as it becomes relevant, this is already going to get me into trouble with my superiors. Still, I feel that I can't sit on this much longer and we aren't strangers to letting people outside the organisation in on some choice details. I'd prefer to tell you this way instead of you figuring it out when one of our ops goes wrong. Because it's starting to get to that point.\n\nSuffice it to say, we're not your CIA or MI6 brand of intelligence. We're more an international initiative without loyalty to any single nation or group, rather working to identify and eliminate threats to humanity as a whole. Human threats and, as I became increasingly aware, threats of... other natures. If the execution of our duty makes us skip over some red tape, so be it. Let's call us the Office (haha, Steve Carrel, parkour!, get it out of your systems and be glad I'm not using MIB for the placeholder.)\n\nJust to get a few more thing about of the way - these stories span a long period. I, much like anyone else, started as a grunt. Through the years, I've risen up the ranks, been given access to more information.  Currently I lead a small team, let's call them Alpha Squad, and we're specialised in deploying for long periods of time without any support from or contact with command, though we're called upon for many things from quick strikes to long-term intel ops.\n\nYou can call me M.\n\nI can cover how I got into this field at another time if you like. For now, I'll start with a single story.\n\nBack when I finished my induction training, I was attached to a very average squad - we weren't agents or anything. Other people did the spy stuff, we were the ones they called in if they expected things to go south and needed some guns on hand. My first deployment, we were called in to help raid a small base as the endpoint of an investigation that had been ongoing for a long time before I'd ever even heard of the Office. My squad was inserted some distance from the base, planning to approach on foot from the south while other teams closed in from other directions. Our squad in particular had to walk through a heavily wooded area to get to our position for the raid.\n\nSo. 5am, dead of winter, we're trudging through this ocean of dead trees. Everywhere I look, all I see is pale bark and jagged, bare branches, looming out of the fog. God, the fog. It was heavy enough that we were walking closer together than standard spread so that we didn't accidentally lose sight of each other. I was drawing up on the far right, so on one side I could see my squad mate, picking through the detritus of dead leaves and twigs, steps muffled. I could make him and the next guy over out fairly clearly, we were all wearing basic gear - black clothes and plate carriers, helmets that covered our entire heads, assigned gun and sidearm, both silenced, and anything else our specific role required carried in our packs - standard fare, none of the fancy stuff for us grunts. On the other side... nothing. Just the occasional silhouette of one of those trees, stretching up, lost in the fog. As we walked, we did radio checks every few minutes. The squad lead would send a burst of static over comms and we'd respond in kind, the most basic of check-in systems but at least it was silent and reliable. We were keeping our Friend-or-Foe (FoF) tags off for now so that we weren't transmitting unnecessary signals. Let me tell you, I was pretty nervous. I thought all of that would have been drilled out of me during training, but hey. It was my first actual op and I didn't want to mess up. I was lost in these thoughts when it struck me - there hadn't been a check-in in a while. I look to my left.\n\nNothing.\n\nShit.\n\nI remember thinking how much shit my squad would give me for getting lost while walking in a straight line when I sent two bursts of static over comms, basically just sending \"?\". I wait for a moment. No response. I repeat the signal. Nothing again. At this point, I decide to to risk speaking over comms because every second I didn't know exactly where my squad was, the longer it would take me to link up with them. \"Guys, I've lost visual contact with you, could someone light up an FoF?\" I ask.\n\nSilence.\n\nI don't know how I rationalised it to myself back then but I think I had convinced myself that the forest and fog were somehow messing with comms even though the systems were rated for... well, anything, especially since there was no way in hell my squad was more than a hundred meters from me. It was just one of those things where I made a couple of stupid, baseless assumptions that made enough sense in the moment that I didn't bother considering them critically. \n\nGrumbling away,I started backtracking, hoping to pick up a trail that I would be able to follow to my team. It wasn't long before I found a path of disturbed undergrowth that had run parallel to mine until it diverged slightly - I couldn't tell which one of us had changed direction. I began following is, jogging to gain ground. Surely my squad would have noticed my absence by now and would have stopped up ahead, waiting for me to report in or catch up. I kept sending bursts of static over the radio, just in case someone picked it up.\n\nIt was then that I saw the trees moving.\n\nI stopped dead, staring. Those silhouettes, the ones lost in the fog, at the edge of visibility. They were shifting with glacial slowness, just... sliding across the ground. I was sure that it must have been the movement of the fog distorting my vision or my imagination or something but... well, I'm sure I don't have to explain why this was a bit bloody unnerving. I take off sprinting, following the trail of flattened leaves and broken twigs. I'm holding my gun so tight that my hands are starting to go numb though I don't know what I hoped to do with it. I just wanted to get back to my squad and back on mission. Those were things I knew, things I could deal with. I can swear that I hear the sounds of pursuit, footsteps just out of sync with mine. Looking back, I don't see anything but the sound is definitely there. I could imagine nothing worse than being lost in the forest, hunted, alone. So I was pretty relieved when I see the back of the person clad in heavy black clothing emerging from the fog in front of me, weapon held loose at their side. \n\n\"Shit, man, sorry. Radio was acting up.\" I say, checking over my shoulder and slowing down as I came up to them. No response. \"Hey.\" I call, raising my voice slightly and I slow down to a walk, catching my breath. I'm up behind the person now and, even as I place a hand on their shoulder, I notice some things. What I had taken to be our bulky combat gear was actually layers upon layers of tattered black robes. That wasn't a black helmet, that was dark, purified skin stretched tight around the person's skull. And what I had taken through the fog to be their gun held casually, hanging down at their side, was actually elongated, spindly, claw-like fingers. \n\nI'm frozen as the being turns but, before I can get a look at its face, it starts screaming. The shrillest, loudest sound I've ever heard. Just pure pain, anguish, anger, ringing through those woods, digging into my skull like someone driving knives into my ears. I fall back to the ground, clutching my head, screaming as well. Through the tears in my eyes, I can see this thing begin walking towards me.\n\nThe trees are closing in. \n\nWait... no...\n\nCreatures like the one looming over me were stalking through the fog. Even as I watch, one of them goes down on all fours, crawling low to the ground as it slowly makes it way towards me, surrounding me, cutting off any hopes of escape. Images begin flashing through my eyes, thoughts and feeling. A white room and fear. A tall man and anger. Bright lights and... pain. So, so much pain.\n\nAnd still, that horrific sound. I clench my eyes closed as it grows even louder.\n\nI don't recall too much. I fumbled with my gun, brought it around to try to fire blindly towards the thing as I pushed myself away, but pain paralyzed me. And then my arms are being pinned down. I struggled but I remember thinking that that was it. That I was dead and that I'd never even know what the hell had even happened, that I would die with nothing but questions. But I suppose God, fate, luck, whatever you want to call it, had another plan for me.\n\n\"... rookie! Watch ... gun! M, calm the ... down!\"\n\nMy ears are ringing but I make out words. I open my eyes and blink away the tears, looking up into the visor of my squad mate, holding me down. He shakes my shoulders. \"What the hell happened?\" the soldier growls. I look around. The rest of the squad surrounds us, guns up. But they aren't forming a defensive circle. They're aiming at me. I turn back to the man over me, the squad leader. \"You... you didn't see that?\" I ask.\n\n\"All I saw, rookie, was you groaning and crawling on the ground and then trying to punch my head off when I tried to get you up.\"\n\nMy mind scrambles. This isn't the ideal time for a breakdown. Was the pressure of the mission too much? No, that couldn't be it. I'd trained so hard. I was conditioned through and through, countless hours running sims and training ops just for me to have a nervous breakdown on the first-\n\nMy eyes fall to my wrist, where my sleeve has rolled up. Where the creature had grabbed my arms to hold me down. Where four long, spindly bruises were forming.\n\nSo it had been real. I'd thought I'd left all that shit behind. I've always seen, experienced... more... than other people. This isn't the time to explain either. I shrugged my sleeve down.\n\n\"Was running to catch up when we separated. Hit my shin against a rock. Hard. I'm green, sir.\"\n\n\"Like hell you are, rook, and you're a shit liar as well. Get your ass back to drop off and call in an evac, [rifleman], go with-\"\n\n\"No!\" I cut him off. I didn't want to be off the mission. I didn't want to leave my squad high and dry like that, or fail in such a spectacular fashion before we'd even reached the base. But, more than anything, I didn't want to go back through the forest.\n\n\"No. Sir. I'm green.\"\n\nHe looked down at me, trying to get a reading on me through my visor. I may be new but we're all trained to the highest standard. We're all competent and know our limits. We've run enough drills together to trust each other without question. I was hoping against hope that that would be enough to convince him.\n\nThe pause stretched on.\n\n\"Then you're green, rook. Get yourself sorted and get back in line. Center this time, M.\" \n\nI nod.\n\n\nI'm not sure I can tell you much about the raid itself, not before I get all of this cleared with the spooks up top. Suffice it to say, whatever was going on in those labs was a horror story in and of itself. If I'd told anyone in my squad that the surrounding woods were haunted after what we saw in there... well, they'd have probably told me \"no shit\". Again, story for another day.\n\nBut I didn't. I sat on it quietly, convincing myself that I didn't have to worry about it.\n\nA week later, I was transferred to another squad, one nobody had ever heard of. Turns out they'd reviewed my helmet footage. Don't know what they saw but, apparently, it earned me a little promotion. \n\n\nHeh. some promotion.\n\nA file appeared on my bunkside one morning, explaining a lot to me. That the Office was aware of non-human threats and creatures. That certain people were much more attuned to anomalies of a paranormal or... different... nature. That they had specialised squads in place that would handle such entities on top of their regular assignments. And that I, lucky bastard that I am, was apparently the going to have to deal with these things much more regularly going forward. \n\nWhether I liked it or not.\n\nAnyways, I'm going to push send and take this to my higher ups. I like to think that I've done enough over the years that they won't make me disappear outright. And, hey, all thing go well, I'll be back again soon with official approval and will be able to tell you much more.\n\nBecause this?\n\nOh, this was just the tip of a whole messed up iceberg.",

        "text": "\n\nIt’s the first time I’m sharing this story. Some nights I can hear it in my head and I feel like it’s time I told someone about it hoping that some demons will leave me alone. \n\nEverything started with a challenge. It started when Mary and I decided to stay in the old abandoned house by the corner for a night. We had heard all the stories about the butcher but we weren’t worried at all. After all they’re just stories. Still that doesn’t mean that the old house wasn’t frightening. It was abandoned for many years now but it didn’t seem threatening. \n\nWe were all university friends just talking about stuff one night when the conversation went off to all the ghosts, demons and other paranormal stuff. It was Tony who started it. Not like it was the first time. Whenever we were together he always talked about the house and the butcher mainly because we lived almost opposite of the old house. So the old house was out topic once again. \n\n-So the old house…, said Tony.\n\n-Not again, said Mary. \n\n-Why? It’s such a bizarre story it could be true.\n\n-Yes it could. That’s why it’s called a story. That’s the beauty of urban legends, I said.\n\n-I agree, said Sofia.\n\n-Yeah whatever. But I want let y’all slide this time, said Tony.\n\n-Why not? It’s not like I have a problem with the house or that I have to visit it. It’s doesn’t affect me at all, said Mary.\n\n-Yeah sure. I bet you couldn’t stay a whole night in there, Tony said.\n\nMary lit a cigarette, inhaled, and then told Tony that she would do it but he would never ever again talk about all that paranormal stuff. The challenge was up. I felt like it was unfair if Mary went alone so I went with her. We then got up and got ready to spend a night at the old house. \n\nNow it’s time to tell you the butcher’s story. It is said that the house was owned by a family of four in the beginning of the 90s. Both kids were boys. Their lives were perfect. Everything was amazing for the family. Until one morning in the summer of 2000. It was then when 9 year old John was playing in the road outside the house. He was so happy that he wasn’t fast enough to avoid the car running over and crushing both of his legs. The mother heard the screaming and got out of the house to see her son being ran over by the car. Their car. And the driver? Her other son, 8 year old Theo. His hands were still on the steering wheel. Then their life went downhill. John had 2 amputated legs. He refuse to learn how to walk with mechanical ones. He spent the rest of his childhood bullying his brother. Late at night he would crawl downstairs to his brother’s room to show him his legs, or what was left of them. Young Theo was scared to got to his parents. That was his last mistake. One night, 18 months after the incident, he heard his brother crawling to his room again. This time he was holding a big knife he had gotten from the kitchen. He stabbed his brother. He cut him in so many pieces again and again that when he was done the knife wasn’t sharp anymore. Every corner of the room had blood covering it. Then John opened a door and got inside the walls of the house never to be seen again. Not until someone decided to spend a night in the house. Then he would show up once again. \n\nHave you ever heard of a more stupid story? I haven’t. So equipped with flashlight and chocolates, Mary and I headed to the old house. Once we stepped foot in we could smell blood and rust all over the place. We set up and Mary started talking.\n\n-Have I told you about Nick?\n\n-No you don’t need to.\n\n-Yeah but he was so….\n\nAnd she went on. For hours. Someone must tell her to learn when to stop. And then we heard the front door open. It was a man. \n\n-You stupid people haven’t realized in what trouble you are in. \n\nAnd with that he slammed the door.\n\n-Damn he must be staying in here and we took his house, I said.\n\n-Yeah haha. Ummmm by the way do you also feel the breeze on your neck?\n\nAnd then i heard it. Something was crawling towards us. And then one of the ceiling planks started creaking above us. And I’m sure I saw something in the corner. Maybe a rat? I tried to calm myself down and think that the butcher doesn’t exist and never did. But when Mary looked at me I could feel his presence in there with us. All these years he was hiding but now he is right next to me. I could see Mary looking over my shoulders and then….the breeze on my neck. I turned around to warn her but oh my God. OH MY GOD! Blood! Blood everywhere! I could hear Mary’s bones cracking and her being torn apart. I saw everything. But not with my eyes. It was an out of the body experience. The butchers shadow was above us. \n\nAnd then I ran out. I ran and ran and didn’t stop until I was back in my house. I tripped over 2 times. Both of them I got up and continued running. I got in my house. I looked myself in the mirror. Mary’s blood was all over me. My face, my hair, my arms, it was everywhere. I sat on my bed and thought about the house’s story. How things change with time. How a little boy who didn’t want to use mechanical legs and killed his brother and then decided to get in the house’s walls and stay there even if everyone left the house. No. That’s not what a little boy would do. It can’t be true. A little boy would go to his parents and explain what he had done. And they would understand. And for sure he would have gone to the best psychologist. Then he could live a normal life. That’s what I was thinking while bending and grabbing my mechanical legs that I had gotten so good at using that none could tell I was wearing them. That’s what would happen. He would tell it to his parents and they would find the solution. I know it because that’s what happened.",

        "text": "I always considered myself level-headed and rational, but one night in an allegedly haunted house proved me wrong. As a college student majoring in psychology, I eagerly volunteered for a study on the psychological effects of fear. The study was being conducted by a team of researchers from the university, in collaboration with the Grove Paranormal Society, a group of ghost hunters dressed all in black and equipped with an impressive array of tools.\n\nAs I arrived at the Gothic-style home, I was immediately struck by its eerie ambiance. The house was situated in a secluded area, surrounded by tall trees and overgrown bushes. The exterior was in a state of disrepair, with chipped paint and broken windows. I could feel a sense of dread creeping up my spine, but I reminded myself that this was all in the name of science.\n\nInside the house, the Grove Paranormal Society greeted me warmly, introducing me to their team members, each with their own unique skills and areas of expertise. They explained that they had been asked by the study's researchers to investigate the house and gather data on the psychological effects of fear.\n\nAt first, everything seemed ordinary. We explored the house while the team set up high-tech gear, such as infrared cameras, EMF detectors, digital recorders, and a laser grid system. But then, things started to get weird. Unexplainable noises and fleeting shadows caught my attention, and my heart began to race.\n\nThe team members began to act increasingly uneasy, and I could see the terror in their eyes. One of them even revealed a deep set of recent scratch marks on their back. I became convinced that there was something malevolent in the house with us.\n\nAs the night progressed, the activity grew more intense. Objects were hurled across the room, sometimes aimed directly at us, and the temperature dropped so low that we could see our breaths. The team members looked genuinely terrified, and my own fear began to rise. The house felt alive with an unseen presence, and I realized I had made a grave mistake by coming here.\n\nThen, I noticed something that made me doubt everything. The team members were communicating with each other through wireless earpieces and hand signals, and I realized that they were faking everything. They had set up all the scares, manipulating me and the other participants into a state of terror. I was both furious and terrified.\n\nWhen the night finally ended, the Grove Paranormal Society packed up their gear and left me alone in the haunted house. As I sat there, shivering in the dark, I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was still watching me, observing and evaluating my behavior. I had been a test subject in a cruel experiment, and I knew that I would never forget that night for the rest of my life.\n\nIn the end, I wasn't sure what was more frightening: the thought of a haunted house or the idea that humans are capable of manipulating others so easily. Whatever the case, I learned a valuable lesson that night and promised myself that I would never be so eager to face my fears again. As I walked out of the house, I realized that the study's researchers had accomplished their goal, and I had become a part of their experiment, a mere statistic in their quest for knowledge.",

        "text": "Before I go into this story, I want to preface that everything I’m telling you is 100% no bullshit. There is enough fake story’s on here. \n\nThis happened to me in my early teens. \nMy best friend growing up had this huge farm house in the middle of Virginia. It was VERY OLD and beautiful but also had a very dark history. In the house, there is a tunnel that lead to a underground room of sorts that was used for slaves to hide in 1800’s. And I’m 90% sure that some died down there while in hiding. So you can imagine the history and energy that fills the house. I always felt scared there. I never felt alone and wouldn’t go anywhere alone in the house, even just to grab something out of my room. Even the family was scared to stay there with no company because of the intense apparitions and experiences which I can get into another day. The rooms where massive and the entire house was white with honestly creepy vintage decor. There was even a cabinet of FUCKING Ventriloquist dolls upstairs. No joke. They where a really odd family honestly with lots of dark problems. Anyways, The second time I visited that house I was with my mom, my best friend at the time and her mom. It was a girls trip. One night I woke up and was so thirsty and the last thing I wanted to fucking do was go down stairs and get water. I was terrified I hated that house at night but my mom was dead asleep so I Literally sprinted downstairs with my head only looking at floor. I made my water in 5 seconds and when I made it too the stairs something compelled me to look at the GIANT glass doors that where in front of the stairs.  I was horrified but felt like I needed to look out the window. What I saw when I looked that window will haunt me for the rest of my life. I saw a man, as real as anything I’ve ever seen. It was pitch black outside with a huge bright moon. The man was all black ( like a silhouette) but because of the moon being so bright  I could clearly see his entire body. He was blacker than black like he stood out so much I 100% thought it was a trespasser. He was wearing a top hat and was un-humanly tall. Like 7 feet. My heart Litterally felt like it stopped beating. I felt like I was in a trace. I was so unexplainably horrified but I couldn’t look away. He was moving a little bit, almost like breathing. Then about 10 seconds later, he was gone. Disappearing into thin air. I fucking panicked and bolted Upstairs after I snapped out of my trance. I cried to my mom and was up all night. The next morning I told my friend and her mom about the experience and they where not shocked at all. As they had seen multiple full body apparitions in the house themselves. The nanny that worked for them even refused to go into some rooms of the house. I never went back to that house again.",

        "text": " A friend of mine had died close to the time when it happened. We had been very close with each other while we were in high school but he drifted a bit away when we went to college, in the last few years of his life I barely talked to him at all. A car accident was what did him in, they say he didn’t fill his brake fluid and the whole system went out on him, it was a fiery wreck altogether, I watched the tail end of it when it happened on the news.\n\nApparently, he had left me a box of stuff to give after death. A few weeks after I received the box, I could open it and look through the contents. There were a lot of items that he had borrowed from me in the past, even a twenty that had a note attached to it saying it was payback from when I got him lunch in our freshmen year of high school.\n\nIt made me choke up a little looking through the old box, it wasn’t until I gazed at its contents had the weight of the situation really hit me, that I was never going to see my friend again. Along with the many little knick-knacks that he had left me, there was a single cassette tape. It was small and black with a label on it that read “His Word.”\n\nI didn’t have a cassette player so I sat it off to the side and continued to look through. It wasn’t until about three in the morning that I finally went through the entire container. I was packing everything back up and my eyes fixed onto the cassette. What did His Word mean? I thought to myself before being snapped out of it by a ring of the doorbell.\n\nI got up and walked slowly to the front door. I stood still for a moment by the door. Suddenly they began to knock as well as ring the doorbell over and over until I opened the inside door but left the glass screen door closed as a barrier.\n\n“Good evening sir,” The man who stood outside my front door said.\n\n“Hello, why are you here?” I quickly asked without many pleasantries.\n\n“Well, why is anyone ever knocking on the door of a non-believer, I’m here to tell you of the words of our savior,” he made a transitional movement with his hands and arms between every word, seemingly to emphasize what he was saying, although the action was distracting, it was hard to focus on his face while his hands punctuated every sound from his lips.\n\n“And how would you know that I’m a non-believer?” I asked quickly.\n\n“If you had to ask why I was here then you are one,” he replied with his little flourishes between each syllable.\n\n“Well I go to church every sabbath, I am a believer sir!” I said slightly offended.\n\n“In your god yes, but in Mine no,” the man said, only making a single gesture in the middle of the sentence.\n\n“Well I’m not interested in a sermon right now sir, I respect your beliefs but I would like you to leave!” I shut the door on him and there was silence for a moment.\n\nThe knocking began once more after about five seconds as I began to walk away. I opened the door, more annoyed than anything.\n\n“You did not let me finish,” he said without a single movement.\n\n“What?” I asked peeved.\n\n“You have something I want!” he said, with accentuation at the end of the phrase.\n\n“And what would that be?” I asked.\n\n“Well a dear member of our chapel recently passed, we had let him borrow a relic for the purpose of conversation and it seems that after his death it has ended with you,” the man answered, resuming his movements.\n\n“Oh?” I replied, kind of tuning out the conversation a bit.\n\n“It should be a small cassette tape labeled something like ‘The Word’, or ‘Word of Himself’ or similar.”\n\nMy thoughts drifted for a moment, remembering the tape I found in the box. I had to fire something back quickly, quickly something was strange about this. A religious nut come at three in the morning to look for a cassette tape he magically knew I had.\n\n“I’m sorry, I do not have such things with me, now I would like it if you woul-” he cut me off quickly by saying.\n\n“Sir please, if you do not be reasonable with me, then we will have to become unreasonable, and none of us here really want that now do we?”\n\n“We?” I asked confused.\n\nThe man raised his left hand and balled it in about a second. Once the fist was created the headlights of a van lit up.\n\n“So, will you cooperate or will you be forced to?” he said lowering his hand.\n\nI slammed the door in his face and locked it. In an adrenaline-fueled rush I ran to every door and window and checked then locked them, I sat in the middle of the entrance room with my phone in case I needed it.\n\n“Well then,” the man said, “I suppose if violence is our only recourse, then may it be the one that we may take.”\n\nI heard a sharp snap and then many footsteps reaching my front door. A quick door jiggle let me breathe a single sigh of relief when a sigh of frustration came from the other side of the door. A moment of silence was maintained before a massive smashing sound came from the frame.\n\nIn the second I was surrounded before I could react. I tried to quickly dial nine-one-one but someone with a hammer hit me sharply before I could.\n\nI woke up in the morning, it was about seven and the sun had begun to rise.\n\n“I see you’re finally awake, good morning,” the lead man once said, I saw many others moving in and out of doors in a frantic searching method. I heard a yell from my room as someone screamed “I found it, preacher,” as the woman brought the man the tape.\n\n“Ah thank you, Audre,” the man took the tape in his hand.\n\nThe man got out a small cassette tape player and a small pair of headphones. I began to fight as he put them onto me.\n\n“In a few minutes, you will not even remember why you resisted, why you fought his word.” He said in a deep, whispering voice.\n\nHe placed the headphones upon my head and popped in the tape. Then in a fraction of a second, he closed the player and pressed the button to begin to play.\n\nFor the first few seconds, there was silence, this was eventually broken by the singing of a figure. I could not quite figure out the sound in my ears, after a moment, ah, a child, something like the choir, but different. A single voice, singing in a language my ears could not understand but my mind seemed to fully comprehend.\n\nIt was after this point that it truly began. I don’t know what it was. It was an unknowable tune, against the rules of music theory and notes. It was like a thousand voices screaming in the most beautifully painful chorus all at once. Like a billion birds ground into their most basic parts, their songs of pain and misery translated into the human tongue.\n\nAnguish, comfort, pain, pleasure, experience, life, death, all together, a sound of heaven and hell, a tune unheard by human ears but well known in the human mind. Out of the sublime white noise, a voice spoke to me in a language I could not understand, its instructions were clear but not to me.\n\nA single tear began to roll down my face as the beauty and hideous orchestra played.\n\n“It… is beautiful,” I said, trembling with each humble breath.\n\nIt felt as though I was floating upon the void of nothingness and yet I was feeling every human sensation, hearing every voice, tasting every flavor, smelling every pungent odor. Human experience played in a song, it was intoxicating.\n\nIn a moment I ripped from my toxic paradise.\n\n“PUT IT BACK, PLAY IT AGAIN,” I said, snapping at the preacher.\n\n“No no no little ram, I do not make sheep, you must do that yourself.”\n\nHe motioned to one of his followers, holding a skinning knife, and he cut me free, I was bound for hours so my faculties were not working at that moment.\n\n“Please, give me the noise, let me hear his voice,” I pleaded with him, arguing my case to his deaf ears.\n\n“No no sir, you have heard his word, if you wish to listen again then find us if you heard his voice truly you will know where to look.”\n\nWithin a moment he and his followers were gone with the blowing wind from the shattered door frame.\n\nMy bag is packed and I do know not where I’m going. In every step of purpose, I feel a guiding force taking me, carrying me to its source. I feel as though his very voice is in my head again. I do know not where I’m going. But I know how to get there, by following [the voice of god](https://www.reddit.com/r/Plague_692/).",

        "text": "This all started on one night where there was nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nMe and my wife of 8 years Jill had just finished watching Stranger Things for the night. \n\nAs I shut it off we kissed each other and said goodnight before burying our heads in the pillows.  \n\nI wasn’t the best sleeper.\n\nIt often took me a while to doze off so I would just lay there with my eyes shut for a considerable amount of time. \n\n“Hehehehehe” I heard whilst desperately trying to force myself to sleep. \n\n“What is it Jill?” I queried\n\nNo response. \n\nI thought I must’ve imagined her cackle. She was always asleep before me after all. \n\nAlso the giggle certainly didn’t sound like one of my wife’s ordinary chuckles. \n\nI made nothing of it and tried to sleep again. \n\nThe next day I asked Jill about it. \n\n“Did you see something funny on your phone last night before we slept?” \n\n“No? I just dozed off after we watched that episode” she replied with a hint of confusion. \n\nI was certain I heard her laugh but it was a quiet noise. Perhaps it was something outside that loosely resembled the sound of a person laughing quietly.\n\nI made nothing of it and carried about my day. \n\nI came home from work that day to find that there was an absurd amount of food delivered to the door of our house.\n\nMy brother Gavin would often deliver us food before showing up unannounced. \n\nIt was annoying cause he’d stay for hours but at least we got a bunch of free food out of it.\n\nBizarrely though Gavin didn’t turn up on this day. Maybe he’d ordered the food with the intention of coming to ours then something else popped up for him. \n\nDidn’t bother Jill and I much though. We gobbled most of the food for dinner without any regrets. \n\nWe even took the large amount of leftovers into our room to eat while we continued watching Stranger Things. \n\nAs we finished our episode I kissed her and said goodnight again. \n\nI shut my eyes and hoped that I’d fall asleep quickly but again I lay there for what felt like an hour. \n\n“Hehehehehe”\n\nMy eyes promptly widened as I heard the exact same noise again. \n\nI was now convinced that it was my wife laughing. I sat up out of bed and looked over to her as she was facing the other way. \n\nJill looked totally asleep so she must’ve been laughing at something in her sleep. \n\nI remember thinking about how odd it was. I’d never heard her talk in her sleep before never mind laugh in it. \n\nI smirked at the weirdness of it before laying back down and shutting my eyes again. \n\nThe next morning I attempted to make fun of my wife for it.\n\n“You know you’ve been giggling to yourself in your sleep like a weirdo.” \n\n“What?” Jill asked bewildered.\n\n“You’ve been chuckling faintly in your sleep. Why is that?”.\n\n“I don’t know? Must’ve been dreaming about something funny.” \n\nWe both set off for work shortly after. \n\nLater that day I came home absolutely exhausted. They had me working for 90 minutes longer than I should’ve been but I was willing to help out. \n\nI came home and Jill asked me about it straight away. \n\n“Jeez what took you so long?” \n\n“They wanted me to finish the Wednesday papers. Was a pain in the ass.”\n\n“Well you’re home now. Safe and sound”.  She said in a strangely stern tone. \n\nI went to sit on the couch and as I flopped onto it I noticed the pillow in the middle was gone. \n\nJill must’ve moved it which made me irrationally irritable. \n\nI let out a big sigh before shuffling my sluggish body over to the side of the couch. \n\nAfterwards we got into bed for the night and I was convinced my tiredness would let me fall asleep early. \n \n“Hehehehehe…hehehehehe” \n\nMy wife yet again was giggling and now it was slightly louder than the previous night.  \n\nNow I know you’ll call me out for it but I was irascible following a long tedious day of work. \n\nI decided to wake my wife up as the giggling was now slightly maddening me. \n\n“Jill, I’m glad you’re enjoying your comedy show in your dreams but I really need to sleep.”\n\n“Huh?” She confusingly asked as she rubbed her sleepy eyes. \n\nI rolled my eyes and flung my head onto the pillow in an exaggerated tone like a child would before getting up for school.\n\nThe following day I was yet again working overtime when I really didn’t want to. \n\nI just felt so tired. It was as if every day was draining the life energy out of me. \n\nI got home in a state of utter fatigue. \n\nI opened the door to see a huge stack of unopened food yet again. \n\nJill was sat on the couch watching some game show she used to like after work. \n\nI wearily wandered into the kitchen to get some cutlery for our food before even saying hi to my wife. \n\nMost of the drawers for some reason had been left open by Jill. \n\nFor something so little I wanted to put my fist through the wall. How hard can it be to shut the drawers after you use them? \n\nMy unfair and dreary mood couldn’t fathom it as I grabbed a set of knives and forks from the cutlery. \n\nI went back into the living room and sat next to Jill not even bothering to say a word.\n\nWe took some of the leftovers in the room with us again in the night. \n\nWe made quick work of them before turning off the lights to go to bed. \n\nNot long after it happened again. \n\n“Hehehehehe…hehehehehe”\n\nI yet again heard her sadistic giggling. \n\nIt was so creepy to just hear her laughing to herself like a maniac every single night in total darkness. \n\nI rolled her over and used my phone as a faint source of light because I wanted to see what she looked like as she laughed. \n\nSurprisingly she didn’t awake when I manoeuvred her onto her other side to face me. \n\nI sat there for a few minutes but she didn’t laugh. \n\nMy eyes began to close as I was almost overcome with tiredness. \n\nSuddenly however..\n\n“Hehehehehe…hehehehehe.”\n\nMy heart froze. \n\nI was looking my wife right in the face when the noise was made. \n\nMy wife was not giggling. \n\n“HEHEHEHEHE…HEHEHEHEHE” \n\nI began to hyper-ventilate as the giggles became frighteningly loud.\n\nI could now make out the source of the sound. \n\nI turned on the flashlight on my phone. \n\nI leaned over the side of my bed. \n\nI lifted the covers as I peered my head upside down underneath our bed. \n\nWhat greeted me was fierce hazel eyes that looked directly into mine. \n\nA red haired woman with some of the food we’d been taking into our room was hiding under our bed. \n\nI could see that the cushion that was missing from our couch had been carefully hidden under the bed. \n\nMost frighteningly, I saw pieces of our cutlery that had been taken from our drawers.\n\nThe red-haired woman was grinning at me but during this few-second long stand-off her mouth opened more and more. \n\nShe was smiling with so much joy like I was a friend of hers that she hadn’t seen in years. \n\nI then heard the sound that had been creeping me out for the last 4 nights. \n\n“HEHEHEHEHE” she pervertedly giggled as her frozen open mouthed expression caused her to drool onto the floor. \n\nI shouted so loud my wife awoke.\n\nThe still-grinning woman under the bed then grabbed a knife before swinging it at my dangling head.\n\nFortunately I lifted myself just in time before the blade could connect with my face. \n\n“JILL! RUN! GET OUT!”\n\nWe both jolted out the room as the red-haired woman began to climb out from under where we slept.\n\nWe locked ourselves in the toilet. \n\nJill and I hugged each other as we both cried. We were both in a state of total fear and panic. \n\nAll we could hear were thuds of this deranged woman trying to break down the door as she constantly giggled.\n\n“HEHEHEHHEHE…HEHEHEHEHEHE…HEHEHEHEHE”.\n\nI called the police as we prayed to god that the toilet door would hold. \n\nAfter what felt like hours they arrived and caught the giggling maniac banging on our toilet door. \n\nFortunately Jill and I were both okay. \n\nA few weeks on from this and Jill and I are doing alright so you needn’t panic! \n\nIt turns out this crazy woman had been living in our home for at least 4 days. \n\nShe’d stolen our cutlery whilst we were out and also had taken a pillow from our couch to use under our bed. \n\nNow here’s the freaky part. Know how I mentioned that we kept getting lots of food delivered to our house. \n\nInitially we thought it was my brother Gavin however my wife noticed some really bizarre activity on her Just Eat account. \n\nIt turns out this psychopath had been pre-ordering food for the following day using her phone. \n\nShe must’ve grabbed my wife’s finger while she was asleep and used it to unlock the device. \n\nJill and I are still pretty shaken about it but we are moving on from it just fine. \n\nI didn’t sleep very well before and as you can imagine that hasn’t exactly gotten better.\n\nI’m just so paranoid that at any moment during these gloomy nights I’m going to hear those giggles again..",

        "text": "Ben Martinson. \n\nDirector for Site 19-24-47\n\nLocation on earth: [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\nHi, I'm Benjamin Martinson, most of my coworkers call me Ben, or Martin, or some pun. I prefer Min.\n\nI work for the SCP foundation, as Project director for new Site 19-24-47. I'm basically Manager with twice as many responsibilities as Manager. I oversee most of not all tests with entities held held here.\n\nIn case you didn't read the title, this place doesn't exist. \"But then how are you posting this?\" Because this place is kept so safeguarded by the foundation that it *practically* doesn't exist. That doesn't mean it doesn't.\n\nEveryone who is aware of this Site that doesn't work here, like me, or isn't select 05 members, that being 05-3 and 05-4, are given Class 0 Amnestics. That's the highest level of memory wiping stuff the foundation has, I think. I've never had to administer the stuff myself, thank god.\n\nNow I'll explain what this Site is. This place contains SCP's that aren't really containable by normal means. This includes SCP [DATA EXPUNGED], which has teleportation abilities that are random and uncontrollably, and SCP [DATA EXPUNGED], which can break basically anything. Basically we contain the uncontainable.\n\nThe exact location of this place is kept a secret, but I can say that it's in a place that isn't really of this world, aka, another dimension. It basically nullifies any and all intention of hostility an entity or person or animal could ever have. We've labeled this place, \"Babys first Dimension.\"\n\nI'll go ahead and share some things about this place that I ain't supposed to.\n\nThis place runs off a completely different categorizing system for the entities. However the threats they pose are essentially the same. The Levels go as:\n\nAsil\n\nGambit\n\nPyre\n\nSintil\n\n\nJust like a Euclid is up for debate on whether it should be moved down a rank or up a rank, A Gambit is left to decide based on testing results if it should go up or down a level.\n\nTake for example, Gambit #21, the martian man. He's basically something that can phase through anything, well except the dimensions walls. If he phases through organic matter the effects vary, from wanting nothing more that to burn their skin, to wanting to hug a cat with enough force to collapse a small building. We can't decide if it's too dangerous enough to be considered a Pyre, but it's not been a Gambit for the longest time. Also, his actual name, is Mark. Underwhelming I know, but to be fair it was translated from an alien language so maybe his name is cooler when he says it.\n\nLast week we tested our newest entry into the Site, we're calling it, \"Gods plan\" which is, as the name implies, the literal paper with gods plans on it (take that atheists), and upon looking at it for no lest than 2 seconds, the victim goes completely and utterly insane, with no healing being able to help, no therapy, no shock treatment, nothing can help the poor person recover. It's recently been moved here because last week in Site [DATA EXPUNGED], it disappeared from the Site, and was later recovered in San Antonio. It essentially teleports randomly to a random location in the world. It's been found to mostly teleport to large crowds of people, which would instantly think, \"what's this here\", read it, then go insane. Does it do this on purpose, is someone somewhere controlling it? What we do know is that it doesn't teleport in this dimension because it's not on earth, and it can't teleport to nothingness, and can't teleport more than 1 light-year away. Which this site is more than 2 light-years away from earth. I don't really know how that works either, so don't ask me. It's currently classed as Asil, but I personally think it should be a Gambit just because it makes people go insane 2 seconds after they look at it, but hey, I'm not 05 so I don't really get a say in the matter.\n\nThe test itself, went about like this:\n\"Ooo what's this pretty paper?\", On multiple people.\n\nAnyway exactly 30 D-Class went insane. Then were properly shot and disposed of back on earth.\n\nI think that's all I'll reveal for now, so good day to you, and I'll probably never be able to tell another thing about Site 19-24-47, as I'll probably be just some normal Jersey citizen by next Wednesday. See yah never, I guess?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11lna1n/what_really_happens_when_cordyceps_infects_humans/",
        "text": "By now, you've probably heard of the popular TV show that portrays the Cordyceps fungus infecting humans and turning them into zombie-like creatures. But let me tell you, the real-life scenario is much more terrifying.\n\nI work in a lab that specializes in plant and fungi experimentation. Our primary focus is on developing new drugs for the pharmaceutical industry, including everything from anti-aging remedies to creating the next “blue pill”.\n\nHowever, we also received significant funding from the Defense Department, and their research requirements are much more sinister.\n\n\"How are the new test subjects doing?\" Steven, our lab supervisor, asked as he approached me carrying a clipboard. He gestured towards the eight test rooms in front of us. \n\n“Number four looks promising. And I think six and seven are starting to show signs”, I said, looking up from my workstation.\n\nInside the eight test rooms were five men and two women, one in each room, plus a single empty room. It was left empty after a rogue chimpanzee from the earlier phase experiments had managed to escape its cage and break the pass-through window, which is used to transfer materials and instruments between sterile and nonsterile rooms.\n\nSteven nodded, a look of excitement on his face. \"Excellent. We're getting closer”.\n\nIn the cages, test subject one, two, three, and five, appeared to be behaving somewhat normally, pacing their small 8 by 8 cage, or talking to themselves. However, test subject four had remained motionless now for about two hours, lying on his side with his back to us with his chest rises and falls his only movement. Meanwhile, test subjects six and seven had recently become lethargic, barely responding to the electric shocks administered to their enclosure.\n\nAll of the test subjects had been exposed to a variety of chemically altered cordyceps fungus. Typically, cordyceps cannot infect humans due to our higher internal temperatures, among other factors. However, by modifying the fungus’s genetic makeup, we were close to changing that. \n\n“Let’s keep a close eye on those three, report back to me if there are any updates.”\n\n“Will do,” I replied. \n\nWith that, Steven left the room and I returned to monitoring the test subjects' vitals on the screens. Interestingly, subjects four, six, and seven had significantly elevated heart rates, almost 50% higher than the others. Additionally, their endorphin levels, the body's natural painkillers, were unusually high, indicating that they were experiencing intense pain, despite showing none of the typical outward signs.\n\n“What do you make of this?”, I asked my lab partner, Mike, while pointing to the screen with my pen.\n\nHe looked over the vitals on my screen. “It looks like they are in intense pain. Those sorts of levels would be what I would expect to see if someone were on fire”, he said dryly.\n\n“Yes, that’s what it looks like to me as well”, I replied.\n\nOur test subjects were some of the worst criminals our Government had locked up. The advantage of working for the Defense Department, especially where we required human subjects, was there was no shortage of forgotten criminals – terrorists, murderers, and other violent offenders. These individuals were typically housed in maximum security prisons and were serving lengthy sentences, often for life.\n\nWhile the use of human subjects in scientific experiments is, controversial, and subject to strict ethical guidelines, the Defense Department saw the need to conduct these tests outside the normal guidelines. Therefore, the rules no longer applied, and we had the green light to do whatever we needed to do to get the result.\n\n“Let’s do a blood test and see if the troponin levels have increased on subject four, six and seven”, I said to Mike.\n\nMike nodded and left his seat to get dressed in his hazmat suit.\n\nWith the heart rate and endorphin levels so extremely elevated, I thought it could be possible that the Cordyceps is already spreading through the test subjects, paralyzing them while simultaneously causing immense pain. If my theory was right, then not only will we have successfully managed to infect the first even human with Cordyceps, but it would have taken effect within three hours of exposure. \n\nCordyceps is a type of parasitic fungus that primarily infects ants, as well as other insects such as beetles and caterpillars. The infection process begins when a spore of the Cordyceps fungus lands on the exoskeleton of an ant.\n\nOnce the spore is attached to the ant, it begins to grow long, branching filaments that penetrate the ant's exoskeleton and start to invade its body. As the fungus grows, it releases chemicals that alter the ant's behavior, causing it to become disoriented and leave its colony.\n\nThe fungus continues to grow inside the ant's body, eventually replacing its organs and tissues with a mass of fungal cells.\n\nWe are not stupid – we know exactly why the Defense Department would want to, essentially, weaponize this. We do this because we are scientists, and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge in further understanding the world around us is fundamental to our role.\n\nNow fully suited up, Mike entered the first test subjects room, number four, and activated the cage squeeze function. The cage started to close in on the test subject, squeezing in from front and back. This process meant Mike could get up and close to the test subject without risk to himself. But just as the cage closed in tight, locking the subject in place, his skin burst from multiple areas, and sharp, dagger-like spores fired out in all directions.  \n\nPanicking, Mike turned and ran for the door he just came through. I reached for the emergency lockdown button to prevent him from leaving and hit it a second too late. Mike ran out into the connecting corridor, screaming in pain. Some of the spores had penetrated his suit and were now drilling their way into his body, as Mike screamed and clawed at the holes, ripping his hazmat suit while trying to grab them out.\n\nI activated the alarms and locked down my door as Mike thrashed about in the corridor. A few minutes later I heard security come running down the hall and yell at Mike to get down, but he was in too much pain to respond. The security guards, continued to yell at Mike, tasers drawn, when Mike suddenly started running at them. Without flinching, the both Security Guards tasered Mike, dropping him onto the floor. They then slowly approached him to restrain him, when suddenly Mikes body tore open and fired out more dagger-like spores.\n\n“Impossible!” I yelled at the camera, as I watched both guards get hit by the spores.\n\nThe Cordyceps had multiplied and spread within minutes. The guards, now themselves in agonizing pain, ran back through the doors that they came from and into one of the main lab halls where more than a dozen researchers were working. Watching through the cameras, I saw the researchers panicking and trying to escape via the now-locked doors, as the two security guards thrashed around. Then, just like Mike, the security guards’ skin split open, firing multiple spores around the room. Most of the researchers had now been infected, and those that avoided being struck by the spores weren’t so lucky a few minutes later, as more spores went flying around the room. Soon, every researcher was infected, screaming and writhing in agony.\n\nI stayed in my locked room for hours, watching as the infected slowly stop moving. One by one they collapsed to the floor or on tabletops, and I watched in horrified amazement as fungal growths started to sprout from the holes in their skin. I eventually put on a hazard suit, unlocked the door, and left the office, slowly walking toward Mikes’s still body. By now he was covered in fungal stalks and mushroom-like growths, and one had even grown right through his eye socket, popping his eyeball out to the side. But that wasn’t the worst thing. The worst thing was his other eye, which was fixated on me, had an expression of sheer terror and agony. He was alive, paralysed, and appeared to be feeling every horrifying moment as the Cordyceps slowly dissolved his internal organs and replaced them with fungal growths.\n\n“I’m Sorry Mike” I whispered, genuinely upset at his predicament. Mike was a good guy, but I knew I couldn’t help him. The Cordyceps was devouring his internal organs as he lay there, so I did what any good scientist would do – I carefully took a sample of the growth from his eye socket, and a blood sample. I then carefully attached a mobile heart rate monitor to his arm through one of the ripped holes Mike had made earlier, and then slowly backed away back into the secure room, locked the doors, and awaited my rescue. The data I could get from Mike would no doubt prove invaluable for our next attempt.\n\nSo here I wait. It has taken longer than I thought to be rescued, it has now been about 60 hours since Mike got infected. The bodies are now unrecognizable lumps of fungal growths, and Mikes heart finally stopped registering a pulse around 15 hours ago, which means he was alive for 2 whole days after the infection. He did have multiple heart attacks during that time, no doubt from the pain of different organs turning to slush, but somehow he was kept alive. I have tried the internal lines multiple times, but no one is answering. It’s probably a security protocol I am unaware of. And I can’t see the cameras outside this part of the facility, but I am sure they are just taking extreme precautions, after all, the last thing anyone would want is for this to escape the lab. But I’m sure everything is fine. \n\nAt least, I hope it is.",

        "text": "Like most people, I’d never witnessed supernatural events or paranormal experiences. I guess you’d describe me as a non-believer or skeptic. At least I was before now. I’m a regular guy who works a 9 to 5 job and has a pretty mundane existence most of the time. I live alone and rarely have visitors or parties. To further clarify, my apartment building is brand new. As a matter of fact, I’m the very first tenant for this unit. Nothing I could point to would lend itself to explaining the story I’m about to reveal. \n\nI don’t know how else to convince anyone reading this I wasn’t high, drunk, or simply dreamed the entire episode. Believe what you wish. I know in my heart I was fully awake and lucid when it occurred. I’m positive what I heard wasn’t my imagination, a potent dream, or a lifelike hallucination. \n\n“The way out, is through the void.”\n\nI immediately sat up and looked around in the darkness of my bedroom in bewilderment for the source of the mysterious directive. A number of emotions ran through me. Not the least of which was confusion and fear.  ‘Who’, or ‘what’ was behind the strange statement and what did it mean? Was ‘out’ a vague euphemism for death? Did it mean the final end of consciousness and pain? Maybe I’d overshot the runway of overthinking. It’s amazing how many things the human mind is capable of in just a few seconds. \n\nThe cryptic sentence could have a simple meaning. Not everything had to be a deep, metaphysical metaphor. Once the realization that I should be totally alone in my home at that late hour washed over me, my thoughts immediately migrated to wondering if I was in actual danger, or had it been lucid sleep. If it was only a dream, then I was safe and psyching myself out for no reason. If it was a genuine external message from an unknown source, then I really wasn’t alone! The hair on my arm began to stand on end as the possibility expanded. Goose pimples covered my nervous flesh. I felt paranoid and highly vulnerable. \n\nAfter the surge of adrenaline began to dissipate, I started to feel foolish. No one would break into my house to whisper an open-ended enigma in my ear. That was a unlikely notion. I began to relax. As a soothing mechanism, my higher logic directed my thoughts to the most rational and calming possibility. It was all a dream. Just as my heartbeat was returning to normal and I was about to close my eyes to lie back down, the chilling phrase ‘from beyond’ repeated. \n\n“The way out, is through the void.”\n\nI shot out of bed and raced for the bathroom. I’m not a wealthy man so the locked door and confined space served as my unofficial ‘panic room’. Whatever level of relief it afforded was short-lived. \n\n“The way out, is through the void.”\n\nThe unexplained speaker was very close now. My bathroom isn’t large and whatever entity kept offering me that nebulous pearl of wisdom was right there inside the confined space with me. While it was repeated in a calm, emotionless monotone, the acoustics magnified both the volume and timber. I didn’t dare turn on the light. I don’t think my heart could’ve handled seeing what was there with me. \n\nInstead, I unlocked the door and fled from my psychological tormentor; blindly running into walls and furniture in the dark. Ordinarily I’d know the internal layout of my home like the back of my hand but I was too rattled by the abstract invasion to focus. This may seem like a bizarre statement to make, but the lack of specific threat or intent from my unseen intruder terrified me more than if I’d heard a roaring chainsaw. That would’ve at least signaled homicidal intent and given me full motivation to flee to spare my life. My surreal experience was something else entirely. The repeated statement was delivered with a cool, calm demeanor; and yet the implication and intentions were intangible. \n\nI fumbled around until I found my front door and unlocked it. Outside in the cool, predawn air; I felt my sense of calm returning as I put some distance between myself and the invisible sage of wisdom sequestered in my house. I was too frazzled to care if any of my neighbors saw me wandering the neighborhood in my nightshirt and underwear. Modesty be damned, I was away from the vague threat; or so I thought.\n\n“The way out, is through the void.”\n\nI almost screamed when it was repeated again. I was a half kilometer from my ‘haunted’ residence and yet the unseen phantom was keeping full pace with my hasty retreat. There was no safe haven. My stockinged feet were soaked from the balmy dew on the grass and the brisk, cool air burned my aching lungs. If there had been any question before of my consciousness, it was fully gone now. I was absolutely awake and unable to escape my insistent messenger. Not once had it occurred to me to reply back. That was previously a bridge too far. In ‘fight or flight’ response scenarios, I’d obviously chosen ‘flight’ but that clearly wasn’t working.\n\nChanging tactics to better adapt, I found the courage to address my unseen orator for clarification but then stumbled with what exactly to ask. Was it similar to a mythical genie situation with just three wishes? Was there merely a limited potential for exchange with this shadow keeper of the void? I wasn’t certain of the parameters and didn’t want to waste the unusual opportunity on pointless formalities. \n\nThe best way forward was to ask general questions that verified broad answers. Hopefully I would receive a response. For all I knew, the messenger’s entire vocabulary consisted of those seven ominous words. I felt like a damned fool for wandering the darkness of my neighborhood in my nightshirt and wet stockings but it was a first for many things. I didn’t know exactly where to address my lurking phantom. \n\nI raised my head slightly and asked out-loud: “What are you?” Luckily, I didn’t have to wait long. \n\n“You know what I am.”\n\nAny reassurance I might’ve felt from receiving a response to my query was short lived. The implications were stark. I didn’t know the identity of this invisible entity addressing me with any certainty, but I had my suspicions; and none of them made me feel better. With such grim possibilities of what was speaking to me in mind, I couldn’t bring myself to articulate them. Suspecting terrible things was better than knowing. It was denial in its purest form. \n\n“Is ‘the void’ that you speak of; what we call ‘death’?”; I finally asked with lingering dread. \n\n“Yessssss.”; came the sobering reply. \n\nI swallowed hard. My wet feet were freezing in the chilly night air but that’s not something you should ever focus on, when ‘the master of the pit’ solicits a solo audience with you. I tried to find the silver lining in the morose, mostly one sided conversation. \n\n“Are you saying that when I die and pass through ‘the void’, I’ll achieve immortality?”\n\nI could hardly believe I’d summoned the courage to ask such a leading, highly-optimistic question to my grim, unseen companion. My desire to know the truth about ‘the great beyond’ finally outweighed my utter terror about the situation. I think they call that ‘fools courage’. \n\nA telling, morbid silence fell over my cadence in the woods. I’d always been physically alone in the eerie predawn moonlight but suddenly I felt I’d been personally abandoned for asking THE question. Minutes elapsed in awkward silence. When no response came to my query for clarification, I finally had an answer to the meaning of what ‘out’ meant in the repeated refrain. At least, as definitively as I was going to receive from ‘the one of few words’. \n\nMaybe ‘it’ wasn’t allowed to answer that monumental question about what, if anything comes after this life. More likely, few ever had the courage to ask when their opportunity came. Either way, I wasn’t about to do anything hasty to accelerate my ‘exit’ through the void to find out, no matter how frequently my morose night visitor suggests it. \n\nIt will come soon enough.",

        "text": "Have you ever heard the story of Princess Death? Maybe someone would start telling scary stories when you were a kid at summer camp or getting stoned in an abandoned house. Bloody Mary. The guy with the hook for a hand. Then someone would ask if you heard of Princess Death, the rockstar that killed her fans, to make a deal with the devil. You know the story. If you light a candle and play Princess Death's record, she'll grant any wish but take someone close to you in return. The trick, of course, is finding one of her records, but I have a copy.\n\nYou see, back in the day, I used to be a roadie for Princess Death. She was pretty impressive, but unfortunately, everyone has forgotten her music, and all that remains is what's believed to be an urban legend, but I was there, I saw it, I know it's true, and I'm afraid of what's next.\n\n Princess had gotten this new manager who set her up for this headlining gig and filled her head with nonsense about having to have the most unforgettable stage show ever. He told her to think Altamont. Think Station Nightclub. Think Woodstock '99. \n\nI told her it was a bad idea, but the manager had already convinced her it was her ticket to immortality. I would have backed away if I knew I was damning myself in the process.  \n\nDo you know how hard it is to get four pounds of Fentanyl?\n\nThere were four opening acts, and we had eight minutes to set the stage. I was ready with an oil barrel filled with Fentanyl, soap, and water on a dolly prepared to roll. I wore a tyvek suit for safety.\n\nWhen the third band finished, I rolled the barrel out and froze at the size of the audience. So many people with no idea what I was about to do to them. \n\nAfter the barrel was out and I set the blower on top, I scrambled for the band's gear. Princess looked nervous, but her new manager assured her people would talk about her for lifetimes.\n\nI told her manager I had everything set. He wondered if there was anything special I wanted. I asked if I could get a case of High Life. He chuckled and told me good luck with the show. That's how fast you could damn your immortal soul.\n\nThe show started, and Princess tore through song after song. The crowd loved every minute. I watched from the side of the stage with the remote and waited for my cue. \n\nAs she hit her big high note, she smiled at me. \n\nI pressed the button, and out of the barrel blew out thousands of bubbles. Big ones, small ones all floating like snowflakes out into the crowd. It was magic. Her fans were in awe. The lighting board dude killed it with the way he lit them. You could tell Princess knew she was making history.\n\nThen the screaming started.\n\n You ever see War of the Worlds, where the aliens fire the ray gun, and people vanish? Imagine that, but with bubbles. As soon as a bubble burst on someone, they collapsed and stopped breathing. Some people had multiple bubbles popped on them and sent them into violent seizures. People foamed at the mouth, turned blue, and passed out. By the time people realized what was happening, it was too late. It's tough for that many people to coordinate an exit. \n\nI stood there with the remote in my hand and my mouth wide open, unable to wrap my mind around what was happening. The manager had such a big smile on his face. It was terrifying. That horrible smile burned into my mind.\n\nPrincess stopped playing and just watched the crowd fall like dominoes. You know that scene from Avengers where Thanos snaps his fingers, and everyone pops? It was a lot like that, only worse, and with bubbles. \n\nThen the air conditioning turned on. \n\nThat killer swarm of bubbles blew back at the stage. No one was safe. Everyone on stage fell, one pop at a time. Princess stood there like an angel. It was like the bubbles were purposely flying around her. She was glowing. It was her big moment. \n\nThen the bubbles fell on her, and so did she.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was the last one standing. Me, in my sweaty plastic suit, with my thumb on the trigger. Well, I thought I was alone. The new manager, the guy with the weird single name, walked over and handed me a case of High Life. He smiled and tipped his hat, and walked away. \n\nThe beer wasn't even cold. \n\nI've never thought much about the afterlife, but I did after getting a terminal diagnosis. Not everyone knows if there is a God, Heaven, or Hell, but I did and knew where I was going. Maybe that's why I kept this record after all these years. Who will she take when I play? Will she remember me? I'm almost too scared to find out, but then I remember that manager's smiling face and think anything is better than an eternity with him.",

        "text": "“I’ll miss this place. Our house is more than bricks and mortar. It’s *us.*”\n\nI can’t stop thinking about that. Anna said it before she moved permanently into the hospital.\n\nFrom the day of my wife’s passing in late 2019, our home bellyached persistently — and its belligerent groans were always more sinister than the sounds of settling foundations. They almost sounded like wails.\n\n“I saw Mum blow me a kiss in the mirror last night,” Cassie, my daughter, recently told me.\n\nI humoured my twelve-year-old to aid her grieving process, but I never really believed in ghosts. Not until the horrifying events of this past weekend.\n\nMy son, Jake, is a good kid, but he makes some terrible decisions. That’s his prerogative. He’s eighteen, after all. But the trouble with teenagers is that they have no foresight. That’s why Jake never expected the caller we received on Saturday evening. And it was up to me to protect him.\n\n“Hello, Mr Grant,” The man at the door said.\n\nHe was a burly fellow with a leather jacket and an unkempt, grey-tinged beard. His hands were balled into fists, and I immediately knew that trouble had come knocking.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, how rude of me,” The man chuckled. “I’m Warren Jones, and your son owes me two grand.”\n\nI froze in fear. I knew Jake had picked up some bad habits since Anna’s death, but I didn’t realise he’d been mingling with loan sharks. I’d seen the stoned, vacant look in his eyes when he got home in the early hours of the morning. I knew he’d been taking drugs. But every attempt to communicate with him had fallen on deaf ears.\n\n“I have no idea why my son owes you so much money, but I… I can pay you whatever he owes,” I promised.\n\nThat was a mistake. I saw the greedy glint in the barbarian’s eyes as he realised he’d set his sights upon a cash cow. Warren could see that I was desperate to protect my family.\n\n“Trouble is…” The tormenter began. “Interest. Cost of living crisis. You know how these things work. See, it *was* two grand. Now it’s three.”\n\n“Fine,” I firmly said, barricading the doorway to my home. “Three grand. If you give me your bank details, Mr Jones-”\n\nThe man cackled manically, holding his split sides in faux amusement and wiping his eye for added effect.\n\n“Oh, Mr Grant,” Warren chuckled. “In my line of business, we operate on a strict cash-only policy.”\n\n“Okay,” I said, hand shakily clutching my front door. “If you let me grab my coat, I can drive to the bank and-”\n\n“- See, the problem with me letting you drive into town is that you might feel inclined to stop at the police station on the way,” Warren said. “Course, I gave you a fake name, so they wouldn’t really have any information on me. Still, my employer isn’t a fan of external interference.”\n\nI heard a door creak upstairs. I knew Jake was on the landing, listening to the conversation. The menacing grin on Warren’s face told me that he meant my son harm. I was fearfully racing for an answer, and then I realised I’d overlooked something.\n\nThe cash in Anna’s office.\n\nI beckoned for Warren to follow me, and the lion hungrily slinked into our den. I hadn’t stepped foot in Anna’s office since she died, and it sickened me that I was finally being coerced into doing so by that thuggish lout. But what choice did I have? Warren kept his hand in the pocket of his jacket, and I was fairly certain that he had a weapon. I had to protect my family.\n\nAs I inched open the door to my wife’s study, I flicked the light switch. Nothing. The lightbulb had blown. Through the slanted slats of the blinds, however, the day’s dying rays of sunlight spilled into the room.\n\nDust-covered books and furnishings were what I had expected. What I had *not* expected was a spider plant that had taken on a life of its own — the desk plant had sprouted long leafy limbs, which were covering most of the floor and walls of the study. A distant memory returned to me.\n\n“I’m going to be lost without you,” I cried to Anna in the hospital.\n\n“*Without* me? You’re not getting rid of me this easily,” Anna teased. “I’ll still be keeping an eye on you. Make sure you water my spider plant.”\n\n*Looks like it didn’t need watering*, I thought. *How is it still alive?*\n\n“Fuck me,” Warren gasped. “This room’s a relic. Let’s hope you’ve got a treasure trove in here.”\n\nI frantically rummaged through the drawers of my late wife’s desk, brushing spidery strands of greenery out of the way. And then I remembered that the money wasn’t there anymore. It was our emergency fund, and the emergency had been Anna’s experimental cancer treatment — a last-ditch effort.\n\nI gulped. “I, erm, need to think…”\n\nWarren growled. “No. You need to *pay* me, Mr Grant, or I’ll make little Jakey pay.”\n\n“Fuck you,” I spat.\n\nWarren’s eyes glistened, as if I’d finally given him the invitation he had desired since the moment he stepped foot on my porch. The invitation to do harm.\n\n“What was that, Mr Grant?” Warren asked, taking a step towards the desk.\n\nThe floorboards strained beneath his weight, and his hand finally slid out of his jacket pocket. As I had feared, he was clutching a weapon. A large kitchen knife. The shadowy figure crept towards me, chortling cruelly.\n\n“When I’ve finished you, I’ll take *great* pleasure in killing your boy as slowly and painfully as possible,” Warren promised.\n\nHe lunged at me, and I felt a primal, unyielding fear as I watched the steely blade plunge into the lower-left side of my abdomen. I screamed in agony, wrestling weakly with the hefty man as he shoved me into the desk, twisting the blade deeper and deeper into my torso.\n\nHe whispered. “I won’t kill your girl. I’m not a monster. I just have to make a point, okay?”\n\nAnd then the door to the study slammed shut. Warren twisted around, but there was nobody else in the room with us. My eyesight was unfocused, and I could feel the life fading from my body, but I know what I saw. The spider plant limbs, coating most of the room, started to move.\n\n“What the fuck?” Warren gasped, stepping back from me.\n\nI clutched the knife in my abdomen, wanting to look down at the damage, but too transfixed by the inexplicable spectacle before me. The spider plant constricted Warren’s ankles, and he screeched in terror as the leafy appendages climbed up his body.\n\n“What is this?” He screamed. “How are you…”\n\nThe man screeched in excruciating pain as the leaves of the spider plant tore holes in his flesh, creeping beneath his skin. I could only watch in horror as the green fingers of Anna’s seemingly-eternal plant protruded from Warren’s orifices — they poured from his eye sockets, bringing trickles of blood with them.\n\nThe man gagged as the plant burst from his mouth, having crept up his throat. His body spasmed for a few more seconds, then his movements slowed. A few tears spilled from his eyes, and, finally, he was still. He was dragged into the wall of greenery, concealed forever.\n\nMoments before I passed out, I think I saw my wife standing in the doorway — her phantom form smiling at me. Simultaneously beautiful and terrifying.\n\nWhen I woke, I was in the hospital. Jake and Cassie were in floods of tears, and my son asked what had happened to the loan shark. I told him we wouldn’t be hearing from him again. But Jake is worried that Warren’s employer will come sniffing.\n\nI’m not scared for my family. I’m scared for any fool that steps foot into Anna’s house.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "This happened around either May or June of 2010.\n\nI was spending the day with my future wife (who unfortunately passed last year) and her family on Mount Lemon, which is north of Tucson, Arizona.  There’s a road leading up to a town that’s about 25 miles long and has a fairly steep grade.  Along the way the land changes from desert to pine forest.  It’s absolutely beautiful and one of the most challenging cycling routes in the world.  Our day, however, was to go geocaching using a small GPS that only told direction and distance to the cache.\n\nAfter several hours of stopping along the road, hiking a bit and finding several of these geocaches, we made it to the small town at the end of the road.  We had a late lunch and we planning to go back down but my wife pointed out there was still time to find one more cache before it got dark.  All of us agreed and saw there was one fairly close, less than two miles away.  Her family had a small sedan at the time and when we saw it was down the dirt road on the backside of the mountain, we parked and started walking there.  It was only a little over half a mile at this point so we didn’t think anything of it.\n\nThis “road” goes along a fairly steep section so there are lots of switchbacks.  After what was probably an hour the GPS said we still had just under a quarter mile to go.   My wife, her father and I were having no trouble, but her sister who was 13 or 14 at the time and her mom were not as fast so the pace was quite slow.  Finally we got within twenty feet of the cache.  A dense patch of forest with lots of fallen trees and underbrush.  The sun was really low now, maybe even already setting.  It was getting dark, fast, and we still hadn’t found this cache.\n\nI looked at my wife, pointing out we didn’t have any flashlights and that we really needed to head back.  She nodded and told her parents with her mom quickly agreeing that we all needed to head back.  Somewhat dejected the five of us started back up the road.  It was even slower going than when we were going down and soon the dark closed around us.  Luckily there was enough moon light to let us see a few dozen feet in front of us but not much else.  I kept trying to push the pace even though my wife’s mom and sister were struggling, telling them it’s just a bit further.\n\nMy wife came beside me, holding my arm and pressing against me, “please be nice, my sister is really scared.”\n\nI told her okay and apologized to her sister, saying that I’d walk more slowly for them.\n\nAt this point I was leading us, my wife still holding my arm and her sister’s hand, with her mom and dad right behind us.  A weird sensation started running through me then.  I told my wife to stay right behind me because I needed my hands to be free.  My gate lowered and widened.  Every noise from the dark caught my attention.  I didn’t move my head, only my eyes.  It didn’t matter.  Everything was dark except the faintest outline of trees and the occasional boulder.  I couldn’t see much of anything, but I had to look.\n\n“I need a knife.”\n\nMy wife made a sound which I took to be a question to my statement.\n\n“I need a knife,” almost grunting the words out, “a big fucking knife!”\n\n“Why do you need that?”  Her mom asked just above a whisper.\n\nI shook my head, barely moving it at all, “I just do.”  Every hair on my body stood on end.  That primal, animal instinct that takes hold with either fight or flight.  I was ready to fight.\n\nThe forest was quiet now, not even the sound of wind through the pines.  I remembered hearing somewhere that when a predator moves nothing else makes a sound.  All I heard was the soft crunch of gravel beneath our feet.  Not even breathing.  I’m not religious at all, in fact I’m a borderline Atheist, but at that moment I was praying to the spirit of the forest, the mountain, sky, anything that would listen that I was that predator.\n\nAfter a few hours we finally reached the main road and we relaxed.  Got into the car and drove down the mountain in silence.\n\nThe next day we went back to her parents’ house to visit.  Nothing exciting, I was watching an NFL game and having to explain everything to my wife’s mom which was fun, especially the yellow line that she didn’t know was superimposed on the broadcast and not actually on the field for the players to see.\n\nAt one point it was just my wife, her father and I sitting alone in the living room and I started talking about how weird I felt while we were walking back to the car last night.  Telling him everything.\n\n“Yeah,” he looked at the two of us, speaking in his deadpan manner, “I really wanted a big fucking gun but I didn’t want to scare your mother and sister.”\n\n“Why’s that?”\n\nHe looked at both of us, “there was something following us, some sort of predator.”  This wasn’t deadpan.  He was serious.  “I looked back a few times and saw eyes.  Big ones.”\n\nThat primal feeling took hold of me again, even inside a house during the day.\n\n“It was big too,” his gaze went into the distance as his mind replayed what ever it was he had seen.  “The first time it was on the ground, maybe fifty feet away.  Then it was up in the trees, and I mean up in the trees!”\n\nMy body shook with every beat of my heart.\n\n“The last time I saw it, it jumped from the ground into the tree tops and was keeping pace with us there.  Hunting us from above.”\n\nI kissed my wife, the first time I had ever done so in front of either of her parents, and told her I loved her more than anything.\n\nNone of us ever spoke of it again.\n\nI still go hiking, even more so since my wife passed.  But now I have two rules.\n\nI only hike during the day.\n\nI always carry a big fucking knife…",

        "text": "They say I was out for an hour.  I don't care anymore.  The construct of time is so trivial.\n\nOkay, let me explain.  A few weeks ago, I died.  Temporarily.  Sudden cardiac arrest, caused by some rare medical phenomenon.  That was the easy part.  It was over in a second.  One moment I was out on the town, wandering about, and the next, I was out.  \n\nLike many other people who have found themselves in my predicament, I saw the afterlife.  My experience started out the way they all do.  Floating above my own body, going to the light.  I was overcome with a blanketing feeling of immense love.  Then, my mother and best friend, who both tragically passed before their time, appeared to greet me.  I ran towards them, and we all embraced.  All the same old story, right?  But this is where most people wake up.  My stay was a bit longer than that.  I saw what comes next.  What *actually* happens in the afterlife.\n\nIt was just a glimpse.  A mere flicker.  But, all of a sudden, the warmth and light that surrounded me just vanished, replaced with an overwhelming feeling of weakness.  I was in the presence of a power unlike anything ever known.  As for the look of it all, it wasn't dark, but it wasn't light either.  I can't describe it.  But, my mother and my friend...their embrace turned from loving to possessive.  They grabbed my arms with hands that just felt unnatural.  I don't know how else to say it.  Then, I saw their faces.  Gone were the people I once knew.  Their features were cold, lifeless, their eye sockets filled with pools of infinite darkness.\n\nThen, they disappeared.  But their grip did not, if that makes sense.  I could now perceive the source of the immense power.  There was no mistaking it.  This was the supreme being.  And it haunts me.\n\nI can't tell you what it looked like.  It was far beyond anything a human mind could comprehend.  Nor can I put into words what it was doing.  But I knew.  I could sense the dread, the anguish, from all those in its presence.  Then, it observed me.  Again, I can't describe how.  I just knew.  All of its universal, cosmic might faced me.  I felt its greed, its hunger, its lust.  I felt its power begin to work its way over me, like tentacles, pulling me in.  \n\nAnd then, I was in the hospital.  The doctors and nurses stood in shock, my friends were smiling with relief, my family was in tears.  I had come back.  Nobody ever survives being dead this long.  They called it a miracle.\n\nAt first, I tried to deny it to myself.  That it didn't actually happen.  It was such a brief moment; surely I was mistaken.  One I could deny my experience no longer, I told myself that it was all just a dream, the ramblings of a dying mind.  That couldn't be God, or Heaven.  God is good, right?  But then I realized...says who?  We have no way of knowing that.  All the beliefs and religions from around the world that portray a kind and loving God, or even a neutral one, are all just assumptions.  Human constructs, arbitrary classifications.\n\nAnd, on top of that, my mind has forever been changed.  I would like to say \"expanded\", but that is far too happy of a term.  I can sense its foreboding presence.  I can see it without \"seeing\" it.  It exists in every corner, down every street, in every home.  I cannot go anywhere without seeing it, feeling it.  When I turn on the TV and see major disasters around the world, it is there.  When world leaders are speaking, it is behind them, calculating.  Because it wants us gone.  Its power is immeasurable, but we're catching up.  As can be seen with cases like my own.  We're playing God, and it's tired of it.  \n\nAt the top of its list, however, is me.  It knows I know the truth, and it wants me gone.  Take me back, I guess.  I've spent the past couple weeks dodging speeding cars, narrowly avoiding falling objects, killing rabid animals, and much more.  It will get me sooner or later.  I can't escape its power.  Nor can any of us.  Perhaps immortality is our only chance.  For now, though, I need to rest.  I have a headache, and I'm a little nauseous.  All this anguish must be catching up with me.  I'm going to sleep for a little while.",

        "text": "The strange tale of Marco Dagio's fate had been met with little interest from the public. His mysterious, silent disappearance from a room in the hotel Una Arteminde in one of Rome's more run-down alleys was not something reported by the media – except perhaps for a small note in the \"Il Messagero\", one of the regional outlets.\n\nI would have never known about Marco either, hadn't my travels led me to the scanty hotel room where his strange and terrifying experiences had taken their course.\n\nCuriosity had made me travel to the Holy City and, due to my major in ancient history, Rome and the Vatican lured me in with all their testimonies of times gone. And so it came to be that I walked around between old chapels and houses, only carrying my backpack, looking for traces of past times and societies and for a room to rest in after a long day of walking.\n\nI just wanted to learn as much as I could, about the city, about our past, about where we came from. It was such a miracle, the human race, evolved from apes, slowly conquering the planet, and I wanted to know all about the origins of our society.\n\nWhy had we started to build cities and what had been our first ways of life, our beliefs? What great technologies had we thought up, what customs to stabilize tribes and people? I loved those questions and had already learned a lot at university, but now also needed to see those beginnings of mankind myself. I had to walk in some of the first great cathedrals, the first great cities, here, close by. I knew that there had been others before the Romans, but I still believed that their role in history was one of the most important parts. Still, I planned on visiting other locations in the future, once I had gotten grants or scholarships. I wanted to see so many places of ancient history, Mayan ruins, Chinese temples… So much was out there. So much to be discovered!\n\nAs I am not very wealthy as a student – on the contrary – I could not rent a room in one of the more known and prestigious hotels and therefore had to venture into one of the darker parts of Rome, far away from inviting lights and jolly conversations.\n\nThe alleys I strolled through in the evening felt more contorted and battered with each step, the window shutters and wall claddings started to look more dilapidated and brittle while high walls rose up at both sides of the narrow roads. Uncomfortable bleakness was emitted by my surroundings as the houses were without ornaments and decorations. I passed one or two small chapels, wedged between big housing blocks, their steeples halfway rotten, their red brick roofs punctured with holes. Those old buildings were gated by heavy, moss-covered wooden doors and felt uninviting, almost repulsive. Everything reeked of urine and alcohol and the faint rattling of old cars and bikes enhanced this feeling of unease even more.\n\nI had left the main road behind a long time ago and was quite taken aback by the existence of such a shabby place deep within Rome's bowels. The city was renowned for its magnificence and beauty after all. The people living in these alleys were strangely foreign and defensive when spotting me. These experiences were opposite to what I had gotten to know from the folks I had met around the train station and the other city parts I had visited in the afternoon, folks who had all been jolly and kind.\n\nThese people here were different, though, and had hard and doubting looks. The women hurried away from me, and the men gazed at me with their brows furrowed before going back into their old coffee houses and taverns, almost as if they went back to their own distant worlds. When the sun had already set and cool lights shone from within the buildings, I reached a small square that finally saved me from those narrow alleys, exhausted and hungry.\n\nAn ugly pavement covered the ground, and in the middle of the old forum, I spotted a statue made from granite, seemingly looking in my direction. It was supposed to be a discus thrower, though that only became apparent when I got closer and was able to read the old sign on the ground, giving sparse information on the work of art. Time had not been kind to the statue as it was partly covered by moss and smelled disgustingly moldy. The shape of the athlete was just barely recognizable, and his face was dented in at many places and had gotten demolished by seeming acts of vandalism. The arm of the figure, raised for a throw, was missing the hand, leaving behind a sad stump.\n\nI slowly turned away from the statue, which must have been a marvel of statuary once - before becoming a crippled shade of itself through the influences of time and men. I sadly walked away from it while feeling gazes on my neck coming from the surrounding buildings.\n\nBordering on that square, I found the Una Artemide with its warmly lit windows, brown walls, and overgrown bushes next to the entrance doors. As it had gotten rather late, I quickly moved towards the building, feeling a sense of melancholy when looking at the dark contours around me.\n\nWhen I finally left the square and its depressing surroundings behind and entered the hotel's foyer, a man smelling strongly of aftershave greeted me, looking tired and somewhat grim. I hesitated a little before asking for a cheap room that I could rent for a few days, but he quickly made a good offer for Room 24, which I could move into right away.\n\nThe man told me about many people who come to this part of the city, searching for a place to stay despite the uninviting nature of the area. He advised me against talking to the locals, as they felt harassed very quickly, and he proceeded to show me some maps with more interesting places to visit during the next few days.\n\nOverall, I looked forward to exploring these areas from the Una Artemide as my base of operations, wandering the dilapidated streets of Rome to gather new knowledge and learn more about our past. The man gave me a large iron key with a bronze plate engraved with the room number and told me about the huge breakfast served every morning around 8 AM in the hotel's dining room.\n\nMy worries slowly dissipated, and I began to enjoy the old building and the thought of spending some nights there.\n\nAfter leaving the foyer and getting a hot soup from the kitchen, I ascended the old wooden staircase to the second floor. As I walked down the dimly lit corridor, the floorboards creaked beneath my feet.\n\nWhen I reached room 24 and inserted my key into the keyhole, I suddenly felt as though someone was watching me. A shiver ran down my spine, and I quickly turned around to see an eye watching me from the room opposite before the door slammed shut.\n\nConfused but determined to ignore the unsettling feeling, I entered my room. It was a small space, with torn tapestries and uninviting brown floorboards. The cold, white light from the small lamps on the ceiling only accentuated the run-down state of the place. Despite this, a large wardrobe made of dark wood provided ample space for my belongings, and I quickly changed into my sleeping attire.\n\nAs I entered the decrepit bathroom through a small green door, I couldn't help but notice the old tiles on the walls. Though the condition of the bathroom didn't bother me due to my exhaustion, I quickly brushed my teeth and prepared for sleep.\n\nDespite the less than ideal conditions, the bed was relatively comfortable, and I drifted off to sleep faster than I had expected.\n\n\\-----\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning to the noise of my phone's alarm, I was shaking and drenched in sweat. My head hurt a little and I knew that I had horrid dreams, though their content had already been locked away by my mind. I imagined that something had come and visited me during the past night, something that had opened the darkest abyss of my thoughts, but I couldn't explain those feelings, and after a short cold shower, everything was fine again.\n\nThe dining room was quite cozy – as I had to admit – and some of the other residents greeted me friendly and gave me a feeling of peace and comfort. The food was indeed plentiful and tasty, and I quickly started to feel at home.\n\nSuddenly, an old man approached, without a doubt an Italian, and after some hesitation, he sat down next to me at the table, looking at me with curiosity. I recognized his eyes as the ones that had observed me the day before from the room opposite of mine. After an initial silence, he started a conversation while his gaze wandered around fearfully. His voice was soft, but every single one of his words was soaked with panic when he addressed me:\n\n\"Please excuse my behavior. You must surely think of me as a rude person, but rest assured that I act the way I did for a good reason! My name is Silvio, and I would love to say that I am pleased to meet you, but that would be a lie. No, no, that has nothing to do with you! I am just worried, really worried! About you! I must talk to you, but not here where one could hear it. Who knows who... or what... is listening in! I beg you, let us go outside and walk to some other streets a bit more distant from here and talk. I am sorry for my secrecy, but this is a matter of life and death. Of YOUR life and death. So please come!\"\n\nI blinked in confusion and was about to tell him to bother other people, but the old man hastily added, \"I will pay for your room—if you want to keep it after our talk, that is! Now, hurry!\"\n\nI liked that offer, so it seemed logical to take him up on it, even if he was trying to scam me somehow. So, I agreed to Silvio's proposal, and after finishing the rest of our breakfast in silence, we left the hotel and quickly put some distance between us and the old building, exactly as old Silvio had suggested. We came to a busy road and spotted a bench where we could sit down.\n\n\"What did you want to tell me?\" I asked after looking at the cars around us for a while.\n\n\"First things first: Sorry again! But it's important that you leave... that room... for good! Immediately! It is not safe in there!\" Silvio started.\n\n\"Why? What could possibly happen?\" I asked.\n\n\"It... I better start from the beginning. I have been living in the hotel for some months now. It is a pretty nice place, all things considered, located in a rather uninviting area, but oh well... I had been living in the hotel because my daughter is working there as a chef, and that is why I pay less rent than one normally would. But I digress...\n\nIt started when Marco Dagio moved into room 24. I liked him. He was a rather pleasant fellow but was hell-bent on his research. He worked on something behind closed doors, some books perhaps, though I can't be sure. He did not go out very often, and there were no noises coming out of the room, so who really knows. I only met him during breakfast, and sometimes we would start talking. I did not find out much, only that he was looking for something in this area of Rome, something huge, at least that's what he told me. He was sure that something was slumbering in this area, something one could not even dream up in the wildest fantasies, but it was supposed to be real. He sounded a little mad, but his voice was trembling with the spirit of endeavor.\n\nHowever, one day, he started to leave in the mornings and stayed away until nightfall. He got more nervous, tense, almost afraid. I did not know where he went, what he was looking for, where he poked around, but he seemed both terrified and... ecstatic.\n\nThen, he stayed away during the night and did not return. I got worried but couldn't take action. The authorities around here would never look for a stranger; they just don't care. Besides, I had no idea where he went anyway and thus could not go looking for him on my own. That is why I eagerly waited for his return, but Marco was gone.\"\n\n\"And what has that got to do with me? I don't feel that there is anything terrible about that story just because he found another place to stay without telling you,\" I remarked.\n\nSilvio suddenly started shaking, and his face turned pale.\n\n\"The bad thing was not the time when he was gone. The bad thing was the time after he returned,\" Silvio's voice trembled.\n\n\"One evening, he came back dirty, sweaty, and wet, his clothes ripped to shreds, and his face white as chalk, holding his notebook. He went into his room and terrified me horrendously. That night, I don't know exactly what happened inside that room, but it must have been pure horror. At about 3 AM, I heard an icy scream - a scream I will never forget. The sound cut into my very soul and woke an ancient fear that still rages within me even now. I had someone break down the locked door, but Marco wasn't there. He was gone. The windows were all shut tightly, and there was no sign of him. The police thought I was crazy, but I know that something unspeakable happened in that room. Since that night, I am afraid to be inside the hotel, and the closer I get to room 24, the more the panic grows. Something is still there, something that is not supposed to be! You must move out of that room immediately! All the others believed me. I saved them. So let me save you as well!\" Silvio begged.\n\nI got goosebumps, but my courage had not left me. \"That is madness! That can't be. There must be a rational explanation! I will stay in that room, especially since you said you would pay for it. I listened to your story after all,\" I said defiantly.\n\nSilvio's face hardened. \"As you wish. I thought you might listen, but you are too ignorant. I will pay for your room, but you will not be there for long anyway. That's what I predict, at least!\" he said grimly and walked away.\n\nI sat there for a while, lost in thought, but finally decided to hit the road and look for some churches to visit and some knowledge to reap.\n\n\\------\n\nIt had become evening again when I returned from my explorational trip through the city back to the hotel and went to my room. I had learned so much! Many tales of old buildings and their lives. Stories about paintings and sculptures. I was content.\n\nAs I strolled through the floors, I met Silvio who tried to stop me from getting into room 24 for one last time, though his efforts did not bear any fruit; I simply ignored the old Italian and entered my chamber.\n\nIf I had known what was about to happen, I would have left on the spot, hurrying back to Germany, where my life would have been boring and normal for the rest of my days.\n\nBut I stayed.\n\nThe lights flickered ominously and unsettled me, a menace, threatening me, though that had to be just because of my vivid imagination. I entered the bathroom, ready to brush my teeth.\n\nWhen I looked into the mirror I froze. For a short moment I believed to see a tall, distorted shade standing in the room far behind me. My throat started hurting, even though everything was normal again after some blinking. The illusion had left behind a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nBreathing calmly, I leaned against the wall where my hand brushed against one of the loose tiles. I stopped and realized that it could be taken out. I uncovered a small opening, letting a horrible stench into the room. What could rest inside? A rotten hand? The cadaver of a rat? Why hadn't I noticed the stench before? I got my smartphone from the main room whilst looking for the shade, though I could spot nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nOf course not.\n\nGripped by anxiety, I shone the phone's light into the gaping black hole in the wall and finally spotted a leathery object resting deep down inside the niche. When I pulled the rugged thing with some disgust out of its hiding place, I recognized it as an old notebook or diary. The pages were yellowed and old, at the end some were missing, and scrawly cursive English writing covered most of them.\n\nThe cover told me that this was the research journal of Marco Dagio. Despite the stench and against all reason I decided to read the hideous thing. To uncover what really had happened.\n\nI just had to know! It couldn't be that the man had just vanished from his room! Where should he have gone to, after all? Also, Silvio had said that Marco had looked for something incredible. Dangerous, but incredible.\n\nI just had to know! What if I discovered something worthwhile? Something amazing? Surely, it would not be… too dangerous. Surely, there was a rational explanation for all of this!\n\nHolding on to these thoughts, I took the book and laid down on the bed. Full of excitement, I started reading.\n\nAs I turned the pages, the words of the diary began to reveal an obsession with the occult and the supernatural. Marco wrote about his search for a mysterious document, which he believed was hidden somewhere within the city. He described in detail the strange occurrences and inexplicable phenomena that he had read about during his search. The more I read, the more I felt a sense of unease creeping over me…\n\n*May 4, 2013:*\n\n*During my research, I discovered some interesting documents in the Vatican's archives, originating in the 14th century. They are about an object of Satan, being brought to the West by a traveler from the East, probably China, Korea or Japan. It appears to be a black hand mirror which is surrounded by horrifying happenings that drove the traveler's family mad. That, in turn, led to the inquisition burning them at the stake as witches. The uncanny thing catching my eye is the fact that the story is almost identical to one from a German psychiatrist.*\n\n*The man had vanished from his room one night, though he still managed to send his notes to a newspaper. It is perhaps only a coincidence that similar reports have surfaced over the years, mostly unknown and quickly locked away by certain institutions like the Catholic Church or the Society of Eb. Thanks to my profession and my previous work, I was finally able to look for more documents in the Vatican's archives that might imply events of unknown cause. Unfortunately, I was never able to find someone who could tell me stories of true substance about all those happenings I had found hints to during the past years. Obviously, one should be careful when hypothesizing just based on some written documents, but I am certain of the validity of my thoughts.*\n\n*May 17, 2013:*\n\n*After having done a bit more research, I got news of a man who met some unspeakable things in Eastern Europe; a man who only hesitatingly gave away his information. He seems to be shaken to the core if my source is to be believed. Tomorrow, I will hurry to Vienna, meeting said man, and perhaps I will get some more information on all the puzzling events. Then, my theories will finally be confirmed. I am looking forward to tomorrow.*\n\n*May 18, 2013:*\n\n*There has been a major setback. My interview with the man from Vienna has not taken place as he has disappeared from his room during the last night. A friend of his who is connected to his story is nowhere to be found either. I was too late! I have to find another clue, one that will not lead to nothingness in such a disastrous manner. Nonetheless, I will not be disheartened by this turn of events and carry on my research. Perhaps there will be more to find in the archives. I just have to keep digging!*\n\n*June 18, 2013:*\n\n*Finally, another clue! I discovered the testaments of an old secret cult that existed back in ancient times. Its history was locked away deep within the Vatican's archives, and I had to move heaven and earth to get a permit for entering those areas. But luckily, some money and some friends made it possible, and so I might learn more important things very soon. Then, my work will finally bear fruit!*\n\n*24th June 2013*\n\n*I can't believe what is starting to surface... The whole matter is far greater than I ever could have imagined, so much greater! They have been the ones; they hid it away. The greatest knowledge of mankind, the power to move mountains and climb the moon! Unfathomable knowledge! It is still here, here in Rome. The entrance is at the \"Riserva Naturale della Marcigliana\"! It's so close, only minutes by car. I can't believe it! I have to go and find it, beneath the trees, at the three stones, guarded by Pluto. It's clever, but obvious if one knows. If one knows! The truth, the old secret! And then, I will have made it! I will be famous, a hero, the ultimate scientist!*\n\nThere was another last entry, undated, and its contents made me gasp out loud. It was scribbled down more hastily, and by reading it, I got the feeling of looking at the writings of a lunatic. The last sentences in the diary were simply a single, terrifying statement:\n\n*\"It's too late. They're coming for me.\"*\n\nWhat had he found below Roman streets? A secret, without a doubt, but which one?\n\nWhat ancient knowledge lay beneath my feet?\n\nI had to know; I just had to! I knew how he had felt. What he had craved. The bliss of new truths. The happiness of discovery.\n\nQuickly, I got up and packed my belongings into my backpack. A strange eagerness had gripped me, as though preparing me for a long walk. My thoughts were racing, and I was sweating like mad due to the excitement.\n\nI ran to the door, ready to open it, when my smartphone started vibrating. I looked at the display and stopped. The screen had gotten strangely distorted, and white noise covered all of it, almost like the one on old television sets. I looked at my wristwatch, almost by accident.\n\nIt was 3 AM.\n\nSuddenly, I remembered the words old Silvio had muttered in the morning; an icy shiver ran down my spine.\n\n*\"Marco disappeared around 3 AM...\"*\n\nThe lights in the room started flickering, and my blood seemed to freeze in my veins. A dangerous doom was approaching; I could feel it! I had to leave; I had to...\n\nI kicked open the door and jumped out, clinging to the luggage I had carried with me, when the lights inside the chamber died off for good.\n\nI stared into the darkness, listening. There was only silence. It had just been the lights...\n\nI almost fainted when I realized that the room was not empty, that someone or something was there. Staring back at me.\n\nI could not see what it was. I pressed my back against Silvio's door and looked into the blackness, looked at... it.\n\nMy senses started to fade when I saw a skinny, inhuman hand, white as milk, with coarse skin and six fingers, reach for me, emerging from the darkness of the room.\n\nAnd then I heard its gurgling, clicking voice:\n\n*\"Ebrugh... Ebrugh... You will all cease... I think... I think, you might be able to see it now... Eslud esmad... The Ancient Age... just vermin, cattle... Kage no hitobito, Fuka-sa...\"*\n\nWhen I came to my senses, I was standing next to a bench in a park, my belongings in one hand, Marco's journal in the other. I did not know how I had gotten there, whether I had run screaming through the streets of Rome or crawled like a beaten dog. My thoughts were spinning, and in the end, I threw up on the ground, my head filled with panic and terror. I felt watched, hunted.\n\nI had to find out what was going on; this couldn't be happening! And now I was certain...there was something unnatural below me. I should have left the country, but my mind was taken over by the urge to know, to learn. I started walking; I would look for what Marco had already found. I would learn the secrets!",

        "text": "It was supposed to be a peaceful holiday. A week in a small village in County Wicklow, the birthplace of my wife Alice’s great grandfather. It was unforgettable, but not in the way I had hoped. The bloodshed, the murders of that first night, I will never forget.\n\nWe arrived at our inn late in the afternoon, our flight from Stansted having been delayed over five hours. After dropping off our bags, we explored the quaint village. It was charming in a way. No Tesco, but a variety of shops where we stopped to assemble our dinner. Two loaves of fresh bread and an apple cake from the baker, a block of Irish cheddar from the cheese monger, and black and white pudding, along with smoked ham, from the butcher. We also picked up a bottle of Irish red. I didn’t even know Ireland produced wine and was sceptical that it would be drinkable, but Alice insisted. She wanted to have a true Irish experience. \n\nOur dinner assembled, we walked a few miles south of town to what our guidebook described as “perhaps the prettiest little church in Ireland.” Was a little let down, just a small, nondescript grey-stoned edifice set on top of a hill, surrounded by a tall iron fence. Pretty yes, but not spectacular, nothing you couldn’t find in any village back in England. \n\n“Look at that funny fellow,” Alice said loudly, pointing to a haggard man sleeping next to a crooked tombstone. “He looks like an overgrown leprechaun.”\n\n“Shhh,” I said, “don’t want to wake him.” As we made our way to the other side of the church, I looked back, making sure the man, who did look something like a leprechaun, with his red beard, green top hat, and ratty tweed suit, was still sleeping. Thankfully he was.   \n\nWe laid our blanket on the grass and unpacked our picnic. Spread apple chutney on the thick bread, before layering on slices of cheddar and ham. Truly delicious. Can’t say the same for the wine. Drinkable, but nothing like the wine back in my homeland of Greece. Tired from the traveling, we soon fell asleep.\n\nI awoke in the dark to a distant scream, a haunting, shrill shriek. Looking ghostly in the full moon, the haggard man approached us, swaying like a drunkard.\n\n“That was the cry of a banshee,” he yelled. “Death is nigh, nigh! This very night. It will come. It will come to this churchyard.”\n\nBefore I could respond he ran off, jumping over the iron fence that encircled the churchyard. \n\n“Probably just an owl our something,” I told Alice, who looked petrified. “Let’s head back though, it’s getting late.” \n\nWe quickly packed up our things and made our way to the gate. Locked. Chained and bolted. The fence was over four feet tall. No way my wife would be getting over that. I looked around and noticed two cars parked outside the gate, cars that weren’t there before. \n\n“Must be someone in the church,” I said. “Let’s try the front door.” \n\nIt was locked. I knocked several times. No answer. We made away around the church.  On its right side was a small wooden door. Alice tried it. To my surprise, it opened. \n\nI followed her inside. A narrow stone staircase led downwards, dimly lit by ensconced candles.\n\n“Probably leads down to the catacombs,” I said.  Alice, who had already started down the stairs, wasn’t listening.\n\nI chased after her. Must have been five flights until we reached the stone bottom. There was a small door, no more than four feet high, to our right, and a narrow tunnel to our left, from which I could hear chanting in Latin. As my eyes adjusted to the dim light, I realized the tunnel was made from skulls and bones. \n\n“Reminds me of that place in Italy,” Alice said.\n\nIt did not remind me of the Capuchin Crypt in Rome, but someplace else, someplace evil from my childhood in Greece. But before I could voice my concerns, Alice had already started through the tunnel. I followed her, having to stoop to avoid hitting my head. \n\nAfter twenty feet, the tunnel bent to the right. Around the bend, I saw four men, about thirty feet away, standing in a circular chamber, dressed in black robes, chanting around a stone coffin.\n\n“Hello!” my wife shouted. “Can you unlock the front gate please.” One of hooded figures turned and stared menacingly at us, his face skeletal.\n\nWe ran back through the tunnel and dashed up the steps, hearing footsteps behind. At the top, I pounded on the door, but it was locked. Slowly, the footsteps advanced up the stairs. I tried to force the door open with my shoulder, but it wouldn’t budge. \n\nA figure finally appeared a few minutes later. A robed man, making his way up the stairs with the help of a cane. An old man, but not the skeletal face of before. \n\n“Should I throw my shoe at him?” asked Alice. \n\n“No need for that,” said the surprisingly jolly voice.  “There’s no need to fear me, just an old parish priest. Father Jack you can call me.”\n\nI relaxed, embarrassed at how silly I acted. “Sorry father,” I said. “It’s been a long day and we’re tired.”\n\n“That’s quite alright. Where are you two visiting from, can’t quite place your accent.” \n\n“From London, although I grew up in Greece. I’m Giorgios, and this is my wife Alice.”\n\n“Lovely town, London. What brings you here? Don’t get too many visitors here.”\n\n“My wife’s idea. She wanted to learn more about her family. Her great grandfather, her mum’s maternal grandfather, was born here in the late 1800’s before he moved to Liverpool”\n\n“Lovely, what was her name, dear?”\n\n“Patrick McNamara,” Alice said. “Never met him, died the year before I was born.”\n\n“McNamara! My mum was a McNamara. Lots of Paddys too in my family tree. We're probably related. Although everyone from a place this small basically is. Even that man who gave you a wee fright, Monsignor Michan, is a second cousin. On my mum’s side. Fifth cousin on my dad’s,” he said with a chuckle. “Why don’t you come down with me. I promise we’re not summoning the devil.” \n\n“That sounds lovely,” my wife said before I could object.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe followed Father Jack down the stairs and through the tunnel of bones. Around the large open coffin were three men, two young priests standing close together and the ancient skeletal one standing across from them. I peered into the coffin. To my surprise, the body was mummified, dressed in armour, and well over 7-feet tall. A sword, still sharp after all these years, lay beside him.  Above the giant’s head, a narrow shaft had been bored into the limestone ceiling, through which a few stars were visible. \n\n“Surprised to find a mummy, here?” Father Jack asked. “So was I when I first got here, read that the limestone walls help preserve the body. Now for introductions. You’ve already been acquainted with Monsignor Michan. The two young lads are Fathers Mike and Stanislaw. Father Stanislaw is from Poland, sadly Ireland does not produce the great number of priests it did in the days of yore, so many come from abroad. You can him Father Stan. You’re probably wondering what we’re doing here. We’re on a pilgrimage to the resting place of St. Finbar the Giant. He led the resistance against the Vikings in the 9th century. Legend has it that he was so strong that he once decapitated five Norsemen with a single swing of his mighty longsword. He’s been forgotten mainly, like many of the saints of the first millennium. Early Christian Ireland produced dozens of saints, so many that Erin was once known as the land of saints and scholars. And I think it is important to pay homage to them, to honor them, to make offerings to them. Grab these two!”\n\nI turned to run when I heard Father Jack laughing. “Sorry mate, I couldn’t help myself. We’re not going to sacrifice you, the Church doesn’t do that. Although I’m sure there were lots of sacrifices down here; before St. Paddy converted the island, this was an ancient Druid site. It—”\n\n“Glad to know that you think this is a funny matter,” interrupted Monsignor Michan, the skeletal priest. “So tell me, why did you bring these intruders down here?”\n\n“They’re curious, the young miss’s family is from here originally, McNamara is the name.”\n\n“I don’t care where she’s from,” said the monsignor. “Look at her, wearing trousers like a man, an abomination. Bet she’s not Catholic.”\n\n“I’m Anglican actually,” Alice said. “Although I don’t go to church very often, to be honest. My mum was Catholic, converted when she married though.”\n\n“Utterly null and void,” screamed the monsignor. \n\n“What is, love?” Alice asked. \n\n“Your faith, if you can call it that. And you,” he said, pointing a bony finger at me. “What are you?”\n\n“Greek Orthodox, sort of. I was raised Pagan. Grew up worshiping Zeus.” \n\n“They use to burn people like you,” he screamed. “If we were a proper—“\n\n“Michan please, he was joking,” said Father Jack. “Please, try to relax.” \n\n“I won’t relax. They’re schismatic heretics, the lot of them.” \n\n“Please forgive him,” Father Jack said. “He was a young lad during the Great Schism of 1054. A tender subject for him.”\n\nI looked at the scowling face of Monsignor Michan. I needed to get myself, and my wife, out of here.  “Father Jack, we’re a little tired from our flight and would like to get back home. We’d love to get together for tea or a drink in the village though. Can you please send one of the two younger lads up with a key, we don’t want to make you do those—“\n\nAs I was speaking, a ray of moonlight entered the shaft and struck the mummified head of St. Finbar. He rose from his sarcophagus, sword in hand, and swung it at Father Jack, decapitating him. Fathers Mike and Stan headed towards the tunnel. I grabbed Alice and ran after them. \n\nWe were about thirty feet up the stairs when the walls started crumbling. A large stone hit Father Stan on the head, sending him plummeting to the stone floor below. \n\n“This way you eejits,” Monsignor Michan shouted from below, pointing to the small door I had seen earlier. “The stairwell is going to collapse, this way leads out.” \n\nAlice and I ran back down the stairs, Father Mike following behind. I looked at the tunnel, which had completely caved in. Hopefully that would trap Finbar, at least for a little while. \n\nAs the stones kept falling, Alice and I followed Michan through the door.  I wondered how an old man like him had managed to escape. I didn’t hear any footsteps behind me when I was running through the bone tunnel. A few seconds later, Father Mike came through, weeping, carrying the body of Father Stan. Michan slammed the door shut.\n\nI looked around. We were in another tunnel, about five feet in height and three feet in width, its walls carved from limestone. A few ensconced candles, spaced about 100 feet apart, gave off a faint light. \n\nI looked at Father Mike, who was bent over the body of Stan, weeping, holding a crucifix and praying over the priest’s lifeless body. \n\n“Get away from him you bloody sod,” Monsignor Michan yelled. “He’s dead, he’s in Hell, there’s nothing you can do.”\n\nFather Mike kept crying. Michan slapped him. \n\n“Father, please,” Alice said. “There was no reason to slap him,”\n\n“Address me as monsignor, you filthy whore,” Michan hissed. \n\n“That’s enough,” I said. “Let’s go and leave this miserable old bastard behind.”\n\nMichan laughed. “How do you think you’re going to find your way out, Greek? The labyrinth of Daedalus is mere diversion compared to the maze you’re in.”\n\nI didn’t believe him, but didn’t want to risk it. “Fine, show us out.”\n\nMichan grinned and pulled out a metallic torch from his robe. “Follow me, lads.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe walked for about thirty minutes. The tunnel curved, but never branched. After we came around one bend, I could see a spot of light in the distance. \n\n“Bastard lied to us,” Alice said. “There were no maze.”\n\nMichan laughed and ran ahead, pressing something on the wall. A metal grate descended from the ceiling, blocking our escape. Five feet behind us, another grate fell. We were trapped.\n\n“I woke up today thinking that I would send three heretics to the pits of hell today,” the murderous monsignor hissed. “Looks like there will be five dining at the Devil’s table tonight.”\n\n“You are not a man of God,” Father Mike said.\n\n“To the contrary, I am his faithful servant, carrying out his orders. Greek, let me ask you a question. Who is the Hound of Hades that guards the gates of the underworld?”\n\nI didn’t respond. \n\n“You must be aware of Cerberus. Tonight, you will meet one of his kin.” \n\nI watched in desperation as the mad monsignor danced a little jig before heading off towards the light. \n\nWe tried to lift the grates, but they wouldn’t budge. We checked our mobile phones. As we expected, no service. I looked at the wall, trying to find the switch that Michan pressed to trap us. In the dim light, I thought I could see a protrusion from the wall, about fifteen feet away. I took off my shoes, stuck them through the 6-inch square openings in the grate, and threw them at the switch. No luck. The others tried with the same result.\n\n“Does anyone know you’re here,” I asked Father Mike.\n\n“Miss Doyle, the housekeeper,” he said, his voice trembling. “She’s probably gone off to bed, won’t notice we haven’t returned till the morn.\"\n\n“Nothing to do but wait, I guess,” I said. I lay down on the hard ground. For the first time, I noticed that there were symbols etched into the ceiling. I had seen some of them before, on an amulet that my father gave to me back in Greece, an amulet that likely saved me from a gruesome fate. After immigrating to the UK, I had taken it to an expert at the British Museum in London. She told me that it contained symbols from the Linear B script, along with some from the undeciphered Linear A and Cretan hieroglyphic alphabets. In addition, there were symbols that she had never seen before. In her opinion it was a forgery, made in the 19th century when the market for classical antiquities was hot. But I knew that was rubbish.\n\n“Father Mike,” I said, “do you know about those symbols on the ceiling?” \n\nHe shook his head. “I’ve never been in here before. Heard this tunnel is over 5,000 years old though. The ancient Celts had a fortified town on the hilltop, with this serving as a secret escape route in the event of a siege.” \n\nWe lay in silence for what seemed like hours. Eventually, I dozed off.\n\nI awoke to screaming. Heading towards us, from the direction of the distant light, was a monstrous creature, resembling a three-headed vulture. Its long, thick tail was protected by dark green scales, like those of a crocodile’s. Its body and snake-like necks were covered with drab grey feathers, but its bald heads were as colorful as those of tropical parrots, their skin ranging in colour from lavendar to sea green. Bright fleshly orange caruncles hung from its sharp blood-red beaks. \n\nIt made its way slowly towards where we were trapped, its heads sniffing the ground like a pack of bloodhounds.  \n\n“Ellen Trechend,” whispered Father Mike. \n\n“Who’s that, love?” asked Alice. “Is Ellen your mum?”\n\n“It is that monster. My grandmother told me stories of him growing up.”\n\n“Did she tell you how to kill him?” I asked. \n\nHe shook his head. \n\n“Can you raise your crucifix to it?” I asked him, remembering how I repelled a lamia, a child-eating monster, when I was a child in Greece. \n\n“I will try, but I do no not think it will be effective. I did not decide to become a priest because of my faith.” \n\n“Don’t think it will work either love,” Alice said. “That’s only for vampires. Met one in Brighton in ’87. Beastly thing.”\n\nAs the monstrous chimera continued to approach, we backed ourselves against the far grate. The creature stopped at the first grate briefly, before sticking its necks through its narrow openings.  Thankfully, their beaks couldn’t quite reach us. \n\nFather Mike raised his crucifix a few inches away from one of its heads, and recited some lines in Latin. The monster opened its beak and shot out a long, yellow forked tongue. As Father Mike continued to pray, it licked his hand.\n\n“Rough as feckin’ sandpaper,” he screamed, dropping the crucifix. I picked it up and tried a Greek  prayer I was taught as a child. No effect. The monster kept flicking its tongue a few inches from my head. \n\nAs I deliberated my next move, I heard heavy footsteps from behind. I turned my head, and saw Finbar come around the bend, sword in hand. Couldn’t be more than twenty feet away from us. In desperation, I raised the crucifix and jabbed it at one of the creature’s eyes. It shrieked and started thrashing. Its armored tail hit the switch, causing the grates to rise swiftly. \n\n“Run,” I shouted. I grabbed Alice and we dove under the grate as the monster struggled to extricate its heads, Father Mike close behind us. We ran towards the light. About halfway there, I heard the creature shriek again. I looked back and saw that although Finbar had lost an arm, he had managed to slay the creature, whose heads now lay at his feet. He stopped for a second to look at his handiwork, before resuming his steady march towards us. \n\nWe sprinted to the exit, where there was a small opening in a pile of boulders, barely big enough for someone to fit through. I looked back. Finbar was about 50 feet away, advancing steadily. \n\n“You first,” I told Alice. She nimbly slid her small frame through the opening. \n\n“You next,” Father Mike said. I looked back at Finbar, who was now only thirty feet away. With difficulty, I managed to squeeze through the opening, landing in the mud next to Alice. We were by a stream, the sun rising. I looked back at the opening and saw Father Mike’s head and torso emerge from the hole. He never had time to scream. His upper body landed next to us, cleanly severed at his waist. \n\nFinbar’s leathery face emerged from the hole. Even though his eye sockets were empty, he seemed to stare at us. Suddenly, as the rays of the rising sun struck his head, he turned to dust. \n\nAs Alice and I embraced, I heard whistling from behind me. I turned and saw the haggard man from the churchyard walking towards us. \n\n“For you are dust, and to dust you shall return,” he sang merrily as he passed us.",

        "text": "So I'll try to keep this short, because it's quite the crazy story by itself and I don't think it needs much of an introduction. I'm from Greece and for the past month I've been vacationing to the American Midwest, a dream come true for me and my girlfriend after many years of planning it. Now yeah, I know what you're thinking, who tf dreams of traveling to the Midwest, well, we did. All those cute little cities and the emptyness, the sheer *nature* of all of it...we loved it! And all the stories you could find there.\n\nAnyway, for the last week of our trip we decided to take Route 306 in Nevada, going through the Crescent Valley and disappearing inside the smallest roads we could find in search of the tiniest possible community of the most remote rednecks ever. We'd evidently gone a bit mad after a month of Midwest craziness, because I still can't rationalize why exactly we wanted to do that; point is we wanted to and we did anyway.\n\nWe took 306 from the junction with the Eisenhower highway shortly after Primeuax and after driving for what seemed like forever we eventually took a much smaller road leading further North. I'm not sure where that road was but I remember a huge ranch-like community with lots of beautiful houses on the side of the street just before the turn, and driving by a beautiful river for a while before we left it behind us to head North. It was a beautiful morning so we just kept driving for hours and hours, until by our calculations we should've hit Eisenhower again; we never did. At some point by noon we realized that we were probably lost. The road itself was very badly kept, the asphalt cracked in multiple points and seeming like it hadn't been used in forever. That couldn't have been the case though because we could see a continuous line of old wooden electricity poles running the entire length of the road, without fault.\n\nAnyway, I'm trailing. Point is we eventually arrived at a tiny community, exactly the thing we were looking for in first place. Arrived is a bad word; we actually literally popped inside the place. One moment we were driving in an empty desert and another we were by the houses, locals eyeing us with what seemed like curiosity. We were both excited to have finally discovered an untouched piece of American weirdness, and quickly parked the car somewhere behind a warehouse and went outside to find a DINNER!\n\nIn hindsight we should've probably payed more attention to the people's expressions, because they were not curious; they were afraid. Immediately after we entered the beautiful dinner the waitress approached us and asked us, verbatim, to leave. We were very surprised because we'd heard so much about the fabled American welcoming and were so eager to get it directly from its untapped source, but she was so insistent that we get out that we eventually did. We never learned what the fuss was about; same thing happened in a tiny cafe where a bunch of elders were drinking their tea or whatever as well as in the lobby of the small two story hotel where we entered to inquire for another establishment. Everyone seemed so passionate in their pleads and orders to get us to leave, that we couldn't even protest. Wtf could we have said? And wtf where these people thinking?\n\nAnyway, after we got over the xenophobia, which, we agreed among ourselves was to be expected in such a place, we decided to grab some beers from the car and explore the town. Bad idea, because people kept appearing wherever we went and persistently eyeing us to the point where they were literally standing in the middle of the street to stare at us like they'd never seen outsiders before. I mean who tf installed the electricity poles then?\n\nEventually we made our way to a more modern looking place in the outskirts of the town, a mix between a bar, a convenience store and a community center. The people inside were mostly young, student-aged, and didn't stare as persistently as their elders. A couple came to our table to sell us some paintings or whatever, but we quickly brushed them away. Some kept coming back, and we tried to give them some money but they refused it; instead they shoved the paintings in our laps insisting we look at them and took off running. The paintings were weirdly detailed, depicting some sort of mummy-zombie hybrid roaming the streets of their city, but one thing you learn in Greece is that anyone who gives something away for free doesn't do this for a good reason, so we politely left them on the next table.\n\nAs we were relaxing, finally feeling refreshed after our walk in the sun's scorching heat we got our first example of  fabled American police brutality. The city sheriff, or someone cosplaying as such came over to our table and loudly proclaimed that we were disturbing the peace. When my girlfriend dared to ask why he thought so, the guy -a middle aged fatso- pulled out a moderate sized handgun and held it by his hip; we decided not to push it any further and after paying for our beverages we left the shop, the sheriff in tail. He still seemed to be bothered by our presence, as did a number of townsfolk who had gathered around the cafe looking displeased. By this point we understood that this was more than being unnerved with some strangers. These people actively hated us.\n\nI made a point of explaining we didn't want to disturb anyone and we were merely visiting, and some elders made some weird remarks about the street and how we shouldn't have been able to cross it; in response I congratulated them on the quality of the local network and said it wasn't such a big deal, I've seen worse. This seemed to somehow offend him, and for some reason scared to sheriff who seemed to be very unhappy with the thought of his city being more connected to the outside world. The small gathering eventually turned into a community forum, where younger people kept asking the elders for change; pocket or political we couldn't determine, so we excused ourselves and slowly made our way out.\n\nBy the time we had reached the car, it was already half dark, and the city looked much less inviting than in the morning. A local creep had slashed our tire and drawn crude graffiti around our car; thankfully I had a spare tire in the locked trunk and could replace the slashed tire fairly quickly. By that time though it was fully dark and I decided that driving back right now would be a bad idea. Thankfully, my gf remembered the hotel we had encountered earlier and we went to spend the night there, to the clerk's horror.\n\nNow is where things got actually weird. The clerk said he didn't want us to pay for the room, but we had to let him lock us inside for the whole night. He offered to give us spare keys in case we felt threatened by the idea, but insisted we stay inside at all costs. This was obviously not going to happen, but we decided against bothering the sheriff again. Instead we hard pressed the clerk to either accept our money or at least tell us why we had to stay inside. Eventually the hotel owner came from the back office and reluctantly explained that the hotel experienced technical difficulties with its gas heater system; the whole town was falling apart, he said, and they didn't really want people to find out since it would mean an intervention from the government and the hotel being either forcefully renovated at his expense or, worse, closed. The heater leaked gas every night when the temperature dropped, but they had insulated the room doors against it so we would be safe; even he had to stay in a hotel room instead of his private suite at night, he joked. This explanation made sense, so we agreed to not leave our room at all during the night and went upstairs to check it out.\n\nNo complaints here, it was actually pretty beautiful. The next weird thing happened during the night, when something woke me and my gf up  while we were sleeping. It was 3:23am, not a very good time for visits, but the goddamn clerk kept banging at our door. And I'm talking BANGING, like full on pounding that wood like he wanted to break it down. Ngl I was kinda scared, but more pissed since he could've messed up the hermetic seal and let the gas inside the room. I asked him to stop, but he kept mumbling and groaning, so eventually I assumed he must've been sleepwalking. If he was outside, it meant that the gas leak was probably contained for the moment, so with that thought I opened the door to ask him to stop again.\n\nWell it seems like the clerk was even weirder than I thought because he had dressed up like the thing from the kids' paintings. He looked like he was rotting from the inside out, his skin was greyish and \"growing mold\" and his eyes were bloodshot and lacking pupils; the thought of him applying so much makeup just to fool two tourists was hilarious and I started laughing. Obviously he didn't appreciate the joke and he lunged forward, trying to enter the room to fight me. I just shut the door on his face and returned to bed. We just wore our trip rated earmuffs and slept through his pounding.\n\nThe next day when we went back downstairs to pay the hotel lobby was heavily damaged and the owner and clerk were nowhere to be found. Not willing to just comb through the city to find two dudes, we left the money with the surprisingly upbeat sheriff and went back to our car. The return trip was uneventful and we returned to Vegas, from where we grabbed our flight back to Athens, concluding our trip.\n\nSo yeah, this is my weird American midwest story, I guess it makes sense that yall trapped in the middle of nowhere would be so unused to strangers that you either prank or fear them; no in between. To the clerk on the unnamed city: I still owe you for the best costume I've ever seen, I just wish you hadn't bitten me, man.",

        "text": "5 years ago I lived on the outskirts of a fairly crowded city, right next to the train station, where I did night shifts as a security guard. \n\nAlthough it was right on the edge of a city, the area was surprisingly quiet, the streets being roamed only by drunks walking slowly, not looking for trouble, but whatever they did they ended up finding it. \n\nIn the last year that I lived there, some rather strange things happened, which greatly contributed to my decision to leave, not just a job that paid better. \n\nTrains had to pass through the station every 2 hours, it was a relatively small station, with only 4 lines. At night, when I was working there I was alone, the cashiers being long gone without caring about the people who wanted to get on a train to sell them a ticket if they didn't already have one. \n\nOne evening while I was doing my usual route, everything was quieter than usual so I thought I'd take this opportunity to explore the old train station, which was about a 10-minute walk from where I was staying. \n\nIt had been closed after the Second World War when, due to the bombings, it was no longer restored and it was decided to build a new one closer to the city. \n\nIn the end I got there. The air felt musty, with a predominating smell of swamp. They were old wagons that were destroyed by time and rust. On the main building there still was the old clock that surprisingly survived the bombings, it was among the only things intact. The few walls left standing were hidden by ivy. \n\nSuddenly there was a bang, like a gong and the clock started working again, my blood froze in my veins. I started to walk slowly backwards when I tripped over one of the rails and hit my head on a wagon. \n\nI could feel my hair starting to get wet from the blood, but I couldn't move, nor did I feel the pain from the blow. \n\nJust then, smoke started coming out of a locomotive. And to see an orange light on the window. I finally managed to stand up and slowly started to walk towards her. There was fire in the place where the coal was put to run the locomotive. I pulled hard on the door a few times and finally it opened with a loud creak. \n\nThere was no one there, but the door closed behind me. The fire had begun to heat up as soon as I came in and it started coming out of the furnace, just then the clock had struck midnight. I pushed the door in panic, but it didn't budge. \n\nA smiling face was starting to be drawn on the dirty front window, there was no one outside, I would have seen the finger on the window making the drawing. \n\nI broke the window with the back of the flashlight I had in my hand and managed to get out. I had some burns on my skin and scratches from the shards, but I still didn't feel anything. I guess that's why I didn't leave there sooner. Adreline had already risen to my brain. \n\nI decided to climb the clock tower. The entrance door was gone and there were fallen planks on the floor. The ladder although it had rust, still seemed stable. I started to climb when suddenly an iron bar gave way and I fell. \n\nA plank had pierced my chest. I knew I was going to die. \n\nThen I opened my eyes. I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it was just a dream, when I realized I was in the same locomotive, but it wasn't destroyed, there were even wagons behind. \n\nThere was a working train running, just me there. I felt my chest and realized that I had a scar. I started going through the compartments, I don't know if I wanted to find someone there or not, but when I got to the last one there was a woman there. \n\nShe was young, although she had white hair. I had never seen her before in my life. I asked her: \n\n\"Who are you? Where are we?\" \n\nShe didn't answer any of my questions, he just kept staring blankly at me. I looked out the window, but there was nothing outside, just fog. You couldn't even see the rails. \n\nSuddenly, she stood up and came towards me. She was kissing me, but at the same time he was stabbing me in the stomach with a knife. I couldn't do anything, I didn't want to do anything. I had passed out. \n\nWhen I woke up later I was in the clock tower. \n\n\"Midnight marks the end,\" she told me. \"Yours has come too.\" \n\nShe said this in a voice that had a note of sadness in it, but it was a pure voice. I realized I couldn't move, not because I didn't want to, I just couldn't, something was holding me in place. I could only look at her. \n\n\"You asked me earlier who I am. I am known as many things. Some call me a spirit, some an evil fairy, and some a miracle worker, depending on how I interacted with that person. \n\nA long time ago, when I was on the train we met earlier, something happened, there was a loud sound and everything started to catch fire. I saw and heard everyone die. That happened to me too, but here I am talking with you.\" \n\nI didn't know what to say to her, but I didn't belive her, she looked so real. \n\n\"It doesn't matter if you believe me or not, you're going to die now anyway, it's inevitable, I have to do this to survive. Me or you, I'll choose myself.\" \n\nI understood then that she was telling the truth, she was speaking with complete certainty and the note of sadness had disappeared, now it was just indifference, she didn't care about others, she was able to do that whenever she needed. I saw her pull out a knife from behind. \n\nI wasn't afraid, I was just thinking how to escape. I was starting to be able to move, I couldn't stand up to use my arms, but I could bend over. I leaned back and broke the glass of the clock tower and started falling over. \n\nI woke up in the train again, but this time I knew what was going to happen. I could hear her calm steps sure on the floor of the carriages coming towards me. \n\nI started hitting the window with the flashlight, but it didn't break. Then I took the gun out of the holster. If she was a ghost there was no point in shooting at her. I fired all the bullets into the window until it broke. Then I jumped into the fog outside. \n\nI heard her scream. \n\nI opened my eyes and I was at the entrance to the abandoned train station. I didn't go in this time.",

        "text": "Hey guys. Feel free to scroll down for the ritual itself, if you'd like, but read through if you want some context as to why *I'd* like to try it. So basically...\n\nJosie, my wife, decided that we need to separate. This came as no surprise, but it hurt as much either way. If you’d ask why, I’d counter with how much time you’ve got. Our estrangement has been a long and cold process, with fault residing on both parties.  We’ve been together for twelve years, married for eight, living together for seven. Although she broke the news of the separation *solo*, the pragmatics we’ve dealt with as a *couple*; I’ll move out, she’ll stay at the apartment. \n\nWe’re not hostile towards each other, so there’s been no real need to hurry. It took me about a month to find a place - with her help - but I still have a few weeks until I can move in. It has been… bittersweet. Working together to find a new apartment, sorting through belongings - we’ve really worked together for the first time in a long time, and that has felt… *nice*. The apartment has felt warm again. Anyway, I’ve been slowly packing up my stuff so there’s a bit less stress on moving day (who am I kidding, it’s still the worst shit ever), and as I was picking out my books (few and far between) between her books (plentiful and varied) on our large, shared Billy-shelf, I came across one I hadn’t seen in a long time.\n\nThe book in question was my grandmother’s old grimoire. She died when I was eleven or twelve, so I never got to know her well. I snagged the book for myself as I was helping my parents sort through her stuff after her death. She owned hundreds of books, and I don’t think my parents gave more than a vacant nod when I asked them if I could have it - if they had, I doubt they’d have let their christian son own a bona fide grimoire. \n\nI think I’d only ever flipped through it once or twice, mostly letting it decorate any bookshelf I’d had during my life. When I was a kid, it was in my room, standing between Percy Jackon novels on a small, never dusted, one foot long shelf above my bed. Later, it took center stage on my first actual bookshelf that I bought for my first apartment when I was barely an adult. It was optimistic of me to give such square footage for a bookshelf - it never got to hold more than thirty books at best, mostly becoming an open liquor cabinet (liquor shelf?). And finally, it had decorated me and Josie’s bookshelf - this one actually quite full - for years, but now it was time to find a new shelf for it to stand on.\n\nI sat down with the book, determined to finally give it the attention it had been deprived of all these years. I felt rude towards my grandma for just lugging it around all my life, never reading it, but then I thought about what my parents would’ve done to the book if I hadn’t rescued it. At best they would’ve donated it somewhere, at worst burned it and scattered the ashes in some seedy alleyway that nevere crossed God's eyes.\n\nSo now, my fellow NoSleepers, we’ve come to the bit that might actually interest someone other than my therapist. The grimoire held within its pages a slew of instructions: recipes for herby concoctions to cure sleeplessness, the right way to prepare certain (weird) ingredients, how to read rocks to see the future, and a bunch of rituals for luck, prosperity, and other vague ‘good’ things. Within these rituals there was one that caught my eye: The Two Sisters.\n\nThe section about The Two Sisters has multiple pages of prologue, which I’ll try to condense down to its main points below.\n\nBasically, throughout my grandma’s lineage, The Two Sisters have been summoned to help resolve conflict within two members of the family. In essence, when you’re in bad relations (not talking to each other, separated and what have you) they’d communicate to the other person what your 'true' feelings are. The book describes this as *‘the summoning of true love, delivered upon the loved ones heart and soul in language understood within.*’ The ritual was born of necessity, and it is to be used only as such. The sisters themselves are young and wear pale blue clothing - one of them is called Voice, the other one Face. Voice apparently has no face, but can speak, and Face - you guessed it - has no voice, but instead a long and distorted grimace. If the ritual is performed accordingly and to completion, the sisters will convey the ritual maker's feelings to the subject, and hopefully the two can then resolve their issues. \n\nAfter the prologue, there are warnings. \n\n*‘Do not perform upon non-family members.’*\n\n*‘Do not perform with impure thoughts.’*\n\n*‘Do not attempt to invoke either Sister by their lonesome.’*\n\nFollowing this, there are the step-by-step instructions for the ritual. It’s quite detailed, so bear with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-\n\n**The Two Sisters**\n\nFind yourself in a closed room after dusk, the doors closed and the windows shut. Following you, no one else may enter the room until you have left.\n\nLight two candles in front of you, two feet from each other, one on your left and one on your right. **You are the third flame, completing the ▽.**\n\nBetween the candles, place a bowl filled halfway with water. The bowl should be large enough to show the reflection of your face.\n\nAfter the room is ready, sit with your legs crossed two feet away from the bowl in front of you. **You are the third flame, completing the ▽.**\n\nRest your hands on your knees, the fingers facing upwards, and close your eyes.\n\n**You are the third flame, completing the ▽.**\n\nKeep your eyes shut until the flames of the candles burn your hands. Do not open your eyes until the flame touches you: not for movement, sound, warmth or cold. \n\nOnce the flames burn your hands, open your eyes.\n\nIf either candle is unlit or has moved from their place, **end the ritual.**\n\nIf the water bowl has been toppled over, spilled, or moved, **end the ritual.**\n\nIf you can no longer discern the walls of the room, **end the ritual.**\n\nUpon the ritual continuing, stare into the bowl of water in front of you. The candles should give enough light for the water to produce reflections.\n\n**You are the third flame, completing the ▽.** \n\nThe Two Sisters shall approach you through the water’s reflection. Once you see them, do not avert your gaze. They will float above in the reflection; as **A**bove △, so **B**elow ▽. Only look at and talk to the sisters through the reflections in the water.\n\nTell *Face* who you want to speak to and why.\n\nTell *Voice* what you want to say in your heart. Think of the loved one in your most pure desire.\n\nOnce you have talked to both sisters, blow out the candles and let them leave the room.\n\nAfter a short while, exit the room with the water bowl, and throw the water onto the earth. Do not re-enter the room until dawn.\n\nThe Two Sisters will visit your loved one the following night. The rest is up to you.\n\n**If you need to stop the ritual at any point, walk out of the room and wait until dawn to re-enter.**\n\n**Do not stay with the Two Sisters for longer than the candles burn.**\n\n\\-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that’s the ritual. I’m not going to bore you with any postulations. I was raised a christian, now I’m what I’d call so-and-so, basically *I dunno*, but I have an upbringing-induced allergy to all things spooky. Still, I’m intrigued, and I do have a couple nights alone as Josie’s staying with some friends soon.\n\nAnyone wanna try it before I do? Or can someone convince me why I shouldn’t try it, besides the creepiness? I mean, it seems like a 'good' ritual, doesn't it - at worst it's just meditation at night in a dark room.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't even know when it started. One night i was trying to fall asleep and i felt a presence in the room. As i was laying down on my bed, my consciousness slowly fading away i felt it over me like a shadow. At first, i thought it was sleep paralyses. I had them before no problem. Just stay calm. But soon i realised that i could move my hands and my legs. It soon spoke to me with its sweet voice \"Go back to sleep.\"\n\nIt was the first time it ever spoke to me. I in fact went back to sleep, wishing it was just a dream.\n\nI woke up with my alarm ringing, filling the room with not the beeping sound itself, but with its echoes. Someting was wrong. The air was wrong the noises were wrong, the room...\n\nI saw him in the empty corner of my room, a shadow with a humanoid shape. I jumped from my bed screaming but i couldnt hear my own voice.\n\nAn hour maybe half an hour or just a few minutes later i managed to move. \"Its okay\" i said out loud. \"Im just imagining things.\" I left the room running and went to school. The whole day the only thing i could thing about was the shadow. I went out for a drink with friends because i was so scared to go home. I managed to convince one of my friends to come back to my apartment for some drinks. I let him in and told him to wait for me in my room. He went in. I did not hear a scream or anything. \"It's okay\" i thought to myself. \"It was just my imagination\". I grabbed two beers and opened the door. He was sitting in my bed. I immediatly turned my head to the corner. There it was. It looked even bigger now. A little redness coming out of where i imagined its eyes were. My friend, Alex wasn't seeing him no doubt. He was going through my dvd collection. I didn't ask him if he was seeing it too. There was no point.\n\nI didn't go to my room for the next few days not even to pick up some clean clothes. But at night, i would hear things from the room. Nothing clear but just a sound, an echo, something that i wasn't supposed to hear.\n\nWhy is this happening to me?\n\nI didn't do anything wrong.\n\nNo i didnt.\n\nIt was supposed to be a game.\n\nI called them, you know. Called my friends. Jokingly talked about something following us through the stupid little ritual we did. They joked back. No, i know it was only my blood that we put into that doll. Only few drops. Now its in my house, in my room, in my head.\n\nWe were supposed to be able to talk the spirits, ghost through the doll but nothing happened. Not even a single knock from the wall. We burned the doll afterwards.\n\nIt was what that blog told us to do. To prevent the spirits, demons follow us back through it. We did it everything they said. No it can't be from that ritual.\n\nI must be crazy.\n\nI went back to the room after a week. It took me hours and a few bottle of beers to gather the courage but i did it. It was still there. I don't now what came over me but i started screaming, cursing at it. I screamed to it to give me a reason why it was here. It spoke to me, again told me to calm down. He told me \"There is no reason to be afraid of me kid. Your time here is not done yet.\"\n\nHe said very little but i knew. I knew the truth, i could feel it to my bones. He was not going to kill me but claim me or use me after i was dead. I don't know what's awaiting me in the afterlife but i know it is not very plesant.\n\nIt has been 25 years since it last spoke to me. I am not that old but i have been diagnosed with lung cancer. It is bad. I am not responding to the treatment and i might die any minute. It knows that as well. \n\nI moved couple of times but it has always claimed a corner in my bedroom. It has got much bigger now. I can almost see its mouth. I think its happy that the long waiting game is finally going to pay off. I am not going to try to fight  it, not anymore. I got some sleeping pills. I took the whole bottle. I can't think that well anymore. The words seem ... off. Anyway, I am welcoming it. I can almost feel it in my veins. There is no shadow in the corner anymore. The whole room is dark. He is in the every single atom in the room, in the oxygen i breath.",

        "text": "\nHey Reddit, I’m a 20 yr old female on TDY, so if you’re in the Army you know that pretty much means “I have too much time on my hands right now” so I’ve started getting on here and writing about the abnormal experiences that I’ve had. (For some reason, I have a vast amount looking back)\n\nTo answer some questions before the story-\n“Why didn’t you call the cops” -we were teenage stoners, we were more concerned about them finding our stash, and I never said we were smart\n\n“Why did your mom accept and not care about the things that were happening?”- we have been couch surfing most of our lives, and we were out of options and it was winter. She had to do what she could at the time\n\nAnyway, this is a pretty long read and I might have to make a part two. I’d enjoy hearing your theories in the comments.\n\nThis town deserves a post of its own. \nLet me take you guys back to 2019 to a town called “Freelandville, Indiana”, population 759, however if you visit you’d be surprised if you even saw a handful of people outside at any point.\n\nMy mom and I were living in a city about 20 miles north when we came on hard times and had to relocate fast, in a matter of a week. There was a listing on Craigslist for a rentable home described as “The peaceful Getaway you’ve been looking for”. And for only 400 a month, my mom and I went the same day to meet up with the Landlord. \n\nWhen we entered the “town” we were both kind of laughing and making jokes “Does anyone even live here?” I said. “This should be on an episode of the twilight zone” She said, looking kind of defeated knowing we would be stuck in this place until our money was right again. \n\nWe pull up to our house where the landlady was outside. We get hopeful. “It’s so cute!” She says. It’s a one story white house, with a garage and a nice garden in the front. Big backyard. My mom and I get out and the landlord is super friendly, when we go inside we immediately loved the house. It wasn’t fancy or anything, but it wasn’t ghetto by any means either, like my mother and I were used to. We know we want it right away, and we go into the living room to talk about the arrangements with the owner.\n\nThe owner explains that the house is fully furnished and it can stay this way, but she asked my mom not to move any of the furniture due to “It possibly scratching the hardwood floors”. Seems reasonable enough, I guess. But then some other rules started to raise some clear red flags. Another rule was that the cameras had to stay intact. Confused, my mom asks what cameras. The landlady points to the top of the ceilings, where we see in each room is almost an industrial type of recorder, in every room except the bathrooms. I see the look on my moms face, and she gives me a look back. A look of “don’t open your mouth right now”. My mom agrees to this rule. Another rule, “There is no lock on the front door. Don’t put a new one on because it could damage the door”. We’re weirded out at this point, but my mom agrees. And the final rule, don’t enter the basement as it’s “dangerous due to a leak”.\n\nMy mom signs the paperwork, agreeing to all these regulations. Puts down the deposit and first months rent, and we get in the car to go get our bags from the hotel we were staying in. Of course, the first thing I ask was “What the hell were you thinking?”\n\nMy mom reassures me that we’re not going to follow the rules, and of course she’s immediately taking down the cameras and putting on a lock no question about it. Before you judge her, think about what it’d be to be a single mom who’s about to have her daughter and her out on the street in the winter. It was really her only option at the time.\n\nWe come back to the house the following day with our things, and we’re estatic to finally have our own place. My mom gets a drill and takes down all the cameras except for the three outside, and she has me put a new lock and knob on the front door. It’s finally our own home. \n\nWe explore a bit, and I notice in the kitchen there’s a small crack in the wood paneling on the wall. Curious, I stick my fingernails and peel at it, and to my surprise it comes right off. “MOMMMM!” I exclaimed.\nShe comes running, “what’s wrong?!” I show her with pride my new spot I had found. It was a small “room” or I don’t know if I should say cubby, big enough to fit two people, and it had a ledge that seemed hillbilly made into being a bench of sorts.\n\nI was in love. This was going to be the best smoke room ever. (And trust me, throughout the months that I lived here, I really had turned it into something amazing. It was my pride and joy). My mom just dismissed it, she thought it was cool but wasn’t too entertained. Looking back I wonder why it was there in the first place. It’s the small things like that cubby that I never thought about until we were gone that make you wonder what was really going on in that house.\n\nThe next few weeks we had settled and things were pretty normal, except for our dog Caine had been acting a little strange, but we summed it up just to being in a new place. By strange I mean, he would stay in one spot looking out the window for hours. See, now that I look back on it that was definitely not fucking normal but hey, I was a teenager at the time who was stoned the majority of my day. I wasnt worried about ol boy.\n\nOne day the landlady came by unannounced, she tried to just open the door but of course it was locked. So she knocked and I came and let her in. She was very friendly, like always, and she asked to take a look around. I said sure, she came in checked around and asked how everything was. She asked if I had ventured down into the basement, and I said no, that we hadn’t had any interest and that we remembered there was a leak down there.\n\n“I think you would think it’s pretty neat, if you want you and I can go down there and take a look around”. I started to feel uncomfortable, as my mom was at work as usual and I didn’t know why this lady would be wanting to take me down there. I told her I was good off that but I thanked her. She applauded me on my handiwork on the front door and noticed I had made the cubby in the kitchen more welcoming. She told me maybe I can help her fix some other stuff someday. \n\nShe then started to leave and told me to have my mom get ahold of her. I assumed it was because of the cameras and front door, but she didn’t bring it up to me and she went on her way. And she didn’t really ever come check on us again after that",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11dydes/in_1748_i_was_offered_a_gift_i_couldnt_refuse_i/) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay wow, I wasn’t expecting that much attention from my previous post. I had fun reading everyone’s comments and replying to them. I think that was the most interaction I had with other people in the last six months. Anyways, one person had asked me about some of my other experiences which prompted me to make this post. I will only talk about one experience for this post since I have a lot to write, but if you’d like to hear about my other experiences let me know. \n\nOkay, so yes, you read the title right; I encountered a real life vampire hunter. This happened after the incident in 1823 where I was shot in the neck. Apparently, I was shot by a hunter and upon discovering he shot a human, he ran back to his town and didn’t say anything in fear of what people would think. Well fast forward a few days and he finally cracks and tells his family. The family then decided to find my body and bury it in the woods so no one would know.\n\nUnfortunately for both them and me, I had already awakened and had visited that town. They used his hunting dog to track my scent to where I was laid in the woods but I was no longer there. Not knowing what to do they went back to town when the hunter spotted me.\n\n“Vam-vampire,” he shouted in fear.\n\nMultiple people looked around and began whispering. I looked around as well, I mean, I didn’t think he was talking about me. \n\nThat was until he pointed to me, “It’s him, he’s the vampire!”\n\nI was naturally taken aback by this, did he honestly think I was a vampire? How did he come to that conclusion? And then it clicked as just days prior I was shot in the neck. \n\nBefore I could respond, a town resident responded, “You’re crazy! Vampires don’t exist and even if they did, they wouldn’t be in the sunlight.”\n\nThe hunter’s family came to his defense, “It’s true, he shot that man in the neck and we went to go to the woods and bury his body, but he was gone! What else is he if not a vampire?!”\n\nA silence settled over the people as they nervously looked at me. I had to leave, sure they can’t kill me, but I’d rather not experience the pain of a wooden stake to the heart. I ran, pushing people aside. This caused some to erupt in screams, I guess thinking I was going to hurt them. Finding a horse, I jumped on it and rode it as fast it could go.\n\nAfter that, I tried to keep away from towns, who knows how fast the news spread. I’m sure some would find it ridiculous that there was a ‘vampire’ sighting, but others would believe the townspeople and hunt me down. Or in other words, vampire hunters. I know what it sounds like, but even in the early 1800s there still existed vampire hunters. Did they ever actually kill vampires? No, most people killed were those who went comatose with a barely noticeable heartbeat and buried alive. \n\nSome woke up and were able to escape their coffins and some ended up dying. Those who lived and tried to go back home were labeled as a vampire and killed. It’s quite sad really. \n\nAnyways, fast forward two months and it is now 1824. I visited quite a big city, a mistake on my part. As I walked through the city, I noticed someone was following me. While I may only be immortal, being alive for almost 100 years by this point has sharpened my senses. So I could easily tell I was being followed. \n\nI turned down an alleyway quickly and hid out of the followers' sight. As I suspected he rushed into the alleyway but didn’t see me. He stood there for a few minutes and I contemplated if I should show myself. Before I had made up my mind, he left the alleyway quickly. I breathed a sigh of relief and left the alleyway on the opposite end. \n\nI found an inn on the outskirts of the city and paid for my stay there. There weren’t a lot of people here so I figured it wouldn’t hurt to stay inside for the night. I wished I had just decided to stay outside that night, however. I was sitting in my room, on my bed, reading a book. Upon hearing a knock on my door, I got up and answered it. \n\nBefore I could even react, a stake was stabbed into my chest and punctured my heart. I grabbed at the stake as I got a good luck at the man. *How did he find me?* My knees hit the floor as blood pooled in my mouth before running down my chin. I coughed, choking on the blood. \n\n“This is what you deserve, you deceitful vampire,” he said with disdain.\n\nI paid no attention to him as fear clouded my mind. *No.. no.. no.. no.. NO! I don’t want to experience this pain ten-fold.* I tried whatever I could to keep a grasp on my slipping consciousness. *Please! Not again, I don’t want to do this again!* I pleaded in my mind, hoping for mercy.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was reliving that pain. I relived the moment over and over again, the pain increased by ten-fold. I cried out to the strange man for a reprieve from this pain, but I was met with silence. \n\nEventually, I woke to the soft, grainy feeling of dirt. My eyes shot open just before dirt landed on me. I looked up at the man that had stabbed me in the heart. His eyes were wide with disbelief as he saw me alive. The stake was still in my chest, so I grabbed it and pulled it out. It hurt for a moment before the wound healed.\n\n“H-how is that p-possible?” he stuttered out.\n\nI struggled up, not bothering to answer him. \n\n“I-I stabbed you in the heart with a stake! I poured holy water over you and blessed your body! How are you not dead?!” he yelled out as he fell back.\n\nI finally made it out of the grave and stared at him. My body shuddered as it remembered the pain I had experienced. My mind trembled as I continually replayed that moment over and over. I bent over and hurled the little food I had in my system. \n\nI finally got my bearings and paid attention to the man, “You. Who are you?”\n\n“Why should I tell you?” he retorted.\n\n“I mean, you don’t have to, but you made me experience that pain again. I’m not feeling the best at the moment so I advise you to answer me before I decide what to do with you,” I responded in a monotone voice.\n\nThis diminished what little pride he had left, “I-I’m a Vampire Hunter and I was told of a man fitting your description surviving a bullet to the neck. Naturally, I rushed to that town to receive a drawing of what you looked like. I-I just don’t get it, how are you not dead?” \n\n“That’s a long story, but I’m not a vampire,” I said with a sigh, “Just leave, get out of here.”\n\nI didn’t have to tell him twice as he quickly scrambled towards his horse and left. I finally looked around at my surroundings and saw I was at a church. I couldn’t help but to sigh once more as I started walking down the road as well.\n\nYou may think that is the end of this experience, but you are unfortunately wrong. You know those bullies where, by themselves you can scare them off, but they later come back with their bully friends and gang up on you? Yeah, that’s this guy, except his friends had guns and stakes. \n\nA good four months into 1824, I ran into him and his friends. Before I explain that little incident, please remember that while I am immortal and pride myself on my fighting skills; I’m not invulnerable, have super strength, and endless stamina. Fighting six people with weapons is not easy. \n\nAnyways, after the incident before, I tried to stick to just camping in the woods and only passing through cities and towns when I had no other choice. Days prior, I had noticed that I was being tailed, but I could never find the people. They would disappear when I searched for them. I tried not to focus on it because I figured I was just being paranoid. While I was camped out in the woods that night when I was ambushed by six attackers. All of which had weapons such as guns, swords, and stakes.\n\nI had just started drifting off to sleep when I heard a twig snap. This jolted me awake as I looked around. Before I knew it, the sound of a gun went off and I instinctively dodged the bullet, but it still struck me in the side. I clenched my teeth as the pain burned throughout my body. \n\n“Show yourself!” I shouted out.\n\nAnd like that, six people emerged from the darkness of the trees. The only one I recognized was that man from four months prior.\n\n“You, didn’t you figure out that stakes don’t work?” I hissed.\n\n“It’s different now, demon, we know how to kill you,” he responded.\n\nI couldn’t help but to laugh out of both anger and fear, “Sure, whatever you say, but didn’t you run away last time with your tail between your legs?”\n\nHis face contorted, “I was merely making a tactical retreat, you are much more dangerous than a vampire! It couldn’t be helped!”\n\nBefore I had a chance to respond, one of the members of his group shot their gun at me again. I couldn’t move in time and it struck me in the leg. I yelped in pain and I went down on one knee. Three of them then rushed at me with their swords drawn. I stood back up and protected my vital spots, taking most of the slashes on my arms and legs. \n\nMy skin burned as it was cut by the sharp blades. Blood dripped from the wounds and splattered onto the ground before they could heal. I found an opening and tackled one of them to the ground, removing his sword. I now had the sword and sliced the arms of the others, but before I could move in I was shot at once more. A bullet grazed my cheek while another lodged itself into my arm. \n\nBy now, I was breathing heavily and exhausted. My wounds were healing but it still didn’t mean the pain didn’t slow me down. After making a large swing at them, I took off running into the woods. My leg that had gotten shot, was just now healing after my flesh pushed the bullet from the wound. I ran as fast as I could from both adrenaline and fear. The memory of being staked was still seared painfully into my mind as was the pain I experienced.\n\nI could hear them hot on my trail, their shouts echoing through the woods. Couldn’t they just leave me be? What the hell is wrong with them? I ran as fast as I could before my heart sank to my stomach. From ahead, I could hear the rushing water of a waterfall. I picked my pace up before skidding to a halt at a cliff that stood above water. The waterfall was feet from me. \n\nI looked back at my pursuers and decided right then and there. Taking a few steps back, I ran and launched myself from the cliff. I noticed a root just below, if I timed it right, I could grab it and cling to the cliff's edge. I plummeted and like some miracle, I grabbed hold of the root, breaking my arm. I clenched my teeth as I grabbed it with my other hand. I basically dug my nails into the rocky edge and laid evenly against it as much as I could. \n\nI heard the pursuers above, “He really jumped, didn’t he?”\n\nAnother one sighed, “He’s long gone now, the current would have taken him away quickly.”\n\n“Dammit, just when we had him. That sly devil just had to weasel himself out of it,” an all too familiar voice responded.\n\n“It’s alright Joshua, we will track him down again,” another said.\n\nI heard their footsteps grow distant, but waited there for what felt like hours. My arm fully healed and I began climbing up the cliff. It wasn’t that far down from where I was, but one wrong move and I was falling into that water. From this height, I’d shatter my bones. \n\nFinally, after almost fifteen grueling minutes, I reached the top and pulled myself over the cliff. I laid flat on my back as I took in deep breaths. I laid there for the longest time, replaying the events that had just transpired in my head. I got up eventually, and discreetly made my way from the forest and away from that region all together. Ever since then, I stayed off their radar and didn’t appear around the public, until I traveled to England.\n\nWell that’s the end of this experience I had with real life vampire hunters. I’m glad I never encountered them again. It was quite the frightening experience, especially since I was still mentally recovering from being shot in the neck and experiencing that hell for the first time. My advice is, if you ever encounter someone with a stake and crucifix, run the opposite direction as fast as you can.",

        "text": " \n\nI just found this in one of the top drawers of my desk in the apartment block I moved into last week. It's a nice place, one bedroom, bathroom, kitchen/living room combo. Cheap too. Nice area, plus I got a flat that overlooked the inner courtyard. Bedroom was surprisingly well furnished, bed, wardrobe, desk with a lamp and chair, beanbag and spare mattress.\n\nBut I was looking through the cabinets and drawers and stuff, just to check that the previous tenant hadn't forgot anything. I think it's a joke. It's not very funny if so. Maybe the landlord figured out I was moving in alone and told the old resident as some form of prank, like a mild hazing ritual, you know?  \n\nIt's a letter, written on some sort of old-style blotting paper. It's slightly crinkled and dry with age like it was done many years ago. Written in some form of fountain/ink pen. It gets... scrawled and hard to read towards the end. \n\nIt reads:\n\n*\"You. Whoever you are.*\n\n*When the clock strikes ten to midnight.*\n\n*Don't look in the shadows.*\n\n*Seriously.*\n\n*Don't.*\n\n*I know it may be hard, especially now that I've told you not too, but hold strong and*\n\n*Don't* \n\n*Look.*\n\n*Not even a glance.*\n\n*Not even out of the corner of your eye.*\n\n*Don't look.*\n\n*I hope you never feel them.

It's just a joke, right? The creepy thing is, the shadows seem a little darker right now, and there was no light from the lamp when I turned it on. And I checked the weather. It's meant to be cloudy tonight too. But it's just a joke, right? Right?",

        "text": "I, 28M, and my girlfriend, 24F, have been together for 5 years. We have a 3 year old son together. She has a history of being sexually abused all thru her childhood which led to extreme hyper sexuality during her high school years. Like super extreme. When we first met she was open and honest about the hyper sexuality because it was kind of well known what her reputation was around town and without going into much detail explained she was heavily abused as a child. I never held it against her and continued to pursue this relationship because we all have pasts and I genuinely fell in love with her. No judgement, no further digging deep, no anything. I was once very confident with myself and felt like someones past would not interfere with a relationship. Shes never had a serious boyfriend before and I felt in my heart she needed someone to take her seriously. I felt like she just needed to be loved and I wanted to be that person for her. Down the line red flags were flying everywhere. It started with her talking shit about me in posts on her finsta account. I was annoyed and found it immature but moved on. She would still keep in contact with old sexual partners and hangout with them. I was like no this isn’t acceptable. She admitted to still being in love after the first year of our relationship with the guy she wanted to go out with before me but he played her numerous times. She hooked up (made out) and went to a party with her first and only girl on girl sexual experience (she’s bi) telling me she was just a friend. After 18 months in I made a list of all the things she did to me similar to those examples and 21 scenarios in total came up. She then promised to start over and made an effort to be 100% into our relationship. She swore up on down that the most she ever did physically was make out with that girl and never did anything sexual with anybody. I didn’t believe her but never had any proof otherwise. I know I’m a stranger to those reading this but I am not a pussy or a simp. In the most humble way possible I was once looked upon not as a “player” by any means but I never had any problems in the women department ever. I just fell so deeply in love with this girl and I know deep down she just needed to be loved. Her parents were aware of her being abused as a child and never did anything about it. Not only that but they kicked her out of the house and took the side of one of the people abusing her. I cant imagine what that must be like. There were multiple people who did this to her. I stuck around because after doing some research I figured this was some self sabotaging thing she would do because not only did her family abandon her, her biological mother left her when she was a baby. But I was up to the challenge because as someone who has dealt with trauma themselves (not to this extent) I was not going to give up on her. Time went on and she was actually trying her best, she wasn’t perfect but she was trying. However I was so hurt and felt so betrayed by those 21 scenarios and it kept playing in my head. Not only that but it was more the fact I had to find things out myself because she looked me dead in my face and lied about everything after I kept asking her. The only reason I found out the truth was because I had undeniable proof that I presented her which made her fess up. It never came from her on her own. Which made me question everything even more. My confidence sunk tremendously, my will to chase my dreams became non existent, and my depression/anxiety went to a very high place. All of these scenarios would play in my head over and over which made me resent her to an extent. Then all of a sudden she gets pregnant. I was so happy and excited but when she was pregnant she turned from really trying to be more present with our relationship to extremely abusive and hurtful. I chalked it up to just hormones and tried my best to be patient on top of dealing with what I was dealing with internally. Our son was born and I was beyond ecstatic. He is the light of my life. Postpartum was absolutely horrific. She was so verbally, physically, and emotionally abusive it would get to the point where I just swallowed my pride and chalked it up to postpartum depression ON TOP of her childhood trauma. After the first year of our son being born the abuse from her never stopped. It just got worse. She would belittle me everyday, hit me at least once a week, she was just an overall bully. 3 years later and the patterns of her abuse have not stopped. I have sunk so deep into a depression I lost 25 pounds have no willpower to do anything and have lost myself in all the ways I could imagine. Everyday for 3 years she has treated me like shit. I broke down. Now she says shes not attracted to me anymore because I am just a shell of myself. We have sex once or twice a month TOPS. I feel so betrayed because even tho I should not have allowed myself to let her have that much power over me, this is a direct correlation of her actions since the beginning of our relationship. I have tried all I can for years but I am at my breaking point. How can I help her? What can I do to save my family? She threatened me that I will only get to see my son every other weekend and I cannot live my life like that. He is my everything. SHE was the one who ruined the foundation of our relationship and she still has leverage over our son. I feel so broken and lost. Today was the day after 5 years that I lost my cool. I finally snapped. She went out with her friend the other night who I am not fond of because she is a bad influence on her. They mock me, they laugh at me, they talk shit about me. Always put me down. I don’t want to tell her not to be friends with her because I’m not the controlling type so I just let it be. However she went out with her and got home at 4am completely drunk. The next day something told me when I was showering to look at her phone. I found her replying back to guys calling her cute, I found her adding random guys back on social medias, I found her searching that old guy she wanted back in the day up on her facebook history. I woke her up and snapped. I threw her phone against the wall and it shattered. I was saying such low blows to her and using her past against her. I was so disgusted in myself for the way I acted and spoke to her because I got out of character. Its just FIVE YEARS LATER and the same patterns were continuing.  Yes I’ve had my bad moments since then but this was super bad. I am EXTREMELY patient and understanding but I am human. I’m not justifying how I acted just explaining how it got there. I got so triggered I didn’t know what to do. Even with all of that I feel obligated to be here for her. Something in my spirit tells me she is broken inside. Theres times within her abuse towards me that she looks at me and I melt because I see her inner self hurting and looking for love. Even could see her loving me deep down. She tried therapy but gave up once things got really deep. The way she treats me is just unacceptable tho. Its really bad and I don’t deserve it. I am FAR from perfect and there are things I should have done differently in regards to us. But I don’t deserve this. I just feel like after all she put me thru I never gave up on her but the second I lose myself because of HER abuse she gives up on me? I think she is a bit narcissistic and is suffering from some undiagnosed BPD along with everything else. I love her and deep down I know she is a good person. I feel like me not giving up on her would make her realize I am here for her. Regardless of all shes done I am still here trying to fight for her but she keeps pushing me away and abusing me. She says shes over me, doesn’t love me, and never did. She says she never felt connected sexually or emotionally to me or anybody else before me. she would say “see this is why you should just leave me”. One of the worst parts for me is she shows so much love and empathy to her family that allowed this abuse to happen to her. Is all of this tied to her abuse from childhood? Would childhood sexual abuse and hyper sexuality cause her to be so detached and disassociated from our relationship among other things? Another reason why I stay is because she still has a relationship with her family that abused her and allowed other people to abuse her too. They condone pedophilia and she has secretly brought them over when I was out of the house to see our son. I cannot allow that let alone give up 50% of custody. I really feel that she just only accepts the love she feels she deserves. I want to save our relationship and I want to save our family. I just don’t know how much more I can take or what else I can do. All I’ve tried is to love her unconditionally and aim to protect her. Just wanted to be her shoulder to cry on while she healed. Sincerely. I really do not want to give up on her. If you took the time to read this entirely I appreciate you greatly. God bless",

That arm must have been ten feet long!” I quickly shut the curtains.\n\n“Get Sarah,” I said, referring to our only child, “and go to the basement. Grab as many canned foods and bottles of water as you can.” I ran upstairs to get my shotgun, grabbing a couple boxes of slugs and buckshot and throwing them in a canvas bag.\n\nPolice and ambulance sirens flew by outside, but I paid them no mind. They wouldn’t be able to help much, if at all. We had tried calling a few minutes earlier, but the line had been busy. It was the first time I had ever heard of 911 giving a busy signal.\n\nAs we all settled in the basement, a couple boxes of food and water next to us on the table, I found an old radio I kept down here in storage. It was covered in dust, but I blew on it, sending a gray cloud of it into the air. My wife started coughing. I sheepishly apologized, plugging the radio in and turning it on.\n\n“...civil broadcast from the United States government,” a robotic female voice stated. “As of 9 AM Eastern Standard Time, martial law is being declared for your local area. All emergency services are suspended until further notice. Please stay in your homes and await further instructions. Help is on the way. This is not a test.” Then a loud beeping sound issued from the radio, and the message started to repeat. I tried changing the station, but it was coming through on every one.\n\nSomeone started slamming on the door upstairs, and I heard the kitchen window directly above us being smashed. \n\n“Be quiet,” I whispered to my wife and daughter. They trembled, pale statues in the darkness of the basement. I heard heavy footsteps above us, and the sound of someone dragging something. \n\nFrom further down the street, I heard screaming and wood being smashed, as if someone were kicking in a door. It sounded like a car had driven into the house next door. I heard the shattering glass and rending metal of the car hitting a structure, then a piercing woman’s shriek. The smell of smoke began to permeate the night air.\n\nI also heard what sounded like children screaming in our front yard, and a woman who was probably their mother trying to yell instructions at them.\n\n“Run!” she said. “Get away from…” Then her voice was cut off with a deep gurgling, choking sound. The voices of her children went soon after. I had a small window in the basement, and I could see thick, gray clouds of smoke outside. It obscured my view of what was going on further down the street.\n\n“Should we go help them?” my wife said. She grabbed my hand reflexively. Her hand felt cold and I could feel her pulse through her skin. I shook my head.\n\n“Beth, we have our own child to worry about,” I said. “The radio says martial law is declared, which means we just have to wait for the military to arrive.” I listened for movement upstairs, but nothing else was happening that I could hear. I turned back on the radio. The robotic voice had stopped its monotonous repetition and now a deep man’s voice was speaking. He sounded calm and unhurried. I caught the tail end of what he was saying.\n\n“The situation is under control,” he said. “I repeat, the US military has the situation under control. What we ask from you, citizens of our great country, is this: do not drink the water. Do not shower in the water. Do not cook with the water. Don’t even wash your hands with the water. Only drink previously bottled water or other drinks. We believe this outbreak is the result of a localized infection of the town’s water supply. An evacuation is in progress. Please stay in your homes. For your safety, phone calls, text messages and internet access will be restricted. We will report back when more information is available.” The voice ended abruptly, and the robotic voice started speaking again.\n\n“This is a civil broadcast from the United States government. As of 9:15 AM Eastern Standard Time, martial law…” I turned the radio back off. I looked at my wife. She was terrified.\n\n“Have any of you drank any of the tap water lately?” I asked Sarah and Beth. They all shook their heads in unison. Luckily, all three of us drank a lot of milk and juice. I always cursed how expensive it was, having to buy an entire gallon of whole milk and a carton of orange juice every other day, but now I was thanking God for their taste.\n\nFrom the second floor of our house, we heard crashing and smashing, then a deep voice shouting. It sounded like someone was dragging a body down the stairs. A woman started crying, then her voice was cut off.\n\n“What’s going on up there, daddy?” my youngest daughter asked, looking up at me with her big blue eyes. She looked so small and helpless in the dim light of the basement. She was holding a brown stuffed rabbit I had given her when she was a baby, which she had named Dr. Hoppy. I don’t know where he got his medical degree from, but he seemed to be doing a good job of keeping her calm, so I appreciated his bedside manner.\n\n“Sarah,” I said, getting down to my knee so I was on her level and putting my hand on her shoulder, “I think there are sick people all around us. But help is on the way.” She held her little rabbit up to me.\n\n“Is Dr. Hoppy going to get sick too?” she asked in a whisper.\n\n“No, Dr. Hoppy is a doctor. He knows more than we do about staying healthy,” I said, smiling at her. Then something started smashing against the basement door, causing all of us to jump.\n\nI chambered a round into my Benelli, the 12-gauge giving a satisfying ringing noise. I looked up the rickety stairs, waiting. At this distance, I could easily shoot through the basement door with a slug, but I wanted to make sure it wasn’t a police officer or military personnel or even just a neighbor looking for help. I wished I had cameras in the house.\n\nBut as I was looking up the stairs, something came crashing through the small basement window instead. My wife and daughter jumped, yelling.\n\n“Get behind me!” I said, turning the gun in the direction of the noise. I saw what looked like a toddler, still wearing cartoon characters on his clothes. But something was very wrong with his body and face.\n\nTendrils of gray and red roots seemed to grow out of his body, criss-crossing across his skin. One eye cried blood as he looked at me, and the other had tiny, gray worms crawling out of it. I could still see his pupils, though, and apparently he could see me, for he began to run forward towards me at a superhuman speed.\n\nHis mouth was opened, letting blood-red vines with spikes shoot out in my direction. Even though I watched the spectacle with open-mouthed horror, my instincts still kicked in enough for me to know I needed to put him down. Without thinking, I fired a shot directly into his head.\n\nHe was so small that the exit wound of the slug blew the entire back of his head off. He fell back, as if in slow motion. I saw gray and red tendrils whipping around crazily, moving much faster and more erratically as he died. Some of them morphed at an increased rate, sending thorns and spikes shooting out, and others wrapped around the child’s body, as if trying to protect him from further damage. But it was too late. \n\nWithin seconds of him laying on the ground, the energy behind the tendrils seemed to weaken. The spikes receded back inside, and they began to fall randomly around and on top of his body, no longer moving. A few new smaller tendrils shot out from the bullet wound, but those also quickly lost energy, instead falling back into the blood and gore of his face.\n\nBehind me, Sarah and Beth were still crying. I turned, seeing Sarah burying her face in Dr. Hoppy, trying not to look. Beth stared at me with wide, unseeing eyes. She reminded me of pictures I had seen of shell-shocked soldiers returning from a horrifying war.\n\nIn the excitement, I had forgotten about the basement door. I heard metal clattering from the direction of the door and then the lock slowly turned. The door swung open. And what I saw there was not another person possessed by the vines, like I had expected.\n\nA robed man with a bone-white face stared down at me. His hands looked skeletal, almost like deformed claws, and his eyes were pure black. He smiled at me, an inhumanly wide grin that showed multiple blood-red tongues flicking in different directions.\n\n“I have seen you,” he said in a voice that sounded like thousands of voices swarming and echoing on top of one another. “You will make it, Jason. I will return to you at the end of your journey. You are the only one with the ability to make it out of here.”\n\n“What about my family?” I said, tears clouding my vision, pointing at my daughter and wife. The hooded man shrugged.\n\n“That depends on your actions,” he said. “It is no concern of mine. My concern is that you make it out. Much relies on your survival. But I do not intercede with mortal affairs much. I only came to give you a warning…”\n\n“What warning?” I asked, feeling frantic.\n\n“Do not trust the man in white.” With that, he turned, beginning to walk away slowly. The black robe he wore rippled and shimmered as if it were made of silk.\n\n“Wait! What’s your name?” I asked, but he ignored my question. I looked at my Beth and Sarah, who were staring at me, open-mouthed. Within seconds, the man’s footsteps faded into nothing.\n\n“I think it’s time we got out of here,” I said to them. “Prepare a few backpacks with some food and water. We will have to split whatever we can carry between the three of us. I need to go get some things from upstairs before we leave, though. I think we might have a long journey ahead of us.” My wife nodded, going through the storage supplies and finding a few bags. I didn’t want to leave them alone for even an instant, so I stayed with them while she packed. We gave Sarah a small bag with a few cans of food and water. Sarah also put Dr. Hoppy in it. \n\n“Sorry, Dr. Hoppy,” Sarah said, frowning as she zipped up the backpack. “I know you don’t like small spaces, but it is only for a little while.”\n\nBeth and I split heavier bags with more food and water, but we didn’t overload them, as I had the feeling we might need to run.\n\nAfter we finished preparing in the basement, we went upstairs. I saw bodies all over our kitchen. I recognized the bodies of our neighbors and a couple other people from town. They all had gray and red vines sticking out of their skin, unmoving. Some of them had blood pouring from both eyes, while others had mostly clear faces. \n\nRegardless, it looked like the robed man had torn them limb from limb. There were arms with red vines coming out of the bones, decapitated heads with gray tendrils loosely hanging down from their throats, and other horrors I don’t want to reflect on here. I covered Sarah’s eyes as we led her past the carnage, going upstairs.\n\nI found a phone up there, a special model with encryption and VPNs installed that I kept for emergencies. My technologically-savvy friend had given it to me, and now I tried turning it on and connecting. I was able to get through some of the government restrictions and connect to a weak internet source. No calls or texts would go through, however.\n\nBut I wanted to at least write up my story to let people know what’s happening. The government will almost certainly try to cover up what is happening in our town. I plan on getting my family out and letting the world know the truth, however- no matter the cost.",

        "text": "Hello, Travis Marcella here, If you would like to know what had happened previously... Go here; [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11kc214/i_didnt_follow_my_fathers_rules_and_ive_uncovered/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI Didn't sleep well that night but It didn't really matter anyway. My father made me stay home so I could process what happened or whatever. I honestly don't feel safe around him anymore, It's like he is an entirely different person. I snooped around in his room and found some strange documents about some....research facility? I'm not completely sure but I didn't get a good look at it as my father was about to enter the room. I hid in the closet until he left, which took a painfully long time.\n\nAs i went back to my room, I remembered the rules my father had told me about and realized I had probably broken rule 4, I had screamed when I saw one of the creatures but That didn't explain how those creatures got in downstairs but I assumed that the door wasn't locked or that my father had responded to the things.\n\nI walked out of my room and attempted to open the door...no luck. My father had locked us inside the house for some reason. I searched for my father to confront him but he had left the cabin without me realizing.\n\n\"D-Dad\"?! I yelled but got no response.\n\nI looked out the window to see that the sun was setting. My heart dropped as i realized that my dad's shotgun was also gone. I watched as the sun completely disappeared on the horizon, Night was approaching.\n\nI banged on the front door, desperately hoping that it would break and I could go find my father. It was a stupid idea but surprisingly, It worked. I felt a rush of cool air as i realized how cold it was. I went to get a coat but went against it as my father could be in danger at this very moment. I ran off to the treeline behind the cabin and looked for any sign of my father. I saw that there were footprints in the ground that resembled my father's boots. I followed the trail into the forest...\n\nAfter following the trail for a while, I started seeing shadows in the corner of my eye. I shuddered at the thought of me being chased and started picking up my pace. The shadows seemed to be getting closer and closer until I could almost swear I was seeing them.\n\nI kept running when suddenly the shadows hurdled forward and landed a couple feet in front of me. I heard a guttural screech that made me sick to my stomach. I watched as 5 giant spiders crawled towards me.\n\n\"NO,no no no no no no\"! I screamed as they were almost a foot away from me now.\n\nSuddenly I watched as the ground beneath me started cracking and 2 giant, brown claws emerged from the ground and crushed all 5 spiders and then tried to attack me as well I barrel rolled out of the way just in time to dodge the giant claws as they crashed back into the earth. Seeing that danger was at every corner, I ran faster as I continued following my father's footprints and they eventually led me into a clearing.\n\nThe clearing was pretty empty except for a small warehouse in the middle of it. I ran to it and opened the door to see my father on an old looking computer, typing in a report file.\n\n\"Dad-\"! I Said before being immediately cut off.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing here, Travis\"?! He yelled hysterically.\n\nWe both turned to the open door behind us to see about 8 large shadows heading into our direction.\n\n\"Y-You led them to us\"?! He screamed as he grabbed his shotgun.\n\n\"Dad...I-I'm so sorry... I was just worried about you- You broke one of the rules\"! I protested.\n\n\"Your right... I should not have provoked them in the first place. I wish I didn't have to burden you with this, Travis\". He sighed.\n\n\"B-Burden me with what\"? I asked.\n\n\"Go to the computer and type in 1-0-0-1. It will send an emergency response team to this location and maybe...just MAYBE, we will be saved. Stay in the warehouse and DO NOT LEAVE\". He commanded.\n\n\"D-Dad wait, What about you\"? I asked but he was already gone\n\n\"I am going to distract them for as long as possible\" He shouted back at me.\n\nWe parted ways as i closed and locked the warehouse door. I quickly typed in 1-0-0-1 on the computer and a code orange was sent to someone called \"Site Director\". I quickly turned to the only window in the warehouse and stared out, hoping I could see if my father was ok. All I saw was the impossible amount of shadows headed toward where my father ran. I haven't even heard any gunshots yet.\n\nI tried to process what was happening as I sat down on the floor and started hyperventilating. During the past couple days, I've been questioning my sanity as these shadow spiders or whatever were stalking me and my father. Now, I'm trapped in my dad's secret warehouse where he works for some kind of facility. I tried to wrap my head around this all when I heard the first gunshot, followed by a screech so loud that my ears felt like they were on fire. I covered my ears as more gunshots rang out into the night as well as several more screeches.\n\nAfter a while, to my horror, I stopped hearing any gunshots. I heard the sound of scuttling feet, way too many feet, as the shadows approached the warehouse. I stopped looking out the window at this point and hid under my fathers desk as the shadows climbed around the warehouse, searching for a way inside.\n\nI saw that a shadow had blocked out the window's light and I knew the end was near. Surprisingly, I faintly heard the sound of a helicopter in the distance, followed by what felt like, a mini gun, barreling many bullets into the hull of the warehouse, obliterating many of the shadows in the process. \n\nSomeone kicked down the door and searched the room. It took a couple seconds before the person found me and escorted me out of the warehouse. They told me to get into the helicopter as all I could do was follow their instructions.\n\nWe flew for what felt like hours and eventually landed on top of some large building that looked like some abandoned office complex. Me and 4 other people climbed down a ladder that led to the front door of the building. I asked if my father was ok but I was ignored and ushered into some kind of large closet that held a single bed with a desk,a chair, a computer, and a bookcase that filled with books about a bunch of random thing's like \"A Beginner's Guide To Crypozoology\" and \"How To Shoot A Gun\".\n\nThese books were strange but luckily I also found some comic books. I wanted answers but I was stuck in this room and I had no more control in this situation. For the first time in a long time, I cried. This whole situation seemed like some fever dream and I don't even know if my father is ok. Yea, he might have been drunk a lot but still, He was my father.\n\nI banged on the door but it was locked and made of what looks like steel. I guess the silver lining is that the computer allows me to access the internet. So I'm posting again, like I promised.\n\nI'm not sure what to do at this point but I will keep in touch with you all.",

        "text": "She lives at Sunny Smiles in a retirement home in Red Pine, Colorado, a quaint mountain-town out in the White River National Forest area. If you like camping, Red Pine is the best kept secret in the state. It’s only a short drive away from the Bells. Shaded, beautiful camping spots tuck away behind dense Aspen woodlands and curved roads that make you forget you’re within arm’s reach of the town if you find yourself in need of some supplies. That’s how I stumbled upon Sunny Smiles for the first time a decade back. \n\n The thing is huge, its crisp white paint sticks out like a lighthouse. If you could get past that distinct smell of near-death that accumulates in homes for the elderly, the inside was a palace. Vaulted ceilings with golden trim held up by pillars taken straight from Ancient Greece and crisp dark red carpeting lined a pathway to the large wooden desk. The lady at the front desk offered me a tour. They sold me on it before we even made it back to the lobby. \n\n So when my mom developed dementia a decade later, I convinced my dad to move her in there. It was a fight, to be sure. Dad didn’t like the idea of living separately from my mom. I couldn’t blame him. They’d been together for nearly 50 years. But, thankfully, my dad has always been a rational person. He knew that day was coming. I don’t think it made him hate it any less. But once I got my dad into the place and talking to the staff, he knew. He even ended up selling his house and moving closer to Aspen, just to be closer to her. \n\n I admit I haven’t gotten around to visiting her as much as I, or she, would like. Mom isn’t shy to hide that from me. But it’s an hour out of my way, and even harder in the winter. I justified it because I thought she’d be happy there. I struggled to imagine otherwise. She was living better than I was. Besides, the first few times I came to see her, she raved about the place. Good food, friendly staff, tons of activities and freedom to roam. Dad could visit as much as he wanted. She had even made friends. \n\n“Oh stop, Frank, you know I’m married,” Mom said, unable to hide a blush. I forced a smirk onto my face. After forty-something years of marriage to my dad, it was uncomfortable to watch someone so blatantly flirt with her. But man, you wouldn’t believe how much they flirt. All of them, with everybody. Except my mom, thank God. It’s a goddamn sorority house in there. \n\n A muscled young nurse walked by and shook his head at the scene. \"Give it up, Frank, you old dog,\" he said. Frank loosed a boyish giggle, keeping his attention fixed on my mom. \n\n\"I’ll get you up here someday.\" Frank winked, a huge grin plastered onto his cheeks. \"Marie?\" He turned and held his hand out, which was filled a moment later by Marie’s thin, wrinkled fingers. Frank spun her slowly, as well as the older folks can, and whistled while she turned. Together they danced, humming an old tune between giggles and smiles. \n\n Down on the other end of the lobby, a thin, elderly woman joined along in humming the song, rocking and swaying in her seat, her eyes closed, holding a raggedy brown teddy bear. \n\n Across from me, an old grandfather clock chimed three o’clock, and everyone froze. Not just Frank, Marie, and my mom, but everyone else in the lobby. Frank’s smile had faded to a gentle grin pulling at the corners of his mouth. \n\n\"See y’all at dinner?\" The group nodded and muttered goodbyes to each other. The lobby was completely empty in less than five minutes. \n\n Back in her room, my mom handed me a cup of hot tea, which I stirred in my hands for a few long moments, lost in thought. \"Mom, what was that?\"\n\n\"What was what, dear?\" She asked, taking a sip of tea as she sat down in a pink antique chair across from me. \n\n\"Why did everyone leave so suddenly?\"\n\n\"Oh, it’s nothing really. Frank and Marie like to take naps around this time. It’s routine.\" A single loud knock cracked on a door in the hall outside the room. Mom smiled gently. \"I appreciate you coming down here to meet my friends.\"\n\n I chuckled. \"Frank sure is something.\" I resisted calling him \"Mr. Frank.\" Despite being in my mid-forties, it still took a deliberate effort to call my mom’s friends by their first name. Mom blushed again. \n\n Another knock echoed through the empty hall outside. One door closer. In a blink and you’ll miss it moment, my mom’s eyes flickered towards the door before landing back on mine. I planted the best imitation of school-yard mockery into my voice before pressing my mom further on Frank. \"So… you like him?\"\n\n\"Sure, Steve. He makes me happy. But… not like that. I still love your dad.\" Her face lit up at the mere mention of him. “Look at those beautiful flowers he left!” It was the same arrangement of flowers that my dad came and dropped off every few weeks, but she loved them every time. Honestly, I found it pretty incredible. Over 40 years of marriage, and they still beam at each other like newlyweds. I hope dementia doesn’t take that from them. \n\n A knock rang out against Mom’s door. Her eyes widened. I rose out of my seat to grab the door. Before I could take a step, my mom’s voice pierced the air. \"No!\"\n\n The sheer surprise of my mom screaming at me was enough to get me to stop moving. She had never yelled at me before. Dad, sure, but never Mom. Mom was gentle. Her next words came softer, but still firm. \"Do not open that door.\"\n\n I heard her, and I wanted to listen, but I couldn’t move my hand away. Her voice sounded like she was speaking to me underwater. I was only a foot or two away from the door. I could feel waves of… something, some kind of pressure from outside the door pulsate into my head. \n\n Whoever was outside knocked again. More waves of pressure pushed on my head until the corners of my vision went black. I could see my hand shaking. I tried to pull away, but I couldn’t move it. I couldn’t move *anything*. \n\n\"Steve.\" My mom’s hand landed gently on my shoulder, and in a moment, everything faded and returned to normal. I gasped, realizing then I hadn’t been breathing. My heart thumped against my chest. My lungs burned. “Come sit.” I collapsed into my chair as my mom made her way back to her seat. She didn’t want to show it, but the encounter took a toll on her, too. \n\n\"Mom,\" I said when I caught my breath enough to speak. “What *was* that?” Another knock rang out, one door further down the hallway, and I flinched. I hadn’t realized how afraid I was. \n\n Mom stirred her tea and took a slow sip and a long sigh before answering. She knew the battle she was in for when she told me. \"That was Clara. ‘The Red Pine Witch,’ as everyone calls her. You probably saw her earlier. The lady with the teddy bear?\" I tried to interject, and she raised a hand. \"Just listen, Steve. Please.\" She took a moment before continuing. \"Every day shortly after three she walks around to everyone’s doors. She’ll knock, kick, and try the door handle, but as long as I lock the door, she can’t get in. She’s quite an old woman, after all. After she’s done her rounds, she goes back to her room and sleeps. And that’s it. As long as you don’t let her in, nothing happens.\"\n\n I didn’t understand. What trouble could a single old lady cause? \"Mom, what—\" she raised her hand again. \n\n\"I know what you want to say. But you felt it. I know you did.\" She was right. Something terrible had been outside that door. Something I’d never felt before. The Red Pine Witch. And my mom had felt it too. \n\n All at once, my confusion and fear exploded into rage. \"I’m getting you out of here right now.\" \n\n\"No, Steve.\" I grabbed her wrist anyway. \"No!\" A slap met my cheek, and I let go. My eyes widened. That afternoon had brought out so many things that I didn’t know existed in my mom. She had no apology in her eyes. \"Sweet Steve, I know you want to fight. You’ve always been like your father. But I can’t leave. None of us can.\" She sat me down again. I felt like a child throwing a tantrum. Mom sighed. \n\n\"I know this is hard to understand. It was hard for me too, at first. But everything will be fine, as long as I don’t let her in, and as long as I don’t leave.\"\n\n She changed the subject and refused to go back to it. I stayed and chatted for a bit until it was time for dinner, then she ushered me out of the residence. I saw Clara on my way out. She couldn’t have looked more harmless, hunched over and hobbling down the hallway, smacking her toothless gums excitedly in anticipation of her dinner. And still clutching that raggedy bear. \n\n For reasons I didn’t understand, I only waited three days to come back. I told myself various things, the things that you’re supposed to say when your mom gets old. \n\n\"I don’t know how much time I have left with her,\" or \"love and family matters most,\" stuff like that. I even told myself I was there to defend my mom, whatever that even meant. \n\n But, in truth, I was driven by some kind of morbid, primal curiosity. I *wanted* to see Clara again. I had to know what I felt that day when she knocked on my mom’s door, and I wanted to feel it again. I had forgotten all the fear I felt in those moments, like it wasn’t even real, just a dream washed away by the morning light. \n\n I understand better now. The Red Pine Witch had already seen me. Not for long, but long enough. And she didn’t want me to leave. \n\n I arrived at Sunny Smiles shortly after two. I left extra time to make sure I would be there for Clara’s nap. Clara saw me as I walked in, waving at me with her teddy bear’s arm. I waved back and walked up to the front desk. \n\n\"Who are you here to see today?\"\n\n\"Olivia Schroeder, room 160 I believe.\" She clacked away on her computer, then frowned. \n\n\"Oh, I’m sorry. It seems you just missed her.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yeah, looks like someone checked her out just a couple of hours ago.\" My heart stopped. My mom was gone. She *left.* Panic saturated my voice. \n\n\"I don’t understand. Who took her?\" I knew the answer before I finished the sentence. *Dad.* Adrenaline pumped into my veins. I raced back to the front door and into my car. Clara was still waving at me as I left. \n\n I called him the second I was on the road. *Come on… pick up*. I pressed the gas harder. It rang a few more times. My fingers gripped the wheel. Finally, I heard the line click. \n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Dad, did you check Mom out of Sunny Smiles?\"\n\n\"Well, I’m great, Steve. Thanks for asking.\"\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\"I sure as hell did.\" He sounded irritated. \"They aren’t treating her right up there. She’s not well, son. She’s coming home where she belongs.\"\n\n\"Dad, listen to me. Take her back right now.\" \n\n\"And just why should I do that?\" I stumbled for words, not sure how to communicate to my rational, atheist father about the demonic witch in a way that might actually convince him. \n\n\"It’s not safe for her.\" \n\n\"Oh, Jesus, not you too.\" He knew. He knew, and he didn’t believe it. \n\n\"Dad, listen to me. I know it sounds crazy. It sounded crazy to me too, but—\"\n\n\"But nothing. She’s coming home, and she’s gonna get these crazy ideas out of her head. Can you imagine the nerve telling stories like that to a lady with dementia?” I could hear mom yelling in the background. *Goddamn it, Dad.* \n\n\"Dad—\"\n\n\"Enough. I’ve heard enough. She’s my wife. This isn’t up for discussion.\" The line clicked. *Fuck.* I glanced at the clock on my dash. 2:24. Just over half an hour until Clara takes her nap. I knew I wouldn’t make it in time, but I had to try.\n\n I made it to my dad’s house at 3:07 pm. I pushed the key into the lock and slammed the door open, not knowing if I was already too late. My parents were in the living room, my mom sitting on the couch, and my dad standing a few feet away. My mom screamed when I came in. \n\n\"Steve? Goddamn it, I told you—\" I ignored him and walked over to my mom, grabbing her wrist. \n\n\"Come on, mom, I’m taking you back.\" I’d never seen her so visibly scared. \n\n\"Steve—\" she said. \n\n\"The hell you are.\" My dad said. I turned to face him directly. \n\n\"Try and stop me.\" I almost couldn’t believe the words left my mouth. \n\n\"Steve!\" Mom said again, but Dad and I were too involved in our pissing contest to listen. Dad balled his fist. For a moment, I thought my dad might actually swing at me. Then I felt it. Waves of pressure pulsating into my body. Exactly like last time. But unlike last time, it was at least twice as strong. It shot pain into my brain stronger than any migraine I had ever had. \n\n Dad felt it too. I could tell. He stopped yelling. His eyes widened. \n\n\"Steve!\" Mom yelled again. Her voice sounded muffled and distant. \"Steve! The door!\"\n\n I wheeled around. In my anger, I had left the front door *wide open*. I tried to make my way towards it, but I could hardly move, just like before. My legs shook. I pushed hard and managed a few steps, but I was still at least fifteen feet away. A sharp, piercing noise penetrated my ears as I got closer. My vision was going black once more. I kept my eyes focused on the doorknob. Just a few more feet. Finally, I was within range. I dove for the door, pushing it closed as I fell to the floor. \n\n The instant the door shut, all the pressure and pain dissolved. I gasped for air. My lungs burned. I sat up, resting my back against the door, and looked at my mom. \"Are you okay?\" She nodded. \n\n Dad had disappeared. I found my footing and locked the door before walking over to my mom. \n\n\"I think we need to go before dad gets back.\" To my surprise, she shook her head. \n\n\"It’s too late. She’s already here.\" Not a moment later, a pair of knocks sounded against the front door. \n\n *Bang, bang.* \n\n The door handle squealed as Clara tried to turn the knob. I’d never been less certain I locked something in my life. The handle jiggled again and Clara turned the knob back and forth. Unable to get in, she banged the door twice more, louder this time. \n\n *Bang, bang.* \n\n This time, there was another sound. A shotgun being cocked. I wheeled around. \n\n\"Dad—\" He had the barrel of the weapon planted into my chest before I could say another word. I raised my hands. \n\n\"I’ve had enough of this,\" he said. I sat back slowly onto the couch next to mom. He turned towards the front door. \n\n\"Dad, please don’t, you had to have felt—\" but it was too late. He flicked the lock undone and opened the door, pointing the gun outside. I held my breath and squeezed my mom’s hand. \n\n The moment the door opened, a chill ran through the room. The sound of Clara’s bare feet slapping the hardwood floor by the front door rang out. She plodded right past my dad, who didn’t move a muscle, still pointing his gun out the front door. \n\n She stared at my mom. I wanted to get up, to put myself between her and my mom, to do anything, but it was useless. She had frozen me to the couch. \n\n\"No!\" My dad had turned the gun towards her. Clara didn’t break her eyes away from my mom as she flicked a single finger into the air. My dad’s eyes widened for a moment as he drew the barrel of his own gun into the bottom of his jaw and fired. \n\n My mom screamed. Clara continued her march towards us. I still couldn’t move. Tears streamed down my face as I watched pieces of my dad’s brain drip down the wall behind his body. Clara reached my mom, bending forward and grazing her cheek with a finger. \n\n A moment later, mom floated into the air. Her face contorted in a way I had never seen before. Utterly consumed by terror and helplessness. A red glow filled the room. I heard my mom scream. And then she was gone. Vanished into the air. \n\n The Red Pine Witch didn’t look at me even once as she left. She simply turned and walked out, still holding that old, raggedy [bear.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldArchitect/comments/yv369y/thanks_for_being_here/)",

        "text": " \n\n**This is a post for those who can't sleep get enough sleep at night!**\n\nThis post is for those of you who, like me, simply can't “just go to sleep” but end up lying in bed wide awake for hours not knowing why. For the most part, my lack of sleep was due to my insomnia and stress but many times throughout the years I couldn't sleep for unexplained reasons. I have tried every method, ingredient, exercise and practice to help me get some sleep so I wanted to share some of the ones that worked best for me for people who are in a similar position to how I was. \n\nMy mind would race with thoughts about work, exams and other things, and I found it difficult to unwind and relax until I discovered these methods. \n\n**Real Meditation:**\n\nOne day, a friend suggested that i try meditation to help me relax and quiet my mind before bed. At first i was very sceptical. And after putting it off for weeks I eventually tried it. I had never meditated before, and I wasn't sure how it could help me with my sleep issues. But I decided to give it a try. I started meditating a few minutes before bed each night. At first, it was difficult to focus and my mind would wander, but I persisted and after a few weeks of meditating regularly, I began noticing a big difference in my sleep. I was falling asleep faster and sleeping more soundly throughout the night. I also felt more rested and refreshed in the morning. As i continued to meditate, I found that it not only helped me with my sleep but also with my overall mental health and wellbeing. I felt more relaxed and centered throughout the day, and I was better able to handle stress and anxiety. \n\n**SoundSnooze Sleep Mask.** \n\nThis was one I stumbled across on Instagram when I began meditating, it looked like a really good idea and had a decent amount of positive reviews, I was a little concerned at first but ordered it anyway just to test it out and I haven't stopped using it since it arrived, i really have to give credit to this sleep mask for helping me get my sleeping pattern sorted because it really helped me improve my meditation and pretty much blocked out all the thoughts racing through my head before bed, I personally liked to play ambient and nature sounds before going to sleep which helps me alot, I even buy these as present for friends and family. Would really recommend this for those who have tried all other methods to sleep and nothing seems to be working. Really a worthwhile purchase, can get it at [https://soundsnooze.com/](https://soundsnooze.com/) \n\n**Healthy Diet:**\n\nI also decided to take a closer look at my diet and heard that certain foods can have an impact on sleep quality, and I realized that eating habits were not as healthy as they could be. I made a commitment to eating a mor balanced diet, with plenty of fruits, veg and whole grains and it made a massive difference, however, I will not go into major detail as many people know that this is a given, eat healthy for a healthy amount of sleep. Cant stress this enough.",

        "text": " \n\nMy name is Elijah Miller, I am 36 years old. What I am about to share with you is something that happened when I was 15. I haven’t spoken to anyone about this but my therapist, Mr. Evans, who I have been seeing for  about two years. I just recently told him about this experience and he thought that I might feel better if I tell other people about it.  \n My family and I lived in a house inside of a culdesac, when I was 12 until I was 16. There were six houses inside of it and we had a few neighbors. One of the neighbors there was another boy, the same age as me, named Todd.\n\nTodd was a very adventurous kid. He always liked to go on hikes with me in the woods near our house. Even though I was hesitant most of the time at first, I would go with him and we would have a blast. Despite him being very extroverted and an adventurous kid while I was pretty introverted; we were great friends. \n\nI forgot to mention, one of the houses between ours was an old, creepy, vacant house. I will admit it always creeped me out, but at the same time having a creepy abandoned house right next to where I lived was kind of cool to me.  \n Once we were hanging out in his backyard at an odd hour of the night when he got an idea. “Hey, y’know that house over there?” He pointed in the direction of the abandoned house. Despite him not pointing directly at it and only in the general direction; I immediately knew what he was talking about.\n\n“Yeah, what about it?” I asked him. \n\n“I’ve always wondered what’s in there…” He said with curiosity.\n\n“I actually have, too.” I began to focus my gaze onto the house. It had always been something that piqued my curiosity. \n\nTodd turned towards me smirking, he said, “Well, there’s only one way to find out, Y’know.” It honestly shocked me that it took him that long to suggest going into that house. \n\n“Are you sure? What if we get seen? Someone might call the cops!” I said quietly. \n\n“Oh, come on. We’ll be fine. No one will know.” \n\n*Are you sure?* I thought to myself. *Well, We never have had anything bad happen to us when I go on his little adventures.* I thought about it pretty hard for a second. And then I smiled, “Alright, fine. But if the cops get called, don't get mad at me!”  \n “Yes!” He exclaimed in a whisper. “But, can I tell Andrew?” He asked.\n\n   I cringed to myself. I was never very fond of Andrew but he and Todd were friends.  \n “Ugh… I guess. As long as you tell him to tell no one.” And after I said that we were on our merry way before I knew it. As we were walking to the house I got a feeling. A bad feeling. I started to feel an overwhelming sense of dread. I started sweating as my stomach felt like it was sinking, my muscles tensed, my mind went blank, my heart started pounding, and I started hyperventilating. I always would have anxiety when I would go on these adventures with him, but this… This was not that. I felt terrified.  \n “Dude, Are you okay?” I guess he had noticed that I was acting off.  \n “Huh? Oh! No No No, I…I’m fine!” I lied to him. He looked at me, puzzled.  \n “Uh, you sure as hell don’t look fine!”  \n “Trust me I’m fine, haha!” I kept insisting on the lie; something I regret doing to this day.  \n “Dude, we can do this tomorrow I-”  \n “It’s fine!” I cut him off.  \n “Ok, then…” He walked forward and I followed him. I could tell that he was uncomfortable because of how I was acting. Shortly we got to the house and all the negative feelings were gone. We were on the front porch and he turned the doorknob. It was locked.\n\nI chuckled, “Why am I unsurprised?” I said. He looked back at me.  \n “I guess we’ll have to do this the fun way,” he smirked and started walking around the house into the backyard. I followed behind him. He looked up at the house towards a window and smiled smugly. I watched him looking around the ground for something.  \n “Aha! There!” He picked up a large rock and held it as if he were about to throw it through the window before he stopped. “Why don’t you do the honors, Eli?”  \n “Oh, you want me to do it?”  \n He nodded his head. “Yes.”  \n “Alright…” I took the rock from his hand and threw it at the window. The glass shattered into tiny shards that looked like crystals as the rock flew through it.  \n “Nice…” Todd said with satisfaction in his voice. He then proceeded to put his arm through the opening to unlock it. It made a subtle but audible click as it unlocked. Todd struggled to lift the now unlocked window but succeeded. He gazed inside for a few seconds before turning to me and grinning, “Ladies first.” I could tell by the tone of his voice that he was just trying to make me laugh but I didn’t find it very funny. I climbed through the small rectangular shaped hole and fell onto the ground as I got through.  \n “Ow!” I cried out to myself. “Ok, Todd. Now it’s your turn.” I said to him. He put his arms into the window and I pulled him in.  \n “Oh my god, Eli! You’re bleeding!” He pointed at my forearm. The underside had a small cut on it and a tiny amount of blood was seeping out.\n\n*I probably cut myself while falling onto some glass.* I thought to myself, “Eh, I’ll be fine.” We began to wander around the room. As I looked around I saw an old fridge and a rusty stovetop, “This must’ve been the kitchen.” I quietly said to myself.  \n “Yeah, it would’ve taken a genius to find that out.” He chuckled to himself.  \n I giggled, “Thanks for the compliment. I know I’m a genius,” I snarkily said back to him.  \n “I’ll race you into that room!” He pointed towards a doorway to another room. He started running into the room and I quickly followed behind him. The walls were painted dark green. There was a couch and a fireplace. The sofa had several rips and was covered in dirt and stains. There was something on the shelf above the fireplace but it was dark so I couldn't see very well. They looked like dolls of some sorts.\n\n“Do you see that?” I asked Todd.  \n “Yeah, what are those? They look like action figures or something.” He said curiously, “Hang on, I have a crank flashlight.”  \n “Wait what? Then why haven’t you been using it?”  \n “Well, I figured we didn’t need it! We can see pretty well in the dark.” He said, “Just not whatever these are.” He pulled a flashlight out of his pocket and cranked it. The light it provided was dim but it gave off enough that we could see what the things on the shelf were. I gasped as I realized that they were all taxidermied squirrels, “Oh my god. Well, maybe the person who lived here had a hobby?” He said while questioning his own statement.  \n “Yeah, l-let’s just leave it at that.” I replied back to him. I have never thought that taxidermy was inherently creepy, but those stuffed squirrels freaked me out and still do when I think about them, “Maybe we should leave.”  \n “I mean, it’s kind of strange but it’s not really dangerous though.” He was right. I started looking around again and found a door. The door was white and matched with the wall’s paint. I put my hand on the brass doorknob and turned it. As soon as the door opened I was hit with a smell. A rotting stench. I nearly gagged from the smell but kept looking around the room. It was a small bathroom with chipping grey paint on the walls and cracked marble tiles. But what terrified me was what was in the bathtub. The bathtub was full of dozens of squirrel carcasses. There were several brown splotches of old blood scattered on the tub. I’m no expert on the decomposition of small animals but the squirrels did not look like they had been there for that long at all. I gasped loudly at the sight and felt like throwing up.   \n “T-Todd, there’s a bunch of dead squirrels!”  \n I heard his voice call back to me from another room, “Where on Earth did you find that?”  \n “J-Just come here, y-you idiot!”   \n His voice got closer as he walked in my direction, “I don’t believe y-” He covered his mouth with his hands in shock.  \n  I turned to him and shouted, “Do you believe me now?!”  \n “I wish I didn’t.” His voice was shaky, “We need to get out of here, now!”  \n “On it, boss!” I replied back. I grabbed Todd’s hand and started running towards the kitchen. He stumbled but also started running with me. I got to the window but noticed something. There was someone in the backyard. I couldn’t make out any details but he was really tall. He looked like he was around 6’5”. I immediately froze. *What if it’s a cop?* I thought to myself before realizing that it was not. He was dragging something. I couldn’t tell what it was but I was sure that it was a large carcass of some sort. *That’s the guy who stuffed those squirrels!* I made a disturbing realization as I noticed this, “Todd, we gotta hide!” I whispered to him  \n “Ok.” he whispered back. We quietly ran up the stairs and into a room. The walls were yellow and there was a bed with red sheets. But to the right of the bed there was a workbench covered in several tools, unlit wax candles, Squirrel carcasses, a squirrel anatomy book, and the most disturbing of all, a human anatomy book. I realized that whoever this was must've been planning to stuff a person. My heart dropped. *The thing he was dragging was a human being!* I thought to myself. Todd shuddered while looking at the workbench.  \n “Hide!” Todd whispered as he heard footsteps coming up the stairs. We ran into a closet with pinewood shutter doors. We quietly shut them. We sat next to each other and waited in the closet for what felt like twenty minutes but was probably only twenty seconds as the footsteps creeped closer and closer. Then they stopped in front of the door to the room we were in.  \n *Please don’t come in! Please don’t come in!* But right as those thoughts passed through my mind, the door creaked open. I could barely see through the shutter but the same tall figure that I saw in the backyard entered into the room dragging the corpse behind him. The body scraped against the ground as he slowly walked into the room towards the workbench. He reached the table and let go of the body's leg. Its foot made a thud against the ground. He proceeded to light the candles providing enough light for me to be able to see. The body he was dragging was a woman. A woman who I recognized but wasn’t sure where from. Her mouth hung open lifelessly and she had a small head wound which looked like she was hit with a blunt object that was seeping out blood. The man who was dragging her had long disheveled brown hair, a ripped plain white tee, and loose, dirty khaki pants. The demented man looked to be in his late thirties to early forties. He picked up the woman’s corpse and laid her out on the workbench. I almost hurled when I realized what he was about to do. I felt sick to my stomach and started gagging. I guess I was being too loud because as soon as I did he turned towards the closet that we were in. He started slowly walking towards us while smiling like a maniac and cackling. I started sobbing and reflecting on my entire life feeling so certain that I was going to die there.  \n “Lord, please save us.” Todd whispered. I had never heard Todd pray in my life and I know that he was an atheist. As the man inched closer he put his hand on the door to the closet and slid it open. He stared at us for at least a second before I went into fight or flight mode. I immediately chose flight, crawling past him before getting up and running faster than I even knew I could. I reached the open window and squeezed through it, caught myself as I hit the ground and immediately got back on my feet. I ran and ran faster than any Olympic champion and never looked back. I swear I heard rapid footsteps behind me. I prayed to God that it was Todd behind me but I wasn’t sure. I reached my house and that was when I finally turned around and… There was no one behind me. There weren’t even footsteps in the grass. There was no trace of Todd following me or that man chasing me. But that didn’t stop me from going inside my house as fast as I could so I could get to the house phone to call 911. I called the cops and immediately told them everything that happened but they didn’t believe me. They didn’t even try to listen to me. They just told me not to prank call the police and hung up. I felt like crying and throwing up at the same time. I felt like I left Todd for dead but that I was lucky I had survived at the same time.  \n To this day I still haven’t seen Todd since the incident and know that he must’ve become part of that man’s sick collection. This wasn’t just someone with an innocent taxidermy hobby, this was a dangerously sick and deranged person. That man might still be out there claiming more victims and stuffing them for his own liking. To this day I still blame myself. The feeling I had outside the house makes sense and I know I should have trusted it. I still feel like it’s my fault that Todd is gone and that I abandoned him.  \n So, yeah… That was my experience with The House in the Culdesac.",

        "text": "  \n\nThere’s really nothing special about my town at all. Just another sleepy little factory town among the dozens scattered between the rows of endless corn and soybeans in the Ohio valley. Once upon a time it was a happy, dozy little place. Kids ran around the neighborhoods while their parents worked in the factory. Everyone had enough money to live comfortably. Old folk retired and sat on their porches, neighbors helped each other out when it was needed, and everyone’s doors were unlocked, but there were downsides too. I guess we should’ve seen them coming, but hindsight’s’ always 20/20 right? \n\nFactory work leads to back and knee pain, which leads to Percocet prescriptions. Then the factories started shutting down. Which led to poverty, poverty and Percocet prescriptions created a perfect breeding ground for heroin. Which in turn led to a perfect breeding ground for crime, and one day kids stopped playing outside. Folks stopped talking to each other, Doors stayed locked, and people became leery of their neighbors. \n\nBut still, nothing special about that. From here to the old Coal towns of West Virginia, to the Farm towns in Indiana it was the same song and dance. Small towns were dying, and most death is slow and ugly. Our little town was no exception to the changing tides. I really started noticing the struggle around 2010.\n\nI guess that’s when we all started noticing “Knock-Knock” too.\n\nBelieve it or not Small towns have a homeless population just like big cities do. It’s not as vast. There are no giant ramshackle camps off of railroad tracks, no Skid rows or anything like that, but we got them. They hang out at the twenty four hour gas stations after hours. Sleep in tents under bridges if they can’t find a motel or a shelter to lay their heads down at night. They wander up and down the main drags in the same clothes with the same defeated looks on their faces. I guess in a way it’s worse in the small towns than in the big cities. The saying about every small town is that “Everybody knows everybody.” \n\nAnd that’s no lie. That homeless women you see shambling around main street at eleven in the evening used to babysit you when you were a kid. Her mom goes to your church, her kids go to school with you. It really puts a whole new level of sad reality onto the forlorn faces of homeless people you see in these small towns. It’s a sad thing to witness. \n\nFor everyone except “Knock Knock” of course.\n\nNo one recognized him. No one knows who he is, where he came from, why he’s homeless. Not even the other homeless folk. As a matter of fact they actually tend to go out of their way to stay away from him. I guess everyone does now, but at first, we noticed it with them. If he was on one side of a street they were quick to find their way to the other side of the street. They didn’t talk to him, or even look at him. Some of the younger more volatile ones would even treat him with hostility. You’d see them pointing off in a different direction while shouting at him while he just did that crazy little laugh he always did. \n\nHe was one ugly fucking fish. No nice way to say that. Big guy with uncombed hair and a scraggly beard. He had two lazy eyes that kind of went off in opposite directions at all times that seemed even more separated by the huge scar he had in the middle of his face. Like the one’s you’d see on the old lumberjacks that weren’t careful with their chainsaws. He wore the same clothes every single day. Which I guess in retrospect isn’t too surprising. It was more of the outfit that he’d chosen to live in that constantly raised an eyebrow. \n\nHe wore this huge trench coat. Even in the summer. Torn jeans and these big ratty boots that seemed to accentuate the limp he had in his stride. Visible dirt was always on his face. I don’t think he ever showered. Not even creek or fountain baths, both of which were more than possible. He just kind of chooses not to. I’d be a liar if I’d said his demeanor wasn’t unsettling, but what was even more unsettling was that fucking laugh. \n\nHe was always laughing. Constantly, sometimes it’d be a low and awkward sounding chuckle, and sometimes it would be this maniacal incessant bellowing of laughter. You’d be woken up at three in the morning to the sound of “knock knock” going down your street laughing at the stars. No nice way to say it, dude was as creepy as they get. \n\nInitially though we had no idea just how creepy things would get. \n\nHe got his nickname around 2012, 2013 maybe. It was late in the evening and John Pershing had just put his kids to bed when he got a knock on the door. \n\nHe opened it to see “Knock Knock.” His crazy laugh in that steady low chuckle. In his hand were three big round point shovels that he’d obviously stolen out of someone’s garage, maybe multiple someone’s. Who knows? They were never returned. Before John can say anything “Knock Knock” just hands him these three shovels, turns around and saunters off. Laughing that mad laugh of his until he was out of sight.\n\nJohn was perplexed, and a little unsettled of course. Who wouldn’t be? But ultimately, he just chalked it up to crazy homeless people being crazy. He put the shovels in his garage, told himself he’d file a police report tomorrow after work, and try and get these shovels back to their rightful owners. What more could John do other than just kind of forget about it? \n\nJohn was a welder by trade, and a damn good one. I remember him showing me the wood burning furnace he’d made and installed in his house. How he bragged about all the money he saved on his gas bill, and how it kept the house so much warmer than your standard central heating ever could. I would be a liar if I said it wasn’t an impressive project, and he was right. The house was a lot warmer than mine was for sure.\n\nBut I guess even the most masterful craftsmen make mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes are big ones. \n\nPoor John. He was just about to finish up his shift for the day when he got the phone call from his neighbors. Sometime in the course of the day his house had caught fire, and by the time the fire department got called and made it out to his place the entire house was up in flames. I’ll never forget the sound that John Made when he pulled up to his completely engulfed house and realized that his daughters weren’t outside with the other neighbors. \n\nStacy, Lydia, and Malorie. All three of them were younger than fifteen. They were good kids. No one knows why they couldn’t make it out of the house. The coroner’s best guess is that because the fire started in Johns Furnace in the basement. It caused a whole lot of smoke to pour through the ducts and into the house. Poor kids probably succumbed to asphyxiation before they even knew that there was a fire. \n\nJohn was never the same after that. How could he have been? Having to bury one child would be enough to break a man, but three? And having to bury them because something you created killed them? To lose your entire house and life on top of all that? I could never even begin to imagine. We did what we could for John, but in our hearts we kind of knew it was pointless. He killed himself a few years later. \n\nA couple weeks later Nancy Palmer got a knock on her door. Same time. There was “Knock Knock.” Those crazy eyes and that wild laugh. He handed her an empty bottle of Aspirin and took off into the night. Nancy was a little more concerned than John had been though. She called the police immediately, but ultimately there’s nothing illegal about handing someone a bottle of over the counter medication, and even if there was no one had the slightest clue where “Knock Knock” slept at night. It was a lost cause.\n\nNancy’s daughter discovered her mother dead on the kitchen floor some two days later. Heart attack. Sitting on the counter was a spilled bottle of Aspirin she must’ve tried to take before she collapsed. \n\nJust a little while after that Kurt Masters got a similar pounding on his door. “Knock Knock” handed him a ragged life jacket he’d probably pulled out of dumpster. Laughing that laugh of his the whole time before leaving Kurt standing on his porch completely unsettled and bewildered. \n\nIt took the police awhile to find Kurt after he went missing. It was ultimately a group of fishermen that found his body stuck in a pile of lilies in our local fishing pond. Best guess is that he slipped off of his boat and hit his head on some rocks in the fairly shallow waters and drowned. \n\nSmall towns have small ears, and small ears have small mouths. It didn’t take too many more of these random deaths for the residents of our town to start putting two and two together. When “Knock Knock” visited your house. Bad things were soon to follow. \n\nPeople started speculating, thinking that “Knock Kock” was somehow killing these people. That he was dropping these crazy and vague clues to indicate just exactly how he was going to do it, and then making it come to fruition by his own hands, but it didn’t take too much thinking to conclude just how impossible that was. How do you knowingly give someone a heart attack? How do follow someone three miles outside of town on foot, climb into their boat and push them overboard? With a limp on top of that. It just wasn’t possible. \n\nIt was after Jared Cash fell into the molten glass reservoir after “Knock Knock” handed him an old ice pack not two days prior that we really started to suspect something that honestly might’ve been more impossible. \n\nSomehow, someway “Knock Knock” was predicting our futures. Seeing our deaths. Like some sort of fucked up nonverbal harbinger. At first, we laughed that off. I mean why would we? That’s crazy.\n\nBut then Kaitlyn Althouse Got hit and killed by a drunk driver after being gifted an empty bottle of Kamchatka.\n\nTyler Flora Was crushed by a tractor after receiving a toy Dollar Tree John Deere mower.\n\nLevi Riley was mauled by a stray dog while out hunting after “Knock Knock” handed him a dog collar.\n\nThe police decided to launch an investigation, and after talking to a few of the homeless residents it was discovered that “Knock Knock” had been associated with random deaths way longer than initially thought. He would hand Junkies old syringes, and days later they’d be found Overdosed. The reason the other homeless stayed away from “Knock Knock” wasn’t just because of his unsettling looks. People who spent any amount of time at all around “Knock Knock” were sure to die. \n\nIt wasn’t long before Wanted posters started posting up all over town. Of course he wasn’t in any database, and no actual picture of him could be found anywhere so they were all artists’ renditions, but still. I guess when you’re so distinctly unsettling it’s hard to miss your features. The drawings were spot on. \n\nThe police looked everywhere for “Knock Knock.”. Nothing, nothing at all. It’s like he just appeared and disappeared whenever he brought these crazy omens with him. You’d think something would’ve caught him. An eyewitness reports. CCTV catching him dumpster diving for these horrible talismans, but it’s like he just . . . Didn’t exist until he did.\n\nThe whole town stayed hidden, no one opened their doors for anything. Especially after dark. It didn’t matter though. He’d simply leave the object on the porch to be discovered in the morning. Everyone knew that it was him because they’d hear that incessant, endless laughter outside of their doors. \n\nIt was last night when I got the knock on my door. . . \n\nI didn’t answer it, of course. Who would be dumb enough to do that at this point? \n\nTo try and be safe I didn’t even leave my house for two days after “Knock Knocks” visit. Thinking that somehow that would make it all less real. That if I didn’t see whatever it was for long enough then I’d be able to dodge the omen gifted to me. \n\nBut eventually I had to leave . . . You can’t just hide in your house all day every day after all. Even if you think your life depends on it. There’s only so long you can realistically go without having to buy groceries. Or having to go to work, get your mail. \n\nAs I opened the door sitting right in the middle of my porch in plain sight was a handful of rusted nails, tied neatly together with a rubber band . . .\n\nI don’t know how, I don’t know when, but no one. Not a single person in my town has been able to escape “Knock Knocks” prophecies. No matter how careful they’ve been. As I’m sitting here typing this it’s like I can almost hear that wild laughter just outside my window. Cackling at my pathetic attempts to dodge my inevitable future. \n\nGive me prayers, give me good thoughts, give me some kind of way out of this. I don’t want to die. . . But I know a pattern when I see one, and when he knocks on your door your days are short. . .",

        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/111m676 Previous: https://redd.it/11jhga3 )\n(Suicide TW )\n\nJackalope was forced to stay home to rest for a few days after his body rejected his new arm. He needed help changing his bandages every morning, which I agreed to help. I put up his hair first, then went into the process of removing the day-old bandage to apply the new wrappings. \n\n“You really don’t need to go through this.” Jackalope said the first morning. \n\nHe was a bit embarrassed when I saw him without his shirt on. Aside from his scarred and raw shoulder, he had an old scar on his chest. It looked like an autopsy scar. I didn't ask him about it because I could tell it would be a touchy subject. \n\n“Don’t worry about it. I took care of my mother for three months before the end. This is nothing. What happened to your wrist?” I asked to try and change the subject. \n\nHe’d been wearing a wrist brace since he arrived home from the clinic. Robin didn’t mention Jackalope hurt his wrist or asked me to look after it. He glanced down and shook his head. \n\n“It’s an old injury still healing.” He refused to say more. \n\nThe silence between us felt like a burden. The smell of medicine and wrapping bandages made me think back to when my mother was sick. She was more comfortable at home. We hired some nurses, but I mostly did the work. She refused to show how much pain she was in as she got thinner and thinner. I wondered why she got sick. It just didn’t seem fair. My mother volunteered with so many different organizations. That woman acted like a saint and yet she died so young. \n\nMy father also died too soon. The boy who shot him was just a confused kid. I wanted to hate him for making a mistake that took my father away, and yet I couldn’t. I didn’t keep track of what he was doing now. I think my father's killer regretted what he’d done and then cleaned up his life after he did his time. Even someone like him had done more for the world than me. \n\n“What was your mother like?” Jackalope asked, his voice snapping me from my thoughts. \n\nHe didn’t have a family, so he liked hearing about mine. Telling him stories passed the time we were both under house arrest to recover. \n\nBy the second day, his shoulder healed up a great deal. Wet still stuck to the new morning routine of his hair being put up and shoulder treated. I caught his expression in the bathroom mirror one morning. He wanted to ask a question but wasn’t sure how to say it. I pressed him until he let it spill. \n\n“Are you... not going to shave this morning?” He asked slowly as if walking over a minefield. \n\nMy heart nearly stopped. For a second I thought he knew the reason why I threw away the razors in the house. It soon became clear what was really bothering him. \n\n“I'm trying out a new look.” I lied. \n\nHe made a face as if there was a bad taste in his mouth. My roommate was far too kind to come right out to say what he really thought. He just let out a small noise of disagreement and then looked away. I should be insulted. I just let the conversation die. \n\nAfter the razor incident, I started taking over-the-counter sleeping medicine. So far, they have worked. I hadn’t come across any figures in the dark or woken up in the middle of the night. But I started to get stressed out over taking them for too long. I worried that Jackalope would be targeted if I didn’t take the burden of the God’s attention until we found a way to get rid of him for good. \n\nBy the time Jackalope recovered, I had a job waiting in my email. I never let him know about my sore shoulder, so he let me accept the work. I would be working with Fera, which made him feel better. I headed out promising to call if I wouldn’t be home by dinner. \n\nI arrived in front of a fairly normal house in the middle of a pristine neighborhood. Fera waited out front. Her beads were a bright blue that matched her tie that day. She made a face the moment her eyes landed on me. \n\n“What is that thing on your face?” She asked, refusing to take a step closer. \n\n“You don’t like my mustache?” I replied trying to act offended. \n\n“I don’t know what that thing is, but it isn’t a mustache. I feel sorry that Jackalope wakes up next to that.” \n\n“We’re roommates.” I corrected again. \n\nI really didn’t know where everyone was getting these ideas from. It’s not as if I acted like I made a move on my roommate. Just because we lived together didn’t mean we were also dating. At this point, I think Fera was just joking around to annoy me. And it worked. \n\nI started to walk closer to the house, but her face turned serious. She stepped in front blocking my way. \n\n“It’s pretty bad in there. I think you would be able to handle a body that got torn apart better than this. I don’t want you to do this case if you don’t think you’re ready for it.” She told me in a concerned voice. \n\nI’d been called to document a suicide. There had been an increase in them in the area. The Corporation hired humans that were aware of the supernatural to look over suspect events to decide if an Agent needed to be dispatched to the area. The human they hired also ended his life causing The Corporation to assume there was some sort of other force at work. The current death was a middle-aged man who didn’t seem to have any reason to end his life. At least his family didn’t think so. \n\nFera knew about how rough the past few months had been for me. I was glad she worried enough about my mental state to double-check if I would be alright dealing with such a case. \n\n“I’ll be fine. I’ve done scenes like this before.” I told her. \n\nShe wasn’t entirely convinced. She let me walk by her and into the house while staying close behind. We walked to the upstairs bedroom where the scene waited. A heavy air fell over us. Other than talking about the case and gathering details I needed to document, we didn't speak. Fera gave this job all the respect it deserved. \n\nI paused in my work to look at the body slumped against the wall. The gun landed off to the side. I needed to bag it but wanted Fera to do so. She needed practice. I suddenly didn’t want to be near the weapon, let alone touch it. Soon I didn’t have a choice. Her cell phone rang making her huff out into the hallway to take the call.  \n\nIn a few minutes, she poked her head back inside. \n\n“I’m needed for a job. How about you head home and let someone else finish up?” She offered. \n\nI shook my head. I didn’t have much left to do. I wasn’t going to leave a few details to someone else.  \n\n“I can finish up here. You can go.” I said. \n\nShe gave me a long look, clearly not wanting to leave. Her phone rang again showing she really was needed elsewhere. With a sigh, she turned away and made me promise to call her or someone else if I needed help or wanted to leave early. I got back to work after she left wanting to finish this scene by dinner. \n\nI worked for another two hours on my own. The body my only company. I’ve never had any issues being around the dead before. For some reason, being alone in a room with a man who took his own life started to get to me. I noticed my hand shaking slightly as I made notes. I thought I sensed eyes on my back but ignored it. I didn’t see anyone so wanted to blame that feeling on nerves. \n\nThe feeling grew the longer I stayed in that room. The tension was so thick it started to hurt my chest. \n\n“I know you’re here.” I said out loud, breaking the silence. \n\nA set of footsteps came from the doorway. Someone stopped in the doorway to rest a shoulder against the frame. Arms crossed, and a smug smile on his face. He looked like Jackalope, but how he looked when I first met him. Without the scars on his face, and both arms. The way he should be if we never met. \n\n“Are you the one who killed this man?” I pressed. \n\nI was stressed seeing this person. I didn’t have any idea what kind of creature he might be. He didn’t feel like the Dark God I’d been dealing with. The lights flickered leaving us in darkness for a few seconds. The only source of light came from the hallway.  \n\n“I didn’t do anything besides talk with him.” The creature spoke. \n\nHe didn’t really sound like my roommate. He tried, but there was something too smug about his voice. My hand hovered over my pocket wondering if I should call for backup. If I did, this creature could kill me and leave. Or could get away before help arrived. I needed to keep him here until Fera came back. Or deal with him myself. \n\n“You must have done something more. This man had people who loved him and a support system.” I said and glanced over at the body. \n\nFrom everything I’d seen so far, if this man was struggling, he had options. And yet he was dead on his office floor. If things were this bad, why didn’t he go to his family or loved ones? What did this creature do that pushed him over the edge? \n\n“Loved ones? Like how your father loved you?” The creature said, a wide smile appearing on his face. \n\nMy stomach twisted in such an intense bout of guilt it nearly forced me to my knees. This creature must have some sort of power to increase the negative feelings a person may have. I hadn’t felt this bad since the funeral. I shook my head determined to not let him get to me. \n\n“He has nothing to do with all of this.” I replied, but my voice turned weak. \n\n“I think he does. He became a cop because he wanted to protect his son, didn’t he? He could have become a lawyer making all sorts of money but no. You were nearly taken as a toddler, and he decided he wanted to protect others.” The creature pressed causing me to think of long-forgotten memories. \n\nThere was an incident I was too young to remember. While at the mall, a man scooped me up and almost got away. My father caught up to him and nearly beat him to death. Afterwards, he found it hard to go out in public with his small son. To ease his fears, he shifted his career path to being a cop. He felt proud of the work he was doing. He died young simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I often wondered if I hadn’t been around, my father might be still alive. Or if I didn’t wander off that day. \n\n“His death was an accident.” I said, voice shaking. \n\nI never blamed the person who killed him because I took all the responsibility myself. The feeling of guilt and stress started to build up to an almost unbearable level no matter how hard I tried to push it down. \n\n“And your poor mother. She slaved away in that factory to feed her little boy. Now, remind me again what she did. Grinded away some sort of galvanized steel? Doesn’t that cause cancer?” \n\nThe words hurt harder than a punch to the face. A grimace fell over my face as the memories of how my mother looked when she got sick came back. I shook my head trying to get a grip on myself. In the back of my mind, I blamed myself for her death. Somehow, I found a way to blame myself for cancer. \n\nI caught myself going down a dark train of thought. These were just words. Just thoughts. And yet, my lungs started to close. I suddenly couldn’t get enough air. I started to gasp while on my knees. \n\nThe creature wearing my friend’s face didn’t move. That grin said all it needed to. The feeling of fear and dread those thoughts caused made my vision swim. I needed to get away, to call someone to come by and help. \n\nMy breathing came fast and short. My hands shook almost too much to pull out my cell phone. My shoulders became so tense it hurt. I hovered a thumb over the dial icon, but my finger refused to move.  \n\n“Now, who are you calling? Fera? Isn't she busy? Wouldn’t her coming over here to save you cause yet another death? How many people have you killed? Your parents. Little Agent Six.” The creature said and suddenly was sitting in front of me. \n\n“I didn’t...” I started but the stress became too overwhelming to speak. \n\nMy words died in my throat. This monster was just saying what I’ve kept to myself for years. I knew this is how it got under people’s skin. The power he held caused my emotions to go haywire. No matter how logically I looked at the situation, it didn’t stop how I started to feel. My body started shutting down from the stress. My chest hurt so badly that I thought I was having a heart attack. My vision became blurry, and I dropped my phone unable to stomach holding it. \n\nThe creature reached over to pick up the phone. His face changed slowly revealing what it really looked like. Something twisted and ugly under the mask it wore. \n\n“Do you want to call your roommate? He would come here to try and save you. But I could talk with him as well. You don’t want that, do you?” \n\nI shook my head as if that would remove all my discomfort. If I called someone for help now, I was convinced they would die. No, I needed to save myself. And yet, my brain refused to think of anything useful. I sharp pain came across my chest causing me to clutch the front of my shirt. It forced me to press my forehead against the ground with tears threatening to start. \n\n“They all loved you. And that was their downfall.” The monster said, the voice growing deeper. \n\n“Shut up.” I replied through gritted teeth. \n\n“All of them are gone because of you. And for what? What have you ever done to repay them?” \n\nIt hurt. My entire body hurt as if it was in a vice pressing down. I wanted it to stop. To just stop thinking about everything.  \n\nNo, I wanted my family back. But I wanted them to be alive and well without me. If I had never been here in the first place, the world would have been much better off. I didn’t need a monster to tell me that. He was right, I hadn’t done a single thing in my life that was worth living. I was scared of that fact but also felt such regret is made me feel as if I started to sink into the floor. \n\n“There is a way to fix this.” \n\nThe voice changed to something gentle. Something cold was placed inside my hand. I didn’t need to open my eyes to know what it was. Somehow, the feeling relaxed me enough to sit back up. He was right. I could do a very easy thing. Something I should have done years ago. My eyes still closed as a hand guided my own upwards. \n\n“Go on. It'll be quick.” The voice whispered into my ear. \n\nFor a second, it all just felt right. My finger on the trigger of a borrowed gun. I thought about how much easier it would be for Jackalope to only need to look after himself and the rabbits. He no longer needed to support someone like me. Everything would be so much better in the next few seconds. \n\nAnother thought came. One that made all the others disappear. \n\nWho would put up Jackalope’s hair in the morning if I was gone? \n\nThat question broke through whatever spell the monster held on me just in time. I fired the gun and felt the hot blast so close to my face. If I hadn’t moved my hand at the last second, I would have blown open my entire face. \n\nThe creature let out a screech of fear and rage. It turned into a shriveled gruesome body. It got on all fours to make a run for it, but I turned the gun towards the monster. By some miracle I hit it. At least two bullets tore through the weak body. I didn’t think a simple weapon would be able to kill such a thing. But it let out another scream and then curled up like a dead spider. \n\nI sat, breathing heavily and hands shaking. I let the gun drop to the floor unable to hold it any longer. I wasn’t certain how long I sat in shock. My mind shut down from the entire experience. I’d been seconds away from ending everything. My phone rang but I didn’t answer it. I couldn’t face anyone at that moment. \n\nFera came back after an unknown amount of time. Her face dropped when she saw the scene inside the room. She stepped over the creature to help me to my feet. Her jacket was placed over my shoulders, and I was herded out of the room. She left me on the front step, shaking and staring blankly forwards. I knew she was calling someone, but the words didn’t reach me. \n\nMy mind went elsewhere. When I finally came back, she was sitting next to me saying something. \n\n“I never should have left you alone. We call those creatures a Whisper, because well...” \n\nFor a moment, I didn’t understand why she looked so distraught. She couldn’t bring herself to say what almost happened. That creature’s whispers nearly convinced me to do something I could never take back. But it wasn’t as if those were words I’d never thought of before. It just used how I already felt against me. If she knew that would have been a possibility, she would have never left me alone. \n\nA person stopped in front of us. I felt too damn tired to deal with him. \n\n“I am arranging some counseling for you after this event.” \n\nLupa stood in front of us, his arms behind his back and nose up over the idea I now needed even more time off. I assumed he arrived to make sure the creature wasn’t faking its death. The monster was far too dangerous for most people to deal with. \n\n“Why didn’t backup arrive sooner?! Carlos never should have been in there alone!” Fera snapped at her boss. \n\nHer face twisted in an inhuman snarl. I didn’t realize until then she only left because she thought someone would cover for her. Somehow, we already became friends without me noticing. She kept a hand on my back and I reached out to take her hand to calm her down. \n\n“He wanted to confirm If a supernatural creature was behind the deaths in the fastest way possible.” I said in an oddly calm voice. \n\nFera’s mouth dropped open. She might have tried to maul Lupa if I wasn’t there. Lupa was stronger than her, but that wouldn’t stop her from attacking him. I wasn’t upset at Lupa. I wasn’t overly useful in The Corporation. He saw this as a chance to finally use a resource. \n\n“I believe your victim complex was the reason why the Whisper was able to appear in front of you.” Lupa responded with his eyes narrowed. \n\nFera was going to say something, but I squeezed her hand to keep her silent. Lupa ignored us to walk inside. We were no longer needed so Fera saw me back home. Those magic doors sure were useful. Within a few minutes, I was standing in front of my house handing her jacket back to her. She made me promise a few times to call if I needed anything. If Jackalope wasn’t home she wouldn’t have left.  \n\nAfter I let her go, I walked inside smelling something familiar cooking. Jackalope found another one of my mother’s recipes to try out. The rabbits were already put in their room for the night. I paused in the doorway, watching his back for a minute until he looked over. \n\n“Did something happen at work?” He asked. \n\nJackalope could tell something was wrong. It would have been so easy to say everything was fine, and nothing happened. But Fera had his number. He would be angry if he found out about today through her. \n\n“Do... You know what a Whisper is?” I asked and was shocked by how soft my voice sounded. \n\nHe knew exactly what kind of monster I faced that day. I expected him to tell me to sit down for dinner and eat something, but instead, he turned off the burners on the stove. In a few steps, his long legs covered the distance between us. I wasn’t expecting him to grab hold of me with his remaining arm to try and crush my ribs in a hug. I could have brushed it all off. I was a bit embarrassed he was making such a big deal out of something I thought I could just deal with. \n\n“You smell like gunpowder.” His voice came low and soft near my ear. \n\nHe knew what happened without me saying a word. The sense of guilt tore through my body again and the dam I held back for so long finally broke. Unable to stop myself. I held him back as if the world would end if we were apart. \n\n“I'm sorry.” I choked out. \n\nWithin seconds, I broke down. My knees gave out as I cried those two words over again, unable to forgive myself. He nearly gave up his life for my own and I nearly tossed it all aside. He only wanted to see me live. I almost didn’t even do that. My body shook from the sobs. Everything hurt. I can’t even remember the last time I cried let alone that hard. I wasn’t scared he might hate me for what I’d done. I already hated myself enough, no one else could beat me on that front. \n\nWhen I finally calmed down, he pulled away just to help clean my face. \n\n“I’ll never be upset for you feeling the way you do. I’m just proud of you for coming back home.” \n\nHis gentle words hurt. It would have been easier to deal with him being angry at me. I shook my head feeling miserable. \n\n“Go have a shower. I’ll finish making dinner. After you eat, we’ll talk. Alright?” He said with an encouraging smile. \n\n“I’m really not-” I started to say. \n\n“I’m not giving you a choice.” \n\nJackalope could be very forceful when he wanted. And I didn’t really have that much fight in me. The shower did help a bit and the hot meal did even more good. I almost felt normal by the time we were finished. Jackalope didn’t stand up to gather the dirty dishes. We sat awkwardly at the table until he finally broke the silence. \n\n“Why didn’t you tell me you weren’t feeling great?” He finally asked knowing the question was an understatement. \n\nI shrugged unsure of what to say. \n\n“I thought I was fine. And when things got bad, I didn’t want to bother you. I just... was handling things until I wasn’t.” I admitted. \n\n“Are you finally going to take some real time off work to recover?” \n\nI nodded knowing that Jackalope wouldn’t let me work or do anything stressful for a while.  \n\n“Lupa said I needed some counseling.” I said, wondering when that might start. \n\n“That’s the first time I’ve ever agreed with that man.” \n\nI didn’t think it was possible, but I smiled. A small one but it was progress. My roommate would also try and killed Lupa if he knew there was a chance I got put on that case for a reason. I wonder how long I could keep that fact hidden from him. I stood up to start clearing the dishes to keep my hands busy. My mind hadn’t fully settled down yet. Jackalope let me get started on washing them as he watched from the table. \n\n“I want to go in and donate blood tomorrow. I think enough time has passed since the last time.” I said as I started to try and figure out what else I needed to do to get my life in order. \n\n“Maybe you should take it easy tomorrow. You don’t need to force yourself to be productive so soon after what happened.” Jackalope suggested. \n\nI paused washing the dishes. The soapy water soaked the front of my shirt. I wondered how Jackalope washed these so often without getting water everywhere. I mentally scolded myself for not even being able to do the dishes properly. Then I got upset for thinking such a thing. \n\n“I want to stay useful. It feels like I haven’t done a single thing.” I admitted but didn’t elaborate. \n\nI didn’t need to. Jackalope knew what I was talking about. I had already admitted how far this feeling went when we met for the second time. He knew I felt as if I didn’t deserve to keep living.  \n\n“You adopted Pesto and Houdini. And you let me stay here. On top of that, you’re doing a very important job.” Jackalope pointed out. \n\nA small spark of anger came up. I pushed it down not wanting to be upset with him.  \n\n“Anyone could do those things.” I said as I turned around to face him. \n\n“Yes, but you’re the one who did it.” \n\nSuch a simple thing. And I never let myself consider the answer. When we first met, Jackalope changed because I saw him as a person. Buying him his favorite candy was an extremely simple act but was enough to make him want to give up his life. I looked him over thinking back to the reason why I pulled the gun away at the last second. He needed help putting up his hair in the morning. And I wanted to be the one to do it. That was enough of a reason to wake up each morning. \n\n“Is... it really alright I’m still here?” I asked him softly. \n\nHis lips were torn and scarred. And yet his smile was still perfect. \n\n“Yes. Because I-” \n\nI didn’t get to hear what he wanted to say. A knock came at the back door making us jump. I was closer so I reached the door first. Neither of us had any clue who might be outside in the backyard at this time of night. I carefully opened it after turning on the backlight. The person standing at the base of the steps made my heart stop. It shouldn’t have been possible, but he stood there and made an awkward wave. \n\n“Six?!” I asked and flew down the three steps. \n\nHe looked a bit different. His mouth almost looked like an insect. His eyes were fully black and a bit larger than before. His hands also looked as if he wore some sort of jointed plastic covering his fingers.  \n\n“You look terrible.” He commented. \n\n“It’s been a rough day.” I said wondering just how much he might know. \n\nHe made a face showing he wasn’t talking about my emotional state showing on my expression. \n\n“My mustache isn’t that bad.” I said once I clued in. \n\n“It is that bad.” Six corrected. He then looked over my shoulder to nod at my roommate. “Hi, Mr. Jackalope.” \n\n“Do you want to stay for dinner? We have leftovers.” Jackalope offered from the door. \n\nSix shook his head. He needed to be somewhere else, but Jackalope offered to pack a meal to go. He left to go back inside to do so and left us alone to talk.  \n\n“They told me you died.” I said looking him over. \n\n“Oh right. Sorry. I sent a letter explaining things. It must not have shown up. My family is really strict. It’s either being an Agent or dead. A lot of my brothers fake their death to get away. The Corporation goes along with it because they know how crazy our parent is.” Six explained. \n\nI never even considered that a possibility. I wanted to believe he was alive somehow, but my brain never thought of him faking his death. I was so glad he not only looked to be doing well, but forgave me for him getting hurt on the job we worked.  \n\n“Carlos... I...” Six started and started to wring his hands together. “I wanted to thank you. For my entire life, I assumed I didn’t have options. That my kind were Agents that protected humans. But you were strong enough to protect me. And you’ve been doing so much to help even though you don’t have magic to back you up. It made me think that I could also do other things. That maybe I would be more useful living a longer life doing something else to help instead of dying young as an Agent.” \n\nI was a bit taken aback by his words. This again was something I never would have thought I would hear. I didn’t know how to deal with such a compliment. I just stood in front of him awkwardly trying to think of something to say. Jackalope came in to save me. He handed over a bag to Six telling him he could keep the containers. The now ex-Agent let out an odd chirping sound very excited about a big home-cooked meal. \n\n“What were you two talking about?” Jackalope asked. \n\nI opened my mouth to answer but wasn’t sure how to respond. \n\n“I told Carlos I liked him. I think he needs to hear that from time to time. Hey, is it alright if I drop by more often after I get settled?” Six said without a hint of shame. \n\nSix came from a huge family of brothers. Because of that, he found it easy to treat everyone like a sibling. I wished I had a younger brother like him, so I wasn’t overly embarrassed by what he said. \n\n“I like him too.” Jackalope teased. \n\nI gave his arm a light punch for trying to embarrass me. We both told Six he could stop by whenever he wanted. The fact he was alive and well lifted a massive weight off my shoulders. Six thanked us again for dinner and promised he would be back. He was faking his death and needed to keep a low profile. So, we weren’t sure when he would be able to see us again. \n\nAfter such a long day, I was exhausted. I needed a good night of sleep. But I doubted I would get one. Jackalope decided that sleep was more important than talking. In the morning we would start looking at some desperately needed therapy. Jackalope waited in the hallway until he saw me go into my bedroom. I was so tired I collapsed in bed, falling asleep in a few minutes for once. \n\nI wish I stayed asleep. I still had the Dark God problem. I nearly forgot about him. He made it pretty hard to forget he still lurked in the dark. For some reason, he was done lurking that night. \n\nI woke up feeling pressure on my chest and neck. The dark silhouette of a person sat on top of me, and already had a set of hands wrapped around my neck. I tried pulling those hands away without any luck. The God far too strong for me. He wanted to end my life just as started to get on the right track to getting better. In the dark, I saw a smile appear on his face. A set of black teeth gleamed in the dark. I couldn’t even scream for help. I scratched and kicked without any effect. Fear tore through my body making it hard to react correctly in that kind of situation. \n\nJust before I passed out, the God was suddenly pulled off and tossed clear across the room. The creature let out a scream of anger and skittered up the wall on all fours. The thing looking at my savior with flaming blue eyes. I rolled out of bed while coughing. I would rather die than what I saw. Jackalope stood at the foot of my bed, glaring daggers at the God. \n\nI never wanted them to see each other again. Not after everything he already gave up. \n\n“What's this my little bunny? Here to make another offer?” The creature said in a low raspy voice. \n\n“We are not giving you anything else.” Jackalope replied in such a stern voice it pushed the God back a step. \n\nI recovered enough to walk over to my roommate. I refused to let him face this creature alone. No matter how brave he wanted to appear, I knew he was scared as hell. His hand shook slightly at his side, so I took it. Having someone next to him helped. That God grin grew wider down towards us. \n\n“Nothing? Do you think you can get away from a God like myself? I’ll leave you children alone, but for a price. How about that other arm to even things out?” A long laugh followed his words. \n\nMy stomach twisted. I might be sick from the suggestion. I held onto Jackalope’s hand as if I would die without it. I searched through my head trying to figure out a way out of this. Then it came to me. So far, the simple answers always work. \n\n“Get out.” Jackalope said beating me to my plan. \n\nThe God’s smile faltered. He no longer was getting under our skin. We may have been scared of him but refused to let that get to us. He no longer had the power he did before. \n\n“I am a God.” The dark thing said in an angry tone. \n\n“And we don’t give a fuck. Get out of our house.” I ordered, my eyes refusing to look anywhere but that creature to make my point clear. \n\nA very long silence came between us. This monster could still rip us apart and be done with it. I had no idea what he could do and that scared the hell out of me. A smile came back to his dark face. A different one than before. \n\n“I suppose this is also amusing in a way.” \n\nThe monster did not elaborate. It just started to sink into the wall to finally disappear, taking the darkness of the room with him. For the first time in weeks, the light from the street came through the window. I’d forgotten just how bright my bedroom looked at times at night. \n\n“That... was a little scary...” Jackalope admitted. \n\nHis hand still hadn’t stopped shaking. He stood up to one of his biggest fears for his stupid roommate that couldn’t deal with his problems on his own. \n\n“I’m sorry. I thought I could get rid of him before he got this bad too.” I admitted. \n\nJackalope made a face in the dark. For a second I thought he was going to hit me. \n\n“How long has this been going on? Why didn’t you tell me?” He demanded. \n\nI refused to tell him now that I got busted. He already knew I refused to burden him with any of my problems. And it nearly killed me. \n\n“I think I’m going to pass out.” I said and was only half avoiding his questions. \n\nAfter the adrenaline of dealing with that God faded, I lost all my energy. I suddenly didn’t feel right and needed help getting back into bed. My eyes closed right away as my head swam in the dark. I heard Jackalope walk down the hallway, then come back. I thought he might be getting me a glass of water. A click came and I saw a hint of light from behind my eyelids. Then I felt someone slip next to me. \n\nI shuffled away as far as possible while still on my bed. Jackalope sat, looking about ready to crawl under my blankets to go to sleep. He even brought in his rabbit light.  \n\n“I think it’s best if I stay here tonight.” He told me without a hint of shame. \n\n“But we... We’re...You.” I sputtered, unable to form words. \n\n“Grow up. Nothing is going to happen.” He said and finished getting settled. \n\nI thought it would be hard to fall asleep with someone next to me. I couldn’t even remember the last time that happened. We were roommates. We shouldn’t be doing this, risk of a Dark God or not. Those thoughts ran through my head for at least five minutes before I passed out in the deepest sleep I'd gotten in months. \n\nI woke up hearing faint voices somewhere in the house. I sat up dazed and confused over what time it was. To my shock, I’d slept till noon. That was also new for me. Jackalope was gone. I smelled something cooking and that told me he got started on lunch. I crawled out of bed still in my sleepwear to walk into the living room. Three people greeted me when I walked out. \n\nNessie had been playing very gently with Pesto. He stooped to give me a crushing hug Fera and Six needed to pry him away from. \n\n“You didn’t tell me you dealt with a Whisper! I would have stayed last night if I knew!” Six said offended when Nessie got distracted by a rabbit again. \n\n“When he heard that he dragged us over to make sure you were doing alright.” Fera explained. \n\n“I’m fine. Why would you bother coming all the way over here?” I asked them, my brain still working slowly due to sleep. \n\n“Because we’re friends.” Six pointed out. \n\nThat was right. I knew we were friends, but it never fully clicked until that moment. These three cared about me. They didn’t even need much or a reason to do so. They just wanted me to be doing alright. Jackalope came out to say lunch would be ready soon. His hair hadn’t been put up because I slept so long. I gestured for him to come over so I could fix that for him. A few sets of eyes on us to watch. I gave them a look, daring them to say something. \n\n“Are you sure you’re doing ok?” Fera asked instead of teasing. \n\n“Yeah. At least for now.” I said with a small nod. \n\n“Good. Go and shave before lunch. I bought some new razors. They’re in the bathroom.” Jackalope ordered. \n\nThe only time he missed his other arm was when he wanted to cross them to look somewhat bossy. I glanced between them all and scratched my face. I did want to shave but didn’t think it was a big deal either way. \n\n“Is it really that bad?” I asked. \n\n“Yes!” At least three voices replied. \n\nI loved these guys, but they could be brutal. At least I got the hint. I could still hear them chatting away while in the bathroom removing the offending facial hair. I found it hard to believe that only the day before I hit rock bottom. Now there were four people inside the house ready to support me in any way possible. After I finished washing my face, I looked at myself over in the mirror. \n\nI decided that it was a good thing I was still here. Even if that feeling only lasted a few hours, it was a very good start.",

        "text": "So I live in a really old Victorian style house and sometimes the house makes weird noises. So I heard a weird noise above me so I went to check the crawl space. Now my house tends to smell... weird on occasion and there's nothing we can do so we just burn some candles. Now when I went to the crawl space it got even stronger. I felt like I was gonna vomit. It smelled like something had died up there. I get up in the crawl space with the flash on my phone. I started crawling around when it got really strong and I felt something squishy. I looked down and it was the most disturbing or maybe disgusting thing I have ever seen.\n\nIt was a human head that looked like it had been there for decades. I screamed and started back tracking and fell through the crawl space since it's not that strong and decades old. I couldn't scream. I was choked up. It's been a month and it still smells weird. At least I fell into a closet no one uses. I'm never going up there again or questioning that damn smell again.I still can't understand how something like that could ever happen. But the thing that I still question, the thing that shakes me to the core is why and how did this happen? \n\nI'm too scared to call the police because they might suspect me. But how did the head get up there? It's impossible!! The boards are too weak and you have to go up a ladder and go through this kinda shaft thing that leads to the crawl space and the roof. How could someone carry up anything even slightly heavy up there? I don't understand. I can still smell it but I'm not going back up there. The worst part is I don't live alone so it's not like no one's ever gonna go in there.\n\nThe only logical thing I can think of is that someone either got stuck up there and died with their body somehow being severed from their body or they were murdered,dismembered, and their head was put in the crawl space even if those are logical they still would not make sense at all. I can't sleep or even think because of this. I'm afraid to have anyone because they might question the smell and I don't want anything bad happening. I just don't understand how this is possible? I'm planning on just asking my roommate and life long friend if we could just pack up and leave but they love the house a lot and don't wanna leave.But I don't know what to tell her or how to tell her that I found a literal body in the crawl space that was probably older than us. I don't even have the strength to think about this any longer, every time I think of this subject I get a migraine and wanna throw up all over my room. Please DM me if anyone has any advice. To answer someone's question I posted here because it's anonymous and I think I'll be safe enough to not get police sent to my home.",

        "text": "   \n\nI never thought of myself as an unattractive woman, but I was definitely not a head-turner. I always envied the ladies who walked down the street and received admiring glances from men, especially the construction workers who whistled and catcalled. I longed for that kind of attention, and I was willing to do just about anything to get it.\n\nThat's why I found myself standing in front of a mysterious storefront one evening, worrying over whether to enter. It was small and dingy, with faded signs advertising palm reading and fortune telling. It didn't look like the kind of place I would normally visit, but I was desperate.\n\nI pushed open the door and was greeted by the scent of incense and the sound of soft music. The shop was dimly lit, and I had trouble making out the figure seated behind a small table in the corner. As I approached, the woman looked up at me with piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into my soul.\n\n\"Hello, my child,\" she said in a low, raspy voice. \"What brings you to my humble abode?\"\n\nI hesitated, suddenly unsure of what to say. But the woman seemed to sense my unease and gestured for me to sit down.\n\n\"Tell me your troubles,\" she said. \"I can help you.\"\n\nI took a deep breath and spilled out everything. How I was tired of being invisible, how I longed for the attention of men, especially those construction workers. The fortune teller listened patiently, nodding her head as I spoke.\n\n\"Ah, I see,\" she said when I finished. \"You want to be noticed. You want to be desired.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said eagerly. \"Can you help me?\"\n\nThe woman smiled a mysterious smile and reached out to take my hand.\n\n\"I can give you what you want,\" she said. \"But be warned, my dear. There is always a price to pay for such things.\"\n\nI didn't care about the price. I just wanted to be *seen*. The woman closed her eyes and began to mutter softly under her breath. I couldn't make out the words, but they sounded ancient and powerful. When she opened her eyes again, they were bright with a strange intensity.\n\n\"Your wish is granted,\" she said.\n\nI thanked her and left the shop, feeling excited and a little bit scared. \n\nIt wasn't until I stepped out onto the street that I realized my life had fundamentally changed. It seemed as if every man who passed by turned to look at me, their eyes lingering on my body. I sensed their gaze like a physical touch. But I wasn’t flattered, as I’d long fantasized I’d feel when men gazed hungrily at me. I felt uncomfortable and exposed.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore the incident, thinking it was just a fluke. But as I walked down the street, the stares appeared to become more intense, more invasive. It wasn't just the construction workers who were looking at me now. It seemed as if it was every man I passed by, regardless of age or profession.\n\nI began to feel like a piece of meat, constantly on display for the world to see. I felt violated, like I had lost all control over my own body. I tried to hurry back to the fortune teller, to get her to reverse what she had done. But every step seemed to take an eternity as I felt the weight of hundreds of male gazes upon me.\n\nWhen I finally made it back to the storefront, I was panting and shaking with fear. But the shop was closed, the fortune teller nowhere to be seen. I realized with a sinking feeling that I was trapped, that I had been given a curse instead of a blessing.\n\nI turned to run, but the night sky was now filled with countless pairs of glowing eyeballs, all fixated on me. I ran faster, my heart pounding in my chest, but the lecherous eyes followed me relentlessly. It was like they had a life of their own. \n\nI could hear their lewd whispers and feel their hunger, and I knew that I was in grave danger. I ran until I was out of breath, my legs aching and my lungs burning. But the lustful eyes were still there, still watching me, still waiting for me to adjust a bra strap or bend over to tie my shoe.\n\nI don't know how long I ran, or how far I got. All I knew was that I couldn't stop, that I couldn't let those eyes catch me. And so I ran, into the pitch dark night, pursued by hundreds of pairs of glowing eyeballs only I could see.\n\nAt long last, and only by chance, I spied my apartment building. Fumbling with my key, dropping it, picking it up, I finally opened my door, tottered inside and collapsed on the couch. \n\nI passed out for who knows how long. What I’m certain of is that when I opened my eyes, I was entirely alone. No more leering eyes. No more sense of being scrutinized, rated and ranked. I laughed, I cried, I danced with joy. I was just *me*, not the object of obscene male fantasy. \n\nBut then the headlights of a passing car swept my bedroom, exposing an army of floating eyes pressed against every window; peeking in, begging me to put on some sort of “girlie” show. Or whatever it is men crave when they switch on the “male gaze.” \n\nThe eyes were lined up, row after row, peering in through the cracks in the blinds. Gawking. Sizing me up. I grabbed my wallet and raced for the door. Maybe I could break through their ranks, grab a bus or—I don’t know—just run faster than they could follow. I was willing to try anything.\n\nComing to my senses, if only for a moment, I stopped, looked through the peephole in my front door and there was a randy, delighted eye looking back at me. Out of options, I ran into my windowless bathroom, gathered up some bath towels and shoved them beneath the door to stop anything from peering in through the gap. Then I locked the door and curled up on the cold tiles. I started to shiver and couldn’t stop.  \n\nI felt defeated. But with adversity comes inspiration, they say. \n\nHours later, as the grind of garbage trucks announced the dawn of a new day, I stood up, brushed myself off and looked in the mirror. Grabbing a pair of shears, I chopped off my hair. Chunks fell into the basin, chunks of curly, ginger hair that had been my pride and joy. Then I removed my lipstick, makeup, earrings and rings. I gathered all my remaining beauty products and threw them away. I looked in the mirror again and saw a face even a doting mother would find hard to love. \n\nBut I wasn’t done yet. I grabbed my sewing kit and feverishly went to work. I’ve always been a bit of a seamstress and an hour later had what I wanted: a ramshackle burka stitched together from the towels I’d shoved beneath the door.\n\nI put on the burka, pulling the head covering over me. Lacking a veil, I strapped on a black, left-over Covid mask. Most of my womanly assets, the features that stimulated the male gaze, were now concealed. To complete the potentially life-saving disguise, I donned an oversized pair of sunglasses. \n\nSteeling myself, I walked into living room. There was nothing but sunshine streaming in between the cracks in the blinds. I ripped open the front door and skipped to the sidewalk like a schoolkid. Only ordinary people were out and about on a bright, cloudless day. Not a single eye was flying around. Maybe I was the excitable type and there never had been. Most women are like that, men say.\n\nSuddenly thirsty, I cut across the busy street, weaving through oblivious drivers, mostly male, eyes fixed firmly on the traffic ahead. There was a Starbucks a block away, a few doors down from a small construction site. To get there, I would have to weave through a rough bunch of laborers in blue jeans and dirty t-shirts waiting in lines at food trucks.\n\nI adjusted my burka to cover stray exposed flesh. This was the moment of truth. If anywhere, the toxic eyeballing would reappear here. \n\nHolding my breath, I dove into the crowd. But there were no catcalls, no whistles. Just vile mutterings and stares of a different kind. Like a magic cloak, the burka had transformed lust into hatred. \n\nI walked into the Starbucks with a heady sense of liberation. Wearing a burka all day and night was not a desirable fashion choice, but it beat the debilitating spotlight of the male gaze.\n\nI smiled widely at the barista. “I’ll have an Orange Cream Latte and a raspberry scone.” \n\n“Sure enough,” she said, turning away to make my drink.\n\nWhich reminded me that I would have to pay. I reached into my pocket, hoping I’d remembered to bring my wallet. I’d stitched the burka together in such a blur…\n\n“Oh my god,” I whispered, even though I wanted to shriek. There was a tepid, gooey substance affixed to the interior of the pocket. Carefully, I pried it away from the fabric and brought it up. This time I did shriek. There, cupped in the palm of my hand, looking like a spent penny balloon with an iris and pupil, was a burst human eye. \n\nThe male gaze was real and still lukewarm. I held the evidence in my hand. \n\nEveryone in the Starbucks turned around to look at me. Everyone. Shrieking again, I rushed out, and kept shrieking as I elbowed my way through the construction workers, across the busy street and into my apartment. I slammed the door shut and pushed my couch in front of it. \n\nFinding a roll of masking tape, I sealed the gaps in my blinds and sealed them again for good measure. Exhausted, I staggered to the couch, clutched a pillow and began the terrifying wait.",

        "text": "It was just another day for me in Frankfurt, Germany - a bustling city with its own quirks and dangers. I was on the train, heading to the city center when I noticed a woman enter the train. She was clearly a crackhead, her eyes were bloodshot, her movements erratic, and she was mumbling to herself. I made sure to keep my distance, knowing that it was always better to be safe than sorry around such people.\n\nAs I settled into my seat, I couldn't help but notice the woman getting more and more agitated as the train started moving. She started pacing up and down the aisle, muttering something under her breath. I tried to avert my gaze, but it was impossible not to notice her. Suddenly, she turned towards me and started screaming incoherently. I tried to ignore her, but she kept getting closer and closer to me.\n\nJust as I thought the situation couldn't get any worse, she lunged towards me and grabbed my left arm tightly. I could feel her nails digging into my skin, and I knew I had to do something to protect myself. In a split second, my body moved on its own, and I found myself punching the woman in the face. She fell to the floor, and I immediately regretted what I had done.\n\nThe other passengers on the train were shocked and horrified at what had just happened. I could hear their whispers and see the looks of disapproval on their faces. I felt like a complete jerk for hitting someone, especially a woman who was clearly struggling with addiction.\n\nAs I walked out of the train station, I couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt and shame that consumed me. I realized that I needed to clear my head, so I decided to cancel my plans and take a walk in the park nearby.\n\nAs I walked through the park, I noticed a group of teenagers playing football. They were laughing and joking, and it was obvious that they were having a great time. As I watched them, I couldn't help but feel envious of their carefree attitude. I wished I could be like them, without a worry in the world.\n\nAs I continued walking, I came across an elderly couple sitting on a bench. They were holding hands and looking at each other lovingly. It was clear that they had been together for a long time and had weathered many storms. Seeing them made me realize that life was not just about the bad moments, but also about the good ones. It was about finding someone to love and cherish, and building a life together.\n\nAs I sat on a nearby bench, I started to reflect on my own life. I realized that I had been so focused on the negative aspects of my life that I had forgotten to appreciate the positive ones. I had a loving family, studying in a great university, and a roof over my head. I had so much to be grateful for, but I had been blind to it all.\n\nAs the sun began to set, I knew that it was time to head back home. But before I left, I made a promise to myself that I would try to appreciate the good moments in life, and not let the bad ones consume me. I knew that it wouldn't be easy, but I was willing to try.",

        "text": "I work on a deep sea fishing boat off the west coast of the US. For years, I’ve seen nothing odd or terrifying beyond an occasional storm or injuries given to crewmates by rigging or our catch. I’ve always loved the sea, and always felt safe and at peace on it. However, a few weeks ago, as we were pulling up our catch, something got tangled in our starboard net. When we managed to pull it aboard, it turned out to be an emergency distress buoy, one which had clearly spent a very long time in the water. We examined it, and found a slightly faded stamp in the metal and polyurethane declaring for it to be turned in to the Navy if found. While he went to the wheelhouse to radio it in, I examined further, finding that the radio emitter broken, explaining why it had never been picked up.\n\nI also discovered a sealed compartment on the side, inside which lay a waterproof baggie. It contained many pieces of paper, on which somebody with a very shaky hand had written. What unnerved me was that they seemed to have dried bloodstains on them. Against better judgment, I opened the bag and read them as we sailed back to port. When I finished, I immediately brought them to the captain, who turned pale as he read them. He jammed them back into the baggie and instructed me to place it back. The tone of his voice indicated that it was a demand, not a request. He also said that the Navy would be meeting us at the dock to collect the buoy. I did as he asked; however, before I did, I used the ship’s scanner to make copies. When we got back to port, we indeed were met by a large group of men who immediately swarmed our small vessel. They took the buoy and made us all sign a bunch of papers, saying that we would say nothing about what we found. All they would say was it was classified. They also said they’d financially reward us. When they left, the captain simply told us to forget about it. Since then, I’ve kept the copies hidden in my desk. Until now, I debated what to do, and even thought about destroying them. But, I figured that this needs to be shared, and here is the best place I know. I know I’ll likely get in very serious trouble for this, but I’ll deal with it when I cross that particular bridge.\n\nThere was a single date at the top of the first page, indicating it was written in 2016. I’m transcribing the pages exactly as written, which may take a bit, seeing as how some pages are difficult to read. I’m honestly not sure what to think of it. But, if there’s any grain of truth to what is written, I’m not sure if I will ever step foot in the ocean again. Here’s what it said:\n\nTo whoever finds this message, I beg of you: Do NOT let anyone attempt to mount a rescue operation for us. By the time you find this, I, or anyone on my team for that matter, will be long past the ability of anyone to save. I’m only writing this so somebody in the right position on the surface may have an account of the horrors that have befallen us down here. In the dark and cold void which has become my colleagues’ eternal tombs. And very soon will become mine as well. And as a warning, to try and ward off any other scientists, military, or anyone for that matter, from attempting to recover what we had been sent down here to uncover and study. It may end up being in vain; God knows, I know all too well now that us humans often fail to ignore the warnings that are subtly given to us to stay away, even when they are directly under our noses, but...I must make an attempt anyways with the little time I have remaining. Before they find where I’ve hidden myself.\n\nFor the record, my name is Desmond Windows. I’m thirty five years old, and I am...well, I *was*, a professor at the University of Oregon's Institute for Marine Biology. I had been teaching there for the last eight years after graduating at the top of my class. I always had a quick thinking and tenacious mind, able to out think and outperform even some of my own teachers. Due to my accelerated performance, I ended up graduating three years earlier than intended, and was personally contacted by the dean himself, asking if I'd be willing to take up part time tenure to help the small and very much overburdened staff down in Charleston. I immediately accepted the offer; I always loved being able to teach others about my passion for the ocean and all of its creatures, but I told him that I would also be out at times of the year, since I had also already agreed to sign on with a large oceanic research corporation, which for personal reasons shall remain unnamed, due to my years of diving experience, especially since I had been certified as an advanced open water diver, and I had also completed training and been certified to be capable of safely operating an Atmospheric Diving Suit, or ADS for short.\n\nAbout six weeks ago, I was contacted by a fellow scientist and old friend of mine. David Gimbel and I had met at an oceanic conservation panel about six years ago, though his career had taken a vastly different direction than mine had. He'd been contracted by a private group that I'd never heard of before to act as a consultant and the head diver of their underwater salvage and research division. He basically supervised the lower down members of his team on locating long forgotten shipwrecks, maintaining oil rig platforms, excavating underwater ruins, stuff of that nature, and he was allowed in return to use their diving suits and submersibles to conduct studies on deep water species of fish and cetaceans in his off time. He told me that the group had heard about my merits and expertise, not only on working in deep water, but also about my secondary degrees in ancient languages, archaeology, and oceanography, and were interested in signing me on to an expedition currently underway.\n\nApparently, while trying to map the ocean floor for wrecks, their sonar systems had detected an unusual anomaly about four thousand feet below the surface. They had passed over the anomaly a few times more, using an advanced system called Side Scan Sonar - basically for those who do not know much about mapping the sea floor, it works almost exactly like the sonar systems you have in all boats, except you use a \"towfish\", or a torpedo shape device trolled behind the boat, which emits conical pulses towards the seafloor across a wide area perpendicular to the path of the sensor, and in basic terms, creates an image or map of the seafloor it passes over. When the team had reviewed the map created, they were shocked to see, what appeared to be ruins on the bottom, across a three mile wide area. They had also discovered an American World War II battleship located less than a half a mile from the ruins, dug sideways into the seafloor.\n\nTo them, they had more or less hit the jackpot. A previously undiscovered shipwreck, which would net them a hefty financial discovery fee from the Navy, and what appeared to be sunken ruins from some ancient civilization which had once been above the waves? Its stuff people in their profession usually only dreamed about. Immediately, plans had been put in play to set down a deep ocean research station for scientists, biologists, and other assorted team members to be able to study both sites. I stopped him at that point and asked him why they would need either me or him; while both of us knew how to pilot submersibles and ROV's, our forte was in ADS suits, and the deepest one could currently go so far in one was about two thousand feet down, only halfway to the distance the sites were in. He leaned in, and in a hushed tone, explained to me that the group had, in almost absolute secrecy, with the exception of the appropriate agencies needed to certify and approve it for safety, developed an advanced version of the new Exosuits that could withstand the pressures at over five thousand feet underwater. \"They say they could theoretically keep you safe to 7500 feet\", he told me, \"But it's untested\"\n\nHe then proceeded to tell me that his group wanted me to lead the diving team to explore, film, catalog, and potentially bring to the surface some of the ruins for surface teams to study, while he would lead the team to work over the shipwreck. They would pay me handsomely for my time, in addition to being named as one of the head discovers of whatever lay down there. I would become immortal in the history books for my findings as well. The amount of zeroes Gimbel told me would be on my paycheck, plus the opportunity to be remembered forever went to my head immediately, and before he could even say anything else, I told him I would take their offer. ....*Such a goddamn stupid decision*.\n\nI was almost immediately afterward flown from the US to New Zealand, where I boarded the group's ship, the *Oceanic Explorer*, in Auckland, and spent almost a week heading to our destination, which lay about two hundred miles from the Pitcairn Islands. When we arrived, we were greeted by five other ship's clustered around one area of sea, two belonging to the same company, and three the Navy. They had rigged a platform that dangled between them where the submersibles could arrive, dock, and then disembark again into the depths. Once tied up with the other vessels, Gimbel and I were taken to a private briefing led by a man who clearly couldn't even fit into a diving suit if his life depended on it. No, he was clearly a topside leader. He sat us both down and, after having us sign over half a dozen non-disclosure agreements, to make sure that we wouldn't blab to any reporters before they could announce their findings themselves; you could tell they had been fucked over before more than once by that problem, he showed us the map created by the sonar. Both of us stared in almost utter shock at what we saw.\n\nThey were definitely ruins, all right. They lay in many patterns, the innermost almost circular in pattern, with outcroppings leading off in a straight direction. That was the biggest giveaway. Nature does not do straight lines. He also pointed out the battleship wreck lying just off to the side, which David focused on, but I was too enthralled by what I saw to care. I studied every inch of the sonar image of those ruins, mentally mapping them into my mind, deducing where the best place to start my sweep would be. My mind was racing with endless possibilities as well. *How old would they have to be, to remain undiscovered for so long?* Certainly I could understand why nobody had ever found them. We've only explored about five percent of the ocean so far, and anything could be hidden in that remaining ninety five percent.\n\nAfter we'd been finished with our regular briefing, the man, named LeCasey, warned us that a tropical storm was brewing about eighty miles to the west of us, and was heading in our direction. He told us that if it didn't alter its course, the topside ships would have to pull out to a safer location until it passed, which he said out here, could take a couple of weeks. We'd also be out of radio contact with them as well, which meant that if any emergency arose beneath the waves, all we'd have would be the onboard doctor, her staff, and her equipment. We both told him that we understood, and we'd make sure to keep ourselves and our team as safe as we possibly could. After, we were both ushered from the ship onto the platform, where a lone, three man submersible waited to take us down. Carrying only one duffel bag of clothing and personal belongings each, we squeezed into the tight interior, and the hatch was sealed. Two safety divers swam around us, making final checks to be sure the submersible was ready for descent. One approached the small window in the front and flashed the okay sign to our pilot. I craned my neck to catch a final glimpse of the orange sunset disappearing on the horizon, and then we slipped quietly below the waves and began our descent into the deep.\n\nThere's a reason why the area of water where we were heading is dubbed \"The Midnight Zone\". When you’re down there, you are so far from the surface that no light can reach you. Aside from the artificial lights of the sub, or the occasional flashes made by deep sea creatures, there is nothing around you but blackness. An impenetrable darkness that almost seems to reach out with vast, unseen clawed hands to wrap around you, like it wishes to suffocate you in its unending embrace. Even when you've dove in water this deep a hundred times, you still get an eerie, almost primal sense of fear looking out past where the light cannot reach, because you can't see what lurks just beyond the veil. I feel ashamed, like a little child afraid of monsters under the bed or in the closet, by saying that I felt a huge sense of relief when I spotted the station appearing beneath us, the darkness shooed away by dozens of lights mounted on and around it. I could see other divers in what had to be the new exosuits plodding around the outside of the base, setting up their final camera systems and setting down huge cases of equipment for the coming days and weeks of exploration and surveying. Our sub moved into position and hooked onto a hatch that would allow us to transfer from it into the base itself.\n\nAfter the water had been drained and the pressure equalized, the pilot unscrewed the hatch and opened it for us to climb through. He gave us a cheerful smile and a pat on the back as we climbed through. \"Have a good stay, lads!\" he called after us with an Irish accent. \"I'll be seein' ya in about six to seven weeks. Be safe!\" We both thanked him, and then he sealed the hatch again, disconnected himself from the station, and slowly began his long ascent back up to the surface, leaving the two of us to marvel at what we had stepped into.\n\nIt was clear that tens of millions, if not *billions* of dollars had been invested into designing the base. It had been placed directly between the two sites, and it was huge. Of course, it had to be to accommodate the number of people on our two teams, plus the three members of the medical staff. The entire structure had been made from a metal that could withstand the immense pressure pressing down on it from all sides. You could always hear the structure creak and groan as it won its endless battles with the water outside. Right away we were met by the base's leader, a tall, lanky man with hair that stuck out like the spines of a sea urchin named Carruthers. He showed us to our cabins to drop off our gear, then escorted us to the main observation area and operations room, located in the center of the base. There was a rather large dome window dominating the far wall, made out of extremely strong and durable Plexiglas that allowed anyone in the room to look out at the work any divers in the immediate vicinity were doing, along with a bank of consoles on the opposite wall that showed the views of half a dozen cameras mounted outside, and also ones that were mounted on the shoulders of the exosuits. I took a glance out the window at the darkness, just out of range of the lights, and unwillingly shuddered, before shaking my head and turning back to Carruthers and Gimbel. *You're absolutely obsessed with the ocean, and have been almost as deep as this before*, I chided myself. *You know better than most people what really lays in the gloom, so stop looking out there and letting your subconscious think up things that aren't there*. Shaking the feeling from my mind, I focused in and listened to the man speak.\n\nHe filled us in on what had been done so far. They had set up the perimeter around the base, and had also set up rope guides with light poles leading to both sites, but hadn't actually begun any surveying yet; they had been instructed to wait on our arrival to begin that stage of work. We were to rest up and meet our respective teams when they returned from outside; tomorrow, we would both set out on our respective paths to begin our initial sweeps. We would each be in charge of 6 people, plus ourselves. He told us that everyone had been handpicked by the group's board members for their qualifications and merits, and that they could all handle themselves under intense pressures and time constraints. All they needed were natural leaders, and that was us. He first walked David through the info they had acquired on the battleship, and this time, I chose to listen out of sheer curiosity. He said that the ship had gone missing halfway through the war without a single trace. Their last report had been that they were about to be battered by a huge storm, but their last known location was what baffled me.\n\nAccording to a few declassified military records they had been given by the Navy, when the last known position had been transmitted, it was all the way up near the Philippines. Thousands of miles away from here. My mind raced with confusion, trying to use reason and logic to come to a sensible conclusion. *How in the hell could they have been blown this far off course?* I could understand that they may have been blown a few hundred miles from where they should, but this far? *Surely they would have noticed, if not with their equipment, then at least by maps, the stars and constellations*. At least the fact there was no land for hundreds of miles. I couldn't make sense of it. The look on David's face told me he had the same thoughts. Carruthers explained that the US Navy had been notified immediately about the wreck, and they had asked personally for it to be photographed and documented for their records, along with ours. It was the primary reason for their financial aid. They wanted to know what had caused the wreck as much as we did.\n\nAfter he finished, he turned to me and only said very brief words about my expedition. There wasn't really much he could say anyways. They had little to no information about the ruins, other than what I had been told on the surface and the sonar map. He did say that he wanted my team and I to move very slowly, as nobody could tell how old they really were. After we finished documenting and cataloguing everything where it lay, then we could begin to see if we could lift any pieces and bring them back to the base to study. I told him I understood and was ready when he deemed it was time to go. Inside though, I was bursting with the excitement and giddiness of a child discovering a Native American arrowhead in a stream. I couldn't wait to get out there and set foot in a place that nobody could have set in thousands of years. Even still, and though I mentally kicked myself for the ridiculous emotions I felt, I still refused to turn and look out in the abyss until I left the room and closed the hatch behind me.\n\nThat evening, we met everyone at dinner in the galley. My team was comprised of four men and two women; King, Alten, Figueroa, Brockmann, Nodding, and Carpenter. All of them were very experienced deep sea divers. King, Brockmann and Nodding were commercial salvage divers; all three had worked together for over ten years, and you could easily tell that there was a distinct comradery between the three of them. Alten, Figueroa and Carpenter were more along the lines of my work; Figueroa being a fellow marine biologist and oceanographer herself, and Alten and Carpenter had both graduated from Florida State with degrees in Archaeology and Oceanography, and were also accredited surveyors. We soon all struck up a friendly vibe from various discussions about our shared love of the water, of eighties horror movies and various other subjects, and within an hour were laughing and joking like we had known each other for years. I could see David had also won over his team, though I had never gotten the time to properly learn any of their names. Now that I think about it...I never really learned any of their names, except for the few he ever said to me. We finished up eating, and then each retired to our respective quarters to rest up for the huge undertaking we'd all be facing tomorrow. And while we may have all gone to sleep wishing the other pleasant dreams, with the exception of Figueroa; being an apparent prankster, she snuck a rubber eel into Nodding's bed, causing him to scream with an almost girly, high pitched scream which caused the rest of us to burst into uncontrollable laughter,  I couldn't fall asleep peacefully.\n\nMy mind seemed unable to shut down, and I tossed and turned, all the while feeling like there were fingers running themselves around inside my head. I glanced at one of the only personal possessions I had brought with me on the metal table beside the bed. A framed photograph of a smiling face, long raven black hair, olive colored skin, and emerald green eyes, a white smile beaming out from an amazingly happy moment. *Jackie*.... I turned away, unwilling to let my mind dive down that road, and again felt that weird feeling, like my skull was being massaged and probed around from within. For a moment, I swore I could almost hear her voice calling my name. *Desmond.* I shook it away, forcing myself to ignore it and fall asleep. Knowing what I do now, though, if I'd realized what it had meant....I almost feel like I would have willingly walked to one of the diving airlocks and let the water rush in, drowning all of us. It would have been a death less horrific and painful then they ended up with.\n\nWe awoke early the next day, all buzzing with anticipation at what we were about to do. My team and I were directed into the east airlock, and David and his were sent to the west. We all helped one another into our suits, and one of the medical team checked to make sure that they were all pressurized and sealed. They sealed the inner airlock door, and then flooded the room, pumping in seawater from outside. Once the room was completely filled, the outer hatch opened, and one by one, we slowly stepped out into the void. *They have definitely done an amazing job on the exosuits, I can't deny that*. They withstood the pressure outside perfectly, and were only as slow and cumbersome as the older models were. Like the previous model, they were equipped with shoulder mounted lights, built in heating units to keep the freezing cold of the outside water at bay, and a remote camera mounted on the side of the helmet for Carruthers and the rest of the people inside to watch. Also brought over were two thrusters mounted on top of our oxygen canisters that were controlled by joysticks and switches inside the suit. Walking around on the bottom of the ocean is almost exactly like walking on the surface of the moon; it's extremely slow going, so the thrusters aid you in moving around at a faster pace. We made sure our comms were working, both between each of us and the base itself, and after quickly instructing my team to stay safe, take their time working, keep in constant communication, and most importantly, to always work in teams of two and never wander off alone, we moved over to the equipment waiting for us near the beginning of the guide rope, picked it up, and then began our journey towards the ruins.\n\nThe trip took us about fifteen minutes to make. I was thankful for the guide rope and the lights that were spaced about thirty feet or so along the line; after all, down here, all it takes is a split second, one wrong step into the darkness, and you can easily become lost and disoriented. There are stories stretching as far back as the beginning of deep sea diving of divers who became lost in the blackness, never to be seen again. I kept my gaze focused straight ahead of me, waiting to see my first glimpse at the reason I'd been brought down here. And a few minutes later, I was rewarded for my vigilance. \"Holy Jesus, Mother of God\", I heard Figueroa almost breathe. The sonar map hadn't been able to properly show the enormity of the site. The first stone pillars we saw, covered with ages of muck, algae and growth, rose high above our heads, almost to the point that the top of them were out of sight in the gloom provided by the final guide light. I knew there were more beyond it, just out of sight, but the thought that all of this covered an almost three mile wide stretch of ocean floor was almost uncomprehendable to my brain. I was absolutely awestruck, my entire team was as well, but I shook my head to clear it.\n\nWe had a job to do today, and only about nine or ten hours of oxygen to get it done. I turned back to my team, and gave them their tasks of the day to perform. We all would work as one unit at first, setting up lights in and around the inner portion of the site to be able to properly see what we were doing; once that was finished, Alten and Carpenter would begin their surveying duties, using a remotely operated variation of the Side Scan Sonar system to give us a three dimensional map of the entire site, which would then be transmitted back to the base for us to look over at the end of the day. While they were doing that, the remaining five of us would divide into teams of two to do an initial sweep of the area, shooting video and taking still photographs for documentation. We would do other tasks, including trying to date the ruins another day. With my instructions finished, along with a reminder to stay safe and alert, we began work.\n\nWith the seven of us working in tandem, we were able to set up the lights in less than two and a half hours, and when we were finished, the darkness had been banished away, the ocean forced to reveal what it had kept hidden for so long. It was absolutely incredible. Somehow, even after all this time, despite the ocean currents and the crushing embrace, almost all of the pillars had remained intact, save for a select few that had crumbled into large piles of stones. Alten and Carpenter had already begun their survey, you could easily hear the whirring of the sensor as it wound its way through the ancient structures; occasionally, you could see the bright yellow machine move slowly over your head as they joked with each other and made bets about who would win an upcoming baseball game they would miss. Meanwhile, we had each teamed up and moved slowly down the rows of pillars towards the circular center.\n\nI had chosen to have Figueroa partner with me; not only had she and I developed the best rapport of everyone, but in my professional opinion, she seemed the most centered, calm and astute of the rest of us. We each took a side and filmed and photographed pillars every couple of feet, getting closer to where it all converged, maintaining constant radio contact with each other and the other groups. About halfway down, she called me over to her side. \"Take a look at this, Windows\" she said, and proceeded to use the claw hand of her suit to rub away the muck as gently as possible. For a second, I couldn't distinguish a damn thing, but then I realized what she had spotted. There were images carved deeply into the stone. Some were pictures, and others were what I could only assume were hieroglyphs or an ancient language I couldn't read. I didn't need to though; the carved pictures were sufficient enough to explain themselves.\n\nDepicted on the small portion of exposed stone that I could see was what I can only describe as...something truly monstrous. The creature was gargantuan in size, with the head of a Wolf Eel, one gigantic black eye staring directly at the viewer, and an almost humanoid body, covered in what appeared to be black scales. It reached towards the surface with webbed, clawed hands for what looked like a tribal boat, its occupants cowering in fear at their sealed fate. Around it's torso swam smaller creatures, what had to be underlings of the monstrosity; they, too, appeared to be humanoid in shape, but with the heads of Viperfish atop their shoulders, their huge, razor sharp maws poised open to catch the unfortunate victims that managed to avoid death from their leader. I scraped away algae from the carving underneath and shuddered softly at the next image. The huge creature had dragged the entire ship down to the bottom of the ocean and was...slowly torturing its drowning victims. Limbs had been torn off, and a clear expression of malicious glee adorned its inhuman features. Still others were being torn to shreds by the smaller monsters; the carving was so detailed that I could see each individual expression of horror and pain eternally frozen on each person's face. \"My God...\" I heard Figueroa say next to me. I shook my head. \"I'm as much of a scientific man as you can be, Liza, but that\", I closed my eyes, the images burned into the back of my eyelids, \"that is the furthest thing from God you could possibly get\" I opened my eyes again, raised my camera and snapped off a few shots of the carvings, then turned away, an almost desperate need to get away from whatever ancient civilization had conjured up that beast overwhelming me. \"Come on, let's get to the center and finish up today's work\"\n\nThe circular center was absolutely massive. We estimated it to be almost a mile and a half across from the end of one row of pillars, to the beginning of another on the far side. Here and there, we could see some smaller formations rising up to about chest height at varying distances, but for the most part, it was flat, save for an odd spiral that had been carved into the smooth stone deep enough that the outline could still be seen; when you dropped down onto it, you could feel the dips, even through the ages of mud and muck that had accumulated over it. We all moved out to a distance of about five feet from one another and, as a team, slowly moved across to the other side. We were about halfway across when I heard Nodding let out a shout of surprise, followed by curses. \"Everyone stop!\" I called. \"Nodding, you alright?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine\" was the muttered reply I received. I needed more information, though; when you're working in deep water, one small mistake can cost a diver his life. \"What happened?\" I pressed. After a few seconds of silence, he answered.\n\n\"Goddamn Gulper Eel suddenly appeared out of nowhere, coming straight for my face. Caught me off guard, and I stumbled back into a rock formation. Nothing's damaged on my suit, I just finished checking\" I let out a sigh of relief as the rest of the group burst into laughter. \"What, were you afraid that you were gonna be swallowed whole?\" Brockmann said in a sing-song voice, trying to lighten the mood. Everybody laughed harder, myself and even Nodding joining in. It helped loosen the sudden burst of tension that had fallen over us for that split second, after all. Even from fifteen feet away, I could see the sheepish expression he wore through his faceplate. \"I just got startled to hell and back, that was all\" he said in return. He sighed. \"I hate to say this, Windows, and I'm sorry, but when I backed into that formation, I knocked it over\" I thrusted around the others to inspect the damage. He was right; the small pillar had indeed been knocked over. It lay on its side, a small shroud of muck settling around it. It still looked to be in one piece, however. \"It's okay Nodding, it didn't break at all, just fell on its side. You're safe from being chewed out by me or Carruthers\" He let out a relieved sigh, and then looked down at the gauges lining the inside of his suit. \"Thank Christ. Well, we got two hours of oxygen remaining boss. You wanna finish up surveying this area and head back to base?\"\n\nI didn't answer him right away, however. I was staring down at where the pillar had clearly been knocked out from. There was a slot there, a rectangular opening about three or four feet across. But it didn't seem to only go down a few inches or even a few feet. The blackness in that space seemed greater, almost as if there was a space much larger and deeper beneath it. I felt the same, odd sensation in my head again, this time a little stronger. And, for a split second, I was overcome with a desire to...*peer* into the slot, to even swim into it. It was almost as if something had hooked itself into my brain and was trying to reel me in. I was snapped out of my moment by Brockmann calling my name. \"Windows?\" she asked tentatively. I looked up at everyone. They all wore puzzled, confused expressions on their faces as they stared at me. Shaking away the last tendrils of my insane thought, I pulled myself together. \"Yeah, you're right Nodding. Let's finish up this area and be done for the day\"\n\nThe next three weeks proceeded without incident for my own team, as well as David's. We both made very good progress on our respective sites, cataloguing and documenting extensively. The feeling that I'd had during that first dive hadn't returned since, and I felt more like myself, more eager to learn all we could about the ruins. The surface team had contacted us two days ago, and had informed us that the storm was almost on top of us, so they would have to pull back until the storm either passed by, or blew itself out. They did, however, authorize us to bring back a few pieces of the site to further study, and we had very selectively chosen three smaller ones, using commercial lift bags to float them back to the base. Once inside, they had been brought to the lab for us to clean up and study. There had been more carvings depicting the same monster as I'd seen on the carving I'd examined the first time, along with what we now were sure had to be a very ancient language.\n\nUsing specialized scanning equipment, we had put it into a computer and had set it to attempt to translate to English. So far, it had been running for almost three days with no success. We headed back out in the meantime to document the outer edges of the site, one of what we assumed to be our final initial passes. We had again divided up into teams of two, and had fanned out over a distance of about a hundred feet from the next team. This time around, I'd paired up with Carpenter, who'd volunteered to help me photograph and film the end of one particular row of pillars. We were about halfway done with our job, when I noticed a glint of something red and metallic reflecting off the glow of the nearest light. I turned and felt my jaw drop open.\n\n*What…in the absolute fuck?* I was staring at a *tricycle*. A goddamn red children's tricycle, sitting perfectly upright on the bottom, not even twenty feet away from me. Confusion filled my mind. *How in the hell did THAT get down here??* I narrowed my eyes and tried to think of a logical explanation. It could have fallen off someone's boat as it passed over the area, but there were two things that just seemed...*wrong* to me. If it had fallen off someone's boat, it had to have been very freaking soon. It still had all of its paint on it, and there was absolutely no sign of rust. Not to mention that there was not even a tiny bit of algae covering it. But, more unsettling than that, was the creeping sensation I felt. That tricycle, I couldn't put my finger on it, but it....it looked *familiar*. Almost as if I'd seen it before somewhere. Trying to shake off the odd feeling, I turned and called to Carpenter's back.\n\n\"Hey, Sean, would you fucking look at this? I just found an honest-to-god tricycle down here on the-\" I trailed off as I turned back. It was gone. It had vanished into thin air. Or in this case, thin water. I blinked a couple of times, trying to rationalize with my own mind. \"What the...\" I shook my head hard, then looked down at my gauges, suddenly concerned with my own safety. *Am I developing N.N.???* Nitrogen Narcosis is a reversible, but at these depths a very dangerous alteration in consciousness caused by the anesthetic effect of certain gasses at high pressures, which comes with a variety of symptoms. One of which includes auditory and visual hallucinations. To combat this, we were using a mixture of helium and oxygen in our air supply, but at these previously unventured depths with diving suits, I wondered if the mixture wasn't potent enough to ward off the onset. \"You say something, boss?\" I heard Carpenter call behind me. Still trying to come to a conclusion in my own mind, I decided not to tell him what I'd just seen. Not yet, anyways. \"Nothing, man\" I called back. For another minute or so, I gazed out into the darkness, trying to piece together jigsaw puzzles in my mind, to figure if we should head back or not, just in case my assumptions were correct. I decided it'd be better to be safe than sorry. \"Hey, Sean, let's round up the others and head back to base. I don't think something's right here\" He didn't answer me. I turned, my worry giving way to a small twinge of annoyance. \"Did you hear me, man?”\n\nCarpenter was gone. There was absolutely no trace that he'd ever been there, except for his bag of gear, which lay untouched where he'd put it down. *What the shit?!* I looked down the row of columns to see if I could see the orange-yellowish outline of his suit or the beam of his shoulder lights. Nothing. *Where the hell did he go?!* He couldn't have slipped away that quietly, the thrusters make too much sound to do so, and unless he'd somehow mastered running away underwater in an eight hundred pound diving suit, he couldn't have disappeared on foot. Confusion gave way to the first tendrils of worry. I looked up at the nearest team to me, which were Figueroa and Brockmann. \"Hey, guys?” I called out in a voice that shook a little. \"Did either of you see Carpenter pass by you?\" They both looked over in confusion at me. “No, isn’t he with you?” I didn’t answer. Worry had begun to be crept up on by the first real tendrils of fear. I tried to keep my mind in check, I had to control myself; all of my team were counting on me to get them back safely, but in my mind, I couldn't help it. My memory shot back to a painting I'd purchased for my house about three years ago. A painting of a deep sea diver in an old school suit, light emanating from his helmet, as dozens of huge tentacles appeared behind him out of the gloom, ready to snatch him in an eternal embrace and drag him backwards to a watery grave-\n\nI spun around to face the darkness that I had turned my back to, almost half expecting to see that very sight before me. But there was nothing there. Just blackness. By this time, I could hear the rest of my team churning up frenzy over the comms. They had all heard me, and were now calling out, trying to get Carpenter to reply to them, to no avail. Carruthers was also trying to cut through the barrage of voices, trying to understand what was going on. Sheer panic and chaos had suddenly come crashing down on all of us. Pulling myself together, I summoned all of the emotional strength I could muster. “Shut up!” I yelled as loud as I could into my mic. The jumble of voices ceased immediately. Quickly, I relayed to Carruthers what had happened, and asked him what the best course of action would be to take, with the knowledge that we only had about an hour and a quarter of air remaining. He was quiet for a moment, and then gave the order for us to search for our missing teammate for fifteen minutes, no longer. Then get our asses back to the base, on the double. “Copy that” I told him, and then told the rest of my team to gather up at my position.\n\nAs one, we made our way through the ruins for the next fifteen minutes, calling out over the comms, trying to get a response from Carpenter. But we found no trace of him at all. It was as if he'd been wiped from existence. With a vise gripping around my heart, and an unshakeable feeling of dread coursing through me, I gave the order at fifteen minutes for the rest of us to head back, and stay close to each other. As we began our way back along the guide line, I swear that it felt like the darkness held at bay around us by the lights seemed to creep just a little bit closer, as if testing to see if it could reach us.",

        "text": "The next day I was tired. \n\nErica and I both called in from work. (I insisted E stay home today so we could talk and take a break.) \n\nThe vision was eating away at me, so I decided to tell E about it. \n\nShe looked uncomfortable as I did. She wouldn’t meet me at my eyes the entire time. \n\nWe didn’t do much, then decided to go to dinner at a restaurant. \n\nOnce there, Erica started looking nervous. \n\n“Did you not want to eat here babe?” I ask kind of questioning why she’s acting strangely. \n\n“No no, it’s fine.” \n\nWe walk in a take a table with 3 seats because it’s all they have left for small groups. \n\nWe had just received menus to look at when a strange girl walks up to the table. \n\nDyed pink hair, pink sweater, red skirt, and hazel eyes. \n\nShe’s wearing lots of makeup and looks sorta out of place. \n\nShe smiles at us. \n\n“Hehe, mind if I join you?” \n\nBefore I can process Erica actually nods and the girl sits down. \n\nI look across the table and Erica won’t meet my eyes again. \n\n“Hey, Erica, mind if we talk about something over here?” \n\nShe almost winces when I say this, but gets up and follows me. \n\nI give a fake smile to the intruder, then lead Erica over to the bathroom. \n\n“Okay, what is going on her? Who is she and why are you acting weird?” \n\nAs I try to control my voice, if comes out as a hiss. \n\nErica is balking at telling me. \n\nI give up and go to the table deciding to question the girl instead. \n\nBut as I am walking back I suddenly feel extremely uncomfortable. \n\nThrough the windows I see a little girls face watching the restaurant. She quickly fades away. \n\nThe girl at the table is still there.\nI get more and more uneasy as I approach her. \n\nWhen she turns and looks at me I know I need to run. \n\nHer eyes have rolled all the way back in their sockets.  \n\nShe pulled off the sweater to reveal a tee shirt that had been cut above her stomach. \n\nThere, where the flesh of her tummy should be, was a huge gaping mouth. Black ooze around the edges and a huge pink tongue.\n\nThe girl started to push over the table. \n\nThen leaping on top of the nearby bar, began smashing glasses. Glass was flying everywhere. \nPeople were screaming and trying to run out of the building. \n\nI ran back to the bathroom, realizing Erica hadn’t come out. \n\nWhen I found her she was laying on the floor, back against the wall. \n\n“Babe! Erica, come on, we have to leave!” \n\nI tried to pick her up and help her, but she stopped me. \n\n“Babe, you leave. Get somewhere safe. It’s…too late f ffor me now…” \n\nShe was struggling to speak. I could now see black ooze coming out the corner of her mouth. \n\nE what happened?! \n\n“That girl, she’s a demon. She trapped me and I was poisoned. She didn’t kill me, but “it’s” toxins mixed with my blood. \nThat’s a human shell Cy, whatever that thing is is inside her. The human is dead.”\n\nShe said this all breathless. I was holding her head now. \n\n“How long have you been sick for E?” \n\nTears were starting to fall down my face. \n\nErica tried to speak, but then couldn’t manage. She gasped for air once, then stopped breathing. \n\nI then heard something slam against the bathroom door. \n\nThe thing had found me. With E gone now I didn’t know what to do. \n\nI stood up and looked for an escape. \n\nSeeing none. \n\nThe demon entered.\nIt now was carrying 2 kitchen knives in its hands. \n\n“Why did you do this to her!?” I said screaming and pointing at E.\n\nThe demon now seemed incapable of talking, it just stood there with the knives. \n\nAs it came forward at me I dodged and ran out the door. \n\nI ran as fast I as I could out to my car.\n\nThe restaurant was in chaos. Broken glass everywhere, people laying injured or dead, blood on the floors. A window had even been broken. \n\nOnce out in my car I started it and drove a bit away. \n\nOnce I thought I had a moment, I stopped the car and told the police the whole story. I didn’t go back until about an hour to the restaurant. \n\n\nOnce there the police informed me that Erica was actually okay miraculously. I was stunned. She hobbled out and met me outside. I hugged her. \n\n“I am so glad you’re okay!” \n\nShe smiled but didn’t say anything. \n\nWe stood together as police also informed us that the demon had died, leaving the human shell with a huge scar across its stomach where the mouth had “withered” and rolled inward. \n\nWhy it picked that person we don’t know, it could have been random or calculated. \n\nThe demon had died of lack of energy. It hadn’t eaten enough and used it’s last bit of life chasing me.\n\nThe restraint had mostly been cleaned up, the bodies had been taken and the survivors hospitalized. \n\nI realized the vision I had of the girl on the couch looked a bit like the girl the demon had been using. \n\nHad I momentarily seen the future? I’ll never know, but after tonight me and Erica haven’t been bothered. The murders in our area completely stopped too. It seems the demon had been killing people. \n\n\nI’ll have a separate post on E’s story, we’re both tired rn and are going to rest.",

        "text": "Now I uploaded a story recently that people seemed to really enjoy. I decided to write this one after a lot of debate with friends and family, as it is more of an impact to my psyche and had an effect on the people around me. This story, and this story alone brought me to therapy.\n\nFor context for this story, I was going on a camping trip with my family members at age ten. They are all rather used to nature as they live out in the sticks in Canada, and all went camping regularly. Now we didn't go to any set campgrounds, but instead we decided to head out to the middle of the forrest where my cousins had done days of labouring work ahead of time, cutting down trees so we can fit an RV on our own 'private' campground. In total we were six people.\n\nThe first night was rather normal except for one point in the middle of the night. The sky was clear with a nice view of the stars overhead. We were sitting around a campfire, watching the flames burn and listening to the crickets and other forrest noises. Then at one point we were in the middle of a conversation, when I saw one of my cousins turning and twisting in his chair as he tried to get a good view of the tree line. We stopped our conversation immediately and our heads snapped to look at him. He turns to us and says \"You guys hear that?\" We looked at each other as we focused in on the sounds around us. I only heard the fire crackling, and that was the issue. The sounds of the forrest completely stopped. Out of fear of a big animal approaching, my cousin rushed into the RV to get a gun while the rest of us followed. We waited for an hour or two in the RV, waiting for the sound of footsteps but none came. The forrest returned to its natural state and it was lively again.\n\nAfter that first night we didn't get as much sleep as we were scared a bear or maybe a pack of wolves were going to come around, that would be the least of our issues it seemed. But never the less we continued to camp like nothing happened. That next day we were out on the lake fishing when we saw a few people dotting a small little island in the middle of it. It wasn't necessarily unnatural to see people out here, but what we were doing was technically illegal so we didn't want a lot of people seeing what we were doing. But we continued to fish calmly as to not draw attention to ourselves.\n\nAfter 15 minutes or so of fishing, we saw a boat depart from that island and head directly toward us. We considered booking it but we realised that it would make our presence seem more suspicious, so we waited. They eventually got to us and there were two men in the boat. One of them was skinny and had a white tank top, jean shorts, and a blue cap. The other one was more plump and wore a camo vest with a white t-shirt underneath, matching jean shorts, and the same blue cap.\n\n\"Hey, what're you guys doing out here!\" said the skinny man, already sounding somewhat accusatory. We told him that we just drove out here today just for a day of fishing. Despite our somewhat normal story, they seemed to see through our charade. When the plump man interrupted my cousin and said. \"You guys don't happen to know about that fire on the other side of this lake do ya?\" My cousin tried to lie and said he had no clue, and tried to confirm that we only got there that morning just to fish. After a few more lines of dialogue they seemed to believe us and told us not to stay until night fall as the 'animals' are bad in the area. They turned their boat around and headed back to the island. Me and my cousin looked at each other thinking we dodged a bullet, but that bullet would still head directly towards us.\n\nThat night it happened. Four of my cousins decided to hunt through the night as they had made a custom hunting blind earlier that day. They took the weapons and headed out as me and my other cousin headed to sleep for the night. I was listening yet again to the sounds of the forrest, and I was also listening when they started to fade away again. As they faded away new sounds emerged in the night. Footsteps. Initially I thought it was my cousins coming back from the hunt after getting something. But to my dismay, it wasn't. I heard someone say \"Hey you kids here?!\" Even at such a young age I could tell there was malicious intent behind these words. I slowly got out of the bunk bed and swiftly moved toward the closest window to ensure my dread was warranted. As I peaked out of it I saw the same two guys from the boat and three people I've never seen before. Despite the change in apparel I can tell it was them.\n\nAs they walked into our campsite they went to the two tents in front of the RV where we kept some extra supplies. They barely looked inside before all of them turned to the RV and slowly stepped over to it. I tried to silently bolt over to my cousin to try and get his help and wake him up. But when I started shaking him awake he said loudly \"leave me alone it's the middle of the night...\"\n\nThat triggered a chain of events I only thought would be possible in my nightmares.\n\nImmediately after saying that, these guys started banging on the RV telling us to open up and unlock the door. The second they started doing this, my cousin woke up fast and ran to the kitchen and opened a drawer to find some kitchen knife. We got far away from the door and waited for the banging to stop. When it did the door flew outward and we saw three of the guys stomp into the RV. They slowly looked around the cramped RV and stopped when they finally caught our gaze.\n\nOur fear was obvious. There was no mistaking it for any other emotion, we had no power here. The skinny man from earlier walked over to us and my cousin swung his knife at him. It cut his hand a little bit, but he got adrenaline from it and ripped the knife from his hand and it clambered onto the ground. We were defenceless, so when they grabbed me and put me on my feet and forced me out of the RV all I could do was scream and struggle.\n\nThey gripped me by the collar of my shirt as they led us deeper into the forrest in the middle of the night. I tried to scream but they'd put their hand over my mouth. I looked over to my cousin who had the same thing happen to him. We couldn't do anything. The guys were laughing and joking around like this was any normal situation for them. As we walked deeper into the forrest the less we tried to struggle. We nearly gave up when finally, my cousin bit the hand of one of the men and was able to let out one more shriek. After grunt of pain, the guy immediately punched my cousin in the face to keep him quiet and put his hand back over his mouth.\n\nWe were getting close to the lake when finally we heard a loud crack. One of the guys blurted out \"Gun shot!?\" They were clearly confused, when we heard two more gun shots ring out. The guys let go of us and we heard my cousins yelling at them. It was almost incoherent to me, purely from the suddenness of it. Our captors ran off into the forrest leaving us standing there in shock.\n\nOur cousins came over and assisted us back to the camper van. I was shaking and shivering despite it being a warm night. They tried to talk but I could only shake my head and nod. We left that night and I wasn't able to sleep well for weeks after the occasion. Thinking of what would've happened if my cousin wasn't able to make that noise that drew my cousins back to us.\n\nWe told the local officers in the end and told them about it, risking the fine for technically camping illegally. In the end they never found the guys and we haven't heard from the police since.\n\nSo guys be careful out there. Make sure you know your area and what is around you. Always stay cautious.",
