        "text": "I just watched it a few days ago for the first time and found most of the discussion was around the ending, but I thought there was quite a few other major gaps in the plot and had some ideas on what would have made the movie better (esp since they're thinking of making a sequel).\n\n**Overarching themes**\n\n1. Clyde (Butler) should have already distrusted the government. He apparently worked for the CIA and focused on killing people. He must have seen a lot of innocent people getting killed by the us government without any justice being served. It's hard for me to believe seeing a plea deal would have set him off like it did or him not realizing he would have to take matters into this own hand. \n2. Clyde is too hateable as a protaganist and Nick/Foxx is too likeable as an antagonist. \n   1. Nick is not a villain, he's just a cocky DA who cares about his career and made a plea deal. He's not corrupt, he's not actively trying to hurt people, he's genuinely doing what he thinks is the right thing. He even sympathizes with Clyde at the beginning, but knows he has a job to do. If they wanted to make him the villian, they should have made him more corrupt.   \n  \n   2. OTOH, Clyde starts off likeable, but ends just just being a mass murderer with no real plan. I was expecting something much more complicated and nuanced to incite real change. Clyde says he's not just out for vengeance, but to bring the system down. I don't really know how he's doing that or plans to do it. Killing everyone isn't really going to do anything other than have them be replaced with like minded people. I would have personally had Clyde work with the press and have bugs on the govt officials and show how they think they're above the law. For example, I thought he was recording the judge claim how she's a judge and can do whatever she wants...but no he just made her cell phone a killing device lol. \n\n**Plot holes**\n\n1. The robbery itself makes no sense. Two thugs just decide to show up at some random person's house and kill them? Clyde is ex-CIA and did some shady shit. I would expect he would have had some basic home security like a camera and not opening the front door when he's not expecting anyone without checking who's there. Something like how Batman's parents died sounds a bit more plausible vs. what happened here. \n2. It seems like a pretty open and shut case. There's DNA evidence and Clyde was conscious long enough to see what happened. I don't see how someone like that isn't getting more than 5 years and I'm sure that guy had a bunch of priors. \n3. Why does Clyde want to be in jail? What purpose does it serve? He could have just sat in his mission control and killed everyone. Him being in jail just was so he could be amused and see their reactions? For a guy who calculates every more I'm not sure what benefit he got being in jail.\n4. Killing his cell mate was random. He should have at least defended it and said he knew he was a murderer or did something horrible. That other dude could have just been in there for robbery or something. He could have easily gotten sent to solitary confinement without killing someone. \n5. What does Clyde actually want? He's putting the government officials in a lose-lose situation. On one hand if they give him what he wants that's what he's upset about...them making deals with murderers. OTOH if they don't give him what he wants, he kills them. His plan really makes no sense and it made me not really care what happens at the end. \n\nWas still an entertaining movie, but thought there was so much more potential",

There were some really cool shot and the music was great. Especially in the training montage. Jonathan Majors did a SUPERB job. Unfortunately I can't say the same of MBJ's performance. He wasn't terrible, he was busy directing too and there is a large gap to fill without Stallone so I'm gonna cut him some slack. Maybe it was the writing in some scenes i dunno i just wasn't 100% convinced there. I would give this a 8.5/10 though and this trilogy has been so much fun!",

        "text": "There are a number of themes in this movie already that we already know, and acceptance of Joy is there as it is Evelyn's arc, one of many. However, I couldn't help but feel there is another acceptance angle from the other way around, which also adds to Joy deciding to leave the bagel: Joy accepting her mother. I think this is a obvious thing, but no one talks about it which is why I'm asking here. \n\nThroughout the movie, Joy was trying to find an Evelyn who was just like her, and did so with the prime version the film focuses on. But with her rejecting the cynical look at life, Joy decides to kill herself alone, but is saved by her mother. The point behind getting her to reject death is pointing out how despite how there is multiple versions of Joy, Evelyn would always want to be with her. However within that dialogue, Evelyn points out the issues she has with Joy: getting fat, not calling her, etc. Pointing out that those issues are still there, but doesn't change the point of her accepting her daughter. \n\nWhich leads to Joy: how I see it is that, Joy came into grips over the fact that, this is Evelyn, this is her mother, her mother has issues because she is a human being, but this is who she is no matter what, and she cannot escape that, she has to accept it. Which led to her rejecting death.\n\nI know people might roll their eyes saying \"no duh\". Again, no one mentions this, so who knows if I;m right or not.",

This movie had an enormous impact on a lot of people, and everyone else who did understands completely. For those of you who didn't like the movie (inexplicably) please don't comment. Just move along. I want to hear from those who did, and what they felt when they watched it, what their emotional reaction was.\n\nI watched it at home alone but thankfully with a great surround sound system set up. I was drawn in by the cornfield chase, crying by the driving away/launch scene. But after that I just couldn't believe what I was watching, or experiencing. The wormhole scene, the waves scene, the relativity and time dilation, the Cooper messages scene, Dr. Mann risking all of mankind to save his own life, the DOCKING SCENE, the blackhole and tesseract scene, the reunion and ending. It was nothing less than perfect for me, and had me weeping like a child. I couldn't move or talk at least 20 minutes after it ended. I didn't feel \"back to normal\" for at least 3 straight weeks. I started researching black holes, wormholes, space time and relativity, different dimensions, everything. I brought my mom over to watch it and didn't properly warn her about what she was about to experience. She had the same reaction as me. Left weeping, unable to move or talk to me for minutes after the credits rolled, and when she finally could talk about what she'd just experienced it was all through tears. While the movie is not perfect it's few flaws do not change the fact that the Nolans, and composer Zimmerman, and the actors created one of the most exhilarating emotional and affecting movies in the history of film. I'd love to be able to discuss with others their experience of seeing this movie.",

They were all standing but they looked like zombies clapping in unicen, as if they were trying to balance public perception with not pissing off the people who sign their checks.\n\nAnother comment I found in the wild on here mentioned that Fraser said pretty much nobody except Pauly Shore called him to congratulate him on his best actor nomination.\n\nAre they not allowed to show support for fear of retribution from the ~~rapists~~ Hollywood higher-ups?

Never expected killing hopes of living beings jumpscares, I enjoyed (tensely shocked 😭 at night). When I started watching it, I had no expectations as they just have to climb the tower, right? But they showed the theme of the movie \"Survival of the Fittest\" in so a great way that you will just experience the adventure and thrill or probably you will get scared with depressing scenes 🥺😣. Well, the shots are taken in a great style, you can feel depth 😳. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you like watching survival thrilling movies, then this will your great choice 😣.

What happened to him was horrible and he deserves retribution and acting jobs. But is snubbing the other nominated actors the correct course to help Fraser. Yes, I love his early roles in the Mummy, Encino man, and George of the Jungle, but they aren't great performances that deserve Oscars, so he wasn't snubbed back then. I've watched Inkheart and Monkey Bone, in which he gives performances showing he isn't Oscar worthy. Reddit is just full of people congratulating him and stating how much he deserves it, and didn't watch The Whale or his acting. This feels like one of those popularity awards that discredits the Academy like all the awards given to Shakespeare in Love. Anyone else feel like these \"making up for mistakes\" awards just demeans the award and takes away from both the recipient and those that were nominated but didn't win?",

The article author seemed to think that who distributed the movie contributed to the movie's artisticness. Not clear if A24 produced it. I do get that producing could relate to the artisticness of a movie. I'm curious about the distributing. To me distributing doesn't sound like the artistic end of the movie business but the business end, getting the movies into theaters.",

It is weird, it's weird as fuck, but it seems like maybe weird avant-garde film making is back considering a movie about fighting with giant dildos won the award for Best Picture\n\nIt's one of those movies that's so weird and difficult to understand that, by the time you've made it to the end, you've grown as a person. \n\nTL;DR - Swiss Army Man is \"the movie about a farting corpse\" as much as Everything Everywhere All At Once is \"the movie about the fighting dildos.\" It's 100% worth a watch if you liked Daniels' recent film",

        "text": "   There's this horror film that probably came out more than ten years ago. It's about two girls that are students and are traveling on a train if I remember correctly. One owns a necklace that was gifted to her by her grandmother (?) who told her not to ever take it off. The friend of that girl asks to borrow the necklace to wear it just for a bit. After the first friend gives it to her they get into an accident, the train falls off of a bridge. The emergency medics get them both out of the water but they can only save one since they have one oxygen container-tank. The necklace that's on the girl that borrowed it catches his eye and he's drawn to save her. The other girl and original owner of the necklace dies. I think what's next is the original owner haunting the friend to get back what belongs to her and get revenge because she didn't have her necklace at that time and hence died but I'm not sure about the last part. \n   I have been searching for it for so long and asking people about it but nobody seems to know. Does anyone know the title of this film? It might be japanese or korean.",

        "text": "I loved him since George of the Jungle and The Mummy but when he went hiatus, I got curious what happened to him. And then when he appeared in 2017-2018 on the red carpet, some people were bullying his change of physical appearance not knowing what really happened to him.\n\nHim being able to get back to the film industry while staying humble and genuine despite his fallbacks, divorce, his mother's death, Hollywood shitting on him is truly inspiring. I cried watching The Whale and I felt that he was truly dedicated to his performance. And him winning the Oscars prove that you can always get back up in spite of so many relapses in life.\n\nThere were debates as well that Austin Butler should've won instead of Brendan and while I have only watched a few clips of Elvis, I still think Brendan deserves to win not because of his past history but because how he handled his Oscar campaign very well + Brendan's acting on The Whale made almost everyone in the theater crying. Austin's campaign didn't work because he promoted too much of the \"method acting\" thing. Not saying Austin is an awful actor, I just think his team didn't handle it well and his method acting got too out of hand whereas Brendan didn't need to do any sort of method acting and just researched and gave the role justice. \n\nI witnessed Brendan throughout the awards season and boy, he handled it gracefully and genuinely. He was so humble and natural; He didn't need to pretend to be someone else and he even said he isn't expecting to win. And the way he spoke about the people he worked with, he was so shy but genuine. \n\nHis acceptance speech both at SAG and the Oscars made me shed a tear. I love how he didn't expect it and it felt too good to be true for him. And the best part of it is, this is just the beginning of his comeback. \n\nI am rooting for him and his career. He deserves all the best!",
