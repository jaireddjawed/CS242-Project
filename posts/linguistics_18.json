Also, is an AI or a human answering the prior question on ethics?\n\nAI: It is not ethical to deceive someone into thinking that they are having a conversation with an AI when in reality it is a human posing as an AI.

        "text": "Hi! I was wondering something about diphthongs recently. My understanding of diphthongs is that you shift your mouth position from one vowel like **a** into something like **ɪ** (as in **i** th**i**s). Kind of like a consonant cluster for vowels. Although, when looking at the diphthong **aɪ**, the **ɪ** sounds more like an **i**. It's the same thing with the diphthong **aʊ**, the **ʊ** sounds different on its own, but when merged with **a** it becomes like a **u**. I think I'm misunderstanding something about what a diphthong is fundamentally or something",

Fun times :)\n\nMy take is that personal names for humans are (usually) made up by parents and they can be spelled and pronounced however they decide, and that there are no actual grammatical or linguistic rules in play here. In other words: this is separate from other language, and there is no ***correct*** way to spell a personal name, there are just more and less popular variants of names.\n\nAm I wrong here and if so, how or why?",

But in singing (e.g. pop songs) that could conflict with the melody, as would duration. So how is stress apparent in song? For now, I'd say:\n\n• Phrasal stress is usually ignored. \"Will you still love me tomorrow\" and \"Do you really want to hurt me\" are not perceived as having question intonation, but that is not very noticeable.\n\n• Melodies are structured to have higher notes (and sometimes longer notes) on accented syllables. When they don't, words are perceived as having the stress at the wrong place, e.g. in The Sound of Silence: \"People talking with**out** spea**king**, People hearing with**out** liste**ning**...\"\n\nIs there more to it?

We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

Here in Serbia it is well known a decent amount of our words are loan words from Turkish who are themselves often loan words from Persian, a couple of examples are tefter (notebook), sat (hour), boja (color), džep (pocket), komšija (neighbor) etc.\n\nWhat I've recently wondered about is the older words for these objects/concepts. Specifically, and rather funnily, the word for towel, peškir, is the one I'm having lots of trouble with, tefter, boja and others are easy because either their old forms are still present in our language or can be found in Croatian or Russian. Peškir is the one I'm having the most difficulty finding, so of course I turn to the second most depraved site after Twitter. My beloved Reddit.\n\nSo yeah. Help a bro out.",

Wikipedia says that if the juncture is external, then the word boundary is highlighted by a syllable break. What happens if the juncture is internal, though?\n\nI did some research, and it would appear that there's no difference in pronunciation between the two words, when the juncture is internal. Yet, A. C. Gimson, in \"An Introduction to the Pronunciation of English\" (p.300), reads: \"a name (relatively long /n/, associated with stress onset and possible pitch change); an aim (relatively short /n/, stress and pitch change beginning on /eɪ/)\". Could this mean that, in some varieties of English, syntactic gemination exists and it helps differentiate between homophones such as \"a name /ə͜ nˈneɪm/ - an aim /ən 'eɪm/\", or \"a loan /ə͜ lˈloʊn/ - alone /ə'loʊn/\"?",

Now, this is certainly so in all the languages I have learnt myself, but thinking about it, I wonder: What languages (possessing infinitives and/or participles) do you know where either of them is strictly verbal or strictly nominal? \n\nOf course I know that it is also a matter of terminology what to call a \"participle\", a \"verbal noun\" or an \"infinitive\" and that the terminology differs from discipline to discipline just as the use of the actual forms slightly differs from language to language. However, I've always perceived this as the very symptom of the intermediary function various forms called \"participle\", \"converb\" etc. can assume.  \n\n\nLooking forward to your answers :)",
