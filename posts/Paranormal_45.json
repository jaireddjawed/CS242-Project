This was different from the few events of sleep paralysis I have had, because I could move.\n\nDo you think it may be an encounter with this thing or just my brain acting up?

        "text": "TL;DR: worked the night shift and heard footsteps in the aisles that walked right up to me but had no visible source.\n\nFor me, it has to be the night-shift footsteps.\nDuring my time working freight at HD, I frequently spent my lunch at the contractor service desk to read while the rest of the crew played ping-pong or watched movies in the break room. It wouldn’t happen every night, but occasionally I’d hear someone walking in the lumber section.\n\nThe first time was probably the most confusing. Mind you I was about two aisles down to the right and could see all the way to the back wall, (the lumber section is all the way on the left wall of the store) so it struck me as odd that someone had gotten past me without being noticed, but I brushed it off.\n\nI went back to reading but kept my focus mostly on my surroundings. At this point I suspected that I was the target of a prank or something seeing as I was relatively new to the job and a few jokes had already happened. Unfortunately, this was not the case as I heard the footsteps again, this time closer, maybe one aisle to the left. Of course I jump up and get close to the corner of the aisle in front of me hoping to catch the culprit only to hear the footsteps walk right up to the corner of the other aisle and abruptly stop. \n\nI stepped around the corner and found absolutely nobody. With how close the footsteps were, there was no way they could have gone anywhere in the few seconds I took to step out and around into the next aisle. It made me uneasy, but there wasn’t much I could do other than ask the crew if they were messing with me which came back with a unanimous “no” from everyone including the supervisor.\n\nThe night shift wasn’t for me and I only worked it for about two months before switching to day shift, but over those two months I’d say it happened at least twice a week in the same general area of the store, just in different ways each time. Sometimes they’d come right up to me and other times they’d just walk up and down the aisle for a few minutes. Still no explanation and no evidence of anything, but it definitely was not normal.",

On this particular night, she woke me up at 3:13am so I took her out to the front yard. This is when I saw him: a random white man walking down a dirt road with a stroller.\n\nI live on the edge of a suburban community and there are very few houses around. To the left of my house, there is about 15 acres of woods/ empty land / construction. \n\nTo the right, there are about 5 blocks of houses. There are no lights coming from the left side of my house except the Christmas lights coming from my driveway. \n\nBasically I spot him from maybe 50 yards away from my front door. This sounds far but considering my area, he had no business being that close to the driveway. He was walking away from the house and had his back towards me so he shouldn’t have noticed me. He was walking on the side of my house that was near the woods. I was sleepy and confused and all I was trying to do was figure out if there’s a baby in that stroller (and why they’re out here?).\n\nThen, just as my dog starts peeing, the guy suddenly drop both his hands to his sides and turn 90 degrees to face me. I immediately felt chills ALL over my body - the way he turned was so robotic and abrupt and it woke me up immediately. My heart rate was increasing and I felt my throat tighten.\n\nI stopped blinking and froze in space. He’s staring back at me, and no longer holding the stroller. Again his hands are to his sides and he is not moving.\n\nAs SOON as my dog finished her business, I jerked her harness and ran back inside.\n\nI literally have never witnessed anything paranormal and I can’t tell if i was just freaked out by a neighbour or something else. What do you think?",

I worked day, evening and graveyard shift. And for the most part it was pretty normal. It was an old building, so we could here strange noises from time to time. And a few times room alarms in empty rooms would go off. But again, old building and not wellkept. And me, scaring other workes on the graveyardshift by turning on and off the elevator.  \n\n\nBut on my ward, with 8 rooms, we had one room that for the last year or so of operation was pretty strange. All our patients was longterm demetia patients. Most have been there for at least 2-3 years. But in one room we would get patients come and go, patients that did not look all that sick when they came to us. Our other patients did not like that room, always talked about a person in the room when they walked past it. Demetia, yes i know. But they talked as it was the same person. And the room alarm, that went of at all hours of the day when the room was empty. I remembered one night I was working, got an alarm from an other room and walked past that room and could swear I saw someone sitting in a chair. After I worked the alarm from the other room I when back to see, empty. I figured it just must been a shadow from the road or something. Everyone talked about that room. My boss shut that room down for the last 6-7 month we was open.  \n\n\nI will never forget that room. Haunted, just poor maintained building or paranoia from patients and workers. I don´t know. But it sure as hell was weird.",

We were all in my room, and my mums car wasn’t outside. So around 2 hours go by and we’re just all doing normal sleepover things and I see my mums car pull up, it’s around 11pm. My friend and my cousin nudge me and tell me that our mums are back. We all hear the front door open and slam, and my cousins mum laugh loudly. After about half an hour goes by and I wonder why they haven’t came up and spoke to us. It’s also gone very quiet downstairs. So I go down to ‘investigate’. I’m on my own, in the living room and no one’s there. I heard more laughter from outside so I go through the kitchen into the back garden and there’s nobody there, and no sign that anyone has been there. I’m getting a bit confused, so I go out the front door to my mums car to see if anyones there. There’s nobody in the car. At this point I realised somethings wrong and there’s nobody in the house apart from my cousin and my friend. My house has a ring doorbell, so when I run back up stairs my mum calls me and asks me why I went outside. I told her I saw her pull up and heard her come in the house. She’s very confused because she’s still at the party and haven’t left. I put the phone down and we all start panicking. Everybody saw her car pull up and heard the front door and my cousins mum. We get scared and just sit in my room with the door closed. I’m sat with my back facing the door and I see my cousins face drop. I asked her what’s wrong and then I heard shuffling from outside my room. My cousin tells me that she saw something move outside. We end up calling my other friend just to calm ourselves down. Another 3 hours pass without anything else happening and my mum and my cousins mum come back and come into my room. They told us that they never even left the party and they came back in an Uber. My mum didn’t take her car.",

That day I’d been feeling really….awake. I don’t know how to describe it. Alert. Everything was heightened. (Maybe worth adding that I’m on the autism spectrum so do struggle with sensory stuff) but the entire day my mind was so open and it was such an odd sensation. \nMidway through this math class my ears just started ringing and ringing and ringing. It wasn’t like a constant sound it was like an alarm clock. I told my friend I could hear alarms going off and they just told me I’m probably just getting sensory overload from the sound of the classroom, so I got up to tell my teacher I needed to leave and immediately, as soon as I stand up our fire alarm goes off. \nWe all left along with the rest of the school and started leaving the building but we could tell it wasn’t planned because most of the staff in the hallways were running about and we could make out some people yelling \n‘FIND WHERE IT WAS’ \nAnd things along those lines. \nWe were about halfway to our school meeting point but then the alarms shut off. Everyone started cheering and screaming as 12-13 year old’s do, the teachers called them down and started dragging us all back inside, and suddenly, as we’re midway through sitting down in our class, with everyone still making noise, yet another alarm rings. This time it’s going on and off like it’s just one second of the alarm then it stops. The teachers keep us inside because they’ve deemed it as a malfunction. \nThe school later told us that something had gone wrong in the system a they didn’t have enough information to disclose what, but that it wouldn’t happen again. \nTo this day me and my friend joke about it sometimes, neither of us are especial believers in the paranormal, but I’ve wondered ever since wether that was something that I did or if it was coincidence.",

Sometimes you see her lying on her back shaking her leg (like when you tickle her just right), sometimes she is clearly petrified of something I can't see.\n\nOne day she was trying to get my attention, acting like a stranger had just let themselves in. She led me into the hall, tail down (never happens), barked at the bedroom door, then turned and fled back to my partner.\n\nAt that point a very bright orange ball, about the size of a golf ball, floated  through the door and came straight at me, it seemed to notice me and changed direction to avoid hitting me. Its movement was strangely smooth and deliberate.\n\nI saw it clearly with my bear eyes, but luckily also caught it on my phone's camera. We have started filming in our flat a lot. I find myself sat fixated on a dark doorway, window or mirror through a little screen for far too long more and more recently...\n\nWhich brings me to my question. I know it sounds crazy but we have come to the conclusion that there is some kind of portal in our hall. When it's dark you can see eyes, faces, arms, hands, and even entire monsters (for want of a better term). From terrifying ugly demons, to comical cartoonish little goblins... creatures from horror movies are turning up to observe and mess with us. \n\nRooms get really cold and fill with a strange white mist. We hear, see (and get wound up by) doppelgangers in our periphery. Recently our TV and LED strip lights are turning on and off by themselves... We have pretty convincing communication through spirit box type phone aps too.\n\nWhat are portals? Where do they lead to? Are there any rules these things have to obay?

It's just kind of hanging out, moving stuff, and engaging in some general mischief.

When you reach the hallway, you are first met with a brass door\n\nAnyways, we were let in by our friends and we saw a bunch of other students our age in the hallways. Then a friend of mine (same grade but diff class) said she saw that in one of the classrooms, four beings were at the 4 corners of the ceiling. I thought she was lying but she ran to the closest teacher she could find and told the whole story. Then the entire class ( the same class as the friend from the same grade and diff class) said they saw it to.\n\nFinally they told a diff teacher(she was a crazy one no joke, got a ton of stories about weird teachers from that school but it needs a whole new post) and she said we will go and check. AND NO JOKE, that was the last time anyone has ever saw her. She was absent for a bit and left the school entirely. The thing is, right after my friend told me this, I immediately bolted into the one of the classrooms and saw nothing. So is this a case of mass hysteria?Paranormal? or were they just playin?",

After awhile and getting mad at them, I found out they were using it to drive to a place for rituals and used one of my items to capture a spirit. I can’t quite remember what item it was but I remember it being covered in wax and whatnot. I then woke up. When I eventually fell back asleep, I was trying to figure out what to do with my car and possibly haunted item. It didn’t last long as I woke up again, but I have never had a continuation of a dream.\n\nI haven’t been watching/reading or doing anything related to paranormal in awhile. So I’m positive this isn’t brought on by something in my everyday life.

        "text": "The weeks leading up to my Mom’s death who died painfully over a couple months due to ovarian cancer that rapidly spread. Sadly, she had been doing chemo for about 4 months before then but it didn’t work, possibly because she was allergic to one of the most effective types of treatment unfortunately. In the house, lights flickered, objects fell, doors slammed by themselves, bangs could be heard randomly. \n\nI assumed this may have been due to changes in the weather/pressure in the air since there was a hurricane around this time. I also had a devastating migraine after the hurricane which is unusual since I usually get them before or during, unrelated but anyways. One of my friends was visiting and joked that the house was haunted since what I described also happened when she was visiting. \n\nOften it felt like someone was in the room with me when I was alone, nothing malicious, similar to when you have a family member in the same space and you’re both reading quietly or something. One night, I had a dream of my grandmother and woke up to the sensation of someone gently petting my hair (which she used to do as a child either before I went to sleep or to wake me up from sleep). The sensation felt “real” and not part of the dream. \n\nA few days before mothers death, a black kitten wandered into the  road as dad and I drove home from hospice. He crossed in front of the car and stared and sat in the middle of the road. I begged dad to stop (I’m the “tender hearted” one of the family when it comes to animals) he refused but slowed down. A car on the opposite side thankfully stopped and got the kitten. This was not long before Halloween but it was an interesting omen if you believe in that.\n\nWhenever I used to park the car in our driveway, I would usually sit there for a few minutes, gathering my belongings, checking my phone, or finishing the song I was listening to and being an oblivious person at times, my Mom enjoyed sneaking up and startling me by tapping on the windows with her acrylic nails. \n\nA couple days after she passed, I heard the distinct tap-tap-tap on the window from her acrylic nails next to me. For a moment, I looked up expecting to see her and saw no one. I got out of the car, looking around expecting maybe a neighbor or tree branches to make that sound, but there was nothing around. \n\nDuring her funeral, when people were speaking, sharing stories at the podium, the lights had flickered and one changed color multiple times. I didn’t notice this, but multiple people shared this with me, separately to me privately. \n\nAside from the funeral and the acrylic nails incident, all of the weird little things I described stopped after her death (mid-October of this year) I’ve always been a little skeptical of the paranormal and this is all rather mundane but thought I’d share. I’m still unsure what to believe but wanted to hear people’s thoughts. \n\nAlso, I was unsure what to flair this since what I described could fall under multiple categories.",

        "text": "The summer holidays at grandma's place were traumatizing more than it is scary. The second night with my sister came with a bunch of creepy instances. Now, guys, it took a total of two weeks for us to adjust to the house's 'hauntedness'. How my grandmother lives in that house alone is beyond me but somehow I understand her affliction towards it. \n\nAny sane person would move out of the place or at least that room after a harrowing experience like that. But the discussion with my sister that followed the next day forced me to retreat into my room. As I mentioned in part 1, my grandma had a very creepy habit of roaming around the house at night. According to my sister, the previous night when the clock chimed twice, my grandma got up with a blanket over her head. My sister is a very light sleeper. A pin drop could wake her up and her guard is always up. She woke as soon as my grandma forced herself off the bed. My sister called to my Ammamma (grandma in my language) but she didn't heed, instead, she slowly walked out of the bedroom into the living room, walked around the house, and sat in an armchair in the living room. The armchair is placed exactly opposite my sister's bedroom door. She watched as my grandma unblinkingly stared out the living room window and fell asleep somewhere during the night. In the morning, when we confronted Ammamma , she said she likes to sit in her armchair when she can't sleep at night. My sister's recollections of that night put me on edge. \n\nThe thing is guys, at this point, even the smallest abnormal thing could have alarmed us. We were very much tuned into everything around the place, tiny bumps and kicks scared us. My sister and I, weren't, what you call, 'brave' people. I simply didn't care about the paranormal before, and hence did not pay attention to any of it until that night. My sister, as I said, was a very guarded person. She hates the dark and wouldn't take the effort to investigate a random sound because according to her, that's what gets you killed in horror movies. And I agreed. \n\nWe tried talking to my parents. My dad, who is a very spiritual guy, explained to both of us that nothing unearthly can hurt us. He proceeded to explain how certain houses can attract certain types of energy and the only way to fight it is simply through a state of mind. And honestly, at that point, I didn't understand jack-shit about what he said. But the baseline was that they refused to pick us up. Apparently, it was important for my dad for both of us to be brave because in his words 'Once you run, you always end up running.' \n\nSo my sister and I decided it was time to buck up. After the talk with my dad, my sister and I came to the conclusion that we should see what my grandma does at night and I also wanted to see the whole thing in person. That night, we kept our door unlocked, when the needle hit 2, two chimes echoed through the walls, and minutes later heard shuffling from the living room. We quietly waited, trying to hold on to the bit of courage that our dad imparted. I tiptoed out of the room with my sister right behind me. My grandma was sitting in her armchair looking outside the window. The tiny light outside illuminated her face, her eyes were clearly open. \n\n'Ammamma?'\n\nI called out to her quietly but she seemed oblivious to our existence. The whole thing looked eery. At this point, I was like, 'fuck it! imma see what's going on.' (kids, that's how people get killed) I cautiously walked towards her, placed my hand on her shoulders, and shook her lightly.\n\n'Ammammaa?'\n\nAs soon as I called her, her head drooped down forward, like she fell asleep. My sister reached for her blanket and called her a bit more loudly. At this point, guys, something changed. It was like an icy-hot stone fell into my stomach, I knew something was wrong. My grandma's head which was drooped down to her neck slowly moved sideways like someone was pulling it to the side, holding her chin. She looked right at us but there was nothing in her eyes. The light illuminating half her face reflected dead eyes and her lips were half open, white and dry. And a tiny struggle of a voice came from her throat but seemed like it got caught in mid-way. The next thing I know, my sister and I are locking ourselves in our room. We stayed inside until dawn. In the morning, when we confronted my grandma, she looked clueless. She didn't even see us last night. I was shocked and scared.   \nThat was the last night of hands-on investigation. We never got out of our room at night after that incident. And I know most of you are going to say that she must have been sleepwalking or maybe its sun-down syndrome. I looked at everything for a rational explanation after I came back home. And maybe it is sun-down syndrome but what really got to me was the feeling. As soon as my sister called her, I knew something was wrong. I hated the unnaturalness of it. Being scared is one thing but that feeling like you are intruding into something private is a totally different thing. \n\nWe didn't mention any of this to my parents. But what we did was find out about the history of the house and boy, was it bad! I can do a part 3 explaining the history of the house if you guys are interested. Let me know what you think!",

        "text": "I posted yesterday about the “talking baby”, and it reminded me of another incident.\n\nYears ago, my then fiancée and I rented a condo to be near my grandmother. She lived in the same development.\n\nThe person who rented before us left in a hurry. There was still food in the fridge, and plants that were droopy but still alive! We had agreed to take it “as is”.\n\nWe were just moving in and I didn’t have all the kitchen stuff unpacked, so on the way home from work I stopped at a local diner to get takeout.\n\nI get home, open the front door, and all of our furniture was upside down in the middle of the room. The couch was teetering on its back, and **all** of our artwork was off the walls and in the pile.\n\nMy first thought was that the previous tenant still had a key and was somehow trying to rob us. I left immediately, and sat outside waiting waiting for fiancée to get home. He was as baffled as I was, but we decided to just put everything back and change the locks in the morning. \n\nWe hung all the pictures. Some were big and needed both of us to hold. \n\nOk - we sit down to finally eat, and of course we’re trying to figure out what happened. I casually ask if he thinks it was something paranormal, and not the last tenant. He slaps down his hand and says “There’s no such thing as ghosts.”\n\nA little later I get up to use the bathroom. As I pass our bedroom I see all the pictures off the wall, upside down on the bed. We just hung them!!! Talk about goosebumps!\n\nI don’t think I even made it to the bathroom. I came out, grabbed his hand, and we ran!\n\nWe drove around until we found a church. We found one, and went back the next day. We found a priest who was willing to come out and bless the place. When he came, he asked if we wanted to be in the house with him. Uhhh nope. But we did have a neighbor who wanted to see what was going to happen, so she went with him.\n\nThere was nothing out of the ordinary, and I was starting to feel silly for getting him involved. Then he hit the bedroom. It was like a mini whirlwind. Literally, his candle went out, and his clothes were flapping in the wind.\nNeighbor runs out and leaves him alone. We were watching this through the windows, as this was a first floor unit. Then she tells us that she’s had issues as well, and would I mind if the priest went to her place next.\n\nThe priest said to keep an eye on things, and if we were still having issues, he’d come back.\n\nWell, I wouldn’t know because we didn’t go back until we had a bunch of people with us to help pack and move (we didn’t leave the plants behind).\n\nI should have known something was wrong because my dog wouldn’t set foot in the place. If I had him on a leash and brought him inside, he would just sit by the door and whine. At the time I thought he was just weirded out with a new environment.\n\nSurprisingly, the realtor had no problem letting us out of the lease and returning our security - almost like they were expecting it!",

I immediately froze and didn’t want to look. \n\nThe window is about 10 feet above ground and faces a creek and a ravine. It is also pitch black as there’s no light. It’s not really accessible since it’s not cleared and there’s so many branches and trees. So I know it definitely wasn’t a person knocking. We never close the blinds so whatever was out there could see in and I couldn’t see out. \n\nMy dog was barking and getting in defense mode (he’s 25 pounds and can’t really protect me but I appreciate the effort). I just sat on the couch and continued watching tv. I ignored the knocks. I couldn’t go upstairs to sleep because I wanted to make sure nothing strange would happen downstairs. \n\nI’m internally freaking out.  What should I do?",

        "text": " \n\nI know this story sounds extremely made-up and it happened quite some time ago so I do not remember specific details. But please believe me when I say this truly happened to me.\n\nThis happened when I was around 14 years old. My grandma would visit us every summer since my mom would spend a few months overseas with her family. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, it was just another day for me and I fell asleep like I usually did.\n\nThis is important: My room has thin wooden panels outlining the ceiling. They are held up by a few screws each. One of these panels being exactly above my bed. I usually keep my door open at night when my grandma is visiting since she sleeps in the living room and I know this sounds dumb but I was still scared of the dark back then.\n\nThat night I woke up hearing loud footsteps. It was a school day and my grandma would always wake up early so it wasn't unusual if she came into my room. What was confusing, though, was that it was still dark. And normally on a summer morning, my room would have already been bright. Now please keep in mind that I was facing the wall. So I didn't immediately assume something was going on. I was kind of annoyed because it was still really early so I called out to her, asking what the matter was. I didn't get a reply. I knew her hearing wasn't that great so I assumed she didn't hear me. But then I heard snoring from the living room. I swear, I have never been as scared in my life as I was in that moment.\n\nIt was a dumb move but I guess I was just so frightened that I immediately turned around as if on instinct. When I turned around I saw something small, dark/shadowy running away from me. And actually Immediately after, I heard loud creaking and the wooden panel fell right on my bed, a few centimeters from where I was laying. I was so in shock at that moment that I remember thinking, did I hallucinate? And for a few weeks I thought I did. The panel got fixed and my parents asked me what had happened so I told them. To my surprise they actually believed me right away. Turns out they've experienced quite some paranormal stuff very frequently whereas I had only seen something twice in my life. My dad had also told me, that he re-called feeling a child's hand on multiple occasions at night, along with a reassuring feeling. So was this a good spirit?\n\n**I have two theories:** Either the spirit knew something was loose and tried to warn me or it caused its fall and got caught in the act.\n\nTo this day, I'd like to believe it was protecting me, but I can never know for sure. Does anyone know what this could have been? Or if you have experienced something similar?",

        "text": "So I live on the second story of a two bedroom house. Been living here for 8 months and I’ve never once heard of anything weird at night. But at literally 3:05am (checked my phone when I woke up because I never wake up at night) there were some constant, in a row, tapping noises coming from a glass window on the second floor. Honestly I can’t sleep in the dark so I have a small light that is always on away from the window. Also the window has blinds that cover it which are closed and a curtain so the light doesn’t even peak through. It’s 3:42am and my roommates dog wakes up, looks at me, licks me, and then laid back down to go to sleep. I’m assuming if any energy good or bad was around the dog would bark or stay up but no he just laid back down. What’s crazy is that the knocking is every now and then, I’m talking 5 min intervals to 2 min intervals but are persistent. I’m not willing to look outside the window because it’s weird, it’s a hard tap almost like a giant nail is tapping on the glass with intent. Personally I’m not religious but I do believe in energies. \n\nAnyway, I tried looking this scenario up with a lot of keywords I would use and even did a Reddit search. Nothing seemed to fit the picture. I haven’t been to any locations that would evoke weird energy or energy at all and have been home for a large portion of this week. I am curious to know what it could be, maybe an insect but yet I’m not really curious to see anything out of this world by using a camera system. Just looking to see if anyone else experienced this.\n\nAlso keep in mind there are literally no trees or branches near the window, it’s just roofing. The house is old and it was built in the 70’s so there’s some weird architecture. Also there’s no wind as far as I can hear. Any insight/relation is appreciated, keep in mind this is my first time posting on this sub, thanks!",

Newly built modern shared living space, I got myself a room with an attached bathroom. \n\nIn the three months that I've moved in, I've had to replace no less than 03 filament lamps, one indoor CFL lamp, and one fluorescent lamp (yes, we still use them here in my country). The brand-new one that I put in two days back started flickering yesterday. \n\nBefore you think it's faulty wiring, it's not. The house itself is less than 10 years old; it is in perfect condition. Before I moved in, I requested my landlord that I'll be needing my own electricity meter -- shared bills can be a female canine. He responded well and used it as an opportunity to find out who among his tenants was hogging electricity. As a result, I've got myself a sweet deal. Also, none of the other tenants experiences this problem.\n\nWhy does this belong on the paranormal board? That's because I've noticed that the days of electrical failures are strangely correlated with the days I'm experiencing real sh!t in my life. Do you know those days when it just seems that the universe wants to feck you in particular? Well, turns out that these days correlate a lot with these electrical antics. \n\nIs it just me, or is anyone else having the same experience?",

It was all black but looked like he was made of static, with little black sparks flying off him.

I think I remember screaming but as quick as it showed up it went away. I've always felt like it was related to the hostility in my house, but I understand it could be stress related or have to do with a sleep disorder. It's just this feeling that maybe something was drawn to all the bad energy there. Does anyone else have experience with that?",

When they said he named it I immediately knew that’s just something you don’t do, I felt it was giving power to it. That night for the first time I seen him up close, this time with glowing purple eyes. He was right at the foot of the couch I was sleeping on. I thought it was just a nightmare/sleep paralysis. But when I told my mom and brother the next day, they said they seen the same thing. I moved out later that year, but over the years my brother said he still seen him around. One day I was vacuuming the stairs for my mom, and out of my peripherals, it passed through the upstairs hallway right in front of me. I’m not realizing it started getting closer and developed eyes after giving it a name. Does anyone have any experience with shadow people and know any information on them? Specifically one with purple eyes? I’ve only heard of red or yellow? \n\nI started doing a little more research because we started experiencing something at my friends house in CT. One of my friends has been told it’s following him around. I seen it right in front of me as I was about to enter a dark room where it mainly resides in. We’re not too sure what this entity is yet, and working  to make sure our friend isn’t hexed",

There was no door on the bedroom and the lights were on in the hallway so you could see clearly with the light in the doorway. Now I have slept there many times and there was no light shining from where I was at to have made a shadow cast this way, it also appears 3 dimensional. It was tall though peeking around from near the top of door way around 6’9 if I were to guess. But the head was peeping around perpendicular from the doorframe and two big hands came around the frame too. It looked as if it was someone doing a pull up and looking over a ledge only sideways. I stared at it for what felt like 20 min in complete fear. I thought I’ve seen things before and creeped out as I may have been I wasn’t so afraid to not get up and check it out to see what it might have been, but this was different. There was a paralyzing fear. All I could end up doing was lie down and keep it out of view and pretend like I was perfectly fine to sleep. Which I didn’t",

        "text": "Ok so this really freaked me out, and I've come here for some information on what could have possibly happened.\n\nLast night I heard my son let out a cry, and I looked towards the baby monitor, hoping that he was just stirring and would go back to sleep.\nHe suddenly sat up in his cot. And three little white wisps things moved past the screen, one after the other. They moved quick but not super fast, and in the same direction, but each were slightly in a different place below the other. \n\nMy son then stared at the corner of the room, the same direction the wisps flew towards. If you knew my hyperactive son, you'd know that he DOES NOT sit still. He has to constantly move. And here he was, sat completely still, his eyes wide open, staring into the corner.\n\nHe stared for about 5 mins and didn't move an inch, didn't make a sound. Then layed back down and went to sleep.\n\nI was so creeped out, as my husband and I are temporarily separated, and I was all alone in the house.\n\n\nWhat could those wisps have been?!",

        "text": "So last night I was outside at around 9:30pm digging up some mushrooms that I didn’t know much about so that the wild rabbits in the area wouldn’t eat them since they were near where we threw food scraps. I didn’t have a flashlight or anything because the street lights were *just* bright enough that I could make out what I was doing. This is kinda important for later in a way.\n\nI looked up because I heard a noise and right now I don’t even remember what the noise was. All I know is that my eyes made out what looked like a shitty Flipnote Studio animation of a stick figure with no head (it just went up in a straight line and ended) fucking BOOKING it across my street. It looked like, height-wise, it was exactly half of the height of the closest street lamp which was mounted to a standard electrical pole.\n\nY’know when you’ve been staring at a very bright light source for a while, and then when you look away or blink, you see the outline of that light kind of imprinted on your eyes for a bit? Like whatever shape the light was is dark, and then it has a sort of fuzzy gray haze around it. This is EXACTLY what the stupid stick thing looked like, dark with the hazy gray outline, except it was moving. It was over so fast and I even blinked a few times to try and “see it again” because I genuinely thought that it was just that effect in my eyes. But I hadn’t been using any flashlights and the street light has a round cloudy cover around the bulb so I couldn’t have even seen the light bulb itself in any way.\n\nI’m still not incredibly sure that this wasn’t my eyes playing tricks on me, in fact I’m really only about 60% sure that it was real. I’m just posting to share and see if anyone else has seen something similar. At least in the moment, it was so scary to me and I was so convinced that I’d seen it that I literally started crying back inside. I’m possibly being over dramatic, I just had no explanation",

The sister of my grandpa is married. Her husband died recently because of his age.. I only met him a few times when I was very little and never knew his family. One day before his funeral I had a dream.. a woman came to me and said that she will be at his funeral. She was expecting him and is guiding him to the other side. I should remember that I met her and tell the family that he is fine. I asked who she was and she said : his mother. Then I asked for her name and she said: Anna. After that my dream ended. Again: I never knew his family at all. And when I met him I was only 7 years old. I told my mother about the dream and asked her if she knows the name of his mother. She had no idea but she asked me what her name was in my dream and she said that we are going to find out if her name is really Anna. So I went to the funeral today.. I was afraid to randomly ask such a question so i didn‘t..but my mother did… and guess what… her name was Anna. She died before I was even alive… I told the family and we were all shocked but they were thankful that I did tell them.. this happend today so I am still in disbelieve.. but now I am sure there is something after we die..",

        "text": "I don't really know where this story belongs, so I'm just posting it here because it seemed to fit. \n\nThis happened about a month ago, I'm a teenager. \n\nOne night, I found myself having an extremely vivid and lucid dream. I can't really explain it, but it was super vivid. Everything in it just seemed real and 3D, and when I woke up I thought it had actually happened for a second. Let me tell you what this dream was about; \n\nI had a dream (first dream) that my ex attempted to get back with me by coming into my apartment when my dad wasn't home and wrapping his arms around me and telling me how much he missed me. I had to hide out in my room until he left. I'm not exactly sure why I had a dream about him since it has been well over a year and a half since him and I dated, and we only really dated for a few short months before we mutually ended things. \n\nBut, what was weird was that the next day, I went to school and he was wearing the exact same outfit I saw him wearing in my dream. Same shoes, same sweat shirt, same pants, etc. He looked exactly the same. It struck me odd but I thought nothing of it until that night when I had another dream. \n\nMy second dream was a bit more elaborate; it started with me in a popular mall in my city that lots of people go to, especially the kids at my school, and I was there late at night with my boyfriend and his friends. \nWe walked around for a while and inspected Spirit Halloween, Spencer's, Hot Topic, all the emo looking stores. When we walked into an unrecognizable store that looked to be a combination of those three stores, I ran into a friend of mine from school. Let's call her O. \n\nThe next day I woke up and it was a Saturday night, so I stayed at home, watched a few movies, and did what ever. I found out later that night that my boyfriend was going out with his friends on a drive, and they ended up going to the mall. I didnr tell my boyfriend abouy my dream since i felt no need to. My dream was completely random it seemed. Until then, anyway. \n\nI called my best friend while my boyfriend was at the mall and told her that mh dream came true again, to which she asked me to describe the dream. I told her about it, and she told me that O, the friend from my dream, was at the mall in Spirit Halloween that day. \n\nRightfully freaked out, I immediately started feeling a sense of dread. I didnt understand why my dreams were coming true, especially on this level. It may have just been a weird coincidence, but my dreams had never been this vivid before. \n\nThat night, I went to sleep at my usual time and that was the end of my dreams predicting things. I had a dream I got hit by a car that night, but nothing has happened since. \n\nIdk if this is even paranormal, but maybe it belongs here..?",

        "text": " I'm writing this because I've experienced this phenomenon more than once, and it has some particularities that seem to be a pattern. Usually I don't give too much thought to any paranormal or difficult to explain phenomenon.\n\nThe phenomenon in question here is waking up in your dimly lit room and seeing an arachnid on the wall or hanging by a single thread of webbing above you, said arachnid is behaving like any regular insect. But the moment you really focus on it and try to figure out what it is it crumpleas away in a vibratory fit, almost like it vibrates out of existence. This phenomenon has happened to me more than a handful of times and has left me puzzled and inquisitive.\n\nMind you, I am an Internal Medical Physician by trade so I know all about Hypnopompic and Hypnagogic hallucinations. Of Course these are the Hallucinatory musings of your brain that can mix with your everyday waking reality as you go to sleep or just wake up from sleep.\n\nExperts aren’t entirely sure what causes hypnagogic hallucinations. Neurologically, hypnagogic hallucinations appear to share some similarities with both daytime hallucinations and dreams. Researchers once hypothesized that hypnagogic hallucinations resulted from REM sleep patterns intruding during awakened moments, but research hasn’t substantiated this idea. In short, we dont know what these hallucinations are but we have a name for them.\n\nIve had patients complain of both these types of hallucinations and they have never even once described anything similar. Whenever i have experienced these there has been some turmoil with someone i know or something in my life. Another interesting fact is the life like behavior of these \"creatures'' and their awareness of being watched (which is what prompted me to write this post).The last time i experienced it i purposely barely opened my eyes when i saw \"it\" and it was hanging by a single thread above me moving its legs in a weaving motion, like a regular spider would. I then opened my eyes fully and fully focused on it, what followed was wild; it crumpled in on itself like a dying insect and vibrated out of existence. I was fully awake \"not half asleep\" and hallucinating. When i say vibrated i mean it literally, this thing vibrated while blurring out of reality.\n\nThere's almost no information on this online. What are these creatures or entities ? The experience has not varied or changed whenever I have experienced it. Are these interdimensional entities? Watchers? Ghosts perhaps? It seems to me that there is a realm of existence that we cant fully access another layer of reality that is not viewable with our current senses, but that reality has access to our reality and keeps a vigilant eye on us.\n\nThe Hopi Natives speak of a Spider Grandmother who, conscientiously weaving her webs, thought the world itself into existence. Maybe just maybe they were onto something.",

        "text": "My grandma is around 75 years of age. She lives alone and prefers being a recluse. The house she lives in has been the subject of discussion for many moons. Creepy stories, supernatural stuff, and that sort of stuff have always been exchanged during family gatherings. And my mother and her siblings had tried to get her out of the house and move in with one of us many times but to no avail. She simply likes to be left alone.\n\nSo at this point, I am around 15 years old. My father never let me or my siblings stay away for longer than a day. We saw our grandma at least once a month because my dad enjoys long drives. But we always return by nightfall. So my grandma always complains that she never gets time with us because all of my other cousins stay with her during summer (mostly because they live nearby and hence have stories about the house).\n\nSo when I turned 15, my dad had an epiphany. He says it will be good for me and my younger sibling to stay with my grandma for a few days. Now the stories we have heard are kind of scary so my younger sister who is afraid of the dark wasn’t looking forward to it that much. But I convince her it was all fake and that if the house was haunted, my grandma wouldn’t have been able to live in that place for so long. She is not completely convinced but she agrees.\n\nOn the other hand, I was really looking forward to it. I had all the freedom to call my friends at night and nobody would say anything. And when it comes to ghosts, I simply didn’t believe they existed. I come from a family of strong theists. I believed in a God who would protect me and that blind belief rendered me oblivious to supernatural demons and whatnot.\n\nSo my sister and I go to her place. Now there are three bedrooms in the whole house. One is where my grandma sleeps (it has two beds), one is where my grandpa used to sleep and one is known to be the most haunted room out of all. My grandpa’s room had his stuff on the bed so my choices were to sleep in grandma’s room or the haunted room. I picked the haunted one easily. Not because I was brave but because it was private and I could talk to my friends at night. My sister said she would sleep with my grandma.\n\nThe first day was fine. I didn’t get much sleep that night in fact I slept early in the morning because it was impossible for me to sleep in that room for whatever reason. Now the thing about that room is the windows are all wooden so not even a bit of light would get in (in the morning nor at night). The third day my sister says she is going to start sleeping with me cause my grandma apparently had a creepy habit of walking around the house in the middle of the night. (I know. That is a definite 🚩)\n\nSo fourth day (the main incident), my sister and I are together in bed. At around 2, I hear the pendulum clock ringing through the house. I know my grandma is up cause I hear shuffling outside the room. My sister is asleep beside me. It was pitch dark in the room and I wasn’t particularly afraid. I was just randomly thinking about stuff about my teenage drama. I’m facing upwards looking into the dark and one of my hands is hanging out of the bed above my head. Our bed didn’t have a headboard but had a wood covering on the top and bottom.\n\nSo I’m in my own head and my train of thought gets broken by something hitting behind my bed. Like somebody knocked on it once. I freeze and my mind is racing. So I think it was me. My hand is still hanging back. I must have jerked it unconsciously. So I stay like that aware of my hands still hanging back. My sister is still sleeping beside me. A few seconds later, again a huge knock, this time a bit more loudly and strongly. Now guys, at this point I’m officially scared. I slowly pull my hands down. It was pitch dark and I couldn’t get a single word out of my mouth to call my sister. I pull my hands down and I touch my sister’s hand and I squeeze it. And this is no joke, my sister jerks herself away doesn’t even ask me what’s wrong, and starts chanting mantras my dad taught us. I join her and a few seconds later, a lighter knock behind the bed, this time both of us hear it. We hug each other too scared to do anything and continue praying. When dawn broke and my grandma was officially awake, we switched on the light and checked the entire room for rats or holes that rats can come in. And nothing. There was nothing behind the bed or beneath it. My grandma was a clean freak. There will never be a rat in the house anyways. I go back to bed and fall asleep. We don’t say anything to anyone. We called our parents to bring us back but they weren’t home and my dad told us to buck up. We continued to live in that house in that room for a month. In fact, we barely got out of the room. I don’t know why. By the end of the month, we got attached to the room and the house. A lot of creepy and scary things followed that week but dad said to buck up so we bucked up.\n\nWe went back home after a month and told my mom about everything that happened. It was after I left that room and that house that I realized I felt lighter doing so. My aunts after hearing our stories screamed at my mum for letting us stay there for so long. Apparently, my uncle went crazy in that room. He shut off all the ventilators and made sure no light came in and locked himself in the room for months. My family had to sign him to an asylum. It took years of recovery to get him out of his own head. After that, we never stayed there alone.\n\nBut that said, my sister and I stopped being afraid of the house after a whole month. When we go back, there is a sort of welcoming vibe. It’s like we made peace with the contents of the house whatever it was. But I will never forget what happened that month. If you want to hear more about what happened. I can do a part 2.",

        "text": "So long story short me and a few buddies went to the Dejarnette mental assylum. I have been before with another friend which we both had an abnormal experience, nothing really happened after that didn’t think much of it other than it being a cool experience. We’d been there a few hours now all about to leave since we thought we’d explored the whole place. We go outside and to leave but we took the long way around the building and see a back room where it lead to a kitchen and freezer which I hadn’t seen before. I walk in first I see a chair with two perfectly intact watches not a single piece of dust on them (place is a wreck) as smart as we are we took them home. This is when the weird shit started happening and it very well might be me and my friends all developing schizophrenia at the same time. Just to list off a few of the daily occurrences we’ve been having.\nAlways feel like we’re being watched, scratching at the door at least once a day between the 3 of us, banging across the house always after 12:00am, claims of seeing very tall lenky shadowy figures across properties late at night(all gives some descriptions), feel insanely uncomfortable when facing any mirrors, room gets trashed when I’m gone, if we go away for more than a day the watch always turns up in a pocket or bag, the forest will be dead fucking silent at night no crickets or chirps just silence when rustles, I swear I see the time on the watch just start spinning always getting set back to the time I found it at. 11:45 idk are me and my friends just dumb or is there something going on lol.",

Didn’t feel any negative energy or anything.  \n\nBut it’s nearly 4am, i was brushing my teeth standing about 6 inches from the shower curtain. I felt something brush against my leg, so i looked down thinking it was my cat, but it wasn’t. I also saw the lower part of the shower curtain moving (as if something brushed against it), turned around and the door was closed, so it definitely wasn’t any animal of mine. It was for sure an animal, like how cats brush up against your legs. \n\nThere’s about 40 years of dead family cats and dogs buried in the backyard (maybe about 12 of them), so if anything paranormal, i feel like it was one of them just wanting some attention? But I’ve never had any experience like this lol and it kinda freaked me out",

I woke up completely normal and was facing the other side of where the 'creature' was sitting. I had a very eery feeling someone was watching me and I could feel the edge of the bed kind of crinkled like someone was sitting on it. I turned around and was TERRIFIED. I mean I almost shit myself. There was a woman (pretty) with super duper pale skin and bright red lipstick on SMILING with her mouth closed and she was sitting on the edge of the bed but she was turned towards me with her hands on the bed idk how to explain it.She had a super big smile it didn't look human. Her eyes however weren't smiling and looked really intense and focused. She had dark black hair styled up kind of like a pinup girl and was emitting BRIGHT light. I turned around and gasped like a mofocka I thought I was gonna die, and she disappeared. I know it wasn't my brain creating this ! It was way too real and the fact that even before turning around I felt the bed crinkled up and could FEEL someone was watching me. Do you guys think this was a ghost? And have you had these types of experiences before?",

        "text": "I 19F have had this dark shadowy figure following me since I was around five years old. To give an idea this figure stands around 7ish feet tall, complete black shadow, wears a top hat, and has red glowing eyes. The first time I saw the figure (roughly five yo) I had woken up in the middle of the night and had to use the restroom. To give another visual to the right of my room was the kitchen and front door of the house. To the left was my bathroom. I got up to use the restroom and as I walked out my door I saw the figure standing at the front door looking at me. Instead of running back to my room I ran to the bathroom where I stayed for about an hour before getting the courage to run to my room. For context I had a rough childhood and kept most things to myself. I rarely asked for help or talked about my feelings because I felt like a burden. So I never told anyone about what I saw. From there not much happened for a few years. At around 12 years old my family bought a new house. Everything was great for the first two months. But the occasion I’m about to share happened not once but twice. And each time was the EXACT same thing. One morning I had been laying in bed not yet awake when my sister comes bursting into my room and slams the door shut behind her. I of course was already really shaken because I had been asleep. She proceeded to tell me that someone was in the house. She never saw anyone but could hear foot steps all over the house. Our house has an extremely distinctive floor creak as the house was built ages ago. I told her to be quiet so I could listen. And the moment I heard the footsteps every hair on my body stood up and I’ll never forget the chills that came upon me. I grabbed a hunting knife I always kept by my bed side and pushed by back against the door. We sat there in so much fear as we heard the foot steps coming towards us. We hear the bathroom door open, the light turn on, and the sink cabinet open(which also has a distinctive creak). After that it was dead silent. We waiting for what seemed like forever before calling out grandpa to check the house. I (being the stupid 12 yo I was) yelled out asking who was there. Silence. Grandpa came and checked every room. No one was there. Every door and window were closed and locked. Again this happened twice within a few months of each other. And then a few years go by without anything. The fall after I turned 18 I moved out and started dating this guy I met that lived near me. One night leaving his house I saw it again. For the first time in nearly 13 years. I was driving down the same roads I had every night leaving his house. Suddenly the same figure appeared directly in front of my truck. It all happened so fast but I remember how clearly I saw it. How it looked at me for a split second before vanishing right as my truck would have made contact. I called them boyfriend sobbing in a full blown panic attack. This was the first time I ever told someone about the figure and I was so scared he wouldn’t believe me. However he decided to actually do some research on it to hopefully bring me some peace. I decided to do the same and I came across a Sam and Colby video. If you follow Sam and Colby you know about their friend Cory. Cory explains in multiple videos about the figure that has followed and tormented him since he was a child. When he described the same figure I saw my heart dropped. I have heard about the shadowman previously as I’ve always been interested in the paranormal. And it never clicked with me until someone else described the similar experience. Since then I have seen the figure on a regular basis. Then boyfriend decided to investigate. However boyfriend was a very confrontational person. He pulled out an actual spirit box and with every question he asked he got a response almost immediately. \n“Are you here to protect or scare (my name)”\n-“Neither”\n“Are you attached to (my name)”\n-“Yes”\n“Are you the figure (my name) saw as a child”\n-“Yes”\nThis whole time I had been begging him stop stop as I already knew what it was and didn’t want to hear it. I was curled up in a ball under the covers sobbing and praying. \n\nAs I said I have been seeing the figure on a regular basis and it still never fails to scare me. Please if anyone made it this far into my story and has any suggestions as to ways I can try to get rid of it or at least calm the sightings please let me know. I know this all might sound made up but I swear on my grandmothers grave everything is true and I just want it to end.",

        "text": "     In 2018 I saw a tall, skinny, black humanoid with long arms and legs sprint across my lawn. This was in broad daylight at 4PM, and it wasn’t something I saw out of the corner of my eye. I was completely calm and relaxed, and I was on the phone with my friend when it appeared. I was terrified, but I perfectly tracked it running from left to right across the grass. \n    Despite it being so bright out, its body was completely pitch black and featureless. It had no face that I could see, but it’s arms and legs were very long and lanky. I could tell it was about 8-12 feet tall, because it was several feet taller than the stop sign it ran past. It was extraordinarily fast, moving about 45 MPH. \n     I never saw it again, but at some point later I brought up the story to my mom. She looked shocked as she explained that she had seen the exact same creature. That year, around the same timeframe, she said she’d seen it standing at the edge of the forest before it ran back into the woods. \n    What bothered me so much about this event is that it happened in my neighborhood in broad daylight, and that I wasn’t the only person who’d seen it. This seems like the type of thing that would only happen at night in the middle of nowhere, when someone is already drowsy and their mind is playing tricks on them. But there it was for me in my front yard. If it was a hallucination you’d think I would’ve seen it again, or that I would’ve been stressed and tired beforehand, but I was fine and still haven’t seen anything as weird as that.\n     If my mom and I both saw this creature, maybe someone else has too. My next post is a drawing of what I saw that day.",

It feels like at least once a week things are disappearing right in front of my face out of literally no where and then reappearing in an obvious, prominent spot that it wasn't there when I was looking. Sometimes things will disappear for only a minute, whereas other times it may be until a few hours later. \n\nFor example, today while I was getting ready for work I was using my pot of eyebrow gel. It was right in front of me as I looked into the mirror to do my eyebrows. Literally in the middle of me doing them, I look down to put a little more product on my brush and it is gone! I searched the entire counter, the floor, and even the trash (my cats love to push things off the counter) and it was literally no where to be found. I gave up after a moment and went on with getting ready to leave work. Well as I get ready for bed tonight in my bathroom guess what reappeared!! And I don't mean in the floor kicked into a dark corner or under a wash cloth, I mean right dead center of the counter on the faucet.\n\nIs this something weird maybe?? Or am I literally just the most unobservant person in the world?",
