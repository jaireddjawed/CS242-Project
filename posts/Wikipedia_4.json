I'm curious if anyone here has any information on this topic or has any thoughts on it. \n\nFurthermore, I'm also wondering if we can see most Wikipedia articles being written by AI in the future. Do you believe that AI can dramatically increase the size of Wikipedia from only 6.6 million articles with an average article word count of only 650 today to a substantially higher number in the future ending the current stagnation of the size of Wikipedia we experience today? (If Wikipedia policies allow AI to write one article isn’t then possible for AI to write 10,000,000 articles)\n\nHow much larger do you believe AI can make Wikipedia grow compared to its current size? If Wikipedia was written by AI, how many articles do you think it would have, and what would the average length of these articles be?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts and opinions on this topic! If this question is in the wrong subreddit I apologize, and would like to be directed to a subreddit where it is appropriate to ask this question. I am finding it hard to find the answers on the internet and would like to know what the opinions of the members of the Wikipedia community regarding this topic are. Thank You",

Abstract noun coined from adjective morbid.\" The British lexicographer Susie Dent described \"having the morbs\" as \"to sit under a cloud of despondency\".[4]",
