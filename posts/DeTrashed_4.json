My first post here, but not our first detrash session (doggo and I) üòä\n\nQuick morning walk with my pup - on a mission to clean up a broken Jameson bottle I spotted on our walking path, when suddenly - our lucky day!! $100 bill!\n\nA few steps later, omg no way - two MORE bills!\n\n...\n\nLet me take a look at them closely.\n\nOh.\n\nDefinitely fake LOL\n\nWell, the high I got from finding \"the money\" didn't stop us from filling our bucket anyway!\n\nStill made me feel good about what we accomplished on our morning routine ‚ù§Ô∏è",
