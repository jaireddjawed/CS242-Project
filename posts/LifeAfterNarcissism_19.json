I am doing amazing and feel so insanely liberated and relieved a few months later. Everyday I feel stronger and happier, and now that I am actually alone (single, not alone obviously cause I've got my beautiful 1 year old son with me) I feel so much less lonely than I did during the entire relationship. \nBut I have already caught my ex telling my baby nasty things about me, telling him he feels sorry for him for having such an evil mother. Now I hope he is still too young to understand this right now, but there will come a day those words will definitely be heard and make an impact that I am not going to be so happy about. \nSo what can I do to protect my son from his father's manipulations? What can I teach him to make sure he stands strong and unmoved by all the word magic and how can I do that? \nHe is the absolute sunshine and the happiest most chilled baby you'll ever see. He is just always smiling and just so excited to meet people. I offer him structure and so much unconditional love and I hope that this will contribute to him growing up like a loving and caring boy/man who knows his worth and recognizes truth. What else can I do from now until he is grown enough to understand?",

        "text": "So I have 2 boys with my narc ex. We've been broken up for almost 2.5 years (yes, things got worse after we broke up) and he lost access to the kids almost a year ago. He's still suing me for custody and child support, but has not seen the kids since March 2017. Anyway, I can't imagine how long it's been since my kids have seen their paternal Gramma, who lives on the west coast and visits Ontario a few times a year. Nobody in my ex's family is \"allowed\" to communicate with me (as per my ex - I'm sure this is so he can maintain his narrative that I'm the crazy abusive one), but his mother started mailing letters to my kids with self-addressed stamped envelopes for replies. Okay, fine. But whenever I send her emails with photos of the kids' birthdays or Xmas or first day of school...she replies as if it were my kids writing her the email. She will not acknowledge me. My kids are 5 and 3 - they can't even read or write yet. One time, I wrote back saying, \"You know it's me who sends these emails and helps them mail drawings back to you, right?\" and she responded with, \"And I'm so glad that you do.\" Other than that, she has never acknowledged me or responded to me or asked me how I am doing or how the kids are doing -- nothing. Not since I hired a lawyer in September 2015 when her son was threatening me and scaring me and breaking into my house. We used to be close too! Before we broke up (*and before I hired a lawyer), she and I would talk on the phone for HOURS. Her ex-husband (my ex's dad) was also relentless and abusive and litigious - so she knows exactly what I am dealing with and going through. But she chooses to be \"loyal\" to her abusive son by treating me like a non-person. Is she planning on being my kids' penpal until...until what? Until they're older? I don't get it. If she wants a relationship with my kids, then it has to be enabled and facilitated through me unless a new parenting/access court order is created, which isn't likely any time soon.\n\nWhat do I do? Should I cut off her access? I really don't want my kids to have people in their lives who disrespect and disregard their mother. Or just don't care about their mother. When I was \"in\" with this family, there were NO BOUNDARIES at all and it was shocking to me. It was under the guise of their being such a \"close-knit\" family and I wouldn't understand because I'm not THAT close with my family. But now, that I'm \"out\"...they've completely cut me out like I no longer exist and my kids don't exist either! My ex- has 3 siblings who were all close to me and my kids while we were together. I don't hear from anybody at all, asking about them or wanting to see them. Just letters and emails from Grandma, completely disregarding me.\n\nAny advice? Do I put up with it so my kids have a connection to their dad's family? My family is very involved with me and us, so they already have a Gramma and Grampy close to them. Am I being petty?? It's hard to know how to establish healthy boundaries with people, having been through what I've been through with my ex and his family.",

        "text": "Growing up, my brother and I were raised solely by my dad as my mom has schizophrenia, and was unable to be a parent. To explain everything, some things I need to mention are sensitive and could cause discomfort. \n\nWhen I was eight, my father decided to adopt a new religion, and my husband says he chose this particular religion because it specifically gives him control. I was not allowed to cut my hair, date, text/call anyone male (unless they specifically asked him for permission and even then he would monitor my calls and make me sit in the room with him while on the phone so he could listen, or he would read my texts), or use tampons. I was not allowed to have sleepovers or go out with friends, until I had turned 18 and was getting ready to move out for college. \n\nThe summer before college, I wanted to find a job in the town I’d be moving to, about an hour away. My dad would not allow this, and told me, “Don’t worry about working, this is your last summer before you’re an adult, and I’ll help you pay for anything you need.” \n\nThe semester started, and my dad gave me $40 and changed the oil in my car. He refused to help me research loans, when he had been adamant that I go to college (I had never been keen on going until it was clear that he would think I was a failure if I didn’t.) I had had several dreams growing up, of being a writer (“anyone could write this, Chloe. You won’t make any money as a writer”)  or being a florist (“that’s just stupid”) and so I decided to become an English teacher. During that semester I called my dad and told him that I needed books and had just started working, two weeks after moving in, and he told me he couldn’t help me financially at all, after promising over and over that he would. \n\nThis seems inconsequential to me, but I’m stuck owing $15,000 for that semester, since I had no financial support. I dropped out of school, since I hadn’t been able to buy books and I had failed every class but the one I managed to get books for several weeks into the semester once I was paid. I had never wanted to be there in the first place, I only wanted to get away from him, and simultaneously have him not think I was a failure. \n\nI moved back home, and my dad constantly berated me for dropping out.  He immediately resumed controlling what I could do, and when. I had a boyfriend (he is my husband now) and I was only allowed to see him on certain days once my dad began a home fellowship, and he wanted to save face and not look like he had a “blatantly rebellious” daughter. \n\nSome time later I am working full time hours for part time pay, and I had an emergency come up where I needed to borrow $500 from my dad. He agreed, paid for the emergency on his credit card, and then said I would have to pay it back plus interest, which seemed fair and I had no choice but to agree. But a few weeks later my car insurance was due, and I was short $70, but I would have had it before the insurance lapsed. Dad would not wait to pay, and instead of just paying the extra $70 which I would have had within days, he paid for 6 months of insurance on his credit card and told me I had to pay for that plus interest as well, while telling me “I really saved you money, Chloe.” \n\nHe forced me to change jobs, he almost ruined my relationship several times, and any time I did something he disliked he would revert to saying I was selfish, manipulative, and deceitful. He constantly would tell me I wasn’t as smart as he is and that I can’t make good decisions. And he would yell, sometimes for hours, until I would cry and then he would yell even more and say he refused to be manipulated. \n\nLast May, I became engaged. My dad took monumental offense at not being asked to be the minister, telling me that I knew Christianity was a lie and Judaism is the truth and that my marriage would fail if I was married by a Christian minister. He repeatedly tried to take over my wedding, and if I said no to him, he would resume belittling me (selfish, manipulative, etc.) He would tell me that he prayed about me and God revealed to him all the ways I was deceitful (refused to give any details of what was revealed to him). This continued for the three months I was engaged. He didn’t pay for anything, but would tell people he offered to pay for whatever I needed for the wedding (he didn’t) and then promised to reimburse me for what I paid (he didn’t.) \n\nHe still tries to take control of things, most recently my husband’s and my taxes. He frequently jabs at me for not being pregnant (I haven’t been married even six months) and will make me feel guilty for not visiting/calling weekly (but he will call before it’s been a week since the last time we spoke.) \n\nI have anxiety, especially about contacting my dad, and he always tells me that is because I am disobedient to him and God. I do not know how I was disobedient, since I always did what he asked and he demanded I follow his religion. Any medical ailment I have he says the same. \n\nMy husband believes he is a narcissist, and I relate to much of what I read about children of narcissistic parents, but I feel as though I am an unreliable resource and I can’t trust my own intuition where this is concerned. I’d like some insight. ",

        "text": "This is the first time I've tried sharing what I've been through the last two years with others who also have experienced  a relationship with a narcissist. \n\nI've spent thousands of dollars on this person. I realize I'm to blame for giving it to him but I always thought I was helping him (and I was in love and later I think just under his influence).  Of course when I mentioned it the last time we were together I was told that he didn't put a gun to my head for the money and he owed me nothing. Sooo...\n\nThere are so many things that's happened similar to other things I've read on this forum. The big ones were when he told me cheated bc we were broke up. When in fact we had a small argument and were not broke up. But somehow I convinced myself to believe him and stay another year. The other was when he would lie and tell me he was at work when he wasn't. I'm not even sure why someone would like me about that but i guess thats part of the N world.\n\nSo I'm attempting NC for the fourth, fifth or tenth time now, I'm not sure I've lost track. But it's 16 days today and that's a new record so I'm hopeful. He is blocked on all platforms and has now resorted to calling from other numbers, that I immediately block. I also had my voice mail turned off because hearing the sadness  in his voice (yeah I know it's fake now but still) could put me in a weak place where I might cave and make contact.\n\nHe also showed up at my house recently. I'm assuming he is getting desperate because he is losing control and his financial support (I mean, it's almost rent time). \n\nLike others I'm having difficulty getting him out of my head and not second guessing my decision to go NC and get away. I also find myself fixated on getting confirmation of my suspicions even though I know in my gut that I'm right to suspect. \n\nNot sure of next steps. It's painful and hard and I not sure others who haven't gone through it truly understand how different it is from a regular breakup.  \n\nSo just taking it day by day (sometimes minute by minute though). \n",

We work in different departments but it's just us two at night time, with customer flow and lots of things to do. \n\nI talk *about* my boyfriend all the time. I talk to him on my headset often too. But this guy. Always has to hug me hello or goodbye. Texts me randomly and not very much but more than what is appropriate, imo. Will say very subtle things that hint interest. Has straight up told me he liked me \"until\" he found out I had a boyfriend. \n\nIdk what to do. I'm sitting in the backroom here now. He was like, \"let me know before you leave\" which usually means he wants to chat for awhile or hug me goodbye or somethinggggggg. I wanna just sneak out and go home. But then that would be awkward for next week.\n\nI don't even know *WHY* I gave him my number. I feel like I'm pressured into this shit all the time. And I can't talk to anyone about it because I should be able to establish boundaries (or rather I'm expected to).\n\nWhy can't people leave me alone? I'm really not trying to be sexist but it's ALWAYS men making me feel uncomfortable and gross like this. I just want to be able to say no.\n\n\n**edit::::::::::** I love this subreddit. You guys are great &amp; thank you tons. Having an ndad made it hard to develop a proper relationship with men. I'm also still struggling from lack of self-worth, and so it's easy to blame myself and make excuses for not establishing boundaries. It's something I'm working on. There are other things I haven't mentioned that this person has done that, now, I see as wholly inappropriate and I will do my best to confront the situation. \n\n**another tidbit of info to add more context to the situation, if you are interested::::::::::::** It does go a little deeper. I have a great male co-worker at the same location (he's the shift before mine so we overlap for an hour or two) and we shit talk and make jokes to each other. Recently the guy I'm having an issue with (i will just call him M) has taking a liking to speaking badly of my friend when he can. Last week M took the night off and got some coverage for his shift, but he stayed around for a bit as he usually does. I was taking a short break with my friend and M looks sour and just leaves because my friend is \"killing his brain cells\". I don't really care. But he texts me right after saying he didn't care for my friend and how he was a little jaded because he \"wanted me to himself ;P\". I did NOT even reply to that. And trust me, I have those messages saved.",

It kind of has to do with that though.\n\n\nI've gone NC in the last few months and had been preparing for about half a year before that. I've noticed that when I am upset, or something upsetting happens, I pull away. I won't let myself be comforted and don't let any feelings in whatsoever. I do want to be comforted but it makes me really uneasy and usually only makes me feel worse. My SO for instance is a great person who has never been anything but fully supportive, but I can tell that I pull away from him too. Not like I don't spend time with him, or that I am unkind, but I don't allow myself to feel anything. I know I love him and I can list all the reasons why, even in bad times. But I just can't acces my feelings. It feels like I am empty on the inside, and it makes me feel terrible. \n\n\nI found out that my Nparents have created a debt in my name yesterday and even though I was angry at first, I didn't really feel hurt or disappointed. I just really wanted to use the money for something else (my wedding) but fine. It's just money, I'll just pay. I went through today feeling pretty numb about it, and about anything else. When I noticed this, I felt like there must be something wrong with me. How can I not be upset about this, and how can I not acces any other feelings like I should?\n\n\nPart of me feels like it must be a mechanism I've adopted to deal with overly-emotional stuff but it's really starting to get in the way. I can't tell people I love them, I don't feel happy about joyous things or things I've really wanted. I tend to just not feel much at all, and later on feel like I really should have. I look back and realise I've always done this. But now I've got good people around me and I want to be able to let them in, and feel things. \nI'm worried that I'll ruin the great things I do have by not feeling anything, and eventually pushing people away. My wedding is coming up, and I feel horrible at the idea that I'll say \"I do\" and not feel all the love and gratitude I want to feel. \n\n\nHas anyone felt this way too, and how to you deal with it?",

It's the same thoughts over and over, but I'm at a loss for how to get closure. I can't contact him because of the abuse in our relationship. It's not like I can get things off my chest by communicating with him. I've tried writing down all my feelings into an email-I-don't-send to him but it doesn't help.

        "text": "I hope this will work now. I'm still getting used to how RedIt works. But anyway, this is my story, and it's long:\n\nI lost contact with my father in 2012. It's the last time I recall sending him a nasty text message. I said some horrible words. We have never spoken to each other ever since. He was a horrible man, but he blatantly denies his behaviour. He has always said that he was only disciplining me and my two brothers. Yeah sure! He has always denied doing anything wrong. He fought with my mother a lot, mistreated her thing. He mistreated us kids too. i've had a lot of arguments with him but he just indirectly accused me of making things up by stating that he can't remember doing what I claimed he did. But when I was a child he would beat me up, then say sorry, but the next day he'd do it again. He'd also lecture us a lot too, along with my mother. I was lectured a lot more about my behaeaviour, how to act at school and in public, etc, because I was born blind. So even though my mother and father did what they thought was helpful at the time, their attitudes behind their actions was horrible. And they weren't consistently nice.\n\nMy Dad was more physically abusive than my mother although she got more physically abusive to us as we got older. My nparents argued a lot about how to discipline us, but at the end of the day they were both physically abusive. They were also mentally and emotionally abusive. Yet they expected us to behave like good children! NMUM and NDAD didn't set good examples of good behaviour all the time. So due to the fact that I didn't have a good relationship with my father, I estranged myself from him.\n\nI am now completely estranged from my mother as well. A few weeks ago I sent her a very strong text message saying that I never want to speak to her again or go near her. I simply unblocked her number, sent the message, and blocked her again. I used to argue with her a lot, all the time basically. The last straw for me was when we that nto a bight back in 2012 and so I left her place and moeaved away. The last time she saw me was in 2014 and I had a massive argument with her and sent her away. She had control of my finances and used my e-mail provider to create e-mail accounts for her own personal use. She wouldn't let me spend money unless it suited her (this had gone on for years and I always thought that she was just helping me with my financial situation), but I found out otherwise. I had to clear my name with this provider so I could cancel from them on  ms. I also changed my banking details.\n\nMy mother's emotional abuse was absolutely horrendous. She did everything in her power to set up situations and pin the blame on me, all so she could claim me as mentally ill so she could get attention and have full control over me. I wasn't having it so I kept telling her to quit the crap. She always labelled any reactions as some dramatic like health thing, expected me to listen to her advice, and tried to make it look like she was just trying to help me and that I had a lot of problems to fix. She didn't like that I told her to let me fix my life and she can fix her own life. NMUM especially haeated it when I ld her to look at her own problems before trying to fix mine. I'd tell her that she much have a problem if she had to yell at me to put her point across. she really couldn't handle that. ih no contact with have whatsoever now. She very hurtful person and even a letter wouldn't make her see reason. She could never be wrong and I had to always be wrong. What a malicious manipulator! I'm in a better not now. I don't like my neighbours but at least I have some good friends and can keep away from the neighbours. I hope I never see my nparents again.",

Being around her judging my every word and move, and her passive aggressive backhanded comments led me to feel that anxiety I haven't felt in months. I am still not fully healed and I don't know how to fix it. Growing up I had eating disorders because of a mixture of thinking I wasn't good enough, and finding some sense of control in my out of control household. My nmom also suffered from eating disorders as well, and to this day she downplays how unhealthy it is. To her, it is normal to be overly obsessive with your appearance, and anyone who isn't is considered disgusting. Even though I no longer do things like starve myself, make myself sick after eating, or compulsively take exlax (gross and embarrassing to admit) I still DESPISE my body. Its hard for me to go shopping for clothes, look at myself in the mirror, or see pictures of myself because it leads to the same old overwhelming anxiety. Its like I instantly revert back to that abused little girl again. It hits me so so hard, and I could honestly cry in the moment. How do I overcome this? It is crazy to me that I can articulate exactly why I have come to feel this way, and I completely understand that my brain is warped. My biggest wish in life is to be comfortable in my own skin, and I am afraid I never will because of my past. Any advice on how to finally overcome my warped mentality? ",

        "text": "My ex texted my daughter to have me drop her off at a grocery store parking lot this afternoon, not too far from my house. She is responsible for pickup at my residence per our court agreement. Says so, black and white. I was home at the appropriate time, so I told her she can come to the house to pick up, like every week during exchange. She called the cops, telling them I refused the custody exchange. I spoke with the cop at length, read her the text message word for word from my daughters phone, also read them the custody agreement word for word where it says that the receiving parent is responsible for pickup at my residence. I was threatened with a misdemeanor by the cops. They backed down after I read them the custody agreement, and told me I am doing nothing wrong, and that the law is on my side. \n\nThe officer I spoke with told me to call her back, and offer to meet up at a common place. I told the officer I was concerned that she was drinking, and that she gets this way when she gets drunk. The officer stated she was in the area. I asked the officer to meet up at the mutual place, and that I wanted a sobriety test done. Officer said she couldn't wait around for an hour for her to show up. But that if during the exchange I smelled alcohol on her breath, I could call her back. So the officer called my ex and explained to her that if I suspected that she had been drinking, then I would be calling her immediately, and that she (the officer) would already be in the parking lot. \n\nSo I called to arrange a pickup at the grocery store parking lot. She said she was on the phone with child services, and that the police would be coming to get my daughter tonight. Said she couldn't come get my daughter because she has to be at home because the foster kids will be returning. She has taken in 2 foster kids by the way. So earlier this evening when she wanted me to meet her at the grocery store, she was there to send the foster kids away to visit with her older daughter. Soooo she couldn't come get them then for some reason. And now, she can't come get them because she has the foster kids. \n\nAnyway, a few hundred text messages later about my dump of a house, me going to jail, me being the bad guy, me refusing to allow her to take our daughter, text messages to our daughter about me going to jail, me going to jail tomorrow if I don't bring my daughter over to her house BECAUSE she cannot come over because she has the foster kids at her house.....\n\nDid I say it was nearing a full moon, a blueblood full moon? Holy smokes! My daughter is here with me, wondering, feeling bothered by her mother's mania. I explain everything to my daughter, including the narcissistic behavior, the contrasting stories her mother has spoken about today. We sit here tonight wondering what the hell happened to her mother's mind. \n\nI'm not afraid of the process. I'm no longer afraid of her. I take notes, good notes to present to the judge, to the cops, to whoever will listen. \nI urge each and everyone of you who survived a narcissistic relationship, whether it is family or an ex-spouse, to take a stand for your own well being, for your own rights, for your own right to live the life you deserve. Don't back down, don't be afraid of them. They may shout and fear monger, but do not be afraid. Stand your ground! I hope for all of you, the best outcomes.",

        "text": "Hi.\n\nI had to leave the last job I had because of a narc messing about with me, all the usual narc like manipulations and eventually accusing me of being crazy. It was a rollercoaster few months.\n\nThey told management I wasnt doing my job so I had to leave a job I liked, although it was only contract I still had to leave and in my bosses eyes didn't do my job well. I feel like I left the boss down because I was quite eager to fit in and do well for the company.\n\nThey were a nasty piece of work and confronted me alone to tell me they would destroy me, all very pantomine villainy. \n\nYet everyone else seems to fall for their sweetness and smiles charm game. It bothers me they got away with what they did and no one knows their true nature.\n\nPeople at my new job ask why I left the last place and what was it like there, and while I know what happens in vegas stays in vegas, and I dont like to gossip or talk trash about people, not talking about what happened feels like Im covering up for the narc and that's what they want. I think it should be exposed.\n\nYet If I tell people I dealt with a toxic nasty person who made me leave, it probably makes me look like Im being petty, like I like to talk about people behind their back . \n\nYou can never tell someone everything,about the mind games, the smirks, gaslighting, I dont think they would understand unless they had dealing with a narc and seen what they are like. \n\nThey would just assume I didnt get on with the person, maybe I had an attitude? or maybe at best I was bullied a little because Im too meek. \n\nSo Im torn between not saying anything about what happened or telling people someone pushed to get me fired. It still bothers me I didnt actually tell the boss about the threats that were made to me, but even if I did would I be just a sheep warning one wolf about another wolf? \n\nIt's all very frustrating. I just had to deal with a coworker, I feel for anyone who was in a relationship or have family like this.",

        "text": "I was originally going to post this on /r/raisedbynarcissists, but this sub felt a lot more fitting. Also, this post is gonna be a long one, so bear with me if you want to read it (There's a TL/DR at the bottom).\n\nIf someone told me over a decade ago that I'd be in this sort of situation regarding my family (especially my mother), I probably wouldn't have believed them. However, I can probably say with confidence that I saw the clouds of the storm looming in around the time I was 17 ten years ago.\n\nYou see, my NMom used to be a legitimately decent person. She was caring and dedicated towards me, and I naively trusted her as being a competent parent. However, after she married an ex-con turned Born-Again Christian to be my second NStepDad (first one was utter scum and currently rotting in the ground from a stroke), she completely changed from the parent I used to know. Instead of being the free-spirit Liberal I remembered her to be  as a kid, she became a right-wing, staunch Conservative nutjob by the time I was in high school. And unfortunately, that was around the time I realized I was gay.\n\nI'll skip most of the drama that ensued with me coming out, since it really wasn't that big of a deal and NOT the reason I went Hard NC with her. Instead of her or my NStepDad giving me crap about my orientation, they basically just ignored it and lived in utter denial. When I came out to my NMom at 17, her response was \"I really don't believe you,\" as well as a 45 minute long argument about how I had Aspergers (not true), and that I was using the idea of being gay as an excuse to not be social. And after that, she and NStepDad spent well over 9 years never bringing it up or acknowledging anything in my personal life.\n\nNo, the reason things *really* went to crap was just about 3 and a half years ago, long after I moved out of their home and got myself my own apartment. Unfortunately, mail addressed for me still kept going to their place. Mostly junk-mail, but sometimes a credit card offer would slip in.\n\nWell, back in the summer of 2014, my NMom decided to go behind my back and make a credit card in my name. I never checked my credit score, so I had no idea. It wasn't until **over a year later** that I discovered the truth, when I was house-sitting at their place while they went to vacation with my younger siblings. A package came to the door addressed to me, and I called her asking about it.\n\nShe immediately started apologizing like crazy, and said she originally did it so she could be able to rent a car and visit my sister a few states over when she was having her third baby (which was true). And since I was an idiot, all I did was make her promise to pay off the card. And since she technically *was* (she paid near the bare minimum, but enough to keep my credit score passable) I should've seen all the red-flags, or realize she was using the card more than she was letting on; especially since the package that came in was a huge ProActive cream set (for a woman who was 44 at the time). Unfortunately, I eventually let that moment pass, and didn't pursue anything for a while after.\n\nThat was until a couple years ago when an envelope came to my apartment, including a credit card that I never made. I instantly called the credit card company, and verified that I didn't make it before getting it cancelled. I also discovered who did it, since NMom was stupid enough to use her home number for the contact info. Needless to say, I was absolutely livid.\n\nI called her as soon as the card was cancelled, and chewed her ear out for making ANOTHER credit card. She started giving me crocodile tears, and swore it was an accident. By then I knew it as crap, and threatened her over email to tell me everything she did in my name or else I called the cops.\n\nTHAT was when I learned it wasn't just those two credit cards. She actually made TWO credit cards back in 2014, and never mentioned the second one when I first found out. Unfortunately, that was all the useful information I could get out of her, since she kept claiming she didn't know how to check the cards or know how much she put on them.\n\nFor months, I completely ghosted her and struggled to know what to do. I wanted to call the police, but I didn't want to hurt my siblings. However, she knew that fact just as well as I did, and kept trying to guilt-trip me into talking to her again. She tried to get other family members to talk to me, which I refused since I wanted her to know how much she hurt me. After months of limited contact, I was finally able to figure out from a family friend how to check my credit score myself, and see what credit cards were in my name.\n\nThe debt she made was over **seven thousand dollars.**\n\nAnd I learned that on Christmas Morning while at my Dad's.\n\nI instantly called up both credit card companies, and told them everything I knew. After all the time she spent not giving me any answers, I completely lost any respect or love I had for that woman. I also put forth the effort to get her name off all my personal info while the fraud claims were being processed (car title, insurance, bank statements, etc.), only contacting NMom to get her to sign the necessary paperwork. During that time, she \"accidentally\" deposited a paycheck from her work into my bank account, only to take it out the next day; since her name was still connected to my account at the time (I originally made it when I was a teenager), I could only assume she was planning to empty my account if I didn't contact her soon, which would've been *technically* legal since she made a deposit soon beforehand. Fortunately, I made a new bank account before she could do anything.\n\nAnd on this day one year ago, I got my car insurance transferred to my own name alone, completely cutting any ties with NMom. And as soon as I got home, I pulled out the long-crafted, venom-seething goodbye email I wrote and proofread for months on end. I pointed out every instance of betrayal and pain I experienced from her over the 9 years she spent ignoring me, explained just how much her actions impacted me negatively, and made it clear I knew how little she really loved me.\n\nThat email had enough toxicity to take down a rhino, but I felt nothing but elation when I pressed send, completely cutting her off and disowning her from my life. I also blocked her number and NStepDad's number from my phone.\n\nShe only sent two things through the mail after that email was sent. The first was an \"apology letter,\" which literally took up half a sheet of paper; within it was an overabundance of guilt-tripping (claiming how I didn't care about my siblings for leaving them, pointing out how she originally bought my car, etc.), lying with the claim that she was only trying to help my credit score (she didn't), and literally ending the letter with a King of the Hill reference. I wish I was kidding.\n\nThe second thing she sent was a manila envelope filled with junk mail I received at her house, a form from the post-office to transfer any future mail to my place, and an invitation to my little brother's birthday party. I declined.\n\nEver since then though, she has luckily avoided contacting me in any way. No emails. No calls. No letters. And best of all, I'm moving to a new apartment on Wednesday with my boyfriend, so she won't know my new address as well.\n\nI know that this is a huge post to make, but this is the first time I'm able to *really* get everything out in words to share with others. And since I'm really wanting to make 2018 a better year for myself and my partner, I figured it'd be good to make a note on this day as something to look back to. \n\n**\nTL/DR:** Nmom cared more about my social security number than my BF's name, and racked up over $7K in credit card fraud with THREE cards behind my back. I got them all reported, and today marks the one year anniversary I cut her out of my life like the tumor she was.",

        "text": "A few quick things, in bullet form:\n\n- Younger brother, I haven't said a word to since a month before the wedding when he decided to willingly not attend for a BS reason, messages me.  He starts asking me questions about stuff I left at N/Edad's house that I already gave instructions to throw away.  Just like my N/Edad, brother seems to think I'll just forget his actions.   No chance of that.  I gave a total of two words in response over 3 days, and shut that line right back down again.\n\n- Speaking of N/Edad, he STILL hasn't acknowledged or congratulated me on the wedding.  He did however speak up when he wanted sympathy because his shitty life choices are sent him back to the hospital for a heart operation.  DW wants to have lunch with him by herself, which I'm fine with.  I'm not worried about her spine, as she plans to lay out to him exactly when I'm so mad and avoiding contact.  At the same time, she wants to try to have a FIL/DIL connection with him.  It's her choice on wanting to try, but at the same time she knows my feelings on it all.\n\n- Two ex-bridesmaids that got kicked out of the wedding party decided to pop their heads up, likely after realizing they've alienated almost everyone else.\n\n- EX BM #1 did everything from cry about the dress price (Less than $120) to the bachelorette party plans.  She insisted they do the whole penis-barcrawl-male stripper drunken debauchery routine, which is the 100% opposite DW wanted.  We suspect she wanted to do all this because she missed out when she herself got married years ago.\n\nEX BM #1 pulled EX BM #2 into her games, going so far as try going behind DW's back... through me.  #2 started texting me one evening, insistent that I keep the conversation a secret, and started grilling me about how they want to throw this massive penis-barcrawl-etc surprise bachelorette party for DW.\n\nOf course, the first thing I did was sit DW down next to me so she could watch the entire conversation unfold.\n\nThey could not wrap it around their heads that DW wanted a quiet picnic afternoon at a winery, not a drunken party.  Almost immediately after my \"secret\" conversation with her, and filling DW's sister (who was MOH) in on it all, the two got booted from the wedding party.\n\nNeedless to say, they didn't take it well.  They tried stirring up shit everywhere with anyone that knew us, be it in person or on FB.  We're talking full junior high school-level cattiness and immaturity.\n\nAt one point, I went so far as to go into their little conversation group and laid out to EVERYONE exactly what transpired, and did so it a calm, almost deadpan fashion.\n\nOf course, after an hour of whining from them, I was booted and blocked.  No skin off my tits.  DW and I both agreed that anyone who, knowing us, still believed them wasn't much of a friend to us to begin with and weren't worth worrying over.\n\nSo this past Saturday we go out dancing for the first time since November.  Who is there but EX BM #1, and she keeps trying to be all friendly and talkative with DW... who was having none of it.  She made a point of brushing her off at every turn.  #1 would even try interjecting herself into conversations between DW and other people, which would only serve to make DW turn away.\n\nLast night, #2 texts DW out of the blue, sending congratulations on the wedding and wanting to put all the issues behind them.  She gave a full non-apology apology, blaming everyone but herself (work stress, life stress, blahblahblah you know the spiel).  Both of us immediately recognized it as such.  She didn't say one word in actual remorse or self-responsibility for her actions.\n\nDW had a minimal conversation with her, but made it clear all was NOT ok, and that they likely could never be friends again.\n\nNo matter how hard they try, we're not going to let any of them pull us back into their circle of shittiness.  We have enough of our own crap to deal with.",

        "text": "Hi everybody,\n\nI broke up with my n-ex a couple of weeks ago and maintained as low contact as possible. No-contact is not possible since she is part of an organization I volunteer at and which is really important to me. I block direct contact everywhere though, its just that I see occasional posts or comments of her in social media groups of said organization. And I might see her at meetings of the organization. \n\nWhen we came together she was alone in the city we met, she only had one or two friends. I therefore introduced and integrated her to my social circle and friends which are mostly part of the organization as well. Even during our relationship she used those friends against me by saying that \"even they are more capable of loving her than me\". At that time, she also told me that she is in contact with my friends and they are aware of \"how I mistreat her\". This gave me major feelings of distrust I tried to put aside since I couldn't cope with it at that time. \n\nAfter the break-up I immediately got in contact with my most trusted friend in that group in order to tell him I broke up and that I am really afraid that my n-ex will manipulate them in order to make me the monster. He told me about a situation where she told him something bad about me while we were still together, which made me even more afraid. What else did she tell people while we were still together? But the general context he tried to put the situation in was that it is normal that ex-partner always talk bad about each other (!) after a break up and that I shouldn't be afraid. \n\nOf course I am aware that this is not a normal break up and that my n-ex is not normal in her behaviour. Since the break up I have the feeling that contact with my friends declined and they become more silent when they text with me. Another friend she visited already told me that she was talking bad about me, but this time he did not really trust her and told me.\n\nMy big fear right now is that I am about to loose my whole social circle in the city I live in and that my volunteering work I invested my whole time and effort in will be in danger because of that. Am I just escalating my thoughts? Is this threat real? How should I behave?\n\nI try to not talk about my n-ex at all anymore and will not show my fear in order to not be perceived as a paranoid person that has something to hide. But maybe that's wrong? Any thoughts of you would help me!\n\nOver the last weeks she suddenly became way more active in the organization, which I perceive as her trying to make me realize that I am about to loose control and she is in charge now. I have the feeling she is ready to use every mean possible in order to punish me for blocking and breaking up with her.",

With the full knowledge that this was a manipulation he was pulling, I chose to be honest because that is who I am.\n\n“I would really appreciate it if we could do this particular exchange in person. That ***** means way too much to me to just have it dropped off at my door like it means nothing.” He said he could but that he wasn’t ready to see me yet. \n\nLater that day he got pissy about something else and told me, “Forget this, I’ll leave it in my mailbox. You can come and get it.” I should have been crushed but I was just SO happy to get it back that I sincerely didn’t care. Plus the thing he was pissy about was ridiculous and hypocritical and thankfully I was already at the point of seeing it as such.\n\nIt occurred to me the other day that I had manipulated him into thinking that it would hurt me more to pick up this item from a cold and impersonal mailbox vs. waiting for him to glory me with his presence.\n\nI won :)\n",

        "text": "I spent 12 years married to a narcissistic woman.  I won't go into details as we all have been there. But I will say that this woman is masterful in her manipulation, gas lighting, blaming, and shaming.\n\nIt's been 4 years since I was discarded now.  While I now readily admit and recognize my old codependent ways that got me into that mess in the first place, I was a lot more independent going into that relationship and valued my space and alone time which I faught endlessly to defend during my marriage.  It was the one area that she struggled to invade though the onslaught against it was feirce and constant.\n\nMy first post abuse relationship was a nightmare.  I felt needy and clingy like never before.  I was constantly reading between the lines, worrying that she was upset with me, was going to dump me, etc.  I was a complete mess.  After that ended I decided to take a full year to dig into my issues and worked tirelessly to heal and learn from my past.  I reached a point where I felt on top of things like never before.  I had found happiness from within and after a few dates along the way where I actually chose not to pursue them, I decided that I was happy to be single for once and relished it.  My new business that me narc ex wife wouldn't allow me to do was doing great, I had all kinds of great new friends and reconnected with old friends as well, life was amazing!  \n\nI eventually met a beautiful woman who I have now been with for a year and things are great.  I finally feel like I'm with the kind of person that I deserve and I am madly in love.  I came into this relationship from a happy and independent place, and as the relationship goes on, I am beginning to feel needy again and I can't seem to shake it.  It's crazy because in my marriage I was cool and collected, even though I was being fooled all along.  I always felt secure and was the one who always pushed for more space.  But after I was discarded, I just find myself anxious in my relationships like never before.  I feel like something on me is broken and I can't figure it out.  This seems to be the last piece of the puzzle. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this?\n\nEdit: spelling",

She was diagnosed with bipolar syndrome (10 years ago, by two physicians, but left her meds after 2 weeks) and im pretty pretty sure she is a narcissist. Im not going to talk about all my history of abuse, but it includes beats and alcoholism. \n\nI will start when i went back to my home town this new year, we (husband, mother in law and me) went to her home town for first time in two years after i moved out 2 years ago. All the time she was a control freak, didnt even talked to my husband - who she didnt knew because she skip my wedding (neither did she knew my MIL until that moment)-, but talked all the time with my mother in law, and i mean SHE talked to her ALL THE TIME without stopping, like a crazy person. It was really weird, she told my MIL every kind of things, even about her bowel movements, even about her genetics and family cancer, all this without anyone asking anything, without even being a theme on the table. And the cherry on the top, secretly, as she asked my enabler dad to leave the room when husband and i went to the beach, on the last day we were on that city, told my MIL really mean things about me. MIL doesnt want to tell anyone exactly what she said but told my husband that she had to defend me several times. \nAfter we return and i learned about this, i politely, but crying, called her out on this and she told me with insults that our relationship was over, that we were going no contact because how dare me and who do i think i am.  \n\nBefore this it seemed imposible to me to have no contact with her, i would not know how to start that conversation. But with this i realized that she is toxic and i don’t want to be in a toxic environment any more, this is my life and im an adult, i get to decide. Don’t want anyone to insult me any more. Don’t want to see my father insulted in my face one more day. Its toxicity or healthiness, and i choose the latter.  \n\nIm going no contact with my Nmother but asking her to take therapy if she wants to reestablish the relationship with me, 8 months (maybe,12?, any advised is welcomed) of therapy and then we can talk again if she continues her treatment. But im worried that maybe she will not have the time or money to make this, mi Edad and she are not poor, but she is in a college master right now and money is tight for them. Im still worried about hurting her feelings, about asking her for something that she cannot do. Im stupidly thinking this might be impossible for her. But in the other hand i don’t want her near me being as she is now, and that is definitive. \n\nBy the way, does narcissists really get better with therapy? Had any of you have a positive experience with this. ",

The last time we were in court, the judge was just as much of a narc as my ex-wife. I got my butt handed to me repeatedly because of it, until the day came when she got a DUI during the course of our divorce. It was an interesting interaction because he sided with her up to this point during the divorce proceedings. He asked her for details about her DUI, because I had complained about her driving our daughter around drunk. She was busted alone, without our daughter. In her narcissism, to hide the truth she pleaded the 5th. Down came the judges fist onto his stand with a loud boom, him pointing his finger and shaking his hand at her, telling her that she had better not come into his courtroom and plead the fifth about her drinking and driving when I was requesting full custody. I've never seen anyone cower so low that day in front of a judge. But it wasn't enough. And she continues to behave in narcissistic ways. Stuff still all my fault, blah blah blah. I used to be scared to go to court when dealing with her. But today I met with a lawyer, and everything seemed okay as we planned out our actions. \n\nHow about anyone else out there? Any crazy court stories with narcissists? I just realized something... there probably wouldn't be courts if it were not for narcissists. Any truth you think?",

        "text": "Hey. Thanks for your time. \n\nI moved away from nmom and in with my kickass supportive dad half a year ago. Best decision ever. I stayed quiet about my situation with nmom, didn't really want to annoy people and I didn't want to cause any more ruckus than there already was. \n\nI have a friend who lives with her nmom and doesn't have anywhere to escape. I feel for her deeply, and I hope that she can get out. Today is her 18th birthday (mine is soon!) and a robotics mentor of ours has offered his home until she goes to college, which is very kind. \n\nI'm uncomfortable about today, though. For the years we've known each other, while I've stayed quiet about my situation, my friend has talked on and on about her mother and how horrible her situation is. Again, I feel for her. It's terrible what's happening. But whenever I say any tiny thing about my life (eg \"My mom won't let me go on that field trip\" or \"Sorry I didn't get work done, my mom got sick so I was helping her all night\"), she explicitly invalidates me (eg \"At least you don't live with my mom\" or \"Well last week I didn't put a dish away so now I don't have a phone anymore\"). She talks on and on about her life and gets all sorts of pity presents from people, from food, to internships, to money... Talking about my situation makes me uncomfortable, but meanwhile, my dad and I can't afford to eat, much less send me to college or get me opportunities. \n\nWhen I talk to adults or people who know my friend about  my household stuff, they compare me to her and tell me to be grateful and that I don't deserve any help since I moved out. Hello? Nmom still lives within walking distance, and I almost died in the process of living with her. Once I had the courage to be brutally honest about my mom, and I was told to deal with it and that the authorities were reserved for people like my friend. \n\nI just don't know what to do. To even think about talking about my issues makes me feel hopelessly invalid, like I'm just being a wuss and don't deserve to feel the way I do. I saved myself. I'm supposed to be okay now. I should be helping my friend, I should be helping her celebrate her birthday, her freedom day that so many of our mutual friends have kept timers down to. \n\nMy nmom always said that on my 18th birthday she'd kill herself. The only person with a timer is me.  ",

My N(?)Mom wouldn't let me buy sports bras, when I was young, and just starting to wear bras. \n\nI had to wear an underwire bra. The other girls in school would make fun of me when they saw my bra strap. It was humiliating. \n\nI suspect it was because my Mother found that bras like that (crop tops, sports bras, were too \"masculine\"). I wasn't allowed to play sports either, perhaps partly for this reason. \n\nIt was very liberating, and better on my back, to wear something that doesn't have to be fitted, expensive, and that I don't have to think as much about, or at least don't have as much shame over. \n\nI wish I'd done this sooner, because then I'd be able to run. I could never run because of my big boobs (relative to my frame). Also, back problems were bad, because I'm a large cup size (on a small frame, again.) \n\nI suddenly understood why women could run and do things. I wish I'd done this sooner, and am confused why my Mother was so against it. Bra wearing contained a huge amount of shame, and now, I'm afraid to let people see my bra (even now, at 28 years old). \n\nPart of the reason maybe is because my Mother was ashamed of her small chest. I was larger, so maybe she couldn't deal with it? I remember wearing two bras, just for support, because she either couldn't accept I was a larger cup size, or I was afraid to ask about it. Being female contains a huge amount of shame because of this...\n\nI've been wearing crop tops for two years, and started to get into wearing bras again, but I don't want to...I bought a bralet the other day which seemed to be a compromise, but growing up basically I wasn't allowed to wear anything other than an underwire, which is strange. \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening to my \"bra\" story, and I'm glad RBN?LAN exists, because Narcissists are weird :|",

I know I know, that’s a long time for a good news to happen, but if you been in my position where your mother used you for her own emotional needs, you will also want to jump up and down in joy. \n\nI have been learning about “emotional enmeshment” for the past 2-3 days and it has set me free from my wretched dirty rat infested mental prison. I call it a virtual prison, but it is in fact a real prison. Especially when this mental prison was the same exact reason why most of my relationships failed and I was in depression most of my life, got addicted to porn, started smoking cigarettes and using drugs .\n\nI am just glad I am alive. Thank you Lord for setting me free from her jail.\n\np.s: Thanks to you lovely people for giving me true guidance even when I was adamant in not receiving them. You don't know how much you mean to me. A million Thank yous! ",

        "text": "I had narcissistic parents who also sexually abused me. I have no contact now. I have done a lot of therapy about sexual abuse and drug/ alcohol addiction. I didn't really work on their narcissistic behaviours at the time because I was focussed on getting over the abuse. I did get over it and I no longer find it intruding into my thoughts more than the average survivor, that is sometimes a lot, sometimes not much but no matter what- I now take care of myself and support myself emotionally. I don't have a romantic partner. I don't have any friends because I have had a bit of bad luck where I will meet someone and they seem so cool, then they tell me how awful all their other friends are and eventually I am the awful one and I am \"out of their lives forever\".\n\nI think it is healthy to not have those friends in my life anymore. I started to have enough well days that I could consider getting a part time job. My boss regularly yells at me and other employees. It seems like the only way not to get yelled at is to pretend to hate whoever she is angry at and talk shit and criticise them. It is my turn this week.\n\nI know I should quit this job for my mental health but I'm scared to say anything. I can't believe I allowed another narcissist into my life. I understand that I might attract them because a lot of people know my history, but I thought I was being so careful. I don't know what to do. Is it like ripping off a bandaid and the separation only hurts momentarily? The boss is in my social circle so we will see each other around town and community events. Is there any excuse I can use that would make the quitting not hurt as bad. Do narcissists like to be white lied to? I think they do. Especially if I say like, \"you deserve a better worker, I will stay until you find one who is not so old, my back is playing up.\" Or I could say \"I have just been offered a fulltime job at the library, it's such a good opportunity- I'm sorry I'm going to have to take it.\"",

        "text": "It was in the winter of 2006 that I started learning about emotional incest. I was way too young to completely understand all the details, but I understood that there was something called Narcissism and that my father is a narcissist.\n\n\nIn 2008 my father came after me with a knife and I escaped my house. Lived far away from home for many years until I moved back when he passed away in 2014. That’s when I came to realize that my brother is also a narcissist just like my dad. Scary, I know because in 2015 my brother also tried to come after me with a knife. There is a police record against each of their actions. \n\n\nBut this is what’s really starting to bother me now…One person that I least expected could be a part of this abuse gang was my mom. But from my recent analysis and going over the kind of things she has done to me in the past, I am starting to realize that she herself could be a covert narcissist.\n\n\n\nIt has been nothing but drama with my mother. Here are some things that raised the red flags when I was making a list about her. She still denies that my father and brother have done any wrong doings. She also goes one step further and blames “me” for what happened even though I am the one who does “Everything” for her, including consoling her on a daily basis. She forces me to stay in childlike state by doing everything for me including buying even the tissue paper for bathroom. She minimizes and makes fun of the period I stayed away (ran away) from the family by saying “oh it was only for 6 years” in a mocking tone. When my father died, I still remember her asking me to sleep in “her” bed. During that period, she also repeatedly asked me to rub her feet with Vicks. I refused to do it every time she asked me.\n\n\n\nMy life is bad enough knowing that both my father and brother are narcissists. I still would rather have the truth though. Could it be possible that my mother is also a (covert) narcissist? I went through a difficult financial situation in the past year and she mocked me over and over in regards to my status which also has hurt me. There are many other things she has done which I am not including here, but one thing I can say is that she is always acting like a victim and I don’t think that’s the truth.\n\n",

It was a huge relieve, however a lot of bad things have happened since: being spied, reported as missing person, diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety etc. I’ve been living in fear. My parents are wealthy and have all the funds to do all the crazy stuffs such as finding out my workplace and sending me threats— which as a result I have left my job and I’m currently unemployed. \n\n**My biggest issue and fear at the moment:\nI’m currently living in the UK on student visa, have been living here for 5 years for my undergraduate and postgraduate study… and my visa is about to expire at the end of the month. **\n\nI had been so tired of this issue with my parents, tired of living, tired of trying… therefore I never really bothered to try look for a permanent employment so I could switch to work visa once I’ve graduated… until I met my partner early last year. Life became more bearable- although I’m still facing terrifying nightmares everyday. My partner encouraged me to work on my startup ideas and etc. I managed to do some part-time job, and live pay check to pay check.\n\nI haven’t been able to secure myself a permanent position, so I knew at some point I’d have to leave the UK and apply for a visitor visa back home. This is not something that I’d want to deal with. My parents are too powerful. What if they manage to find me etc… therefore I’ve ignored this for several months. \n\nIt’s mid of January now and my visa will expire at the end of the month. I’ve no money.\n\nI’d love to just go back home and return to the UK with a visitor visa- whilst looking for a job or set up enough funding to begin my business… however my situation is: \n\n(1) I can’t afford to go back home and apply for visitor visa, \n(2) I’ve no friends or family back home to whom I can stay with whilst I’m there (can’t afford to pay for accommodation), \n(3) I don’t speak the local language (so I can more or less work a wee bit to afford stuffs).\n(4) I don’t want to involve my partner in this matter as we have just known each other for nearly a year- including borrowing money.\n\nWhat if I overstay by a few weeks, just so I can gather enough fund to get a return flight, enough money for a visitor visa and accommodation back home?\n\nI seriously would have just stayed here as an illegal immigrant, but I care for my partner and I want us to have a future here in the UK. \n\nOne more question- would it be possible if I apply for a visitor visa from somewhere else other than my home country? (fear of being in danger if I were to go back home/ my parents have strong relationship with the government and I’m afraid of being tracked &amp; found).\n\nCan anyone who specialises in immigration issue help?",

        "text": "For four years, I've tried dealing with my husband's emotionally abusive, manipulative, and narcissistically-headed family.\n\nThey hated me at first sight because they could see I was their son's first glimpse at real love (without abuse or strings attached) and normalcy. They tried their hardest to get rid of me, but when that didn't work, they \"accepted\" me.\n\nI believed that they loved us for a while. We even moved 10mins from my MIL, FIL, SIL, and BIL for two years.\n\nI learned, finally, that the \"love\" and affection they showed to me was simply because they knew if they didn't, they wouldn't see their son (my husband) and that they were using their affection so that when they later abused me verbally, or when I found out their lies, I wouldn't run and I'd want to believe they really cared for me. Just like they did to my husband his entire life.\n\nWe now see that they are not capable of what the action of loving someone requires: trust, respect, honour, and putting their needs before your own.\n\nThey use us because we were weak for so long and gullible and they each get comfort in causing each other pain, bringing each other down to keep each other around like a child and their favourite blanket. I see it as a kid tearing up their comfort blanket, not caring that it is destroyed, as long as they can keep dragging it along everywhere with them.\n\n They make every day a new drama and every week filled with backstabbing and senseless fights, because they are miserable people who refuse to change and aren't capable of it, at this point.\n\nIt's tiring and now we have moved states away, gotten new phones, and deleted social media so they have no way to attack anymore and we are free...\n\nbut it's not easy. we both are filled with guilt when we have memories of the good times, even though we KNOW that the bad outweighs the good. we both keep trying to think \"what if we were wrong?\" because for years they all tried to take the blame off of themselves, saying their family was the way to be and everyone else was the problem.\n\nI feel guilt because I am putting my husband through the pain of his wife being no contact with his family. I feel guilt because I see how hard it is for him to do this, even though he as an individual sees how horrible they are overall and wants to get away from them.\n\nHe told me that he would've had to cut ties eventually if he ever wanted to be free from the abusive, oppressive family, even if he had never met me. But part of me still feels like I made things worse because they hate me so much.\n\nIt's also hard because part of us both still wants to believe they really do love us and aren't just keeping us around to use as their playthings to mock and belittle... it's conflicting. the years of emotional abuse has us doubting ourselves constantly when trying to get away.\n\nWe tried asking them to stop the abuse; that would work for a minute and then they'd just do it behind our backs and we would find out. Either that, or when we would ask they'd cry and get offended and say we were being too sensitive.\n\nWe tried setting clear boundaries and telling them we would not put up with certain behaviour. They just got sneakier, did it anyways, and when they were found out, would either lie or just simply continue the behaviours and manipulate us into putting up with it out of guilt.\n\nWe tried just doing what they wanted every day, making sure to either call and text enough or go to their house enough to keep them from saying we were selfish, favouring the other siblings blatantly, or crying saying we don't care about the family enough. Even this didn't work because when we talked or went over, shit would still hit the fan and jabs were still thrown around.\n\nIt honestly seems that at this point, no contact is all we have to get away from it. We recognise that now it is a battle within ourselves to quit feeling nostalgia and love toward them, and recognise the behaviour as wrong and unchanging, and move on with our lives. But it's so much easier said than done...\n\nEspecially when I have good memories and see my husband in pain from missing his family and realising we won't be involved even on their death beds. (because they are the types that when you cross them and quit serving a purpose for them or bringing them comfort and ass kissing, you're out of the game on the lowest tier getting spit on)\n\nWe cannot afford a counsellor right now, either. We literally just up and moved, they have most of our stuff (never getting that back, their house is covered in cat piss and spray, as well as a SIL and BIL who like to destroy and hide our stuff, which I'm fine with losing it all just to get away from the abuse) \n\nWe want to be free of them and this sadness and guilt. We want to not repeat the patterns each of them has in place, and we want to treat each other with love and respect that they can't give. We don't want marriages like theirs, and we certainly don't want to repeat their parenting methods. We don't want them ever to meet or even know about our future children, in hopes we can give them a life without going through what they put my husband through.\n\nSo I'm on this website hoping to find others who understand and can help us see if these things we are feeling are normal and if we can ever really get through this and if it's worth it to break free, or if we should've just kept putting up with them.\n\ntl;dr just another case of someone trying to recover from years of emotional abuse and manipulation by narcissists and their feeders, who needs help and advice on the subject!",

Here are some things I have done so far.\n\n* 1.\tPut my laptop away from my bed.\n* 2.\tPut my cell phone on my desk far from where I sleep\n* 3.\tInstalled black out curtains.\n* 4.\tStopped eating 2 hours before sleep\n\nEverything looks good , but I am still not able to go to sleep at the correct time nor wake up at an early time since I am not getting enough sleep.\n\nIt struck me today that I am tossing and turning in my bed every morning around 6 a.m and filled with anxiety around that time. Unfortunately, that’s around the time my narcissistic brother goes to work and I realized that I am waking  up at 6 am randomly because I feel like I am in some kind of danger even though it’s been 3 months since I last spoke to him after his latest verbal attack on me. Could this be a reason why my sleep cycle is so messed up ? I am currently doing freelance and I am looking for a new job, but I know I won’t be productive at my work if my sleep cycle is all over the place.  \nI noticed myself in my half-sleep mode that I am noticing every move he makes from him waking up in his room to opening his door with force to getting in shower to closing his shower curtain with force . Then I notice him getting out of the shower , getting dressed and putting on his shoes and I pay special attention to how he close the door ( whether it’s loud or mild ) because he has a tendency to slam it hard just like my narcissistic father used to do . But this is absurd. Why am I paying attention to all this stupid minute idiotic stuff when I should be sleeping and focusing on bettering my life? I am sick of my life. I am getting abused even without him directly abusing me and waking up at 12:00 noon every day because of this pattern.\n",

        "text": "Hello folks:\n\nI have decided that I want to reduce contact with my narc parents. However, I am not sure about the best way to go about this. Cutting contact with them completely has crossed my mind several times. But I have been hesitant to do this for some reason. I will give you a back story and describe my current circumstances to you as clearly as I can.\n\n\nBefore I enlisted 8 years ago, I was in university taking a business program. This was my father's idea. My father pushed me into doing it even though I was interested in other stuff at the time. At the time I was mildly interested in policing and auto mechanics but never really had a chance to explore other options. My career was hastily chosen after a week. It was a case of doing what he wanted or not getting any support at all. I struggled through university, especially the required finance/accounting courses (I had to retake them because I failed them the first time around). My father knew I was having a hard time with them. I don't know why he was so surprised and angry when I failed them. I managed to stick through it and barely graduate, but I knew business wasn't for me. He was I kick myself every day for giving in to him and being too much of a chicken to stand up to him. Hence the reason I enlisted. It seemed like a good way to escape.\n\n\nSo I live on the west coast because I was stationed here when I was in the military (I chose to do this is get some distance from my family). My entire family lives in eastern Canada. I finished my service 2 years ago, but I am still living in the same city I was stationed in. However, I don't see myself staying here long term. I love the west coast. The problem is:\n\n\n- The city I live in is getting increasingly expensive.\n- You have to be well-connected to get a job better than minimum wage here. It can take a while to even find full-time work here (I have an anonymous addiction fellowship that I go to but they can't help me find better work).\n- Outside of my addiction group, I don't have any support network. I could move closer to family, but that would be a double-edged sword.\n- My cash flow situation is pretty tight right now. I am living a frugally as possible, working part-time, and treading water. I am having a hard time motivating myself to find a second or better job.\n\n\nI have enough in savings/retirement to go back to school if I wanted. I don't have any debt either. However, I have been having a hard time deciding what to take. For the past two years I have been stuck in a loop of analysis paralysis. I am afraid of picking the wrong thing and being miserable for the rest of my life. I don't have a specific career in mind, but what I do know for certain is this:\n\n\n- Science/engineering/tech is an area that I lean toward.\n- Over the past decade, I learned what aspects of daily work life that I like/don't like.\n\n\nIt doesn't help that my narc father keeps sending me e-mails about finance and accounting jobs. Even though I have been VERY explicit with him for years about not being interested in finance/accounting, he still feels I will love it. My narc father tryed getting his CGA years ago but gave up on it on his last semester. So I feel like he is constantly treating me like an extension of himself. He also likes giving me unsolicited advice and e-mailing me bible verses. We have already had a lot of fights over the phone about this. He goes on a lot of guilt trips when I call him out on it. I eventually accepted that arguing with him is futile because he is always right and I am always wrong. \n\n\nAfter seeing therapists and examining my life over the last 20 years, there have been several other incidents that have eroded my trust in my parents. I have also been working on undoing my cynicism, self-esteem, and social anxiety issues. I feel like I don't have anyone in my corner. If you need more background about me and my situation, here is a link to a thread I posted two months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/789t4t/do_children_of_nc_parents_often_end_up_not_having/\n\n\nIf you have read this far, THANK YOU SO MUCH for hearing me out! So now that you know my background and current situation, I need a plan of attack. So my questions are:\n\n- How should I go about making future career plans in spite of my own depression and my parents tormenting me?\n\n- If I decide to reduce contact/no contact, I anticipate that my parents might go on a smear campaign. My parents know this. I am worried that they might make a false police report or something to try to control me. Would talking to the police/lawyer about this be a bad idea at this point?\n\nThat is all I can think of right now (Yeah I have a lot on my mind haha). If you have any other suggestions, I am all ears.\n\nJames",

        "text": "Hello, I have been looking through reddit hoping to find an appropriate  place to share my question. If this is not appropriate for this subreddit, I apologize I would appreciate being pointed in the correct direction.\n\nI have been married, for a number of years, to a man that seems to possibly be a narcissist or at least has narcissistic tendencies. \nIt is impossilbe to get him to see any side of an issue other than his. \nToday, I actually wrote down, point by point, what I need to discuss with him. He found a way to make me \"wrong\" or even to discount things that actually took place. This happens all of the time. It is the reason I wrote down what I wanted to talk to him about. \nHe failed to discuss something important with one of our daughters. I left it to him because the issue was related to his family. I told him repeatedly that she needed to hear what was happening from him. He never acknowledged that he was wrong. He just made excuses and made it seem as if I was making a big deal out of nothing. This is something every member of her family knew except for her. I felt she had the right to know and that he should have told her. \nI do not think that I am right all of the time. I do feel that I should be able to discuss what I have to say without everything I say being minimized or belittled. I feel so beaten down everytime. I want to leave him and I think I should probably. I am sick and his job has my health insurance. It is the wrong reason to stay but I honestly don't know what I would do without care. \n\nHe minimizes and turns everything around. It always ends up being my fault or it did not happen as I recount it.\n\nI do not know how to do a TL DR but to sum up, I think my husband is a narcissist or at least has narcissistic tendencies and I don't know how to cope.",

        "text": "I'm the oldest of 3. My younger siblings are 4 and 6 years younger than me (25). All of the \"oldest child\" stereotypes- overly responsible, always trying to help other people, etc. - were and are extreme in my personality. I now have very severe almost strictly obsessive OCD. Can't completely blame my upbringing, as my mother and grandmother have anxiety disorders as well. \nFirst of all, I'm so grateful that my siblings and I have remained close into adulthood. Growing up we fought *a lot.* Not just the three of us, but my parents as well. Any grouping of us 5 were going at it at any given time. But all 3 of us have seen and realized \"they are crazy, not us.\" Even my brother who has struggled with drug addiction for years. I've seen that shit tear siblings apart, but I'm so glad my sister and I haven't made him out to be the scapegoat the same way my mother has. Even though they both still live with my alcoholic mother (who has-knock on wood- as of lately been... Normal?), they *know* she's crazy, they know its not their fault. \n\n\n\n\n When I was younger, around 10, my biggest dream was to grow up, have a grown up life with a house and car, and adopt my brother and sister. At some point I suppose I realized that by the time that happened, they would be grown up too, and my dreams shifted towards motherhood. (Still not there yet.. Need to work a bit on achieving the grown up life first.) But those feelings remained. Even now that we're all adults, theres a part of me that feels like a half-sister half-mother to them. I try to do the things my mother never thought to do for them. I always felt like I should have done more though. Like if I had done better, my sister would learn how to drive or save her money. I try to teach her as well as I know, but I'm still learning some of these things too. My heart breaks for my brother, who is doing well now, but when he is struggling, I just wish I could have done more to help. I know this isnt my responsibility, and is probably inappropriate for a sibling relationship. But who else is going to teach and guide them in this world? Sometimes when we discuss things, politics, worldviews, etc. they parrot things back to me that I've said to them before. It makes me wonder and hope, maybe I have had some sort of influence on them after all.",

        "text": "I am 35 years old and due to some bad financial circumstances and my narc father’s passing away, I am living with my mother currently. I am seeking for a new job and planning to move out as soon as I can. I am very grateful for her allowing me to stay here. But as time is passing by, some of the painful  things my mother did over the years are coming to my mind like a flash back.\n\n\nFor example, back in 2008 my father came after me with a knife and I had to call the cops on him. It was a heavily emotional situation and I still remember that phone call with my mother where she kept repeating things like “the whole family has rejected you”, “he (my father) was not going to kill you”,”it was a knife he was using to scratch his back” etc etc. Basically she denied my side of the story completely. She took my father’s side and was also a primary force in kicking me out of the house because I called the cops on him.\n\nTo this day she denies that it was his fault and blames me for what happened. Fast forward to 2015 , which is when I moved back home after almost a decade of living away from my family with no contact.\n\n\nMy brother got extremely violent and used to abuse me for absolutely no reason and one day he came after me with a knife just like my father did. I reported it to the cops and they send him a letter for criminal misdemeanor. I didn’t follow up on it or anything, but to this day my mother keeps repeating to me every time I bring that up by saying “Oh he was never going to kill you”. “It’s all in your head” etc. It’s almost like she is on the other side. Meanwhile, me like an idiot buys into her story and allows the abuse to continue. \n\n\nEvery time my brother abuses me at home and we stop talking, my mother is the one who always tries to initiate the “peace treaty” and sucks me back into the abusive cycle. I am putting an end to it. Even though we live under the same roof, I have decided to never reignite my relationship with my brother again, no matter what my mother says because I am starting to realize that she might not be doing this for my benefit. I am thinking that as soon as I get a job, I should move out. I have forgiven her and will still support her, but I don’t think I am obligated to continue a relationship especially when she is denying my side of the story of how my own father and brother picked up a weapon to kill me. I wonder how I can help her with me being away since she always wants me to play the parent role and I am resigning from that post. \n",
