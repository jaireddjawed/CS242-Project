        "text": "Ok so this is a long story with a lot of twists and turns. Everyone here is at fault to a certain extent. So this all started a handful of years ago. I had been friends with my best friend, let’s call him Brian for the purpose of this story. Brian and I met through a mutual friend and quickly became close. A few months after we became friends, I met this girl, let’s call her Megan for the story. Me and Megan had known each other through school, but weren’t super close before this. Me and her began snapping and eventually fell for each other. We were both madly in love and got along perfectly. Eventually I start going out with her, and I notice Brian becoming super jealous of our relationship. I decided to introduce him to Megan via snapchat and they got along. Everything in my relationship with Megan is going well for about 5 or 6 months until out of the blue one of her friends advised me she had been talking to another guy from the next town over. Needless to say, I am devastated and I quickly confront Megan and break things off with her. I also find out the guy she’s talking to and send a less than friendly message his way. Unbeknownst to me, Brian had been talking to Megan all along as well. The two of them related on a lot of things, such as personal experiences, family conflicts, etc. Eventually I find out they’re becoming friends and naturally I get upset, as my best friend was getting all buddy-buddy with the girl who betrayed me. Eventually, Brian attempts to end his friendship with Megan, but she claims that he has helped her through her depression and claims he is the only person who understands her (things didn’t work out with the guy she cheated with ironically enough) Brian agrees to continue to be friends with her and admits that he has feelings for her. She rejects him, but the two continue to be close friends and speak of personal matters. Somewhere along the lines, things go sour between the two of them. Brian becomes depressed because of Megan not wishing to date him and I witness him becoming an absolute train wreck, saying how she is the only girl for him so on and so forth. Eventually, Megan cuts Brian off completely and ends all contact with him. A few months pass and Brian is back in good spirits. I tell him it’s a good thing he moved on and that Megan is a bad person and we both can do better. He told me that Megan’s rejection and torment of him had made him s*icidal at times. I was absolutely upset after hearing this, and I felt so terrible for letting her come into his life in the first place. After another couple months, Brian admits that he is feeling for Megan again and wishes to start talking to her again. Mind you Megan went around telling all her friends how terrible of a person Brian is and calls him all sorts of things like a simp, loser, etc. I immediately tell Brian that he should not talk to her again because after seeing the pain she caused him, I couldn’t bear the sight of seeing him like that again, if not even worse. He is insistent that she is a good person and will welcome him back into her life. I’m becoming stressed and have to act before Brian gets himself into another bad situation and possibly ends up in a bad place. So I come up with a lie. A half baked lie that I blurt out to him. I told him that Megan never really existed and the entire time he had been talking to her, it say was an elaborate prank by another friend of mine. To my surprise, he actually believes it and is understandably pissed. I apologize, but He stops talking to me for a week or so and eventually forgives me. As bad as it sounds, I’d rather this then have him talking to Megan again and have the same thing happen where he ends up super depressed and possibly hurting himself. After a couple months, we become close friends again and put the entire situation behind us. Fast forward a few years and Megan and I begin talking again. We hadn’t seen each other for a while and are both in our own walks of life. She and I are talking just like old times and she wants a relationship. But if that happens it could potentially be the end of my friendship with Brian (we’re still close friends now) part of me wants to just tell him the long and painful truth but it would almost be better not too considering how badly Megan hurt him. Either way I feel like a complete A-Hole.",

        "text": "Hi, I'm [F16] and i continually ruin my life, for no real reason. Does this actually count as a confession? I dunno. \n\nI don't like to admit it, as obviously it's a massive flaw, but I purposely put myself in bad situations for the sake of attention, and sometimes for no reason at all. Right and wrong have always been cloudy for me, I've just had a pretty awful life, I'm kind to people but I'm definitely not a good person, and honestly I feel like my life is over, like I've lived so much that the thought of knowing I have more life to live in exhausting. I'm a attention seeking, love addicted, loser who can't help but do the literal opposite of what I should do while being fully aware it's a bad idea. \n\nBefriend bad people? Yea sure whatever! Forgive people who have hurt me (minus family)? Of course, get back in my life! Seek attention from obviously awful people? Sure, rather be hurt again than be alone! Purposely ignore health issues? Yea sure why not! Have good friendships/relationships going? Fucking ruin it as soon as possible, speedrun that shit! Be fully aware of the consequences of my actions and doing said actions anyway? Fuck it, nothing better than being my own downfall apparently! Post this confession as a cry for help and a cry for attention? You bet! \n\nWhat's crazy is I don't even know who I am anymore, I change depending on who I'm involved with, so if I had to explain myself I'd say: I'm someone who has a constant identity crisis. a strong craving for love and attention that to a point is self-ruining. I can't hang out with people my age because I'm so different than them, I'm mature for my age while being immature. I'm overly emotional and emotionally void. My traumas aren't my fault but it is my fault I willingly let my problems get worse. I'm honest but I feel like a liar. I will be the cause of my ultimate downfall. \n\nTo sum up my confession, I can't help but willingly ruin my life, I can't allow myself to be happy or stable, thus I feel equal parts guilt and acceptance that I'm horrible and have done/continue to do horrible things that ruin mine, and probably other people's life. I have been used, abused, and tossed but I have also used, abused, and tossed others in the past.",

        "text": "I was thinking about my childhood lately, and realised I was incredibly screwed up. Everything I mention here is over 20 years ago now, and all when I was below the age of criminal responsibility.\n\nFirst of all, I liked to kill insects. I would pick up ants from the garden, and let them crawl around on my hand for a bit, while talking to them about how their life was about to end, and I was about to kill them. \n\nSecond, I tried to kill family members on two occassions. I attempted to set my uncle on fire, and attempted to smother my younger sister. Both attempts thankfully failed, and the uncle I tried to kill ended up abusing his wife, so my family jokes that I somehow saw through him as a kid.\n\nAnother thing I did is, sometimes I would take younger kids and restrain them. I would tell them that I was going to take them away from their parents, and that they'd never see them again. I'd restrain them in place and tell them this for a bit, then eventually let them go. I worry that I may have scarred people for life by doing that.\n\nI don't know what was wrong with me, whether something happened to me that I repressed, or if I was just born like that. I grew out of it, and ended up as a normal adult. I hate the idea of hurting animals enough that I even became vegetarian. But jesus, when I think back to how I was as a kid, I wonder if my mom had an affair with a demon or something.",

It hasn't done anything obviously other than the occasional \"howdy\" instead of \"hello\". And during my interview I didn't have an accent so I'll occasionally use my normal voice to talk to customers who aren't very good at English in front of my manager so they know that sometimes I do just talk like that so people can hear me clearly. That way it's not suspicious.\nThere's genuinely no reason for me to be doing this.\nBut now it's so far gone that I can't really stop. Looking into getting a new job partly because of this. I don't know if I can keep talking in the southern accent every single day, they started having me work full-time. It can be kind of draining at times to keep the gig up... Because I do not have a Southern accent at all.",

No sabria decir que tanto, usualmente le solia venir el periodo cada fin de mes. Sin embargo pasó algo similar a lo de ahora y le empezó a bajar a mitad de mes.\n\nMuchos dirán que un hijo es regalo del cielo o algo así, no lo dudo. Pero en nuestra relación ninguno quería un hijo nunca, pero esa no es la razón de estar asustado.\n\nElla tiene quince años y yo cumplo la mayoría de edad a finales de este año(18 en mi país). Ese es el otro problema, vivo en Venezuela.\n\n Ella está cursando el cuarto año del liceo o preparatoria y yo voy a empezar la universidad. Temo haberle arruinado la vida con esto, no me preocupa tanto mi persona. Ella no ha vivido cosas normales de jóvenes porque sus padres son muy prohibitivos y de seguro un hijo no hará más que empeorarlo todo. \n\nEs obvio que no seguiré el ejemplo del padre latino promedio y me quedaré a afrontarlo todo a su lado. La amo mucho y no  la abandonaría por nada. Espero que mi siguiente actualización sean buenas noticias para mí al menos.\n\nMe hice esta cuenta porque siento que los streamers famosos o los youtubers, o cualquier influencer, en realidad no están solos. Si tienen un mal día van a su comunidad y esta los apoya. Es lo que estoy buscando aquí, alguien que pueda ayudarme. No económicante, aunque en realidad lo necesite. Más bien apoyo emocional, alguien para hablar o alguien que haya pasado por lo mismo. AYUDA.",

Not only was she a neurologist, but she was also a psychiatrist. In working out a treatment plan, she became aware my marriage wasn't the best. With that knowledge and the fact that I work in healthcare (she was concerned if the disease my impact, how I interact with patients) she recommended that I see a mental health professional. Which I did right away. After a while, the drug therapy it was on became less effective. At that point, she recommended physical intervention. I had a minor outpatient brain procedure that left me in increased pain and emotional wreck. After that reached out to one of the best neurosurgeons in the country to discuss next steps. They immediately set up an appointment, and I had hope. A few days later, they canceled the appointment, saying I had waited to long for them to take me on as a patient. That pushed me over the edge of the cliff. I sat in my house alone and began contemplating ways to commit suicide. The only thing that stopped me is I didn't want my dogs to eat my body. That gave me pause to get the help I needed and keep me from going over the cliff.",
