        "text": "I’m trying to figure out if there is a benefit to compressing a gas, heating it, and letting it expand to do work. As a ratio of work done to compress the gas compared to work done by expansion of the gas, it seems best mathematically (most efficient) to not compress the gas at all and just let it expand from heat starting from 1 atm. My primitive math is showing diminishing returns with increased compression and then it gets locked at about 1 unit to compress to 2 units work done by expansion after heat. \n\nHere’s a way to define the question:\nWill compressing a gas to 1/10Volume, heating it, and letting it expand to a volume of 2 create more work per cycle but less efficiently (work in to work out) than not compressing the gas (or slight compression to avoid a 0 in the math) at 1volume and letting it expand to a volume of 2? In terms of work in to work out does compression lead to efficiency? \n\nI am comparing Stirling and Brayton cycles, getting confused. Thank you.",

It really lit a fire under me to get what I deserve. I'll post the story here for those interested. Perhaps you can learn something.\n\nWhen I posted the original post I had not really crawled out from under the rock I was living beneath. Reading the responses shocked me. I started talking to people in software and reading more on reddit and career websites. I even talked to a friend, who said he basically did nothing, made 120K base salary, and with my skillset/knowledge I could be his boss. When I looked at my accomplishments I realized that I was a really really good engineer. There was a question asked in the first reddit post of whether or not it was my personality or character flaws that led to me being in my position. I quickly realized that the reason I was in the situation I was in was all my fault. It boiled down to willful ignorance and a severe case of impostor syndrome. I had completely failed myself and my family by not advocating for myself.\n\nI began job searching immediately. I figured I needed a good benchmark so I applied to Amazon and took an online leetcode assessment. I failed it miserably and realized that to get to where I wanted, I was going to have to leetcode. So I started the grind for a few weeks. I updated my resume. I asked friends to critique it. I rewrote it. I bought cracking the coding interview and read it.\n\nBut then life happened. My spouse quit their job. We moved. There were holidays. We bought a house and moved again. During this time I had to stop the job search just to keep everything running. I also turned a hobby into a business, which brings in just over $1K/mo.\n\nOnce we were settled in the new house for a few months and things normalized I decided to start the job hunt again. At the peak, I grinded leetcode for almost a month straight in all of my free time. My spouse was very sad from rarely spending time with me, but they knew it would be worth it in the end.\n\nThe first offer I received was from a small but quickly growing company with an offer of $135K annual comp. I immediately told my employer I was leaving and they came back in less than 24 hours with a matching offer! I honestly wasn't expecting them to do that. But I turned it down. I heard horror stories of people accepting the counter only to be replaced a few months later and fired. I also knew that I no longer was interested in working there anymore.\n\nThankfully, soon after, I ended up getting an offer from one of the big tech companies for $138K. I knew based on Levels.FYI that it was a lowball offer. So I asked for more. The recruiter was extremely unprofessional, which caused a lot of stress. I figured that since I was on a journey of learning how to advocate for myself it didn't make much sense to roll over and accept this low offer, even if it was all I had on the table. I reported the recruiter to HR and they assigned me a new recruiter, who increased the offer to 150K. During this time (3 weeks) I finished an interview process at another company that ended up offering me 160K, which I gladly accepted.\n\nI'll have 3 weeks between employers to spend quality time with my wife and enjoy my hobbies. I'll be starting a new job with exciting work doing exactly what I want to do with my career. The benefits are mind-bogglingly good. My spouse no longer has to worry about health issues because we have the best insurance you can imagine. The retirement benefits are over double what big tech gives. I'll be given the creative freedom and authority to make a huge impact on the business. My monthly take-home pay has doubled. And most importantly, I'll be my own advocate from day 1.\n\nIn summary, here's what I learned:\n\nMost companies do not care about their employees. So don't make the mistake of caring about your employer more than they care about you.\nYou are your own best advocate. If you have a family, you also must advocate for them. This journey affected a ton of relationships my spouse and I have. It didn't just affect my career. We are currently still in process of realigning those relationships, closing ones that are sucking the life out of us, and creating new ones that bring us joy. The bad news is if you don't like where you're at in your life, it's no one's fault but your own. The good news is, you have the power to change your life.\nDuring the stressful experience with the unprofessional recruiter, I had to consult a lot of people. Strangers, acquaintances, and close friends. Their input was extremely helpful to navigating the situation with professionalism and tact while not burning any bridges. Be humble and get advice. Someone else has been where you are.\nLeetcode sucks. Companies assign way too much value to these technical assessments. I accept that I can't change the recruitment processes overnight. So I put my head down and did what I had to do. But I hope someone figures out a better way.\nDo not waste time with HR. They exist to protect the company, not you.\nKnowledge is power. Know what the companies pay. Learn how to negotiate. Get a competing offer. DO NOT SETTLE.\nThanks to everyone who commented, challenged, and encouraged me. I hope this story helps you if you're stuck in a dead-end job. The software job market is hot right now. I don't want to minimize the amount of hard work and sacrifices I had to put in to accomplish this. It was hard. But my spouse and I are extremely excited for what the future holds. It is worth it.\n\nEdit: I was making $85k in the second highest cost of living location in the US. I am now making $160K in a low cost of living city in the Southeast US.",

        "text": "Alright, a bit of a weird one I suppose, but I'm 100% serious about it so bear with me here:\n\nSome time ago, I inherited a small sliver of very rural land. It's roughly 20' x 30', kind of a joke parcel from someone else' property division that ended up being cut in half by a road expansion. \n\nIt does have a few trees on it, so it is nice to stop by and hang out when you're passing through (I'm thinking about putting a bench in), and I can go and pitch a tent there and camp if I want to disregard proximity to the street. I could probably clear cut it and put two 20' shipping containers on it side by side for storage but otherwise not much potential. Property taxes are like $50 a year because it's useless, so that's not an issue, I could pay the taxes yearly with scrapped aluminum cans. It's not buildable, so no structures can be put on it - however, I *can* put a grave there. \n\nSo what I'm thinking is this: I want to put in my will that upon my death, I am to be buried at the foot of the largest tree on the property, with a fairly robust topper/pad positioned overtop of my coffin. When motorcyclists are passing through, if they want to pitch a tent for a night on their way, they can stop and camp, but only if they nudge the front wheel up against my headstone and do a sick smokey burnout on top of my grave.\n\nIt seems to me that the kind of unique roadside attractions that you used to be able to find in rural areas of the US are becoming more rare, so I'd like to contribute to Americana by kind of becoming one myself when I'm dead. I'm thinking about going to a lawyer to start drafting up a will and planning this out sometime within the next few months, so now I'm thinking about materials.\n\nAssuming that cost isn't really a problem, what would be the best material for a burnout pad? Preferably, I'd be looking for something that could offer some friction to generate smoke, but also be durable enough to survive that kind of abuse for as long as possible. I'm considering high-strength concrete (if you've got suggestions or ideas for mixes or inclusions to enhance durability) or perhaps a granite slab, but am also open to other suggestions.",

It’s a fairly narrow building located on a very busy portion of the highway (see photos) with lots of trucks and buses going in both directions.\n\nThere’s slight swaying similar at times to what I’ve felt in light tremors in earthquakes. Sometimes it’s strong enough to wake me but nothing shifts around or rattles in the apartment. See the video of the jugs shaking. It’s pretty constant throughout the day and night. I also downloaded a seismometer app on my phone (not sure how accurate a phone app can be), but it’s saying IV intensity using USGS scale. \n\nIt is a new building and was constructed just over a year ago. I think it may be steel construction. I don’t see any cracks in the stairwells or in the apartment.  \n\n**Do you think this is highly abnormal and dangerous?

Part of my job is to assure that we fit as much product as possible in this container, and that I know ahead of time (with as much precision as possible) which items/pallets/crates/gaylords will be going in the container. I also must see to it that on the day of loading the container (within a 2 hour window) that there are no surprises or last minute amendments/exclusions of items. Because the assortment of non-standard sized crates, single pallets, pallets with gaylords stacked 2 high, and awkwardly shaped large parts overhanging their pallets, it's hard to calculate which pallets/crates/gaylord stacks should be paired together and in what order they should be loaded into the container. For now I've started by taping out the container dimensions on the warehouse floor so that I can stage the goods in a mock container ahead of time. It seems like I could spend hours painstakingly measuring all of the irregular dimensions of each individual pallet/crate/gaylord and other non-standard items which overhang some of the pallets, crunching numbers in a spreadsheet, and drawing mockups in Sketchup or similar 3D modeling program, to reduce the time I'm on the forklift playing Tetris with the actual goods. Or I could just skip the measuring and play tetris with all the large heavy pallets for hours until I call it good enough. No matter how I go about this it seems it will be time and labor intensive, and I'm curious if there might be a way to enlist the help of 3D scanning/computer vision, computer aided measurement, or any other automation tools, which could speed up the process and increase accuracy. Is it possible, with the latest iPhone for instance, to scan each of my crates/pallets/gaylords and extract from the scans measurements accurate within 1\"? For the awkward/complex items overhanging pallets I don't require a high degree of detail in the smaller bits of the parts, just an fairly accurate measurement of the outer most protruding dimensions. Additionally, once I have the scans and dimension (or dimensions from manual measurements) are there any tools in the form of software, scripts, etc where I could input the container dimension constraints and the dimensions (or scans) of all pallets/crates/gaylords, and have the program output a packing configuration that optimizes space to fit the maximum amount of goods within the container? This sounds pretty complex and advanced beyond what I have seen accomplished with these type of tools, so I'm not entirely hopeful that this already exists, at least without having to spend a lot of time stringing together my own customized workflow, which wouldn't be very efficient for a one off project. If anything does exist that could assist in either the: 1. scanning 2. measurement, or 3. spacial optimization stages of this process, such that it would save me a decent amount of time, or yield a more cost/labor/space optimized solution, then I would be thrilled. Apologies if this isn't the right sub, happy to delete and post elsewhere if you have suggestions. Thanks in advance for any ideas or feedback.",

        "text": "When talking about engineering topics, knowing the precise technical name for a device or material is half the battle.\n\nWhat is the technical name for an electrically conductive long narrow strip of polymer film that is about 5 cm wide, 1 to 10 meters long, not coated with an adhesive, with moderate resistance to stretching and deformation at room temperature, and can tolerate many cycles of flexing before it either stress-breaks or sheds the conductive coating?\n\n* \"tape\" seems to be close, but I don't want it to be sticky.\n* \"film\" is apparently a wide roll... at least 25 cm wide.\n* \"ribbon\" conjures up images of parties and balloons, with a sparkly or mirrored finish.\n* \"reel\" just means something is wound onto a spool, it doesn't say anything about width.\n\nA brand name for metallized conductive plastic that comes to mind is \"Mylar\" but it could be other types as well.\n\nThe technical definitions are weird since there is videotape and audiotape but it is not adhesive, yet most other forms of reel tape are adhesive ..",
