        "text": "Polycoria is an extremely rare eye condition in which an iris contains two pupils. Before the summer of 2022, I didn’t even know that an eye could have double pupils. You might be in the same boat, given that there have only been two recorded cases of *true* polycoria since 1966, supposedly.\n\nWhy am I telling you about an obscure type of eye defect? Well, I’ve been conducting research on the topic. I need to understand what happened at my great aunt’s mansion out in the sticks. I thought that finding an answer would ease the gnawing knot of terror in my chest, but no rational explanation seemed to suffice. Not even the textbook definition of polycoria explained what I saw.\n\nMy father’s side of the family is essentially non-existent, due to some terrible childhood event that he hasn’t ever discussed. Only he and his aunt, Audrey, survived. We used to be visited by her when we were little, but she has grown sicker and sicker with every passing year, so we finally went on a family trip to see her in the summer of 2022.\n\n“Why do we have to drive *all* of the way to Scotland?” My younger sister, Lisa, moaned.\n\n“I don’t think you’ll be whinging when you see it, Lisa,” My dad laughed. “It makes our house look like a shoebox. It’s a *palace*.”\n\n“In the middle of nowhere,” My little brother, Jacob, muttered under his breath.\n\n“Inverness isn’t the middle of nowhere,” My dad scoffed.\n\n“It’s not *technically* Inverness, though, is it?” I pointed out. “I checked the destination on Google Maps. Audrey’s house is a few miles from the city in a sketchy little place with no name.”\n\n“Come on, everyone! This is an adventure! You’ll be eating your words in a few hours,” My mum said. “You won’t want to go back to Bury.”\n\nShe wasn’t wrong, but I didn’t want to be in Bury *or* Inverness. I wanted to be with my university friends in Manchester. They were all partying before going home for the summer break. I, meanwhile, was cooped up in a car with my irritating siblings and incessantly-peppy parents.\n\n“Red car!” Jacob giggled.\n\n*Thump*. Every time he saw a red car on the motorway, my demonic brother would punch me in the arm. I semi-patiently tolerated the moronic game. Jacob’s eleven-year-old, attention-deficit brain needed *some* sort of stimulation on a six-hour car journey. The alternative would be fidgeting and complaining about the lack of signal on his phone.\n\nBesides, I had ways to entertain myself, too.\n\n“Did you ever hear about the little boy who spoke too much?” I asked.\n\n“Felicity,” My mum warned. “No scaring your brother.”\n\n“I’m not scared of Felicity’s lame-ass ghost stories,” Jacob insisted.\n\n“Oh, this isn’t a story,” I said. “This is something I saw on the news. A little boy drove his older sister to madness. But she was a med student, so she tied him to an operating table, stitched his lips together, and, for good measure, removed his limbs.”\n\n“N-No she didn’t…” Jacob stammered. “You made that up.”\n\nMy brother attempted to maintain his composure, but his trembling voice gave him away.\n\n“If only you had signal to Google it on your phone, eh?” I teased. “Nah, you’re right. I made up the part about the limbs. It makes a gal think, though…”\n\nI eyed up Jacob’s left arm, the weapon that he used for the Red Car game. I slowly stroked my chin, as if I were contemplating how I’d saw off my brother’s culpable limb, given the chance. His face turned pale.\n\n“Come on, Felicity,” My mum sighed. “Enough.”\n\n“Scared, Mum?” I asked, grinning.\n\n“Look outside the window, Felicity,” Lisa said. “There’s something creepier than your story.”\n\nWe’d reached Audrey’s village.\n\nAll five of us silently soaked in the strange little ghost town. It was a time capsule. A perfectly-preserved place. Rusted husks of vehicles from the ‘90s were rotting away on overgrown, weed-covered driveways. The main road was mostly deserted, but there were a few withered wanderers who stopped and suspiciously squinted at the family in the shiny Range Rover. We were out of place, and everybody knew it.\n\n“Does anybody even live here?” Lisa asked, shuddering. “Those people look like ghosts.”\n\n“A lot of folk moved away in the ‘90s,” My dad replied. “Most of the people around here were farmers, and they left when the crop fields started to dry up.”\n\n“I don’t like that they’re all staring at us,” Jacob said, disappearing into his seat.\n\n“Not many people come to these parts,” My dad said. “That’s all.”\n\n“What about your aunt?” Lisa asked. “Why’s she still here?”\n\n“Old money,” My mum chuckled.\n\n“*Very* old money,” My dad added. “My family members definitely weren’t farmers. I guess you weren’t listening when I said ‘mansion’.”\n\nAs we rounded the corner at the end of the village, my father smugly nodded his head at something ahead of him.\n\n“Take a look,” He said.\n\nWe squeezed our heads between the two front seats, eager to see what lay at the end of the half-mile stretch of road. Even at that distance, the humongous house loomed impressively above its surroundings. Woodland sat behind it, and huge gates sat before it, roughly a quarter-mile down the road. It was a ridiculously long driveway.\n\n“What do you think?” My mum asked. “Speechless, are we?”\n\n“It looks like a haunted house,” Jacob said.\n\nI leaned towards him and whispered, “I bet there’s an operating table in the basement.”\n\nAs we trundled onto the gravel at the front of the house, which I had half-anticipated to be abandoned, we were greeted by a dozen smartly-dressed servants. I thought to myself that my great aunt was probably the only employer left in the barren village. I kept that hypothesis to myself, of course.\n\nOnce we had all bundled out of the Range Rover, my father opened the boot. A young man in a suit swiftly sprinted in front of him.\n\n“Let me get the bags for you, sir,” The man insisted. “Mrs Rhinestone is waiting for you in the lounge.”\n\nYes. That’s our family name. Believe me when I say that I’ve faced plenty of ridicule for having what my friends call a “bougie” name. Felicity Rhinestone.\n\nMy brother and my parents headed to the front door. My sister, who was multi-tasking by looking at her phone *and* her surroundings, strolled alongside me.\n\n“These members of staff look like hostages. Do you think she pays them?” Lisa asked, smirking.\n\nI laughed. “We’re in the boonies, now. Who knows? The slave trade might still exist out here.”\n\nWe snorted under our breaths. Some of the servants collected our bags from the Range Rover, but most of them hung back. They were standing proudly on the driveway, as if they were the guards of Buckingham Palace. One of them, in particular, caught my eye. She was a young, spectacularly-pretty woman who wore her dirty-blonde hair in a ponytail.\n\nActually, she was a girl. She must have been around my age. She beamed at me, and her posture seemed a little lackadaisical, compared to her regimented colleagues. From the moment I first saw her, it was clear that she didn’t belong. I hardly registered all of those things, however. I noticed something else.\n\nShe had two black pupils in her left iris.\n\nDesperately trying not to gawp, I politely smiled at the servant and hurried my sister into the house, following the rest of our family. The beautiful staff member tilted her head to one side, following us with her three pupils, and there was something wrong with the smile on her lips. It filled me with immense dread.\n\nI was sure to close the front door behind me, so as to distance myself from the woman’s eerie gaze. It had nothing to do with the double pupils in her eye and *everything* to do with her haunting expression.\n\n“What was wrong with-“ Lisa began.\n\n“- Stop,” I interrupted. “You can’t comment on things like that.”\n\nMy sister was already Googling ‘two pupils one eye’, so I peered over her shoulder. That was when we first learned of polycoria. Lisa thought it was “cool”, but I told her to keep that opinion to herself. The condition comes with difficulties, such as visual impairment, which I was sure to point out to my younger sister.\n\nWe took a moment to admire the mighty house in which we found ourselves. I wouldn’t exactly call myself an expert in architecture, but the lavish Rhinestone home must have dated back to the late nineteenth century, given the long-faded Victorian decor.\n\nThere were so many dusty, neglected paintings of our ancestors. The canvases hung on mahogany walls, which lined two staircases at either side of the entryway. It might not have been mahogany. It was something needlessly decadent.\n\nThe lounge was visible through a large doorway on the right-hand side of the expansive lobby area. Standing in the doorway, my father spotted my sister and me. He beckoned for us to come and greet our great aunt.\n\n“And here are your two grandnieces, Audrey,” My dad said.\n\nAs my sister and I entered the lounge, my great aunt Audrey swivelled her head around to face us over the back of her armchair. It was only a courtesy, I suppose, given her blindness. Her glazed eyes surveyed Lisa and me. When she used to visit us, I always believed that she was lying. I thought she could actually see.\n\n“I assume you have both grown, but I wouldn’t know,” Audrey said, lightly giggling.\n\nI knelt on the rug in front of the log fire with Jacob, and my mum ushered Lisa into the kitchen. They helped the servants to prepare dinner. My little brother seemed contented that, at long last, his phone signal had returned. There certainly wasn’t any WiFi in that ancient house, so I warned him not to burn through all of his mobile data, or brain cells, on terrible TikTok videos.\n\nWhen I mustered the energy to stand up, I saw Audrey whispering to my father. I couldn’t catch all of it, but she seemed to be berating him for coming to the house. He told her that her ninetieth birthday was a special occasion, but she persisted with the scolding. I pretended to inspect the photographs on the mantle above the fireplace, so as not to arouse suspicion.\n\n“I told you never to come back to this place,” She whispered.\n\nI heard that last line *very* clearly.\n\n“Aunt Audrey can tell you all about the people in those photos,” My dad said, speaking at normal volume again. “Do you recognise any of them, Felicity?”\n\nI scoffed. “No. You’ve never told us anything about your side of the family.”\n\n“Is that true, Lionel?” Audrey gasped. “Surely, you’ve told them about your mother?”\n\n“I told you about Maggie, Felicity,” My dad said.\n\n“You told me her name,” I replied.\n\n“Your father’s mother — my sister — was a remarkable woman,” Audrey said. “I think you two would’ve liked her. She would’ve *adored* you. What happened in ‘89 was… Well, your father and I were fortunate to survive.”\n\n“Audrey…” My dad began.\n\n“I think we should talk about it,” Audrey insisted. “There was a time that you thought I was the greatest aunt in the world, Lionel. You see, Felicity, I was the black sheep of the family. The Rhinestones were always such serious people, and I felt suffocated by them. Lionel’s mother was the same, but she was always better at playing by the rules than me. She married, settled down, had children, and did everything by the book.”\n\n*Children*. I knew my father had lost his parents in the mysterious incident of ‘89, but he had never mentioned any siblings. \n\n“Maggie was the only one who looked out for me, much as you look out for your brother and sister, Felicity,” Audrey continued. “When I told my family what I’d seen in the Orchard, Maggie was the only one who believed me.”\n\n“Dinner!” My mum interrupted, bursting into the room.\n\nMy father guided Audrey into the dining area, casting a disparaging look at my brother and me, as if to say that we should just let the topic drop.\n\nWe entered a grand room with an obnoxiously-long table. More mahogany. More paintings. More rot, cobwebs, and dingy lighting. And yet, despite all of that, Audrey’s ancestral home still had an air of sophistication and character. It was haunting, but it was also beautiful.\n\n“What is this?” Jacob asked.\n\nWe had been served plates of indistinguishable meat with sides of vegetables. It *almost* looked like a roast dinner, but I shared Jacob’s sentiment. I didn’t like the look of the meat.\n\n“Jacob!” My mum gasped. “I’m so sorry, Audrey.”\n\nAudrey simply laughed. “It’s fine, Grace! I get it. Looks strange, doesn’t it, Jacob? It’s our slightly-unique cut of haggis. You’re in Scotland, after all. Anyway, it’s hard to find meat in these parts. The land… isn’t what it used to be.”\n\nBreaking the uncomfortable stillness that followed Audrey’s sombre statement, servants emerged from the kitchen to collect our plates. My parents engaged in conversation with them, attempting to revitalise the atmosphere of the meal. I recognised one of the workers from our arrival. The woman with polycoria. However, something was different. Her iris had returned to normal. There was only one pupil in her left eye. But that wasn’t what really stood out to me. Her face was warmer. Kinder.\n\n“Are you finished?” She asked, reaching for my plate.\n\nGazing at her, dopily, I nodded. The woman smiled at me with two blue eyes, each containing only one pupil.\n\n“I’m Rosie,” She said. “You’re Felicity, right?”\n\nBowled over by the bubbly girl hovering to the side of my chair, I shook off the fear and confusion that she had previously instilled in me.\n\n“Yeah! Nice to meet you,” I awkwardly replied.\n\n“Sorry for not introducing myself earlier,” Rosie said. “You looked a little freaked out. I hope I wasn’t giving you a resting bitch face. I just had a bad headache. That’s all. It’s been a long first week. I hate this job.”\n\nAfter that brief one-way conversation, Rosie took my plate and left, as did the other servants. The rest of the evening slipped away from me. I couldn’t stop thinking about the woman whose iris had changed in the space of a few hours. I couldn’t stop thinking about the complete transformation in her overall aura. I don’t know how else to describe the feeling in the pit of my stomach. All I know is that it filled me with unease. *Rosie* filled me with unease. As lovely as she seemed, I felt deeply disconcerted around her.\n\n“Hey, Felicity,” Lisa whispered. “Come and look out of this window.”\n\nLater in the evening, when we were exploring the house, Lisa and I ended up watching Audrey’s orchard from a second-floor window. It must have been around 11pm. The overcast moon barely illuminated the acres of land behind the mansion, but we saw enough. *More* than enough.\n\nThe grass was moving. Some black, featureless substance was seeping from the earth. It was slithering in long, snake-like trails towards the house.\n\n“What is that?” Lisa whimpered.\n\nBefore I could respond, there was a creak at the other end of the upstairs hallway. We both turned to see what had created the sound. Nothing. With quaking knees, my sister and I walked towards the other end of the corridor, clutching each other’s whitened hands in terror.\n\nWhen we reached the other end, we turned our heads to the right and looked down the staircase that led to the entryway. No light. No sound. *Nobody*. Everyone, other than us, had gone to bed.\n\n“I think we’re jumping at shadows in the orchard and sounds in the house,” I whispered to my little sister, attempting to soothe her. “Time for bed.”\n\nLisa nodded, wiping a tear that had started to form at the bottom of her eye. With a gentle nod of my head, I motioned at the bedroom door to the side of us. My sister entered the room and closed the door behind her. I turned around, ready to follow suit and get some much needed rest.\n\nThat’s when I saw her.\n\nAt the opposite end of the hallway, standing before the window that overlooked the orchard, was a woman. In the unlit corridor, only dim moonlight revealed any of her features, but it was sufficient.\n\nRosie.\n\nEven in the darkness of that upstairs hallway, I could tell that it wasn’t the friendly Rosie I’d met in the dining room. It was the *other* Rosie that I’d seen when we first arrived at the house. Only half of her face was visible in the white glow of the moon. The left side.\n\nHer left iris, even at the other end of the corridor, noticeably contained two pupils.\n\n“Felicity…” Rosie whispered. “Such a pretty name. Such pretty… *eyes*.”\n\nRosie turned to face the window. She gazed upon the orchard. Petrified, I was fixating on the shadowy spectre with its back turned to me. And then, in a slow-yet-somehow-instantaneous act, the unnerving woman raised her hands. She seized the two curtains on either side of the window. As her silhouetted fingers tightened their grip on the black fabric, I silently screamed. I understood what she was doing.\n\nThe curtains drew closed, and we were standing in the darkness. She was at the window-end of the corridor, and I was at the staircase-end. I wanted to run, but I couldn’t see a thing. Moreover, I was paralysed by fear.\n\nSilence.\n\nThen, the most horrifically-loud wheezing. The pitter-pattering of delicate footsteps across the corridor. I didn’t need to see anything to know that the thing, which looked like Rosie but *wasn’t* her, had started to dart towards me in the blackness.\n\nThroat closing up, I stumbled against the wall and opened the first door on my left. The bathroom door. I frantically slammed it shut behind me, just as something heavy barged into it from the other side. I twisted the lock and stepped backwards.\n\nI expected more banging, but the corridor was silent. The door was silent. All I could hear was my own heartbeat in the icy canals of my ears. Foolishly, I tried to convince myself that Rosie had gone. I told myself it might be safe to open the door and go to my bedroom.\n\n“I can see you.”\n\nThe words were whispered from the other side of the door, and they sent a tidal wave of goosebumps coursing across my flesh. Rosie was looking through the keyhole. I knew that before I even dared to look. Trembling, I reached for the light string and shakily tugged it. A murky, orange glow was cast from the forgotten lightbulb above me. I cautiously knelt on the tiled floor of the bathroom and shuffled over to the door.\n\nAt first, looking through the keyhole, I couldn’t see anything. Blackness. But then a chilling breath danced towards me, and an eye suddenly appeared at the other end of the keyhole, revealed by the light from the bathroom bulb. Two black, cavernous irises stared back at me from the single eyeball. I gasped in horror. I finally had a clear view of the two pupils in Rosie’s left iris, and I was no longer sure that I was looking at *pupils*.\n\nThey were moving. Swirling around her eyeball like miniature eels. Black, living parasites.\n\n“Rosie,” I whispered. “Please…”\n\n“Rosie is gone,” She croaked. “We need more bodies.”\n\nThe second pupil, which was writhing at the outer edge of Rosie’s dazzlingly-blue iris, suddenly *divided*. Before I knew it, there were three pupils fighting for space in her left eye. The newborn third pupil slid to the bottom of the iris. The black pupil, which wasn’t really a pupil at all, exited into the sclera, which is the white part of the eyeball, and started to ooze onto Rosie’s lower eyelid.\n\nOnce it had fully departed her eye, the watery, black thing started to slither down the narrow tunnel of the keyhole. It was moving *towards* me. I backed away in slow motion, losing my grasp of reality and watching as the unidentifiable creature seeped through my end of the keyhole. It trickled down the wooden door, heading towards the bathroom tiles on the floor.\n\nI didn’t know what to do. In a blind panic, I leapt into the bathtub, keeping my eye on the dark substance that was worming its way over the tiles. Once it had reached the centre of the room, I inched towards the door, reaching for the handle. Leaning over the edge of the bathtub, I twisted the handle and flung the door open.\n\nShe was gone.\n\nNo such luck with the black parasite. Knowing that time wasn’t on my side, I hurdled over the side of the tub, steered clear of the evil creature on the floor, and rapidly closed the bathroom door behind me. I pulled my jumper over my head and wedged it between the bottom of the door and the floor. Standing in the lightless hallway, I crouched down and stared through the keyhole into the still-lit bathroom. I had to stop the black *thing* from escaping.\n\nI tore off a corner of my T-shirt and plunged it aggressively into the keyhole, ensuring that there was no gap through which the horrifying creature could free itself. I didn’t know whether my barricades would be enough. I just knew I didn’t want to get anywhere near that thing. I had terrible visions of the black worm leap-frogging onto my face, wriggling its way into my eyeball, and painfully taking over my mind.\n\nZigzagging from wall to wall in the darkness, I found my way to the bedroom and locked myself inside. I didn’t sleep, of course. I sat on the edge of my bed, keeping my phone connected to its charger and continuously lighting the keyhole to my door. Those eight hours were longer than you could possibly imagine.\n\nIn the morning, feeling unwelcome in Audrey’s home, my father begrudgingly herded us into the Range Rover.\n\n“I’ve no idea what’s wrong with her,” He said, as we drove away. “I thought we could spend a fun weekend together.”\n\n“You just wanted to give her a nice birthday,” My mum said, consoling him. “We tried.”\n\n“She used to be easygoing,” My dad said. “I guess time changes things.”\n\nIt was a quiet journey. I was fine with that, at first, but something soon clicked. *Jacob*. We had passed so many red cars, but he hadn’t uttered a word or even threatened me with a punch. I turned to face my little brother, and I immediately knew something was wrong.\n\nHe didn’t look directly at me, but I know Jacob saw me in his peripheral vision. A twisted smile started to emerge on his face. I had to stifle a scream. My worst suspicion was confirmed.\n\nAs if some aquatic creature were about to swim to the surface of his eye, I saw his pupil *ripple*.",

        "text": "I really didn't want to teach. However, at twenty-seven, my writing wasn't paying the bills and I needed steady income. So I went and got a job at my hometown’s middle school. I was going to be a seventh grade ELA teacher to be exact. Apparently (and this should’ve been a gigantic red flag), Bainbridge Middle needed all the teachers (AKA babysitters) they could get even if it meant hiring people as inexperienced as me. So in July, the school rushed me through a quick teacher training program, a crash course for us crew of ambitious para-pros and clueless college grads.\n\nOur sessions were held in Camilla, Georgia, about thirty minutes outside Bainbridge, and held at a defunct high school turned ‘learning center.’ With a cemetery as its nearest neighbor, this building was a real fucking eyesore. \n\nWithin those bricks walls lurked classrooms trapped somewhere between the 1950s and urban decay, the place so old it still used chalkboards. Considering I was a semi-professional horror writer, I was drawn to it. After all, the learning center resembled a school of the living dead even in broad daylight. \n\nDuring my lunch breaks, I explored as much as I could. Today was no different as I made my way down a long hallway, walking past derelict classrooms lining up down the hall like prison cells. I stole a glance behind me but saw where I was all alone in this empty valley.\n\nFurther and further I journeyed until I reached the last two doors on the left. I looked through the first door’s window, and to my surprise, saw a class occurring inside. Even with the lights off, a middle-aged female teacher kept lecturing in front of a few teens, the teacher a true professional complete with a politician's smile.\n\nI stood there and watched but never heard anything. Not a single word. And all the while, the teacher never saw me, hell, none of the students ever even turned around. Their collective focus was strictly on a blank blackboard.\n\nBaffled, I looked over at the other room and saw where its cracked-open door awaited me. An intrigued smile crossed my lips. I started to step toward it-\n\nWhen a loud footstep echoed from down the hall.\n\nI whirled around to see a tall, skinny girl standing at the end of the hallway. This far away, she was nothing more than a blip on my radar. All I could see was long blonde hair and a summer dress that had colorful flowers all over its white fabric. Despite sunlight shining through the cracked windows, I couldn't see much more. All I knew was the young woman stood there completely silent and still, her gaze right on me.\n\nDread crashed my urban exploration aspirations. I forced myself to stay cool. After all, the girl was probably from class, either from the teacher training or from the muted classroom I'd just seen in the other room. A few more seconds passed but still the girl just stood there. She never once made a move. But neither did I until I finally entered that final room.\n\nCountless storage conquered the scene. I mean this was boxes of pure shit, the whole room a museum of ancient education displaying CD-ROMs, mechanical timers, floppy disks, and long-outdated textbooks.\n\nGrowing more amused, I strolled up to the front of the room, the tall closets and shelves blocking out all sunlight from the few windows in here. I saw desks that were literally standing on their last leg. And like an altar, a podium loomed directly in front of a chalkboard.\n\nOn the board, several scribbled student names greeted me: Billy Laurie Anne, all of the names written in a lower corner, the names surrounded by a makeshift square. Right above the square was the type of empty threat I’d been bombarded by since grade school: Need To Be Better Or Else\n\nI stopped to smirk at the sight. Then I grabbed a piece of chalk. I had a morbid sense of humor so naturally, I couldn’t resist scribbling I WILL KILL AGAIN in big, cryptic letters on the middle of the board. Admittedly, this wasn't my first time fucking around in empty classrooms.\n\nI slammed the chalk on the blackboard's tray and backed away to admire my craft amidst the clouds of dust shooting out. My smile was going nowhere. After basking in the act for a few more moments, I got ready to leave.\n\nWhen a sudden collapse startled me. One quick bang.\n\nI whirled around and saw the piece of chalk now lying on the floor. It wasn't even rolling, it just laid there lifelessly. Silent and still. \"What the hell...\" I muttered. My eyes darted to the blackboard then horror dominated my demeanor.\n\nThere my name was written amongst what I knew were the names of the other ‘bad’ students: Patrick. I was the latest addition after god knows how long.\n\n[14](https://www.reddit.com/r/rhonnie14FanPage/)",

        "text": "To keep it simple, for the last roughly month and a half my dreams have been becoming far more realistic. This is getting to the point where recently have been literally unable to tell when I have dreamt something and when I’ve actually done it. I’m going to do my best to explain what’s been going on but I’m really just looking for some advice. The obvious thing would be to go to a doctor but only recently has it been getting bad enough to consider going. \n\nIt started with my dreams morphing from me fighting characters from video games or driving in Formula 1 to the most mundane things imaginable. I have dreamt I was doing homework I had already done, changing components on my PC, or just driving to work. At first I was even able to control the dreams. Meaning instead of continuing to drive to work for example, I would “spawn in” an F1 car for me to drive. Eventually though they just become way too realistic. It’s as simple as that, there’s not much to say beyond this. \n\nSo to address the massive elephant in the room, the reason I am posting this in r/nosleep is because I’ve already tried to post it in advice subreddits. I’ve tried r/tooafraidtoask and r/nostupidquestions but in both I was called a troll and a “just trying to write a story”. This is likely because if you look on my profile you’ll see I’ve written stories about trying to convince the reader it’s real. So yeah this style is sort of biting me in the butt but I figured even if people here treat it as a story at least you will give me advice on my situation.\n\nFor example, where I work there is a valve that you need to turn in between the men and women’s restroom. All it does is shut off the water for the night. It is the most mundane, easy thing in the world. It can be easy to forget but the way I forgot was through my dreams. I’ve started sleeping during my break and I woke up thinking I had already done it because I had dreamt it. So, the next day when my manager asked me if I forgot, I confidently said no. But, I really think it was me now based on how vivid the memory is while simultaneously knowing it wasn’t done. \n\nWriting it out now, this feels like something that I could tell at parties as a funny story. However, it has continued to happen in the middle of the day. I fell asleep watching Peaky Blinders on Netflix and at some point I began watching a documentary on a Formula 1 driver. Now, I really love Formula 1 so I have a lot of knowledge on the history of it. I began watching a doc on a driver called Jim Clark. I was really in to it and I was enjoying the documentary. Then at some point I sort of just realized I’m staring at a black screen. I then realized the tv is off. I get on Netflix to continue to watch the doc but it just doesn’t exist. I must have looked on Netflix, using every name imaginable to try and find that doc. It just doesn’t exist. I think I dreamt it and was sleeping.\n\nI know this isn’t scary or fictional. I know this doesn’t seem like a problem with these two examples; but it’s getting so realistic and so often that I’m being late to school, late to work, I’ll dream I’ve already ate and not eat breakfast, I’ll dream I told my mom something when I haven’t, it just goes on and on. I am sort of getting emotional writing this because it really feels like I can’t tell what is real anymore.\n\nHonestly it’s not a problem if I just doze off while watching tv. But when I am standing in my bathroom wondering if I already brushed my teeth or if it was a dream, it gets scary. I don’t want to question my reality when I’m driving to work and wondering if I’m about to wake up. \n\nPlease please please at least treat this like a story and respond how you would if it were real. If this isn’t well written I’m sorry.",

        "text": "What was going on? I was desolated and night was already arriving, and I seem to have lost all sense of time while driving. The gps showed me an intricate mess again and this time it completely gave up giving me estimated times. I tried to find a safe place to stop and evaluate my options but there was no shoulders in sight. I drove on at night with the concrete walls and empty commerces with no humans in sight and the occasional favelas going by me and I felt like I was literally on a maze.\n\nAt this point there seemed that all roads went inside the one I was driving if ever I saw any other road. The GPS was telling me to turn only after 64km this time and I don’t even know how this city could fit this much road. This clicked me to the fuel situation again but the gauge didn’t move an inch since I last saw it. How? I must’ve driven like 100km since my last check.\n\nI had signal, I was getting notifications and other than the maze ahead of me everything was pretty normal. I asked for help in my family groups but no one knew how to help me since we are from small cities. I was even mocked for not knowing how to drive in the big city. I tried looking for a point of interest in the surroundings to learn more about it online and found nothing. More and more I felt like I was - literally - driving myself crazy when, alas the red LR crossed me again. This time it came from the right and was a bit slower so I tried to peek inside but the closed tinted windows didn’t let me see anything inside. I paid closer attention and saw a sticker on the back. It was sort of a devilish head. My hairs  bristled with this finding. I had one of those “this isn’t good” feelings. When it finally was out of sight, i felt relieved.\n\nIn the mix of avenues and roads that cross the city I never saw a toll or a beggar. The very rare humans I saw was always too far. After several hours following the map, I took another set of close turns and, man, I swear to god, I did everything right before the gps rerouted once more. I am 100% sure.\n\nI downloaded another gps app and at this point I was so tired I simply tried to route myself home. There was no deal with the instructions. Yet another mess that was going to take me left and right of town. This was so absurd and senseless, I felt my energies leaving me. I started looking for help at this point and because there were no humans I tried to signal to cars looking for someone to help me. No one seemed to even register my existence. I honked and screamed and waved my arms out and no one cared. The ocasional ads seemed to mock my situation, acting as if everything was normal when it clearly wasn’t. \n\nI was considering crashing into someone to get some attention - which reminds me now that I’ve never seen a police car - when I started driving parallel to a Nissan March and paid attention to whoever was inside through the tint but the person inside was so immobile it almost felt like it was a mannequin. He/she never moved their head to look at me even as I was driving super close and making horn noises.\n\nThe day had arrived again and was already close to noon and other than my car with limitless fuel I was hungry. Again, I could never connect to the entrance of any street that went into a neighborhood or a fast food chain. I was looking for service signs and one of the many signs that pointed to São Paulo neighborhoods had a graffiti saying “Hell”. It scared me like it was a devil jumping from behind me. Because I honestly felt like I was in hell.\n\nHungry and tired night was coming back again and i stopped at a red light in one of the many unknown places I was driving through. It was close to one of those elevated bridges to cross large avenues and I saw someone crossing that bridge. This person was going the same direction as I was and yet from the moment it entered my sight it was looking straight at me. Even when it was very far, they twisted the neck in an inhuman way and still stared at me. I couldn’t make the facial features but could notice the eyes, staring.\n\nWhen the light went green I was so deeply scared and all I could think of was how to get help. I dialed the police and they answered. I explained I was lost and they asked me where I was. I tried telling them the name of the streets I was crossing but they said they didn’t know where I was. I didn’t know how else to share my position and spent what felt like an hour trying to get them to find me when for the I don’t even know which time now the red suv passed again.\n\nI dropped the phone and started following them. Even while feeling discomfort. I noticed a little opening on the rear left window so I tried to position myself in a way I could see inside. I assure you that behind that white leather seat I could see a pair of horns touching the car roofing.\n\nI freaked out and let the red car go before looking for somehwere I could stop. At this point, I didn’t care if it was somewhere safe.\n\nI ditched the car and started writing this experience to look for help while going as south as I can on foot. The problem is that I have walked for a long time and the gps still seem to show me more or less in the center of the city. A few seconds ago, the red Land Rover crossed just behind me. It never even seemed it wanted anything to do with me but I feel like it’s watching and torturing me. There’s a overpass ahead and I’m considering jumping off. I still have battery and signal, so if anyone can help me, please tell me how to go back to Parana from Rua Caipora da Aroeira in São Paulo, or where should I go. I see a park ahead and there is a closed metro station named “Agouro”.  I am very close to giving up. Please, help me…",

        "text": "My name is Thomas. I'm a paranoid schizophrenic. At least that's what ive been diagnosed with, on some level i wonder if I'm just more aware of whole reality that neurotypical people just can't sense... or other dimensions or something. My schizophrenia becomes stronger as i get older, and if i dont take my Clozapine for more than a day or two i can see some pretty weird shit. Im 28 now and cant live on my own because when it gets bad it gets really bad. it sucks because most of the time when people see me without medication they basically stop talking to me immediately. i swear i have a good heart i just cant help but react when i see things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis one time I forgot to take my clozapine for a day, the day basically went fine because the meds take a while to leave your system but when I went to bed, I woke up needing to go to the bathroom. I saw a really dirty looking young girl in my room leaning right over the side of my bed literally 2 feet above my face as I opened my eyes. she had yellow eyes and a bloody scab covered face. I screamed so loud that my roommate basically broke down my door trying to get into my room to see what was wrong with me. as soon as they got the door opened and flipped on the lights she was gone. like she definitely hadn't actually been there. But i saw her clear as day. I even felt blood or sweat or something like that land on my face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my roommate that it had just been a nightmare. In a way I wasn't lying... I was asleep and awoke to something so horrifying that I literally couldn't move a muscle out of fear. but i know what it's like to have this disease, and I was definitely fully awake. it's like I genuinely see stuff that cannot be real. most of the time it is absolutely terrifying shit like that night. I live my life in a balance of terror and medication. it's no way to live. I often contemplate suicide. I just can't bring myself to accept that its absolutely not real... like in my gut I am genuinely horrified of what I might see around the corner. I break down and have total panic attacks if I can't get my medication well before I even see anything strange, because of the memories of the past times I have gone without meds. Being my friend must be a nightmare. No wonder I have no friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was lucky I had a caring mother who did her best to make sure I never ran out of medication and who would literally drop everything and even leave work if it meant preventing me from going without my meds. My father was a little less sympathetic. I rarely talked to him even on holidays ever since he called me a lunatic when I told him about that night with the creepy girl. Fuck him. its been over a year since the last time i missed my meds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell... that is until my mom died in a car accident. I grew to rely on her so much. She was my only friend. the only person willing to try to understand me and what i see. even if she didn't believe what i was saying was true, she acted like she cared about how i felt regardless. she didn't put me down or try to constantly tell me what was real. she just loved me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout 2 weeks after her death i ran out of Clozapine again. i remember it was 7pm when i realized that i had not only forgotten my meds but that i had actually run out the day before. normally i would have called my mom as she kept a few extra pills for me for just this kind of situation. god damnit i missed her. but its really hard to miss her when the closet door keeps opening and closing on its own. i dont know if i was just seeing it or if it was really happening. i could hear the door whether or not i was even looking at it. i got up and walked over to the door and slammed it shut. my roommate just happened to be walking down the hallway when i did that and she yelled that i startled her. her yell totally scared the shit out of me and i screamed bloody murder. she opened my door and saw my sitting on the ground with my back to the closet door holding it closed for dear life totally out of breath, covered in sweat staring up at her. i must've looked a mess because i hadn't slept well for days thinking about my mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...it was the final straw. i totally freaked her out and she left. she packed her shit, and she left immediately. for me, It was an all time low. Just complete rock bottom. How could god let life be this difficult for me? What did I do to deserve this god damned life! I fucking hate this! I just wanna die. Nobody loves me. I dont love anybody either. Fuck everyone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... that was last night. I think? As I'm writing this i find myself in some strange place I don't recognize at all. or rather can't... I'm in total darkness. surrounded by it. I keep hearing that same snickering that was in my closet last night. it's cold... and the walls are made of concrete. it looks like there's a window that i might be able to climb out of on the top side of the wall here. its so scary i can hardly move my head to look around. I swear i just went to sleep after.. wait. I cant remember anything from after my roommate slammed the door behind her. i dont even know where i am right now. What is this place? how did i get here? I gotta get the hell out of here. Ill be right back, im gonna go for that window. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so I got out. I crawled out of what seems to have been an old air return at the floor level of a hallway in some old abandonded house. it was completely dark on the main level too. to the right was a pitch black doorway into some kind of room, some kind of breathy whispering beckoning me to come in, got some seriously sinister vibes from there. to hell with that. to my left seemed to have at least a tiny amount of light coming in from the outside. so i decided to head that way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs i walked into the room i realized it was the front living room of the house as there was a front door with a little half circle window at the top of it letting in some moonlight from outside.. although there was nothing but a single chair with my sister sitting in it in the left corner of the room. only problem is she died a long time ago from alcohol poisoning at 17 years old. she was always shitfaced drunk even during the daytime back then. she was such an abusive piece of shit to us growing up. i know she cant be real but she seems so real.. and still totally drunk too. she couldnt even keep her head up straight. like as if it was broken or something. i wasnt sure who she even was until she said something while staring at the wall, i couldnt even see her face but i absolutely recognized her voice. at first she was whispering, i couldnt hear it. i slowly crept towards her to hear what she was saying. the closer i got the louder she spoke. Run. She was practically yelling it by the time she turned and looked at me. she had those same yellow eyes. terror completely took over my body and thank god i could run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd i did. i ran to the door and opened it. looks like this is the only house here. there are literally no other houses anywhere that i can see and the road out front is like an abandonded highway or something. for whatever reason i decided left is the way. i got tired of running and now im walking. i see another house up ahead, maybe someones home. Im gonna run again. that damned cackling is still in my head. although it almost sounds like it was in the house? Im not sure. ill be back\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBad news. this isnt real. it cant be. everything seems so weird here. when i got to the house i knocked on the door and it just opened as if someone was waiting for my knock but as you might have guessed, with my head, there was nobody. I dont know if i opened it myself or if it actually just freakin opened on its own. i knocked i know i did. my predicament also got much much worse. I think at this point im just writing this becuase i am too terrified to look up from the screen of my phone. I went into the house after the door opened, scared as hell but without options anyways. it was so damn dark. No power. No switches. no light bulbs anywhere actually. on the right wall i could make out a staircase heading upstairs, and the wall directly in front of me had a doorway leading into a kitchen i think. i cant see. why cant i hear my own footsteps? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided i would go through the doorway directly in front of me. I guess because going upstairs means i have no way out but backwards. Plus i thought i heard someone in the kitchen. Wrong. I didnt hear someone at all. It was something. It was this sort of animal. like a dog but extremely obese. with legs just big enough to hold it off the ground. its face looked like it had three times as much skin as it needed to cover it. there was no nose. its eyes were yellow just like the girl from that one night. I froze in fear and just as fast as that happened it stopped moving or making any noise at all. Like it was listening. I stepped to the right behind a cabinet. i closed my eyes and held my breath. after what seemed like an eternety i breathed out slowly and opened my eyes. it was standing with its nose an inch from mine. i immediately recognized the face too. it was the girl that stood over my bed that one night. only she was huge and deformed. before i could even react she grabbed me and bear hugged me so hard i could feel my shoulders pop out of socket. i tried to break free but made literally not even the slightest difference. she totally completely had me and there wasnt anything thing i could do. Totally hopeless. as she grabbed me my feet got hot. like really hot. they were on fire. i looked down and could see a flame surrounding my feet and coming up my body. the creature stared into my eyes and laughed like a drunk spitting some sort of tar out of its mouth as it did. it screamed at me in some weird language ive never heard. It kept screaming and laughing until i guess i passed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow im here. im completely naked and Its dark. really dark. That damn cackling wont stop. I see flames but they aren't illuminating anything around them at all if that makes sense. I can see the flames as if theyre lit, but theres not light coming off of them. its really hot too. the floor burns my feet and hands and knees. i can hear people whispering but i cant see them. Im gonna try and talk to someone. be right back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay.. I got up and walked around and i brushed up against someone. they shushed me and then through touch brought my ear near their mouth. We never leave. we cant die. he just kept saying that while sobbing. im so scared. i can see something off in the distance. this room is massive i cant see any walls at all. its gotta be 300 feet away from me. looks like its searching for something. its huge like 9 or 10 feet tall. its kind of glowing. like it has some sort of light source that i can sense but i cant tell what its coming from. dear lord please save me. oh god i think it just looked at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...well its true. we cant die. that creature saw me from so far away and ran at me faster than ive ever seen an animal move. when it got to me it was so strong. it laughed as it ripped my arms off. it grabbed the skin that was torn and started pulling it off of my body. i was awake the whole time too. i felt every tendon tear.. every bone break. im so glad it crushed my head against the floor underneath its hoof as it seems to have made me pass out. I just woke up again. we never leave. we never die. \n\nOh my god.",

        "text": "This is not a story that “started innocently enough.” It started pretty fucking annoyingly, actually. You see, it wasn’t a zombie, bug, or werewolf that haunted me. It was *the beeping.*\n\nAs I made my coffee one Saturday morning, I opened a window. This action caused *the beeping* to come into my home. It was high-pitched, distant, and just intermittent enough to allow me to forget for a time. Then it would creep back in.\n\nI awoke to *“****BEEP!”***\n\nI drank coffee. **“*****BEEP!”***\n\nI ate breakfast. ***“BEEP!”*** \n\nI took a shower. ***“BEEP!”*** \n\nIt was incessant! I soon realized it must have been an alarm for a busted pipe, no doubt due to the recent freezing spells in the neighborhood. I was livid.\n\nDespite all this anger, I’m not a “go-getter,” as my father would say. I resigned to letting the beeping rule my world. After all, I could escape it as long as I left the house.\n\nThat was until it started to follow me. I was taking my twelfth bathroom break at work when I heard it. Surely I was mistaken. Surely I was going crazy. It couldn't be.\n\nBut then, so clearly: ***“BEEP!\"***\n\nNot a regular beep! A haunting beep. Soul-hounding beep. A beep you couldn’t forget, even in your sleep!\n\nI had to take matters into my own hands.\n\nIt was one of the years of COVID lockdown, and I hadn’t been anywhere since I moved to the city months ago. I wandered around my neighborhood aimlessly. The beeping was always out of reach, not guiding but constantly teasing. I walked until my feet were sore and my arms were numb from the cold. \n\nOne night, I went further than usual and lost my way in a thick fog. Every direction I turned seemed to be wrong until I finally collapsed. The only familiarity was the beeping, taunting me from the darkness.\n\nI rose from the cold ground and saw a golden glow. As I approached it, the beeping returned. It grew louder with every step.\n\nI stepped forward, and my big head slammed into a wooden door. A glistening golden cross shone on the front. It was a nunnery.\n\nA nunnery? Who stumbles upon a nunnery? Trust me. I thought the same. It did not stop me from rapping my knuckles on its beautifully dark, solid oaken frame. After a moment, it creaked open. A face shadowed by a nun’s veil answered the door.\n\n“What is it?” the face said.\n\n“Please help,” I begged.\n\nThe face, teeth glistening in the darkness, smiled and said: “Well, nuns surely don’t turn away those in need, do they?” She swung the door open with a loud creak. I hesitantly walked in from the cold and into the dingy abbey.\n\nFlickering candles lit the stone walls of the dank-smelling hallway.\n\n\"Sorry,\" she said. \"The power's out. I hope you don't mind.\"\n\nI followed her further in, and things got stranger. There was no light coming from anywhere besides the long, winding hallway. All doors and adjoining hallways were dark.\n\nMy head crooked up to see yet another darkened, cobwebbed stairwell. \n\nI said, “It seems other nuns don’t stay up too late, huh?” I shouted ahead. I looked down, and she had disappeared just beyond the bend in the hallway. I crept around the corner to find a heavy wooden door that stretched to the twelve-foot ceiling. I trepidatiously pushed it open with an ominous creak.\n\nCandlelight flickered through the smokey room. At the end of the long cathedral crouched the nun over an altar. I could see dark liquid dripping over it, staining the wooden floor.\n\n“What are you doing?” I asked to no response.\n\nI stepped closer. I had to see what intensely mesmerized her.\n\nShe slowly turned to me with a wriggling cauldron of putrid death in her arms. Maggots, worms, mites, severed appendages -- all mixed in a miasma of thick, crimson blood.\n\nI screamed until my soul threatened to set loose from my body, my soul torn from my bones, my face ripped from my --\n\n“Wait!!!” the specter yelled.\n\nI ceased my screaming.\n\n“I'm sorry,” She said. “Shucks, I always do this!”\n\nTo my surprise, the specter started crying. She turned from me, faced the stone wall and wept.\n\n“Why can’t I be *normal!*” she cried. “All the other ghosts have friends, but I always fuck it up!”\n\nI know it sounds crazy, but I needed to comfort her.\n\n“There, there…” I said. “It’ll be okay.”\n\n“No! No, it won’t! Sure, my brother Casper is the *friendly* ghost. And my sister, the Bell witch, is a family favorite. But who am I? NOBODY!”\n\nI know, I should have run. It’s a ghost, for chrissakes. One with family connections, no less!\n\nInstead, I said: “I get it.”\n\nShe turned, her pallid face streaming with ethereal tears.\n\n“My father says I won’t amount to anything too. He says I’m a failure compared to my siblings,” I said. “Somehow, he finds a way to make me feel bad when I’m around them.”\n\nI offered a handkerchief, and she dabbed the tears from her face.\n\n“I’m sorry about the food I offered you,” she said, gesturing to the cauldron of blood and guts. I thought this was the kind of food your kind ate! I just… don’t know what human beings want, I guess.”\n\nHer nebish, spectral hands wrung nervously in the darkness, and I thought it was charming.\n\nI said, “Neither do I. Maybe we can be friends after all?”\n\nIt was from then on that I visited the spirit in the nunnery every day. At first, I brought her food and gifts -- a can of sardines and bread or maybe a freshly killed dove. Things were happy for a while. I felt like I finally had a true friend.\n\nSoon she confided to me that if she didn’t make a kill soon, her father would disown her.\n\nIt almost killed me to hear her overwrought tale. I decided to oblige her. She lent me her gift of *the beeping* to lure fools into our web. They’d follow it, the pestering, incessant, ever-present beeping to our doorstep, then:\n\n*Wham!*\n\nI’d hit them, drag them through the hallway and present them to her for feeding.\n\nThey’d never see it coming. Honestly, the poor boys probably wanted relief from *it.*\n\nThe *maddening*, the *sickening*, the *hopeless*:\n\n*The beeping.*",

That's right, tonight, at around 3 A.M., we open the floor for suggestions for next picks for the next hour.\"**\n\nI pressed the button to queue the demonic laugh -- the same tired out track that I'm surprised, out of *all* the calls we got, none of them were about getting a new one.\n\n**\"But for now, lay back and relax in your infernal hot tubs as our first hellish pick for tonight is--\"**\n\nThe phone started ringing. I tried ignoring it.\n\n**\"... \"Hade's Triumph\" by Severance, followed by--\"**\n\nThe phone continued to ring. It's to a point where it was drowning out the sound of my voice. I raise my eyebrow, looking at the time. It was only 11:30 P.M., not even time for the nightly Q&amp;A segments and our \"Lucky Devil giveway\" was the night before. In short, there was no reason for some cock sucker to be calling right now.\n\nI waited about another half a minute for the damn thing to quit ringing, but it wouldn't. Finally, I roll my eyes and pick up the phone. \"Hello, my fiendish little Imp, we thank you for calling [REPER.FM](https://REPER.FM). Unfortunately, the floor is not open for--\"\n\n*\"Sing me a lullaby...\"* I paused. It sounded like a little girl on the phone.\n\n\"Well hello there, is your mother or father around?\"\n\n*\"Sing me a lullaby.\"* I clear my throat.\n\n\"Little lady, I appreciate you wanting to call me and all, but this isn't the right time to--\" I stopped and almost chucked the headphones out of the station window when I heard the shrill sound of wailing from the other end. Immediately, I smashed the \"End call\" button and began panting. I sat for almost a full minute, looking around the room before realizing the damn recording light was still on and picking up my headphones from up off the control panel.\n\n**\"Heh, forgive me for that, boys and ghouls, don't we all just hate** ***wrong numbers***\\*\\*?\"\\*\\*\n\nI hit the \"Terrified screaming\" track.\n\n**\"Yeah, I bet that IS pretty creepy, huh? All alone, dead of night, and suddenly the phone rings when you know it shouldn't from someone you don't know... But you know what's even creepier, Severence, with their hit song, \"Hades' triumph\"! Enjoy, you little devils you.\"**\n\nI hit \"Play\" on the song list and sat back. *What the fuck was that?* I thought as the opening riff of the song kicked in. In seconds, the room was filled with overly aggressive guitar riffs and heart stopping drumbeats, followed swiftly by the lead singer's almost trademark opening howl of rage, marking the beginning of the song. With that, my anxiety almost immediately melted away.\n\n***\"Howls from below, death in tow, and cries from the deep, rousing you of sleep...\"***\n\nBefore I even knew it, I was headbanging the shit out of the music like I used to back in high school.\n\n***\"When the wolves howl, the air so foul, and innocent wombs are plowed, you all know, to Hades you maggots bow!\"***\n\nI even mouth along to the chorus: \"Hades' Triumph!\" I was roused from concentration, however, when I heard the phone start ringing again. This time, it was somehow so loud that it actually not only stood out from the music, overpowering as it was, but even managed to *drown out* most of the music. Like the first time, trying to ignore it did me no good because it just kept ringing and ringing. Even when the song ended and the next one, one that was significantly louder and heavier by the way, came on, the phone was *still* ringing.\n\nRolling my eyes, I answered. \"Hello, my fiendish little Imp, we thank you for calling [REPER.FM](https://REPER.FM)...\"\n\nThis time, it was an older woman's voice, about mid-30s or so, softly saying, *\"Will you sing for me? You always used to sing for us. Remember that?\"* I paused.\n\n\"M-Ma'am, I'm not sure what you're--\"\n\nThe little girl's voice returned. *\"Sing for us. Sing us a lullaby...\"* They both then started repeating the words, \"Sing us a lullaby\". I mashed the \"End call\" button again before returning to the soundboard to prep for the Q&amp;A session. I closed my eyes and sighed.\n\n*Just get through the next half hour and then it's music again...* I looked to the clock. It was 12:45. *Fuckin' wonderful* I thought. *Only* five more hours till the AM DJ comes and I can go home and smoke myself stupid till 10:00 that night. I eyed the mini fridge. *No, better save the BANGs for later...*\n\n**\"Well, well, folks, it's that time again. That's right, for the next half hour, DJ 'Thulu is taking any and all questions, requests, and possible deals... For the price of your soul, of course...\"**\n\nI played the demonic laugh track and sat back. Now, typically these go one of two ways. Either the phone immediately starts ringing off the hook (sometimes before I can even finish my opening speech for it), or I get no calls at all that night. Tonight was the first time, however, that neither was the case. Instead, it was almost two minutes, and therefore I wasn't expecting it, before the phone startled me by ringing out of seemingly nowhere. I quickly threw on my headphones and hit the \"Answer\" button.\n\n**\"Welcome caller, our first of the night. What can** [**REPER.FM**](https://REPER.FM) **do for you toni--\"**\n\nThat sound from before, the sounds of wailing, blasted through my headphones, damn near giving me a heart arrythmia. *\"Why do you hate us!\"* the voices from before cried. My body still frozen, I heard the crying sounds build in tempo. Then, I could hear the woman's voice shriek followed by the little girl crying.\n\n**\"M-Ma'am, calm down, are you--\"**\n\n*\"I said shut up, bitch!\"* bellowed an almost inhumanly deep, growling voice that then began laughing.\n\n**\"Ma'am, hello, are you there? Is everything okay?\"**\n\nThere was no reply. The wailing sounds also ceased abruptly. I was left all alone, quiet and dark in the studio room. My breathing was unsteady, caught between hyperventilation and heavy breathing. Prone, alert, waiting for the next surprise.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nI looked at the time; 1:15 A.M. Only another 10 minutes before the music got to come back. At least then I'd have *some* kind of noise in the background.\n\nAbout 1:20 rolled around and I was about to announce that Q&amp;A was over and that \"The siren's cry\" by Taurus was up next when the phone rang again. Now, I almost didn't pick it up. Honestly, if I wasn't still trying to build up enough repertoire as a nighttime radio host for my portfolio -- I aspired to be a voice actor -- and therefore needed to keep this job at the station, I'd have been more than happy to let the bitch ring itself right on; crank caller, distress, or legitimate caller be damned. Of course, aside from what I just mentioned, that damn phone was just too goddamn annoying to listen to.\n\nI picked up the phone, bracing for... well, I can't really say *what* I was bracing for, but *something*.\n\n**\"H-ello?\"**\n\n*-- \"Hello?! Can you hear me?!\"*\n\nThe voice sounded panicked like the other two, but it wasn't either the woman or the little girl's voices this time. No, this time, it was a man's voice.\n\n*-- \"Hello, please, someone, ANYONE! Please help us! It hurts, It hurts so...\"*\n\nI began to hear a cloud of static devour his voice.\n\n**\"Sir, what's going on? Sir? Sir, are you okay?!\"**\n\nHis voice struggled in and out of static the way a drowning man fights for air.\n\n*-- \"I... It hurts... He hates us... Please... Help...\"*\n\nI was about to try and call out to him again when that deep bellow from before came back as a low, rumbling sort of demonic laughter that grew slowly into a beastial roar. *\"You get what you deserve, now shut up and--\"*\n\nI couldn't listen anymore because, right at that moment, all at once, each and every one of the screams came back. The last thing I could hear was, in a mix of both the demon's and the little girl's voice, was *\"Will you sing me a lullaby, please?\"* I sat there, staring bug-eyed and breathless at my discarded headphones. I reached out, shaking, to pick them up again when I noticed that they were glowing.\n\nI hesitated for a second before continuing to pick them up. They weren't hot at all, in fact, quite the opposite. They were so cold that my arm broke into goosebumps the instant I touched them. When I put them on again, the only thing I could hear was static, low and almost completely indistinct, sounding more like those rainfall ambiences you'd sometimes listen to to fall asleep.\n\nWell, that is until, a couple seconds later, when I realized they were getting closer, growing in intensity and pitch until I realized it wasn't static at all, but the screaming again. I started turning a few of the knobs to try switching the stations. Funny enough, *those* were red hot, blistering the shit out of my fingertips as soon as I touched them.\n\nEach and every fuckin' one of them were like this too, leaving only the broadcast and playback buttons being able to be touched. I pressed the broadcasting button and began asking if anyone was there and/or if they were okay and could hear me. Obviously, I got no answer other than the ever-growing noise. I noticed, too, that the room started to get extremely hot.\n\nScorching, in fact, to a point where I started feeling dizzy. Not only that, but even the chair I was sitting in started getting toasty on the backside, so I made to stand up, only to find that my pants had already somehow fused to the cushion of the seat. I was stuck, there was nothing I could do to escape or make any of this stop. I looked over to the window, intent on shouting, praying to God that I'd get lucky enough to catch some street bum's attention to come and get me the hell out of there, when I realized I couldn't even *see* the fuckin' street anymore. All that was there now was a blank void.\n\n*What the hell?! Where's the street? Where am I? How long has it been gone -- HOW could it be gone?!*\n\nMy head spun in *literally* every possible direction. I mashed the broadcast button again.\n\n**\"Hello? Someone, ANYONE? Can anybody hear me? Hello?!\"**\n\n*-- \"Hello Andrew...\"*\n\nMy eyes were two seconds from exploding in their sockets. I heard the deep, rumbling, roaring laughter blast me from both sides of my headphones, causing my heart to jump.\n\n*-- \"I'm sorry, ahem, I meant to say, hello \"DJ 'Thulhu\". Is that better?\"*\n\n**\"Wh-Who--\"**\n\n*-- \"Just your lucky caller for tonight. Aw Hell, I've been one of this station's biggest, and oldest, fans. I always love hearing your stuff, listening to the music and all. So do the filthy maggots and harlots here with me, as you've no doubt noticed.\"*\n\n**\"Huh? Dude, what the hell do you want from me?\"**\n\nI hear the laugh again.\n\n*-- \"Well now, that's an EXCELLENT question. Though I thought I was supposed to ask YOU the questions here, as the fan and all. Oh fuck it, I'll humor you, though the answer isn't about what I want from you, but instead what* ***Hell*** *actually wants from you.\"*\n\nI started throwing my head furiously around the room. I even peered around to the window again. Everywhere I looked, no one was there.\n\n**\"Where the hell even ARE YOU?!\"**\n\n*-- \"I'm everywhere. I'm inside each and every man, woman, and brat that was vomited up to this shithole Earth since its conception.\"*\n\n**\"Huh? Dude, that doesn't even make any sense, what the fuck are you--\"**\n\n*-- \"Whoa, whoa, slow down, motor mouth. As much as I love hearing your voice every night, I'm afraid you're starting to exhaust your good graces with me with all these interrogations of yours here. I mean, for fuck's sake, you haven't even given me a chance to answer your last question. You don't normally ask this many questions to people, do you?\"*\n\n**\"No, but then again,** ***this shit*** **doesn't usually happen either.\"**\n\nThe voice laughs again.\n\n*-- \"Eh, fair enough, I suppose, though I think from here on, I'd like to do most of the talking if that's all right with you, Mr. \"'Thulhu\", sir.\"*\n\n**\"O-Okay, whatever, just tell me what you want here.\"**\n\n*-- \"Ahh, that's better, though again, it's not just about me tonight, but about what all of Hell wants. Now, as I understand it, tonight is \"Devil's pickin's\" night, yes?\"*\n\n**\"Uh... Y-Yeah, what about it?\"**\n\n*-- \"Well, as your longest fans, I think it's high time we cash in on that opportunity, yeah?\"*\n\n**\"B-But I... I can't do that yet.\"**\n\n*-- \"What do you mean, you \"Can't\"? I thought that's how this was supposed to work, we pick the songs and YOU play them...\"*\n\nThe room was unbearably hot now. Sweltering. My breathing was heavy and my head felt light. The room began to spin and I thought I was going to collapse onto the panel in front of me.\n\n*-- \"What's wrong, \"DJ 'Thulhu\"? Cat got your tongue? The heat of the situation setting in, maybe?\"*\n\nI mashed the button again.\n\n**\"What the fuck're you doing to me?\"**\n\n*-- \"So much for letting ME do the talking, huh? Whatever, so here's the deal, pal...\"*\n\nI heard the laugh again, this time smaller, more of a chuckle than a bellowing cackle.\n\n*-- \"Myself, and the others with me I mentioned before are going to make a few song requests, and you're going to play them, got it? You know, just like every other \"Devil's pickin's\" night...\"*\n\nI started panting. My vision went cloudy, I could barely even distinguish the knobs from the panel in front of me.\n\n**\"F-F-Fine, okay, you win, but will you let me go if I do?\"**\n\n*-- \"Well, I am known for my deals, and a deal ain't worth a maggot's rancid turd if I don't hold up my end of them. I will let you go tonight if you play our lineup for tonight's \"pickin's\". sound fair?\"*\n\n**\"Y-Y-Yeessss.\"**\n\nDarkness was closing in. My body felt like it would've burst into flames at any second, just out of thin air. Suddenly, though, fresh air started to fill my flaccid lungs again. I coughed and sputtered.\n\n*-- \"Now, you ready for the first pick?\"*\n\n**\"Yeah, sure, whatever.\"**\n\n*-- \"Good, now for this first one, Imma let one of the underlings shoot their shots first.\"*\n\nI heard the screams return, with the man's voice returning, sobbing.\n\n*-- \"I... I wanna hear you play...\"*\n\n**\"What? I... I can't hear you.\"**\n\nI heard the man cry out in pain, with the deep voice roaring at him to \"Speak up and quit crying like a little maggot\".\n\n*-- \"Pl-Play... Play \"Hero\" by Skillet...\"*\n\nI was confused for a second. I could hear the groans of agony also pick up in pitch. Then I heard an ear-splitting screech followed by a sickening squelching sound, followed finally by a gurgling death rattle.\n\n**\"Wha- What the fuck was that?\"**\n\n*-- \"Look, disregard what he just said, you hear? That pious moron has ALWAYS been a pain in my tail -- BOTH of them. When you try and do something nice for some people, eh?\"*\n\n**\"Wha... Huh?\"**\n\n*-- \"Ah, anyway, So, I think I'll let her go first then?\"*\n\n**\"Wait, who are you--\"**\n\nThe little girl came back.\n\n*-- \"Will you sing us a lullaby now?\"*\n\n**\"Huh? What are you talking about?\"**\n\nThe demon voice was heard laughing.\n\n*-- \"Aw, she is just SO precious, ain't she? Well, you heard her, play her a lullaby.\"*\n\n**\"B-but how? I mean, I don't have any--\"**\n\n*-- \"Didn't your mother ever sing to you when you were her age?\"*\n\n**\"Um... Y-Yeah, I... I guess so, but--\"**\n\n*-- \"Well how fuckin' lucky for you. See, SHE never got to hear a lullaby, you wanna know why?\"*\n\nI was about to try and reply that I really didn't. Sadly, he wasn't *actually* asking.\n\n*-- \"She never got to hear a lullaby because her mommy kept trying to kill her every night. Yeah, real piece of work SHE was, huh? Oh, but don't worry, she's here too.\"*\n\nThe voice laughed and the little girl returned.\n\n*-- \"Please sing me a lullaby, Mr. DJ 'Thulhu?\"*\n\nI paused for a moment, unsure completely as to what the hell I was supposed to do. I don't know exactly *how* long I sat idle for, but it was apparently too long for whoever it was on the phone because the next thing I knew, the air in the room started getting thick and heavy again. This time, I could even see my skin turning a bright pinkish sort of red, like a sunburn.\n\n*-- \"Getting hot in there, ain't it?\"*\n\nThe voice laughed again. The little girl, I heard, started to break into tears.\n\n*-- \"Why won't you sing me a lullaby?\"*\n\nMy throat felt tight, slowly choking me out. I reached out to push the answer button, which in itself felt like more of a struggle than it ever should've.\n\n*-- \"Why do you hate me?!\"*\n\nThe screams all returned. My skin was about to start blistering and my vision was darkening again. Finally, I managed to hit the button and start (Sort of) singing.\n\n**\"Rock-a-by-baby in the treetop. When the wind blows, the cradle will rock. When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall... And down comes baby, cradle and all...\"**\n\nThe air pressure returned to normal and I could breathe again. For a moment after, nothing happened. The other side was dead silent. *Is that it, are they finally gone?*\n\n*-- \"Well, well, ain't that just awful touching?\"*\n\n**\"Alright, look, I sang your damn lullaby. Just pick the next song already.\"**\n\nThe voice let out a roaring laugh.\n\n*-- \"Geez, kid, I'm just trying to have a bit of fun here. Not like there's anybody else on the line waiting, ya know.\"*\n\nThe woman's voice was next.\n\n*-- \"Play \"The world falls apart\" by Devious Jackers.\"*\n\n**\"Um... O-Okay...\"**\n\nI started flipping through my records and CD's in the filing cabinet next to the panel.\n\n**\"I... I don't have it.\"**\n\n*-- \"Check your playlist again.\"*\n\n**\"What? My playlist?\"**\n\n*-- \"On your phone, go on, check it.\"*\n\nI did. Opening up my playlist, right at the top was the song. My eyes widened.\n\n**\"Wait, what the hell? I didn't buy--\"**\n\n*-- \"Oh, nevermind that now, just play it. And don't worry, it won't rack up any \"Suspicious charges\" on your bank account. Just play it and it'll be gone by sunrise.\"*\n\n*Sunrise* I thought. I looked at the time. It was now 4:00. Only another hour and a half till the sun starts coming up. Of course, I wasn't exactly sure how it all worked here, but my belief was that, who or whatever these jack-offs were, they'd be gone by sunrise and this would all be over.\n\n*Just another hour...*\n\nI pressed the button to play the song. The song itself was almost 10 minutes long, with strung-out guitar solos and long periods of time where the vocalist just howled gutturally into the microphone. Usually, you know, I'm all into that shit, but this time... I couldn't tell why, but I was actually unsettled. The tune itself felt like it was travelling inside of my body, battering all of my organs around, and then forcefully pulling out my spirit or something like that, I don't know -- I'm not religious.\n\nFinally, the song ended.\n\n*-- \"Bravo, DJ 'Thulhu. You really are the best host here, aren't ya?\"*\n\n**\"Whatever, just hurry up and pick the next song.\"**\n\n*-- \"You really ought to learn to relax, but as you wish. Now, I think I'm feeling generous enough to let this fucker have another turn. What do you say, ready to choose a song again?\"*\n\nThe man's voice returned again, though this time it was mutated, sounding like a mix of his original voice and that of the demon voice.\n\n*-- \"Yes, master, I want to hear \"From below\" by Leviathan.\"*\n\nLike last time, I started flipping through the CDs as well as checking my playlist on my phone. Right as I was about to tell them I didn't have it, though, there it was, appearing spontaneously at the top above \"The world falls apart\". Sighing, I hit play.\n\nThis song was even more rending than the last. This song not only carried on for 3 times as long, but also didn't even feel like an actual fucking song, but rather a weird ass sort of ambience. Imagine thise ambiences you'd hear of like an underwater setting or something, right, only instead of sounding like an aquarium or anything like that, all you hear is some gigantic *thing* growling like it's trying to say something (don't even bother asking me *what*) for 30 minutes straight. That's exactly what this \"song\" was.\n\nWeirder still, This one actually started having me seeing things. I imagined the world, drowned in a red river, blood I assumed, with everyone in it crying out for mercy like the voices on the other end of the radio were earlier. Then, from the river, I watched this tyrannical creature with four stupidly muscular arms, Jagged, almost metallic looking teeth, Marbled, pitch-black eyes, and a giant maw that looked like it'd swallow the planet whole.\n\nI had no idea what it was trying to say, but I could see its mouth move in accordance to the garbled \"lyrics\" from the music. Not only that, but the monster seemed to be looking straight at me as it spoke. The screams then started to emit from the body of the beast, with the people having actually fused with the damn thing to form this chimerical abomination straight out of a goddamn horror movie. That was when they all screamed out to me, \"We are, all of us, together...\" The monster's body began to change, it's slippery, scaly flesh dissolving away into that of a giant shadow that loomed over the world. \"The End!\"\n\nI remember screaming at this. Funny thing was, I wasn't even trying to scream. Yeah, I was scared, yeah, my mind was *beyond* fucked to the point of no real return, but despite this, I wasn't making a conscious effort to scream, even if just out of a reflex, you know? I guess I should say that I was somehow actually *forced* to scream. In any case, though, I came out of it some time later and found that the song was over. I looked at the time.\n\n4:45 A.M.\n\n*Only another 15 minutes...*\n\nI honestly wondered if I'd even last that long.\n\n*-- \"Well, well, certainly a banger that one was, huh?\"*\n\nI didn't respond for a good two to three minutes, still not convinced everything was back to normal again -- well, at least in the *semi*\\-general sense.\n\n*-- \"Hello? You still with us here, DJ 'Thulhu?\"*\n\nI hit the button.\n\n**\"Y-Yeah. Yeah, I'm here, look, \"Devil's pickin's\" is almost over okay? If you've got anymore tracks to play, then let's get 'em over with.\"**\n\n*-- \"Well Christ on a stick, you ain't kidding. It really is almost up, ain't it? Well then, Its a good thing I saved the best for last.\"*\n\nThe screams, the roaring laughter, and the sounds from the last track, all combined into one as I heard the voice say for me to play something called \"The Deal\" by The Fallen. My heart froze for a second as I shakily opened the playlist to find, like the other two, that it, too, poofed its way to the top of the list. Fearing a lot more what would happen if I hesitated, I panic-mashed the play button.\n\nImmediately, the speakers emitted the absolute single most high-pitched screech that was even earthly possible. It even caused sparks to fly from both the speakers and the panel. In seconds, the studio was filled with sparks flying like fireworks. I reached to hit the stop button when the phone itself exploded into flames.\n\nFrom there, the room then caught flame, engufing the entire room in the span of only a minute. I frantically jumped up from my seat, now being free to move again, and tried jerking the door open. It was stuck, and so then I tried breaking the window. Somehow, though, even hurling the chair at it with all my strength was absolutely worthless. Over the chaos, through the headphones, I could hear the abominable voice laughing.\n\n*-- \"How's this for a hot single, huh?\"*\n\n\"What are you doing?! Let me out! LET ME OUT!\" The voice laughed again.\n\n*-- \"Well now, the song ain't over yet, now is it?\"*\n\n\"You can't do this, you have to let me go!\"\n\n*-- \"Not till the song's over. That was our deal, remember? You play my little selection, and I'll let you go. Don't worry, this IS the last one, I promise. Now, I'm gonna enjoy the rest of this song and you... well, you can go back to trying to beat the heat...\"*\n\nI heard the laughing one last time before I heard the line on their end disconnect. I looked around the room. Everything, everywhere was swallowed in flames. I was trapped. There was nowhere I could go, nothing I could do. The flames crept teasingly slowly ever closer toward me. Smoke now infested the air, suffocating me further. In seconds, I was gagging and wheezing. My vision clouded over, my arms and legs lost strength, and darkness spread across the room and then...\n\nAnd then nothing...\n\nI couldn't see, feel, smell, or hear anything. It stayed like this for God only knew how long and I'd have thought for sure that I was dead if it weren't for the fact that I was shaken awake by a firefighter. My vision was blurry and my head felt like a sack of bricks had been taken upside it at full force. \"Wha- Where...\"\n\n\"Easy there, son.\" said the fireman. \"Just breathe.\" I tried to and it resulted in a whooping cough. He then gently fitted an oxygen mask to my face. \"Here, now try.\"\n\nIt was still a bit before I was able to, but I was able to start eventually breathing properly again. When the police arrived, along with my boss, the producer of the station, I was almost instantly barraged with questions along the lines of \"What in the unholy hell happened in the studio?\" I'd have laughed at that, if only out of sheer morbid irony, but of course the condition of my lungs wouldn't have allowed for that. And obviously no, I didn't try explaining what any of *that* was that happened. Instead, I just told them that the equipment caught fire and the door and window somehow got stuck.\n\nBeing honest, if it weren't for the email I got just a few hours later when I got home, I'd have probably believed that. As it was, I found out that my survival is thanks to a random tip from a \"Deep voiced fellow\" as one cheeky nurse out it, that they'd seen the studio building on fire. I was rushed then to the hospital, where it was found, albeit rather quickly, that I was relatively unharmed, outside of a bit of smoke inhalation, and was sent home.\n\nIt was there, though, that I got an email on my computer from an email that, as far as I was aware, couldn't be real, that read as the following:\n\n*\"Glad to know you got outta there, DJ 'Thulhu ;) Can't have my favorite host getting all crispy on me just yet. After all, next \"Devil's pickin's\" night is next Friday, right? Well, gotta keep the maggots entertained till then. See you soon, Andy!*\n\n*Sincerely,*\n\n*Your lucky devil ;)*\n\n*(P.S. Don't worry about the studio, I'll personally see to it that it's up and running again...)\"*",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/107w97w/my_hinge_date_thinks_my_house_is_haunted_and_she/)\n\n*How did I get this ghost? What was it?* The questions spilled out of me to Penny.\n\n“Everyone tries to complicate ghosts, like there’s always some backstory or they latch onto you because it’s someone you knew or something. The truth is it’s just a glitch in the afterlife system. Some get lost and hang around. They try to cling to any life they can find and hang on so if you get stuck with one that’s it,” Penny explained. \n\n*I needed more. Why me?*\n\n“It’s totally indiscriminate. It’s like a virus. Like your water heater guy could have left in here, the pizza guy could have brought it. Usually, if you’re mentally healthy enough you don’t notice them and they wilt and go away. They live on attention. Clearly you’re not clear of mind. That’s why I told you to stay home, we don’t need you out there running around, spreading it around,” Penny answered. \n\n*But it looked and acted like people in my life? My exes. My mom.* \n\n“They evolved that to show up as people you know and love so you would keep them around. If you’re healthy enough, it doesn’t present that way, and the only way to beat it is to get better, which you seem to struggle with doing. It talks to you. It interacts with you. It drives you crazy. What do you think happened to all those homeless people out of the street screaming at nothing?”\n\n*So the house isn’t haunted? It’s only people that matter?*\n\n“No, that whole ‘it’s the person that’s haunted, not the house’ is just an excuse made up by writers to keep the family in the house in movies and books and stuff.”\n\n*How do I get better?*\n\n“Just you gotta let the thing in and be stronger than it. Don’t give in. You never should have fucked that wild ex when she showed up. You knew she was bad news and probably could have given you and S.T.D., or got pregnant. You knew the ex you liked wasn’t real. Deep down. You knew she wouldn’t just show up unannounced and want you again, but you let it in.”\n\n*So what do we do?*\n\n“WE don’t do it. You do it. I’m leaving and you just have to fight through it and not let this thing take you down. It will eventually fade.”\n\n*Okay, all good, it can’t kill me?*\n\nPenny hesitated. I didn’t like that. \n\n*Right? There’s no documented cases of a ghost hurting or killing…*\n\n“You think ghosts leave fingerprints? D.N.A? You hear of someone dropping dead randomly of a heart attack while otherwise healthy? Fall in the shower? Someone who doesn’t seem depressed committing suicide? They mess you up in to doing it.”\n\nThis information didn’t set well. Neither did Penny leaving, despite her encouragement that I could get through it, along with a reminder that I couldn’t leave the house or interact with anyone. \n\n*Wait.*  I ran out and caught Penny before she drove away. Clearly bothering her, but I had to ask her the question. \n\n*“Don’t you have it now? The ghost?*\n\n“Kind of like a virus. Once you get through one, you’re immune,” Penny said and drove off. \n\n\\-\n\nI was on my own. I turned on every light in the house. Turned on a bunch of electronics, just like Penny said. I wanted to draw this thing in this time. \n\nI sat there, numbly watching T.V. and waiting, trying to remember the things that Penny told me. \n\nI had to just let it come and ignore it. Not give in. I couldn’t leave home. It would get fainter and fainter and I had to just keep pushing through. Don’t reach out to her, that would show weakness. Just ride it out. Try to sleep. \n\nThat’s what I did. I went to bed. \n\nThen it started. \n\nI was lying in bed and I felt the heat start to crank. I started sweating profusely underneath the blanket I had pulled up over my head.\n\nI could feel it there next to me. Next to the bed. \n\nThen I felt it start to pull on the blanket. It was strong. I was not going to be able to fight it off. \n\nI soon found out. I was soon looking at my younger brother, James, who passed away when he was in his early-20s. \n\nAlways stronger. Always more confident. James was a force of nature with no fear. Which is why he passed away - thinking he could drink entire bottles of liquor and drive, and not get caught, or drive off a highway and crash his truck. \n\nThis was the kind of thing James would do growing up. Go into my room and pummel me. Pin me. Wrestle me. Assert his dominance.\n\nHe started to climb on top of my chest and I turned away. I laid on my side and just let him keep trying to wrestle me and grab my attention. \n\nThis virus of a ghost was diabolical. It knew James would rupture my heart. Even worse than my mom. \n\nI never got to say goodbye to James. He was just gone one Sunday morning when I woke up. My older brother. The one who stood up to anyone who picked on me. Reduced to ashes off of Highway 9.\n\nHe kept chiding me in my ear to try and get me to fight back the way he always would. He took everything in me not to turn around. \n\nThen I felt him twist my ear. I felt real searing pain. He cranked it hard a way he never would in real life, reminding me it wasn’t really James there torturing me in my bed. \n\n*Penny had said like a real virus, it was going to get worse before it got better and I could see the light.* \n\nI finally got out of bed and ran to the bathroom. I could finally breathe for a moment and collect myself. \n\nThen the lights started to flicker off and on. An annoyance James would love to terrorize me with when we were kids. \n\nIt took a second but James started to come back into picture in the bathroom mirror - drenched in blood, his neck ripped open. The sight of it got me to start crying uncontrollably. I could barely see my tears were so thick. \n\nJames started to plead to me - begging me - sounding soft and pathetic and hysterical and scared in a way I never imagined my big, bad, older, brother could. \n\n“Please, please, please, you gotta help me.”\n\nThere was nothing I could even do by the looks of it either - he was bleeding out, and fast. His blood was splashing all over me. \n\nHe leaned all his weight on me and I stopped fighting. I let him take me down to the floor. \n\nThen he flicked out the lights and I felt myself start to feel like I was suffocating.\n\n\\-\n\nI woke up in the bathtub - half-full with water and the shower pounding water down on my face - cold and shocking. Penny stood next to the tub, looking pained, but relieved that she saw life on my face. \n\nIt took me a second to realize something else odd - the lighting was dim and murky. It was candlelight. \n\n“It got you to turn the power out and I can’t figure out how to get it back on,” Penny explained. \n\nI couldn’t think of how I would have even done that, especially considering I had just woken up from a black out. \n\n“It had you deep. You were almost gone,” Penny went on. \n\n“What happened?” I asked Penny. \n\n“I realized I had to come help you. I also realized it’s my fault. I relapsed,” Penny said. \n\nI had no idea what that all fucking meant. Apparently, with Penny’s explanation, it meant this:\n\nShe went home and was greeted by the awful violent spirit of her abusive dad. His presence gave her a revelation - she wasn’t getting creeped out by the spirits in my house that first night she stayed over, she was creeped out because my house really reminded her of her horrible childhood home, where her dad terrorized her.\n\nThe vulnerability my house kicked up in her had left her open to getting invaded by the virus of new spirits - bad ones. And she had left that energy at my house that first night, and it festered and grew with the darkness and vulnerability inside me. \n\nBut she would make it right. It was all her fault, and she was falling apart. \n\nI heard the grotesque sound of a gristly throat clearing outside the bathroom door. I saw Penny’s face drop in a way that made me very, very uneasy. \n\nSomeone tried the door handle. It rattled. Locked. I heard an angry man scream at the door. \n\n“Open the fucking door, right now.”\n\n“Can’t it just get right through the door anyway? It’s a spirit. Mine did it.” I asked Penny. \n\n“It’s what this one wants to do. It wants to get angrier,” Penny whispered back. \n\nPenny killed the candlelight. Pure, unfiltered darkness reigned again. \n\nThe angry man kept yelling belligerently and trying the door. He pounded on it, nearly breaking the thick wood. \n\nI had been through a lot. My body felt ravaged. I had no idea if I was going to be able to sustain whatever pissed off evil was going to come through that door very soon. \n\nI knew one thing though - I was going to fight for Penny. I wasn’t going to let this poor woman suffer any more. Even if she was supposed to be my sherpa and how she was the one crying scared. \n\nI felt Penny run away from me. She was out the bathroom door because I could stop her. \n\nI could hear a struggle out there. \n\nI went out into the living room. No one was there. \n\nThe front door was wide open. \n\nI watched Penny’s shitty car drive off down the street. \n\n\\-\n\nPenny wouldn't reply to my texts, calls, or social media requests. I wasn’t sure if she was alive or dead. \n\nI never felt or saw odd things in my house anymore though. I felt truly alone again for the first time in a long time. In a good and a bad way. \n\nThe solitude allowed me to reflect on everything with Penny and what she said - the way the ghosts appeared and presented themselves. How there were good and bad spirits. \n\nI wondered if Penny was just one of them all along. A good one. \n\nI let it go and happily went on with my life, just more thankful. \n\nI dated again. I got a girlfriend. \n\nSaid girlfriend and I went to a farmers market one day. I drifted away as she got lost in some jewelry stand or something I wasn’t interested in. \n\nI wandered by a candle booth. The curly hair of the woman manning it caught my eye. It was Penny. Undoubtedly. \n\nMy eyes lingered on her as I walked past. \n\nShe never noticed me. That was fine with me. \n\nI kept walking. ",

Last night, I ended up not taking my dog’s initiative and simply went to work. About an hour later, I was home, and Scout had been asleep, or at least, I assumed. She trotted from my room to greet me when I came in. I had left the living room light on, as I always did when I left for work late at night since I didn’t want to come home to darkness, but this time…I don’t know. The book commanding me—or to whomever it was directed—to keep some sort of light on stuck with me. Scout seemed fine. She was wagging her tail, and when I looked over to my roommate’s bedroom, the door was closed, and her light was on. She must’ve come home while I was at work.\n\nA part of me was relieved.\n\nI swapped my clothes for pajamas and got ready for bed. On my bedside table, I have this squishy unicorn light that changes colors. I turned it on before shutting the living room light off.\n\nEven on my way back to my bedroom, I felt that eerie sensation of being watched… I kept the unicorn light on all night.\n\nThirty minutes after I shut my door and tucked myself into bed, I heard creaking of the floorboards, like someone was walking around. I tried to convince myself it was my roommate. She’s a night owl. But even that was no use. No lights turned on. My roommate wouldn’t walk around the house in the dark…\n\nI wished that thought hadn’t crossed my mind. It made me nauseous.\n\nI clenched my eyes shut, repeated “It’s nothing” like a mantra, and almost fell asleep until another creak, right outside my room, was too loud to ignore.\n\nScout started to growl and moved from under the comforter. Her eyes locked on the door, and I fought the urge to follow her gaze. I barely got any sleep. Every sound woke me up, and Scout was on high alert. At one point, she turned her attention to the window, and I had to just cover my head with the blanket to pretend she wasn’t doing what she was doing.\n\nThe immense weight off my shoulders when the sun finally rose was immeasurable; however, my body was strangely fatigued. It wasn’t terrible, but my limbs were sore, heavy, as if I had gone to the gym for hours the day before. I was light-headed, almost dizzy… I’ve missed many nights of sleep in my college days and from being immersed in video games, but I had never been this tired. My mental capacity from whatever was going on must’ve been at an all-time low. Thankfully, I had the day off from my full-time job and only had a few pet sits later in the afternoon. I tried to keep my mind off yesterday and spelled out the chores I wanted to get done.\n\nThis happened about forty minutes ago.\n\nI decided to do laundry. The machines are in the basement. No big deal. There are plenty of lights, including one that hangs above the machines. \n\nI put in a load and made my way back upstairs. I flipped the light switch off, but as I turned around to shut the door, I glimpsed the foot of the staircase. There was a silhouette standing there.\n\nI didn’t allow myself any time to take it in. A gasp caught in my throat, and I turned the light on faster than I registered what I was even seeing. When the light shone, the figure was gone, like it was never there.\n\nA featureless human figure doused in black. A shadow distinct enough against the darkness to drown me in a cold stillness. I left the light on after that.\n\nI sat on my couch, collecting my thoughts, still plagued with that intense exhaustion from a no-good night’s rest. That stupid book was in front of me, opened to page six—exactly where I had left it—but I was stupid enough to keep reading. Why, I can’t tell you. Morbid curiosity? The will to make myself believe it’s just a book and nothing more? \n\nWell, I don’t know whether this is a sick joke, an actual horror story someone wrote to mimic a child’s tale, or what…\n\n*When it has caught you, praying won’t help.*\n\n*You’ll never see the light of day again.*\n\nI had so many questions.\n\nWhat’s the “it” the book refers to? Why does it seem like it’s speaking to me? I’ve never read a story like this, but each page is formatted the same as the last. There’s fifteen pages altogether.\n\n*There’s nothing you can do to get away.*\n\n*There’s nowhere to go that it won’t follow.*\n\n__\n\n*The shadow will remain in yours.*\n\n*The closer it creeps, the weaker you’ll become.*\n\nScout barked then.\n\nI looked over at her, and she was just staring at the basement door, peering through the gap between it and the floor.\n\nI left the light on. I did. I swear to whatever higher being there might be that I left that damn light on.\n\nIf I was so sure of myself, why was it so hard for me to move from my seat? Why did I feel anchored to the couch, willing my dog to *just stop!*\n\nBut she didn’t. She growled and sniffed and whined. She even glanced at me as if urging me to check.\n\nI stood and warily walked over. Scout’s head was on a swivel, going back and forth between me and the basement.\n\nI left the light on. I did. I had nothing to worry about. Why was I so scared? There couldn’t be anything down there. It was just a basement. I was down there not long ago doing laundry, like any other day.\n\nI turned the knob, a terrible, paralyzing shiver coursing through me, and opened the door.\n\nThe moment there was enough space to fit through, Scout darted through the threshold and down the steps.\n\nIf there’s one thing anyone should know about me, besides my extreme love for zombie fiction, it’s that I’d do anything for my dog, regardless of the circumstance.\n\nI chased after her without so much as a second thought, despite fear nipping at my skin, though it was subdued once I realized I did, in fact, leave the light on.\n\nI was in the main space that doubled as the garage.\n\nNow, the light isn’t the brightest by any means, but it gets the job done, or so I thought anyway. Before any of this started.\n\nI called for Scout, made kissing noises. All I could hear was the washing machine’s spin cycle. After another attempt at recalling my dog, she came running from the back room, tail tucked, ears flat. She ran right past me, up the stairs with no acknowledgement of me whatsoever.\n\nThe back room wasn’t used for anything. It was full of cobwebs, dust, and old kitchen appliances my landlord discarded there for “safe keeping.” It was also the only room in the basement whose light didn’t work.\n\nI couldn’t see anything beyond the doorless entrance, but I felt like a child terrified of the monsters in the dark, monsters our parents insisted weren’t real—the ones in the closet, under our bed, in the corner of the room the glow from the night light couldn’t reach…\n\nA few moments later, I let out a breath. Nothing was there. Monsters aren’t real.\n\nI pivoted to make my way back to the staircase, only for three soft knocks to stop me in my tracks.\n\nI looked over my shoulder, waited, bit my lip…\n\nThere were three more knocks, undeniably coming from the back room.\n\nI didn’t wait a second longer. I ran upstairs faster than the warmth drained from my cheeks and slammed the door.\n\nI’m currently sitting against that door, knees up to my chest, typing on my phone. Scout’s on the couch, hiding under a throw blanket. The knocking won’t stop. Sets of three with a pause between each, just like yesterday.\n\nMonsters aren’t real. That stupid book is just getting to me. Like a horror movie that leaves you too afraid to go to the bathroom because the entire house is dark, the jump scares got you every time, and you’re convinced there’s a killer behind your shower curtain.\n\nMonsters aren’t real. They aren’t.\n\nRight?",

        "text": "29th of December 2022\n\nMy life hasn’t been short of interesting. I’ve experienced things that people desire to see, they spend their lives searching just to catch glimpses. But when you live within this lifestyle, these become common and you learn they aren’t something to be in awe of, they are things to fear. People don’t understand what they’re dealing with, they’re too naive to comprehend. I’m not a dark person but it gets dire seeing the same mistake made by the same types of people. Maybe writing about things here will help some other people avoid blatant mistakes like their counterparts. But before anything I’ll give you some backstory to how I’m in the position that I’m in.\n\nRural life isn’t as serene as people might hope. The escape to the country was always posted as some sort of American dream, but there’s something very unknown about the country. Miles and miles of forest, more woodland than settlements. Lakes so immense you’d think you were at the coast. It doesn’t feel like our own. It feels alienating. And maybe, our instincts, the only thing that has led us here today, aren’t too far away with that feeling. Nature isn’t where we are to meant to be met with comfort. That’s why humans have done whatever we can to stray away from it. Villages wasn’t enough, towns wasn’t enough- CITIES wasn’t enough, we know we aren’t welcome in nature. We try to flush it out. Trees into apartments, fields into basketball courts, we make whatever we can to feel like the primary residents in our small world but we won’t ever achieve it. Every building casts a shadow, and earth lay beneath our tarmac, you can flush out nature but not it’s residents. That’s not our job to do but we still persist on it. \n\nOur internal fear, left festering for generations gravitate the beings toward us, they have been here much longer than we have and we have no right to flush them out. Our belief makes them more prominent after every single human birth. I refuse to add to that prominence. I used to fear the unknown more than anyone else, but after you live around them, you see what they do to people, its harder to live in fear. I don’t want to say I’m devoid of emotion, but after years of this I think it’s understandable to become slightly more accustomed. Maybe living in constant fear has altered how I behave  and now it’s my natural state. I try to fight off that possibility but I can’t shake off the fact that it’s the truth. After all of this I’ve done what I can be make sense of the mystery that lies next to our civilisation. Educating myself on whatever it is we feed into, folklore, mythology and anything else which our minds have continued to create since our evolution. There’s more to this than just predators and prey, but I’m not sure if I’ll ever understand.\n\nNow just to clarify this doesn’t mean you’re going to come face to face with demons on an evening walk. There’s a lot to consider on how you’ll come into contact with these things, mainly based on where you live and your families history. If your oblivious to them it lowers the chance even more, they thrive off of belief, if you don’t pay any mind to them it’s harder for them poke a hole into your reality. And there may have even been times where you’ve come into contact with them and not known, they aren’t all ravenous, and some have appearances indifferent to us. There are a plethora of reasons as to why you might have never seen any of these creatures, but always remember even if you have all of these things in your favour the chances are never 0%. \n\nWhen it comes to understanding the supernatural one of the first shocks, is that some these classic little gimmicks which you’d expect to hold no significance, does indeed hold value. Numbers like 3, 7 or 13, different charms or repellents and types of foreshadowing all hold weight when we deal with supernatural entities. If anything it’s essential, these are the few things which help shift the balance between us and them. Without any of this, our lives would be very different. \n\nSecondly, these entities aren’t always as they’re portrayed in the stories. The phoenix is told to be an elegant creature, striking golden feathers through the sky. It’s said to live for 500 years and is reborn from its own ashes. A symbol of the sun holding virtues of benevolence, wisdom, sincerity, propriety and righteousness. The Phoenix is real and I have seen it myself, but I can promise it is nothing of the stories. When it passes overhead you can feel a cold gust against your neck in a room with no draft. Colours drown from all around you and it feels as if surrounding life has wilted into recession. No matter how high it flys you hear the shrieks, I’m not sure if it’s in constant pain, i feel as if it’s on the brink of decomposition but refuses to cross the line. Black tattered feathers malt off behind it like contrails from a plane, it’s scavenging for anything to keep it going no different than a vulture. The Phoenix is nothing to fear, and is nothing to bow to, a saddening creature of the underworld. Maybe once upon a time its feathers were gold and prosperous, it bestowed awe and benevolence to anyone lucky enough to see it. Id like to think it hasn’t always been how it is now, and one day I’ll see the Phoenix in its true form. \n\nHowever in these last few months more things have been happening around me, faster than I can adjust to them. People go missing all the time, but never my friends, I talk to them, they’re smarter than everyone else. So why can’t I contact, ANY of them. Nothing I’ve seen works to take down a network of people, it doesn’t provide any benefit or correlation. I need to keep researching, I’m not a social person, these few people keep me grounded. They keep me as close to sane as I can be. I’ve always been certain that I can do all of this by myself but I’m losing faith as the supernatural grows vaster and deeper. I need whatever help anyone can provide to push me in the right direction. Life isn’t all about the rat race, it’s about doing what you can to stay on top of what resides beneath us.\n\n\nEntries like the Phoenix aren’t anything to worry about, it’d the start of a very long list. It’s a rabbit hole that you can’t escape. Some may argue it’s destructive, but I want to feel like I’m in control of my own life. I don’t want to be under the jurisdiction of a higher entity. I won’t remain oblivious or complacent, i want to be the last stood against them even when I’m drenched in my own fear. I’m not sure what’s going on to me and my social network right now, but something tells me I’m about to add another entry to the list.",

        "text": "It were the first words that I read on that forsaken paper. I could recognize my brother’s handwriting, scrabbled rapidly on a thin piece of paper. I should not have come looking for him. \n\nIt is the second week after he had gone missing. Vanished into thin air, all of the reports had said. Probably a drug addict that had overdosed and fallen in the river, was how the local news covered it up. I knew differently. I knew my brother.  He was no addict, and he was certainly not dead. \nAt least, that was what I believed until I read those words with shaking hand. For your convenience I shall recite his words here, in the hope they may serve you better than they did me.\n\nIf you read this, I am dead. I am sorry little brother, for leaving you stranded in this place all by yourself. I hope you never find this letter, but I know that you are as stubborn and loyal as a dog. You will come looking for me. \nWhatever is out there with me, it is not human. It hunts our bloodline. Father must have provoked it in his past, you know how the man is. \nIt is too late for me, it is coming. Still, I can try to save you. Listen to me carefully, trust me like you always did and follow these rules. You may come out of this alive.\n\n1. Do no fight it, it will overpower you. Even your gun will not be able to kill it. Against this thing, we are powerless and believe me, I have tried to kill it.\n2. Do not look into its eyes. First of all, if it can see you, you will probably not live long enough for the insanity to grip you. I do not know which death is worse.\n3. Do not trust any of the safety you come across. Life has forsaken this place. Any you find are either some of its tricks to get you to lower your guard , or some other creature that wishes nothing more than to devour your soul. \n4. No matter how bad things become, do not make an end to your own life. Your soul still has to leave these accursed lands, and if you die here, it shall not reach happy places. Fight with all your might to get out, mom would have wanted you to survive this.\n5. Do not trust…\n\nThe words do not continue after the first three words of the fifth rule.

        "text": "I was the victim of a break-in, someone came to my house and took something so important from me that my life is empty without it and it could happen to you too. \n\nAbout a month ago, in the early days of December, I was awoken by a sound in the night. My mind went into an overdrive, however not because I was scared but because I had always been prepared for an intruder. I picked up my gun and slowly went to confront the thief in my home. \n\nI lived alone and while I was not in a particularly dangerous part of town, break ins did occur here. So I bought my gun for safety a couple of years ago, being only twenty seven years old I needed to be able to defend myself. However what I didn't know was that It wasn't possible to defend myself from what was in my home\n-\n\nI was only able to put this together recently but I learnt that we live in a three dimensional world. In a three dimensional world we can interact with other three dimensional beings, but we also have power over two dimensional beings. To them we are God's. \n\nPicture for a second a drawing of a little Girl, We'll call her Sally. In the drawing Sally is holding a box, in the box she has her candy because she doesn't want anyone to steal it. The problem is that because she is two dimensional she can only guard four sides of the box. \n\nThe top, the bottom, the side directly facing her and the side facing away from her. However as a three dimensional being we have access to six sides of the box, the four sides Sally is guarding and two extra sides that she doesn't know exist. Which means we can sneak in and steal Sally's candy from her without her even knowing, from the sides of the box she can't even comprehend. \n-\n\nI slowly made my way down the stairs and towards the sound, sneaking around every corner because the intruder could have been anywhere in my house. The thought of someone I didn't know, looking through my things made me sick so I checked every room and even though I could hear the sounds, I couldn't see anyone. When I finally got to the kitchen I came to the realisation that there probably wasn't any intruder in my home. Instead a small animal like a rat or squirrel must have broken in. I had become all defensive for nothing. \n\nThe pain I felt next was nothing like I ever felt before, I can't begin to describe it accurately but to put it simply it felt like someone had shoved their hand into my back and was pulling out my internal organs. I knew what this was, I was dying. I had either been stabbed or shot in the back and the world around was slowly fading from bright to black. Than there was nothing for a while.\n\nDeath is exactly what you imagine it to be, I awoke in my kitchen in our world, but it was different. There was a tint of blue all around, I felt empty inside and it was incredibly cold. By that point I didn't know how long I had been dead for but they had probably already taken my body away and put me in a morgue freezer. That would explain how I was feeling, there was probably some mortician poking around my insides, taking out my organs and trying to find out my cause of death. My conscience, most probably linked to my soul, was just floating around in the place I died. The only thing left now was to figure out what to do next.\n\nI was terrified of being dead, there was so much I hadn't done yet, there were so many people I wanted to say goodbye to. I would never be able to do those things or see those people because as you know, the dead can't communicate with the living. I could feel the fear deep in my bones.\n\nNow, according to pop culture, the only thing I had left to do was find the light. \n\nI searched every room in my home but there was no light to be found. So I stepped outside into the early morning. It was empty just like I expected it to be, but it was still unmistakably blue. Maybe this wasn't home, maybe this was purgatory.\n\nWhen I reached the street in front of me I pondered which way to go, the light at the end of the road or tunnel could be anywhere in this town, anywhere in this world. I could be searching for years.\n\nI was startled once again by the sound coming from next door, something was stepping out the door, would it be a monster, a ghost. Maybe it was a demon who would torture me and I was actually in hell being punished. \n\nIt was none of those things, instead my neighbour Jim stepped out, his work uniform on. Just like every morning he made his way to his car, turned it on and reversed out of his driveway. Stopping in front of me he let out a Polite \"Hello\".\n\n\"You can see me\" I said, a little more panicked than I should have.\n\n\"Yes of course\" He smiled back \"Which is unfortunate because you're in your boxers, you may want to change kid\".\n\nHe drove away and I found myself embarrassed, I literally overreacted and thought I was dead. I hurried inside and checked my home for an intruder once again. There was no one there and I couldn't figure out why I passed out. I would soon find something though as when I went to change for work I noticed a strange mark on my body. \n\nOn my lower back, where the pain had first hit me, there was a dark red mark with scarring all over it. I don't remember ever being hurt in that area.\n\nThe day went on as usual and everyone could see me, I spoke to everyone and nothing was out of the ordinary for them. For me however the world remained blue and cold, and since that day, that's how it's always been. \n\nI saw a doctor later that week and he did confirm that it was a burn mark, nothing more and nothing less. When I told him I had never been injured in that spot he said it must have happened as a child and that I probably just  didn't remember it.\n\nIn the weeks that I followed I desperately tried to ignore the changes in my life but I couldn't. I couldn't ignore feeling freezing cold, I couldn't ignore the blue tint around me and I couldn't ignore the empty feeling inside. Something was stolen from me that night but it wasn't a physical object. \n \nAbout a week ago I was finally able to put together a theory and my conclusion was that even though I was alive, I was still dead. You see the cold, the missing parts of me and the shades of blue were all signs that even though I was present in the human world, I was missing the thing that made me human. That being my soul.\n\nWithout my soul I was just a corpse walking around.\n\nThe invisible intruder that entered my home a while ago had stolen my soul from me, without me even knowing, the only evidence being the burn mark on my back. As far as I can tell there is only one type of being that can steal something without the victim knowing. \n\nAs three dimensional beings we can steal candy from Sally, a two dimensional being, without her knowing. We are like God's to her. However what if we are not the last dimension. What if there was something above us, that could steal things from us without us knowing, with access to parts of us that we can't comprehend. A fourth dimensional being.",

        "text": "I think everyone who has ever had a babysitting job has had that moment of pure terror while running around a semi-unfamiliar house at 11:20pm desperately looking for something and just praying that the parents don’t get home before you find it. In most cases I bet the item would be a special stuffed toy the kid can’t sleep without or a pacifier. In my case it was a stapler because the worms were spilling out of the baby’s seams and I had to get that thing put back together before the parents came home.\n \nI hope I’ve set the scene for you but here are a few more details. Hi, I’m Riley, I’m a 17-year-old girl and I am the oldest kid in my neighborhood and the de facto babysitter. Most of the kids in the neighborhood are under the age of 7 and I’ve been babysitting them since I was 14 so you could say I know these kids pretty well. But it doesn’t take an attentive babysitter to tell when the kid has been replaced by a baby-shaped sack full of worms. Except, I’m the only person who seems to even notice that the kids in the neighborhood are no longer kids. The kids’ parents haven’t noticed, my parents haven’t noticed, and the other kids (before they, too, became worm sacks) haven’t noticed. \n\nYou might think (and I did too, at first) that I was absolutely losing it. I went to a neighbor’s house one night last year to babysit while the parents went out for a few hours. It was already late but the mom said the kid was having trouble sleeping so I should hold him until he nodded off. She was holding him and when she went to hand him to me I saw that it was not a baby, it was a bag. A burlap looking sack in a vaguely baby shape. I took the “baby” and held it. I squinted at the mom and then over at the dad. I didn’t notice anything sus, except, well, bag baby. Both parents were acting normal. The mom leaned down and kissed the bag baby on its head and then they left. I stood there for a few minutes before I noticed that the bag baby was moving. On closer inspection it seemed like the bag was full of something…not really squishy but a little squishy and it was moving, writhing. I held the sack up in front of me Lion King style and lightly jiggled it back and forth. Something plopped onto the floor. A worm.\n\n***\n\nBy the time the parents got back I had tucked the thing into bed and was sitting on the couch scrolling through my phone watching TikToks of people describing what it’s like to hallucinate. Obviously that’s what I was experiencing. \n“Ew,” I heard the mom say.\n“What’s wrong?” The dad said.\n“I stepped on a worm, gross.”\nA worm. The worm that fell out of their baby. It landed on the floor and I watched it squirm towards the side door where the parents had just come in. The mom stepped on it. A worm, a real thing. So I wasn’t crazy, which is good, but the baby was a worm bag, which was probably not good. But hey, maybe a one off, right?\nWrong. All of them are worm bags. Well, all except one. \n\n***\n\nBefore I go on, I should explain that the baby sacks are not the only weird thing going on in the neighborhood. All the pet dogs are avoiding the babies, some growling at them. A few people have had to rehome their pets. One person had to rehome their cat after it attacked a “kid.” There’s also been strange sounds at night. Scraping like trees against a window, even windows where there are no trees. Wailing, almost cat-like sounds coming from the woods. People’s trash was getting knocked over more than usual but no one had seen any raccoons or other usual suspects. This has all been going on for a little over a year. All the kids are bags o’ worms except one, a 7-year-old named Camille. Her brother, Connor, has been bagged for a few months I think. I don’t watch these two very often but when I do it’s usually from Friday evening to pretty early Saturday morning. I usually pass out in the guest room reading and the parents wake me up and drive me home even though I can walk back. They are nice people and I like Camille a lot. Her brother was a cute, quiet kid. He’s quiet now too, but definitely not cute. \n\nAnyway, back to it. It was a Friday, 11pm, I was reading in the guest room. Camille was asleep and Conner was a sack and the parents said they might be home by midnight but this is doubtful because it’s usually closer to 3am and one time it was 6am. \nI was about halfway through The Grace Year and I was really getting into it. Then I heard the scratching at the window. I ignored it as long as I could but when I couldn’t take it anymore I got up to check on the kids. Camille’s room was right across from the guest room, a small bathroom was at the end of the hall with us. Her door was open and a night light was on so I could see her in the dim light. I pushed the door open a little more. Her bed was against the same wall as the door. She was sound asleep. I heard the scratching at her window. For some reason I started to feel uneasy. As quietly as I could, I walked across her floor, carpeted, luckily, and peered out the window. I didn’t hear or see anything at first. Then, something…maybe. A shape on the ground. It was hard to see because it was dark and I was on the second floor. There was a streetlamp but it really just helped to make more shadows than to light anything up. But there might have been something… about the size of a large cat. \n\nI went down the hall to Connor’s room. His door was also slightly open and his night light was on. His crib was also against the wall near the door. I looked in on him. Yup, still sack. I was about to go back to the guest room when I saw something moving against the light blue of his blankets. Worms. Fuck. There were a bunch of them. I flipped the light on and picked sack-Connor up. More worms spilled out of a hole in his little sack foot. I started to get anxious. I scooped up the worms and turned Connor upside down and tried to stuff them back inside. But I only managed to make the hole bigger. I very quickly went from low-key anxiety to very, very high-key freaking out. I put Connor back in his crib and ran into the bathroom. I looked in the cabinets for something, I didn’t really know what I was looking for. Band-Aids? No, that won’t work, maybe tape? I shoved everything back and ran downstairs. I started searching through drawers, still no plan in my head. Then I thought of it, a stapler! \n\nBy now it was 11:20pm and if the parents were going to come home early on any night it would be my luck that this would be the night. I had no idea if they would be able to “see” the baby for what it was if it lost all its worms. Would it, like, die? I was not going to find out. Finally, in a junk drawer, I found a mini stapler with purple staples. It will have to do, I told myself as I ran back up the stairs. Connor was still hemorrhaging worms. I picked him up and started scooping. When I finally had all the worms back inside him I started to staple. \n\nWhen I was done I set Connor back gently into the crib then flipped the light back off with the back of my hand. I went to the bathroom and washed my hands.\n\n“Riley?” I heard Camille say my name. I pushed the bathroom door open and saw her standing in the hall.\n\n“What’s up, Camille?” I asked.\n\nShe rubbed one of her eyes and gave me an annoyed look. \n\n“You’re making A LOT of noise,” she said.\n\n“Oh yeah, sorry about that,” I put my hand on the top of her head and steered her back into her room. I turned the lamp on her bedside table on and scanned the room, just in case.\n\n“What are you looking for?” She asked.\n\n“Just looking. Ok, back in bed.”\n\nShe climbed back into her bed and pulled the sheets up over her knees. She was still sitting up and giving me a look I couldn’t really figure out.\n\n“Were you outside?” She asked.\n\n“No,” I said and glanced at the window. “I was just looking for something downstairs and I guess I was a little loud.”\n\nCamille sighed dramatically and said “A LOT of loud.”\n\nI smiled and went to turn off the lamp when Camille screamed.\n\nI whipped around to where she was looking, the doorway, and something was there. Hunched over. Something the size of a cat, with greenish, leathery skin and a long neck and claws on its long limbs. \n“Shit!” I yelled. I dove onto the bed, partially covering Camille, to shield her but also so I could grab one of her giant Squishmallows and hurl it at the thing. It hit it and the thing screeched and jumped back into the hallway. I heard scratching at the window, loud and insistent. \n\n“Oh my god, they’re going to turn you into worms,” I muttered.\n\n“I don’t want to be worms!” Camille screamed. I grabbed her by the wrist and yanked her out of the bed. The room wasn’t safe. I dragged her out into the hall. The creature I’d hit was at the stairs, another one, bigger with large, dropping ears, was coming up the stairs. It was cradling something in its sinewy arms. A sack. A big, 7-year-old sized sack, full of worms. \n\n“They’re replacing you with worms!”\n\n“Riley, don’t let them make me worms!” Camille was sobbing. The scratching at the window was deafening. There were little mews and screeches coming from the window and from the three creatures in front of us. I ran forward and kicked the thing holding the sack as hard as I could. I was hoping to knock it down the stairs, instead it hissed and dropped the sack and jumped onto the railing. I dragged Camille behind me and ran clumsily down the stairs. I heard the window shatter.\n\nMore creatures were on the first floor. Maybe this was a bad move. Maybe we should have stayed upstairs. Maybe we could make it outside to another house. I ran into the kitchen, basically dragging Camille on the floor behind me. \n\n“Riley! You’re hurting me!” Camille sobbed. I yanked her closer to me and held her in a hug.\n\n“I know, I’m sorry, let’s try and get out of here.”\n\nWe were standing near the refrigerator. The door to the sun room was on the other side of the kitchen. If we could get to the sunroom and lock it, we could either stay in there or go out the back door and run to a neighbor’s. The creatures were creeping into the kitchen. They seemed a little more hesitant now, realizing that I was willing to fight back, I guess. Then one, a little bolder than the others, leapt onto the island counter. We were eye to eye now. Its eyes were droopy and a filmy white. Its mouth curled into a smile, it had all these sharp, white teeth, too many to count. It reached out a hand and I saw its back legs tense. It was ready to jump. I ducked, slamming Camille onto the floor under me. The refrigerator door opened when the creature grabbed it to keep itself up. Another creature jumped onto the counter, also ready to pounce. \n\n“Stay there,” I said to Camille and used both hands to grab a drawer from the fridge. I swung it at the creature on the counter, lunch meat and cheese flying all over the kitchen. The one that had opened the fridge swiped at me. I managed to dodge and grabbed another drawer out and smashed it into its head. Then I started grabbing everything I could from the counter and fridge and just hurling them at anything that moved. The creatures were hissing and dodging cabbages and ketchup and a decorative ceramic bowl. I grabbed a carton of orange juice and a carton of cream, one in each hand, and started to pummel one of the creatures over the head with them. The orange juice opened and started to leak all over me, the creature and the floor. The cream quickly followed. \n\nThen…silence. It was so abrupt I jumped at the sudden absence of sound, then jumped again at the sensation of my wrist being licked by a rough, cat-like tongue. \n\nThe creature I had been beating over the head was gently cradling my hand and licking the cream from my wrist and the back of my hand. I stood there, left hand raised still holding the dripping orange juice carton above my head. Camille lifted her head up and looked at me and the creature.\n\n“R-Riley?” She stammered. \n\n“Shhh,” I whispered. I lowered the orange juice carton and set it on the counter then I used my now free hand to fully open the cream carton. The liquid flowed onto the floor and three more creatures scuttled over to the forming puddle. They bent down and began to lap it up. I put my finger against the forehead of the creature holding my hand and gently pushed it backwards. It let go of my hand and looked up at me with its milky eyes. I handed it the carton and it took it with both hands. \n\n“Camille, let’s go,” I said quietly. She grabbed my hand and I helped her up off the floor. Maybe 10 of the critters were sitting quietly in the kitchen, hunched over and licking the sticky floor. We started to walk towards the sunroom door but one of the creatures jumped in front of us with a hiss. It put one clawed hand up as if to say “stop.” I heard chittering sounds behind me and glanced over my shoulder. One of them was standing on its hind legs holding something wrapped in a dingy blanket close to its chest. It walked over to us and held out the bundle. \n\nIt was Connor. The real, live, actual baby, not a sack full of worms, Connor. He was sleeping, his eyes scrunched close and his hand shoved in his mouth. I took him from the creature’s outstretched arms. It nodded at me then let out a series of hisses and clicks. A forked tongue slipped between a gap in its sharp front teeth. All the creatures gathered around the hissing one then they began to lope towards the stairs. I stood there holding skin-Connor in my arms, Camille holding onto my leg. After a while, I couldn’t hear the creatures anymore, just the dripping of orange juice from the counter to the floor. \n\n“Are we not going to be worms now?” Camille asked.\n\n“I don’t think so,” I answered. \n\n***\n\nIt was surprisingly easy to explain the sticky and destroyed kitchen away. And the broken window upstairs. A raccoon, obviously. I did have to go in for a rabies shot but I don’t think that was a bad idea. I don’t know what those things were. I also don’t know why all the kids in the neighborhood are returning, but they are. Every few days it seems like another worm bag is replaced (re-replaced?) by a skin baby. The only thing I am sure of is it's not a bad idea to keep a little dog bowl in my backyard filled with cream.",

        "text": "I was a typical college student, struggling to make ends meet and trying to stay afloat in a sea of student loan debt. My parents had immigrated to the United States from China when I was a child, and like many first-generation immigrants, they had sacrificed so much to give me the opportunity to go to college. But even with their support, I still found myself struggling to keep up with the high cost of tuition and living expenses. I had to work multiple part-time jobs just to get by, and even then, it was a struggle. \n\nBut then, one day, a friend of mine came to me with a proposition. She told me that her aunt was a traditional Chinese matchmaker, and she had a client who was looking for someone to marry a \"ghost bride.\" I had heard of the concept before - it was an old tradition where, when a woman died before getting married, her family would find a man to marry her in death, lifting the shame of being husbandless for eternity. It was a bizarre, almost superstitious idea, and I initially said no, thinking it was silly and that my parents wouldn't be happy about it.\n\n\"Jin, please, just hear her out,\" my friend pleaded. \"She's offering a lot of money. It could really help you out with your tuition and bills.\"\n\nI was torn. The idea of marrying a ghost seemed absurd. But I desperately needed the money. I agreed to meet with the matchmaker. She was an elderly woman with a kind face and a gentle demeanor. She was dressed in a red silk qipao, a traditional Chinese dress, and her graying hair was pulled back into a bun. She greeted me with a warm smile and invited me to sit down.\n\n\"I'm glad you've decided to consider my proposal,\" she said, her voice soft and soothing. \"I understand that this may seem strange to you, but it is an ancient tradition that has been passed down for generations. It is a way to honor the spirit of the deceased and bring peace to her family.\"\n\nI nodded, still feeling a bit skeptical. \"I'm just not sure if I'm comfortable with the idea of marrying a ghost,\" I admitted.\n\nThe matchmaker nodded sympathetically. \"I understand your hesitation. It can be a difficult concept to wrap your head around. But let me assure you, this is not a real marriage. It is simply a symbolic gesture to honor the deceased and lift the burden of shame from her family. You are not expected to have any physical or emotional connection to the ghost bride.\"\n\nShe reached into her desk and pulled out a check, sliding it across the table towards me. I gasped when I saw the amount. It was more than enough to cover all of my tuition and living expenses for the rest of the year.\n\n\"In return for your help, you will receive this generous sum as a token of appreciation for your role in this tradition,\" the matchmaker said with a twinkle in her eye. \"It is a small price to pay for the opportunity to bring peace and honor to the spirit of the deceased.\"\n\nI stared at the check, my mind racing. The matchmaker’s words were persuasive. Anway, I didn't believe in ghosts, and I figured it would be a quick, easy way to make some much-needed cash. I decided to accept the proposal right there. \n\nThe day of the ceremony had finally arrived. As I stood at the altar, surrounded by the smell of incense and the sound of chanting, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over me. The wedding ceremony was taking place in a small, dimly-lit temple, filled with the pictures of the bride's ancestors, all of whom seemed to be staring at me with disapproving glares.\n\nThe bride's family was in attendance, huddled together in the front row. They were a wealthy, traditional Chinese family, and I could tell they weren't thrilled about the idea of their daughter being married off to a stranger. But they had agreed to the arrangement in order to lift the burden of shame from their daughter's ghost, and they were going through with the ceremony with grim determination.\n\nThe priest was an old, wizened man, who looked like he'd seen a thing or two in his time. He was officiating the ceremony with a mixture of reverence and skepticism, as if he wasn't sure whether to take the whole thing seriously or not. The matchmaker was there as well and was probably the only one who looked perfectly at ease.\n\nThe ghost bride was represented by an effigy made of bamboo, adorned with real clothing and fake jewelry. As for me, I was standing at the altar, feeling like I'd made a terrible mistake. I had agreed to this arrangement for the money, but now, as I stood there, about to marry a dead woman I'd never previously met, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd made a deal with the devil. But it was too late and I repeated my vows as instructed. The priest placed the bride’s ancestral tablet inside the effigy to animate her spirit. As the ceremony came to a close, the effigy was fed the wedding feast. In a final, terrifying act, the effigy was burned to be sent to the spirit world.\n\nThe next few days after the wedding were no different than before. If anything, I slept better with the peace of mind that my full year's tuition was accounted for. But the calm didn't last long. One morning, I woke up to find that the objects in my room were in different places than where I left them the night before. At first, I brushed it off as the result of my forgetful mind, but as the days passed, I started to feel a creeping sense of unease. Every night, I was visited in my dreams by a ghostly figure - a bride, dressed in red and translucent as fog. I tried to tell myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me, but the dreams felt too real, too vivid.\n\nI had always thought of ghosts as nothing more than a creation of overactive imaginations and superstitious minds. But as the ghost bride became more and more aggressive, appearing to me in terrifying visions that left me feeling drained and terrified when I woke up, I couldn't help but wonder if there might be something more to it. Maybe it was my guilt and insecurity getting the better of me. After all, I had married a ghost bride for the money. Maybe my subconscious was punishing me for it, I reasoned.\n\nI tried to avoid sleeping as much as possible, but eventually, exhaustion took over and I drifted off into a restless sleep, praying that this time, the ghost bride wouldn't appear in my dreams. But she always did. Every time she visited me in a nightmare, I woke up in a panic, my heart racing and my breath coming in short gasps. I couldn't stay in the room with her, so I ran out onto the balcony, seeking refuge in the cool night air. I stayed out there for hours, staring up at the stars and trying to clear my mind of the terror that the ghost bride’s image had inflicted upon me in my dreams.\n\nThe sleepless nights were taking their toll on me. I was tired all the time, and it was affecting my ability to concentrate in class. I knew I couldn't keep this up forever. Sooner or later, I was going to have to face my fear head on and find a way to banish her from my dreams once and for all. But I didn't know how. I didn't know where to start. All I knew was that I couldn't keep running forever. Eventually, I was going to have to stand my ground and fight back.\n\nBut the ghost bride had other plans.\n\nI was lying in bed one night, my eyes closed as I tried to get some rest. It had been a long, difficult day, and all I wanted to do was escape into the peaceful oblivion of sleep. But just as I was starting to drift off, I felt a sudden chill sweep through the room. My eyes snapped open, and I saw her - the ghost bride, standing at the foot of my bed.\n\nHer pale, translucent skin was stretched tightly over her bones, giving her a gaunt, skeletal appearance. Her red wedding dress was torn and tattered, hanging off her thin frame like cobwebs. And her eyes - oh, her hazel eyes. They were cold and empty, staring right into my soul.\n\nI couldn't move. I was frozen in place, my heart racing in my chest as I stared at the ghost bride. She didn't say anything at first, just stood there, watching me with that empty gaze. But then, she opened her mouth and spoke, her voice a whisper that sent shivers down my spine. \"You should have never married me,\" she said. \"You don't belong to me. You never will.\"\n\nI was terrified. I could feel the fear coursing through my veins, making my hands shake and my heart race. I wanted to run, to escape this nightmare and never look back. But I couldn't. My body wouldn't cooperate. I was trapped, unable to move as the ghost bride stood there, watching me with those cold, empty eyes.\n\nAnd then, she disappeared, melting away into the darkness like a wisp of smoke. I was left alone, trembling and terrified, wondering what this all meant. What did the ghost bride want from me? Why was she haunting me like this? And most importantly, how could I make it stop? I couldn't go on like this, with the ghost bride terrorizing me every night. So, I decided to do some research and try to find a way to exorcise her from my life.\n\nI started by reaching out to a local spiritualist, a woman who claimed to have experience with exorcisms. She listened to my story with a skeptical expression on her face, and then shook her head. \"I'm sorry, but this is beyond my abilities,\" she said. \"You've made a deal with the ancestors, and there's no easy way out of it.\"\n\nI tried other alternatives, seeking out ancient rituals and seeking the advice of traditional healers, but none of them seemed to be able to help me. It was like I was trapped in this nightmare, with no way out.\n\nAs the days went by, her visits became more frequent and I started to feel like I was losing my mind. I tried to ignore her, but it was impossible when she was standing right in front of me, asking me what I liked about her or why I married her. My body shook uncontrollably every time she appeared. Cold sweats drenched my body and my scalp felt red hot as the fear took over. Paranoia and anxiety gripped me as I struggled to maintain any sense of normalcy. I lashed out at those around me, snapping at friends for no reason. I became isolated and distant, trapped in this cycle of fear and desperation.\n\nI was on the brink of losing my mind completely. I couldn't sleep, eat, or function properly. I was trapped in this endless cycle of terror, and I could only hope that somehow, I'd find a way to escape the ghost's grasp and return to a normal life.\n\n\\---------  \n\n\nI was at my wit's end, desperate for a way out. And then, one day, I stumbled upon an old, dusty tome in the library, filled with ancient rituals and spells. I wasn't sure if it would work, but I was willing to try anything at this point.\n\nAs I started to read through the book, I realized that many of the rituals were designed to appease the spirits, rather than banish them. And that's when I got an idea. Maybe, instead of trying to exorcise the ghost bride, I could try to appease her, to find a way to make her happy.\n\nI spent the next few days researching the ghost bride's family and their customs, trying to find a way to honor her and show her respect. I discovered that they were a traditional Chinese family, and that they placed a great emphasis on ancestor worship and the importance of maintaining harmony in the family. \n\nWith this information in mind, I set to work preparing a series of offerings and prayers that I hoped would appease the ghost bride. I started by setting up a small altar in my room, placing a photograph of the ghost bride in a prominent position. Then, I gathered some of her favorite foods – pineapples and mangoes – and drinks and placed them on the altar as offerings.\n\nNext, I lit some incense and recited a series of prayers, asking the ancestors to accept my offerings and to bless the ghost bride with peace and happiness. As I spoke the words, I could feel the ghost bride's presence in the room, watching me with those cold, empty eyes. But instead of feeling terrified, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. The ghost bride's presence slowly faded.  \n\n\nI was exhausted but exhilarated, and as I collapsed into bed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment wash over me. I'd found a way to appease the ghost bride.\n\nAs the days went by, I started to feel a sense of hope and optimism that I hadn't felt in a long time. The ghost bride's haunting had become infrequent, and I felt like I was making progress in finding a way to live peacefully with her.\n\nAnd then, something else happened that started to brighten my days. I met a woman, and we hit it off right away. Her name was Mia, and she was smart, funny, and had beautiful brown eyes. We met in one of my classes at college. We found ourselves sitting next to each other in a seminar on Chinese folklore. We bonded over our shared fascination with Eastern mythology. We started spending more and more time together, and before I knew it, I found myself falling for her.\n\nBut there was one big problem. I couldn't tell Mia about the ghost bride. I was embarrassed and ashamed of what I'd done for money, and I was afraid she'd judge me if she found out. So, I started making excuses to avoid having her visit my apartment. I told her I had a roommate who was always home, or that I was a neat freak and I didn't want her to see the mess I'd made.  \n\n\nMia was understanding, but I could tell she was starting to get a little suspicious. I felt guilty for keeping this secret from her, but I just didn't know how to tell her the truth.\n\nI was stuck in this predicament, torn between my feelings for Mia and my fear of what would happen if I told her the truth. I knew I needed to find a way to come clean, but I wasn't sure how to do it without risking everything. Every time I thought about introducing her to my ghost bride saga, my stomach would twist into knots. In the end, my fear won out, and I kept my secret hidden from her, hoping that somehow everything would work out in the end.\n\nOver time, the ghost bride's haunting had almost stopped, and I made progress in my relationship with Mia. I felt ready to move on to a new life with Mia. \n\nBut just when I thought things were starting to look up, everything fell apart.\n\nIt started with a series of strange events that could only be attributed to the ghost bride. Things went missing from my apartment, and I started to feel like I was being watched. And then, one night, the ghost bride decided to visit me again. I was in bed, trying to get some rest, when I felt a cold gust of wind sweep through my room. I opened my eyes and saw the ghost bride standing at the foot of my bed, her pale, translucent form barely visible in the darkness.\n\nShe didn't say anything at first, just stared at me with those cold, empty eyes. But then, she opened her mouth and spoke, her voice a whisper that sent shivers down my spine. \"You thought you could escape me,\" she said. \"But you were wrong. You will never be free of me.\"\n\nI could sense a new jealousy and anger in her voice, and I realized that she was upset about my relationship with Mia. \"You shouldn't be with her,\" the ghost bride said. \"You belong to me. You always will.\"\n\nI had reached the end of my rope. I didn't know how much longer I could go on like this, with the ghost bride haunting me and threatening to tear apart my relationship with Mia. I was starting to think the only way to put an end to this nightmare was to leave everything behind and start over. I knew I had to also come clean to Mia and tell her everything. It was the only way to move on and start a new life together.\n\n\"Mia,\" I said, my voice shaking as I finally gathered the courage to confess. \"There's something I need to tell you. I've been keeping a secret from you, and I'm sorry. I married a ghost bride for the money, and I've been haunted by her ever since.\" I went on to tell her everything about my wedding with the ghost bride and my life since then.\n\nMia's eyes widened in shock, but to my surprise, she didn't pull away from me. \"Jin, that's a lot to take in,\" she said, taking my hand in hers. \"But I'm here for you. We'll figure out a way to deal with this together.\"\n\nI felt a weight lifted off my shoulders. With Mia by my side, I felt like I could find a way to put an end to this haunting once and for all.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" I said, my voice steady now. \"I think we should leave town and start over somewhere new. It's the only way we can escape the past and move on.\"\n\nTo my surprise, Mia was onboard. She had been feeling suffocated and trapped in her old life, and she was ready for a change too. We talked about our dreams and our plans for the future, and we felt like we were on the cusp of something special. We decided to sell everything we owned and set off on a road trip, determined to leave the past behind and start anew.\n\n\\---------\n\nAs we drove through the darkness, Mia by my side, leisurely munching on some fruit, we experienced a sense of freedom and possibility that had eluded us for quite some time.\n\nBut then, just when I thought everything was falling into place, my phone rang. It was the police, and they were telling me that there had been a break-in at Mia's house. \"We've found a body, and we need you to come down to the station to identify it. A neighbor gave us your phone number.\"\n\nI was in shock as I listened to the police officer's voice on the other end of the line. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. A break-in? A body? Whose body? It didn't make any sense. I was there just an hour ago. I was terrified, and I didn't know what to do.\n\nI had no idea what I was going to find when I got there. I turned to Mia, trying to gauge her reaction, but something was off. Her eyes looked different, almost hazel, and the warmth on her face was replaced by a cold, expressionless look. She put her bag of sliced pineapples down and took my phone from my hands and turned it off. Then, she looked at me and smiled.",

        "text": "[Previously...](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1054u56/i_was_never_alone_in_the_time_out_box_part_1/)\n\nThere were many voices in the box, and in time, I grew to know them by name.\n\nNaomi had been a piano prodigy in a small suburb of Atlanta. She had played Mozart and Rachmaninov flawlessly at 11. She’d lasted less than a week in the basement before asphyxiating in the Time Out Box.\n\nThen there was Brianna. A pageant queen from Charlotte. At 15, she’d been tapped as an early favorite for Miss America, after winning a case full of trophies as a child. She’d only lasted a day, panicking and choking to death on her first trip in.\n\nAt first, I could only hear their voices, but after a few trips, I found a way to see their faces. \n\nEarly, in the darkness, I’d seen the faint outline of a door. As I returned to the dark, over and over, I found a way to navigate toward it. I began to learn that my body was only a vessel that contained my breath. When I learned to leave my own breath, I could float freely through the dark, finally finding my way to open the door.\n\nOn the other side, I found seventeen girls, all hard at work building some kind of square structure out of radiant purple stones. \n\n“You’re here!” they shouted. “We’re so sorry. We thought you might be the one to make it out.”\n\n“You’re welcome to join our little tribe,” said Brianna. “Stay as long as you like.”\n\nI must have looked confused, because Naomi approached me, touching my flesh.\n\n“She’s still warm!” she shouted.\n\n“Give her time,” said Brianna, rolling her eyes.\n\n“No, like, *warm,”* said Naomi, and then they all ran up, running their cold fingers over me.\n\n“How are you here?” asked Lilah. She was a blonde girl who’d earned a black belt by the age of 11. And it had meant nothing when the Keeper grabbed her off a suburban street in broad daylight.\n\nAnd then suddenly, the sarcophagus cracked open and I saw the Keeper staring down at me. He was different this time, blood soaking through his white shirt, pain on his face.\n\n“Are you okay?” I asked.\n\nHe grimaced. “You see?” he asked. “You see what you do to me?” He paced the room as I slowly sat up, the feeling returning to my limbs. “You get me so worked up that I get up there and make mistakes. I get up there and do terrible things, reckless things. I’m not careful like I should be. And then sometimes I get hurt.”\n\nHe unbuttoned his dress shirt to reveal this skeletal body, but this time something was wrong. A red, bleeding wound decorated his left shoulder blade. \n\n“Can you sew?” he asked.\n\nSeveral minutes later, I stood over the Keeper with a needle and thread. I’d already washed the wound with soap and warm water, then sterilized it with stinging alcohol. Applying that painful bottle had been my greatest joy in weeks.\n\n“I have entrusted you with a needle,” he said, as I stared down at him. “I fully understand that you may want to hurt me. Please know that this would be a fatal mistake. You certainly wouldn’t kill me, and your punishment would be severe. A length of time in the box that none would ever survive.”\n\nPart of me wanted to jam the needle right into his heart and hope for the best, but I knew he was right. It was much more likely that I’d pay the price than he would.\n\nI was a good sewer for my age, having spent a summer learning quilting from my grandmother, but I’d never run a needle through human flesh before.\n\n“The key to piercing skin is to think of it as something else at first. An orange peel or a leather couch,” said the keeper. “In time, it won’t bother you. Work neatly and efficiently. As I’ve said, fail, and your punishment will be beyond your reckoning. There are things that I can do to you here, out in the world, before your trip to the box that most people have never taken the time to imagine.”\n\nI tried to steady my hands and I held the needle to his skin. The cut wasn’t especially long, but I figured I’d need at least three or four stitches to close it. \n\n*It’s just an orange peel,* I told myself, trying not to imagine what might happen if I failed. *It’s not a person.*\n\nAnd I began to sew.\n\nThe first piercing caused him to wince slightly. I moved the needle gently under the skin and brought it out the far side of the wound. Then around and around. He was right, the skin acted like any other fabric in the end, pulling taught and neat as I pulled the sutures tight.\n\nWhen it was all done, the Keeper rose and plucked the needle from my finger. Then he awkwardly reached around his back and cut the thread with a pair of scissors. He hadn’t trusted me with those. He ran his long bony fingers along the stitches, examining them in a large mirror.\n\n“Well done,” he said, though he sounded slightly disappointed. Something was burning behind his eyes.\n\n“He’s no god,” said Naomi the next time I visited the box. We were sitting on the stone structure, dipping our feet in a river made of clouds. Something in me said it was important not to look too long at the rushing mist. Once, when my gaze lingered there, I saw something caught in the flow: an old woman swimming desperately against the current before being swept away.\n\n“He’s full of confidence, but it’s all a fraud,” said Brianna. “Why do you think his statues are bolted down? Why wouldn’t he even let you touch those scissors? He’s terrified of you.”\n\nAs we spoke, the sound of scraping rocks filled the air, and we looked back to see a group of six girls pushing a heavy stone up a ramp of slippery sand, and as they put the stone in place, I began to see the structure for what it truly was: the base of a pyramid.\n\nAbove us, the doorway back to the sarcophagus hung like a rectangular constellation in the sky. And suddenly, the whole plan became clear: the pyramid’s top would lead directly to the door, allowing them to climb out.\n\n“We’re going to get you out,” said Naomi. “But you won’t be alone.”\n\n“We’ll all be coming with you,” said Brianna. “All up here.” She gently caressed my temple, her dead hand as cool as tap water. Suddenly, I no longer felt safe. \n\nAll at once, I saw the other girls as they were: dead souls taken too soon for their bodies, desperate for any chance to return to the world. My flesh stung where Brianna had touched me, as if I’d run an icicle across it.\n\nI backed away from them then and felt myself floating up, back toward the door.\n\n“Don’t be afraid,” said Brianna. “We only want to help.”\n\n“Escape lies not in one direction, but all at once,” Naomi called after me. “Look to the west. To the north!”\n\nI found myself back in the sarcophagus, barely able to catch my breath. Reaching out with my right hand, I found the small button and pushed it hard, feeling the light stream of oxygen entering around me.\n\nThen I began to feel around with my left hand, running my fingers around the outline of the long-forgotten country mapped there. This time, though, I let my fingers run further up the side of the box, and there, I found another button. I pressed this too, and I heard the faint grind of something within the bowels of the stone. More air ran over my fingers now.\n\nNext, I felt along the bottom edge of the box with my toes, scooting my body down so that my feet could reach the corners. There, I found another button. *South.* I pressed it with my toe and heard a louder sound above me. I could tell something was opening above me, a small compartment just at the level of my belly.\n\n*North,* something whispered.\n\nI released the button with my right hand and felt around the box near my head. Finally, I found it. But pressing this button only seemed to move the box’s secret mechanism as much as before. I needed a way to push all four buttons simultaneously. \n\nThen, the box lid opened, and the Keeper looked down at me. Beside him was another girl, just my age. She had red hair and more freckles than anyone could ever count.\n\n“Impossible,” he whispered. “You were inside more than a day.”\n\n“It only seemed like a moment,” I whispered through chapped lips.\n\nHe turned to the other girl, whose eyes were wide with fright.\n\n“Run,” I whispered, but I’m not sure if she heard me.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” he said, turning to the new girl. “I thought there’d be a place for you here. This is no fault of yours, just poor planning on my part.”\n\nThen, without another word, he took the scissors from his pocket and stabbed her in the neck. She fell to the floor with him on top of her. He stabbed her torso over and over again, blood streaming out a dozen wounds, splattering the walls and floor. She barely had time to gurgle a scream.\n\nI wanted so badly to fling myself at him, to stop what I was seeing, but my limbs barely functioned after so long in the box. All I could do was watch the life leave her eyes as the blood pooled around her.\n\nFinally, the Keeper stood, watching the blood drip from his hands.\n\n“You see what you make me do,” he whispered. “Another day it is, then. And if you get out, you’ll be cleaning up this mess.”\n\nBefore I could say a thing, the lid closed back on top of me.\n\n*Please,* I heard the voices calling. *Don’t be afraid. Together we can be in all directions. You only need to let us in.*\n\nI knew I was making a deal with the dead, that somehow I was giving my body to them. But I knew then that regardless of the consequences, I’d rather trust the girls than the Keeper. \n\n“Okay,” I whispered. “I invite you [in](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).”",

        "text": "My wife is the best woman in the world. She has every quality a woman can have. She's beautiful, with a slender body, pale skin, blonde hair and beautiful blue eyes. She's the embodiment of the perfect woman. Our two kids, a boy and a girl, have (thankfully) inherited her beauty, and have even been in a toy commercial when they were younger. This is honestly the perfect life and I could not wish for anything more.\n\nWe met 12 years ago and have really hit it off really quick. 1 year into dating we got married and after 2 years we already had kids. It just shows how much I love her. Well, she has her quirks, but it's just how people are, we all have our little thing. Our first share of troubles started about 2 years ago, when we got into a car accident. My wife was heavily injured with a punctured lung and a pretty huge concussion. I prayed day and night for her safety, and miraculously, she made it out alive! It took about 3 weeks for her to be discharged and we went back to being a happy family.\n\nNow, this is where it gets a bit weird, so I'm going to need your advice. I've put up with it for a while since I thought it might have been the after-effects of the accident but.. she doesn't really talk much anymore. I don't understand why, since she actually used to be the talkative type. She's very lazy and doesn't do any chores, hell, I even have to feed and wash her myself. I don't want to take her to a doctor since I know they'll try to keep her there, like at the time with the accident. My 2 kids started to grow an attitude, calling me all sorts of names and even trying to run away from home! (Lucky I keep the doors locked at night, so they didn't really manage to do anything). I was really disappointed so as a punishment I locked them in their rooms. They we're really fucking vocal at first but with time they probably got used to it. My wife gives them food and water so they aren't starving or any of that bullshit (I know some of you were just eager to call me an abuser). Well, I digress. The thing that made me want to write this post and helped me figure out something weird is going on is that she started to fucking smell. Like, it's hard to even make love to her because of the smell. I wash her EVERY. FUCKING. DAY. to the point where there are now small scratches on her skin from the almost constant rubbing. If you want to call me an asshole for that, you can, but I care a lot about my wife's hygiene. Even if she's in this state now, I'm doing my best to help and take care of her. I know she's gonna come back and be back to her smiley, great self, but it's painful to see her like that.\n\nAny advice?",

        "text": " \n\nEmily is special. She sees things. We’re at an empty playground in a small town that time has forgotten. She’s giggling and having fun, but she’s being more persistent than usual.\n\n“I want to go home.”\n\n“I know sweetie. I’ll take you home soon.”\n\n“It’s always soon. It’s never tomorrow.” She giggles again and she goes higher. I’m deep in thought and I keep staring at the little drops of water running down the lengths of the chain on the swing next to us. It’s just now dawn, and getting closer to when we’ve got to get back on the road. I know it and so does she. I don’t know want to take her home. \n\n“Okay, I’m done now….Max…Max!” Her shrill little command takes a minute to pull me out of my own thoughts.\n\n“Okay. Okay, sorry.” I slow her down and she hops off the swing into the wet sand. We can’t seem to escape the rain. It’s following us. We hold hands as we walk back to the car. She skips through the puddles. I open the door for her and she climbs in the truck. She’s only eight. This isn’t what she deserves, but it’s not what I deserve either. It serves a  purpose. We’re driving for almost an hour when she stops singing to herself and starts to cry. I don’t even ask her why  because I know what’s wrong.\n\n“I miss my mom.”\n\n“I know honey.”\n\n“You said one more and we could go back.”\n\n“I know.”\n\n“Do you mean it this time? Because you’ve said that a bunch of times.” I don’t say anything because I don’t want to lie to her. How do I convince her that she should stay with me? I don’t want her to go. “Max?!”\n\n“You know…it's…” God, help me find an excuse. God, I don’t want to lose her. “It’s a good thing you’re here with me.” It’s a lame thing to say and she tells me as much. We drive for a little bit more in silence before she points to a side road off the highway.\n\n“It’s that one.” I follow her directions. There’s a lot of turns on some muddy backroads. “We’re getting close. Pull over here.”\n\nI follow her directions and pull over. I kill the engine under some gnarled oaks. I reach under the seat and pull out my mask and my gun. I know it’s loaded and ready to go, but I check it anyway. Emily just stares at me. I give her a kiss on the forehead before I put on my mask.\n\n“How many are there?” She doesn’t answer. She purses her lips and looks out the window. “Emily?”\n\n“I’m not telling.”\n\n“What?!”\n\n“You promised. You promised me so many times.” God, not now.\n\n“Emily, I… can we talk about this when I get back?” She turns back to me.\n\n“You promised. I need to go home.” I hang my head. How much longer can I argue with her? “I can hear my mom every night. She prays about me every night.”\n\n“Well you’re fine.”\n\n“She doesn’t know that Max. You need to let me go.” After all this time, I’m about to lose her forever. I shouldn’t be occupying my mind with this right now. It could make me sloppy. Things could go bad. “There’s only one of them this time.” she says. I look back up at her. She’s trying not to cry. How much longer am I going to do this?\n\n“Fine. After this one, I’ll take you back to your mother.”\n\n“You promise? Not like that means anything.” I promise her and she gives me a quick summary of everything she sees in her head about this place and the thing who lives here. She stays in the truck while I trudge through the wet underbrush. I’m being too loud, but I can’t concentrate. She’s about to leave, and there is nothing I can do. I never should have taken her, but I felt like I had no choice. \n\nFocus Max.\n\nIt’s a ranch house in the middle of ancient mossy oaks. A couple of broken cars and a muddy driveway that circles the house. The roof is bad and the paint is chipped and faded. Lots of windows and a half rotten porch that looks like it wraps around the place. There’s a barn to the right. I look at my watch. Emily said to wait for one more minute. The rain starts in a little harder. I see him now. Skinny and tall and wearing a top hat of all things out here. He walks out of the barn back to the house. He puts his hand in his pocket. She told me to move when his back was to me and his hand was in his pocket. I try to be quiet and I hold the gun up keeping it aimed squarely between his shoulder blades.\n\nI slip on mud just as I’m about to tell him to turn around. The gun goes off in my hand when I fall. \n\nIt gives him just enough time to turn and pull something out of his jacket. He’s got a gun. I manage to fire two shots into his kneecaps before he can even pull his trigger. I run over and kick his gun away from him while he writhes in agony. I pat him down real quick and then I drag him to one of the rusty cars. I take a couple zip ties out of my jacket and tie him up through the window frame. He’s babbling something. They always do. I ignore him and run into the house. I find the boy in a back bedroom that’s locked. I kick the door down. He’s still alive. I call the police and give them all the details of how to get here. I tell the boy I have to go. I tell him that he’s going to go back home. He’s crying. I have to take her back home.\n\nI always feel awful when I leave them there waiting for the police, but in the end they’re always fine. I can’t risk being caught myself. I’ve done this too many times now, and they’d lock me up and throw away the key if they knew the truth of it all.  I run back to the truck, and drive away.\n\nI keep thinking of that boy's face. How happy he was that he’s going back home. I start to think of his parents. The peace they’re about to have. Once I’m sure we’re far enough away from the scene, I pull over. It’s time.\n\n“Emily?” She’s singing to herself and looking out the window. I love it when she does that. I don’t want it to stop. “Emily?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I’ll take you back home.” Her face lights up. She knows I mean it this time.\n\n“Really?!”\n\n“Unless you’ve changed your mind.”\n\n“No! I want to see my mom!” I nod. She jumps over the seat and throws her arms around my neck. I try not to cry in front of her. I start down the highway for our last ride together. I don’t even remember what life was like before I took her with me, and I have no idea what it’s going to be like without her. I drive through the night without a single stop. After all the traveling we’ve done together, this last one was only a day away from her house. She keeps going on and on about coming home. I’m happy for her, but I admit there’s been a few times where the thought occurred to me that there was nothing she could do if I changed my mind. But I can’t. I love her too much. She saved my life. She gave me a purpose after I lost my boy.\n\nIt’s almost eight in the morning when we pull up to the old house. She’s hopping up and down on the seat.\n\n“We’re here! I’m home.”\n\n“Okay, okay. I want you to wait here.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because I need to be able to say things without you staring at me. Because I really don’t want to do this. Can you just give me a minute?” She nods her head. I hug her one last time. I try to memorize everything, her face, her smell, and her voice.\n\n“Just as long as you let her know where I am. You promised.”\n\n“I will.” I let her go. I get out of the truck and turn back to her. “I’m not going to see anymore am I?”\n\n“No.”\n\nI walk up to the front door and knock. After a moment, an old woman I used to know answers the door.\n\n“Max? Max?!” She throws her arms around me and ushers me inside. Rose gets me a cup of coffee and makes me sit down in her living room. “Oh my God! How are you?! Where did you go?” I don’t answer her question right away. I’m staring at a picture of Emily she has up on her mantlepiece. How much pain have I caused this woman? I could have given her peace a long time ago.\n\n“Uh…I’ve been…I’ve been doing a lot of things. And I’ve been pushing off what I should have done a long time ago, because I’m a selfish man.”\n\n“Everyone wondered what happened to you after all of it. You just up and left. Everybody thought you went crazy or something.”\n\n“Maybe I did.”\n\n“But you stopped that man. He might have taken more.”\n\n“That was a while ago.”\n\n“It’s been thirty years.”  I can’t take my eyes off the picture of Emily.\n\n“She was a beautiful girl, Rose.” I’m trying so hard to keep it together.\n\n“Yes she was. I just wish…”\n\n“You wish they had been able to find her.” She nods her head and shrugs her shoulders slowly. We’ve helped so many people, Emily and I. But I couldn’t bring myself to help Rose.\n\n“I know she’s gone. I know that man took her. I just wish I could bring her home.” \n\n“Rose, I have something to tell you, and if I don’t just get it out, I might never say it all.” She furrows her brow. Tears are silently building in my eyes. I have to do this. I promised Emily. I’m about to lose her.  “Rose, Emily has been with me this whole time.”\n\n“What?” She tenses up. I don’t know if she’s going to believe this. Not at first.\n\n“Thirty years ago, after Emily went missing…she came to me. She was standing in my kitchen. She told me about the man who killed her. She told me she could help me find him..”\n\n“What are you talking about?” She's scared. \n\n“She told me exactly where he was and she told me exactly where all the bodies of the children were. She did it thirty years ago, and she’s been helping me do it ever since.”\n\n“I think you should go.”\n\n“Rose please. I took her from you. I could’ve given her to you thirty years ago.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“She’s been helping me find others. She’s been helping me find people like the one who took our children. I haven’t let her go. She’s been wanting to come home to you and I haven’t let her. I can tell you where that bad man buried her. I can take you there. She told me where she was buried thirty years ago, but I couldn’t tell you. I knew she’d leave. I was selfish. She gave me a purpose.”",

        "text": "The knowledge that I gained from my first meeting with the artist Cecilia Smith gave me the chance to do something incredibly effective yet equally dangerous. Considering Ms. Smith's standing, I am certain that this gift will bring me the artistic success I am so desperate for. Yet, if I do something incorrectly, I could bring about the destruction of myself and thousands if not millions of others. \n\nAs the months wear on, I find that my desperation has been growing far stronger than my fear or guilt. I have been passively gathering all the pieces for the ritual whenever and wherever I happen to find them. Every time I find another ritual ingredient, I remember the day when I was partially awakened to the truth about everything.  \n\nI was in my sophomore year when I met Cecelia Smith. She was going to give a lecture at the art museum a few blocks away from my college. I probably would have gone to the event anyway, but Mr. Boone, my art professor, made it even more tempting. He said he would give extra credit to anyone in the class that attended the event. \n\nMr. Boone's reasons for creating the event were not purely academic, as he would later admit to us. He and Cecelia had been friends ever since college. He wanted to lend her some friendly support. \n\nEventually, the day and time of the event arrived. Unfortunately, regret flooded my body the instant I stepped into that museum. It was immediately clear to me that most of the people in attendance were wealthy patrons of the museum and/or collectors of fine art. \n\nThough I am a tall woman, I felt as though these people towered over me. Each dress or suit they wore had to cost at least twice my monthly rent. Likely, they had also spent more than my monthly salary to get their hair and/or makeup done. In comparison, I had spent ten dollars at the thrift store to buy the dress I was currently wearing and had fixed up my hair and makeup by using discount store products and video tutorials. \n\nI was so certain that this mere mortal could not be safe standing within one hundred feet of these gods and goddesses, let alone five feet. My mind soon flooded with a daymare about them simultaneously turning to look at me and walking over until they surrounded me and then mocking and laughing at my lowly appearance and then throwing the drinks and appetizers they were holding at me and then picking me up and throwing me out onto the street. \n\nThis imaginary situation repeated itself and eventually caused my body to break out in shivers. Yet, I managed to fight against the compulsion I had to rush out of those museum doors at once. My desire to see Cecelia Smith's paintings, which an online article I read had called \"signs of the beginning of a new age of art\", was far stronger than any of my fears. \n\nMy shaking body was hard to control, but I didn't let that stop me from easing myself around the rich people's conversation circles and towards the hallway just beyond the reception desk. New daymares spawned that depicted a few of them turning from their cheerful chatter and telling me how ugly I looked. Others portrayed me bumping into a rich person and causing him or her to spill their food or drink on their expensive clothing and then they would grab me and shake me violently, demanding amounts of money that I couldn't even dream of affording. \n\nThings got worse as I entered the hallway. It was rather narrow and that made many of the conversation circles seem huge. The new daymares became more dramatic as they repeated. I imagined a few of my rich victim's friends shaking me, surrounding me, and ripping off pieces of my dress and clumps of my hair. \n\nI took deep breaths through my nose and diverted my thoughts by theorizing how paintings that were \"signs of the beginning of a new age of art\" would look. Perhaps she had added clay to a canvas to make pieces of art that were both a sculpture and a painting. Or maybe she had layered different-sized canvases on top of each other to create a kind of 3D effect. However, as creative as I got, even a person five times more creative than myself could never imagine what Cecelia Smith's paintings would truly be like. \n\nFinally, I exited the hallway and entered the gallery which was, much to my relief, far more spacious than the hallway had been. There were also far fewer people here, and the individuals that were here did not appear rich. They had gathered around in small groups around paintings and chattering in voices so hushed that they may have thought loudness could cause the paintings' color to fade. \n\nI took some deep breaths and performed mindfulness exercises until my body stopped shaking. Then I hesitantly approached one of the currently solitary paintings but looked away from it as I walked. In truth, I felt afraid that the paintings wouldn't live up to the expectations that I had built up in my mind. I desperately wanted them to make the stress of walking through all those rich strangers worth it. \n\nWhen there was a certain distance between me and the painting, I stopped and waited until I felt ready to see anything in that frame. But then I realized that I would probably never be ready. So I looked up at it and felt immediately confused as the painting seemed to depict the surface of an ordinary rock. \n\nSure, there was enough high-quality detail that I could see every bump, valley, and scratch along the surface of the rock, but this couldn't be something worthy of that 'new age of art' quote. Feeling like I was about to drown in disappointment, I forcefully leaned in closer until my nose was a few inches from the painting and tried to take in every little detail. As I look back, I think I wanted to do this not just because I needed there to be something I was missing. I also wanted to flee this museum and its scary inhabitants and bury myself in the colors, strokes, and lines.\n\nIt turned out that I would escape the museum in another way. After a mere three seconds of staring at the painting this way, my senses started picking up things that couldn't have been there. If they were, then I would have been impossibly transported to a pine forest within the space of a few seconds. \n\nMy ears were picking up the near and distant sounds of animals and the wind rustling through the trees. I could feel this same wind giving me cold kisses on the cheek as well as the muddy ground below my feet. There was also the mud and a previous rainstorm, the smell of which filled my nostrils. The only sense that wasn't picking up the forest was my sight. My eyes were still focused on the surface of that rock. \n\nMy response to these sensations was delayed, but when my mind eventually picked up what was happening, I shut my eyes and let out a loud gasp. Luckily I managed to muffle it with my hand and avoided bringing unwanted attention to myself. \n\nAs soon as I warded off the shock, I realized that in closing my eyes I had transported my other senses back to the museum. I heard that quiet chatter of voices and the clacking of someone's high heels as they walked across the floor. I felt the warmth that the museum's HVAC system was blowing into the room. The smell of someone's flowery perfume and the lemony freshness of the museum cleaning staff's supplies also surrounded me. \n\nI took in these sensations until I found the courage to open my eyes again. I was back in that forest. I closed my eyes again, and I found myself back in the museum. I had to open and close my eyes a few more times to try and convince myself that my senses were experiencing what they were experiencing. \n\nEven after that, I still had trouble convincing myself that the whole situation was real. Some of the facts just didn't add up. Yes, this type of effect did live up to the description that the article had given it, but why wasn't there more? The discovery of a revolutionary effect like this should've caused a pervasive media sensation. \n\nAnd then there were the other people in the gallery. Why weren't they more excited? They should've been smiling, giggling, and/or even shaking with delight at the new sensations. Even if they had experienced such sensations before, they should have still been jabbering loudly with each other and trying to figure out how the whole thing worked. \n\nHow DID it work? What in the world could be the mechanism that caused such a sensation? I theorized that maybe the arrangement of the markings on the rock paintings had created some hypnotic effect. Or maybe there was some kind of beam in the frame of the painting that could transmit these sensory images right into my mind. \n\nUnfortunately, that last guess turned my thoughts into ones of extreme paranoia. If there was a beam that could do that, what else could it do? Could they tell people what to think or erase their memories? Were such beams now hidden in different areas and being used to control the populace? Perhaps, if there was a beam in the frame of this painting, it had already transmitted thoughts that weren't my own into my mind. I shivered at the thought as I moved my eyes over the frame of the painting but failed to spot any noticeable holes.\n\nI glanced over at the other paintings and the walls, trying to see if I could spot any of these strange theoretical mechanisms. I couldn't see anything, but that didn't mean they weren't there. Feeling overwhelmed, I decided to walk over to and sit down on a nearby bench I had spotted. Then I put my hands in my lap, closed my eyes, and performed some light meditation to help myself calm down. \n\nOnce my mind was clear, it pointed out to me that an opportunity may have fallen into my lap. Since I knew Mr. Boone and he knew Cecelia Smith, perhaps he could convince her to give me an apprenticeship. During that, she could teach me how she created those revolutionary paintings and then I could make them myself and be a key part of this new art revolution that the article had predicted was coming. Then I would be just as good if not greater than all of the people here.\n\nWhat would it be like if I returned to this museum after I had achieved this status? Perhaps they would open a gallery that held my works alone. And then they would have a party at the opening. I wouldn't be dressed in thrift store rags and using discount beauty products then. I would instead have a dress like the one I admired in that discount store which was blue and had thousands of sequins that shimmered like glints of sunshine in water. And I would hire the best hair stylist in the city to tie up part of my hair in a braid that even the greatest basket weavers couldn't achieve. And instead of tiptoeing around all the rich people, I'd be talking straight to them because my success would have given me the confidence that I always wanted. \n\nBut wait, would Cecelia Smith even take me on as an apprentice? I had been struggling with getting good grades in Mr. Boone's class because my artwork had been, as he had written, \"too pedestrian\" and I needed to \"be more confident and experimental\" with my artistic ideas. Perhaps Cecelia and Mr. Boone would only stand there laughing at me and saying how terrible I was at art and that it was stupid for me to believe I even had a chance at getting an apprenticeship. And then Cecelia's bodyguards would pick me up and throw me out of the museum. \n\nWait…that wasn't right. What sort of visual artist has bodyguards? Yes, the worse that they could do was laugh at me and put me down. But I knew Mr. Boone and while he could be critical he was never outright mean. I didn't know what Cecelia was like, but Mr. Boone probably wouldn't let her be too mean to me. They'd probably just stare at me awkwardly and make some excuse on why Cecelia couldn't take on an apprentice. \n\nStill, there was the possibility that Cecelia could see something in me that others hadn't. Didn't that make it worth trying, especially because the consequences couldn't be too severe? It seemed that way to me. \n\nI got up and immediately started walking as fast as I could in the direction of the presentation room, where I suspected Cecelia and Mr. Boone would be. Luckily, the lecture was about to begin, so I could just follow along with the wave of people and avoid bumping into anyone or having to dart around them. For a moment, I felt like I was part of an army marching into battle. This made me smile. \n\nWhen I made it to the presentation room, I immediately spotted Mr. Boone and Cecelia Smith on the right side of the theater. I gently made my way through the crowd and called out to Mr. Boone as soon as I got close. This caused him to turn, see me, smile, and wave. In a few moments, I was right next to him. Unfortunately, though, I was so enthusiastic about my plan that I skipped over greeting him and went right over to Cecelia. I said hello to her, introduced myself, stuck out my hand, and looked her in the eyes. \n \nMy anxiety flooded back the instant that Cecelia grabbed my hand. That caused me to shake her hand and look her in the eyes for what was, I assume, a longer time than normal. While I was doing this, much to my shock, my senses were spirited away again. \n\nHowever, the place this time was different and I could take it in with my eyes as well as with my other senses. I was in a room in a seemingly abandoned house somewhere. I could hear a rainstorm outside, smell a musty odor, and see an old wooden floor on which several seemingly random items had been carefully placed. Hovering above this ritual arrangement was a portal. Looking through it, I could see what I somehow knew was the structure of the universe. Through studying this, I just knew I could learn exactly how the universe worked. Then I could manipulate it to my will and make paintings like the ones Cecelia had made. \n\nBefore I could get a full understanding, however, I ended up fainting clean away and missed the lecture. I felt disappointed, but in retrospect, could Cecelia have given me any knowledge that was better than what I had received? \n\nAlso, I probably wouldn't have paid much attention anyways. My new knowledge hijacked most of my attention for the next few months. I did my best to try and forget it and kept telling myself to not do anything about it. I could tell it was dangerous and I swore that I could forge an artistic career of my own without any shortcuts. \n\nYet, it kept coming up in my mind with every bad grade I received and every time I lost inspiration. And no matter how hard I tried, these incidents kept happening. I was soon thinking about what I'd switch my major to and trying to picture a happy future for myself. \n\nHowever, all that I could see was me sitting in an office job in a sundown office building with half the lights gone and several dozen missing ceiling tiles. I'd be wearing a dress covered in holes and stains because I couldn't afford any new clothes. I also wouldn't bother with making my hair and makeup extra pretty or try to start up conversations with my coworkers at the water cooler because I'd be so depressed. \n\nSo you see, I have to gather the ritual items, open the portal, and study the structure of the universe enough to understand how to make the painting, no matter how dangerous it is.  I've been trying to hold back the temptation for as long as I can, but I don't think I will last much longer. I am truly sorry.",

        "text": " \n\nI am writing this in my last moments, with the hope that it will serve as a warning to anyone who may come across this story. I never believed in ghosts or haunted houses, but that all changed when I decided to explore an old abandoned house that I heard rumors about. I had heard stories of it being cursed and that anyone who entered would never return, but I thought it was nothing more than a myth. I was wrong.\n\nThe moment I entered the house, I felt an overwhelming sense of dread. I should have turned back then, but something compelled me to keep going. The house seemed to come to life around me, shifting and changing as I ventured deeper. I soon realized that I was trapped inside, with no way out.\n\nThe darkness inside the house was suffocating, it seemed to have a life of its own, it was as if it was trying to smother me. I heard whispers, screams and moans that seemed to come from all around me, as if the spirits of the house were all around me, watching and waiting. I saw ghostly figures all around me, their eyes were filled with anger and sorrow, it was as if they were trying to communicate something to me, but I couldn't understand what they were trying to say.\n\nAs the night went on, I began to feel a sense of impending doom. It was as if the house was alive and had a malevolent intelligence, it was toying with me, leading me to my death. I remember feeling something cold and evil, following me through the darkness. It was always just out of sight, but I could feel its gaze on me, always watching, waiting. It was as if it was playing a twisted game of cat and mouse with me.\n\nI ventured through the endless corridors, the house seemed to have an endless number of rooms, each one more terrifying than the last. I soon lost track of time and my sense of direction. It was as if the house was shifting and warping around me, making it impossible for me to find my way out.\n\nAs I was wandering, I stumbled upon a room, unlike any I had seen before. It was a large room, with a fireplace in the center, and around the fireplace there were statues of figures that seemed to be in anguish. The room was lit by candles, and the walls were adorned with a strange symbols and arcane inscriptions. The room seemed to radiate an eerie energy, it was as if something was waiting for me.\n\nIn the corner of the room, there was an old leather-bound diary. I couldn't resist the urge to read it, and as I flipped through the pages, a cold realization dawned on me. The diary belonged to the previous owner of the house, who had been driven to madness by the spirits that haunted it. They had tormented him, driving him to the brink of insanity, before finally claiming his soul.\n\nAs I was reading the diary, I could feel the presence of the spirits growing stronger. The whispers and moans turned into screams, and the ghostly figures became more violent. They were angry that I had found the diary, and they were determined to claim me as well.\n\nI knew then that I had to get out of the house, but it was too late. The spirits had sealed all the exits, trapping me inside. I was running out of time and options, the only thing left for me to do was to write this warning, in the hope that it will reach someone before it's too late.\n\nI beg of you, do not make the same mistake I did. Stay away from that cursed house, or you will suffer the same fate as me. The spirits that reside there are not to be trifled with. They are malevolent, powerful, and will stop at nothing to claim your soul. I pray that you heed my warning before it's too late. I can feel the spirits closing in on me, my time is running out. I only hope that this warning will reach someone before it's too late.",

        "text": " Sailors have overactive imaginations. They can’t help it. They’re bored, they’re overworked, and for months at a time, the only view they have is the ocean blue. \n\nBut boredom does make for good legends, and in a way, it turns every sailor into a storyteller. It’s part of the job. \n\nAfter a lifetime of midnight watches there’s no seasoned seaman that hasn’t seen *something* he can’t quite explain. Lights in the distance, orbs in the sky, or strange beasts propelling through the water. \n\nI’ve heard it all and after nine years of sailing, I was still waiting on my story. It came when they all do, 2am, not enough caffeine. I was aboard The Gold Maris, but there was nothing gold about it.\n\nIt was a beat-to-shit bulk-carrier that had seen nearly thirty years of salt water. We were underway, with a load of 35,000 tons of scrap metal we’d picked up in Peru and were taking to China. \n\nIt was September, and a storm that brewed in the Solomon Sea was gathering strength as it headed east, into the South Pacific. It was no hurricane, just a simple tropical storm. But still, waves of thirty-five-feet were reported by passing vessels.\n\nOur crew did what the crews of all junk boats do when they hear that a storm is coming; we got quiet. Real quiet. \n\nAt dinner time, there was nothing but the sound of silverware clinking on plates. No conversation, not so much as a “pass the ketchup.” This is the time we took to reevaluate our lives. Big black letters were written on the white board in the galley. A warning in English and Filipino:\n\nROUGH WEATHER. SECURE ALL ITEMS IN YOUR ROOMS. DO NOT GO ON DECK.\n\nThe “do not go on deck” part was for those looking to have a smoke. Doing deck rounds was part of my job. \n\nI was on the bridge as wheelsman that night and every four hours when I traded shifts, I had to walk the length of the ship to make sure everything was secure for the storm. \n\n2am rolled around and Johnny came to replace me. One of the most redeemable things about work is that it forces you to be friends with people you’d never imagine you’d get along with. Johnny was a Filipino sailor, 62 years-old, in a perpetually good mood, and loved to eat all the best cereal before I could get my hands on it. \n\n“Sup, Johnny.” I said, as he came up the stairs to take watch.\n\n“Hey, man!” Johnny walked carefully, balancing a bowl of cereal in his hands. \n\n“You save me some Cookie Crisp?”\n\n“It’s in the stash. Still about two boxes.”\n\nI groaned in pleasure. I’d recently traded smoking for sweets. “Alright, I gotta do my walk around first.” \n\n“Wow,” said Johnny, turning to face the windows. “Light show.” We stood in silence, watching the violet lighting in the distance strike the sea. “Beautiful.” \n\n“I better go before it starts pouring.” I threw on my orange rain jacket and went out the starboard door to the deck. The warm Pacific wind was my favorite part of doing these routes. Peru to China is four boring weeks but that tropical breeze was my balm. \n\nBut now the wind was icy. At least to my summer skin it was. I bunched my shoulders up against the cold. “Fuck, fucking, fuck.” I’d fully embraced sailor as my second language, and I muttered more curses as I walked down the metal stairs. \n\nI was supposed to check on a few things. The Jacobs ladder, the midships depth reader, and I had to make sure the clamps on all the cargo doors were secure. \n\nIt was hard to keep my attention on anything but the flash of lightning. The world would illuminate purple and I’d pause, a little stunned by how there still wasn’t so much as a rumble on the wind. The only sound was the ever-present hum of the diesel engines. \n\nThe hatches were secure; they always were. The depth reader was all chained up and the Jacob’s ladder could’ve used another knot to secure it to the railing, but the second I bent to fix it, the sky opened. Pounding, pouring rain. It punched loudly on my waxed hood. \n\nI decided the ladder was good enough and that I was going to get out of this shit and have some cereal. But for some reason I stayed standing at the railing. The sea was finally beginning to look like a storm was coming. The wind blew the rain harder and horizontal, but I didn’t shield my eyes. I widened them in horror.\n\nI could only see it when the lightening flashed, but that was plenty enough. There was something beneath the waves. A great moving mass. It was about a hundred yards off the port-side railing and traveling at the same speed of the ship. \n\nI kept staring at it, expecting it to disappear or suddenly make sense. But the longer I looked, the more disturbed I became. I blinked, wiped my face, did every one of those clichés that those who can’t believe their eyes do. \n\nIt was too big to be a whale at several hundred feet long. Not to mention it was moving too fast, its speed too steady. \n\nThere was a crash of thunder and I dropped my flashlight. It rolled quickly on the slick deck and fell into the ocean, vanishing the moment it hit the water. \n\nI stumbled and started running back to the bridge. I raced up the stairs and threw open the door to the pilothouse. “Johnny! Johnny, you gotta come see this. I need to know if I’m losing my mind or not.” \n\n“What is it?”\n\n“There’s something in the water.” \n\nHe raised his brow and stood. It was against the rules to leave the pilothouse empty while we were underway, but our captain wasn’t big on maritime rules nor was there much to worry about hitting. Even if we spotted a rogue wave it wasn’t like there’d be enough time to steer our slow, clunky ship so the wave didn’t roll us. \n\n“Ok, I’ll come see. But quickly.”\n\nThe two of us clomped down the metal staircase and practically jogged down the deck. “There!” The dark mass was just where I had last seen it. Johnny squinted. He was older and with his wet glasses, I realized he might not be able to see much past the railing. \n\nI turned to look at him, expecting to see a smile that said what a fool. Instead, the color had left his face. He stared slack-jawed into the water. \n\n“Johnny?!” The rain was coming down so hard I had to yell and the length between lightning strikes was getting longer. \n\n“Itim Pating.” Johnny whispered, with his eyes still fixed on the water. \n\n“What?!” I didn’t often see him without a grin. I bounced on my toes, cold and anxious. \n\n“Black shark.” \n\n“What’s that?”\n\nSuddenly, Johnny extended his finger, suggesting I follow his gaze. I looked back to the water to see the black shadow was slowing. It was going to be behind the ship soon. \n\n“We have to go,” said Johnny. \n\n“Go?!” I shouted. “The fuck does that mean? Go where?” \n\nJohnny didn’t answer, he started speed-walking back toward the pilothouse. “We need to disable the radar. The radio.” He shouted. \n\nThen something hit the ship. It struck the bow and the whole ship lurched. We both fell and it wasn’t until I felt my stomach drop from a lack of gravity that I realized we’d hit a wave. A giant one. The ship was pointed down now, we were in a racing descent into the trough of the wave. Johnny and I rolled down the deck. I was able to grab onto the railing, but Johnny kept tumbling. \n\nThe ship leveled out at the bottom of the wave and I suddenly didn’t have to hold on for dear life, but there’d be waves just like it. \n\n“Johnny!” I shouted. I’d lost track of him. I heard a distant murmur and then I saw him. The Jacob’s ladder had unfurled overboard. It was still attached to the railing and Johnny clung to a rung as the ladder dangled against the side of the ship.\n\nI ran to where he was. “Hey!” I dropped to my stomach and reached my hand down, but he didn’t react. If another wave hit now, I was a dead man. I wasn’t bracing myself or anything. I just wanted to save Johnny. \n\nHis glasses were bent and broken on his face. The lens from one had shattered against his cheek and blood streaked down to drip off his chin.  \n\n“Come on. Give me your hand.” He was reluctant but he gave in. I pulled him back up and over the railing, but he immediately fell clutching his leg. “Ah!” He screamed in pain.   \n \n\n“What?! What is it?” \n\n“My leg, I think it’s broken.” \n\n“If we wait for a stretcher, we die.” \n\nJohnny bit his lip and nodded. I threw my arm across his shoulders and we hobbled our way back to the bridge. \n\nThe wave was big enough to warrant a muster alarm. The entire crew was gathering in the galley to assess potential damage to the ship and themselves. Me and a couple of the engineers took Johnny the rest of the way to his room. We laid him on his bed and did our best to keep his leg braced but this was a junk boat. Even if we were carrying a load of gold our parent company still wouldn’t pay to have a doctor aboard. \n\nWe applied basic first aid in the form of a pint of brandy. \n\nI stayed by Johnny’s side while one of the engineers went back to their duties. Thomas stayed. He was my second favorite person on the ship behind Johnny. We were both from the Midwest and bonded over being landlocked sailors. He was a good kid, kind to everyone and the youngest on board at 22 years old. Maritime was an aging profession, and it was lucky to have a young bright boy in Thomas.  \n\nMost of the crew came to check on Johnny over the next hour, but when the weather got rougher everyone stayed in their rooms. After Thomas left, too, we were quiet for several minutes. I sat on a milkcrate next to his bed and clung to steam pipe to keep from sliding across the floor as we were tossed by the sea. \n\nThe adrenaline rush from the wave and Johnny’s injury almost made me forget about what we’d seen in the water. I give him another sip of brandy and then spoke. “Now are you going to tell me what the hell that was out there?”\n\nJohnny stared at the ceiling for a moment. “There was a ship 20 years ago. It was a traveling a route similar to ours. It went down in a storm, supposedly. But the last message it’s captain ever sent out was that they were being followed. When he was asked by what, he said was itim pating, black shark. Something dark, just beneath the surface, hundreds of feet long was watching them. Waiting.”\n\nI had heard so many legends of strange things at sea I couldn’t exactly remember if I had heard of this before, but it sounded familiar. “Those are just stories, Johnny.”  \n\nHe shook his head slowly, almost sadly. “I had a cousin who was on permanent route pretty much the same as that one. Not too different from ours now. Chile to China. Loading copper and coming back for more every month. One day, there’s a storm approaching and from the stern deck the whole crew gathered to watch this thing that followed them in the distance. He wasn’t a superstitious guy. He joked about it to his wife on a satellite call. He said it was the Black Shark. That was the last contact anyone had with a crew member of that ship.”\n\n“It sunk?”\n\n“A three-year-old Panamax. A brand-new ship, and it sinks in a little cyclone. Every ship that’s ever seen the Black Shark, that has had crew that actually reported it, has sunk just days later.”\n\nI had to brace myself and Johnny’s trash can went racing across the floor as a wave tilted us sideways. “Except for one.” \n\nThe lights suddenly turned off and the weak yellow glow of the emergency bulbs took their place. I felt my heart racing in my chest. Every ten seconds a wave would boom against the bow and its echo would ring through the entire ship. I pictured that thing out there, just beneath the surface, preparing to sink us to the bottom of the sea. \n\n“What did they do? How’d they get away?”\n\n“It was a fishing vessel, but no small ship. 250 feet long, 10,000 tons of storage. A beast for its class. One day, they saw the Black Shark and there wasn’t a single non-believing man on that boat. They knew legends and they thought they were dead men, so they did what they could to try and save themselves. \n\nThey destroyed their radar, their radio. They threw their EPIRB overboard and even set the lifeboat loose as a diversion so the Black Shark would think they were in it. They sailed as a ghost ship for two weeks before reaching port, but they reached land, alive.”\n\n“So, I’d need to commit international felonies to save us? I’d go to prison even if we made it to port in one piece.” \n\n“I know. But it’s worth a try, otherwise this metal piece of shit will be our tomb.” The word “tomb” coincided with a massive wave that threw me against the wall. Johnny grimaced as he braced himself in bed. “And of course,” he caught he breath and continued. “The lights are off. They might not even catch you.”\n\nI tapped my foot anxiously. “This *thing*, it sinks ships, but why? What’s the reason? Are there any legends that answers that?”\n\nJohnny pursed his lips and swallowed. “Well... yes. All the sightings have been near here. The South Pacific and not all that far from Point Nemo.” \n\nIf you haven’t heard of it, Point Nemo is the furthest place you can be from dry land on planet earth. 1670 miles until land-ho. The exact location sits somewhere in the southwestern Pacific, although there’s no actual marker. \n\nThere are no shipping routes nearby and there sure as shit isn’t any fishing. \n\nIf you’re there, it’s just you and the ocean blue. Or so sailors have always thought…\n\n“Why Point Nemo?” \n\n“It brings the boats there and once the sailors are drowned… They come back. There’s been reports of sailors lost at sea returning to their home ports. But something has taken them over. Like a creature, using their bodies as a human host.”\n\nScary stories are told at campfires because of the frightful setting—woods, darkness, sleeping with a thin layer of plastic between you and the world—it all amplifies the terror. But here, in this doomed boat, a thousand miles from anything, Johnny’s story hit a nerve a campfire tale couldn’t hope to touch. I was beginning to sweat with nervous fear. \n\nI got up to leave, and Johnny took my hand. “Do what you think is best but make up your mind. We don’t have much time.”\n\nI left his room and stood in the dark hall. I wasn’t scheduled for a watch shift in the pilothouse until the afternoon and by then the captain would be there too, surveying our passage through the storm. I needed to destroy the radio in there, but there were other things on Johnny’s list I could do, but I needed to act quick. \n\nI went to the windlass room where we kept our cold weather and rain gear and swapped rain jackets. The crew would recognize me in my orange coat, but in the forest green one I donned I’d be invisible in the dark and the rain. Before I left, I paused. Sitting above a coil of hose was a fire axe. I snatched it and made my way outside. \n\nI raced up the outside stairs that ran up the side of the bridge. It was slow going, from the waves and the wind I was being tossed back and forth against the railings. When I got to the landing that faced the windows to the pilothouse, I could see the captain and 2nd mate inside. I ducked quickly but realized I didn’t have to; with how hard it was raining they probably couldn’t see anything outside.  \n\nThe emergency positioning device was secured by our life vessel. The EPIRB was meant to be taken if we abandoned ship so rescuers would know where to find us. \n\nOur lifeboat was not an inflatable raft, nor an oar boat. It was a large cylinder that launched from a slide on the stern of the ship. I took the EPIRB off the wall and hurled it into the ocean.\n\nThen I devised a plan. Disabling the radar, radio, and lifeboat would all alert attention. But I’d start with the radar. When they came out of the pilothouse to look at the dish, I’d smash the radio inside and when they were busy wondering what the hell happened to the radio, I’d launch the lifeboat. \n\nSimple enough. I climbed the ladder to the very top of the bridge. The radar dish was sturdy, but the fire ax was sturdier. I quickly severed it from its stand. I double-timed it down the ladder. Without radar, we were dead in the water, and both the captain and 2nd mate burst out of the pilothouse to inspect what was going. I took the opportunity to sneak inside, and with just a dozen swings of the ax, I made the entire bridge of the ship useless. \n\nSparks shot up from the control panels and the cheap radio exploded into a million pieces. Now, I just had the lifeboat. \n\nDown the steps, around the bend and I was there. I lifted the ax above my head. Instead of undoing the ropes and pulling the cord I was just going to cut it. But something caught my eye before I swung; Thomas was staring at me in horror. \n\n“Jake, is that you?”\n\nI brought the ax down, gently. Thomas was halfway out the stern door that led towards the cabins. He held one of the ship’s satellite phones in his hand. I frowned at him and for some reason he acted like he was the guilty one. \n\n“I know it looks hopeless and it is,” he gestured at the sat phone. “I was just trying to get reception out here to call my dad, this storm has me a little spooked.” He came to his senses and pointed at me. “But what’re you doing with that thing?” \n\nWe both looked up as we heard shouting coming from outside the pilothouse, suddenly, an alarm began to blare. \n\n“Thomas, there’s no time to explain. But if I don’t deploy the lifeboat, we could all die.”\n\nHe took a step toward me. “Jake, that doesn’t make any sense.”\n\n“That’s why I said I have no time to explain!” People were moving around now, and any second someone would spot me with the ax. I was sure to be bound and gagged by the crew. \n\n“Let me do this!” I hefted the ax up again to slice the rope but flinched as Thomas lunged at me. \n\n“We could need the lifeboat, Jake! What the hell are you doing?!” He grunted as he wrestled over the ax. I swept his legs out from under him and he hit the deck hard. “Thomas, listen—”\n\nBut suddenly he opened his mouth to scream. I didn’t know what I was doing, a part of my brain thought it would just shut him up, that’s all. The ax slid from my hands toward his mouth. \n\nI didn’t think it would be a fatal blow, but fire axes are razor sharp and weighted. The blade sliced through his face like butter and dinged against the deck. \n\nThomas was still looking at me, the ax head sticking out where his mouth should be. I still can’t unsee it. I turned away and tossed the ax overboard, when I looked back to Thomas I leaned over the railing and vomited. Thankfully the life had already left his eyes. The blade must’ve gone all the way to his spinal cord. \n\nI had to get rid of his body. The rain would wash away the blood and luckily, he was light. I scooped him in my arms and with a gentle toss his body cleared the rail. With the rain and the wind, I didn’t even hear the splash. \n\nI ducked back into the bridge before I could be seen. \n\nI lost the green raincoat and put on my regular one and went to the galley where the rest of the crew was gathering in alarm. Luckily, I wasn’t the last man there and suspicion for the sabotage would likely fall on whatever poor soul was late. \n\nWe were still missing some crew when the captain and 2nd mate came storming in. The crew all straightened up when they realized our stocky captain was leveling a pistol in front of his belly. \n\n“Someone’s sabotaged the ship.” He walked slowly, his boots echoing on the linoleum. “Now, we’ll be doing rollcall—”\n\n“Captain!” Every head spun to the look at the speaker. It was Louis, the 2nd cook. “It might have something to do with what’s been following us off the port side for the last two days…” \n\nThe crew began to mutter. “Quiet!” said the captain. “What’re you talking about?” \n\nBeads of sweat appeared on Louis’s upper lip and brow, it looked like he was trying not to tremble. “I didn’t want to scare everyone. I didn’t want to believe it. But on watch, I saw an object, dark and giant cruising beneath the water.”\n\nI heard some men mutter, “Black Shark.” Some stared ahead in horror while other’s squinted, confused.\n\n“Itim pating?” said the captain with a laugh. “What’s that have to do with someone destroying the fucking bridge?! We’re dead in the water. We have no bearing but a compass. Do you not get that?!” He thundered at the room. “Now, who are we missing?” \n\nThe crew looked at each other. “Thomas,” said the chief engineer suddenly. “We’re missing Thomas.” \n\nHearing his name made my stomach drop. *What have I done?*\n\nThe captain pointed. “Go check his room. In the meantime, we’re going to see about those legends, Louis.” \n\nI watched Louis gulp nervously and we followed the captain, shuffling out towards the stern deck as silent as a funeral procession. \n\nOutside, the rain was still pounding down. “Fire up the spotlights!” shouted the captain. A few crew members went forward to the deck lights that were attached to the stern railing. They cranked them to full blast and began sweeping the beams of light across the sea. \n\nThirty seconds passed in silence as they searched. Then a minute. “It’s too dark! The water’s too rough to see, sir!” \n\nThe captain looked towards the eastern horizon. “Then we’ll wait until dawn.” The crew started making their way back inside, but the captain shouted. “Out here!” \n\nFor the next hour we stood silent in the pouring rain. We were freezing and soaked, tired as all hell but we had to keep our bodies flexed and alert to keep from toppling over when we were rocked by waves. \n\nIt felt like an eternity until the sun rose behind the storm clouds. The water went from black to gunmetal grey and we could see more by the minute. \n\nSuddenly, one of the men on the spotlights raised his arm in a point. He didn’t shout or call out. We were still silent, jostling over one another to see what he was pointing to. \n\nThere, not far off the port side was a long black shadow, just like I had seen earlier in the night. \n\n“What the hell is that?” \n\n“Shh,” said the captain as he went to the railing. We watched it for several minutes, no one daring to speak. It was like the first time I saw it; we were hoping the shadow under the waves would suddenly make sense, or simply disappear. But we had so luck, in fact we gasped as the mass began to breach. \n\n“It’s coming up,” said Louis. “Oh my god, it’s coming up.”\n\nIt broke the surface of the water and white suds splashed off its sides as it came to rest. \n\nThe crew started smiling and laughing. I found myself jeering too. The black mass was a submarine, at least it looked like one. All this time our minds were on sea monsters and aliens. But this appeared to be man-made, but only for a moment. \n\nWe got quiet again as we noticed it was missing a bridge. The classic fin that juts up on the top of every submarine was missing. It was one complete tube with no markings. No ship numbers. Nothing. \n\nThen we flinched back as we saw its black steel shimmer. Something was wrong. It wasn’t like any submarine I’d ever seen. The crew started to shout in fear and in the commotion, I grabbed Louis and whispered close.\n\n“Louis, it was me. I destroyed the bridge and launched the lifeboat. Johnny told me the story of the only ship that got away from this thing. It’s done. I already did all we could.”\n\nLouis stared up at me in disbelief. “You did what?!”\n\n“The fishing vessel, maybe you haven’t heard of it, but a ship once got away from the Black Shark. They destroyed their radar. They went dark.”\n\n“No,” Louis swatted my hand off him. “You fucking idiot. The only crew to ever escape from the Black Shark abandoned ship in the life raft and radioed the U.S. military. You… you killed us. We’re dead in the water. Who told you to destroy this ship?”\n\nI didn’t answer him. I turned and started running toward Johnny’s room. I flung open his door and at first, I didn’t think he was on his bed. It was looked empty.\n\nBut as I approached, I noticed a stench. Organic iron; blood. And there on the bed was Johnny, but he was…empty. There was nothing left but his skin, and his back was a gory mess, something had burst out of him and left his flesh grotesque and deflated. His eyelids and cheeks were empty like a Halloween mask. It was as if something had been wearing him as a human suit. \n\nThen his words came back to me. He’d been telling me the truth about the Black Shark. How sailors that it killed come back with something living inside them. Human hosts, he had said. And he was one of them. I had listened to his lies about disabling the ship, launching the lifeboat and now, we were doomed. \n\nI’m sending this message out in hopes a satellite can pick it up. There’s a chance that one comes in range for a brief time. Just long enough for my story to be sent out from this damned ship. \n\nWhen I walked back to the stern deck, most the crew were still there. The submarine however, had gone beneath the waves again. \n\nThe captain swung a compass. “We’re back tracking,” he said. “The ship can’t be steered and we’re heading southeast.” But I didn’t need to hear his reading to know exactly where we were going. \n\nWe were headed right toward [Point Nemo.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)",

        "text": "I know most people find it disturbing, but someone has to do it.\n\nI collect dead bodies. It's something I do every day, and it almost never changes. My colleague gets to the scene first, to do all the prep work. I turn up a while later to transport them where they need to be. Not many people know about what I do, but my lack of conversation about it is not out of shame. I am proud of it, and I simply don't want people to view me any differently.\n\nUsually, everything goes smoothly. I turn up, the body is already concealed in a bag, and I load it into the vehicle. The whole drive is just me and a body in the back, and maybe my colleague on some days. But yesterday, the drive did not go as it should. The events that transpired mean I will live in fear for the rest of my days, and may have to give this up.\n\nI turned up to the scene. It was a fairly large house on the outskirts of town. A guy that lived alone, and never really spoke to anyone. My colleague had probably been the first person to step foot in that house, besides the man himself, in years. I myself, probably the second.\n\nThe door had been left unlocked, and I went inside the building. My colleague never leaves the body out in the open, for obvious reasons. Even if the death was outdoors, the body is moved indoors. Sure enough, as usual, a large blue bag full of bumps made the faint outline of a human. It takes a bit of effort to move it into the van, but no more than a few minutes. Picking up a limp, lifeless body is second nature to me. I've been doing it for years.\n\nI got the bag down in the back of the van and drove off. It was dark out, and the roads were empty. This is how I like to drive. I made my way to the opposite end of town.\n\n5 minutes into the journey, I heard a groan from behind me. A raspy, shakey, agonized groan. It was loud and sharp, piercing through the sounds of the night. The fear that shot through me is indescribable. I felt a pit open in my stomach, as every muscle in my body tightened. My hands jolted so hard that I nearly crashed, but I kept control.\n\nThe back of the van is too dark to see into, so I grabbed my flashlight from under my chair, and pulled the vehicle to a complete stop. As I shone it into the back, I saw something I had secretly always feared - The bag was sat upright.\n\nI crept closer, trying to be silent. A muffled voice from within the bag spoke, \"Hello? Who's there? I can hear you!\"\n\nI wasn't sure what to do. My colleague always checks their pulse. Had he made a mistake? He must have.\n\nI slowly unzipped the bag, as the man inside began to scream. We stared at each other, both of our eyes showing the terror within us. His cries echoed beyond the walls of the van, out into the darkness. I wanted to join him and cry myself, as I knew what this meant, but I held it back.\n\nIn a blind panic, I took my flashlight and struck the man on the head. I know that's unprofessional, as I didn't want to damage his skull, but it was my first instinct.\n\nIt didn't kill him, though. It didn't even knock him out. He fought me, and I wasn't strong enough. He just kept screaming \"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID!\". Why couldn't he be like the rest?\n\nI'm ashamed to admit, he got out. He opened the back doors of the van and got out. He was smart about it, too. He climbed over fences so I could only follow him on foot, to stop me from driving after him. After just 5 minutes, he was far enough ahead that I could no longer hear him, and after 10 more minutes, I knew I had lost him completely.\n\nI phoned up my colleague and told him. We were furious at each other, yet upset with ourselves. How had we both messed up? In my opinion, he's more at fault than me. He usually strangles them properly, how had he messed this one up?\n\nThe flashlight to head, even if it had worked, would have still ruined the skull. Strangling is the only way that leaves the body in pristine condition. The way I like it.\n\nI didn't get to add this body to my collection. And for fear of being caught, I may have to stop my hobby of collecting corpses entirely.",

        "text": "  \n\nFriday the Thirteenth. January. 2023. Every year I think they can’t make glasses out of the incoming year. And every year I’m proven wrong. \n\nWe will be three years removed from one of the most devastating, soul-crushing, life-changing events in human history. Feels like it’s getting back to what once was, and what will ever be.\n\n7-11. Approximately 12 miles from destination.\n\n*Ding.*\n\nThe fluorescent light gives off an intimidating aura. No matter. Spirits are high, friends are waiting, and Takis are sitting on a shelf, to be destroyed. \n\n“Z, grab some dip too,” Shell says as we split up after entering the store. Her name is Michelle, but we’ve all called her Shell for as long as I can remember. \n\nI put a thumbs up as I walked down the aisle, hoping she’d see it. I was on a mission, and we could not waste precious time talking. We only had an hour before the party started. As my friends and I referred to Michelle as “Shell,” she, and the rest, referred to me as “Z.” My actual name is December. I know, I know. You probably don’t know too many Decembers. Besides the month. As a child though, I was the most active. Involved in everything from dance, volleyball, ballet, chess, drama, and competitive drinking (in my college years.)\n\nI can’t remember exactly how the joke started, but I was referred to as having “Zazz.” I can’t disagree. So, my friends shortened it to “Z,” for short. And it stuck. \n\nMy duty had been fulfilled, Takis, dip, and some more drinks. I meet Shell at about the same time, right at the counter. She had retrieved her part. Mission successful. \n\nI gave the clerk a closed mouth smile, exchanged pleasantries, and reached into my back pocket, retrieving my debit card. \n\n“Where you ladies headed, little girls’ night out in the city?” The 711 employee spoke. The smell of stale cigarettes became even stronger when her mouth opened. Gnarly yellow teeth and those off-putting stress lines surrounded her lips. Don’t get me wrong, she seemed very nice, but a little strange.\n\nI looked at Shell briefly, before returning my attention to the clerk, who’s name tag said “Die.” I shook my head, cleared my eyes. “Diane.” Ok, that was weird.\n\nI once again put that stressful closed mouth smile on. “Oh, he he no, well yes, well. Ok, take a deep breath Z. We ARE going to a party, but no, not in the city. “Yes, we’re going out, actually only a few miles away from here. We were both so happy to see a convenience store around. Thought it was all country out here.”\n\nAnd with that, I started to pay for our food and prepared to say goodbye forever to this 711 and “Diane.” As she asked me if I wanted a receipt, I started to shake my head no.\n\n“So where are you going?” she asked, head down, looking at the receipt printer. It took me a second. Kind of rude to just pry into my personal life. Again, I looked at Shell. Her face said, “I don’t know, grab your receipt, or don’t, and let’s go.” For some reason I told her.\n\n“Umm..” I stumbled. “Well, we’re going to a friends house.” As I was speaking, I decided it probably wasn’t a good idea to say exactly where we were going. Not like she was going to follow us or anything, but why take that chance.\n\n“It’s just a place in the woods, Miss. You actually have to go by the old Mill to get there.”\n\nThis ladies’ eyes widened slightly. I swear I could see a glossy sheen coat them. Along with a slight shake.   \n “If you’re going to drive by the mill.. flash your lights. As many times as you can, before you pass it.”\n\nShell accidentally let out a snort, and then quickly covered her mouth with both hands. I knew it was accidental when I saw her eyes.  \n\nI gave her a look that said, “please don’t make this weird, lets just get out of here.” \n\nI kindly smiled at the clerk. I grabbed our purchases, while Shell was still holding her face and looking dumb. I gave her a slight push, meeting her eyes with mine. Eyebrows raised, as if to say “get to it.” Shell understood without saying anything and grabbed one of the bags. I reached for the remaining items on the counter, but before I could, a sinewy white hand grabbed my wrist with such force, it sent pain waves through my arm. I let out an automatic “HEY,” before being pulled down toward the counter. I was yanked down with such force that my chin almost struck it. I raised my eyes, now staring directly at Diane. She lowered herself behind her side of the counter to meet my eyeline. \n\n“I’m trying to help you,” this psycho said.\n\n“Get off of-,” I tried spitting out before this apparent she-hulk in hiding wretched my wrist even harder.\n\n“Flash… your… lights. When you get close… flash your lights before you get to the Mill.” And with that, she released her grip. I instinctively moved backward, getting away from this freak while also grabbing my wrist. That really, really hurt. I looked at Shell. Who knows what that whole thing just looked like to her.\n\n“Let’s go,” I motioned toward the door. Shell didn’t say a word.\n\nAs we entered our vehicle, she finally opened her mouth, laughing in a sarcastic, yet realistic manner. After what I just went through, I couldn’t tell if she was laughing out of nervousness or what.  I could tell she was freaked out, as I was. After a few seconds I joined her in releasing a few cathartic laughs. \n\n“Holy shit Z, I’m sorry. Are you ok?” I took a moment. I looked at my wrist, red, but not broken or anything. I looked back at the 711. I didn’t see anyone behind the counter. I didn’t wait to see if psycho berry would come back.\n\n“I’m fine. Throw the stuff in the back, we only have a few minutes’ drive to the party.”\n\nApproaching the Old Mill. Approximately 4 minutes from destination.\n\nThe car ride from our “twilight zone,” appearance at the 711 has been silent. Shell mainly swiped up and down and left to right on her phone. I put SiriusXM channel 9 on. After nothing but silence, Shell almost blew my eardrums off.\n\n“SHIT, Z! The Mill?! Did we pass it yet?”  \n “First off… ow,” as I rubbed my right ear sarcastically. “And no, we are close though, maybe a mile. The sign said the historic mill is coming up about 1 mile. That was about a mile ago.”\n\nShell’s eyes popped. “DUDE! Start flashing the lights!! Didn’t you hear what Die said?”   \n I laughed, not meaning to look at my still throbbing wrist. “I’m not going to take part in some country urban legend. You.. don’t believe that do you?” I looked at Shell with that last part. She wasn’t laughing. She wasn’t smiling. I couldn’t see one centimeter of white, her lips were closed too tight.\n\n“Oh, here you go,” I said. “It’s the star of the night.” An old white building, presumably built around the early 1800’s was approaching on our right. Although it had been dark for some time (it is January, after all,) The old mill was eerily visible. Maybe it was the white paint being illuminated by the moon. Which was itself eerily full. I hope it’s not a full moon on top of all this tonight. The “mill,” part was a dark, evil circle pasted against the all-white ancient building. Where it used to churn, brining 100’s of 1000’s, perhaps millions, of gallons of water into the mill to help make.. whatever they made back then. Or perhaps it was just to create electricity. \n\nI shook my head. I realized I had kind of daydreamed in that half second upon seeing the mill. I looked at Shell. She was still waiting for an answer on flashing the lights.\n\n“Here’s flashing my lights,” I said. With that I slowly extended my right arm. My left arm remained on the steering wheel. I closed my fist. As I gave a sly peak to Shell, my middle finger extended. Flipping the bird immediately broke the tension. Shell snorted, buried her head in her lap, then sat back, flipping her hair behind her. She extended both arms, and both middle fingers along with me.\n\n“Oh, nice, always showing me u-“\n\n“What’s wrong?” Shell said, I was just follow-\n\n“Shh.” “A truck is coming up behind us.” I said quietly. Now all middle fingers were securely placed back in their holsters.\n\n“So.. either let them pass or speed up,” Shell said with her trademark optimism.\n\n“Have you seen any other cars on the road tonight? I haven’t. Just weird that’s all.” I diverted my focus from the road ahead of me, to the rear view, road ahead, rear view. I was hoping our destination was close, but the GPS just happened to lose signal. Not uncommon around here, but..\n\n“He’s throwing his high beams on,” I said. Shell looked in her side mirror to confirm.   \n “Ohh… no… this isn’t..” She couldn’t continue her statement. \n\nThe truck was now within a car length. Lights aggressively going from on to off, to brights, to off, and back on again. And then the horn started. I was immediately struck by some kind of “Texas Chainsaw,” vibe for some reason.\n\nFor whatever reason, I sped up. The truck kept pace. Shell was freaking out. I was freaking out.\n\n“Dude, just pull over, let him go!” She pleaded with me. Again, for some reason I felt safer just moving forward. No doubt we missed our destination. I didn’t care. \n\nBANG\n\n“Holy shit, he hit us!” Shell screamed.   \n “Yea, I’m aware, babe.” I said. Internally screaming but trying to save us from this absolute nutbag. Who knows what their intentions are. I hit the gas again, and again the truck followed suit. The brights were flashing so fast it seemed like a human could not be capable of doing that manually. Shell started crying. I literally put the accelerator to the floor. It didn’t do much. The vehicle behind us was going to rear end us again, and this time it won’t be so gentle.\n\n…. Except it didn’t. All at once, the headlights following us became smaller.. and smaller. It had stopped and reversed. Quickly. Not knowing what in the hell to make of this, I violently pulled over, mashing the break with both feet. We skidded to a dangerous stop on the side of the road.\n\nI looked at Shell, dust and dirt followed the car at our sudden stop.  \n “Do.. do you think this is because we didn’t flash ou-“\n\n*Destination Arrived*\n\nShell and I both looked at my phone stuck to the dashboard. \n\nI looked outside. Sure enough. This was the party we had both been invited to. I think the other girls were invited too. Come to think of it, I forgot exactly who is hosting, just wanted to get out for the night. \n\n“Well… I guess we should just… go in then, yeah?” Shell said, with absolutely no confidence.   \n “Look,” I said. I grabbed an item from the back. “I’ll admit, that was all pretty freaking weird. But I’m not gonna let that ruin this. You with me, old girl?” I smiled at Shell, and it seemed to work. She smiled back. \n\nI pulled a seltzer off of one of the six packs we grabbed and ripped the tab off of the top. Clear sticky alcohol exploded onto both of us. When the moment cleared.. we both started dying laughing. \n\n“The uh.. reckless driving… probably shook these up a bit,” I said. And that just got us rolling again.\n\nWe made our way toward the front door. Totally normal looking house. Cars scattered about the lawn and driveway. Back to normal. Wishful thinking.\n\nThe door was open. Wide open. Only a faint yellow glow emanated from what looked like the dining room, about 20 or so feet away.\n\nI looked at Shell. “What do you think this is, some kind of joke?” She said. “I kind of hear music… don’t you?” I stopped for a second, putting my arm out to also halt Shell. We both put our heads down, concentrating.\n\nRIIIIIIIIIIIIING\n\nWe both jumped, now grasping each other without knowing. I’m surprised our skin is intact.   \n “Did you hear a phone?” I asked. She nodded. There was no follow up ring. As soon as we both moved…\n\nRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING\n\nOk, what the.. \n\n“You should have just done it.” \n\nA whisper from behind us almost knocked us both to the ground in fear. Quickly turning around, we saw nothing. \n\n“Ok, I’ve seen enough horror stories to know when to get the F out,” I said. “Where are all the people, there’s like 20 cars outside,” Shell added.  \n “Who cares, I don’t want to find out the answer.” With that, I dropped the 711 bag, as did Shell. I grabbed her hand and started back toward the front door, which was now shut. I don’t remember either of us shutting it.\n\nSomething was written on the door. In red. A sickening feeling painted my entire body.  \n “Do.. do.. do you see that?” Shell said with a shaky voice.\n\nI indeed saw it. Not wanting to admit it, we moved forward until the letters were readable. In big letters, spraypainted red, hopefully spray paint, was the following:\n\n“You should have just followed the one rule… Happy Friday the 13th…”\n\nAnd that’s when we noped the heck out. This is what I can remember from pure memory, I’m sure it was even worse. So, if you get invited to a shady party in the middle of the woods… maybe consider not going. Or, at the very least, flash your lights when you drive by the mill.",

        "text": "I have always been very fascinated by paranormal events and very interested in them. I have tried in my life already most different rituals for spirit conjurations and the same. But nothing really worked until a few months ago. I drift around a lot on the Internet and look for the most diverse things. Then about 4 months ago I came across the so-called \"tape voices\". This is a way to contact spirits via audio tapes. I read up a lot on the subject because I really wanted to try it myself and contact my deceased great-grandmother, whom I never met. \n\nI decided to conduct the tape voice experiment. I got the necessary equipment and a few tapes and began the preparations. I chose a quiet evening, turned off all the lights, and sat down in my room with the tape recorder. I began by asking questions of my late great-grandmother and asked her to record her voice on the tape if she was able. I left the tape running and waited anxiously to see what would happen.\n\nWhen I played the tape later, I was disappointed at first because nothing seemed to be recorded on it. But then I suddenly heard a soft whisper, which I at first thought was imagination. I played the tape again and this time the whisper was more audible. It sounded like a woman's voice and I was sure it was my great-grandmother's voice.\nNeedless to say, I was very excited and decided to make further attempts. \n\nThe next few nights I repeated the experiment and each time it seemed that I had made contact with my great-grandmother. However, I began to feel very tired and had less and less energy. I also found myself sleeping less and less and my appetite decreased. I thought that maybe it was because of the emotional stress that had been taken up by the contact with my deceased great-grandmother.\n\nBut then, suddenly, eerie things began to happen. I started seeing shadows in my room and there was knocking on my door, although no one was there. I also heard voices that I couldn't explain and it seemed like someone was invading my room when I was asleep. I began to feel uncomfortable in my own room and just slept fitfully. I tried to give up my experiments with tape voices, but the eerie events did not stop. I felt that I had awakened something that I could not send back to its world. \n\nI began to investigate and find out what I had done and how I could undo it. I came across many theories about spirit summoning and the effects it can have. Some people said that I had summoned an evil spirit and that I needed to have an exorcism performed to get rid of it. Others said that I simply needed to stop the ritual and separate myself from the tape.\n\nI decided to try the latter method and stopped my experiments with the tape. I took the tape out of my room and stashed it in a box that I hid in my basement. I thought that would be the end of it all. But the eerie events continued. I was still seeing shadows and still hearing voices. It seemed as if what I had conjured up was still there, haunting me.\n\nI was desperate and didn't know what to do anymore. I was afraid to be in my own house and spent most of my time outside. I was also unfocused, had trouble sleeping, and felt like I was being watched. \n\nI decided to seek professional help and spoke with a parapsychologist. He helped me understand what I had done and how to undo it. He explained to me that I had made an unsafe and inexperienced attempt and that I had created an opening for unwanted energy. With his help and support, I finally managed to bring the uncanny events to a stop. I realized that it is important to proceed carefully and with great caution when experimenting with paranomal phenomena. \n\nI learned that sometimes it is better to let some things rest and not try to understand or control them. But I would still like to know what that being was.",

        "text": "I am a detective inspector in London. Earlier, I shared my first paranormal case with you, this time I am going to tell you about an ongoing murder case, which is freaking me out.\n\nMy phone buzzed and I saw the name of my boss on the screen. 'Watts? Get to the Hotel Lion right away, I've got a case for you,' he said.\n\n(For reasons, I am using a different, imaginary name, the Hotel Lion does not exist in London)\n\nI was still groggy, it being 5:30 in the morning, earlier than when I'd normally wake up.\n\nI wondered what my boss was doing at the station that early and I had a feeling that something was off; Nevertheless, I proceeded to get ready so that I could join him.\n\nBy the time I arrived at the spot, the sun was already up. The Hotel Lion glimmered in the morning sun, its tall windows reflecting off the cobblestone streets of central London. Sleek and modern, it stood out among the other grey brick buildings, its shimmering facade a testament to human ambition.\n\nI parked my car at the parking lot, walked into the building and I showed my badge to the receptionist who told me that m colleagues were waiting for me on the third floor.\n\nMy footsteps echoed down the third floor hallway. As I rounded the corner, I noticed that a group of police officers had clustered around the end of the hallway, murmuring among themselves. My supervisor, DCI Brown, spotted me from the crowd and beckoned me over. His face was pinched with worry.\n\n'Come and take a look inside this room, I'm not sure what we're dealing with,' he said.\n\nMy stomach dropped. 'What do you mean? What room?' I asked.\n\nBrown gestured towards the open door to go inside. With a heavy sigh, I followed his instructions and I turned my gaze to the door, feeling a sudden chill race down my spine. 'What am I looking for?' I asked, although I knew the answer before he said it.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was a dead body on the floor. The body had no marks or evidence of struggle around him. The only clue to this mystery was that he had carefully folded up his clothing in one neat pile beside him - as if for some ritual purpose before taking off into the afterlife. His face showed signs of extreme shock as if something inhuman had suddenly possessed itself upon him just moments before passing away from this life forever.\n\nThe air was thick with tension as I carefully surveyed my surroundings -- a single desk lamp illuminated in its corner, vintage furniture aligned against three of the walls, ruffled velvet curtains pulled close to protect from any outsiders viewing inwards... but most notably of all were two mugs with half drunk tea placed on either side of an armchair.\n\n'He registered under a fake ID. Larry Smith and the address he gave doesn't exist, the guys have already checked it.' - Brown added.\n\n'I see. So someone was here beside him? Could have been murdered?' I asked the CSI investigators, my voice raising in confusion.\n\n'Yes and no,' a voice replied from behind me and I stumbled back in surprise. Our medical examiner Susan stepped out of the private bathroom, her eyes wide and her posture tense.\n\n'What do you mean?' I asked.\n\nSusan crouched down to the body.\n\n'Discoloration around the lips, ears and nails. These are the signs of cyanosis, which is a blue discolouration of the skin due to a lack of oxygen. Oh, honey, you must have suffered quite a bit,' she said and adjusted her hair.\n\n'So he was strangled?'\n\n'No because there are no marks or bruises around his neck.'\n\n'Pillows?' My gaze diverted to the bed and I caught sight of a few pillows\n\n'Possibly. But we need to take samples from those pillows to make sure.'\n\nI knew why Susan said that. The bed was immaculate as if nobody had ever slept on it.\n\n'So what the hell was going on here?\n\n'Ask him,' Susan said and I turned around to find a young man in a navy blue uniform standing at the door. The gold buttons that adorned his blazer glinted in the light and he wore a peaked cap with the hotel's emblem stitched onto it.\n\n'I am Richard and I am the one who escorted Mr Morgan to his room,' he said.\n\n'So he was alone?'\n\n'Definitely. Nobody else checked in with him,' he replied.\n\n'Did he have a guest?' I asked.\n\n'That's the weird part. I went to deliver the room service order and opened the door, only to discover absolute darkness. He was seated on the couch in the dimness and commanded me tiredly to set down the tray on the desk. Yet I could swear I heard someone in the restroom. After that, I left in a jiffy.'\n\n'Are you sure he wasn't alone?' I asked.\n\n'Absolutely. There was somebody in the bathroom taking a shower and he was humming a song.'\n\n'You said he?'\n\n'The voice was more like a male than female.'\n\n'How about the CCTV?' I asked, my interest etched into my face.\n\nHe rubbed his chin in thought and nodded. 'Yes, we have cameras on every floor.'\n\nI need every single one of these if I’m going to be able to analyze them properly,” I said, my voice heavy with authority.\n\nI had almost finished up my work in the hotel room, but as I rounded the bed, I caught sight of my reflection in the mirror. A chill ran down my spine as I noticed a figure standing behind me.\n\nHe had on a olive green raincoat, and his face was hidden in shadows. All I could make out were his eyes – they were a bright, piercing blue that seemed to penetrate right through me with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. He seemed to be staring at something, but what?\n\nI jumped back in surprise and fear.\n\n\"You all right, sweetheart?\" Susan asked me.\n\nI realized that nobody else could see it besides me, which terrified me even more.\n\nI had no idea what it was in the mirror but the hairs on my arms stood on end, my skin prickling with the feeling that the thing in the mirror as I realized that the thing might have been coming for me.\n\nI had never seen anything like it before, and I felt a chill run through my body as if someone had walked over my grave. Was this some kind of spirit or demon? Or maybe an illusion created by the hotel's haunted history? I didn't know what to think, but all I wanted at that moment was to get out of there as soon as possible.\n\nI rushed out of the hotel and quickly got into my car. As I turned on the ignition, I glanced back at the mirror. To my horror, I could see the same figure still in the back seat, but he remained silent, not saying a word. I felt a wave of panic wash over me and I turned the mirror away, so I did could not see him anymore.\n\nMy hands were shaking as I drove back to the police station, my mind abuzz with questions and fears. Who or what had I seen in that hotel room? What did it want from me? Was there a connection between it and the missing man? Why had nobody else noticed this figure in the mirror except for me?\n\nI made a mental note to investigate further into this strange occurrence. For now, I would have to study the CCTV footage and hope to find some answers.\n\nI inserted the USB stick into my laptop and started playing the video. On the screen, I could see Rick, the bellboy, and a man in a suit walk into the room. Then Rick left the room and closed the door behind him. An hour later I saw Rick deliver an order to the room, but there was only one dish—despite two people being inside, as he had mentioned. I was confused. Why did he only order one meal if there were two people in there?\n\nAfterwards, I noticed that no one else ever entered the room. I saw people walking around the hallways, but they never went inside. No one exited the room until the morning when cleaners found Rick's body.\n\nI also took the records of the camera at the reception desk. He was a tall figure with a cut on his cheek, and his movements were jerky and anxious like he was trying to hide something. He kept looking over his shoulder as he spoke with the clerk as if someone was coming after him. Other than that, there was nothing else.\n\nI needed to know more about this man but before I started doing my research, I went to the restroom to take a pee. Afterwards, I went to the sink to cleanse my hands. That's when I saw his frame again. His hood was pulled down low, creating a deep darkness that seemed to cover his face. Then there were his two pools of azure blue eyes—so piercing that it seemed he was looking straight through me.\n\nA chill ran up my spine, and my hand instinctively reached for the penknife I kept in my pocket. In a panic, I flung it wildly at the mirror behind me, shattering it into a thousand pieces.\n\nI was standing in the restroom, still frozen in shock from what I had witnessed. I jumped at the sound of DCI Brown's voice behind me. He stood in the doorway, one hand on the doorknob, surprise and confusion on his face.\n\n\"Marsh! What in the world is going on here?”\n\nI stuttered out an explanation. “I-I...just...can’t get over what I saw today, boss.”\n\nHis expression softened and he said in a gentle but firm tone, “You look like shit! You will use some time off when this case is solved. You need it because otherwise, you will go crazy!\"\n\nI could not agree with him more.\n\nIt was then that I realized how truly strange the events of the day were. That figure in the mirror—I could not shake him from my mind. Was he real? A figment of my imagination? I shuddered at the thought and decided to get back to work.\n\nThere was a moment that day when I went to the kitchen and I could see his reflection staring back at me again even on the door of the microwave.\n\nHis hood pulled low and his blue eyes pierced through mine like daggers into my soul. It sent a chill up my spine and left me feeling more unnerved than ever before.\n\nI needed to take a walk.\n\nMy pulse raced as I stumbled out of the station, my gaze darting from window to window. Everywhere I looked, the mysterious figure was staring back. His reflection winked at me from on top of a parked car, then a storefront window, then a glass skyscraper. I felt like a rabbit being chased by an invisible predator, and my steps quickened with every reflection I saw.\n\nI made a beeline for the pub down the street. I was in desperate need of something to take my mind off this case and the strange figure that seemed to haunt me. I ordered my favourite drink—Jim Beam—in a plastic cup of course, which weirded the waiter out a bit. Then I sat down at an empty table in the corner of the room.\n\nThe pub was surprisingly lively and full of people, but it was also calming at the same time. The sound of laughter and chatter filled the air, accompanied by soft music playing in the background. I sipped slowly on my drink, letting its warmth seep through my veins as I watched all around me.\n\nJust as I was about to take my last sip, my phone started ringing. I glanced at the caller ID and saw it was DCI Brown.\n\n'Marsh! Where are you?' His voice sounded urgent over the line.\n\n'I'm at the pub down the street from the station,' I said hesitantly.\n\nHe sighed audibly before saying, “I need you here now. There have been some new developments in this case that we need to discuss urgently. The victim's real name is Kenneth Brackin and he lives on Canvey Island. His fingerprint was already in our database. He was arrested earlier for a minor crime. You might want to look around at his address.”\n\nMy heart sank as I realized this was not going to end anytime soon. With a heavy sigh, I finished my drink and headed back towards the station resolved to solve this case—whatever it may be—once and for all.\n\nI'm in my office now, waiting for the search warrant. I have a foreboding feeling that the truth lies in his home, and my gut tells me it may not be pleasant. Something deeply sinister is waiting for me, I can sense it.",

Hell,you losers don't know how to play with anything besides yourselves*\n\nThe people sitting by, that were close enough to hear what he said to us bursted out in laughter,followed by others that were told what was so funny\n\nCai walked away satisfied ,knowing that he embarrassed us all.A bunch of other popular people were high fiving him as he walked to his \"jock table\"\n\n\nMy friend group decided to end our lunch early and got up to leave the lunch room\n\n\nA popular girl named Maziee (Cheerleader and volleyball player)threw an orange at Josie's face that barely missed her\n\nOnce we were at the exit door,it opened and another person was walking into the room.Only it wasn't a person.It was the mascot of the school\n\nYou see ,Our sports team's  are called the Prospecters, and that's exactly what out mascot is\n\nHe honestly looks alot like the mascot of the NFL team The San Fransisco 49ers.I only know that because I've heard people mention it before\n\nHe has a medium sized beard with a goofy, catroonish smile and a big miner hat with huge eyes as well\n\nOnce he walked in,everyone else in the room cheered when they saw him and he began running around the room and high giving everyone and started dancing \n\nHe was doing  the stupid \"trendy\" dances as well which only made my friends and I leave even quicker than we originally tried to \n\n\nOnce we were out of there ,Kyle berated a sigh of relieve \n\n*God,I can't wait until we graduate in the summer and never deal with this meathead school again*\n\nThe rest of us agreed completely and Josie mentioned how much she wanted to jump Maizee after she tried to hit her with an orange\n\n\nBut she and the rest of us knew that Josie would get all the blame and trouble for it all as the printable was just like most of the school\n\nWe all tried our best to get through the rest of the day ,ignoring the idiots the best we could.\n\nI had my last period with Cai and 3 of his friends and teammates sitting behind me.I felt at least 5 pieces of paper smack thse back of my head during class\n\nAll 4 of them snickered and whispered behind my back as much as possible during class\n\n\nOnce the day was over,I was walking to my car when I noticed him.The school mascot standing only 10 feet away behind my car\n\n\n*What's the big idea?* \n\n I asked him,honestly expecting whoever was in that stupid thing to answer.But he just stood there motionless,staring foward.\n\n\nI had enough of the shit for one day.I rolled my eyes and walked straight up to him and attempted to shove the bastatd\n\n\nBut it was like he was 600 pounds and he didn't even move back.He then grabbed me by the thoat and lifted me into the air with ease.I was shocked\n\nI'm not even a really skinny person either and whoever was inside couldn't have been that big or strong but somehow they managed to do it\n\n\nThe damn mascot just stared into my soul as I gasped for air, at his mercy.I didn't see anyone else in the parking lot as I walked through it either\n\nI was all alone with this crazy person in a costume.As I was about to pass out,I suddenly felt his grip let go of me as I was dropped to the ground\n\nI was gasping for air and when I finally regained myself,\n\nI slowly looked up at the mascot,expecting Cai,or one of Cai's friends or at least another jock.Perhaps a wrestler (due to the persons strength)\n\n To yank the head off and laugh at me as a nearby hiding crowd would show themselves to mock me,expecting several phones out recording it all\n\n\n\nBut no.The mascot offered out a hand down to me to help me up.I hesitatly took his hand and was yanked up easily \n\nWe stared at each other for what felt like forever before he pulled my head near his face and I heard a whisper that sounded inhuman coming from him\n\n\n\n*I hope to see you and your friends at the game tonight.Big playoff game against a big rival.Don't disappoint me Mikey*\n\n\nI stood there frozen in place.No one and I mean NO ONE besides my friends have ever called me Mikey.Why would this person do it?\n\nThe mascot then slowly turned from me and headed back towards the school entrance.I managed to get a hold of myself and get in my car and headed home\n\n\nI felt so uneasy for the rest of the afternoon .I decided against telling my parents what happened as they wouldn't believe me any way\n\n\nI did text Mason about it after a couple of hours and he responded within seconds after I sent it.I expected him to think I was kidding\n\nBut he sent a message which sent a strange feeling throughout my body\n\n\n*That is no ordinary mascot dude.We all have to be at the game tonight.I'll explain later.Be ready to go*\n\nI thought this had to be a prank.Was Mason in on it in order to lose his reputation as a loser? What did he mean by \"not an ordinary mascot?\" I soon found out\n\n\nAfter awhile of convincing  the rest of our friends to go to the game,we all met in front of the football staduim before kickoff\n\nSarah looked to be the most confused and annoyed\n\n\n*I hate sports.Why did you and Mason insist on all of us coming?*\n\nMason and I looked at each other,unsure of how to tell the others as to why we begged them to come.Finally I decided to make something up\n\n\n*Mason and I have a hillarous way of getting back at a few of these socks.But it will happen after the game.Just come enjoy the show*\n\n\nMason looked at me with a bewildered loom on his face but turned on  the act in a heartbeat once he turned to the rest of the group.\n\n*Mike is right.We just knew you guys wouldn't show up unless we kept bugging you.Lets head inside!*\n\nThe other 3 looked amused  and followed behind Mason and I into the staduim.A lot of people there were shocked to see us being there.\n\n\nA few underclassmen laughed at us and threw up there hands and shouted  *Don't shoot*  before running off and howling with laughter \n\n\nI felt someone's foot try to trip me up, followed by snickering as we made our way up the bleachers stairs to find seats\n\n\nOnce the game was about to start,I saw the mascot run onto the field with the cheer squad (with Maizee being the leader)\n\nI could literally feel Josie's blood boiling when she saw Maizee out there,cheering and smiling as if she was a per cent angel\n\n\nMy focus was mainly on the mascot.He was semi mimicking the cheer routine but kept \"messing up\" to bring laughter to the crowd\n\n\nI looked over at Mason and his face was pure white with what appeared to be fear .I honestly was feeling pretty similar myself\n\n\nOnce the cheering ended and the cheer team began departing to the sidelines,the mascot stayed put and and quickly turned his head towards ME\n\n\nI began sinking into my seat with my eyes closed as if by pure enstink,hoping that would make him leave me alone\n\n\nI felt a finger poking me after a minute and op-ed my eyes to see Sarah looking at me with a strange look on her face\n\n\n*What's wrong?*  She asked\n\n\nI felt my fave turn red as I looked at her and around me and noticed a few other peoole in the crowd also noticed what I did.I knew I had to lie fast\n\n\n*I was just already feeling bored by being at this dumb thing.I just want to get to what we came here to do but oh well*\n\n\nSarah looked at me with a not-so-sure look on her face before nodding and turning back towards the field\n\n\n*Smooth Mike..smooth*  I thought to myself\n\n\nThe game started and our team won pretty easily.Cai had to be the star of the show and he scored 2 touchdowns and had an interception as well\n\n\nThankfully,the mascot acted normal for the rest of the game .Typical dances,joking around etc.I was hoping that it really was just a huge joke\n\n\nOnce the game was over.The crowd jumped up and cheered for our team.\n\nThe whole team stood in the middle of the field with thier helmets raised in the air as the cheer team stood in front of them waving thier poms poms\n\n\nMy friends and I were barely interested and turned to leave the stands when we saw someone blocking the stair way...the mascot\n\n\nHolding several automatic guns in each arm\n\n\nMy friends and I all looked around expecting someone to notice this and stop him but when we looked around...everyone was frozen in place\n\n\nThe crowd,the football team and cheerleaders were stiff as boards.So.ist all of them with huge smiles and wide eyes on their faces ...so happy looking\n\n\nAll of us were terrified as we turned back to look at the \"mascot\" who then tossed the guns into the air that somehow landed in each of our arms\n\n\n\n*Do it* \n\nThat same Inhumane whisper demanded coldly\n\nAs if we were all hypnotized ,each of my friends and I all pointed our weapons at the frozen people all around us in different directions\n\n\nMy weapon was facing towards the field,directly at Cai\n\n\nHis face much like everyone else.Frozen in happiness.His gold helmet raised in the air after a great game\n\n\nMy finger began to pull the trigger when out of nowhere every thing went black.\n\n\nMy vision returned to the sound of screams all around me.Everyone around us saw that my friends and I all had guns pointed at them.\n\n\nIn shock and confusion,we all set the guns down an pleased the panicked crowd to relax and we tried to tell them we wouldn't hurt anyone.\n\n\nI know...hard to believe\n\n\n\nMany of the members in the audience ran away but other people began tackling us to the ground.Before we all knew it,police showed up and cuffed us all\n\n\nNone of us had an alibi and I'm sure the rest of my friends besides Mason had any idea what to make of this whole thing.\n\n\nWe all remained silent.We were all silent do to being in shock over what just happened anyway\n\nI saw Cai giving his statement to police before glaring at me.The jackass was going to get even more attention now\n\n\nI could already see the headlines\n\n\n\"Star Football player nearly killed by weird loner after playoff victory on Friday night\"\n\n\nAs I was loaded into the back of the cop car,I looked out the window and saw the mascot still standing in the field alone\n\nHe was making body and hand motions as if he were laughing hysterically while pointing at\nme\n\n\n\nSo here's what's happening now\n\nMy friends and I are all facing serious charges of gun possession,Consiracy to commit murder,attempted murder etc\n\nI write this from my cell.I'm hoping for a bond but not counting on it.I'll probably never leave\n\nMaybe I actually did die and this is some kind if hell\n\n\nI'm stuck here in this jail from hell.To make matters worse,Every prision guard here has the head of that mascot\n\n\nThat stupid beard \"those huge eyes and that weird hat are all I see.They never speak either.They just come to my cell door and state at me for hours .\n\n\nAs I curl into the back of my cell and beg them to stop and leave me alone.\n\n\nPlease,believe me...Please help me.",

        "text": "Just to remind you all, this happened when I was nineteen. It's sort of a continuation of [what I told you about last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) and like it says in the title, this is gonna explain why I'm always in a wedding dress. I know some of you have been aching to hear about that.\n\nI had just met the son of my mother's deceased childhood friend, namely Jacek, the new Lord of the black mill. My feelings towards him were complicated; for one, he scared me shitless, but he was also the hottest guy I'd ever met. I was rather certain he liked me, too. \n\nMy little brother and I always went ice skating on the lake by the mill, the sole reason being that Jacek would see me. He would watch us every time, keeping his distance for courtesy's sake. I'd meet his gaze, show him I knew, but nothing more. One time, he actually waved to me in that \"come hither\"-kind of way, and all I did was shake my head. He went back inside, slamming the door so hard that the sound reverberated across the twin lakes. \n\nThat day, I waited until dark to return to the mill. I knocked on Jacek's door, and though it took him a while to answer, the look on his face was well worth the wait.\n\n\"Hi,\" he said.\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\nSilence. Then, \"Fiona, what are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Saying hi.\" \n\n\"That's… that's it? Fiona, it's two a.m., you're in the middle of the woods—aren't you cold?\"\n\n\"Freezing.\" I smiled, hearing him swallow when the gears started turning.\n\nMaking haste to step aside, he held the door open for me. \"It's really much warmer in here.\"\n\nI walked past him, hugging myself. \"Still kinda chilly.\"\n\n\"I have a bed, too,\" Jacek suggested readily.\n\nSaid bed wasn't much more comfortable than the floor; a comparison founded on factual evidence. Two days later, we tried mine instead, and thus, Jacek climbing up the wall of the house and onto my balcony at night became a regular occurrence. Though he was a few years my senior, he hadn't been with another woman before—not too surprising, all things considered. So let's just say I had some explaining to do. But feeling wanted by him was the most intense sensation I had experienced since my soul had run off on me. He knew I'd been crazy about him from the start as well. Sharing this deep admiration for one another was amazing. \n\nWe got along great on a personal level, too. He introduced me to the hellhound he'd summoned for company and taught me some basic spells that weren't necessarily *black* magic, just useful, not-unholy witchery. I'd read to him—not that he couldn't, he merely hated the eyestrain—and take him out into town occasionally to show him the basics of modern human life. He was a bit of a pyromaniac, but I thought it was cool that he could light a fire using nothing but sticks and rocks. So crafty. In hindsight, he was really kind of perfect. I can't think of any man I'd ever respected or felt more attracted to. \n\nBut something was missing, and of course things went wrong. I should have really seen it coming when he asked me to marry him.\n\n\"Jacek, we've known each other for five months.\"\n\n\"My parents knew each other for three, what are you saying? Too soon for you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, way too soon. Three months might have worked for them, but not me. Sorry.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay. I hear you. I'll wait.\"\n\nHe asked again six months later and was absolutely bewildered when I still told him no. \"Honestly, how long do you wanna wait?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. I'm just not there yet, you know.\"\n\n\"It's been close to a year!\"\n\n\"Exactly, not even a full twelve months.\"\n\nJacek threw his arms up. \"Fine, I'll wait another year, for pity's sake.\"\n\nNow, I thought there wouldn't *be* another year. He was just asking for too much too fast, and besides—I hadn't even thought of the implications of such a marriage, and I refused to. I didn't *love* Jacek. I wasn't sure I could really love anybody. Too much of me was missing for such a strong emotion. I never told him that, but he never asked either, and I understood soon enough that he simply took it for granted. He figured that since we were sleeping together, that had to mean I loved him and would marry him someday. He wasn't at fault for thinking that way. Our concepts of love were simply worlds apart. The problem was that I could never bring myself to inform him of that. \n\nBeing with him made me feel good, and I pushed back the thoughts of our inevitable break-up, procrastinating for my own sake while he kept growing more and more attached. I tried to delude myself into believing that he didn't actually want to marry me. How would that even work? My family had no idea we were an item, he lived in a haunted mill in what was still my parents' land, and who the hell would even wed us? The Devil?\n\nHe just had to know all this, right? He had to know we could never be for real.\n\nWell, he didn't. I found out about that when he asked me again two years later. I couldn't take it anymore, I knew I was stringing him along and that I had been doing so for far too long. It was wintertime again, and we'd been on a scenic little walk around the twin lakes, careful to avoid the guards on their rounds. \n\n\"About that,\" I began hesitantly, \"I don't think we can really go into that direction.\"\n\nJacek stopped in his tracks. \"Elaborate.\"\n\n\"You don't *actually* see this going anywhere, do you? I mean, we can't get married. It's just not an option.\"\n\nHis brows furrowed. \"It would be, if you wanted to.\"\n\n\"Then I guess I don't,\" I said meekly, my throat bone dry. \n\n\"Why?\" His voice was the same monotonous, flat bass he'd used when talking about the loss of his father.\n\n\"Did you never… stop to think about it all?\" \n\n\"Wouldn't have asked you thrice if I didn't.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I mean the big picture,\" I stammered, fumbling for words. \"It'd be kinda complicated, no?\"\n\n\"Most good things are. Mom and Dad had their own problems, but they were happy.\"\n\n\"We're not your mom and dad, though,\" I argued. \"I don't wanna stay in these woods forever! I know my mother wants me to, but, like… I'm gonna leave this shit behind someday. Not anytime soon, but someday.\"\n\n\"Yeah, so? I'd come with you.\"\n\n\"You've literally sworn yourself to the Devil!\"\n\n\"Exactly. I've got amazing outside connections.\"\n\n\"Jacek, no… There's just no way.\"\n\n\"I don't get you,\" he said blankly. \"What did I do wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing, this is just… out of your control.\"\n\n\"Don't you love me?\" he asked.\n\nI fell silent. I felt beyond cruel; my face was burning with shame and something in my chest seemed to break. There was an actual, physical sensation; a sting so painful I kind of wanted to check if there wasn't a knife sticking out of my body somewhere. \n\n\"Don't you love me?\" Jacek repeated, taking a step towards me. \n\nI very slightly shook my head. Then, I was treated to a thoroughly unwholesome sight. I could actually make out the second his heart broke. It was this single, awful moment when his eyes flew open and all his features seemed to derail.\n\n\"Fucking hell, Fiona! It's been three years!\" \n\nHot tears started rolling down my cheeks. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"You never thought to mention any of that? I thought you just needed more time…\" He started sputtering, pale face turning red as his shoulders began to tremble. \"Why the fuck would you do that to me?\" he howled, and I instinctively took a step back.\n\n\"Please, calm down…\"\n\n\"No, I won't calm the hell down! What were you thinking? Did you *like* it?\" \n\nI listened in horror as his voice got deeper and deeper, slowly contorting into a warped, chill-inducing growl as his face twisted into a grimace of wrath and pain. This wasn't the same man I'd walked alongside mere minutes ago. This was something else, and I didn't want to find out what.\n\n\"*Did you like playing me for a fool?*\"\n\n\"Jacek, what's happening to you?\" I pressed out.\n\n\"*You should know! You're doing it!*\"\n\nI kept on stumbling backwards, trying to distance myself from him, but he kept on inching towards me, taking weirdly slow, wonky steps. His whole body was twitching like a distorted image on a glitching screen. My heart sank at the sound of bones cracking. His knees were slowly turning *inside out*, accompanied by the most awful noise I'd ever heard, a grinding crunch. \n\nJacek's legs gave way beneath him and he dropped to the ground, curling up as he began to cough violently. The blood he threw up painted the pristine snow in the darkest shade of red I'd ever seen. I was panicking, screaming at the top of my lungs. Caution thrown to the wind, I'd flung myself to the ground beside him, grabbing him, holding him, cradling him as he kept on spitting and wheezing. I tried to keep his head still as he kept bashing it into the ground in his frenzy, his eyes unnaturally wide and filled with mindless terror. \n\nThen, all of a sudden, it was over. Jacek let out one last, long cry as his body seemed to violently stretch itself, stiffening like a board as his bones snapped back into place. For a moment, he merely laid there on his back in the tossed over, bloodied snow, his limbs slowly relaxing and his voice returning to normal as he slowly but surely managed to catch his breath.\n\nHe opened his eyes to meet my gaze. The warmth had vanished from them completely, and the iciness left over sent chills down my spine. I recoiled, raising my hands to grouch my burning throat. My heart was still drumming wildly, my pulse racing in my ears. I was beyond dazed, the horror of the situation not relinquishing its grip on me.\n\n\"What was that?\" I finally breathed. \n\nJacek pushed himself up onto his elbows, gazing up into the gray sky. \"I'm sorry,\" he muttered absently. \"My body works a little differently. I'm okay now.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" I whispered.\n\nHe slowly turned to face me, opening his jacket and peeling aside his shirt. I froze in my spot. Cold dread crept into my core upon laying eyes in his chest. \n\nThere was a *hole*.\n\nA big, black, oozing hole right where his heart was supposed to be. Blood was still dripping from the edges, framed by flayed skin and protruding bits of torn flesh.\n\n\"No.\" It was all I could say. \"Jacek, I'm so sorry…\"\n\nHe let out a soft little chuckle as he got to his feet. \"Oh, you will be.\" He grabbed a fistful of the tainted red snow, and before I could react, he smeared it right across my face. \"Stay seated, it's okay,\" he muttered. \"This won't hurt a bit.\" An amused smile spread on his face as he knelt down in front of me and started piling fresh snow on my lap. I was still too shocked to move; I just stared at him in confusion before finally breaking out of my stupor and batting his hand away. \n\nHe smirked. \"Too late.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You made me real angry, you know. And I have to move on like this. This—\" He tapped his chest. \"—this isn't gonna heal anytime soon. It wouldn't be fair if you just got to go back to normal. Oh, don't worry, you'll look so wonderful.\"\n\n\"The fuck are you talking about?\" I brushed off the snow, staggering to my feet, only to realize that the gray coat I'd been wearing had turned into a long, white skirt. Feeling the sting of the cold on my bare shoulders, I noticed that the only thing shielding my upper body from the elements was a thin layer of lace. My very first wedding dress. Jacek was doubling over with laughter. It echoed through the forest and then turned into loud, shivering sobs and wails again as he started walking off, leaving me to stare and shudder.\n\nI never saw him again after that. It didn't take me long to figure out what exactly he had done to me—I couldn't wear normal clothes anymore. They would singe my skin like fire, and biting through the pain wasn't an option, for they would fall off by themselves if I kept them on for longer than a couple minutes. Since my only alternative was walking around in my underwear, I resigned myself and started buying up all kinds of bridal gowns. \n\nSo that's why I hate talking about Jacek. Casimir loves that story, he thinks it's hilarious, but I don't like it nearly as much.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103yryr/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105nlp7/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

I always walk behind her and sleep under her bed. For the first few months, she was scared of her stalker. She even went to the police for her safety. But after investigation, they could not find her stalker. Obviously they cannot find me. \n\nAfter months of practice, I have learned how to be invisible. I can move without making a sound. I can hide in the shadows like they are my own. I can make things move in the house without even making an entrance.\n\nMy obsession with my best friend began when she became pregnant with her child. I started following her. I woke up in her room every morning and my watch began. After months of being with her when I got to know she was having a baby girl, I got even more obsessed. \n\nWhen she was in her second trimester, my best friend was diagnosed with cancer. Doctors had to operate her womb, but fortunately the baby was safe. She has been going through chemotherapy since then. She used to be a beautiful bright girl, but now, I see her baggy eyes and bald head and a baby bump on a fragile body. She is barely alive. Her family is always there to support her. But no one can support her more than I do. \n\nLast month, she was in the grocery store with her mother. A guy in the store started to follow them to the parking lot. The guy didn't notice me. As she and her mother got inside their car, the guy went to his own car and started driving behind them. Little did he know that I sneaked on his hind seats. \n\nI knew he had some horrible intentions when I saw the duct tape and saw beside me. I thought to myself, \"I have to react now, else it will be too late\". So I took the saw and started chopping his head. The car crashed onto a tree, and it fell over the roof of the car. Instantly, he was crushed under the weight, but nothing happened to me. Nothing can happen to me as I already died in a car crash a year back. \n\nI watch over my best friend and even she knows it now. I had promised to be her guardian angel when I first met her. I kept my promise. I made a deal with the angels that I'll stay here until the baby is born and my best friend is fully recovered. \n\nToday, a healthy baby girl was born. Bestie named her after me. She knew that would be the highest form of honour that she could give me. The girl looks exactly like her. Bestie looks better than before. I can even see a few strands of hair growing on her head. \nToday is the day I will leave my astral self and say goodbye. Today is my one year death anniversary and my niece's birthday. I will always be protecting them no matter where, no matter when. I will always stalk her forever.",

        "text": "“Room 12,” Olga said, thrusting a clipboard into my hands. “She’s a fun one.”\n\nI scowled. “A *fun* one? Wait, what do you mean by that?”\n\nShe only laughed in response, striding down the hallway as quickly as she possibly could. I watched her purple-scrubbed silhouette turn down the corner, then disappear.\n\n*Well, shit.* I guess I was stupid for thinking things would be slow the Monday after Christmas. Didn’t we have enough alcohol poisonings and pine-tree-related injuries? And don’t even get me started on that guy who thought he was Santa Claus…\n\n“Olga, you little jerk,” I muttered under my breath. Then I slugged down the rest of my coffee, threw it in the bin, and stepped into room 12.\n\nIt was a woman. A quite pretty woman, with long black hair and olive skin. I glanced at the file. *Tanya Rodrigo… 23, single… stats normal…* I sat down at the computer station and turned towards her, faking a smile. “So what brings you in here tonight?”\n\n“I don’t feel well.”\n\n*Oh, that’s very helpful.* “Can you be more specific?”\n\n“I don’t feel like myself.”\n\n“More specific.”\n\n“My head… feels foggy.”\n\n“Okay. We can work with that.” I clacked at the keys. “Do you have pain? Or is it sort of like, a pressure in your head?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nOh yeah. Olga was right. This was a *fun* one. “Any other symptoms?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Okay, look, Tanya,” I said, swiveling around on my stool. “This is the emergency room. It’s almost three am. Clearly you are feeling something *bad* to bring yourself in here. If it’s something you can’t talk about with me, that’s okay. But we’re here to help. We have counselors, or if you’re in an abusive household, we can—”\n\n“No. I’ll tell you.” She let out a big sigh. “This sounds so stupid, but… I feel like someone else is in my head.”\n\nA chill went down my spine. “Okay. Okay, yeah.” I nodded at her, silently, unsure what to say. I wasn’t wholly prepared to deal with mental symptoms. Here in the ER, it was mostly grisly injuries, blood and guts… you know, the easy stuff.\n\n“Have you had any thoughts of self-harm, or anything like that?” I asked.\n\n“No.”\n\n“So uh… why do you feel like someone else is in your head?”\n\nShe puffed out a breath. “I get these thoughts, images, flashing through my head. They’re very disturbing,” she added.\n\n“Intrusive thoughts.”\n\n“Yeah, but… worse. I had to call in sick to work, today. Because the thoughts were just playing in my head, nonstop. Really violent, horrible things…” She paused, as if considering whether to elaborate on the details. Then she shook her head. “Just really bad things.”\n\n“Okay. Thanks for telling me, Tanya. I’m just going to enter that in my notes…” I turned back towards the computer—\n\nAnd froze.\n\nIn the window behind the computer, I saw her reflection.\n\nShe was smiling.\n\nNot just smiling—*grinning.* This huge, deranged grin stretching across her face as she stared at me. Like she knew something I didn’t, and was just waiting for me to figure it out. The type of grin you see on people like Charles Manson.\n\nI whipped around—\n\nTanya wasn’t smiling.\n\nI looked back at the window. But now, her reflection showed what I expected: the profile of a troubled young woman, looking down at the floor.\n\nI swallowed. *Relax. She was probably just smiling at you. And you interpreted it as some deranged grin because you got, what, four hours of sleep today?* It had been a long day. I’d been dragged to my niece’s birthday party, which was smack in the middle of my daytime sleep.\n\nI stifled a yawn. “Sorry. Just a few more questions. How long has this been going on?”\n\n“About two or three weeks.”\n\n“Okay. And it’s interfered with work, and your daily life, right?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nI asked her more routine questions and typed all the notes into her file. “Okay. I’m going to get the doctor now, okay?” I grabbed my phone, checked the time—a little after 3. Damn, four more hours to go. I yawned again and turned off the phone’s screen—\n\n*No.*\n\nShe was right behind me.\n\nI saw her reflection clear as day in my phone’s screen. Peeking over my shoulder. Grinning that horrible, deranged grin. Her dark eyes locked on mine, and her hands—her hands going for my neck—\n\nI leapt back.\n\nAnd when I turned, Tanya was in the same place as before. Sitting on the bed, looking at the floor.\n\n“I’m gonna get the doctor now,” I said. And then I dashed out into the hallway.\n\nI took a shuddering breath. And then another. I glanced back at the room—but Tanya was still staring at the floor, fidgeting with her hands.\n\n*What* was *that?*\n\nI mean. Had she really tried to… strangle me? But then, how did she get back to the bed so fast? And she seemed perfectly normal. A woman with some intrusive thoughts. Not a serial killer.\n\nBut I’d seen what I’d seen.\n\nShe was going to grab my throat. There was no denying it.\n\nI’ll admit, part of me wanted to just throw Olga back in there and see what happened. But my stupid little conscience forced me to do the right thing and find Dr. Cohen. “Can I talk to you for a sec?” I panted.\n\n“Sure,” he replied.\n\nDr. Cohen was a graying old man with all the fierceness of a teddy bear. He looked at me with soft concern as I pulled him aside in the hallway and spoke in a low voice. “In room 12, we have a woman that… uh… well, she seems to be describing intrusive thoughts. But she… when I had my back turned, she looked like she was going to strangle me.”\n\n“Strangle you?”\n\n“She had her hands—like this.” I mimed her claw-like hands, going for my neck.\n\n“Okay, hmm.” Any other doctor would have freaked out, probably, but Dr. Cohen just nodded thoughtfully. “I’ll go to her right now.”\n\nI followed him down the hallway. “Be careful,” I whispered as he opened the door. I watched as he disappeared inside, chewing my nails. *What if she murders him in there?* But Dr. Cohen was a six-foot-tall former football player. He could defend himself, right?\n\n… Right?\n\nTen nail-biting minutes later, Dr. Cohen came out. He gave me a reassuring nod. “She seems fine,” he said. “I prescribed her some anti-anxiety meds that I think will help. Thank you for the heads-up, though!”\n\nHe gave my arm a squeeze and continued down the hallway.\n\nBut I couldn’t move.\n\nI was frozen. All the breath had been sucked out of my lungs. All I could do was stare, paralyzed, as the good doctor walked away from me.\n\nBecause in the glass double-doors, I saw his reflection.\n\nAnd the wide smile stretching across his face, as he locked eyes with me.",

        "text": "I know what you all are thinking. Animals are weird, unpredictable even, but I just can’t shake this feeling I’ve had.  \n\n I found her while I was hiking earlier today and she’d looked like she’d been out there for days, maybe even weeks. She wore a mangled collar that was basically a tattered string at this point. I looked at the tag and all the tag said was Daisy. No contact information for any potential owner.\n\nWhen I found her, her eyes looked, well looked sort of human. Like she had some sort of soul in there. Also something about her just didn’t look right. She looked like one of those taxidermy animals you see in a museum. However , I just chalked it down to the fact that she was probably unwell. \n\nLike any sensible person would I took her home with me, because who knows how long she would have lasted out there on her own. Especially with winter approaching. I gave her a bath as well as some fresh food and water. I set up a make shift bed on the ground with some spare blankets I had laying around. \n\nAt this point it was getting late, so I got ready for bed. I planned on taking her to the local vet in the morning to have her checked out. Before I laid down, however, I decided to post an ad in a local facebook group. Hoping to reunite her with her owners. I’m sure they have been worried sick about her. I mean she had to have come from somewhere.\n\nAfter making the post I put my phone down and crawled into bed. I closed my eyes and instantly fell asleep. I woke up to an eerily weird noise. It was a sound I could barely explain. Almost like the sound of a baby crying but not quite. \n\nI slowly opened my eyes and felt like someone or something was watching me. I turned my head slowly toward the door to find Daisy. She was just sitting there with her eyes set on me. Except she didn’t look like her self anymore. The longer I looked the more obscure she became. Then suddenly her body contorted, it was so unnatural it almost looked like I was watching a video game glitch. There is no other way to describe it.\n\nUnsettled I turned over in my bed, so that I no longer faced the door. At that moment my phone pinged. It was a facebook message from the post of Daisy. My eyes squinting at the light of the screen, I read the message. ‘Where did you find her? Tell me now it’s urgent!’\n\nHesitantly I responded, telling the woman I found her in the woods near the creek. While awaiting a response I checked the time. Why would someone message about this post at this time of night? Before I could think I got a response. ‘Listen to me please, put that thing outside. That creature is not a dog and you are not safe. Put it outside now and lock all the doors.’\n\nAs I read this message I had almost forgot about the strange noise that awoke me. It had stopped. I then glanced at the door to see if Daisy was still there. Except now the doorway was empty. \n\nNow here I am writing this. I don’t know what to do. What was that message? How do I respond? Do I respond? Was that really Daisy in the door or was it my half awake brain scaring me? \n\nCall me stupid if you want for typing this instead of investigating further. I just don’t know what to do, I don’t even know what’s happening.",

        "text": "You've read the title by now. \n\nMy cousin is missing.\n\nShe dissappeared from her hospital room, and nobody has any idea where she is. I'm the only one who seems to care anymore. Nobody believes me when I try to tell them it was her, the woman from the woods. She'd taken my cousin, I knew she had, no one else could have. But nobody believed me. They all said I was crazy, another Myrefall resident driven insane by the local myth.\n\nBut, I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nIn most small towns, you'll hear a story or two about a creepy house in the woods, or ghosts residing in old hospitals or libraries. Myrefall had its fair share of stories, of course. But one stuck out to the town, and those who visited.\n\nThey called her Morrigan. She apparently resided in an old cabin in the woods behind the local convenience store. I never really believed it, it got passed around so much that nobody really knew what the real story was. But a few details were agreed upon. The house was in that woods, somewhere, her name was Morrigan, and you could only see her at a specific time in the night. A little after midnight, some people said 12:32, some said 12:01, nobody was exactly sure. But it had to be that specific time in every story, if you wanted to see her. \n\nMy cousin had always believed in the paranormal, and this story particularly sparked her interest. She'd been obsessed with it since we were kids. Sometimes when she'd come over she'd recite to me the newest version of the story she'd heard.  She'd sit on my bed and stare at me with those big eyes until I finally started laughing and she'd get all upset and tell me it wasn't funny. She always took the stories so seriously, she'd get upset if I even smiled at a scary part. But I'd always listen anyways, as intently as I could, even though I'd get bored.\nI couldn't help it, Julie was my favorite person in the world. Since our mothers were sisters, we were always around eachother. We'd been constantly together since we were born, and we were still best friends as teenagers. By the time we were 16, Julie still hadn't gotten over her obsession with the story. Actually, it had gotten worse. She'd spend hours in the woods every weekend, looking behind the convenience store at every chance she got. It was a little weird, sure, but I'd go with her anyways. \n\nExcept for one time. \n\nOne fucking time. \n\nI was busy that day. I had work from 9-3, and after that I was going to my boyfriend's house. I told Julie I could go with her another time, and she seemed disappointed and said she'd go alone. \n\nShe didn't come home for days. \n\n5, to be exact. Her parents called me when she didn't come home on the first night, and I'd told them I hadn't seen her. On the 2nd day, some friends and I went around the woods looking for her. We found no luck. On the third day her parents called the police, and a group of people in town went searching. I stayed home. On the 4th day, I thought about going out on my own. I decided against it. On the 5th day, she showed up on my doorstep in the middle of the night. I brought her inside, and called her dad. He came and got her, and I thought all was said and done. \n\nI saw her at school a few days later, and something felt wrong. There wasn't that light in her big eyes, and she was avoiding all of her friends, and me. I tried to approach her, and she started walking in the opposite direction. Everytime I saw her, her eyes were glued out the window. She was always staring at something, something I couldn't see. \n\nAfter a week of this, her mom took her to a therapist. She told me Julie needed the help, that something must have happened during those 5 days, something none of us were qualified to deal with. Her mom said it wasn't my fault, that Julie should've known better that to go in the woods alone. \n\nThinking about it now, I think it was my fault. Maybe nothing would have happened if I'd just gone along. That's besides the point. \n\nJulie wasn't getting any better, infact her mental state seemed to be deteriorating quickly. Her mom had checked her into a mental hospital at this point, and I visited her every day. \n\nEven when I tried to talk to her, she'd just sit in the chair by the window, staring over at the woods. I wish I knew for sure what she was looking at, but I can't say. But I can make a guess.\n\nOn the 16th day of Julie being in the hospital, I went to visit her again. Something was off today. This time she was staring at the courtyard, not the woods. And this time? I could see something too. \n\nThere was a woman standing in the corner of the courtyard, just out of view of the cameras. Her skin seemed waxy and grey, her black hair was stringy and matted together in some places. She was wearing a white dress, it looked like it was straight out of the Victorian era. It was stained with yellow, red, and brown. A mix of dirt, blood.. and well. What looked like piss was building up at the bottom. I could see her bare feet sticking out from under the skirt, and I started to get worried. The ground was so hot this time of year, you could probably cook and egg on it. I was worried she was a patient who had gotten out, and nobody knew. I started to stand up to find a doctor, but Julie grabbed my wrist. Her big eyes were even wider than normal, and she looked panicked. She was gripping her nails into my skin for dear life, and for a moment I froze and looked over her. She looked sickly, her skin felt waxy against my own, and her ginger hair was matting together at the ends. \n\nI finally regained my ability to move, and I ripped my arm away from her in a panic. There was blood beading up from where her nails had been. I ran off to find a doctor, and by the time we got back, Julie was gone. There was no sign of struggle, not even a sign she'd ever gotten up from her chair. \n\nEven now I wonder what happened that day. I've spent nights worrying about her, about where she could've gone. I'm starting to think she may not even be alive anymore. \n\nI'll push that thought out of my mind for now, it's not gonna help my mood at all. \n\nI've been looking into the whole Morrigan thing recently, because I really do believe she took my cousin. Even when no one else believes me, I know she did. \n\nApparently she was a real person. She was actually born in Myrefall, and raised here too. Morrigan isn't even her name apparently. \n\nHer real name was Victoria Morgan, apparently. She was the daughter of one of the wealthiest families in town, infact some even regarded them as THE wealthiest family in town. I couldn't dig up much about her, probably for good reason, but from what I could gather, her family didn't like her much. She had this odd fascination with death according to some articles. Even when she was a kid, shed go off into the woods and bring back dead birds and rabbits. No one was sure if she killed them, or if she found them dead. I'm assuming they didn't want to know, so they didn't ask. That tends to be how things go in this town. \n\nI found a picture of her when she was alive in one of the old newspapers. I recognized her black hair, and the white dress, but everything else looked different. Her skin looked less grey, more pale and rosey. Her eyes were visible, a vivid green color. And her hair seemed done up in a bun with some curls framing her face. She had some small beauty marks across her cheeks, ones that I hadn't seen when I saw her outside the hospital. \n\nAs much as I didn't want to admit it, she really was gorgeous. She was a monster, sure, but she was a really pretty monster. I realized I was getting distracted, I was supposed to be looking for information about her, not just staring at her picture. I needed to find Julie. \n\nHer death wasn't covered much, I only found 2 articles about it. They both told the same story. \n\nEven though her family didn't exactly care about her much, they still supported some of the decisions she made. Like living in the woods with her close friend from the day she turned 17, to the day she died. The other girls name was Marsha Walker, and there was hardly any information about her online. Besides one picture of her and who I assumed was Morrigan. Marsha looked a lot like Julie, I thought. The same big eyes and dainty nose. The thin lips that curled up when she smiled. The long, curly ginger hair. It made me sad to look at. I really, really miss Julie. \n\nSome sources said that Morrigan and Marsha were in love, that they moved to the cabin in the woods to hide from their families. I wouldn't be surprised if that was true. \n\nApparently Morrigan had died the night of the wedding her parents arranged for her. She was to marry some rich dude from Addervale, but she had unfortunately been found dead in her cabin. No one was entirely sure what had happened, but she was found with multiple stab wounds. Some say they were self-inflicted, while some say the murder was an act of jealousy by Marsha. I believe the self-inflicted theory more. I'm getting off topic again. Apparently Marsha had been convicted of a different crime and hanged shortly after. The town had damned her to hell before her death, but I don't believe in that stuff. \n\nNow you're probably wondering where this story is going. If I ever found Julie.\n\nI didn't. I still haven't.. It's been almost a year since she dissappeared. Why am I writing this then? Because I've been seeing things. Well, not things, rather, her. I've been seeing Morrigan for days. Everytime she's closer than the last, and yesterday I saw her outside my living room window. As much as I'm scared, I'm also not. If this means I get to see Julie again? I'm not complaining. Besides, now that I look at Morrigan closer, she's still rather pretty. Maybe it won't be that bad. \n\nI'm logging off my computer now. I can hear her outside of my door, and I'm getting tired. My boyfriend is asleep in the bed beside me. I wonder if she'll take him too. I hope she doesn't. I'd like for it just to be us. \n\n- Maya Walker's last words. Found written on her computer by her boyfriend after her dissappearance. If anyone has seen Maya, or Julie, please call,\n\nJoshua: ×××-×××-××××\nor,\nMyrefall County Police Department: \n×××-×××-××××",

        "text": "I didn't believe it at first when my teenage daughter told me about it. \n\n\"There was this creepy naked old man who was just looking at me.\" My daughter said, making a face. \n\nHer words kind of just blew past me and I unintionally ignored her, continuing on with my chores. \n\n\"Hello? Earth to mom?\" \n\n\"Yeah, can you repeat that?\" I responded, still not giving her my full attention.\n\n\"A naked man?\" She said.\n\n\"What about a naked man?\" \n\n\"He's outside walking around the street.\" It finally hit me what she was saying and I looked at her. \"Where?\" I turned off the water and walked over to the living room windows to peer outside, it was dark and nothing really visible.\n\n\"Just around here, I saw him a couple blocks away, he gave me this creepy smile.\" She shuddered. \n\nI started looking around for my phone. \"I'll call the police and let them know.\" It was currently only 9PM, so it's not like it was that late, meaning kids could still see this naked creep. \n\nAfter a short informative call, the police informed me that they'd send a unit to look around incase he's still around here, I thanked them and hung up. \n\nMy daughter had already went up stairs, and my husband wasn't getting home for another hour or two, so I resumed my chores. After some unspecified amount of time, I was broken out of my thoughts by the sound of our door bell. Which was really strange, as my husband had a key, and my daughter was home. I walked over to the door and looked through the peephole. \n\nThere was a strange man standing just outside of our property. Completely naked, besides a pair of white shoes. He was really hairy, which obstructed his facial features from being recognized. I cursed under my breath and fished out my phone to call the cops. \n\n\"Hello, yes, I called some time ago about a naked creep roaming the neighbourhood. Well he just rang my doorbell and is standing outside my property, just looking at my house, still fully nude.\" \n\n\"Yes, I remember, we sent a unit over and they still should be around, let me radio them in, what's your address?\" \n\n\"It's Cloverfield 23rd.\" \n\n\"They'll be there within a minute or two, just stay on the line with me and tell me what the man is doing.\" \n\nI look through the peephole again. \"He's just standing there, his front towards me.\"\n\n\"Is he armed?\" \n\n\"Not that I can tell, no.\" \n\nI kept observing him. \"What are you looking at?\" I yelped in surprise at my daughter's sudden appearance. \"You scared me.\" I told her, and then continued. \"That creep.. He's just standing at the sidewalk, looking at our house.\"\n\nMy daughter made yet another face. \"Maybe he followed me..\", then she said \"Let me look.\" She walked over to the front door and looked through the hole before I could say anything.\n\n\"There's nobody there?\" She said, confused.\n\n\"What? Let me look.\" I gently pushed her aside, sure enough, the man was gone. \"Excuse me, the man is gone.\" I informed the operator.\n\n\"Did you see where he went?\" She asked me. \"No, I looked away to talk to my daughter, and during that time he disappeared.\" \n\n\"Okay, police should be there any second now.\" \n\nThe doorbell rang. For some reason, hearing the words police should be there, accompanied by the door bell ringing, made me assume it was the police, and I opened the door without thinking twice. And there he was, the naked man, just standing there. However what terrified me wasn't the man, or him being naked, but the large knife he was holding in his right hand. \n\n\"Run and hide!\" I screamed at my daughter, who quickly obliged and ran upstairs. I ran to the kitchen to arm myself. The man however didn't follow neither of us.\n\n\"Hello? Are you there? Is everything okay?\" I could hear the operator's voice coming from the front door, where I dropped my phone in my haze. I slowly and silently made my way to look at the doorway, the man was still standing outside, but his back was turned to me. \n\nI took this chance to try and get my phone. As soon as I had it in my hands the operator spoke again. \"The police is there, just stay tight.\" The man snapped in my direction, and began walking over. \"No!\" I screamed, starting to walk upstairs backwards. \n\n\"He killed them.\" The man spoke in a raspy voice. \n\nTaking a closer look, I could see all sorts of wounds on his naked body, from bruises to cuts to even stitches. I was now at the top of the stairwell, but he wasn't taking the stairs. \"So I'm gonna kill you to repay the favor.\" He spoke once more, and began walking up the stairs, knife at the ready. I held my own knife with my two shaky hands right in front of me. The stairs creaked as he took them one by one very slowly, he was limping too.\n\n\"Please!\" I muttered out pleas, but he wouldn't stop, he just wouldn't stop coming closer, step by step, and eventually he reached the last few. \n\nThat's when I heard a voice I thought I'd never hear again. \"El!\" My husband screamed and tackled the man from behind, both of them tumbling down the stairs. Simultaneously, two police officers ran up to our house, their guns at the ready. \"Police! Hands where I can see them!\" My husband recovered first and stood up with his hands up. \"I'm this houses owner!\" He said and the police officer nodded, observing the man who was now laying on the ground, a pool of blood next to him. I realised he had gotten stabbed in the small wrestle with my husband. \"I'm a nurse! I can treat him!\" my instincts kicked it as I rushed down the stairs and to the man's side. He was laying on his side, the knife was somewhere in the pit of his stomach.\n\nA police officer kneeled down beside me. \"We're calling the ambulance, can you provide first aid?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I responded, and then snapped commands at my husband. \"Get me the first aid kit from the garrage!\" He looked at me reluctantly. \"What are you waiting for?\" He snapped out of it and walked out of the house. The officer radioed in the accident while I stayed by the man, trying to put pressure on his stab wound. \n\n\"The devil..\" The man rasped. \"He's the devil..\" \n\n\"Shh, don't speak.\" I shushed him, but he kept speaking. \"He killed them..\" He coughed out. \"He will kill again.\" I realised then, that this man wouldn't live, \"Where's the goddamn first aid kid?\" I shouted loudly. I saw my daughter peering down from the top of the stairs. \"Go to your room!\" I screamed at her in anger, and she disappeared. \n\n\"Shush, you're going to be alright.\" I don't know why I wanted to save this man so much, I mean he tried to kill me, he tried to hurt my daughter. I guess I was taught that all life was precious. Or maybe I was angry that he'd get away with it so easily if he died. \n\n\"He killed them..\" The man kept repeating. \"Who?\" I asked him. \n\n\"Him.\" He said and lost consciousness shortly after. \"Here!\" My husband finally returned, handing me the kit. I tried my best, I really did. But there's only so much I could do.\n\nThe ambulance arrived shortly after and took him, he was still alive, barely, however I found out the next morning that he had died in the hospital. They weren't able to figure out his identity. The autopsy showed that the man was under influence of strong drugs at the night of the accident, while the examination of the outside of his body confirmed that he was most likely being held somewhere against his will. \n\nI have been trying to put the pieces together, why'd he follow my daughter home? Why did he say that he'd kill us to repay the favor? The picture started coming together slowly, my husband. \n\nMy husband is a family therapist, so it makes no sense for him to come home so late, and after confirming with his secretary, I was right. he only worked till 5PM, which meant he was doing something else until he returned around 10PM. In truth, I always suspected him, I thought that maybe he was cheating, which would be quite ironic for a family therapist. But now I am assuming that something much worse is going on. \n\nAll I need is proof. I took the day off tomorrow, and I plan to follow him after work and figure out what the hell he's been up to, and I hope that's it's not what I think it is.",

        "text": "The bleeding man stumbled but kept on following. The bleeding man with vacant eyes, moaned fiendishly as he tried to catch up. The bleeding man with footsteps that matched your heartbeat. The more you get scared, the faster he chases. And he stops when your heartbeat stops. When you are dead. \n\n\nI had heard tales of the bleeding man, in parties where you cannot put a face to the words that you hear. At parties where you go to drown the voices. The ones from the outside and the ones from the inside. They said the worst thing that the bleeding man does is…\n\nI don’t remember what they said. Or it just got lost in the noise of the noise of the music. \n\n\nI turned to look over the shoulder. He was closer than before. The more tired I got, the faster my heart beat, the longer his strides got. But I can see him more clearly now. Though I couldn’t really place the face, I had seen him before. He was not a complete stranger. Maybe someone I had seen on the bus, maybe an acquaintance from the past? Somebody I had wronged, unknowingly? \n\n\nThe ghosts of my other misdeeds have haunted me before. All those times I broke my promises, all those times I let my loved ones down. Those ghosts have haunted me in the nights all the time. But never tried to kill me. But this motherfucker. Who was he? Had I run someone over? \n\n\nThe Bleeding man grew taller as I granted him more thought. He got muscular as I thought more about him, tried to decode him. Gaining more ground with the newfound strength I had given him, he reached out for me. Scratching the back of my neck. I whimpered and quickened my pace!\n\n\nThrough the parked cars, zig-zagging my way to the elevator bay that I could now see on the horizon. Think about good things, I told myself. Think about the time you went on that vacation. The vacation you went because your heart broke and you were too scared to face it and literally ran away? Fuck, that was not a good thought. Try something else, I told myself. Think about that first bicycle you were gifted.. The one that you  hated so much because everyone had better ones? Because your best friend called you a sissy girl for riding one with no bars? \n\n\nEvery good thought can become a bad one if you think it long enough. A hand came from over my shoulders and covered my face. A decayed hand with boils and blood dripping. I fell to the floor, hit my head on the cement and tears filled my eyes.. Through the water, I could just see the shape of the bleeding man looming over me. He leaned down to have a good look at me. And I got a good look at him. Still no recognition. Still can’t place that fucking face. \n\n\nHe started to weep as he unfolded a blade and started to carve my face. His tears met my fresh blood. My legs shuffled on the parking floor, trying to get away, but slipped on the ample blood that had now formed a pool around me. The physical pain was refreshing after the agonizing thoughts. I closed my eyes and relished it. After all these years, never had something felt so liberating. Not a bad thought hanging around, waiting to get me. Just pure, unadulterated, red pain. \n\n\nI opened my eyes. And screamed. He had left me undead. Hadn’t finished the job he had started. And then I remembered. Yes, that was the worst thing that he did, I remembered. He leaves you bleeding. And moaning, fiendishly. \n\n\nOh.. now I know who he was.",

        "text": "   \n\n\nI know it sounds crazy but it’s true.\n\nI was assigned to a young male patient with schizophrenia. He had been a voluntary admission because he heard voices telling him to hurt people around him, and he admitted himself because he was afraid of actually going through with it.\n\nAnyway, I went into the room alone one day, as usual, and did the usual introduction and asked how he was doing. \n\nHe was at a desk drawing creepy, hideous monsters—each monster had its own page, and there had to be at least half a dozen of these pages scattered around him. \n\nI asked him what they were. He answered that those were the monsters he saw. They were the monsters that whispered to him and told him to hurt people and do awful things.\n\nGuarded, I asked him, ‘Are they telling you to hurt me?’\n\nHe answered, ‘Yes.’\n\nI didn’t stay very long in that room.\n\n\\*   \\*   \\*\n\nThe following night I had a few nightmares from the creepy drawings my patient drew. \n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t take pictures of them. Let’s just say he prefers not to let anyone see them; not to mention take photos of them. \n\nDescribing them, I can do. \n\nOne of them has an exceptionally long neck, with what looks to be an elephant’s trunk for a head and a single eye on the tip of its trunk-like head. The torso is completely human but the legs are not there.\n\nThe next creature is more creepy and unsettling than the first.\n\nIt’s a normal male man. But his facial features are all corrupted and unnatural. \n\nThe mouth is upturned into a grotesque smile, no teeth. The eyes are mouths as well, upturned into the same weird smile as the “normal” mouth is. \n\nThere are numerous others that look like something out of a rated R horror movie.\n\nOne that has no visible limbs or head; another with legs of children protruding out of its mouth and onto the floor, and many more of these “hallucinations”. Yes, I have set off the word “hallucinations” with quotation marks because they aren’t really hallucinations.\n\nA couple of days ago, I saw one of those creatures.\n\nAnd no, I have no history of psychological disorders in my bloodline at all; which is further evidence that what I saw was goddamn real.\n\nIt all started when I had a talk with my boss.\n\nI came into the room to talk to him regarding an event that happened with that young male patient. The event was nothing serious, he just got a little aggressive because  he claims the demons were threatening him to hurt me.\n\nI grabbed the seat opposite to where my boss is sitting and caught him scowling at me.\n\n“Is there anything wrong sir?” I asked.\n\nHe seemed to scowl worse, if that’s even possible. \n\n“So you come into my office, sit down in MY seat, and ask if there’s anything wrong?”.\n\n“Sir I’m not—”.\n\n“No no, don’t “sir” me! You let a patient get aggressive in YOUR care for the first time in what, 10 years?”\n\n“11 and a half”, I corrected.\n\n“Proves my damn point”.\n\n“What even is your point, sir?”, I asked.\n\nMy boss sighed at this. “You need some rest. You have been working at this facility for more than 10 years! You need a break.”\n\nI was taken aback by that. Is he implying that I’m not doing my job properly? The patient I was in charge of was just a bit jumpy that’s all.\n\n“Sir, you can’t do that. It was just one incident and it won’t happen again, I promise”, I begged.\n\nHe sighed again. “I’ll give you a paid month off, how’s that?”\n\nI started to say something, but something stopped me. A paid month off sounds like \n\n(rest)\n\na good deal.\n\nI got up from where I was sitting and looked up at him.\n\n“Ok sir, I’ll do just that”.\n\n“Good, now you have some rest at home”.\n\n(home)\n\n(couch)\n\n(TV)\n\n(food)\n\nWhat is going on with me? What’s with these thoughts suddenly popping up in my head? I’m an extremely productive person and I don’t exactly like to sit on my ass all day and watch TV while stuffing myself with junk food.\n\nAs I left the room, I could have sworn I saw a figure with the head of an elephant’s trunk staring at me from one of the rooms down in the hallway.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nAs I went for my morning jog the next day, I found myself standing in front of the local café.\n\nThe thoughts got\n\n(need food)\n\nworse and worse to the point I was listening to them.\n\nLast night I found myself ordering 2 large margarita pizzas when I usually order one medium. Not to mention I don’t eat the whole thing.\n\nI found myself eating the entire thing in one sitting!\n\nAnd the goddamn thoughts I had. It was like someone was controlling me from the shadows.\n\nAnyway, as I entered the shop, I sensed something was wrong with me the second my eye had laid on the various sweets and cakes in the shop.\n\nIt was as if nothing else mattered but the food \n\n(eat)\n\nin the shop.\n\nThe food lit up in a strange hazy glow as if it had come from heaven. Everything else around me; the people, furniture and vehicles were all in black and white. My mind was in a trance as I charged for the food.\n\nI was faintly conscious of the elephant trunk head figure on the left side of the café.\n\nIts whole body glowing like the food in front of me.\n\n(eat)\n\n(crunch)\n\n(stuff)\n\n(munch)\n\n(scavenge)\n\n(pump)\n\n(swallow)\n\nI threw myself onto the glass containing the food and smashed it. The screaming around me was muffled but not silent.\n\nCovered in glass, I grabbed wads of cakes and sweets and stuffed myself. \n\nMinutes seemed to go by and I was still on the floor, eating almost all the food in the café. I was a mess but I didn’t care. \n\nGlass and wads of food fell to the ground as I stood up. The screaming had ceased and the food no longer shone its heavenly glow. The elephant figure seemed to have disappeared. \n\nI was no longer in a trance, and the chaos hit me like a shot from a hunter’s rifle.\n\n“H-Huh”, I stammered, not able to assess the situation and accept it. All those people…my boss, co-workers, they’re going to think I’m a lunatic!\n\nA heavy cloud of anger and sadness washed over me as I dropped to the floor again and wept.\n\nWhy? Why is this happening to me? This isn’t supposed to be real.\n\nI sniffed, tears streaming down my cheeks and onto the floor, joining the wads of food and glass.\n\n(kill)\n\nWhat?\n\nI looked up to see more than a dozen creatures standing over me. I choked back a sob.\n\n(kill)\n\n(hurt)\n\n(vandalise)\n\n(break)\n\n(attack)\n\n(upset)\n\n(crush)\n\nSo many voices.\n\nWhat do they want from me?\n\nThe demon with the smiling eyes and tuxedo reached out and gently stroked my right cheek. His smiling eyes and mouth seemed to grow wider until the uncanny crescents covered his entire face.\n\n(mine)\n\nThe thought reached my mind before it said anything. \n\nThe other demons were now squirming and making noises that resembled a fox in distress. \n\n(no he’s mine)\n\n(NO MINE)\n\n(ARGHHHHH)\n\n(animals animals, relax. We all know he’s mine. I touched him first.)\n\n(well i controlled him first, i made him get here in the first place so he's mine. MINE)\n\n(hmm, how about we all have him. Ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ours)\n\nMake it stop. Please go away. \n\nThe demons all stepped forward and, with their limbs, tentacles, bodies or heads, all gently touched my face.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI walked through the street of my house, ignoring everyone and everything. My body was twitching and shuddering at each step. I was walking like a zombie.\n\nI unlocked the door to my house and almost tripped my way to the kitchen.\n\n(ladies and gentlemen, let us commence our first party)\n\n(ours)\n\n(ok so what’s the plan)\n\nI grabbed the largest knife I could find and swooped at the keys on the table with a swift motion.\n\n(let's pay the so called “boss” a visit)\n\nThe car unlocked with a click.",

        "text": " There’s a payphone in the empty lot behind my high school that still hasn’t been demolished even though it hasn’t had power in years, ‘cause nobody can be bothered to take it down until someone buys the property and builds something on it, which is never going to happen. Our town is small enough that most businesses wouldn’t bother, and even if someone living here wanted to open one, there are other empty lots in much better locations.\n\nThere is also a playground rumor that if you put a quarter in the machine, and dialed a specific number while you were alone in the booth, you would be able to talk to a spirit called Amaryllis that would grant you any ability you desired. \n\nThere were a couple caveats- You can only use the phone once in your lifetime, and you can’t change or get rid of the ability once you’ve got it. You also take on a curse that you’ll be stuck with forever, and you have no say in what it is- the spirit chooses it.\n\nGenerally speaking, the more powerful the ability you asked for, the worse the curse would be. If you wished for the ability to telekinetically move apples, your curse would be something like getting more hangnails than usual. If you wished for telekinesis in general, your curse would be something like never having anyone’s trust when it’s cold outside, or spontaneously combusting if you heard music while you used your power.\n\n“Curses come in two different flavors, Mara.”\n\nThat’s how my next door neighbor, Natasha explained it. She was three years older than I was, and I believed everything that came out of an older kid’s mouth, whether it was true or not.\n\n“You either get a curse that is unrelated to your power, and is just a general bad thing that sucks to have happen to you, or a curse that is a cost to using your power, like taking a month off your lifespan every time you use it. I got the first kind.”\n\nNatasha was the first person to tell me that she had actually *gotten* a power instead of saying that she knew someone that did. She said she wished for extremely good luck, and in exchange, she was unable to lie about anything for the rest of her life.\n\nThere wasn’t a direct way to prove it, but Natasha had won every single raffle she’d ever entered at the town’s winter and harvest festivals, found a hundred dollars in her backyard twice, and admitted to her teacher that she cheated on her test, which was enough proof for eight-year-old me, and I wanted in on it.\n\nBut I couldn’t use the phone, because you need to dial a specific number for it to work, and Natasha refused to tell me what it was. That’s also why everyone in town who believes in the rumor doesn’t immediately try to get free powers. It’s extremely hard to get the number, and most of the people who know it don’t tell you about it.\n\nThere are tons of people (mostly kids at school) that claim they know the number, or have powers, but ninety-nine percent of them are lying and all you’re gonna get is a false lead.\n\n“Look Mara, you’re too little. You’re going to pick something you’ll regret, if you can even make a decision.”\n\nAnd despite my begging, she would not budge. She never gave me the number.\n\nBut I ended up getting the number from another source several years later.\n\nWhen I started eighth grade, a new kid joined our grade. Her name was Louise, and I was in charge of showing her around school.\n\nI told her about the phone, and about all the stories I’d heard, and about a month later, she told me she used it.\n\n“Natasha gave me the number.”\n\n“Wha-Why? She never gave it to me, and I asked for it for years!”\n\nShe shrugged.\n\n“She said I’d made a good wish, so she gave it to me.”\n\n“What did you wish for?”\n\n“Not telling you.”\n\n“…So what’s your curse?”\n\n“Not telling you.”\n\n“Then there’s no way to prove you used the phone. You’re probably lying.”\n\nLouise scowled at me, cheeks turning red.\n\n“I’m not lying! I can prove it!”\n\n“How?”\n\nLouise slyly grinned.\n\n“I’ll give you the number if you buy me that cute jacket I saw at the mall last week.”\n\nThat jacket was eighty dollars, but I had birthday money to spend.\n\n“I’m not gonna buy it unless you give me the number, and it works. That shit’s expensive, I’m not wasting it on a fake number.”\n\nShe handed me a folded slip of paper.\n\n“You better keep your end of the deal.”\n\nI went to the payphone right after school, stuck a quarter in the dusty slot, and used my sleeve as a shield to cover my fingers while I touched the faded buttons.\n\nI held the phone to my ear, trying to ignore the germs that I’d get on my face from it.\n\n“Hello? Are you looking for Amaryllis?”\n\n*This is really happening.*\n\nThe voice on the phone wasn’t what I expected. I’d always imagined the spirit to have a louder, more intimidating sounding voice- she spoke much softer than I thought she would, and sounded much younger than I thought she’d sound. If I wasn’t talking through a phone with no power, I might’ve thought it was someone from school playing a prank.\n\n“Yes. I want- I want a gift from you.”\n\n“And are you aware that I must take something from you in return?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Alright. Who do I have the pleasure of giving this gift to?”\n\n“Mara Winters.”\n\n“What gift do you seek, Mara Winters?”\n\nI’d thought about this for years, and I finally had an answer.\n\n“I want the ability to see the future when I want to, unless it’s impossible to change the future. If that’s the case, I want a different gift.”\n\n“The future can be changed, yes. Are you sure that’s what you want?”\n\n“...Yes. I’m sure.”\n\n“Then I shall give you that gift, but in order to use it, you must pull out a fingernail every time you wish to take a glimpse into the future. You have to pull it all the way out. Breaking off pieces won’t work, and you can only use fully grown nails. Do you accept this trade?”\n\nI paused for a moment, weighing my options. On the one hand, pulling out a fingernail every time I use my power would be incredibly painful, and it would take forever to grow back. On the other hand, I’d have a surefire way to calm my chronic overthinking and anxieties.\n\n“...Yes.”\n\nThe call ended right after that. I showed up at school the next day with a huge smile on my face, and Louise’s new jacket.\n\nShe was the only person I told besides Natasha, who was pissed that Louise just gave me the number without asking her first.\n\nIt’s been two years since then, and I’ve only used my powers twice. The first time was to test out that they worked. I successfully predicted what I had for dinner that night, but besides that, it was pretty useless. The second time was to see if the plane I was going to go on for the annual Freshman Year Field Trip would crash, because I’m terrified of flying, and it’s better to be safe than sorry.\n\n(Spoiler alert, the plane didn’t crash.)\n\nAt least, that was until last week, when I was forced to use my power ten times.\n\nThere was this boy named William who lived a couple of towns over. He was a senior at our high school’s “rival school,” and somehow (I don’t know how) he’d gotten Amarylis’s number.\n\nHe was also a huge jerk that unironically called women “females,” called  himself an “alpha male,” and his entire Instagram was filled with shallow motivational quotes about being successful. You know, *that* kind of guy.\n\nI’d barely ever talked to him, so I was confused as hell when he showed up at my doorstep out of the blue.\n\n“...What are you doing here?”\n\n“I called up that ghost girl on the old-ass phone. I wanna see if my powers’ll actually work, or if that bitch scammed me. She said she gave you future sight, so look into my future. See if my powers are gonna work when I try them out tomorrow, so I don’t look stupid.”\n\n*Amaryllis can tell you who else used the phone? And she’ll say what powers she gave them? I should’ve asked her what she gave Louise!*\n\nHe tossed me a pair of pliers.\n\n“Also she said you’ll need these for some reason.”\n\nI glared at him for a second.\n\n“Well? C’mon, get on with it! I don’t have all day!”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Why not?!”\n\n“My curse makes using my power painful, and I don’t like you very much, so I’m not gonna do it for free. The powers work. You don’t need me to verify anything.”\n\n“You little bitch! I should just-”\n\n“I’ll do it if you pay me.”\n\n“Ugh. Fine. How much?”\n\n“Fifty bucks.”\n\n“Ten.”\n\n“Nope, Not doing that.”\n\n“Fifteen?”\n\n“No. I’ll do it for thirty. That’s my final offer, take it or fuck off.”  \n\n\nHe rummaged through his pockets, mumbling something (probably an insult) under his breath, pulled out a twenty and a ten dollar bill, and threw them at my face.\n\n“Here’s your money, now get on with it!”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nI took a deep breath, clamped the pliers to my left pinky, and pulled.\n\n“HOLY SHIT WHY DID YOU DO THAT, YOU CRAZY-”\n\n“Show me what’ll happen when William uses his power tomorrow.”\n\n*I’m standing by Shelly Smith’s locker. William approaches her.*\n\n*“The fuck do you want?”*\n\n*“Join me, my dear. Be captivated by my beauty.”*\n\n*Instantly, her eyes glazed over, and William’s thumb shrunk into his hand, vanishing completely, like it was never there.*\n\n*“Do you love me, Shelly?”*\n\n*“Of course I do. I love only you.”*\n\n*“Would you do anything for me?”*\n\n*“Of course.”*\n\nI snapped out of my vision, screaming.\n\n“YOU WISHED FOR THE POWER TO BRAINWASH PEOPLE?! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!”\n\n:”So it works. Sweet!”\n\n“Is that why you used the phone? You wanted to get a date with Shelly? That’s super creepy.”\n\n“Bold words from someone who can easily be turned into one of my puppets.”\n\n“I’m sorry, what?”\n\n“Take another look into your future. See what’ll happen if you keep pushing my buttons, so you’ll know I wasn’t bluffing.”\n\nHonestly, I thought he was, but it was better to be safe than sorry, and he’d already put the thought into my head.\n\nI yanked another fingernail off, grimacing through the pain.\n\n“Show me what’ll happen if I keep bothering him.”\n\n*I’m standing in front of my doorstep with the same glazed-over look Shelly had. William has a finger missing.*\n\n“Alright, alright! I-I can see you’re not bluffing!”\n\nWilliam grinned.\n\n“If you tell anyone else about this, anyone at all, I’ll brainwash you. And don’t think I won’t find out. I will. I guarantee it.”\n\nThen he left.\n\nMost people wouldn’t believe me if I told them what happened, and the few that I could probably couldn’t do all that much, plus I ran the risk of getting both me and them brainwashed. The bastard had me stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nSo even though I didn’t want to, I said nothing to anyone, and tried to ignore the nauseous feeling I felt in my stomach when I overheard the gossip at school the next day.\n\n“Holy shit, did you hear Shelly’s dating William?”\n\n“No way. She’s way out of his league.”\n\n“They’re a thing. For real.”\n\n*This is your fault, Mara. You let this happen, Mara. You’re just as bad as him.*\n\nIt didn’t help that practically everyone, including my friends, were talking about it, and over the next few days, there was even more gossip about William. He was suddenly the most popular kid in his school. His parents suddenly went from strict to super cool, basically letting William do whatever he wanted.\n\n*This’ll blow over eventually. Try to forget about it, Mara.*\n\nThen I got a text from an unknown number.\n\nHey. Future girl. I need another vision. Do it for free this time or I’ll wipe your mind.\n\nObviously, I knew who it was, but I had no clue how he got my number.\n\nWho gave you my phone number?\n\nThat’s not important. You doing it or not?\n\n…Fine.\n\nFacetime me.\n\nI did, and sure enough, William’s stupid smirk greeted me.\n\n“What do you want?”  \n“Jeez. You can stop with the sass. Anyways, Shelly wants to use the phone. Check to see if it’ll work or not.”\n\nI sighed, grabbed a bandaid and pliers, and pulled.\n\n“Show me what happens when Shelly uses the phone.”\n\n*Shelly sticks a quarter into the slot, staring into space with empty eyes.*\n\n*The phone rings.*\n\n*“Hello? Are you looking for Amaryllis?”*\n\n*“Yes.”*\n\n*Shelly’s voice is flat, and void of emotion.*\n\n*“Oh, hello William! Unfortunately, I can only give one gift!”*\n\n*“I am not William.”*  \n*“Ah, but you’re being controlled by him! That means you were instructed by him to do so! Sorry, but you can’t ask for gifts for other people! Goodbye!”*\n\n*She hangs up.*\n\n“It won’t work.”\n\n“Why?”  \n“You only get one gift. That’s what Amaryllis said.”  \nWilliam sighed, looking frustrated, and hung up.\n\nMy hand stung, but I had a knot in my stomach. I didn’t want to do any more favors for this douche, and I *needed* to know whether or not he was going to bother me again.\n\nI yanked out another nail.\n\n“Show me if William asks me for another favor.”  \n*I’m sitting in my room, playing a game on my computer. My phone buzzes.*\n\n*Hey, Future Girl. I need another vision. I’m throwing a party at my house, and I’m worried one of my neighbors will call the cops to complain or something.*\n\nAlright. So he *was* going to bother me again. Maybe I could block his number? Actually, yeah, why don’t I just do that? \n\nI quickly found his number and blocked it.\n\nThen again, he could just track me down and ask me at home or school or something.\n\nAnd would he be mad enough to retaliate and mind control me? I wouldn’t put it past him, and the thought had already burrowed itself into my brain, like a tiny little worm, squirming around, screaming “YOU’RE GONNA DIE, MARA.” over and over and over again. I could just un-block it right now, but what if it was the solution to all my problems and I was ignoring it?\n\nI tried to ignore it.\n\nI tried to focus on my homework.\n\nI went over to Natasha’s and played video games with her, desperately trying to ignore my intrusive thoughts.\n\nI tried reminding myself that my hand felt like it was on fire, and if I pulled off the last of my nails on that hand, it would feel even worse.\n\nBut I had to know what would happen if I left the number blocked.\n\nSo I pulled my nail off, trying to ignore the fact that having five nail beds completely exposed, only hidden by a couple of bandages was an injury that would be hard to explain away if anyone asked, and the agony I was currently in.\n\n*You can’t scream right now. Your mom will check on you, and then she’ll think you’ve gone insane.*\n\n“...S-Show…show me what’ll happen if I-I…keep William’s number blocked.”\n\n*I’m walking home from school. William’s car pulls up beside me.*\n\n*“Hey! I told you I needed a favor! Why didn’t you respond!”*\n\n*“I uh, didn’t get it.”*\n\n*“Whatever. I’m here now, and I need a vision.”*  \n\n\nSo he was going to find me in person. Great. At least he didn’t immediately mind-control me. I didn’t really want to see him in person, so I left the number unblocked, and waited for the inevitable text.\n\nWhich happened a day later, while I was making myself a snack, instead of playing on my computer like in my vision. Everything else played out the same though.\n\nI had to sacrifice another nail, which meant both of my hands hurt like hell. *Fantastic.*\n\nSo I asked if the cops interrupted William’s party, and I saw a vision of a bunch of police cars outside William’s house.\n\n“Damn it! I’ve only got four sacrifices left!”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“My curse, dumbass! I have to sacrifice body parts! I’ve only got four left to sacrifice!”\n\n“You only have four body parts left?”\n\n“SACRIFICEABLE ONES, YEAH! EVERY TIME I USE MY POWER I HAVE TO GIVE THAT STUPID GHOST BITCH SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT!  SHE STARTED WITH TAKING A FINGER OR A TOE, AND THEN SHE STARTED TAKING THINGS THAT ARE WAY MORE VITAL! SHE TOOK AN EAR AND ONE OF MY ARMS! SHE FUCKING SCAMMED ME, JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER GIRLS IN THIS TOWN!”  \n\n\n“Sounds like you should stop using your power, then.”\n\nHe angrily hung up, and for a moment I was paranoid that he was going to use his power on me, then I was like “no, he’s too worried he’s gonna lose something vital, he just said so.”\n\nAnd then my paranoia got to me, and because I am a chronic overthinker, I impulsively ripped out another nail.\n\nI was not brainwashed in the vision I saw, but I was bleeding all over the kitchen counter, so I quickly cleaned it up, bandaged my hand, and told myself I was done using my power until all of my missing nails grew back.\n\nBut then I did something stupid.\n\nWilliam decided he was going to throw the party anyway, he just made it a lot less wild than he’d planned. And he invited a bunch of people from his and my school, including me.\n\nI should’ve said I couldn’t come. But I was invited to a party with a bunch of the most popular kids in both my school and his, and there are barely any parties thrown in town. Plus, it seemed like William couldn’t use his power without taking a huge risk, and I could probably spend the whole party avoiding him- he’d be busy hanging out with all the other people he invited, right? \n\nSo I went to the party.\n\nI did one smart thing, I guess. Or maybe it was weird and paranoid. I put some bandages, and a pair of pliers in my purse before I left for the party, just in case William decided to ask for another favor.\n\nHe didn’t. But I would need them.\n\nThe party was going great for a while. I was hanging out with Louise, having a great time, and sure enough, William was so busy hanging out with other people, he barely even noticed I was there. Honestly, it was the coolest party I’d ever been to- until I heard a scream.\n\nOne of Shelly’s old friends that she’d immediately dropped once she started dating William was holding a knife to a girl’s throat. Two more people with knives were standing beside him.\n\n“Where. Are. Shelby. And. William.”\n\nEveryone panicked. Some people tried to run, but most either froze up or hid somewhere. I hid behind a counter.\n\nI was close to the window. So close, I might have had the chance to run out of it, but I wasn’t sure. \n\nFor once, I didn’t have to hide a pained scream when I pulled out one of my last three remaining nails. There was plenty of screaming covering mine up.\n\n“SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE WILLIAM AND SHELLY ARE!”\n\n“Show me what happens if I try to run.”\n\n*I dive over the counter, attempting to open the window.*\n\n*It jams as I try and open it. One of the kids with knives notices and grabs me.*\n\n*“TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE, OR I’M GONNA KILL HER TOO!”*\n\n*A knife is put to my throat. The girl they were holding hostage is on the ground, dead.*\n\n*Before anyone can say anything, the kid slashes the knife across my throat, and I immediately collapse to the floor.*\n\nI snapped out of the vision, still hidden behind the counter. The girl who’s being held hostage is still alive.\n\n“IF YOU GUYS DON’T TELL ME WHERE WILLIAM AND SHELBY ARE, I’M GOING TO KILL HER!”\n\nNobody says anything.\n\nJust as he was about to cut her throat, I found my voice, knowing that everyone else won’t.\n\n“He-He’s upstairs!”\n\nI wasn’t sure if that was true. I have no clue where they are, but I don’t want this girl to die.\n\nHe let the girl go.\n\n“You move, you die. That goes for all of you.”\n\nTwo of them started heading up the staircase.\n\n“Tamara, stay by the front door. Kill anyone that tries to leave.”\n\nI saw William and Shelly hiding in a closet by the staircase.\n\n*I gave them the wrong location.*\n\nWhich was both good and bad, because I didn’t want them to find and kill the two, (I may have hated William, but I didn’t want him *dead)* but I also didn’t want anyone to die when they found out that they weren’t upstairs.\n\nMaybe we could all ambush the one girl who was blocking the door and escape, or we could-\n\nOne of the partygoer’s voices interrupted my train of thought.\n\n“Anything you wish, William.”\n\nSomeone ran out of their hiding spot, and tried to tackle the two kids walking towards the staircase. Her eyes had that telltale glazed over look that I knew all too well by now.\n\nShe managed to tackle the one, but the other one stabbed her before she could do anything else.\n\nWilliam sent another person to try and fight them, but he spoke a bit too loudly, because they realized where he was, and rushed toward him.\n\nHe started screaming at all of the people nearby. \n\n“JOIN ME, MY DEAR! PROTECT ME FROM THEM! KEEP ME ALIVE NO MATTER WHAT! TAKE AWAY THEIR KNIVES! FIGHT THEM AND-”\n\n*Wait, did the person by the door join in on the fight? She did.*\n\nI grabbed Louise’s hand.\n\n“We might have a chance to make a break for it. Just let me see.”\n\nThe adrenaline coursing through my veins completely blocked the pain of ripping another nail out. \n\n“Show me what happens if we run.”\n\n*Louise and I run out the door, hand in hand, following the crowd of other kids who had the same idea as me.*\n\n*We run out the door, while the fight rages on in the house. Nobody stops us.*\n\n“Let’s go. Now!”\n\nWe sprint out the door. It was fifty-seven degrees outside, and I’d left my coat behind, but I’d never been more relieved to feel the cold air stinging against my skin.\n\nSome people stood by the doorway, waiting for their friends to come out. Some drove away in their cars, or call the police on their phones.\n\nI’m separated from Louise while she looks for her brother in the crowd outside. Most of them are halfway down the block by now, but I’ve frozen up in front of the house, which has gone completely silent.\n\nA group of people with glazed over eyes leave the house, carrying something. No, *someone.* A boy that I can barely recognize.\n\nHe was missing both his arms, one of his legs, an eye, an ear, and a *mouth.* His mouth is gone.\n\nAt first, I thought William was dead, but when the group passed by me, I saw his eye moving around to look at me.\n\nHe was *still alive.*\n\nThe ground rushed towards me, and everything went black.\n\n“Miss? Miss? Can you hear me? Miss?”\n\nI awoke to an EMT shaking my shoulder. My ears were ringing. She shined a light in my eye, then asked me to say the months of the year in reverse order.\n\nMy head was pounding, and my mind felt foggy. I mixed practically all of them up. The lady walked me to an ambulance.\n\n“She may have a head injury. Take her to the emergency room.”\n\nThe rest of that night was a blur, mostly due to the concussion I’d got when I collapsed, but I remember hearing someone say that four people were dead, and that William was missing.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, the doctor’s first question was about what happened to my hands.\n\n“Did you bruise all your nails when you fell into those rocks?”\n\n“I fell into rocks?”\n\n“You must’ve hurt your hands pretty badly, because most of your nail beds are exposed. They must’ve fallen off after you fainted, probably when Sonia was moving you to the ambulance, because when you got here they were all gone- minus this one, which is probably going to fall off too.”\n\n“What?”\n\nI looked at my last remaining nail. There was, indeed, a huge bruise underneath it.\n\nI learned that four people died that night. Two of those people were Shelly’s old friends. The third one had been arrested. Apparently they were furious that Shelly had completely abandoned them after years of friendship, and acted like a completely different person, and decided to get revenge.\n\nThe other two dead were the girl that William had mind-controlled to tackle the ones looking for him, and a boy who the attackers mistook for William, since he looked similar.\n\nWilliam and Shelly were missing, along with a couple of other partygoers. Not only that, but so were his parents, and a couple of his teachers, who weren’t even at the party.\n\nSuddenly, I remembered the last thing I’d saw before I passed out.\n\n*William, being carried away by all the people he brainwashed, missing so many limbs, but still alive.*\n\nI didn’t know whether or not it was real.\n\nA couple hours later, the doctors gave me the all clear to go home, telling me I’d still need to rest for a while. On the car ride home, my last remaining nail fell off.\n\n*I don’t know if this counts, since I didn’t pull it off, but I might as well try.*\n\nI whispered as quietly as I could so my parents didn’t hear.\n\n  \n“Show me if William will ever be found.”\n\n*I’m in a locked room, that appears to be a basement.*\n\n*William is hooked up to an I.V. All his glossy eyed puppets are standing around his bed, brushing his hair, or adjusting his sheets, or just tidying the room.*\n\n*He is tied to the bed he’s on.*\n\n*He can’t say anything, because his mouth is gone, but tears are falling down his one remaining eye.*\n\n*I can read the look he’s giving me, even though he’s not actually looking at me, because this is just a vision. But I can tell what he’s thinking.*\n\n*He wants someone to kill him.*\n\nI spent a couple days just…processing everything that happened. My parents booked me an appointment with a therapist as soon as I got home, and they let me take time off of school for a little bit.\n\nMy therapist recommended I take up journaling as a way to cope with things. I’ve kept most of it private, but I’m sharing this entry as a warning. If you’re going to mess with a supernatural force, make sure you understand it. Make sure you know what you’re getting into before you agree to something. If you find out where the pay phone is and decide to use it, please, please read this story before you do.\n\nRemember that every present, no matter how amazing it seems, is always surrounded with strings.",

        "text": "Okay. So I have a bunch of junk in the basement that needs to be organized. Free time is a luxury I don’t often have, but there were a few hours I could spare and decided to cash them in on this.\n\nEverything was going fine, and the minutes ticked by quite fast. It was nearing seven p.m., and most of the boxes had been rummaged through, their contents segregated into “keep” and “toss” piles. It even felt nice to see the small room appear spacious with less stuff cramped in there. I only had an hour before I had to leave for work—a late night pet sit a couple miles down the road; it’s a side hustle—so I told myself I’d go through one more box and then call it quits.\n\nThere wasn’t anything particular about the box I chose, just that it was nearest to me and not taped shut, which I thought was odd at first glance since I always tape my boxes closed, but I figured I had opened it at one point and forgot to reseal it. My brain is scrambled eggs most of the time.\n\nAs I unpacked what was inside—old stuffed animals from when I was kid, destined to move from house to house with me because I have a strange abandonment issue at the mere thought of getting rid of them—carefully putting everything into the “keep” pile, I noticed a book at the bottom of the box. The ashy hard cover was blank, no title, no author, nothing. It was strange that a book would be in a box full of toys; I wondered why I hadn’t packed it with my other books. Nonetheless, I picked it up and inspected its peculiar bare appearance, trying to remember when I had even bought it.\n\nThe pages were cream-colored, thick, not out of the ordinary for a book, and like the cover, there was no title, no author, not even a copyright statement on the inside. Curiosity kills my better judgment on a good day, so I flipped to the first page.\n\nWritten in and at the center was a two-line stanza.\n\n*Ignore the knocking at your door.*\n*Keep the light on, and it’ll stay away.*\n\nNow, I didn’t think anything of the prose. It’s a book, ya know? Stories are stories, and I’m a fan of horror anyway. What struck me was the chosen font or lack thereof. It looked more like someone had used their fingernail to engrave each letter into the paper; the lines varied in thickness, their lengths were uneven, and the ends were jagged. I ran my finger over the sentences, half-expecting there to be divots as if the words were truly carved by hand, but in spite of its rough, unsettling appearance, its surface was as smooth as the rest of the page.\n\nI followed to page two. The next stanza was written in the same font with the same format.\n\n*You’ll hear a familiar plea and scream and cry.*\n*Don’t give in.*\n\nIt continued like this, these strange, short stanzas on each page, all in the same scratchy font.\n\n*Don’t search for it.*\n*It has already found you.*\n\n*There’s no use hiding.*\n*It knows where you are.*\n\n*The day is your friend.*\n*For shadows reside only in the dark.*\n\nThen, something, faint at first, caught my ear and stopped me short of going to page six. That was when my dog started to bark.\n\nIn a rush, the book came with me on my journey upstairs, following the sound that grew louder and clearer the closer I trod. \n\nSomeone was at the door, knocking in a succession of three with a brief pause between each set.\n\nMy Yorkshire terrier, Scout, was already there, barking and growling, tail and ears erect, small body shaking.\n\nThe sound became abrasive the longer it went. I hurried over and flicked the porchlight on, but when I opened the door, the mudroom, now bathed in a yellow glow, was empty. I contemplated opening the outside door and settled on peeking through the glass. No one was there.\n\nEverything went silent.\n\nI closed the door and turned off the light. Scout had quieted, so I assumed all was well. Both she and I took leave on the couch, only my eyes were glued to the book in my hands.\n\nI went to page six.\n\n*Once you let it in, it’ll never leave.*\n*Don’t—*\n\nThe knocking arose again, and my head snapped toward the door. Scout growled.\n\nLike before, I turned on the porchlight. The knocking ceased, and when I checked the mudroom, nobody was there. This time, I went outside. I even hollered. Nobody answered. Nobody revealed themselves. I went back in, shut the door, and turned off the light. \n\nI didn’t make it back to the couch before a high-pitched whine stole my attention. It was like a dog’s whine and then a bark. I frantically scanned the living room.\n\nScout wasn’t there. She must’ve run out when I had the door open.\n\nMy heart was in my throat. I didn’t even turn the light on; I was so worried. I threw open the doors and beckoned her.\n\nThe whining stopped. I was surrounded by darkness and silence, and a shiver I couldn’t explain touched my spine. I called for Scout again, and a whine came from behind me.\n\nScout was standing in the doorway. She was inside the entire time? Did I hear someone else’s dog?\n\nSomething didn’t feel right. I ushered her back in and locked the door.\n\nBut as I did, I saw something in the corner of my eye, something standing just beyond the entrance to my roommate’s bedroom. Even in the darkness of the room, its figure was distinct, like a person…when I turned, though, nothing was there. I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me, so I shook it off and sat on the couch.\n\nMy eyes then drifted to the open book before me.\n\n*Once you let it in, it’ll never leave.*\n*Don’t close your eyes; don’t fall asleep.*\n\nThen, I watched Scout walk over to my roommate’s bedroom unprompted, stand just outside of it, and stare into the blackness before letting out a low growl.\n\nI’m terrified to check the room, but she won’t leave it. I don’t know what to do.",

        "text": "Transcribe…\n\n…At first I thought it was strange how much they look like us. You know, “Them”? My master and his people, if there is a “them”. If there is I’ve never seen them. As times gone on I don’t even really think about it anymore, I don’t think anything could shock me at this point. \n\nMy father…I think it was my father…once said: “I’ve been from one side of the Galaxy to the other, I’ve seen a lot of strange things.” Wait, I think that was Dad…it was either Dad or…A…Aisha?…there was definitely an Aisha…I can’t remember…NO it was definitely something to do with ‘father’ so it must have been Dad.\n\nBut that was me, 29 sols there, 29 sols back, the paludarium in the hull writhing with life from every biome imaginable across the known galaxy, when the ad said “Illegal, extremely illegal” they weren’t kidding, I had to dump perfectly good cargo and run more times than I can count. I wasn’t a GOOD runner per se, but the handful of times I actually made it to Centauri Station, cargo-in-hand were more than I could make at extracting Nephrite in 20 orbits back home, probably. \n\nI never knew what happened to the cargo once I handed it off, I didn’t want to know, honestly I didn’t care, and maybe that’s why I’m here, you know? Suffering…whatever the hell you call this, I remember thinking just after the crash “this is it I’m dead”. I was twisted completely around apparently, like ALL the way around, Twizzler-style, should have been fatal. I never actually saw the wound, but I could feel myself getting lighter as god knows what unceremoniously slopped out of me. It was around then I heard a wet, crunchy SLUMP and couldn’t feel my legs anymore.\n\nI don’t know how long it was actually, It could have been minutes or hours, all I remember was the smell of smoke…offal…the magenta holo-field on my hazard bracers blinking in my periphery vision, with my arms still in them…And I was a mess quite honestly, if that’s not clear enough, never take the advice that going limp in a crash landing will save you, tried it, doesn’t work. It wouldn’t have mattered if it did to be honest, being marooned beyond the Core Systems is a nailed on death sentence anyway, better to get it over quick than die slowly of exposure, drinking your own piss in a cave. \n\nThat was the first time I saw my master, sliding to-and-fro between the material universe and God knows where. Blackness…then a zap of electricity in the brain, a racing heart, metallic gurgling in my throat, an ornate archway…dragging…a marble hallway…dragging…another zap of lightning…another…a machine beeping slowly…another…rapid beeping…\n\nA beaming smile pulled across the width of his tightening thin lips, familiar eyes,  brimming with humanity. It’s really not his fault, you know? I’ve come to realise that as time’s gone on, I used to hate it down here in the tunnels, scrambling around in the dark looking for the food he leaves me, the S.M.A.R.T I’m using to transcribe this very recording shows that it’s …283 Kelvin…here in my…enclosure…\n\nIt must be daylight up in the palace then, it’s been as low as 253K, once it got to 248K. Master, finding me blue and…unresponsive, stoked the great fires. It was terrifying the first time obviously, but quite a spectacle nonetheless, fortunately that night I had perchance taken shelter in my favourite nook, by some miracle it was just deep enough into the jagged obsidian walls of my terrarium that I avoided the worst of the roiling wall of fire ripping through the winding impossible caverns. I think I maybe lost an eyebrow? \n\nBut that’s life down here really, you either boil or you freeze, my master is nothing if not a creature of extremes. I like to think of it as a dance I’ve nearly perfected now, I have my little rocky plateau, it’s only about a 40 metre (or so) climb and it’s at the very entrance of Tunnel 11, if you time when you eat right you have just enough energy to make it up there and enough energy to stay awake to watch the show, seriously finding the plateau made my life SO much easier, when he stokes those fires you want to be off ground level, pronto. \n\nSure I held it against him at first, but I think he’s doing his best, what does he know about human beings are our strange little needs and wants? He found me on a cold planet, he probably thinks we thrive in cooler temperatures, he saw me cold and unresponsive so he tried to warm me with the fires, he just doesn’t understand, but he saved me and he MEANS well. Alright I can’t quite explain the terrifying labyrinth which is otherwise completely at odds with human survival but I’m adapting, that’s what we human’s do isn’t it? Adapt? \n\nSometimes I play dead so he will take me up there with him. Satin bedsheets. Warm showers. Food that isn’t in bloody pellets…not that I’m ungrateful you understand, my master is truly benevolent. I owe my life to him and he takes care of me the best that he can.\n\nHow my friends would laugh if they\nEven thought this is where I’d end up,\nLonely, afraid, an Intergalactic house pet\nPining for the attention of my master. \n\nMum. Dad. Sorry to tell you this, but\nEarth is next, so Master says.",

I'm honestly not sure how good of an idea it is to be writing this right now, the person that locked me in here is still around, I've heard them walk by a few times, and though it's been hours it doesn't look like they plan on sleeping anytime soon.\n\nAt the very least they aren't hanging around listening for me, and I suppose if they were going to hurt me they would have done it already. I’m too on edge to sleep, and sitting here with my thoughts isn't helping. All I can really think to do is write them down, the service out here is as spotty as ever, and with my phone smashed to bits I doubt I’ll be able to call for help. I'm just lucky I found this laptop, they didn't check the room much when they threw me in here. No windows and a locking door was enough, I guess.\n\nI’ll try to get my thoughts in order here. How “ordered” I’ll end up making them? I'm not sure, but some messed up things have happened, and I feel like I'm losing my mind just stewing over them. I'll start from the beginning. I work at a remote summer camp on a lake in Ontario. It sits on a small island, way out in the wilderness just north of the Canadian border. The whole place is abandoned during the winter, but a few times every season we send someone up to check in on the place. This year, I was chosen.\n\nThe drive up was quiet, with each passing hour I saw fewer and fewer cars until I reached the turnoff onto the long road to camp. On that road I saw no one, and hours later I came down into the snowy parking lot and pulled my car into a garage on shore. I set out on foot across the frozen lake, and upon shore I went to the electrical shed to turn on the island's generator, the only source of power due to the camp's remoteness.\n\nThe moment I left the little building after starting it, I was met by the sidelong stare of a deer, standing some five or so feet away on the trail ahead of me. It isn't uncommon to see wildlife out here, but they tend to be pretty shy around people. This deer on the other hand, stood just paces away, unmoving and looking right at me. \n\nThe animal didn't seem well off. It looked mangy and malnourished. Its hide was taut against its bony frame, ribs and joints jutting out visibly. In places its fur was shed down to the bare skin, which was blotchy, and discolored. Its stare was glassy eyed, and it stood there with an awkward stance, as if struggling to hold itself upright as it peered over at me. After a mistaken breath through my nose I could tell something was seriously wrong with it.\n\nI winced when I breathed in. A fetid, sickly sweet odor filled my nostrils and made me gag on my own spit. It smelled like it was dying, like it was one missed heartbeat away from dropping off the face of the earth, and the odor was bad enough to urge me to get away from the thing. I couldn't take it, the stench made my stomach twist and I locked up as fast as possible and set out for the camps lodge where I planned to stay. \n\nThe encounter freaked me out. Of course I felt bad for it, its condition was saddening and it looked like it was in pain, but I couldn't deny that it unnerved me. Its eyes were glazed over, but at the same time they seemed to bore right into me.\n\nIf you’ve ever gotten that uncomfortable feeling of being watched, it felt just like that, except the animal doing the watching was standing right there in front of me. \n\nI know it was irrational, but after walking for a moment longer I couldn't bear the urge to check. A glance over my shoulder told me that it was still standing there, craning its neck at an odd angle to look right at me. I tried to assure myself that it was all in my head, but the feeling of its stare burrowing into me persisted as I walked up the path. Regardless, I was glad when the smell dissipated after getting farther away from it.\n\nI tried to put my worries aside and think logically. Animals get sick, it's disheartening to see but it happens. I also had stuff to do, and I focused on the work that needed to get done. After getting inside the lodge I dropped off my bags, turned on the circuit breakers and heating in the basement, and went out into the cold once again to check the place out.\n\nThings were normal around camp, the old buildings were as sturdy as ever and the few issues worth fixing wouldn't take long. Still, I felt uneasy. Even after a few rounds I couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Every slight sound spiked my heart rate, and while the deer seemed to have disappeared, or at the very least decided to stay out of sight, I caught traces of the rotting smell lingering in the air. Shivers crawled through me each time one crossed me, but no amount of nervous looking showed me their source.\n\nAdmittedly I was on edge, and resigned to the fact that I was freaking out over a mangy animal, I made my way back to my car on the mainland. I was lucky enough to be acquainted with one of the few sociable people nearby, an older man named Richard, who I met through my years working at the camp. He stayed in the area year round, and was one of the only people I talked to during my rare winter visits. \n\nI thought that catching up would help clear my head, and frankly I was still exhausted from the car ride up, not being in the mood to do any more work. I hadn't spoken to him since summer, and I wanted to talk about the happenings in the area. Especially the deer, it kept weighing on me, and I’d never seen anything like it before. Mange? Something else? It almost looked like chronic wasting disease, but I knew it was completely unheard of in the area. Regardless, if anyone around might have seen more signs of it, it would be him. \n\nAfter a short drive, I turned the corner into his lot, and my mood faltered a bit. His truck was sitting out in the open, coated in a layer of snow. It struck me as odd. I knew that he kept religiously good care of it, more so during the winter, but there it sat outside in the middle of the driveway, being unattended since at least the last snowfall.\n\nGetting out of my car I approached the stout cabin. Fresh bootprints led up to the door, so it seemed he was inside, for whatever reason leaving his truck out in the snow. I knocked on the front door once, then again, and again until my hand started to hurt. Concern grew in me, I don't know what I was worried about exactly, but I felt pushed to check in on him. I tried the knob, not expecting it to give, but to my surprise the door swung open. The inside of the cabin was dark, and upon stepping in I felt the icy air stay unrelenting around me. If he was home, he was braving the freezing temperatures inside, making no effort to heat the house.\n\nI heard the scuff of something move beside me in the darkened room. Before I could look, blunt, cold metal pressed onto my ear with enough force to jerk my head to the side. I froze up, I wasn't sure what it was, but I could make a good assumption. My words poured out before I could even think.\n\n“Richard! Fucking christ, its Daniel! Daniel from the summer camp? You know me dont you? Look I don't want any trouble, just put it down and we can-”\n\nThe person beside me pulled back the hammer on what I could now be sure was a gun. They spoke in a cold, commanding tone, pressing the weapon harder into the side of my head. “Stop. Calm down and stay still, you follow my instructions and you won't get hurt, understand?”  It sounded like a woman's voice, and whoever it was, it certainly wasn't Richard. I gave a shaking nod.\n\n“Good. You got an ID on you?” She said.\n\n“I do, i can give you my wallet if you want, just, please, I don't want any trouble.\"\n\n\"Neither do I, give it to me and we'll see if you came looking for it.\"\n\n\"The fuck is that supposed to- nevermind, forget it. Here \" I said, pulling it out of my back pocket and pointing my hand out behind me. The wallet left my hand, and a moment later the gun left my neck. I had the urge to bolt out the door, but almost on cue she said, \"Try anything and I drop you. Sit tight for a second.\"\n\nAfter a moment the barrel pressed against my neck again. \"I'm gonna ask you a few questions. You answer them right and you go home, you don't, and you stay here… Figuratively speaking.\"\n\n\"Okay I- I think I understand what you're saying.\"\n\n\"Good. First, what is your full name, date of birth, and height?\"\n\n\"Right, okay. My full name is Daniel Girard Mayfield, born October fourth 1994, and I'm, well shit I don't know, a hundred eighty centimeters? I mean it doesn't have to be exact right? You aren't going to shoot me if i'm off a few- please I really don't-\"\n\n\"Okay, chill. Chill out and shut your mouth. You're fine, I don't expect you to have your exact height memorized. Next I want to know what you're doing out here. Both in general and why you're snooping around this house.\"\n\nLip quivering, I tried to answer. \"Look, please I just work out here, I work at a summer camp, it's empty now but I'm here to check up on it, so here I am. And why Im here? I'm looking for my friend. He lives here, Richard Anderson, if you know him, or if you're his kid, or something. I haven't seen him in months and I'm worried.\"\n\nShe let out a long sigh, and the pressure against my neck dropped away before she spoke. \"Look, I'm sorry, but I don't know your friend. I didn't talk to a Richard when I bought this place last month, never saw him before or after then. I wish I could help you but I can't, and regardless, you can't stick around for it if I could. You need to get in your car and go home.\"\n\n\"Woah, what? Look I just have to figure out what's going on, you said you bought the place? Can I at least turn and talk to you face to face-\"\n\n\"No. What you have to do is leave, turn around and walk to your car. Dont turn my way when you do.\"\n\n\"Please, don't leave me in the dark here, he's old, and if you bought this house, well, I dont know but hes not the type to sell he has a choice, and-\" still trying for answers, I was cut off again by the gun to my head.\n\n\"Turn around. Walk. I'm sorry, truly, but I cant help you. You need to leave now, I won't ask again.\"\n\nDefeated, scared and at a loss for words, I relented. I turned and left. The moment I crossed onto the porch the door slammed shut behind me.\n\nHalfway to my car I turned my head to look at the place, and was about to keep walking when something caught my eye. A dark shape lingered in the shadows between the garage and cabin, I squinted to make it out but it moved away and out of view before I could place it. An animal, maybe? A person? Just a trick of the light? I didn't care.\n\nAll I wanted was to get back, pack my things and go home. I didn't want to spend a minute that wasn't necessary being around. I figured I could ask around, figure things out elsewhere, all that mattered was getting home. Sadly, the forces of nature had other plans.\n\nThe temperature had been dropping since I first arrived, and after being above freezing the entire day before then, the roads were slick. On the way to camp I struggled to come to a stop even going ten under the limit, sliding out onto the road. With high winds now blowing down from the north, the sun setting fast, and temperatures still plummeting, I didn't feel safe driving home in the dark. All the fear of getting shot aside, dying of hypothermia in a ditch on the side of the road would be worse.\n\nI couldnt get any service to check now, but earlier the radar showed good weather the next day. I decided to leave in the morning rather than risking the icy roads. I wasn't happy about it, I somehow felt stupid for my decisions, though I was unsure of how else I could have acted. Reluctantly, I set myself to working before settling in for the night, trying to distract myself from my growing anxiety.\n\nBefore I knew it the sun had set, blanketing the island in inky darkness. I was washing up after a hasty dinner when a loud thud echoed from somewhere across the building. Walking through the mess hall and into the main room, nothing looked out of place. Something falling wasn't out of the question, one of the old mounted deer heads had detached from the wall once and nearly impaled a counselor, so I was on the lookout for something like that.\n\nFinding nothing, I was about to give up and go back to my business when I heard another thud at the front door. After another moment a sharp rapping rang out from the door and my mind jumped to the stranger from earlier. Was she out there looking for me? I really shouldn't have said anything about where I worked, this was the only summer camp around, and it wasn't exactly hidden.\n\nNot wanting to be seen, I pulled back the curtain as little as I could and took a cautious peek out of the window. Whoever it was seemed to be a man, and werent obviously armed. They were dressed in ragged day clothes, jeans and a flannel shirt, and were a head shorter than me. Their face was obscured by a scarf, wrapped all around their head. \n\nThey weren't dressed for the weather, and their beat up clothes wouldn't help against the subzero temperatures outside. My worry for their safety overtook, and I opened the door a crack, allowing the light from inside to spill out onto them. The wind was blowing fast outside and I was hit by a blast of cold air. “You alright out there? Not a good idea to be out wandering around in the cold, you lost or something?”\n\nLeaning against the doorframe, head hung low, the man spoke, his voice hoarse and low as if he had something caught in his throat. “Ugh, a bit. Thank Christ someones here, was starting to worry I’d keel over before I found shelter. You mind if I come in? Feels like my face is about to fall off out here.”\n\nOpening the door wider I gestured toward the couch. “Come in, sit down, please. How long were you out there?\n\nEntering the lodge he slumped down, sinking into the couch and clearing his throat a few times. I stood next to him, and was hit by a wave of some horrible stench. He smelled awful, like he’d just crawled out of a damn dumpster. I swallowed hard, pushing away my apprehensions. “You don't look too good, do you need help, should I call someone?”\n\nWaving a dismissive hand he said, “No no no, you don't need to call anyone, just gotta catch my breath, warm up a bit.” He looked up at me and spoke again. “And really, I'm not sure how long I was out there, but,” He paused, his glassy, tired eyes seeming to focus on me.\n\n“Wait, Daniel? That you kid? Hell, I could hardly see you through the cloth. Hold on- Let me just-” Struggling, he pulled the scarf from around his head to reveal his sallow, beaten face. He was covered in bruises and cuts, his nose a dark, purplish black, frostbitten beyond belief. Pulling myself out of my shock at the man's injuries and smell, I saw the battered face of Richard. \n\nMy neighbor Richard. My friend Richard. The same man who I'd meant to meet, but whose house was inhabited by a gun toting lunatic. The lunatic that said she’d never seen him before. The lunatic that wanted me gone, bad enough to threaten me at gunpoint. I assumed he'd moved, sold the place, passed even and had it sold by the inheritor, but he sat right before me, looking and smelling like he just dragged himself out of hell. He didn't sound like himself at first, voice rough and full of phlegm, but it was him.\n\nI just stood there, mouth agape trying to form the words. “Richard- what? What? The hell are you doing out here? There's someone in your house and your- your out wandering in the damn woods? And your face! Fuck me, how long were you out there? Your nose is black, Richard! I need to call you an ambulance right now-”\n\n“Woah there kid, slow down now. Look, there's no need to get all worked up.” He said.\n\n“Slow down? No way in hell Richard, you need to tell me what happened. Why are you out here? I had a real nerve wracking interaction with someone, in your own damn house mind you, and to be honest I'm worried for the both of us. The hell happened to you?”\n\nHe sat for a while before speaking, staring at nothing and appearing deep in thought. “Okay, alright. I’ll try but it's all a bit foggy. I remember, well I remember waking up to something, a noise, a crash I think. Middle of the night, something, I thought something fell. Went to check, next thing I remember is, that's right, she pulled a gun, beat me, I blacked out and woke up in a ditch covered in snow, head hurting something awful. Yesterday, I think. The day before? Hell, I don't know, kid, it's all a mess. I can't think straight.” He said, slumping back on the couch.\n\n“Richard I’ll call you an ambulance, call the police, get you the hell out of here. You'll be okay. I'll call right now, get you to a hospital and get your damn house back.”\n\nI reached into my pocket to pull out my phone, when his hand shot from his side and latched to my wrist in an icy, iron grip. “Wait. Daniel look, that can wait, okay? Could you get me something first?”\n\n“Right, sure, of course. What do you need?”\n\n“I just gotta warm up a bit more, you got a heater? Could start a fire maybe?” \n\nWe did have a few old space heaters stored in the basement somewhere, it’d be easier than getting a fire going. “Right, yeah a heater. I can get that. Just sit tight and I’ll be right back.”\n\nHe released his grasp on my wrist. His outstretched hand quivered, the fingers had a tinge of blackened skin on them as well. The sight sprung me into action, I rushed to the kitchen and headed down the basement stairs to get everything.\n\nI was a few minutes into rummaging through old boxes and shelves when I heard a long creak from the basement stairs. Turning, I saw that Richard had stopped dead in his tracks a few steps from the bottom, staring at me.\n\n“Richard? You alright?”\n\n“Uh, Right I,” He paused, staring off for a second. “I thought maybe I could call the police, to make things faster. Just give me your phone and I can call.” \n\nI could only shake my head. “Richard, it's fine. Go back upstairs, I can call okay? You need to rest, get the cold out of your bones. Go lay down.”\n\nHe stood there for a moment longer, staring at me before grumbling and going back upstairs. After finding what I was looking for, I headed back up into the kitchen towards the main room, carrying a bundle of blankets and supplies for him, calling out as I went. “Richard, I’ll need to soak that frostbite before I put any heat on it, if I just hit you with the heater you’ll get hurt even more. I've got a first aid kit here so I can-'' The room was empty. “Hey? Where’d you go? Richard?”  \n\nI was about to start searching for him when a cold draft of air hit me. Peering down the dark hallway at the other end of the room, I saw that the back door was wide open. Worried, I approached. I was relieved to see that no footprints had been left in the snow outside, meaning he was still in the house somewhere. I assumed he was still confused from the cold, likely hypothermic and not thinking clearly. I went to close the back door, but the groan of old hinges echoed from behind, halting me. Slowly turning, I called out into the darkened room opposite the open backdoor. \"Richard? You there?\" \n\nHad the wind blown it open? The air didnt feel that strong but the door opened by itself. Eyes straining, I peered through the doorway. The shadows in the room didn't feel empty, and reaching behind me, feeling for the switch by the back door, I flooded the hall with light. \n\nRichard stood in the room, a few feet back from the doorway, leering at me. The light from the hall cast him in an odd way, accentuating his disheveled features. The light should have caught his eyes, reflecting off them, but they held a dull, shineless look, like all the light was just lost.\n\nTaking a long, worried breath in, I was once again hit by his damn smell. Wracked by a wave of some hateful, rot tinged odor, I retched. Stepping back and swallowing hard in an effort to keep down the bile welling up, I spoke through gritted teeth. “Richard? You alright?”\n\nHis chapped lips twisted upwards into a slight grin. “Why don't you turn around and close that door, Daniel? It's real cold out there.”\n\n“Richard you’re hypothermic, you said it yourself you're not thinking straight. Go lay down.” My heart pounded, something about the look on his face disconcerted me in a way that I couldn't place. He took a step forward into the doorway. \n\n“Turn around and close the door, Daniel, you wouldn't want to let the cold in would you? Just turn around.”\n\nI reached for my coat pocket, not breaking my gaze. “I’m gonna call you an ambulance Richard, just calm down, you're delirious. I'm gonna to get you some help.” My eyes left him for a split second to unlock my phone, and when I did, he lunged, catching me by surprise and tackling me backwards out of the open door. The phone flew from my hand and my head slammed back, cracking against the frozen ground. A sharp wave of pain shot through my skull and my vision flashed white before my eyes.\n\nI made a feeble attempt to scramble backwards, but he pinned me to the ground, knees digging into my stomach knocking the wind out of my lungs. Drawing back, he layed a single, hard punch into the side of my face, breaking the little composure I had left. Leaving me helpless on the ground, head spinning and ears ringing, he sat up, peering at me with a cocked head.\n\nHe dug around with his hand in the snow, his chap lipped grin growing wider as he appeared to find what he was looking for. He waved my phone in front of my face, then gripped it with both hands and bent it in half before throwing it off into the woods. \n\nStill braced against me, he spoke with a sneer. “I thought you’d put up more of a fight than that. Looks like it was a good idea to let you tire yourself out before I showed up, huh? Quite the hard worker, aren't you? You’ll make a good addition.”\n\n“Wha- what the fuck are you talking about? Richard what is this?” I sputtered, words slurring on the blood pooling in my mouth as I tried to speak.\n\nHis grin widened, baring a set of blackened, grimy teeth before speaking. “You keep calling me that name. I thought you’d remember your own friends way of talking, pick up on it, but I guess my little show held up pretty well. Lay on the pity, act all sad, and cold, and hurt, and everyone lets their guard down.”\n\nLeaning forward, he placed both hands in a firm hold on my neck. His weight shifted, putting his entire body into the chokehold. I grasped at his wrists, trying with everything I could to get him off me, but the pressure on my throat was unrelenting.\n\n“Don't struggle, there's no point in fighting this, all the adrenaline in the world couldn't save you now. Let go Daniel, you'll be in a better place soon.” He said, spitting his words, forcing his weight down even harder.\n\nMy head swam, but I still fought, using every ounce of force I had in an attempt to get the psychotic assailant off.\n\nOver the sound of my own pounding heart I heard something in the distance. A low, droning growl met my ears, and it seemed to catch my attackers attention as well. He looked away, staring off into the night, never losing the grip on my neck.\n\n“Sounds like an engine, maybe someones out there, hm? No matter, no ones coming for you Daniel, just give up. Let go.” \n\nEvery passing second was a herculean effort. My vision began to blur, each heartbeat sending a painful throb through my head. I couldn't keep fighting, I felt myself getting weaker each moment and every muscle in my body wanted to give up. I nearly did, when something caught my eye.\n\nA light, somewhere off in the woods, shone through the trees. The sound of the engine grew louder, the light growing brighter along with it. There was someone out there, and to my relief, someone coming this way.\n\nPushed on by the hope of rescue, I kept up my fight, just managing to remain conscious. The light grew nearer, the dark shadows of trees shifting as it moved. For a second, the noise of the engine stopped, before picking up again, louder, coming closer.\n\n“Agh, damnit. Guess I was wrong then, huh?” He said, grip loosening slightly as he turned to look at the source of the light. “Now who might that be? Sit tight, you won't get far if you try to run.” The death grip on my throat loosened, and at last he let go, standing up to look off into the woods.\n\nThe engine had stopped again, and, straining my aching neck upwards, I could see a snowmobile or something had parked a ways away. A figure dismounted and approached, and while the intense beam of the headlights cast them in a silhouette, blinding me to their features, I could see them draw a pistol, aiming it towards Richard.\n\nI almost expected him to rush the person, but instead he started pleading. “Don't shoot! Please, I need help, this man tried to attack me, I got the best of him but you have to help. He's lost his mind, went nuts on me and-”\n\nHe didn't have time to finish, an ear splitting crack along with a blinding flash of light erupted from the figure and stopped him dead in his tracks. \n\nHe staggered backwards, losing his footing and landing next to me in the snow. Crunching footsteps approached, the figure coming into the lodge's light. They were clad in heavy duty winter clothing, face obscured by a mask, but Richard obviously recognized them.\n\n\"That wasn't very nice,\" He said, sitting up slightly and feeling around at the wound on his chest. \"Should've guessed it'd be you sticking your nose in my business again. Y'know, you're starting to become a bit of a nuisance.\"\n\nThe figure trained their gun on him again. \"Glad to hear it.\" They said, before another deafening gunshot split through the air, silencing him once and for all.\n\nFlecks of something hot splattered across my face, and the lifeless body of Richard slumped on the ground beside me. The smell of rot grew unbearable, permeating over everything, and I felt on the verge of passing out. \n\nBefore I could even begin to collect myself, a gloved hand gripped my collar and hoisted me up onto my shaky feet, and the barrel of a gun. They spoke again, almost shouting in my face. I could recognize the voice, being that of the stranger from earlier, and like at Richard's cabin their words were accompanied by the pressure of a gun to my head.\n\n“What did he do? I saw him choking you but that's all I saw. Tell me what happened, now.” They said, twisting the barrel into my jaw.\n\nI tried to speak, I wanted to, and I had a thousand things to say but none of them came out. I just stammered, my thoughts muddled by the pain, and the smell, and the ringing in my ears.\n\n“I dont- I cant- you- you fucking shot him, and- and he, he tried- he was trying to kill me, like nothing. Lost his mind like nothing, or- or, fuck me i dont know. I dont know whats happening. Please, I just dont- I dont- I…” The damn smell kept distracting me, and I could feel the presence of the body at my feet. \n\nI tried not to look, I didn't want to, but I couldn't stop myself from glancing down at his lifeless body. The gaping wound on his head oozed, well, something. It wasn't blood, whatever it was. The harsh headlight out as some kind of dark, black substance seeping out into the snow. I couldn't take it anymore, the complete blur of events, accompanied with the endless awful smell, I just couldn't take it. I retched, heaving the contents of my stomach out onto the ground, onto both of our shoes. The gun dropped from my neck as they stepped back, which was relieving, but it didn't help, my head still swam in a slurry of pain and disgust. I just let go, slumping down onto my knees on the ground.\n\nI guess I assumed that would be it, I was going to be shot dead right there, but the stranger just took a long breath in before speaking again. “How did he attack you? You need to tell me what he did”\n\nI couldn't even talk, I just groaned and looked at the ground, trying to keep my eyes off the corpse beside me. The stranger sighed, and spoke, their voice softening slightly. “Okay, get up. Lets get you inside, get you cleaned up, then you can talk. Up.”\n\nI peered up, at their outstretched hand reaching down towards me. I didn't know what else to do, so I took it, and was once again lifted up onto my feet. Inside I managed to scrub the flecks of black stuff off my face, before sinking down into an old chair. They stood a few feet away, looking down at me.\n\n“Alright, phone, wallet, keys. Set them on the table if you have them. Then you need to answer my question, how did he attack you?”\n\nI sat for a while, trying to collect myself before I drew my wallet and keys and put them on the table in front of me, but when I went for my phone I remembered that it was ruined and thrown off in the woods.\n\n“He- Well he threw me to the ground, hit me, choked me. Would’ve killed me if he didn't stop. I dont even have my phone, he broke it and threw it off into the snow somewhere.”\n\n“Did he break the skin when he attacked you? Transfer any bodily fluids to you? Did anything get in your mouth? Your eyes? Your nose?\n\n“I don't think- I mean, why? I don't think any of that happened but what does that matter? Seems like you know something I dont and Id love an explanation.\" I said, looking up. They just shook their head.\n\n“Doesn't matter, if you don't remember it happening then there's nothing else to do. Stay here, Ill be right back.” They said, before swiping the keys off the table and disappearing into the lodge. After a few minutes they returned.\n\n“Up. Follow me.” They said, and again I obliged, not being in any real position to object. They led me to one of the smaller rooms in the building, lined with shelves and dusty furniture. I was ushered in, the door locked behind me, and I leaned against the far wall, allowing myself to slide down to sit. A little while later they opened the door to throw in an old sleeping bag and pillow, instructing me to “Keep back from the door if I wanted to keep my head.”\n\nAnd here I am, writing this. She saved my life I suppose, but i dont feel good about any of this. I guess I’ve gotten everything that happened down, it's still a blur, but here it is. If I'm alive to speak upon it further, I will, but then again I highly doubt this'll reach anyone. I tried sending it out once and it buffered for half an hour, so i just wracked my brains and added more, well see what happens when I leave it overnight. Im tired, scared, confused, and my fucking neck hurts. Wish me luck.",

        "text": "When I woke up I didn't have a mouth.\n\nI ran to my mom's room and she started screaming. I wanted to scream too, but I couldn't. At the hospital, the doctors were very confused. They took all kinds of x-rays and scans. My mom wanted them to just cut me a new mouth, but they said it wasn't that simple.\n\nThey kept me there for a few days, but aside from not having a mouth, I was fine. I didn't have to eat anymore. Somehow, I just never got hungry. The doctors did everything they could to figure out what happened to my mouth, but after a few days it seemed like they were more scared of why I wasn't hungry.\n\nAfter those few days in the hospital they sent me home. Mom said the insurance wouldn't pay for it anymore. I was still confused, but I thought the best thing to do was to just move on. Mom even seemed to be feeling a little better. On the car ride home she made a joke about having one less mouth to feed. I wanted to laugh at it.\n\nGoing back to school was tough. Even my friends shied away from me, so I wore a mask to cover where my mouth used to be. Even then, I could hear people talking about me behind my back. I carried around a little whiteboard to write things on, but it wasn't as fast as talking. I tried to focus on my classes, but everything was just harder. Obviously I had to drop my public speaking class.\n\nI stopped eating lunch with my friends and would go to the library to read. It was just too awkward to sit around with everyone else eating. Even when people did talk to me, it seemed like when they weren’t asking about my mouth, they were thinking about it.\n\nIt was the same thing at home. My mom and I used to eat dinner together every night, but now I just sat and watched TV while she ate. A few times at first she’d forget and cook me something too. She'd just apologize and put it in the fridge. I didn't even used to like her cooking, but those days I'd have done anything for just one bite.\n\nI tried to spend time with her anyway, but eventually I decided to spend more time out of the house. Being around anybody just felt weird. At least if I wasn't there they wouldn't have to think about my weird non-mouth situation.\n\nI ended up going on long walks through the woods. I'd leave a note saying I was sleeping over at a friend's house and then just start walking out past where the streets ended, into the trees. Sometimes on weekends I'd even keep walking into the night and the next morning before I got home. I didn't seem to run out of energy or get tired, probably as a side effect of not having to eat. I still slept, at least back then.\n\nWhen I was able to get away from other people and just walk into the stillness of nature was really when I was happiest. At least there my silence wasn't strange. I'd come across deer and have conversations in subtle gestures and twigs snapped underfoot. Even after the sun went down, I didn't stop walking. I carried a flashlight with me at first but after a few weeks I didn't need it.\n\nOne weekend, I decided to walk to the next town over just to see if I could. I spent all night walking through the dark forest, avoiding the trails and roads. As the sun was coming up I made it to the edge of town, and walked down the empty roads as the town started to wake up. I wondered what I could do now that I was here. The few times I had been to this town had been with my mom, when we had stopped at a small local coffee shop.\n\nI made it all the way to the door before I thought about what I was doing. I no longer had a way of relieving those memories, not even of relating to another person about it. I just stood there looking in through the glass for a few moments and left.\n\nI didn’t go back home after that.  I just walked off into the forest again, away from the lights and noise of the city and into the accepting stillness of the woods. Free from fatigue or direction, I walked between the trees like a shadow. My body changed further as if to approve my decision to flee. It was subtle at first, my legs grew longer to let me step over logs and streams, while the rest of my body became better at seeing and moving at night. I haven’t looked in a mirror in a while, but the last time I came across a hiker they turned and fled.\n\nI can see the city lights from the hilltop, and I turned my phone back on for the last time to post this, just in case anyone wanted to know how my story ended. I’m fine with my 15 minutes of fame being on the side of a milk carton. I don’t know if I could have it any other way.\n\nIt’s quiet where I am now. I go down to the edges sometimes, the places where the woods and towns tentatively touch. I can’t go back over that border. It’s not a world I know anymore. But here in the safe still solitude of the trees I can embrace what was always within me. Maybe that’s worth not going back.",

        "text": "\\*WARNING: mentions of racism and violence\\*\n\nPap and I had a schedule back then. We woke early, before the sun rose, and crept over to Long Creek with the barrels and the water without saying a word to each other. I knew he had always wished for a son. He knew I had always wished for a mother. Instead, we were stuck with each other, and that was just the way things were. We made due.\n\nNow, they have shows on the History Channel about it like it isn't a crime. Now, you can find it in the liquor store or at beach restaurants at the bar for 13.99. When I was coming up though, moonshine was dark business, and it was a serious thing to get caught doing, but it was a serious thing to get foreclosed on, too, and Pap had the blood in him. Yes, that old South Carolina blood that ties you the land and the water and all the bad things your ancestors done. \n\nSo we made moonshine in the small hours of the morning in the woods by Long Creek, me and Pap. We'd work until it was time for me to walk back to the trail and catch the bus to school, and Pap would work a few more hours and then trudge back home, and I'd always check the barrels when the bus dropped me off in the afternoon. My teachers in school were surprised I did good in chemistry (on account of I was pretty mediocre in all other subjects) but moonshine is pure science. You boil the mash, you let it sit, you trim the foreshots. One wrong step and you blow yourself up, make your neighbors blind. I saw myself as a kind of doctor then, looking out for the drunks of my town. I was a scientist.\n\nSo on that May afternoon, cooler than it should've been that time of year, it was a sense of duty that lead me towards Long Creek when the bus dropped me off. I tossed my backpack into the moss at the bottom of the raspberry bush about twenty steps into the woods, for lighter weight. Like I'd done all my life, I let the rush and gurgle of the creek guide me.\n\nThey say lots of things about Long Creek, and they did even then. Generations back, they've been saying that the creek runs with blood and bones and bad intentions. Before the Civil War, the place was a slave plantation, run by a man named Jack Long. He had 45 slaves. Jack Long had 45 human beings who belonged to him, and now, there's no such thing as a good slave owner but Jack long was a *mean* slave owner. The legend had it that he worked a pregnant woman named Addie Rae and she started to go into labor, and when she asked to go inside and have her baby, he had the overseer whip her so she and her baby both died, from infection, a few days later. \n\nI thought about that often as I walked along the water- just her and her baby, wailing to death in fever.\n\nSo they say that the ghost of Addie Rae and her baby haunted the area. They say it was her that set fire to the plantation, the fire that killed Jack Long and his family, but not a single slave. They say it was her who kept the soil useless for centuries after, who let the land loose back to the woods, and roamed up and down the creek looking for revenge ever since. This is why I walked along, a 13 year-old southern girl gone to check on the mash, and thought over and over \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. This is your creek. This is Addie Rae Creek.\"\n\nAt the still, I checked the mash. I checked it by smelling...that's how the real shiners know if it's coming along or not. Of course the smell makes your head spin and your eyes water, but it had to be done. I was about to throw the tarp over the barrel and head back to Pap and the cabin, when I heard a sound in the woods that didn't belong. \n\nIt was a moan, like someone dying.\n\nI jumped, pulled the tarp down, wary of cops. When I looked out over the black creek water though, there was no cop. None of the kids had followed me with nosy intentions from the bus either. I felt a cold wind go up the back of my neck, and thought of Addie Rae. Her baby.\n\nI didn't see anybody, but the water in the creek right in front of me was going around something. You know how it does when somebody's standing in the water? Makes two forked paths around the person's legs, then keeps running. Well that's how it went, right there in front of me, even splashing up a bit like the water was hitting something solid, only nobody was there.\n\nWith wide eyes, I left the still and started to walk back towards the road, a 15 minute walk through the woods. As soon as I turned my back, I heard the water splash up behind me, the unmistakeable sound of something large and lumbering moving through the stream. \n\nI turned around, mouth hung open and ready to spit threats and curses, to warn whoever this was that my Daddy'd come after them with his shotgun and that this was *our* still, but nobody was there. The water run in two paths as if around two legs again, a few steps from where it was before.\n\nNow I was scared. I'm not ashamed to admit it, though I stood in front of burning stills and poisonous fumes and angry rattlesnakes many a time without fear. *This* was what scared me. The evil that lived on this land.\n\nAnother thing they say about Long Creek is that it wasn't Addie Rae that started the haunting. Some people say Jack Long was only so mean because he was possessed by a spirit, the likes of which comes up from the ground and takes a hold of your holy soul. Way back before the Longs every set up a plantation on this land to work humans to death on, it all belonged to the Waccamaw people. When the white men came, they got into conflict with the natives over the creek and its fresh water supply, and the white men snuck in on them in the middle of the night and slaughtered everyone they could find. They say the Waccamaw left a curse on the land, in revenge. They say the men who built the house that would one day be Jack Long's built it right on a sacred burial ground, upsetting the spirits.\n\nAll these things I remember thinking as I stood frozen and watched the two forked spots in the water move closer to me, step, by step, by step.\n\nI started to run. The only way I knew to get back was to follow the creek, so I stuck with the water in sight and bolted as the thing splashed behind me to give chase. Fifteen minutes, but closer to ten if I really sprinted. I remember the primal sound of my breath huffing through the air, the way my clothes hung heavy on my skin. \n\nAbout five minutes in, I felt something heavy and solid collide with my back and knock me down. It made a feral, growling sound, then rolled towards the creek with me in its grip. The way it met with the ground sounded like bones smacking together, or antlers hanging on a string in a souvenir shop, clicka-clattering against each other. The parts that touched my skin were dry as sun-baked rocks, no sign that it had been in the water, and hot like pokers.\n\nI screamed and put my hands up to claw at the thing, to pull it around so I could at least see its face, but it was powerful. It dragged me easily to the banks and under the rushing black water of Long Creek, and I caught a glimpse of gray fingers, long and skinny as string beans, wrapping around my upper arms.\n\nBut now my mouth was underwater and I couldn't make any sound when I screamed. I could only let up bubbles, and those were all I saw in the murky darkness, because everything else was broke-up plants and the mud that got kicked up by my frantic kicks, and its hooves.\n\nI started to pray. That's what we southern girls do when we're in trouble, only I didn't pray to Jesus or the Virgin Mary or the Holy Ghost - I prayed to Addie Rae.\n\nPlease, I thought. Please help me. I'm sorry about you and your baby. I'm so sorry for what they done to you. Please don't let it kill me.\n\nAnd I fought, because that's also what southern girls do when we're in trouble. I fought so hard that I felt my ring finger snap as it clawed at the deformed hands that held me under, and I managed to push up against it, just enough to shimmy my shoulders back and arch my head up so it broke the surface of the water. The stream roared in my ears too loudly to make out anything that came from its mouth- opened too wide like a snake swallowing its prey -other than a constant clicking and chattering like the sound that a swam of insects makes when it rushes by too close to your ear.\n\nIts eyes were just sockets, flesh colored and smooth, like it had just been born without the rest of them. On its head, it had stringy black hair that had patches missing, and its breath in my mouth had the sweet, cloying smell of rotting flesh. The teeth were long and yellow, but thin, like hairs. Thousands of little hairs. When it saw that I saw it, it leaned in close and set those hairy teeth close to me so that I gagged at the rotting flesh stench of it.\n\n\"You're late for the harvest,\" it hissed, in its clicking insect voice.\n\nIt pushed me under again but I was facing up now, looking at it and the yellow threads spilling grotesquely from its mouth, the way its hair fell over its shoulders in greasy strings. As I watched, the hairs came out of his mouth and fell into the water and turned into worms, I swear to you, worms. The worms moved towards my eyes in a writhing mass, flooded into my open, screaming mouth, and I thought I was a goner, another victim of this awful land and its worse water, until another pair of hands grabbed me from under my arms and pulled me up.\n\nThese hands were wet. They were cold. These were creek hands.\n\nI coughed out the worms on the banks where the hands left me and screamed...and screamed and screamed and screamed. I scratched at my face to get the worms off, to get that stench off. When I finally got the nerve, I looked up and saw the White monster shielding its face and screaming a chorus of clicks and buzzes into the May afternoon. Its skin was dusting off in clouds, falling back into the stream and getting swept away from me until it was nothing but a cloud of gnats in the South Carolina air. The Black water saved me.\n\nAcross the creek, a woman stood with her nostrils flared and a bloodied rag pulled over her chest. She had a baby bundled in a cloth over her shoulder, sleeping peacefully with his tiny hands pulling at the black coils of his mother's hair. \n\nI took a long sip of the black water of the stream to clear my gullet of the worms, then looked up again to make sure she was still there. She was, standing at the banks of Long Creek with her hard stare. \n\n\"Run child,\" she told me, so I did. I got up and ran and drank a half bottle of my Daddy's finished moonshine from the shed out back when I came home, and I never set foot in those woods again.",

        "text": " \n\n\" I dunno Chris, eldritch abominations are kind of old hat at this point \" \n\nMy brother Terry had said after reading over a rough draft of the latest story I was writing. His words stung more than I think he intended them to because though I wouldn't admit it outright, I knew that they were true. \n\n\"Oh, come on Terry! I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I sit down to write.\" \n\nI had huffed back at him somewhat annoyed.\n\n\"True, but stories with big, creepy, indefinable entities are just so… overdone. Lovecraft cornered that market decades ago, and the internet is absolutely saturated with stories like that.\" \n\n\"Well what kind of creatures do you think I should write about?\" \n\n\"What about Vampires?\" \n\nI could not contain my disappointed sigh at that suggestion. \n\n\" Vampires are probably the most overdone monsters in the genre and besides, they aren't actually scary because everyone knows their weaknesses.\" \n\n\"So? Why does that matter?\" \n\n\"It matters because if the audience knows the monster's weakness, then they gain a sense of control over it, and any sense of fear evaporates. The essence of a good horror story is a lack of control.\"  \n\nI said, sounding almost like a professor giving a lecture. \n\nTerry threw up his hands in an overly exaggerated expression of defeat \n\n\" If you say so, Maestro.\" \n\nI didn't want to come off as a conceited dick head that couldn't take criticism so I decided to concede that he did have a point. \n\n“ Look, they might be old hat, but they are easy to write about, and that works for me right now. I feel like I’m in a rut creatively. I just can’t seem to think of anything to write about like I used to, and everything I do write just feels so bland and unoriginal. I end up hating it before I get half-way down the page.” \n\nI  said, sounding more fatigued than I had meant to, I pressed my head into my arms that lay folded on my writing desk in my less than tidy room in the two-story house Terry and I lived in with our parents and younger sister. \n\nTerry’s expression said that he wanted to comfort me, but wasn’t quite sure what to say. After a moment or so of uncomfortable silence however, he did manage to think up some sincere sounding words of encouragement. \n\n“ I think you’re just being too much of a perfectionist Chris. Like you said, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time you sit down to write, you just have to write what feels correct to you. Don’t write to please an audience, write to express yourself and remember what Mr. Talbot used to say.” \n\nTerry’s mention of the creative writing teacher we both shared in high school caused a wave of nostalgia to wash over me as I recalled the words that the gentle old man repeated to us at every opportunity like it was his personal catch phrase. \n\n“ There are no original stories, only original ways to tell them.” \n\nI mumbled aloud. Terry smiled in agreement as he got up from where he sat on my bed and made his way to my bedroom door, glancing back over his shoulder at me and saying \n\n“ I’m gonna go make something to eat and I’ll be back up in a bit man, take a break if you need to and don’t beat yourself up so much, the right idea will come to you in its own time. And you’ll say to yourself  Eureka! I have something to write about now!”  \n\nWith theatrical fervor  before he walked out, leaving me alone with my thoughts and a rough draft of a story that now looked like a horrid and detestable abomination to my eyes staring back at me from the screen of my laptop.\n\nI lamented my inability to reach into  the ethereal realm of imagination just long enough to pull out the even the smallest embers of an idea, that could in turn be nurtured into a fire from which I could forge words and sentences, and then use those to make paragraphs, and then build those paragraphs into a cohesive narrative that could be sold to a wide audience of readers that sought out even the smallest escape from banal the realities of their day to day lives with ravenous abandon and  briefly considered deleting the whole thing in a fit of frustration before I just opened up another tab in my web browser and started monotonously clicking on Youtube video after Youtube video with the attention span of a squirrel stricken with ADHD. \n\nI had listened to about half a horror story narration who’s overall plot sounded infuriatingly similar to the one I had written when I felt my phone vibrating in my pocket. It was becoming relatively late at this point, the evening sun had just about completed it’s descent under the horizon, painting the evening sky with deep hues of  red and purple as it went and I could hear the soft patter of summer rain, like the subtle tapping of thousands of tiny  little fingers against my window pane as I fished my phone out of my pocket to see who could be calling me.  \n\nThe number that flashed across my phone’s screen was not one I recognized, so I just declined the call as was my habit. I had barely put the phone back in my pocket when it started vibrating again. I took it back out and peered at the screen. The same number was calling me again. I declined it again only to have it call me a third time. \n\nWhoever it was, they seemed pretty damn desperate to get a hold of me. So with my curiosity piqued, I decided to answer it. \n\n“ Hello?” \n\nI got no immediate verbal response, but noted what sounded like running water and the steady, rhythmic clicking of something metallic in the background. I was half a second away from hanging up when a voice I didn’t recognize finally spoke up. \n\n“ Hello?” It said  back to me.  \n\n“ Who is this?” \n\n“ Who is this?” the voice repeated.   \n\n“ You’re the one who called, so you tell me.”  \n\nI had said, already annoyed with this mystery caller. The voice on the other end simply repeated my words back to me again in a sarcastic and juvenile tone the likes of which you’d expect to hear from a middle schooler, self assured and totally convinced that his lame joke was in fact hilarious.   \n\n“ You’re the one who called, so you tell me.” \n\nThe voice sounded like someone young trying to do an impression of someone much older, a gruff monotone that cracked at frequent intervals revealing a softer and higher pitched sounding voice that almost sounded feminine though  I couldn’t quite decipher if it was male or female. But regardless  It seemed obvious to me at this point that this was some bored kid’s idea of a prank call, and since I wasn’t really doing much anyway I decided to play along for a minute. \n\n“ I’m an unoriginal dipshit.” I said, waiting for the voice to repeat it. \n\nThe voice let out a delighted giggle before saying \n\n“ You’re an unoriginal dipshit.” \n\n“ Yes. Ha ha, very funny. Listen kid, 1997 called and it wants its lame prank call back. If you’re gonna do shit like this, you need to at least be funny first.” \n\nThe voice didn’t respond right away and I was about to hang up when it said \n\n“ If you say so, Maestro.” \n\nThen the line went dead. \n\nWeird. \n\nMy first immediate thought was that Terry must have been the prank caller, and that he had probably used some kind of voice changer the likes of which you could buy at a Halloween shop or order online. I made a mental note to chastise him for interrupting my work next time I saw him and then I put my phone back in my pocket and went back to surfing the web, putting the strange prank call out of my mind. I spent another hour or so watching videos and intermittently adding a few new sentences to my story that seemed doomed to remain forever unfinished due to my own lack of creativity before I decided to get up from my desk and go downstairs to make a pot of coffee, as I usually did when I needed to kick start my imagination. \n\nLeaving my desk, I stepped over some dirty clothes that never managed to make their way to the hamper that laid at the foot of my bed and made my way out into the hallway. As I walked toward the stairs I passed the washing machine and the dryer that lay in a closet just at the top of the stairs and noted the familiar sound of running water and the steady rhythmic clicking of something metallic coming from the dryer as the machines worked through their wash cycles.  \n\nThat was pretty common in my house, especially since Terry rarely ever bothered to check his pockets for change before he put his clothes through the wash, and the end result was always that metallic clicking sound as the change left in his pocket was tossed around in the dryer. \n\nThis kind of solidified my idea that Terry was my mystery caller, and I resolved to go downstairs and make fun of him for his lame attempt at a prank while I made my coffee. I strolled down the steps at a leisurely pace and proceeded into the somewhat cluttered living room where I found Terry lounging on the couch watching what looked like some old black and white Noir film. \n\nThe TV screen was filled with the image of a middle-aged man in an overcoat and a fedora that seemed to be the trademark of the genre as he browsed what appeared be a library bookshelf absentmindedly before a woman approached him and asked \n\n“ Can I help you sir?” \n\n“ Oh yeah I’m looking for a good mystery on something off the beaten track like the *Maltese Falcon.”* he replied. \n\nThe two characters bantered back and forth like that while Terry watched with intrigue, totally oblivious to my approach. I scooped the remote up off the couch and tossed it at him lightly, intending to startle him. He jolted upward when the remote made its impact and whirled around with a scowl on his face.\n\n“ What the fuck dude?” \n\n“ That’s for that lame prank call, you seriously gotta up your game man! hard to believe you called me unoriginal” \n\nTerry looked both perplexed and genuinely confused by my statement, being ever the dramatic actor that he was.  \n\n“ What are you talking about?” \n\n“ Don’t play dumb Terry, the voice changer was a nice touch but I could tell it was you on the phone. Nobody else calls me Maestro.” \n\n“Phone? Voice changer? What the actual fuck are you talking about man? Why would I call you for anything? You’re literally in shouting distance.” \n\n“ Yeah, sure of course Terry. You're clearly innocent, it was obviously the boogeyman who interrupted my writing session with a lame ass prank call from on top of the stairs.” \n\nI replied sarcastically.  Terry’s response was defensive. \n\n“ Look man if somebody prank-called you, it wasn’t me, I don’t even have my phone on me, it’s in my room on the charger!” \n\nI had expected him to smile and laugh while he admitted to making the call, maybe even make a few well-intentioned jabs at my writing like he usually did, but his adamant refusal to accept responsibility began to sow seeds of doubt in my mind. \n\n“ Cut the shit man! I know it was you, it had to have been. I could hear the washer and dryer in the background!” \n\nTerry opened his mouth to reply but the words died on his lips as a loud crashing sound resonated from upstairs and both of us turned a deathly pale. The sound was followed by  loud scratching noises like nails on a chalkboard and then the quick pitter patter of what sounded like small feet running quickly down the hallway before silence prevailed throughout the house once again. \n\nI looked at Terry with undisguised fear in my eyes. Our sister was spending the night at a friend's house and our parents were both working until late, meaning Terry and I were supposed to be alone in the house, so it goes without saying that we were both scared shitless by this development. \n\nAfter a few tense moments of silent stillness I finally said to Terry \n\n“ Go get something from the kitchen.” \n\nHe nodded, understanding that by “something” I meant a weapon we could use for self-defense since it seemed clear that we were dealing with some kind of break in. Without a word in response, he went to the kitchen and I followed close behind. We each grabbed the largest and sharpest kitchen knives we could find and proceeded back into the living room toward the stairs. \n\nI don’t think I’ve ever taken longer to climb up a flight of stairs in my life than I did in those moments. Adrenaline slowed the flow of time down to a trickle and each step felt like a mile. \n\nEven with Terry at my back I don’t think I’d ever been more scared in my life. As we both ascended the staircase not knowing what the Hell to expect, all of the typical sounds I usually associated with my house suddenly sounded alien and threatening. Every creak of a floorboard was an attacker about to ambush me, and every gust of wind that echoed from outside was a monster about to leap from the shadows. \n\nWhen we finally did make it to the top of the stairs, I found my bedroom door hanging open, and after getting closer, I saw what looked like some kind of weird geometric symbol on the inside of the door that looked as if someone had carved it into the wood with their fingernails. Fresh crimson droplets of blood ran down the door in some areas where the symbol had been drawn, and I almost gagged when I saw what looked like an entire blackened  fingernail lodged in the door, as if someone had jammed their fingers into the wood of the door so deep and with such haste that they literally tore off their own fingernails while drawing this weird arcane symbol that almost looked like a star with seven ugly points that curved outward along the width of my door like talons with an inverted triangle at its center. \n\n“What the fuck?” \n\nI heard Terry say behind me as I slowly proceeded  into my bedroom with the kitchen knife at the ready since I was now totally convinced that some psychotic teenager had just broken into our house. As I passed through the door frame and into my room with Terry in toe, fear gave way to confusion as I looked around my bedroom expecting to find it ransacked after the commotion I heard from downstairs only to find it neater than I had left it just moments ago, and not just neater, but wholly different in ways that shouldn’t have been possible in the short time that I was downstairs. \n\nThe wallpaper for example had been a dim, dingy green when I went downstairs to get coffee, but now was a bright mustard yellow with this tacky floral pattern. My writing desk and laptop were in the same place as they were before I left, but the laptop charger and even the outlet it was plugged into were now located on the opposite wall from where they were before I left. Clothes that had been strewn across the floor were now tidily folded and placed atop an ornate looking dresser I’d never seen before, and the posters of various cartoon characters that had been on my walls had been replaced with framed portraits of people I didn’t recognize . \n\nAn old woman in an expensive looking red satin dress with sad gray eyes, a middle aged man in a dark overcoat with a bitter expression etched into his bearded face, and a yellow-eyed child whose face reached into the Uncanny Valley and disturbed me deeply. He looked normal at a glance but the longer I stood and looked at him the more off he seemed. His eyes were too far apart and his prominent cheek bones were a bit too high while his nose was a bit too low on his face. It looked less like a portrait of a real person and more like some  alien who had never actually seen a human child before had attempted to paint one based on a description of one alone.  \n\nTerry and I must have stood there staring at my room’s sudden transformation with slack-jawed confusion and mounting terror for what felt like forever before the ring of the cell phone in my pocket snapped us out of our stupor. I fished the phone out of my pocket with trepidation and felt my blood curdle in my veins when I looked at the screen and saw my mystery caller’s number flashing across it. \n\nI answered it almost without thinking. \n\n“ Can I help you sir?”\n\nthe voice asked, sounding delighted that I had answered the phone on the first ring. \n\n“ Wha..what the fuck is going on? Who are you? What do you want?” \n\n“ I’m looking for a good mystery off the beaten track like the *Maltese Falcon”*   \n\n“ Look kid I don’t know how you got in here or what you want but you’re sick and you need to leave my house now, my brother and I are armed and if you don’t get the fuck out right now somebody is gonna get hurt.” \n\n“ Somebody is gonna get hurt. You need to leave *my* house now”  \n\nIt repeated with a demented giggle, adding emphasis to the word “ my” as if to say that this was not my house at all, but rather Its before the line went dead.  \n\nMy next immediate instinct was to call the police and I readied myself to dial 911 only to have my heart sink as I found that I suddenly had no service. I turned back to Terry to see his face a pale, bloodless mask of dumbfounded confusion as he looked toward the doorway that lead back into the hallway and I followed his gaze to find that the plain, white wall of our hallway had been replaced by the same mustard yellow wallpaper that now covered the walls of my room. \n\nNot only that, but on the wall directly opposite to my room, carved in the same grotesque manner as the symbol on my door, was a cryptic  message of some kind that read \n\n“ Seven points for seven doors, seven horns upon seven heads, and seven sacrifices asleep in their beds.” \n\n“ Wha…what the actual fuck?” \n\nTerry wondered aloud in a bewildered voice and I had no words to form a reply. I could still hear the rain as it beat against the window pane from outside, each drop against the glass sounded in my ears like the crack of thunder as my mind reeled from what was unfolding before me, and the sound brought me back  to what I know loosely refer to as reality. I clutched the kitchen knife in my hand while I turned back to Terry. \n\n“We have to get outside!” \n\nHe nodded in agreement and we both bolted for the hallway toward the stairs, only to find them completely missing when we made our way out of my bedroom. Replaced by a long hallway covered with that same ugly yellow wallpaper and lined with countless doors all etched with that same gruesome symbol and portraits identical to the ones in my room hung from the walls at regular intervals. \n\nScared doesn’t begin to describe what I felt as I looked down that long hallway where my stairs used to be. Nothing seemed to make sense anymore. I looked behind me to see what remained of my house’s second floor replaced by this hallway that seemed to stretch on endlessly until it faded from view. In a panic I ran down the hallway as fast as I could, heedless to Terry’s cries for me to slow down as I searched desperately for an exit and found only more of the hallway. \n\nThat’s when my phone rang out again. I hesitated to answer for only a moment, before I accepted the call and brought the phone back up to my ear. \n\n“Hello?” I asked \n\n“Hello,” the voice said.      \n\n“What is this place? Why are you doing this?” \n\nThe voice’s response was petulant, like that of a child explaining the obvious. \n\n“Because the essence of a good horror story is a lack of control.” \n\nMy response to this thing’s twisted taunting died in my throat when I heard Terry scream somewhere far behind me followed by the guttural growls of something that sounded utterly inhuman. Without thinking, I pocketed my phone and called out after him as I turned tail and ran back down the hallway looking for him but found only a massive pool of blood that started in the middle of the hallway, and ended at one of the doors on the right. \n\nI approached the door slowly with the kitchen knife still in hand, mortal terror making each step a herculean task. The sharp hiss of the door’s hinges made the hair on the back of my neck stand up as I stepped through the doorway, expecting to see something ghastly, only to see my empty bedroom, just as I had left it before I had gone downstairs to harass Terry. \n\nI looked around in astonished bewilderment, and saw that the strange hallway that had been there just a moment before I stepped through the doorway was now gone, replaced by my own second floor hallway. I must have slammed and opened it again at least ten times trying to get it to open back up into that awful yellow hallway to no avail. I ran all throughout the house calling out for Terry only to met with the silence of an empty house with my brother nowhere to be found.  \n\nLeft with no other options, I quickly donned my jacket and ran out the front door into the freezing rain toward the police station up the road, desperate to tell someone about what I had just gone through. I must have made it at least halfway down the street when I heard my phone ring again, for the last time that night, and I answered it with rage and indignation pouring from my voice. \n\n“ What have you done with Terry!?” \n\nAt first there was no answer, just the steady sound of something metallic clicking in the background before the Voice finally said. \n\n“ You have something to write about now, Maestro.” \n\nAnd the line went dead. \n\nYou’d think that hearing that awful voice next to the unmistakable sounds of my own washer and dryer would have terrified me, because that meant that whatever that thing was, it was still in my house. But that’s not what scared me the most about that final call. \n\nWhat scared me the most was that the voice now sounded exactly like Terry.",

        "text": "(First: https://redd.it/xuwj9d Previous: https://redd.it/ye5v9j)\n\nEven though my life was one dedicated to always being on the move, I rarely rode a plane somewhere. Driving across North America was easy enough. I wasn’t in a hurry to get anywhere nor had much of a desire to go to more tropical locations. Besides for work, I never thought about booking a flight.  \n\nA request came in asking me to investigate a certain odd sighting of a plane that started to appear at airports. There was a bit of a pattern to the sightings, and The Corporation was fairly certain this mystery plane was real. I normally only got called if they needed someone to confirm certain cases or gather information. An agent should be the one dispatched to tracking down this plane, but none were available.  \n\nThey offered to cover any costs for this trip including food and hotel rooms so I took the request. My new job was to hang around airports waiting for what they dubbed the Ghost Plane to appear and then try to board it. From what I’ve been told, pilots saw the plane appear out of thin air at day break. Some thought the Ghost Plane may crash into their plane causing a bit of a shock to the passengers when they moved off course trying to avoid something that wasn’t there. A few people even were able to get on the empty Ghost Plane. They were the only ones on the flight, not even the attendants. By some miracle the plane got them to where they needed to go and the airport staff didn’t have a clue on how someone who missed their flight suddenly appeared at the gate of the plane that they never boarded. \n\nOverall, it all sounded harmless. But I knew that when it came the supernatural, things don’t always turn out well. At least I was the one who took this job. If there was danger waiting, I would stay alive through it. But I worried over the outcome. What if the plane decided it didn’t want to land? Would I get trapped on it forever? Just flying through the air completely alone? This job wasn’t ideal but then again, none of them really are. \n\nI was told the most likely airport the Ghost Plane would appear at based on the reports and scattered known bits of the flight pattern The Corporation picked up. I walked inside the busy building getting acquainted with all the gate locations. Since I don’t fly often, I wasn’t sure if airports liked having a strange man wondering around for hours between different gates. The managers were told a lie beforehand that gave me whatever access I needed. I even was given an official looking lanyard to flash in case any staff got on my case.  \n\nI was also provided with a credit card for food. It was very tempting to splurge on new paperback books and overpriced coffee. I just got the basics I needed but did treat myself to a cinnamon bun. I think the airport air made them taste better. \n\nI pretty much lived inside that airport for two days. Nothing strange happened the first night. I’ve slept on worst surfaces before, but curling up on one of the uncomfortable seats and using a jacket as a blanket wasn’t pleasant. My entire body was stiff by the second day of walking. By one in the morning on the second night I was so tired I nearly gave up to find a hotel room. A sound of heels on the tile floor and my name snapped me out of my sleepy state. \n\n“I was told to come get you if something odd happened and well... this is odd.” An attendant told me in a concerned voice. \n\nI followed her and listened while we made our way over to an empty gate. \n\n“A plane showed up at this gate ten minutes ago. It’s locked but the weird thing is, no one saw it landing. In fact, all the strips would have been busy by the time it would have landed. Someone should have either run right into it, or saw something. It’s not possible it just sat outside all day without anyone noticing.” She explained.  \n\nThe odd sight drew in a small crowd of the overnight workers. None of them understood how the plane appeared out of thin air or what to do from there. I could see the mystery plane from the wall of windows just beside the gate. It looked normal besides the lack of any company logo on the side. A pair stood next to the gate doors, debating on if they wanted to go inside. One wore a neatly pressed suit and I assumed he was a manager. I quickly went over to take over. \n\n“I’ll go inside. You all stay here.” I said hoping I sounded confident. \n\n“Is that safe? Should we be calling the police?” The man asked. \n\nA set of TFA agents were walking over to the small crowd. The manager must have wanted them to go on first instead of a stranger with unknown credentials. I took action before he could call the police to muddle this entire job. I walked through the hallway, the manager and some people calling me back. I waved a hand over my shoulder but didn’t look at them to let them see how scared I felt walking towards the mystery plane. \n\n“I know what I'm doing. If I don’t come back out in an hour then you can call some higher ups.” I called back.  \n\nThat was a lie. I had no idea what to do. I should have called in a real agent to deal with this. But they were on short supply and wouldn’t get here fast enough. The plane could disappear at any time. Plus, more people might see the mystery plane causing the cover up to be more of a hassle. No, I needed to do what I could to deal with the problem. Even if I didn’t know what just yet. \n\nI stopped at the end of the short hallway expecting a locked door on the other side. The girl who got me did say the plan was locked. Instead, I stared at an open door, the entrance inviting me inside. I took a second to push down my fear then walked onto the plane. After all, people had been on an empty flight without any issues. Why would my flight be any different? \n\nI didn’t get very far inside when the door shut on its own behind me. I nearly was knocked off my feet by the entire plane shifting suddenly. I caught myself on a seat and was helpless to stop the massive steel monster from starting to slowly move down the runway. This was bad. Very bad. Why the hell did I agree to this job? I tried the door in vain, then start to run down the aisle way looking for any possible way out.  \n\nBy the time I went up and down the entire plane, we were already in the air. I saw the lights of the city below through the small windows as I raced past. There was no one besides myself. No luggage, nothing useful. I found a few emergency doors that refused to open not matter how hard I tried. I checked my phone to see if I could call for help. The screen flickered in a way that made my stomach drop. Phones and magic did not mix at all. I’ve been through enough broken and fried cellphones to know what one looked like when it was suffering from being shorted out from magic in the air. I knew that this plane wasn't normal, but I never would have assumed it held so much power to kill a cellphone given to me by The Corporation. They made it to hold up around monsters who oozed power and yet this plane bricked it. \n\nEven a normal person who didn’t have a clue about magic could feel the power in the plane. I got uneasy right away. This was officially above my paygrade. Since I already was there, I might as well look around. I don’t fly often. I really didn’t know what planes looked like on the onside beside a long row of seats. I started from the back to the front checking every corner I could see. The bathrooms ran just fine, at least I wouldn’t die of thirst. The small kitchen area held some food and drinks. At least enough food for a few weeks. God, would I get stuck here for that long? I really didn’t want that to be the case. \n\nUnable to help myself, I found a seat in first class to sit down and check my phone again. I wouldn’t be able to be in a seat like this any time soon. I might as well take the chance when I had it. Aside from the normal sounds of the massive machine, there wasn’t any other noise. I looked out the window seeing nothing but darkness. We did take off in the middle of the night. The sun wouldn't rise for a few more hours trapping me in the dark. Even if I could see outside, I wouldn’t know where we were headed.  \n\nI wasted time trying to open the cockpit without any luck. There wasn’t much to do on an empty plane. I stole a soda from the kitchen area to look around a second time with. For some reason, the idea to narrate my actions came to mind. I doubted anyone would be listening. But just in case, this might alert whatever creature made this plane suddenly appear that they picked up someone. \n\n“This is pretty boring you know. Nothing to do. I didn’t even find those little peanuts. Have they stopped giving them out?” I asked not expecting an answer. \n\nI sighed hearing no response. I kept talking to myself about nothing much. Another idea came to mind. Normally when I mentioned I worked with The Corporation creatures reacted. They were either afraid of it, or hated agents for pretty valid reasons. I also got some negative responses when I said some creatures looked cute. But I wasn’t that weird to think planes could be attractive. I had some odd tastes, but not that weird. \n\n“Hey so, I work for The Corporation. We just wanna know what you’re doing and all that. If you could answer-” \n\nThe plane suddenly dipped making me lose my footing and spill the drink in my hand. I scrambled trying to get back up. Being in a plane that changed course even in the slightest was scary as hell. I don’t care who you are. I couldn't really die but that didn’t mean I wanted to go through a fiery crash. \n\nI got back to my feet seeing that something changed. A person stood in the aisle. I should have been glad to see someone but nope. They weren’t a person. Just a black solid shape holding a very sharp weapon. I turned on my heel to run. Aside from hiding in the bathroom I didn’t have a plan.  \n\nAnother black shape cut off my path towards my only safe spot in the entire damn plane. Turning around wasn't an option. I ran past the newly formed figure, barely squeezing past it. Thank God I often didn’t have the money to spend on three good meals a day. I thought I saw a second bathroom near first class I just needed to keep running. My heart hammered through my chest from the short sprint. \n\nThe plane dipped causing my feet to slip again., So many of those dark passengers appeared out of the floor and between seats. When I fell, I landed on one that halfway crawled out of the floor. With the dark knife it held point upwards. \n\nI felt the blade slide into my stomach, and thought I saw an expression of shock on the blank face. Due to adrenaline, I didn’t feel the pain. I steadied myself, holding the knife still as I ran. My body slammed against the cockpit door unaware of how I got there. My head swam from shock and fear. Within seconds those figures would overtake me. I stood helpless watching them press onwards. \n\nThe door opened making me spill inside the small space. I quickly closed the door, locking it with shaking hands. Blood from the stab wound poured down my leg. The knife disappeared after being too far away from the host. I looked over my shoulder to see someone sitting in one of the seats. I collapsed in the other, light headed from lack of blood and pain. \n\nI glanced over at the pilot expecting him to be like the ones outside. Instead, he just looked like any regular person you might meet on the street. I placed a hand over my wound trying in vain to keep pressure on it. I knew I was going to die. I just hope we landed before then. \n\n“Are you...” I started to ask the man sitting next to me. \n\nHe didn’t look over. He shushed me, his blue eyes glued on the window in front of us. A small white pin on his hat caught the light. I turned my head just in time to see the sun rising. The light pouring over the clouds and sea. If you haven’t seen the sun, come up while in the air. I recommended it. The sight was one of the most beautiful things I've seen. For a few seconds I forgot about my pain to focus on just that light. All at once, I understood the person sitting next to me. \n\n“I just want to see the sun every day. That’s all.” The pilot said, his voice calm and even. \n\nBoth his and the plane’s only purpose was to see this sight. Over and over again. He wasn’t a man hungry monster, or dangerous. He just wanted a simple thing. The only reason why the plane made those figures to attack me as just to hopefully scare away anyone from trying to take down this plane. I doubted any of them wanted to actually hurt me. I just slipped. A guilty look came over his face when he saw how much blood stained my clothing. My eyes started to get heavy and everything felt so damn cold. \n\n“It’s not fair...” I said, words barely above a whisper. \n\nThe Corporation would take down this plane. He risked getting in the path of another in flight either crashing it or spreading rumors certain people didn’t want out. Supernatural things and humans didn’t mix, no matter how harmless their intentions may be.  \n\n“I’m landing shortly. Just hold on.” \n\nI shook my head wanting to tell him it was fine. It didn’t matter if I died or not. If he landed now, he wouldn’t be able to see the sun rise again and that scared me. My body failed me, sending me down into a darkness I hated. \n\nI did die. But not on the plane. He landed and I appeared at a gate with people around. They got me stable and in the hospital. The Corporation sent and agent to review my situation. They knew the wound needed time to heal so their agent killed me in the hospital bed. A bit rude if you ask me. I woke up perfectly fine the next day to find The Corporation doing a lot of paper work to cover up my absence from the hospital. \n\nI got a call a few days later from an agent I hadn’t met before asking for a quick talk. We found a food stall to meet at. His suit not really the attire for people who ate in this location. I ordered something to sit with him for a few minutes. He looked like one of 340’s brother. Honestly, he had so many I wasn’t surprised. \n\n“I wanted to tell you the outcome of the so-called Ghost plane.” The Agent started. \n\nI offered him my fries and he broke character to accept them. He ate a few then pulled out a small ring box. He opened it showing me the pin I noticed the pilot wearing.  \n\n“You know about the magic streams, correct?” He asked finishing off the fires. \n\nI nodded. I knew about the streams. Or, heard about it. It was pretty complex so I only had a vague idea of it. Some places, like mountains or deep woods held a lot of magic. It’s a good reason why creatures lived there. The magic of the world flows out of them in streams that change with the season, or for other unknown reasons.  \n\n“This pin was made form a bone of some sort of powerful creature. A pilot wore it, then as a tradition handed it down to the next person. We’re not certain of how long they wore it. But due to it always following or being near the magic streams it absorbed a bunch through the years. The last pilot kept the pin hidden in a decommissioned plane because he didn’t have someone to pass it along to, I guess. The pin wanted to fly again, so took over that broken down plane. Simple as that.” \n\nTo him this had been a simple case. I bet he dealt with a lot of stranger things than a pin wanting to fly again. I crossed my arms wondering what would happen to it now. \n\n“Is it going to be locked away or something?” I asked the Agent. \n\nHe shook his head placing the box in the table between us.  \n\n“We drained some magic out of it. It’s not dangerous. I wanted to offer it to you. It’s not useful for your travels but...” He trailed off unable to say the real reason why he made the offer. \n\nHe heard the pin wanted to see the sun rise and wanted to ensure that happened. I couldn't die after all. Agent’s lives were short. There wasn’t any guarantee he made it to the next day. As much as I wanted to keep it, I shook my head. I reached over to take the pin out feeling the bone carved into the shape of a wing. I then put it on his suit jacket before he protested. \n\n“I can’t form any habits. This thing is pretty much alive at this point. It means it can die. I don’t want it to get hurt so it’s better if you’re the one to take it. It’ll be a good luck charm. You both can see the sun rise together.” I told him. \n\nHe gave the idea some thought. He let himself smile in a way most of his brothers didn’t. If he died, I felt certain this pin would be handed to the next sibling. I bought him a meal to go, which he greatly appreciated. I really wished he had a long life after our meeting. \n\nI checked my phone seeing a new request come in. I hadn’t really recovered from the plane case yet, but my bank account wasn’t entirely full. I accepted it, feeling dread about the next job. At least now I knew to stop to watch a sun rise once and a while because there are some people in this world that can’t do the same.",

        "text": " \n\npart 5\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10582du/the\\_sisters\\_of\\_perdition\\_part\\_5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10582du/the_sisters_of_perdition_part_5/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery  into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for  money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site.  There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch  of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While  renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Ewan. After  reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to  share it.\n\nMy name is Ewan and I  live in a monastery on the Mississippi river. I have trained most of my  life as a warrior monk.  I was 21. It was 1861.\n\nMuch  like 4 years ago our monastery was holding a meeting today. The KKK had  begun to round up alleged changelings again, this time in greater  numbers. The whole southeast was being targeted.\n\nA  few years ago a giant factory had been built in Dixie, manufacturing  bolt action rifles for the KKK. Now that they were adequately armed they  were getting bold.\n\nThat morning I  sat beside the water, praying with my compatriot Zackariah. We were  both a very calming presence and the animals often came to greet us.\n\nAlziza sat behind us, surveying the river.\n\n“The orcas will return” Alziza prophesied.\n\nAlmost  immediately the pod of orcas returned and came to greet us. They eyed a  native american suspiciously when they saw his whale bone club.\n\nZackariah turned and looked at me. “Fancy a swim?” And jumped into the water.\n\nI followed after him and before long we were surfing on the orcas as we did 4 years ago.\n\n“Well I was supposed to give you your test today and I think this is a great way to do it don’t you?” Zackariah laughed.\n\n“Yeah lets get started,'' I responded.\n\n“So what layer of hell are we currently in?” Zackariah asked.\n\n“We are currently in the 9th layer of hell” I responded quickly.\n\n“What happens if you commit a sin that will send you to a particular layer of hell?” Zackariah asked, surfing along.\n\n“The  demon of that layer will enter your body and you will have to contend  with it controlling your actions. The layers are as stated in Dante’s  inferno.” I responded.\n\n“”Up to what demon do we tolerate in this church?” Zackariah said with a snarl.\n\n“We  tolerate up to violence, the 7th layer. The intolerables being fraud,  treachery and Beelzebub..” I responded, surveying the willow trees and  iguana as we surfed along.\n\n“Bonus  question!” Zackariah chirped. “Get this one for extra credit! What layer  of reality was the human race before the watchers turned against Yahweh  and corrupted us?”\n\n“The fourth layer of purgatory” I responded with a grin.\n\n“You  sly devil you! You did the math didn’t you? Most people don’t actually  do the math…” Zackariah responded, surprised. He faltered for a second,  almost falling off the orca.\n\nThe orcas turned around and we doubled back.\n\n“Wow  you aced the test! Too bad its not that easy, not everyone gets a halo.  I didn’t get one and I got everything but the bonus question.”  Zackariah chirped.\n\n“The master has become the apprentice,” I joked.\n\nZackariah looked bewildered and the rest of our surf was of silent reflection.\n\nWhen we got back Max was sitting by the water talking with Alziza. Grimoire Bank and Grimoire Noir floated ominously.\n\n“I have awaited your return” Max said, looking at the orcas with love in his eyes. “Such beautiful animals”\n\nI hopped into the water and swam to shore, and stood before old Max.\n\n“On one knee child.” Max spoke.\n\nI got down on one knee and felt both Grimoire Blank and Grimoire noir on each of my shoulders.\n\nI then heard Yahweh’s voice loud and clear. “Take this halo kid, you’re going to need it.”\n\nI opened my eyes and rose looking around me, then I closed them again.\n\n‘I have a halo and I am illuminated’ and it toggled on.\n\nI  could see perfectly, my eyes were good but I could see so much detail  in everything that was so far away with the halo on. It was detailed but  different from seeing with light. Reminded me of a stylized picture  book I had seen once.\n\nI then noticed the halo above Max’s head as he looked at mine.\n\n“I  had hoped he would give you one” Max said with a smile. “I must be off  to prepare for the battle ahead.” and Max left, followed by his  possessed bibles.\n\n“Did you read that book I gave you? Jesus Christ drgaonbrorn?” Zackariah said from behind me.\n\n“Haven’t gotten around to it yet.” I said turning around.\n\n“Did you get one? If you did at 21 that would be some kind of record.” Zackariah chirped.\n\n“Yeah” I responded with finality.\n\nZackariah looked defeated and walked away. I felt envy coursing through him.\n\nI  wondered if he could see with his third eye for a second. He had all  these stories but the more he never seemed to repeat any of them made me  suspicious.\n\nWe gathered in the chapel at noon. All the monks of the monastery were present.\n\nMax stood at the front of the room with his possessed bibles, beside a stack of mail.\n\n“We will start with the cesarians this time” Max said with a smirk.\n\nHe grabbed the sealed letter and opened it. He read it over then read it aloud.\n\n“We  have investigated and found evidence of land octopus activity, we will  send 1 legion.” Max said with a smirk. He looked briefly at grimoire  Noir.\n\nHe grabbed the next letter off the table and opened it.\n\n“Abraham Lincoln will send 4000 riflemen and 400 cavalry.” MAx said, sounding impressed.\n\nThe native americans had already joined us, with a force of 500 braves this time.\n\nAfter the meeting we were off, other monks meeting us along the way as we made the journey to dixie.\n\nMany of us had horses while others marched. I rode Alziza.\n\n“The halo will make you much more effective in this fight. It lets you see in the dark you know” Alziza said ominously.\n\n“I know that” I chirped back. “Is that all you have to say wise ass?”\n\n“You’ll see.” Alziza responded ominously.\n\nWithin a few a days we started seeing alligator jaws sewn to all sorts of animals. Cows, pigs, dogs, people.\n\nAn alligator faced man and his dog watched us suspiciously then went inside their house.\n\nBefore  long we were outside of Dixie making camp. In addition to the 500  braves we had a force of 222 monks, all with bolt action rifles.\n\nBefore long some klansmen came on horseback. They had a white flag waving.\n\nDeb  was leading them and I could tell from her robes that she was a grand  dragon. The image of the red dragon was painted in blood upon her white  robe.\n\nI wondered if she recognized me, as it had been a long time and I had a beard now. She didn’t seem too.\n\n“Ya’ll  we don’t need to fight, '' Deb said with a grimace, treachery clearly  on her face. “Let us show you some southern hospitality. We’ve learned,  we’ve grown, we aren’t eating the changelings. Why don’t ya’ll come into  town and see for yourself what we have been up too.”\n\nDeb looked right at me through her thick glasses. She was basically blind and\n\nI saw no recollection in her eyes.\n\nMax  looked her over thinking, and then grimoire Blank responded for him. “I  see beyond the witch’s ploy. Take her offer, her trap is pitiful  compared to Yahweh’s wrath.”\n\nWe  gathered our rifles and followed them into town. There were children  playing in ways that seemed out of place. Like they had been put there  just to fool us. Despite this there seemed to be lots of them and my  fears were eased slightly.\n\nWe walked by the factory and I could see klansmen cleaning their guns and giggling.\n\nWe  ate dinner and it seemed to be free of any alleged changelings and we  were shown to what seemed like nice quarters. We went to bed that night  expecting Abraham Lincoln to arrive while we slept.\n\nI was awoken suddenly by screams and gunfire that night. I don’t know how long I slept, but it didn’t seem like long.\n\nI went to grab my rifle as Zackariah lazily got out of bed.\n\nThe door flew open and two gator dogs charged into the room, both biting into Zackariah.\n\nI grabbed my gun and shot one as they tore him apart. I loaded and shot the other one before it came at me.\n\nI heard screamed and gunfire coming from the other rooms and a gator faced man walked into the room.\n\n“Rufus? Doggo? NO!” He screamed.\n\nI shot him quickly and went into the hall.\n\nGator men and dogs were ripping monks and braves alike apart and I started to wonder at the book’s judgement.\n\n3 gator men looked at me and I knew my limits. I turned and ran down the halls with them following closely after me.\n\nI pushed open doors as I ran through complex, hearing gator voices taunting me from behind.\n\nEventually I came to a dead end and turned around. I saw 3 gator men and their dogs come in behind me.\n\n“You got 1 shot kid, who you going to kill?” the three gators laughed.\n\nThen a man came through the wall. He wore a cowboy hat and I could see his halo. He had a lit cigar in his mouth.\n\nHe pulled out a pistol with a revolving chamber and fired it 6 times in 3 seconds. Killing all 3 gator men and dogs.\n\nHe  squinted at me threateningly. “You monks tipped us off in the first  place. We saw the statues, but the culprit has not yet been found.” The  man said, spitting on the ground. “You know since we’re here I think  we're going to deal with this changeling abduction problem. These  klansmen could be worshiping the land octopi for all we know.”\n\nHe reloaded his revolver. And looked at my rifle.\n\n“Primitive.  You people live like animals.” The man said and phased through another  wall. I heard 6 shots ring out almost immediately.\n\nI ran down the hall until I found my way outside.\n\nThere were checkpoints everywhere, klansmen fighting northerners with equal weaponry. Bodies lined the streets.\n\nI saw a gator bear tearing a northerner apart, and another licking his blood covered chops.\n\nThe halo gave me a distinct advantage on that moonless night as I crept in the shadows, avoiding the firelight.\n\nI  came upon a courtyard and saw a number of klansmen gathered around Deb  and all 3 Dora’s. I guess they had just rezzed her after last time.\n\nAlleged changelings were tied to posts and covered with honey and jam, an offering to some creature of the night.\n\nI then heard high pitched wailing screams, reminding me of banshees.\n\nThen  I saw them, 15 foot tall monstrous women. They had their eyes missing  and sword like fingers. I thought for a second about a book I had read  on wendigos. It had said you just had to shoot them through the heart.\n\nI noted that with my halo on their heart was clearly marked. Alziza really was wise.\n\nThe wendigoes descended on the alleged changelings and stuck their sword fingers into them, sucking their blood like mosquitoes.\n\nI ran for my life, being as quiet as possible. I knew wendigoes could see in the dark too.\n\nI ran around the side of a building and saw the cowboy hatted man lying there dying. Two bullet holes in his stomach.\n\nHe  looked at me and winked. “Hey kid, do you fear your creator? If you put  me before him instead of letting me bleed out ill let you have my  rifle.” He held the weapon up. “Loads the next bullet all by itself. Put  the clip in and just pull back to empty the casing. REAL bolt action.”  he said in obvious pain.\n\nI took the gun from him, said a prayer for the cesarion and shot him through the eye like he wanted.\n\nI moved quickly knowing the gunshot would give away my location.\n\nI came upon a group of 3 other monks, all with halos.\n\n‘That’s probably why they are still alive’ I thought to myself.\n\n“Ewan! Get over here!” one of them called.\n\nAs I approached them I heard wendigo screams and turned to see 8 of them charging down the streets towards us.\n\nMe and the other monks all fired, killing four of them. Then I fired 3 more shots emptying my clip.\n\nThe lone wendigo hit us before we could even reload. They moved at 3 times the speed of horses.\n\nIts hands sliced through two of the monks, and the surviving one ran as I reloaded.\n\nThe wendigo was upon him in no time, killing him. It turned to me as I finished reloading and I shot it through the heart.\n\nI ran through the streets keeping to the shadows.\n\nThe  wendigos massacred the men without halos. They fired randomly at their  bodies, doing no apparent damage. I fled from the carnage of Dixie  running off into the overgrowth.\n\nI ran until I came into a clearing, seeing 4 wendigoes at the other side.\n\nI  aimed my rifle and fired through their hearts one by one as they ran at  me. The last one dropped to my feet and I reloaded. This was the last  clip the cesarion had given me.\n\nI heard voices in the distance and followed them to find Max and Abraham Lincoln, surrounded by northern riflemen.\n\nThey had apprehended two of the Dora’s and had them tied up.\n\nMax  and Abraham both took a jug of holy water from a spring Jesus had  blessed down in South America and poured it on the Dora’s. They totally  melted into a puddle of nasty smelling puss.\n\n“We have been repelled today, but we will return with 10 times as many troops!” Abraham Lincoln screamed. Rallying the troops.\n\nWe  left with our tails between our legs and I wondered about the  cesarians. It certainly didn’t seem like they sent an entire legion.  Perhaps they had realized our ploy and sent a smaller force?\n\nAbraham  Lincoln headed back up north. To rally as many troops as possible.  Justice would come for the KKK, an American civil war had truly begun.\n\nWhen  we reached the monastery I recorded the event so that my contemporaries  as well as future generations may have a true account of the second  changeling crisis that started the American civil war.",

        "text": "  Lloyd Dobson, my middle school bully, was the first one to see it. Had the circumstances been different, I doubt anyone would've believed what happened, though it was undeniable we encountered something on that trip. He and his buddy, Ray Mathers put me through hell for years; me and the only friends I had, along with anyone else who was unfortunate enough to have been born smaller and weaker than them. \n\n  I didn't even see Lloyd until it was all over; the events that still weigh heavily on my subconscious. I barely registered the condition he was in at the time, given the fact that I was out of it myself. After I heard the whole story, though, I never would've wished that on anyone, even if they had made life hard for me for years. \n\n  It was mid-March of 2014, with only a few months of 8th grade left, when we took that field trip. It was a fairly small school I attended back then, with even the full graduating classes consisting of maybe 30-40 students in all. The high school was in another complex, but it shared the grounds with the junior high and kindergarten, which was one of the reasons I could never escape my bullies. \n\n  I remember begging my parents to send me to a different school, but that would've required moving to a different town altogether; something they couldn't afford to do on a whim. I was well aware of that, even when I would spend hours crying after getting off the bus, but I still hoped things could've been different. \n\n  I never held it against my folks, mind you; they did everything in their power. They both kicked up a fuss at the school, threatened lawsuits, and the like if Principal Marx didn't address the problem, but that only made things worse. Yeah, they calmed down for a few weeks after Marx read them the riot act, but after a while, they got back to it, far more relentless than ever. \n\n  I pretended things had gotten better to my parents, playing off the cuts and bruises as playground accidents and the like, but I knew they knew things weren't great. Dad had dealt with bullies when he was a kid, so he likely had a good idea of what was going on, but I convinced them not to pay another visit to the school. I dreaded to think how bad it would've gotten if they had called in reinforcements and all.  \n\n  Jace Banks and Bella Sweetin were the only friends I had through kindergarten and middle school, so we sat together on the bus as we headed out to Lake Sakakawea. It was only a 30-minute trip to get there from our small North Dakota town middle school, but that was more than enough time for Lloyd and Ray to give us a quick preview of the fun they had in store for us. \n\n  While I had been out to the lake before, given that there wasn't much of anything else of interest nearby, even familiar places were so much more exciting when they were taking the place of some hours spent at school. Of course, it would surely have been more fun without the company of the biggest asshats in our class, but that didn't take away from my excitement. \n\n  Most of the other kids were cutting up or gazing out the windows at the beautiful scenery, but while we attempted to keep to ourselves, the constant barrage of spit wads and smack talk kept us from being able to relax and enjoy the ride. Gabriel Baker, our homeroom teacher who sat at the front of the bus, tried his best to turn a blind eye to the loud teens at his rear, but he would make regular empty threats in a meager attempt to calm things down. \n\n  He was always a pushover, Mr. Baker, so everyone knew he wasn't about to have the driver \"turn this damn bus around,\" regardless of the visible vein throbbing above his temple. If I couldn't take him seriously, I knew Mathers and Dobson wouldn't either.  \n\n  We still laughed and joked about all of the things that made us 'freaks' in the eyes of our peers, regardless of the endless mockery. Even if the trip felt a good deal longer than the 30 minutes or so that had gone by, we were pulling up to the parking area off to the side of the lake before we knew it. \n\n  I felt my face burn when Ray pushed Bella down the steps as she walked off the bus, but Jace caught her before her face planted into the gravel. Fortunately, Baker actually paid attention to what happened, looking as flushed as I felt at the time. He warned the chuckling duo of douchebags that he would be keeping an eye on them, and even though they laughed the whole thing off, they surprisingly kept their distance from us after that. \n\n  Sure, we could see them staring at us, talking shit from a distance over the next hour or so, but I wasn't about to allow them to stop me from having a good time. For a school field trip, it was actually quite relaxed. We didn't have any sort of itinerary or anything, no obligations, or chosen path to follow. We weren't even required to stay in a huddle, so everyone scattered to their normal groups, taking in the beautiful scenery. \n\n  It wasn't until a couple of hours had passed, as Baker was asking around about Ray and Lloyd's whereabouts, that I even noticed they had disappeared. \n\n  \"They probably just snuck off to smoke,\" Bella said, rolling her eyes. \n\n  \"Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll find 'em drowned, or something,\" Jace said, giving us a laugh. \n\n  Normally, I wasn't one to wish anything bad on anyone, even those I don't care for, but I wouldn't lose a wink of sleep if either of those two pricks had washed up dead on the riverbank. In the end, I think that may have been a better outcome than what happened. I can't believe I'm saying this, but even Lloyd Dobson didn't deserve that. \n\n  After another forty-five minutes passed by with no trace of the two bigger kids, Baker looked like he was getting pretty concerned. Regardless of whether or not the school, and the world, for that matter, would be a better place without them, they were under his watch. There's no denying he'd be in a shit ton of trouble if he lost any of the teens who were in his care, even those who were likely to grow up to be the next Gacy or Dahmer. \n\n  Our teacher gathered up the rest of us and made us stay together while he took a head count, to make sure Dobson and Mathers were the only two unaccounted for. Once he was satisfied, he and Umber, the bus driver, headed out to search for the missing asshats. \n\n  \"Those two always gotta be the center of attention,\" Jace said, shaking his head with his eyes rolling. \n\n  \"Hopefully,\" I said, almost under my breath, \"they found a hill to tumble down and broke every damn bone in their bodies.\"\n\n  \"Damn, dude,\" Bella said with a chuckle, \"little harsh, huh?\" \n\n  \"Wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit,\" I said bluntly. \n\n  Sure, I felt a little embarrassed when Bella called me out, especially since she only laughed when Jace made the crack about them drowning, but those two could go to hell, for all I cared. They had gone to great lengths to make life miserable for any of the weaker kids, ever since kindergarten.\n\n  Even if their home life was a trainwreck, inspiring them to lash out in any way they could, wasn't my problem. All I knew was that I hated them with the passion of a thousand suns. That was until the screaming began. \n\n  I couldn't tell if it was Ray or Lloyd who made that horrified shriek; it may have been Baker of Umber, for all I could tell from the sound of it. Whoever it was, it silenced every one of us who remained huddled in the group, awaiting our teacher's return. \n\n  \"OH GOD!\" a voice howled from a distance, \"FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, HELP ME!\" \n\n  There was murmuring through the group, accompanied by wide eyes and shocked expressions. While nobody exactly jumped at the opportunity to assist whoever was yelling out, I can't deny that my curiosity was practically bubbling over. \n\n  When I ran for the treeline, intent on seeking out the source of the terrified wailing, I can't honestly say where my mind was at the time. For some reason, I didn't even factor in that the assholes could be playing some sort of prank, just to make me look stupid in front of everyone. I think my curiosity overruled my common sense at the time; my instincts took the wheel, not allowing me to give it a second thought.\n\n  I heard my friends call out to me as I sprinted between the trees, but I was so focused on that haunting sound, I paid little attention to them. Even after the screams softened to more of a constant moaning, I could tell it wasn't far ahead. As I drew closer to another parting in the trees; one that looked as though it led to another section of the lake we came to visit, I allowed the throbbing in my side to slow my approach. \n\n  \"What the hell, man!?\" Jace said as he and Bella came up behind me. \n\n  \"You nuts?\" Bella asked, panting for breath, \"you don't run towards shit like this, dingus!\" \n\n  \"But what if they're hurt?\" I said, choosing not to reveal the other side of my reasoning for running this way. \n\n  \"Then, we call someone: 911, or some shit. We don't go lookin' for trouble, Billy,\" Jace said, slugging me on the shoulder. \n\n  With that whimpering just ahead; maybe twenty or thirty feet off, if I had to guess, I just looked in the direction I was heading, then back at my friend's. They both looked lost for words, glancing at one another, seemingly having some sort of silent debate, before Bella gave a shuddering sigh. \n\n  \"Okay,\" she said, \"but if you get me killed, I'm kicking your ass!\" \n\n  Leading the way, I pushed through the brush between the trees, stepping out to the riverbank. Baker, it seems, was the one providing the ambient moaning, as he writhed on the gravelly ground, holding his hands over his eyes. \n\n  He didn't look hurt; not that I could tell anyway, but there was definitely something wrong with him. I crouched down beside him, laying a hand on his shoulder, which he instantly jerked himself away from, scraping his legs against the ground to push his body from me. With another attempted touch of my hand, he began to scream again, folding himself into the fetal position with his back to me. \n\n  \"Mr. Baker. It's me, Billy Johnson, your student. What's…\"\n\n  \"DON'T TOUCH ME!\" he yelled, again scraping his body across the ground; flopping around like a fish out of water.  \n\n  \"What the actual…\" Jace said before his words trailed off. \n\n  When I turned to see him staring at the water, steadily inching towards it, I couldn't tell what had inspired his eyes to grow so large and his jaw to fall limp. \n\n  \"It's coming back!\" Baker said, his screams replaced by mad laughter, \"you'll see…\" \n\n  \"What…\" \n\n  I turned to look at the man who had finally raised himself, almost stunned as his hands slipped from his face. \n\n  \"Then you won't…\"\n\n  I felt my jaw unhinge when I saw the blank and lifeless, milky-white eyes of my homeroom teacher, staring into oblivion. The skin around his eyelids was torn and split from where it looked as though his fingernails had dug into the flesh, but there was nothing behind his empty gaze.\n\n  \"What is that?\" Jace asked from somewhere outside my erratic thoughts. \n\n  When I looked up to see him and Bella both, gazing almost entranced at the water, I turned to see what had their undivided attention. When my eyes met the almost hypnotic, vibrant red that shimmered beneath the afternoon sun, I was barely aware of getting back to my feet, to join my friends as they paced toward the rapids. \n\n  \"NO!\" a voice called out, almost pulling my transfixed glare from the eerie, yet beautiful sight. \n\n  As something began to rise from beneath the rippling surface of the lake; something I still steadily approached, I felt my body colliding with the ground once more, with the wind knocked out of me. Whether my legs had somehow given out at the sight of whatever was freeing itself from the water, or that something else left me splayed out on the gravel, coughing and wheezing, I didn't know at the time. Either way, once my eyes were distracted from the mesmerizing sight, I felt my senses begin to return. \n\n  \"Don't look at it!\" a familiar voice said, pushing me back on my ass before I could pick myself back up. \n\n  \"What the fuck, dude!?\" Bella barked, having joined me on the ground at some point. \n\n  A thick and muscled arm wrapped around me, while another shielded my friend from whatever was happening. When I heard a howling sound of madness, emitting from the mouth of the friend who did not share my company on the ground, I fought against the one who held me in place, desperate to reach Jace. \n\n  \"Oh God…oh Jesus…\" my friend whimpered before another shrill squeal echoed from his mouth. \n\n  \"Let…me…go,\" I begged, battling harder against my subduer with every word. \n\n  \"You can't!\" he said, \"you can't look at it!\"\n\n  \"But, Jace…\"\n\n  \"He's already gone. Too late for him now…it'll be over in a moment, just…\"\n\n  \"NO!\" I screamed, launching my knee into the gut of whoever held me on the ground. \n\n  As a horrendous roaring sound joined the horrified wails of my friend, I felt my legs betray me as I attempted to lift myself back up. When I noticed it was Ray Mathers who still tried to pull me back down to where he crouched, holding a writhing Bella in place, I grew certain this was some bizarre stunt or prank, designed to make us feel like idiots when the curtain was pulled back. \n\n  With that, I was more determined than ever to reach Jace, worried he was caught in the middle of some cruel joke performed by the other half of our duet of tormentors. \n\n  \"What the hell are you guys playing at now?\" I asked, finally breaking free of his grasp, \"this shit ain't funny, you…\" \n\n  I didn't know where the attack came from, but whatever caught me across the jaw left my head loopy and my eyes crossed for a time. When I spun in place, wrestling to remain on feet that felt disconnected from my body, I could barely believe what my faltering vision revealed. My mind was dazed from the hit, my thoughts were all over the place, but even through my blurred and unfocused sight at the time, I couldn't even hope to rationalize the thing that stood waist-deep in the water. \n\n  Jace had dropped to the ground, still screaming and writhing in place, just as we had found Mr. Baker, but the creature just gazed back at us, barely moving. Maybe it was just my reeling and jarred consciousness that inspired some bizarre hallucination, but my shell-shocked brain could barely wrap around the sight of this thing. \n\n  It stood the height of a tall person, lean, yet muscled, its every inch layered with brownish-red hair. The face was long and gaunt, with longer hair hanging like a beard on its chin and from the top of its head, with a single, glowing, orange eye, dead in the center of its forehead. A long horn protruded from directly above it, like an extended brow, twisting and coiled like a static serpent. \n\n  Were it not for the impending dizziness, brought on by whatever left my jaw swelling, I can only imagine what effect the sight of this thing could have had on me. Likely, I would be in a similar state as my teacher and friend, who still contorted their bodies against the gravel, moaning in shared anguish. \n\n  Just as I began to feel the loopiness completely numb the senses it had muted, I saw the creature turn away from me, lowering back into the water. The last thing I saw before everything went black, was the sight of the jagged, saw-like spine that pushed through the back of the monster. It was like a grotesque fin that carved through the water like a hot knife through butter, as it drifted away.  \n\n  When my eyes reopened, or I should say, when they were forced back open by the paramedic shining the light on them, it took me a moment to relocate my bearings. From what I could tell, I had been moved away from the water, though I could still hear it rushing from somewhere in the background.\n\n  \"Can you tell me your name?\" the medic asked, turning his light off while I blinked my eyes. \n\n  \"Billy…Billy Johnson…what..?\" \n\n  \"Do you know where you are, how you got here?\" \n\n  \"It's…we're on a field trip…who?\" \n\n  \"This one's lucid,\" he called to someone else before a stocky, balding police officer came strolling up beside him. \n\n  I could see more paramedics working on the others, but Lloyd and Umber looked as catatonic as Jace and Baker. At the time, I could only speculate as to what had happened to them, as I had only been present for my friend losing his shit, but it would all be revealed soon enough. \n\n  Though I was still somewhat out of it, I answered the officers' questions to the best of my ability. Recounting the events that still felt vague and scattered at best, was no easy task, but the more we spoke, the more my senses returned. \n\n  I would have to recall this tale to others over the hours and days that followed, along with Bella and Ray, but it would be some time before we were informed about the fate of our teacher and friends. \n\n  According to Ray, he and his friend had been walking the riverbank, having snuck away from the rest of the class a while back. When Lloyd began to act strangely, stopping in place to gaze at the water with his body trembling, Ray turned to see him transfixed by the reddening water.\n\n  He got in front of his friend, shaking him violently in an effort to break his unwavering focus, but when he heard the roaring sound from behind him, he turned, allowing only his periphery to see the creature emerging from the lake. \n\n  When Lloyd shrieked at the sight of this thing, Ray whipped his attention back to the one before him, refusing to permit his eyes to meet what he feared to be creeping up on him from behind. As his friend fell to the ground, Umber broke through the treeline, his legs immediately paralyzed by the sight of the monster, as his screams joined Lloyd's.  \n\n  At that, Ray ran for it, wasting no time in attempting to preserve his life, regardless of the state his friend was in at the time. I could tell he was ashamed of his actions, while he recounted them, but I couldn't blame him; there was nothing he could've done, after all. \n\n  He hid in the bushes, between the trees, trembling from head to toe, terrified that the creature would seek him out. Having no idea how long he stayed there, nestled away in the brush, he couldn't tell how much time had passed when he heard Baker howling from somewhere to his left. \n\n  It wasn't until he watched my friends and me approaching from a distance that he finally convinced himself to take action. By the time he arrived at the scene, Jace was already mesmerized by the sight of the thing rising from the lake, so he tackled Bella and me; the only two he thought he could save. When I broke free of his grip, the only thing he could think to do was clock me as hard as he could. \n\n  \"Better bruised than whatever happened to Lloyd,\" he said, wearing an apologetic expression. \n\n  Even with everything he and Lloyd had put me through over the years, I couldn't hold it against him. Had he not left my head spinning, I would surely have ended up in the same condition as the others. \n\n  Gabriel Baker, a husband, and father to three children died on the way to the hospital. Lloyd Dobson and Jace Banks both lasted a day or two before they too lost the fight. Benjamin Umber, a widower and father to a twenty-year-old son, remains in a mental facility to this day. \n\n  All four of those who clearly saw the creature were blinded by the time the ambulance arrived, but autopsies showed no reason for that or the apparent heart attacks that put a premature end to their lives. Umber will likely live out his days in that facility; days that are numbered from what I've heard. His health has been deteriorating for some time now. Rumor has it the doctors feel his journey is coming to an end soon. \n\n  Why he lasted so much longer than the others, I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps it was simply the fact that he was further back from the lake when he saw it. Supposedly, he had left his glasses on the bus, and his vision wasn't the best before he lost his sight completely. Whatever the case, it seems that the creature got the better of him in the end. If nothing else, maybe in death, he'll finally be freed from his torment. \n\n  It wasn't long after I returned to my home that I finally got my wish: we moved away from that town to somewhere with no rivers or lakes for miles. Even now, I try to avoid coming close to anything like that. Hell, I break out in a cold sweat if I see a damn swimming pool, let alone anything not crafted by human hands. Last I heard, Ray is of the same mindset as I; that it's in our best interest to remain on dry land. \n\n  Bella and I drifted apart after that day, as she blamed me for what happened to Jace. In all honesty, I carry the burden of his death to this day. It was my damned curiosity that put us in the crosshairs of that thing. \n\n  Surprisingly, I grew closer to my former bully after the events that left us haunted and broken. We have our trauma and guilt in common, as well as the frequent nightmares that revisit that ill-fated field trip and those we lost that day.\n\n  I live in fear that, someday, the image of that monster my subconscious still holds will be enough to end my life, as it did my friends on that field trip, what feels like a lifetime ago. While I have no way of understanding why it chose to only reveal itself from a distance, rather than breaking free of the water to finish us off in a more physical manner, I would be a fool to believe I can understand the motivations of such a creature. \n\n  Just be careful when you visit the lakes and rivers of the world. If you see a shimmering red illuminating from beneath the rippling water, don't stick around to see what happens next. If you do, it may just be the last thing you ever see, before the lights go out completely.",

The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Ewan. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.\n\nMy name is Ewan and I live in a monastery on the Mississippi river. I have trained most of my life as a warrior monk.  I was 21. It was 1861.\n\nMuch like 4 years ago our monastery was holding a meeting today. The KKK had begun to round up alleged changelings again, this time in greater numbers. The whole southeast was being targeted.\n\nA few years ago a giant factory had been built in Dixie, manufacturing bolt action rifles for the KKK. Now that they were adequately armed they were getting bold.\n\nThat morning I sat beside the water, praying with my compatriot Zackariah. We were both a very calming presence and the animals often came to greet us.\n\nAlziza sat behind us, surveying the river.\n\n“The orcas will return” Alziza prophesied.\n\nAlmost immediately the pod of orcas returned and came to greet us. They eyed a native american suspiciously when they saw his whale bone club.\n\nZackariah turned and looked at me. “Fancy a swim?” And jumped into the water.\n\nI followed after him and before long we were surfing on the orcas as we did 4 years ago. \n\n“Well I was supposed to give you your test today and I think this is a great way to do it don’t you?” Zackariah laughed.\n\n“Yeah lets get started,'' I responded.\n\n“So what layer of hell are we currently in?” Zackariah asked.\n\n“We are currently in the 9th layer of hell” I responded quickly.\n\n“What happens if you commit a sin that will send you to a particular layer of hell?” Zackariah asked, surfing along.\n\n“The demon of that layer will enter your body and you will have to contend with it controlling your actions. The layers are as stated in Dante’s inferno.” I responded.\n\n“”Up to what demon do we tolerate in this church?” Zackariah said with a snarl.\n\n“We tolerate up to violence, the 7th layer. The intolerables being fraud, treachery and Beelzebub..” I responded, surveying the willow trees and iguana as we surfed along.\n\n“Bonus question!” Zackariah chirped. “Get this one for extra credit! What layer of reality was the human race before the watchers turned against Yahweh and corrupted us?”\n\n“The fourth layer of purgatory” I responded with a grin.\n\n“You sly devil you! You did the math didn’t you? Most people don’t actually do the math…” Zackariah responded, surprised. He faltered for a second, almost falling off the orca.\n\nThe orcas turned around and we doubled back.\n\n“Wow you aced the test! Too bad its not that easy, not everyone gets a halo. I didn’t get one and I got everything but the bonus question.” Zackariah chirped.\n\n“The master has become the apprentice,” I joked.\n\nZackariah looked bewildered and the rest of our surf was of silent reflection.\n\nWhen we got back Max was sitting by the water talking with Alziza. Grimoire Bank and Grimoire Noir floated ominously.\n\n“I have awaited your return” Max said, looking at the orcas with love in his eyes. “Such beautiful animals”\n\nI hopped into the water and swam to shore, and stood before old Max.\n\n“On one knee child.” Max spoke.\n\nI got down on one knee and felt both Grimoire Blank and Grimoire noir on each of my shoulders.\n\nI then heard Yahweh’s voice loud and clear. “Take this halo kid, you’re going to need it.”\n\nI opened my eyes and rose looking around me, then I closed them again.\n\n‘I have a halo and I am illuminated’ and it toggled on.\n\nI could see perfectly, my eyes were good but I could see so much detail in everything that was so far away with the halo on. It was detailed but different from seeing with light. Reminded me of a stylized picture book I had seen once.\n\nI then noticed the halo above Max’s head as he looked at mine.\n\n“I had hoped he would give you one” Max said with a smile. “I must be off to prepare for the battle ahead.” and Max left, followed by his possessed bibles.\n\n“Did you read that book I gave you? Jesus Christ drgaonbrorn?” Zackariah said from behind me.\n\n“Haven’t gotten around to it yet.” I said turning around.\n\n“Did you get one? If you did at 21 that would be some kind of record.” Zackariah chirped.\n\n“Yeah” I responded with finality.\n\nZackariah looked defeated and walked away. I felt envy coursing through him.\n\nI wondered if he could see with his third eye for a second. He had all these stories but the more he never seemed to repeat any of them made me suspicious.\n\nWe gathered in the chapel at noon. All the monks of the monastery were present.\n\nMax stood at the front of the room with his possessed bibles, beside a stack of mail.\n\n“We will start with the cesarians this time” Max said with a smirk.\n\nHe grabbed the sealed letter and opened it. He read it over then read it aloud.\n\n“We have investigated and found evidence of land octopus activity, we will send 1 legion.” Max said with a smirk. He looked briefly at grimoire Noir.\n\nHe grabbed the next letter off the table and opened it.\n\n“Abraham Lincoln will send 4000 riflemen and 400 cavalry.” MAx said, sounding impressed.\n\nThe native americans had already joined us, with a force of 500 braves this time.\n\nAfter the meeting we were off, other monks meeting us along the way as we made the journey to dixie.\n\nMany of us had horses while others marched. I rode Alziza.\n\n“The halo will make you much more effective in this fight. It lets you see in the dark you know” Alziza said ominously.\n\n“I know that” I chirped back. “Is that all you have to say wise ass?”\n\n“You’ll see.” Alziza responded ominously.\n\nWithin a few a days we started seeing alligator jaws sewn to all sorts of animals. Cows, pigs, dogs, people. \n\nAn alligator faced man and his dog watched us suspiciously then went inside their house.\n\nBefore long we were outside of Dixie making camp. In addition to the 500 braves we had a force of 222 monks, all with bolt action rifles.\n\nBefore long some klansmen came on horseback. They had a white flag waving.\n\nDeb was leading them and I could tell from her robes that she was a grand dragon. The image of the red dragon was painted in blood upon her white robe.\n\nI wondered if she recognized me, as it had been a long time and I had a beard now. She didn’t seem too.\n\n“Ya’ll we don’t need to fight, '' Deb said with a grimace, treachery clearly on her face. “Let us show you some southern hospitality. We’ve learned, we’ve grown, we aren’t eating the changelings. Why don’t ya’ll come into town and see for yourself what we have been up too.” \n\nDeb looked right at me through her thick glasses. She was basically blind and \n\nI saw no recollection in her eyes.\n\nMax looked her over thinking, and then grimoire Blank responded for him. “I see beyond the witch’s ploy. Take her offer, her trap is pitiful compared to Yahweh’s wrath.”\n\nWe gathered our rifles and followed them into town. There were children playing in ways that seemed out of place. Like they had been put there just to fool us. Despite this there seemed to be lots of them and my fears were eased slightly.\n\nWe walked by the factory and I could see klansmen cleaning their guns and giggling.\n\nWe ate dinner and it seemed to be free of any alleged changelings and we were shown to what seemed like nice quarters. We went to bed that night expecting Abraham Lincoln to arrive while we slept.\n\nI was awoken suddenly by screams and gunfire that night. I don’t know how long I slept, but it didn’t seem like long.\n\nI went to grab my rifle as Zackariah lazily got out of bed.\n\nThe door flew open and two gator dogs charged into the room, both biting into Zackariah. \n\nI grabbed my gun and shot one as they tore him apart. I loaded and shot the other one before it came at me.\n\nI heard screamed and gunfire coming from the other rooms and a gator faced man walked into the room. \n\n“Rufus? Doggo? NO!” He screamed.\n\nI shot him quickly and went into the hall. \n\nGator men and dogs were ripping monks and braves alike apart and I started to wonder at the book’s judgement.\n\n3 gator men looked at me and I knew my limits. I turned and ran down the halls with them following closely after me.\n\nI pushed open doors as I ran through complex, hearing gator voices taunting me from behind.\n\nEventually I came to a dead end and turned around. I saw 3 gator men and their dogs come in behind me.\n\n“You got 1 shot kid, who you going to kill?” the three gators laughed.\n\nThen a man came through the wall. He wore a cowboy hat and I could see his halo. He had a lit cigar in his mouth.\n\nHe pulled out a pistol with a revolving chamber and fired it 6 times in 3 seconds. Killing all 3 gator men and dogs.\n\nHe squinted at me threateningly. “You monks tipped us off in the first place. We saw the statues, but the culprit has not yet been found.” The man said, spitting on the ground. “You know since we’re here I think we're going to deal with this changeling abduction problem. These klansmen could be worshiping the land octopi for all we know.”\n\nHe reloaded his revolver. And looked at my rifle. \n\n“Primitive. You people live like animals.” The man said and phased through another wall. I heard 6 shots ring out almost immediately.\n\nI ran down the hall until I found my way outside. \n\nThere were checkpoints everywhere, klansmen fighting northerners with equal weaponry. Bodies lined the streets.\n\nI saw a gator bear tearing a northerner apart, and another licking his blood covered chops.\n\nThe halo gave me a distinct advantage on that moonless night as I crept in the shadows, avoiding the firelight.\n\nI came upon a courtyard and saw a number of klansmen gathered around Deb and all 3 Dora’s. I guess they had just rezzed her after last time.\n\nAlleged changelings were tied to posts and covered with honey and jam, an offering to some creature of the night.\n\nI then heard high pitched wailing screams, reminding me of banshees. \n\nThen I saw them, 15 foot tall monstrous women. They had their eyes missing and sword like fingers. I thought for a second about a book I had read on wendigos. It had said you just had to shoot them through the heart.\n\nI noted that with my halo on their heart was clearly marked. Alziza really was wise.\n\nThe wendigoes descended on the alleged changelings and stuck their sword fingers into them, sucking their blood like mosquitoes.\n\nI ran for my life, being as quiet as possible. I knew wendigoes could see in the dark too.\n\nI ran around the side of a building and saw the cowboy hatted man lying there dying. Two bullet holes in his stomach.\n\nHe looked at me and winked. “Hey kid, do you fear your creator? If you put me before him instead of letting me bleed out ill let you have my rifle.” He held the weapon up. “Loads the next bullet all by itself. Put the clip in and just pull back to empty the casing. REAL bolt action.” he said in obvious pain.\n\nI took the gun from him, said a prayer for the cesarion and shot him through the eye like he wanted.\n\nI moved quickly knowing the gunshot would give away my location.\n\nI came upon a group of 3 other monks, all with halos. \n\n‘That’s probably why they are still alive’ I thought to myself.\n\n“Ewan! Get over here!” one of them called.\n\nAs I approached them I heard wendigo screams and turned to see 8 of them charging down the streets towards us.\n\nMe and the other monks all fired, killing four of them. Then I fired 3 more shots emptying my clip. \n\nThe lone wendigo hit us before we could even reload. They moved at 3 times the speed of horses.\n\nIts hands sliced through two of the monks, and the surviving one ran as I reloaded. \n\nThe wendigo was upon him in no time, killing him. It turned to me as I finished reloading and I shot it through the heart.\n\nI ran through the streets keeping to the shadows.\n\nThe wendigos massacred the men without halos. They fired randomly at their bodies, doing no apparent damage. I fled from the carnage of Dixie running off into the overgrowth.\n\nI ran until I came into a clearing, seeing 4 wendigoes at the other side.\n\nI aimed my rifle and fired through their hearts one by one as they ran at me. The last one dropped to my feet and I reloaded. This was the last clip the cesarion had given me.\n\nI heard voices in the distance and followed them to find Max and Abraham Lincoln, surrounded by northern riflemen.\n\nThey had apprehended two of the Dora’s and had them tied up.\n\nMax and Abraham both took a jug of holy water from a spring Jesus had blessed down in South America and poured it on the Dora’s. They totally melted into a puddle of nasty smelling puss.\n\n“We have been repelled today, but we will return with 10 times as many troops!” Abraham Lincoln screamed. Rallying the troops.\n\nWe left with our tails between our legs and I wondered about the cesarians. It certainly didn’t seem like they sent an entire legion. Perhaps they had realized our ploy and sent a smaller force?\n\nAbraham Lincoln headed back up north. To rally as many troops as possible. Justice would come for the KKK, an American civil war had truly begun.\n\nWhen we reached the monastery I recorded the event so that my contemporaries as well as future generations may have a true account of the second changeling crisis that started the American civil war.",

        "text": "✨Every house has its secrets✨\n\nOn Halloween  night, Christian and his four friends Logan, Kyle, Wesley and Stuart were at a party celebrating them all making it into college. They were all playing beer pong and listening to music having the time of their lives. As time went on the party got louder and louder which lead to the neighbours complaining. At 03:30am Christian noticed flashing red and blue lights outside the house. His body started trembling as he was under age drinking but most importantly him and all his friends snuck out to go to this party. Christian screams “COPS!” and everyone dispersed into the back garden and jumped over the fence. The house they were at was just at the entrance of a forest, so Christian and the rest of his friends jumped over the fence and ran into the forest with no clue where they were going. After they got deep into the forest, one of Christians friends fell over and they all stop to catch their breath. Christian not wanting to stop starts overthinking about what his parents will say if they find out he snuck out, but as he traces back and forth he notices something carved out in a tree which said “ theres darkness deep inside all of us.” As he was reading this he heard a woman scream in the background, this scares him and makes him jump. His friends notice this and ask him what is wrong and what he is doing, but Christian turned to them looking like he saw a ghost. As he caught his breath he asks them if they all heard that scream, they all gave a wired expression and said that none of them heard anything, Christian starts thinking that it was just his mind playing tricks on him, and tells them all to come and look at the carving in the tree. Logan was the first to get up but his face got even more confused, Kyle, Wesley, and stuart got up and looked but there was nothing carved into the tree. They all looked at Christian and Stuart asked if he took anything while at that party, Christian got annoyed and said that he didnt and there was definetely something carved into the tree, after 5 minutes of them all arguing a random thunderstorm appeared out of no where, all 5 of them start to run off heading deeper into the forest. They cut through all the trees and bushes and enter a opening where they are now standing in front of a old broken down abandoned building. The building was made out of wood and most of it was covered in ash, and it had holes scaling from gun shots to huge chunks out of the wood. They all looked at eachother as to say “should we go in.” As lightning struck again, They took off running towards the front door, Wesley got close to the door and tried to open it but it wouldnt open, Stuart being impatient got annoyed about the rain and said “dude… the wood’s burned, its damp, and its god knows how old, the slightest touch could put a hole through it.” He then told Wesley to move and puched the door near the handle, and to everyone’s suprise he punched a hole right through it, he then looked at Wesley and said “told you.” As he unlocked the door, he slowly pushed it open, the door annoyingly creaked open which made everyone cover their hands over their ears. Stuart was the first to walk in, and everyone else followed slowly behind. The interior of the house was worse then the exterior, there was ash all over the floor, huge cobwebs in near enough in every corner of each room. Large cockroaches crawling through all the cracks in the floors and the walls, almost all the furniture and decorations in the house were burned, and what creeped the 5 boys out the most… There was blood slowly dripping from the floorboards in the ceiling creating a puddle of blood on the sofa, seeing this Logan Wesley and Kyle instantly changed their mind about staying in the house, they all said they don’t want to stay here but Stuart and Christian said they weren’t going back out in that rain. After 10 minutes of constant bickering, Kyle, Logan, and Wesley all took off running out the house, while Stuart and Christian stayed and explored. They were confused staring at all these wierd carvings in the wall, they were all sketches of a woman dressed in white, Christian made a joke about how the woman burned the house down and both of them started laughing, they laughed until the next drop of blood landed but this time it sent a cold shiver down both of their spines. They were both confused as to where the blood was coming from but most importantly what it was coming from. They both began to scale up the creepy/crooked staircase and as they got to the top, they approached the door to the room that the blood was dripping down from. Christian slowly reached for the handle and slowly opened the door…\n\nThank you for reading my story, If you liked it and want to read more of what I have wrote then click the link below:\n\nhttps://medium.com/@theunclassified801/the-woman-in-white-2ebe9f54515d",

        "text": "Hi, I'm Ansa (23 f). If you ever decide to move to an apartment building in the small city of [redacted] in Finland and find yourself living with this... thing.. in your building, there's a good chance it's the same creature we have named Lahja, meaning gift because we like irony in people's names in this building. Good luck, I hope this post helps you avoid some of my mistakes and realize to start preparing moving out as soon as you can.\n\nIt has the body, or rather looks, of a 10 year old boy with a face eternally twisted into a vague expression that could be interpreted as a grin or a silent wail of misery, but it's a dark mass, like a shadow. I don't mean that in the traditional sense, but it's the best descriptor I have. It's this dark shape in the middle of air, like it would walk or run around like a human, but it can be walked through and it can walk through physical matter. It looks like walking through a veil or glitching in a video game, but it doesn't feel like anything and it's real. I've seen them, even befriended some of them before, I call them shadow people, but this one. This one is no person.\n\nFor one, this thing seems to have power. It can interact with objects, I've seen it spinning the wheels of bikes in the common bike storage. It doesn't like to be seen doing that, it gave me a stare that made its message very clear: mess with it, make it mad, and I would regret it. It wouldn't be a surprise it could harm people too. I'm pretty sure it already has. Just a week ago there was a streak of blood as if a bleeding body had been dragged into the sauna on the ground floor, but when I followed it it just stopped and one of the janitors that have been hired by the building's owner, my and my neighbors' landlord, to clean the common areas daily, had already started mopping the blood away.\n\nIt also enjoys causing fear. 3 days ago my neighbors from down the hall, Pyry (37, a calm headed man of science, he had been a professor at the local university for a decade when he got hit by a bus and his memory never recovered, a favorite of the students for his calm and kind nature and amazing skills of explaining a doctorate level course's material so that someone who would usually struggle could understand enough to get a 3, the B of Finnish university grades) and Rauha (39, a woman painted neck to toe with gorgeous tattoos from her many work trips in her previous job as a tour guide, a tattoo for each new dangerous stunt from eating fugu to sky diving, now a full time caretaker and lover of Pyry), were coming home from getting groceries and Lahja had gotten into the elevator with them. They told me it had hijacked their eyes, shown them something horrible, they refused to tell what, until they were both, grown adults, screeching and crying in terror in the elevator and it had made a sound like a chuckle and disappeared. They've had a hard time sleeping since, experiencing those visions again any time they fell asleep. They told me yesterday that they were moving. They found an apartment in another city for a similar price as the one they live in now, \"it's smaller, but with more job opportunities around for Rauha, and this place making us go insane, we have to get out,\" they said. I can't afford to leave, as much as I want to. I have to try and hold on until I save enough to be able to quit or get a job in another city and hire movers. I doubt I want to or could afford a different place in this one anyway, it's just this building and student apartment buildings in this price range in this city. I'd be left with neighbors I never got to know and Lahja, basically by myself, in just 2 weeks as Pyry and Rauha will be moving on the weekend right before the month ends.\n\nToday I saw a neighbor, a man in his 20s, crying while we both were taking our trash out. I know he saw Rauha's body in the hallway too. From his look I know he knows that if anyone alerts anyone of it, Lahja will just get angry and come after whoever gets in its way. Whoever it sees. I don't know his name, or even which apartment he lives in, but I'm desperate. I'm scared and I know he is too. So I invited him over to my apartment, c99, for coffee, so that maybe we won't go insane like Pyry did. Maybe we could make it out of here.",

        "text": "To My Husband\n\n \n\nThis is a letter to my darling husband, oh where do I even begin?\n\nFrom the moment we first met, I should have known it was love. I remember the day you asked me to marry you and how speechless I was when you did it only after three months of dating. I remember when you got my entire family and your family to watch the proposal and I I knew I had to say yes. \n\n    The wedding at the courthouse was beautiful and I don’t even care that we didn’t have enough for a reception or a honeymoon. We just decided to have a small party in our house that we bought with my college savings. I didn't even care when we went back homs and you got drunk and decided to shoved my face in the store bought cake even though I asked you not to.\n\n      As I’m writing this words truly can’t express how much you mean to me and how much I love being your wife. I love the way you take charge in situations I have zero to no control in. I love the way you calmly explain to me things I understand or are well aware of. I love the way you devote your loving attention to those around you, especially other women. Sometimes your assistant. She always seemed like such a nice woman. Even though I don't understand why a flower shop owner needs an assistant.\n\n      I love the way you tell me that I’m cute for thinking anything wrong. I love the way you tell me I’m in my own head and that nothing is wrong. Because you’re a nice guy and nice guys would never cheat on their wife. I love the way you're so domineering in the bedroom. Even when I say no, you always find a way to say yes. I love the way when we end our nights you leave me speechless. I love looking in the mirror and seeing my body covered in your marks, so people know how much I mean to you and how I only belong to you. \n\n   But you know what I REALLY love about you? I love the way you eat my cooking. It's too bad you were allergic to cherries and I made you cherry pie for dessert. I love the way you flop to the ground trying to breathe. It's so cute watching you suffer the same way you made me suffer. I love watching your corpse sit in the trunk of your precious car as I drive to your pathetic lover’s house. It was always adorable to see your body sitting in the duffle bag you used for \"work\". I love the way your lifeless body looks when you're sitting in the backyard of your assistant's house.\n\n       I love the way the cops show up to her house and put her in handcuffs as the police dogs sniff for your body in her rose garden. I remember when you bought me those roses. I always said blood red roses were my favorite. I loved the orange jumpsuit your assistant wore when she was arrested for manslaughter. I love seeing the look on your mother’s face when I tell her all the wonderful things you did to me before your untimely passing. Your mother always favored you over your other siblings you mama's boy. \n\n      Oh how I will miss you my darling husband. May you \"rest in piece\". And how could I forget? I love cherry pie.",

Unfortunately, by the time anyone is looking for my help, things have already gone very wrong.\n\nOn January 5 one of the higher-ups in Forestry Services hired me to investigate the disappearance of Andrew Jensen. People go missing in national parks every year. However, there were oddities associated with this disappearance that left investigators disturbed.\n\nAndrew Jensen was in his mid 30's, fit, and approximately six feet tall. According to friends and family, he enjoyed the survivalist lifestyle and evangelizing. It was not unusual for Andrew to spend days in the forest alone, making Christian survivalist videos for his YouTube channel. Andrew's most watched video was how to trap and skin a rabbit for Jesus.\n\nAndrew was reported at risk by a friend who dropped Andrew off in the woods near Bright Lake on December 30.\n\nOn December 31, an unusual winter storm settled in the Bright Lake area. Local cell towers were damaged, and cellular communication in the area was cut off until January 3.\n\nRanger Station Bright Lake was closed for the season. After the storm, all roads leading to or from the station were blocked by 18 inches of snow. No vehicle marks were seen.  \n\nThe only evidence of wildlife or \"human\" movement in the area led from the north entrance of the Ranger Station along the Woodward path towards Bright Lake.\n\nTraces of a bioluminescent compound have been found in samples taken from the Ranger Station and the path. The presence of bioluminescent markers further corroborates the evidence from the smartphone.\n\nAlso, the \"person\" somehow melted through the lake's ice. The ice depth was measured at three inches on January 2.\n\nSamples taken from Bright Lake also tested positive for a bioluminescent compound.\n\nThe following recordings have been transcribed from a smartphone collected at Ranger Station Bright Lake on January 2.\n\nVideos and photos have been omitted at this time. The images are graphic and disturbing.\n\n\\------------------\n\nJanuary 1 12:32 am\n\nGod, this whole trip was a dumb idea.\n\nNew year, new me. Just drop me off in the woods, Brad. I'll be fine. I just want time to myself to pray.\n\nBla bla bla.\n\nI'm an idiot.\n\nI have no cell reception. The storm must have done something to the towers.\n\n(frustrated laugh)\n\nI'm so stupid. Why can't I make good choices?\n\nAt least I'm not cold. That's something. It's freaky, but it's something.\n\n(breathing)\n\nOkay, game face, let's do it.\n\n3, 2, 1.\n\nYo Yo Yo, it's your boy Andrew.\n\nMan, it was all so amazing before the storm started. There was snow on the ground, but it wasn't cold. And the lake, wow. I've never seen water do that before. The way it glowed. God makes amazing things.\n\nI mean, that light looked so blue and pure. It looked like what I imagine the holy spirit looks like. And with the mist rolling off the water, the whole thing looked alive. It felt alive when I jumped in. Electric.\n\nIt was a blessing. It truly was.\n\nI didn't think I'd be doing a polar plunge on New Year, but I wanted to start the year off right.\n\nGosh, it's coming down. The storm is just right on top of me.\n\nThe storm hit when I went under the water. I knew it was coming, but it wasn't supposed to be like this. It took the whole camp. I have no idea where my tent is or my folding chair. They just blew away. I didn't know snow tornadoes were a thing, but they are.\n\n(The sound of the wind made Andrew's words inaudible for 10 seconds)\n\nOkay, so what do I have. I'm wet, but I have clothes and my backpack, so there is food. Not much food but enough for a few days and some Sterno. And as always, Jesus is with me; I can rely on him.\n\nAlso, there's a rangers station up this path. As long as I can find a place to sleep out of the wind, I should be fine.\n\nSweet sweet sweet.\n\nTake a little B role and I'm good.\n\nGod, I hope I'm not getting Hypothermia. I feel hotter than I should.\n\nEnd Recording\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJanuary 1 3:25 am\n\nMade it to the Rangers Station. It's not much bigger than a shed. The wooden siding and metal roof almost make it look like a modern tiny home.\n\nHey, Jesus only had a manger, so I'm going to be okay.\n\n(Laughs)\n\nI had to break the back window to get in, but I'm sure they won't mind too much. It's not like I'm stealing. I'm just trying not to die.\n\nThere's a wood stove, a cot, a light, and one outlet. I think all the power comes from the Solar panels on the roof.\n\nI just lit a fire in the wood stove.\n\nI'm still fine temperature wise which is bazaar because I know it's freezing out here. But hey, god works in mysterious ways.\n\nThe station has power from some solar panel unit, but I might have to brush the snow off the panels if I'm here for a few days. I have my power brick with me, so I should be able to charge the phone even if I can't get the snow off the solar panels.\n\nI'm going to try to get some sleep but first, a big shout-out to my sponsor Jerusalem Granola.\n\nIf it wasn't for these little powerhouse bars and the faith and love they're made with, I'm not sure if I would have had enough energy to face this storm.\n\n(pause)\n\nI’m going to get so many views on this one.\n\nEnd Recording\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJanuary 1, 2:56 pm\n\nUm.\n\n(pause)\n\nThere's something wrong with my feet. I can see through the skin, like I can see the bone and muscles and stuff. And, my feet are all slimy and gummy.\n\nI have no idea what I got into.\n\nLike, is this drugs? Do drugs do this?\n\nI had some weed once. But that was in Colorado, and weed is legal there, so it wasn't like a sin or anything. Was it?\n\n(excited breathing)\n\nOh God\n\nI'm hot, like really hot. I took off all my clothes, and my feet were so gross.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI don't know.\n\nI can't stand. I tried to stand, but I couldn't. I can't put pressure on them. They are too soft, and they hurt.\n\nOh god, they hurt.\n\nWhat the heck is happening?\n\n(Deep breathing)\n\nStill no cell reception.\n\nStill no cell.\n\nOh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.\n\nPlease god.\n\nEnd Recording\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJanuary 1, 5:28 pm\n\nSo now my calves are clear. I can see through them, and I'm not on drugs.\n\nAnd golly gee Jehosaphat, My feet are extra slimy. It's like they're making their own snot. I'm a snot foot.\n\nAnd I can't walk because everything is all gross and soft.\n\nIt all just wobbles. I lift my legs up, and everything lower than the knee just flops around.\n\nWhy is this happening? What did I do? I’ve always been so good.\n\n(deep breath)\n\nOh god, I think my toes are gone.\n\n(wimper)\n\nOh God, what did I do?\n\nEnd Recording\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJanuary 1, 9:59 pm\n\nMy legs have fused together. They are very slimy, like a slug.\n\nI am Slug Man. The world's most worthless superhero.\n\n(Deep breath)\n\nI'm trying not to freak out.\n\nI ate a granola bar. It was okay.\n\nMy legs are jelly. Wobbly bits of blue goo. Gooey blue bits wobble too.\n\n(laughs)\n\n(deep breath)\n\nWhatever is happening is happening so fast. I can literally see the change creeping up my body.\n\nIt's coming for the boys next.\n\n(manic laughter)\n\nThe old twig and berries are gonna get gooified.\n\n(laughter)\n\n(inarticulate weeping)\n\nEnd Recording\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJanuary 1, 10:37 pm\n\nMy penis is gone, and I can see inside my stomach.\n\nI can see that granola bar. It's dissolving. I can see the pieces floating away. The pieces are turning into something else.\n\n(pause)\n\nI am the granola bar.\n\n(sigh)\n\nI'm still hot.\n\nStill hot.\n\nToo hot.\n\nI might be too hot.\n\nThe fire is out, and I'm hot.\n\nI slid off the cot because it was hot. I need more cold like the floor.\n\n(singing)\n\nSlug Man Slug Man doing the things a slug can. He's the man. He's Slug Man.\n\n(humming)\n\nI wonder if I can still poop?\n\nEnd Recording\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJanuary 1, 11:26 pm\n\nMy arms are fusing with my body, and it's getting harder to talk.\n\nI'm hot.\n\n(long pause)\n\nMom, and Dad, I love you guys.\n\nBrad, you're a good dude, even if you did drive me to my death.\n\n(raspy laughter)\n\nI'm just being a jerk now.\n\nI'm sorry I wasn't better.  \n\n(shaky breath)\n\nI'm sorry I wasn't better. I've been praying and thinking, and I know I've been focusing on the wrong things. So I'm sorry.\n\nI got so used to showing the world my faith that I forgot what that faith was supposed to mean. How I should hold others in my heart. Even if they can't help my brand.\n\nI don't know. I'm not saying this right.\n\n(deep breaths)\n\nI'd like to see that lake again if I can do one more thing. I want to go back. I want to see it glow. It really was magical.\n\nIsn't that stupid? That's so stupid.\n\nWhy? Why would I go back to that?\n\n(long pause)\n\nBecause it was beautiful.\n\nIt was beautiful, and that glow was alive. I know it was.\n\n(snotty gurgling sound)\n\nI'll leave my stuff here. I need to see that lake.\n\n(laughs)\n\nNew year, new me.\n\nEnd Recording\n\n\\------------------\n\nThe recordings suggested that the entity in the lake is alive or has a life force and can induce Therianthropy in its host. This, along with the lake's freshwater, bioluminescence, and the unusual behavior of the storm, led me to believe that Andrew may have had an indirect encounter with the Sabawaelnu during a mating ritual.\n\nI contacted the Mi'kmaq tribe in the region. I learned that the Sabawaelnu did conduct a ceremony over the New Year. The spawning was unusually successful. Resulting in a larger-than-normal clutch of eggs.\n\nMy contact at the Forestry Service has been notified.",

        "text": "I was excited to be living in the big city of Los Angeles. I had moved in a week earlier but was still busy with getting myself properly settled. So, I had no time to make new friends or look around. On this particular Friday evening, I had just replied to the last of the emails when I suddenly realized I was starving.\n\nI’m not the kind of guy that likes eating stuff outside since I knew how to prepare most of my favorite dishes. But tonight, I was willing to go out and let someone else do the cooking. After all, what’s the harm in stepping out of my lane for an hour or two? Fifteen minutes later, I was strolling down the streets in search of where I could get something tasty and healthy. Despite not wanting to take junk, I was willing to do some alcohol tonight.\n\nThe streets were bubbling with life as several young couples idled around in the distance, with many others bustling and chattering around. The streets were all lit up with light seeping through glass doors, walls, and windows of shopping malls and grocery stores. Now, this was a whole different scenery compared to my little town, back home in Cambodia, where most people had already retired indoors, leaving the streets to stray pets and a few other people who were returning home late from work.\n\nAfter second thoughts, I decided to use the opportunity to take in the scenery and also familiarize myself with the surrounding. For the third time, I looked at my watch. It read 7:25 P.M. I knew I had to be home on or before 10 o’clock. So, that was it! I had over two full hours to eat and have fun, maybe meet new people and make new friends.\n\nA few blocks from where I was, a spectacular banner with outstanding neon lighting caught my eye. It read: ***The invisible stripper.*** For half a minute, I forgot about the churning in my stomach. Now that was a really interesting feature. *How could a stripper possibly be invisible?* I stopped to read down. Close to the bottom right corner of the banner were the time and date. The show was set to begin at 8 PM. For some reason, I was grateful I had about thirty minutes to fill my stomach and find a sit inside the club hall before the party began.\n\nAt exactly 7:56, I had just finished a dinner of spaghetti and grilled chicken and was a few feet past the security check at the front door of the club. The interior of the club was dimly-lit with a handful of neon light strips here and there, giving the building some sort of tense ambiance. The lighting was such that you could hardly recognize a person 3 feet in front of you.\n\nThere were more than a hundred other men already seated in the hall when I entered. Luckily, I found a sit in the third row from the stage where I was sure I’d be able to see everything that needed to be seen. Quickly, I set an alarm for 9:30, then double-checked to see if I got extra cash just in case watching a stripper had its typical effect on me. Hopefully, there should be several ladies who were here for aroused men. *Spending a few dollars on a prostitute shouldn’t be too much damage.* At least she was going to keep me distracted from the severe insomnia I'd been battling since I arrived in L.A.\n\nThere was R&amp;B-type music playing in the background, reminding me of the good old days. A few minutes later, half a dozen puppeteers with black flowing tunics scurried onto the stage and stood with their backs facing the audience. The curtains in the background were black. Moments later, the stage lights came on, revealing long colorful socks and gloves, high heels, panties, and a bra. They were all perfectly aligned that they assumed the shape of an actual female stripper. The roar that erupted from the men now seated in the theater was enough to drown a referee's whistle.\n\nAlmost immediately, the music volume was turned to its peak, and the music changed to a preset song for the performance. The puppeteers were now moving their hands and feet as they skillfully manipulated the invisible stripper into a dance. The event was like nothing I had ever seen, whoever these puppeteers were, they must be the best at what they did. For about an hour, I watched as these men expertly manipulated the form on stage in different captivating dance moves. The performance was so captivating that I literally forgot that there were other men seated in the hall with me, my eyes were completely riveted on the stage.\n\nFor a moment, I thought I caught myself nodding in a half-sleep. I was surprised as it was quite unlikely that I fell asleep that early or so easily. Plus, my body system wasn’t supposed to find such a noisy environment conducive enough to fall asleep. I glanced over at my watch, it was 9:02. Then something else caught my eye, the man to my right was fast asleep and so was the man next to him. I looked to my left and noticed the same thing. As far as my eyes could reach, everyone was sleeping. It seemed strange but I dismissed the thought, concluding that they were probably too drunk. Then I returned my attention to the stage.\n\nThe stripper figure was still dancing when from behind the curtain a long pitch-black hand appeared, stretching into the audience in my direction. The hand stopped somewhere beside me, to my right, then returned back behind the curtains. It all happened in a split second. When I turned to see where the hand had stopped, the sleeping man on the seat next to me was nowhere to be found. The hand had snatched him!\n\nSuddenly, the crowd that previously appeared to be sleeping erupted in a thunderous clap. Everyone was now wide awake, including me. Slowly a chill ran down my spine, leaving my whole body engulfed in goosebumps. Looking back on stage, everything appeared to be normal. Then I noticed something that I didn’t see before. The breeze from the fans made one of the puppeteers' tunics sway widely. For a moment, it looked like there was nobody wearing the clothes. For a while I observed the other puppeteers and my fears were confirmed: there was nobody on stage!\n\nI was finding it hard to believe I and everyone else in the hall had just been hypnotized as I crawled through in-between the rows and columns of seats towards the exit. Whoever owned the hand that emerged from backstage had staged a hypnosis show in the guise of a stripper performance and was slowly consuming his audience. Thirty minutes later, I was lying on my back in bed imagining the fate of the hand’s victim. Silently, I swore never to attend any event that appeared too extraordinary as I slowly drifted to sleep.",

        "text": "I am generally a very observative person. I like to watch people go about their daily lives. One particular thing I do is watching other guests, when I am at the cinema. Their reactions to the movie, their quirks, just anything. I have been doing this for years. A few weeks ago however I began doing it at a small independent cinema in the city I live in. They show less mainstream movies and more independent films. Please don't judge me for how often I went there. Everybody needs a hobby.\n\nI was watching some drama and the reaction of other guests to the movie. In the middle of it something in front of the screen caught my eyes. I thought that two eyes were looking back at me. But once I looked at them directly I could just see the backs of the heads of other visitors. This happened maybe 3 or 4 times during the runtime of the movie. It was strange, but at this point I didn't think much of it.\n\nA few days later I was watching a mediocre sci-fi movie. I saw the eyes again. I looked at them. This time I could clearly see a young girl looking at me. She did not move. I was a bit disturbed. I thought maybe she wasn't really looking at me, but at the projector, or some other guest. Or maybe she just didn't like the movie. Honestly, I would get that. It wasn't really good.\n\nThe next day I saw no one looking at me in the cinema. Which was a relief. I was watching a horror flick. If someone had looked at me creepily I would probably have wet myself.\n\nOn the saturday of that week I saw her again. She sat much closer to me this time. And I was now sure that she was looking directly at me. She did not blink, at least not when I looked. I could only see her eyes above the backrest of her chair. But for some reason I imagined a creepy smile. Her gaze followed me even while I walked out of the room.\n\nI did not go back for a few days. I told myself that there were no good movies. Of course this were just excuses because I was too spooked. Well I went back on wednesday. And I was very relieved, when I did not see the girl and her unnerving gaze for the whole duration of the movie. I collected my jacket and the waste from my popcorn after the movie and turned towards the exit. There she was. Standing right in the exit. Her eyes fixated on me. I looked around, but there was no other way to leave the cinema hall. I exited my row, her gaze following me. I approached her standing in the exit. She was watching every step. She looked up, straight into my face as I stood next to her. She did not blink. For a moment I thought about saying something. I swallowed and just left.\n\nWell. Let's just say I have not been back since. Today I decided to just watch some old sitcom at home. It was an enjoyable evening. I can't pretend to be fully at ease, but not having anyone observing me for a few days certainly was relaxing. That was until a few minutes ago. I turned off the TV and just sat there for a moment, when I saw her. Her eyes like two points of light. Reflected in the TV, with her just past the windows of the living room. Now I am sitting here. Pretending to just scroll through my phone. The eyes are still there. I know that they are observing me, just like I always observe others. At some point I will need to stand up and go to bed. Will she be gone once I turn around or will she just keep watching? I don't know which I would prefer.",

        "text": "On average, the scariest room in any given building is the bathroom.\n\nYou can keep your basements, your attics, your cobwebby secret rooms hidden in the walls – every building, commercial or residential, has a bathroom, and you can’t avoid it. You’re going to have to pee eventually.\n\nA bathroom is made of hard, slippery surfaces and sharp edges and glass and bits of hardware sticking out of the walls. Ever slipped and fallen while taking a shower? I have. Nearly brained myself on the toilet. Bought a set of white sandpapery flowers to stick on the bottom the next day. \n\nMany of the surfaces are shiny, reflective, and sometimes fragile. Mirrors are creepy, sure, but have you ever watch your distorted reflection in the doorknob or faucet? Did you see the colors of your flesh, your clothing, your hair swim around in the stainless steel like oil floating in pasta water? Ever see your eyes looking back at you, pushed out of your face by the curve of the chrome?\n\nThese hard surfaces change the sound of things. The very sound of your own voice can resonate in a bathroom, echo off the walls, making you sound bigger than you are, big and hollow. Its hard to feel like you’re alone in a bathroom when your own voice doesn’t sound like it belongs to you. \n\nThe bathroom is full of chemicals - cosmetics, skin care, medications, soaps, deodorizers, cleansers of varying strengths for cleaning the actual room itself. Why are there cleansers in there? Because a bathroom is also full of germs, waste, and disease. This is the room where we evacuate our waste, our unwanted bodily fluids – saliva, vomit, feces, urine, pus, blood – and we wipe and wash it off and send it down the drains.\n\nThe drains. The bathroom is connected to a network of pipes that runs under your neighborhood. Some bring in clean water, the rest take away our dishwater, gutter water, waste water. We trust that they aren’t connected. The pipes come all the way from sources in the wild and connect to our homes, other people's homes, offices, factories, laboratories, treatment plants, cemetery sprinkler systems, sewers, morgues…\n\nWe like our water to come in clean, at our chosen temperature. As long as it comes out clear, we don’t question it, but there can be so much of it in a bathroom. People slip and fall on wet floors. IS that actually water on the floor, or is it some other fluid? Children drown in tubs. People get scalded by water that comes out too hot. And there are electrical outlets right next to the sink, where we plug in things that buzz and blow and burn.\n\n“What about outhouses?” you ask. “Those don’t have water or pipes.” No they don’t. You have to leave the safety of your home to use an outhouse. Fine, during the day, in good weather. But it could be raining or snowing or storming. You could get caught in there in a tornado – goodbye to you. You might need to pee in the middle of the night, and have to creep through the yard in the dark, dressed in your pajamas (if you even wear any). And then, once you get there, you put your naked butt over a dark, gaping hole full of piss and shit and used tampons and possible dead animals (or possibly live animals?) or anything else the hidden corners of your lizard-brain invents when you’re half-asleep and it’s trying to save your life.\n\nYeah, you have to get naked in a bathroom. You get naked and vulnerable in a room full of hard slippery surfaces and breakable reflective surfaces and water and electricity and echoes and sometimes really sketchy lighting that flickers or is too bright or forms odd shadows behind the toilets.\n\nYou are naked, and you are alone. The bathroom is isolated, both physically and socially. It’s not on the way to anywhere. Nobody goes in unless they need to use it or clean it. And we don’t talk about it: potty talk is not polite. It’s not a part of the stories we tell in public. It’s a private area where we lock the door and do private things.\n\nYou are naked, and you are alone – or you aren’t. A public bathroom has strangers in it, other people you’ve never met also coming into the strangely-lit echoing room to get naked and do private business. Or maybe not. Maybe they are in there for you. Maybe they are just hanging out in that stall, waiting for you to let down your guard, to turn your back to the rest of the room and wash your hands (because you’re a good person, of course YOU wash your hands), and are you paying attention to what is going on behind you, reflected in the mirror? Or are you trying to get the motion-sensor faucet to work so you can rinse the industrial soap off your hands?\n\nThe scariest room in any given building IS the bathroom.\n\n****\n\nI was seventeen when I started to hate bathrooms. We went on a family trip to visit my mom’s cousins in Newfoundland. (That’s pronounced noo-fin-LAND, underSTAND rubberBAND?) The whole trip was amazing, I mean, that place is BEAUTIFUL, especially in the late summer: all colorful little fishing villages and rocky beaches and lighthouses. It was like vacationing in one of those jigsaw puzzles your aunt likes to put together. \n\nBehind my great-uncle’s house was a little wood, all spindly old trees that diffused the sunlight into a dappled green haze over the mossy ground. Tiny, and I mean TINY, little flowers were everywhere in the grasses. Yeah, I was seventeen, but I always had an active imagination and it wasn’t hard to believe there were fairies living there. If you follow the path through the woods, it continues through shrubby fields of wild blueberries (we picked BUCKETS, and grocery store berries will never be the same) to an honest-to-goodness swimming hole in a stony little creek.\n\nI wish this story was about a fairy-infested woods in a foreign country very far from where I live.\n\nInstead, it’s about the bathroom in the basement of my mom’s cousin’s house, where we were staying. \n\nMost of the house was charming. My favorite part was the breakfast nook just off the kitchen. It was like a little greenhouse, walls and ceiling all made of glass, and there was a record player and a collection of Beatles albums (which I was ridiculously into at the time. Greenday who?). The food was amazing: brook trout with blueberry muffins, moose sausage, pickled mussels, fish and brewis, actual literal peas porridge in a pot (not 9 days old, though). \n\nThe basement was furnished with comfy couches, and it was full of movies to watch and musical instruments we weren’t supposed to touch. The walls were wood paneling, and sunlight came in diagonally through the glass in the sunken back door. I was given one of the bedrooms down there for the stay: a little double bed, more wood paneling, and a built-in desk next to the closet. No window. I thought it was cozy, a warm little cave to retreat to when I’d had my fill of sunshine and blueberries.\n\nNothing happened on the first night. I can’t think why anything should have happened at all, of course. I had no reason to expect anything other than a nice stay with some distant family in a beautiful new place. But then, we’d just arrived. We hadn’t been anywhere except the airport and in the car since our arrival in Newfoundland.\n\nThe next day we explored the woods and the swimming hole, of course, and I was in love with everything. I spent most of my childhood in West L.A. and had always romanticized things I’d only seen on TV or read about in books, like swimming holes and eating berries right off bushes and little wooded areas that weren’t fenced off or kept tidy by a parks department. \n\nThe second night, after a supper of salmon and potatoes and blueberry duff with caramel sauce, I went to bed in my little cave room, happily reliving the storybook day I’d had. I tucked myself in, turned off the bedside lamp, and fell asleep fairly quickly.\n\nI’m an introvert, and sometimes my bad dreams follow that theme: I’m surrounded by people and can’t get away for a quiet moment to myself. The setting of this dream, appropriately, was a family reunion of some kind, where there were lots of people and we were all staying in one cousin’s home. Sound familiar? In the dream, of course, it was a different home and different people, but it felt like a Familiar Place and people I knew. \n\nIn the dream, I had to get changed – I have no recollection of the reason or the details of what I was already wearing, but getting changed from pajamas into day clothes fits the situation. I gathered my day clothes and went into a bathroom to get changed.\n\nI want to make it clear that my dream-self interpreted this bathroom as Normal, at least while I was dreaming, but you’ll see when I describe it that things that are Normal in dreams are sometimes the weirdest things to the waking mind. \n\nThe bathroom had a fairly standard layout. As I entered, the bathtub complete with shower curtain was on my left, then at the end of that was the toilet, which faced my right. The sink and mirror were at the end, facing the door. The floor had no little rugs or mats, but was covered in about an inch or so of some yellow chemical liquid (my dream-self just somehow knew it wasn’t urine) but it didn’t bother me because my feet stepped right through it like it was a hologram. Hanging all over the room – from the towel racks, the shower curtain rod, the light fixtures, nailed to the wall – were pieces of dead iguanas, tied up neatly with red thread. \n\nDream brain said this was all Normal, so, unbothered, I locked the door and stepped over to the counter to set down my pile of clothes, ready to begin changing. \n\nSuddenly, there was a noise from behind me: the soft plasticky rustle and sliding shinkshinkshink of a shower curtain being pulled back. I looked up into the mirror, horrified that I’d intruded on somebody’s shower time (they really should have locked the door though!), and saw someone in a shower cap peeking out at me. \n\nThey had no face.\n\nI spun around to apologize and leave, but there was nobody there. I was TERRIFIED. Yellow floor liquid? Iguana bits? No face? Fine, normal, all good. Person in mirror but not in the room? EEK. I ran from the bathroom straight into waking up.\n\nSo here’s the part where the chilling mixes with the hilarious for a bit: I woke up in a strange pitch-dark bedroom, from a nightmare about a BATHROOM, every nerve on edge and my bloodstream full of adrenaline – and I had to PEE. \n\nBADLY.\n\nGo ahead and laugh. It was not funny at the time. \n\nI couldn’t even MOVE yet, and my bladder was screaming at me. Some remnant of logic broke through the panic and told me that it was JUST a dream, and I should probably do what I could to avoid wetting my mom’s cousin’s guest bed, but my panicked lizard-brain was convinced that the covers were keeping me safe from the mutilating horrors that surely awaited me in the darkness. I HAD to get a light on, or I’d never safely get out of the bed. \n\nThe bedside lamp was closest. Slowly, carefully, I slid my right hand under the covers towards the edge of the bed and my only chance of survival. I steeled myself, then quickly darted my hand out, turned on the lamp, then pulled my hand back under the covers to safety as the little yellow bulb chased the shadows into the corners of the room.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nMy next task was to turn on the overhead light, which was much brighter, and make the room completely safe. I coiled my muscles, focused on my target, then quickly sat up and reached for the lightswitch on the wall. Success! The light flooded on, and while I dove back under the covers just in case, the light chased the rest of the shadows away.\n\nWith the room safe, I could now strategize how to get to the bathroom – the LAST PLACE ON EARTH I WANTED TO GO – safely.\n\nI remembered the switch for the hall light was just outside my bedroom door, so I stood by the door, one hand on the knob, the other ready to zip through the crack and turn on the light out there. 1, 2, 3, OPEN! SWITCH! RETREAT! SLAM!\n\nI was still safe, the shadows in the hall were retreating, and I somehow didn’t wake anybody up.\n\nI peeked out of the door. The hallway was deserted. I slid out of the room and plastered my back to the wall. They can’t sneak up on you if your back is to the wall. I inched down the hall, starting to laugh a little (a VERY little) at how cartoony I must have looked. Parts of the hall opened up into the main room in the basement, but it was getting easier to ignore the shadows. That room wasn’t the scary one, after all. The scary room was the one I was heading towards: the bathroom.\n\nThis bathroom was smaller than the one in my dream. The little boxy shower with a floral curtain that faced the door was next to the toilet, which faced the sink and mirror. A fuzzy mint green mat and more wood paneling clashed a bit with the black tile on the floor. On the toilet tank, a frizzy-haired little doll, one plastic arm raised in greeting, concealed a fresh toilet paper roll beneath her frilly crocheted skirts. The counter was bare except for a glass dish that cradled several decoratively molded soaps, so dusty it was hard to tell one pastel shade from the next.\n\nNot that I looked closely. I had my eyes on that green mat and the black tiles. I turned on the light, waited another bladder-torturing moment, then entered the bathroom. I did not look at the shower. I did not look at the toilet paper doll. I looked nowhere NEAR the mirror. I kept my eyes on the lights reflected in the shiny black tiles like so many stars and did my business – the RELIEF!! – as quickly as I could. I stood, flushed, then blindly washed my hands. I felt the mirror and the shower curtain, as if they were watching me, daring me to look, just a glance, just once. \n\nNope. \n\nI slipped back into the hall, turning off the bathroom light just before closing the door. \n\nWith my poor bladder finally empty, and my adrenaline finally fading, I inched back down the hallway, now definitely laughing at myself at how cartoony I looked. \n\nIt really had only been a dream. My bladder was empty, the bed was still dry, and I had a ridiculous story to tell my siblings in the morning.\n\nJust as I reached for the bedroom doorknob, from down the hall, behind the closed bathroom door, I heard a soft, plasticky rustle and the sliding shinkshinkshink of a shower curtain being pulled back.",

        "text": "Some time ago, I began to dream this one dream. It was always the same with maybe little differences here and there. But the theme and the feelings I had were always the same. And each time I would wake up with my heart beating so loudly I can hear it in my ears and my whole body shaking.\n\nThe dream was about a little girl sitting on a bench in a park, similar to the one near the city I moved in some time ago. \nShe seemed upset, covering her little face with her little hands and cried. I heard her wheeping and saw how her tears fell as I watched her from distance. She was all alone, and I felt sorry for her. Somehow I wanted to help her, but I didn't know how. Suddenly I felt so helpless. \"Maybe, I could say at least some nice words and try to comfort her\" I thought to myself. \n\nI took a few steps forward and raised my hand for greeting, calling \"Hey\" in her direction. She didnt look up. I decided to take a few more steps forward. As I was moving, here wheeping was getting clearer and the pain she was suffering louder with every step I took. \n\nFinally I stood in front of her, maybe two meters close. She didn't look up once the whole time, nor she seemed to notice me. In fact, she didn't seem to notice anything around her.\n\n\"Hey\" I said again. Her wheeping was quietly and certain at the same time.   Suddenly, she stops, loosing up a little bit of her hand and body state.\n\n\"Hey, you are not alone\". I said, smiling and relieved she finally noticed me. I crouched down, trying to make it more comfortable.\n\nShe rubbed her face and looked up, revealing her face, which was all covered from tears that looked like they were falling since ever, without pause, building several layers in between. The eyes were red around from crying, filled with large teardrops which were close about to drop.  Her mouth was a red line, which seemed to be weighted at both ends and pulled down endlessly on each site of its corners. \n\nHer face was the enbodiment of pain, how I 'd never seen it before in that form, making me wince immediately and loosing my crouched position, caused through the imbalance. \n\nI looked at her with confusion for a moment. I was clearly disturbed but at the same time very attached, cause I felt her pain going through me like a thunder. I must have looked very upset and suddenly I feared, I would scare her and make her cry again.\n\nBut she was looking at me with the same expression, unchanged as before. Furthermore, she was rather calm and I noticed she was suddenly holding something in here hands. It was similar to an envelope. She reached one hand to me, the envelope in it, waiting for me to take it from her.\n\nI wondered what it was and why it was meant for me. I'd never seen this girl before in my life. Nevertheless, after short hesitation, I finally took it. \nI could feel there was something in it, and  I took a quick look to the girl, before I opened it. \n\nFrom here on, all I knew is that everything went numb in the dream around me. Within a second I felt shattered inside. \nTears went down my cheeks. \n\nThe girl continued to cry, bloody tears, which dropped soundless onto my hands and the envelope.\n\nUsually at this point I would wake up with a scream from my dream. However, I could never remember what was in the envelope, nor why it was so disturbing to me. \n\n***\n\nNow it is afternoon, and I was preparing myself for a walk in the park here in the neighbourhood. I use to go regularly there shortly after the dreaming began,  just to sit for a while on a bench similar from that in my dream, watching little birds and other animals and enjoying nature around me. However, the main reason why I was here, was me hoping to remember what was in the envelope.\n\nSometimes I would drift away for so long  that the sun was going down already until I notice. \nOther times, I believed hearing passengers calling to me from distance, asking if everything was ok. \nThese moments increased from time to time, as far as i can tell.\n\nI began to wonder, if I wont return some time. I could feel I was so near from resolving. But everytime it seemed to be almost done, it began to move away again, leaving me frustrated and helpless, with nothing else left for me than sitting there and crying, hoping one day the girl will come and solve the mystery.",

        "text": "\nMy friend has an aunt, we'll call her 'Sherry', who is married to 'John'.\n\nSome background info: Sherry is in her mid 50's, she married John about 6 years ago, a successful Engineer with two daughters who are in their 30's (also married). John and Sherry have been happily married without any oddities that we know of - an average couple. They live in a major city in Western Canada.\n\nHere's where things start to get weird..\n\nAbout 48 hours prior to me writing this post, John went to pick up Sherry from work like any other day. Upon Sherry entering the vehicle, John handed her pre-signed divorce papers completely out of the blue. No arguments, no explanation.. nothing. He made Sherry sign the divorce papers in the car. After Sherry was pressured into signing the papers John promptly left the car, keys in the ignition, he just left, presumably took a city bus somewhere. Sherry, in absolute shock did not follow John unfortunately so we can't comment on where he went or if he was picked up by someone from somewhere.\n\nThis seems like a normal divorce story until we start delving into some other details - Conditions of the divorce: John left Sherry everything! His car, his bikes, his damn clothes, the house... Everything. He didn't even grab his passport and left his damn phone in the car. All he has on him is the clothes on his back and any cash/personal equities he presumable has. Here is where things get weird, the same day, John's 2 daughters did the exact SAME thing to their respective husbands. Divorced them on the spot, no explanations, no grabbing personal items. Just disappeared presumably altogether. They have all deleted their respective social media accounts.\n\nI guess my question is... What the fuck?\n\nThe only thing we can think of is that they all joined a cult? But which one? and why?\n\nI will try to add updates as I learn more, this is all extremely recent so if you have any questions please ask and we will try to get answers and update, as of now this is entirely all we know.\n\nP.s - My friend's dad got a free motorcycle because Sherry didn't know what to do with it\n\nUpdate 2023-01-08 - Thank you for your questions, I will try to address what I can\n\n\\- John's daughters did not have any kids\n\n\\- John is also in his mid 50's\n\n\\- In terms of the conversation that happened between John's daughters and their respective spouses, I don't know much yet. I will add info as is trickles in from Sherry and as we learn more (Even though this happened 48 hours ago, we've only found out today)\n\n\\- John and his daughters are Caucasian, born in Canada. Daughters are from a previous divorce evidently... John had full custody of his daughters that he raised\n\n\\-The divorce papers: Yes there is due process when it comes to finalize a divorce, I guess legally they are 'separated' but papers were presented to Sherry in the car, our understanding is that he didn't actually care what Sherry did with the papers. He was in a rush",

        "text": "   \n\nI’d always been a bit of a jumpy person, prone to letting my imagination run wild at the slightest hint of a strange noise or unexplained shadow. But even I had to admit that the past few nights had been particularly unsettling.\n\nI had been hearing strange noises coming from outside my window, and no matter how many times I checked, there was never anyone or anything there. It was as if the sounds were coming from thin air. I lived alone in a studio apartment. By choice. I wasn’t a fan of roommates. Or romance, after my boyfriend of two years vanished into the night with our cat and the next month’s rental payment.\n\nI tried to brush it off as just my overactive imagination getting the better of me, but the feeling only intensified as the days went by. It was like a voice in the back of my head, constantly reminding me that something was not right.\n\nOne night, after tossing and turning for what felt like hours, I finally decided to investigate. Wearing my former boyfriend’s XL Pendleton shirt, I padded over to the window, my heart racing in my chest.\n\nAs I peered out into the darkness, I saw a pair of glowing eyes staring back at me. I froze, my whole body going rigid with fear.\n\n\"I want you in the worst possible way,\" a voice whispered from the darkness.\n\nI screamed and ran back to my bed, pulling the covers up over my head as if they could somehow protect me from whatever was out there. I lay there, trembling in the suffocating dark until dawn began to peek through the covers.\n\nWhen I finally worked up the courage to leave my quilted womb, I found that all of windows in the apartment were nailed shut. There was no way to escape whatever was stalking me.\n\nI tried to call for help, but my battery was dead. I was completely cut off from the outside world, with no way to get help.\n\nAs the days went by, my fear turned to desperation. I was convinced that whatever was after me was not human, and that I was never going to make it out alive.\n\nI began to hear the voice more and more frequently, hissing threats of what it would do if it ever got its hands on me.\n\nI knew I had to find a way out, but every time I tried to escape, I was thwarted by some unseen force. It was as if my apartment itself was against me, trapping me within its walls.\n\nOne night, as I lay awake in bed, the voice suddenly stopped. I held my breath, waiting for it to start up again. But there was only silence.\n\nI slowly sat up, my eyes scanning the room. And that's when I saw it - a figure standing in the corner, its eyes fixed on me.\n\nI let out a blood-curdling scream as the figure began to move towards me. I kicked and flailed, trying to get away, but it was no use. The creature was too strong.\n\nAs it loomed over me, its hot breath on my face, I closed my eyes and waited for the end. But it never came.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the creature was gone. I was alone again in the apartment, with no sign that it had ever been there.\n\nI lay there, shaking and sobbing, until the sun rose. And when it did, I knew what I had to do.\n\nI gathered together all of my furniture and blocked the front door. Whatever had been stalking me was still out there, wanting me in the worst possible way. But I was stronger than it gave me credit for. I would not be its victim.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nAs I slowly circled the apartment, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was following me. I kept looking behind me, but there was never anything there. The creature was somehow able to stay hidden from my sight.\n\nI knew I had to get as far away from it as possible, so I began running. After forty or so laps, my bare feet began to hurt. I stopped at my closet. Chest heaving, pouring sweat, I laced on my Adidas running shoes. They were worn, but still sturdy. My go-to running shoes, I’d put many miles on them, running with my former boyfriend over hill and dale, breathing in sweet air and his masculine scent. \n\nShoes tied tight, I picked up my pace. But no matter how fast I ran, I sensed the creature was getting closer and closer. I could feel its presence, almost as if it was my boyfriend, prodding me ahead, pushing me beyond the limits of my endurance. My lungs ached. But I wasn’t about to give up now. I ran harder, banging against the walls, increasing my lap speed.\n\n\"I will always be with you,\" the voice whispered in my ear. \"I will always want you in the worst possible way.\"\n\nI let out a scream, stumbled and fell head first, crashing into the pile of furniture I’d shoved against the door. An antique oak dresser my mother had given me toppled over, pinning me to the floor.\n\nHelpless, dazed and disoriented, I felt a pair of cold hands wrap around my neck. \n\nMy own. \n\nSlender and smelling of lavender, yet incredibly strong. \n\nFingers insistent, pressing hard against my larynx. \n\nThe pain was unbearable. I tried to scream, but couldn’t, my vocal cords trapped beneath my ever-tightening grip.\n\nAnd then, everything went black.\n\nI awakened, gagging. Inching to the kitchenette, I found a steak knife, severed an electrical cord and tied my wrists together. Instinctively, I knew it had to be done. \n\nI was my own worst enemy. I had absorbed my fears and then become them. There was no Creature hovering outside the window.\n\nThe Creature.\n\n~~Was.~~ \n\nIs. \n\nMe.\n\nAnd how, in the name of all that is good, can I escape *me*?",

        "text": " My father is a Professor of Anthropology. He had been very excited a few days ago when he was able to bring home a large crate from the University. He had been going on and on that night that he was about to make a name for himself; that he would change our understanding of our existence or whatever. He wouldn’t stop talking. Mom just kept smiling and nodding.\n\nSince then, I’ve only heard him at night when he turns on his record player and starts banging around. When he’s on the verge of something he thinks is monumental, it's always loud, but this time it sounds like a construction zone. My room is directly above his study, so I haven’t been getting much sleep.\n\nAt first, my mom seemed annoyed about how much time he was spending in his study. She would go in to check on him and bring him food, but that stopped two days ago. She’s been acting very distant. Her face is drawn and her skin is ashy. I’ve tried to talk to her and every conversation is very short. The other night, I heard dad laughing. He didn’t stop for almost an hour. \n\nThis morning, a disgusting smell woke me up. Like something really sweet that’s starting to turn and it’s making the air hard to breathe. I walk down to the kitchen and before I can grab something to eat on my way out, I hear a strange noise from the study. I knock on the door and I hear the noise again. Something that sounds like a bunch of mice running along the wood floor.\n\nThere’s a hard knock at our front door, and it’s Brandtly, my father’s research assistant. He hurries past me, talking about something my dad took from the university. Something he shouldn’t have taken. He runs to the door of the study and pounds his fist against it. He tells me to stand back and busts the door in. The smell is overpowering. I want to scream when we walk inside, but I’ve lost the ability to do anything but shake. I’m trying to catch my breath.\n\nMy mother is in the corner, hanging from a rope. Her eyes are missing. One of my father’s arms is sitting in a pool of blood on his desk next to an open empty crate. Blood and dirt are everywhere. Pages torn from my father’s books have been tacked up all over the walls with notes scribbled on them. Above the fireplace in a white dripping paint, are a bunch of symbols that look like an ancient language, and large mounds of dirt are on either side of the fireplace. He’s dug a tunnel downward in the fireplace. \n\nThe smell is coming from the hole and there’s a faint light coming from somewhere in the darkness. I can hear my father’s laughter coming from somewhere deep inside the hole followed by other voices and sounds that don’t sound human at all.",

        "text": " Just going to start writing. I read that it can be good for someone like me. Someone with impulse problem. No matter what the subject. Just like when I came home and instantly started sweeping and mopping. Wtf? What’s that going to do to fix the root of the problem.\n\nI want to find the root of the problem. Is it a trauma? I don’t think I have any..I think? I don’t know. A barely know who I am anymore. Who am I becoming? Who have I been?\n\nEver since 16,17,18 I’ve been on a path. A path to destruction. Freedom is what’s killing me. Do I need to be on a rope like a dog? I think so. I may bitch and complain. But you know what, at the end of the day it’s what’s best for me.\n\nI feel lonely. I’ve been lonely for almost my entire life. Am I lonely because who I am? Am I lonely because I tend to push others away? I’m certain I’m about to lose my only best friend in the world sometime. I just can’t get my head on straight. It’s so silly to say that at 30. But it’s okay. I can be honest with myself. I am the problem.\n\nBack to lonely…it’s strange I’m lonely, because I’m usually the life of the party. I have such a kind heart. I just don’t always think straight. I’m really going to start digging deeper into my mind to see if I can find something that can help me get to a solution. My solution is needed. It’s necessary. I want it, I must have it.\n\nUntil again 📷\n\nBack again. Same night. My kids are my absolute pride and joy, but Cynthia was right and has been. I’ve been constantly putting myself ahead of them. My happiness over them. Because when I tend to try and make myself happy, it hurts them, or others in the process. What is it called when someone hurts others in the process of making themselves happy? Idk. I’ll research some.\n\nWe’re sitting in the basement, kids are having a blast playing the racing game. They’re talking so much crap between themselves. It’s hilarious. It reminds me of me and my friends back in the day.\n\nI am still stuck in my head though. Having her not home is killing me, I don’t feel whole. I know she’s fine, I know she’s relaxing. But she knows that her time away from me, absolutely kills me. I wonder if she feels the same when I go away? If so, that’s terrible. And I wish she would tell me.\n\nI want her to tell me more stuff. I want my best friend. But am I even her best friend anymore?\n\nI want to get back to that strong feeling we had. A feeling that never made me feel weak. I feel really weak right now. I’m willing to give anything for it. Whatever the cost. I am, and will do better. This utter disgust I have in my gut. Is life ruining. I can’t and will no longer allow myself to feel this way.\n\nIs it free time that hurts me? Do I need to fulfil my entire life with stuff so that I don’t have time for things? I don’t know.\n\nWhat I do know is Cynthia doesn’t deserve this. I’m just a guy who provides a roof over her head and food. I’m not a husband. Hell. I’m a half wit father at best. But whats crazy is, when not in these stressful situations. I think I’m normal. Am I normal? What is normal? I don’t know. Life’s just crazy. I wish I could say I know what’s going on in life but I don’t.\n\nI’m so lost. Not sure what to do, what to say anymore. I remember a time where my mind was so clear and beautiful. What happened? I need to dig back down deep and get into things.\n\nOnce again. Goodnight 📷\n\nSitting down. It’s dark. The dreamless nights. The noise I just heard. Is it me? Should I be scared?\n\nNew day 📷  \n\n\nI owe it to myself. And only myself. I’ve been angry at myself thinking I wasn’t good enough for them. But I am. But it won’t show until I can prove it to myself. Those shadows that creep in your soul start to slowly eat you alive. One minute at a time. It shows. It doesn’t show in an instant. It takes time. But once that hourglass has emptied, time can be over. But there is some positive that can come from it. You can turn the hourglass over. You now have the skills to stop that ticking time bomb. The cold wind has stopped blowing. The blizzard of fog. Everyone has the experience, it’s how you deal with it that can prove if you’re more powerful than the winter storms that blur the vision. A trek, a journey, life. It’s easy to look into someone else and tell that what they’re missing, and how to fix it. But it’s much harder to look into yourself and realize it. Even harder to find the way to make it stick. To make it work. Trials and tribulations are out here in-front of us to prepare for the inevitable. Habits are made to make yourself feel comfortable. But comforting isn’t always what’s best. It may be what’s best for you, but life isn’t all about you. It’s how you can put that one ounce of change into the world. If and when all else fails stop and think for a minute that you have not failed, you just had an experience. Our lives lead us in so many different pathways. It’s up to us to chose which one is the right one. It’s hard to explain that we have to choose for us, but ultimately it’s for others. It doesn’t make sense, but it does. Like a leaf in autumn when it falls off the tree. It falls from the tree so gracefully, but no one knows where it’s going to land. You think it’s by accident, but in reality, it was meant to land in that very exact spot for a reason. The reason you may never know, maybe you do. If you do, then you understand what this means. It sometimes takes days, months, years, to make sense of it. But one day if all in good faith. You will understand. A jellyfish floating in the water, it looks just so random. It seems lifeless, that it’s just there floating away wherever the water takes it. But that is so wrong. The jellyfish knows where it’s going and how to get there. It may just use the water as a tool. Sometimes the water pushes against it. But it doesn’t stop trying to get where it belongs.\n\nWe all are the leaf, and jellyfish. I have been the leaf falling, but instead of letting nature take me on her course and put me where I belong, I’ve tried altering my landing. Why? I’m not sure. But I will find the answers. Once I find out, I promise to myself that I’ll listen. Not talk. Just listen.\n\nListen to the way the trees talk. Every bird chirp, every wave of water that makes a noise. It all means something.",

        "text": "We never meant to actually summon a demon. Sure, we read the words, followed the book, and went through the ritual, silly as it was. But I’m confident none of us thought it would work. Our intentions were, I don’t know; we were just like any group of kids who look into a mirror and dare a monster to come out. \n\nThe only difference is it worked for us. \n\nIt started at a yard sale. Danny, Rache, Sofia, and I were cruising Rache’s neighborhood without anything particular to do. We were in Rache’s neck of the woods because–even though she hated to acknowledge it–she lived in a borderline rich area. Right there at the line. In contrast, Sofia and I were both out in the sticks. Danny essentially lived in a damn warzone. When we saw the yard sale set up on the lawn of a small mansion, nobody needed to say a word; I knew to pull right over just like I knew we wouldn’t be spending any money. Shoplifting from the rich folks was its own reward no matter what you walked away with. \n\nI remember the morning was warm for September, the sky was clear and candy blue, and every green tree and lawn on the street was perfect. You could smell the fresh-cut grass dying and drying, releasing that last gasp of summer. That was that final truly carefree morning I would ever have. Funny how you rarely see the major changes coming until you’re already around the corner. \n\nSofia and I were talking again that morning, which was good. We’d dated the year before and the breakup wasn’t great but we’d spent the summer putting patches over the worst of it. She and Danny walked along the aisle of the huge yard sale together. They would lift and examine item after item; blenders and bowling shoes and lamps and glass lemonade pitchers. I saw Danny slip a bottle opener shaped like a surfboard into his pocket. The middle-aged lady sitting in a lawn chair under an umbrella didn’t notice. Fancy yard sales had terrible security back in those days. \n\nI was drifting between the foldout tables piled high with all of the junk and treasures laid out in clean rows. My headphones kept out the sound of everything but Weezer. I know *Pinkerton* and *Green Album* have their fans but *Blue Album* will always be my favorite. Rache was walking next to me, close enough that I could smell her shampoo, something tropical, with hints of orange and vanilla. She was wearing a tank top and I could see the tan lines on her collarbones, sharp and pale as a ceramic knife. We’d gone to the beach as a group a lot that summer. \n\nRache and I were walking close but not quite touching, though our shoulders would brush together every few steps. All of that is so clear to me even now, almost thirty years later. It was a good day. And then I saw the book. \n\nThe cover was a cracked-leather red with black letters so faded they were barely shadows. It looked old. I picked it up and thumbed through the dried-out pages quickly. They were yellow, brittle, and smelled like cinnamon. The book was small and fit easily into my back pocket. I glanced at the woman in the lawn chair; she appeared to be sleeping. \n\nWe went over our haul later in the car. Danny had the stickest fingers. He managed to grab all kinds of knick-knacks and toys and an actually pretty quality stainless steel Zippo. That guy always was the quickest and most ambitious, maybe a side effect of growing up with garbage parents who couldn’t be bothered to watch him. Sofia snagged a belt and a velcro wallet. Rache didn’t take anything, which resulted in a round of teasing. And me, I just had the book. It would be the biggest hit of our take, with Danny’s Zippo a distant second, but I wouldn’t know that until we took some time to study it.\n\nAfter the yard sale, the four of us went to Sofia’s place because her parents were out of town for the weekend. We picked the liquor cabinet and sat out on her deck staring off into the woods and going through my new book. The reason for the excitement was the subject the book covered: witchcraft. Specifically, the little red volume focused on demons, demonology, and demonic communication. There were dozens of smeared charts and illustrations and…portraits. None of us knew what language the text was written in but Rache guessed Latin or Greek or something similar. \n\nRache figured she could sound it out. Apparently, she went to a nice private school before something happened that caused her parents to move and downgrade to our town. It wasn’t supposed to be a big thing, just a fun distraction before we all got a little drunk. We’d make a fire, pick a ritual from the book, have some s’mores, then maybe go drink a couple dozen beers in the forest. I remember the wind plucking leaves from the trees above the deck while we got ready. I remember the light fading, the sun draining into the horizon, stretching out the shadows around us. But most of all I remember the silence. It was like the forest was holding its breath.\n\nAs for the ritual itself, *that* is still blurry to me. Rache read from the book, we had a campfire, candles…I think maybe there was incense. Or, more likely, potpourri stolen from Sofia’s bathroom. It smelled (and burned) terribly. The moment I remember with the most clarity is when we took turns pricking our thumbs with a pocket knife Danny lifted from the garage sale. Just a few drops of blood each, drawn and dripped into the fire; that’s all it took to kill us. The silence after we were done was deeper and colder than anything before. There was no sound of wind or snap of fire. It was dusk but there were still a few lingering lines of dull sunlight on the ground. Sofia was the first one to panic. I saw her mouth moving but couldn’t hear what she was saying. And then everyone was trying to talk, to scream, but we were all muted. \n\nFor a long minute, I thought I’d gone deaf. Then all of the sound came rushing back and the four of us pulled ourselves together slowly. We were rattled but unhurt. The night was damaged though it wasn’t ruined. Our ritual and the silence were blips and we did our best to get back on track after. I’m glad we did. I’m glad we got to enjoy the rest of that night. It was the last time the four of us would all be together alive in one place.\n\nDanny dropped Rache off at her house after the bonfire then he and I went to the park for a bit to smoke. I could walk home from there and offered to let Danny crash at my place so he wouldn’t be driving but he promised he’d sleep it off in his car first. The walk home was nice, at first. It was a clear night with a half-moon that splashed shadows across the road, cool but the breeze didn’t have that winter edge to it yet. I’d swapped out Weezer for R.E.M. and was just getting into *Nightswimming* when I thought my WalkMan died. \n\nThe song dropped; I waited, slowing down and then stopping to tap at the big yellow brick, wondering if something was wrong with the cassette. After a moment, I pulled my headphones off and realized that I was standing in a strange, perfect silence. There was no sound of rustling leaves or my feet shifting on the road or crickets or anything at all. I tried to speak but my voice was muted. \n\nSomething moved at the end of the street. It was difficult to see clearly, and I was still distracted by the unexplained silence, but my first thought was, “*did a horse get out from a field?*” The figure was massive and could easily be mistaken for a horse. However, when it stepped under a streetlight, I saw that it was some kind of dog. The biggest dog I’d ever seen, for certain, and it was walking towards me slowly. \n\nI began to back away. The dog seemed to keep shifting from oil-black to foggy gray. And it was getting bigger with each step it took. \n\nI ran. It was a surreal series of moments. There was still no sound at all, not my shoes slamming into the asphalt or the roar of my pulse that should have sounded like a waterfall. I sprinted down the silent road, too terrified to look back. Even though I couldn’t hear the thing’s footsteps, I knew it was getting closer. My legs and my lungs were burning, housing whipping past me. \n\nSound came crashing back all at once. R.E.M. whispered out of the headphones I had around my neck. A car alarm shrieked somewhere a few blocks over. I risked a look back and saw the dog was gone. Still, I only slowed a little, then turned and walked backward searching for the animal in the shadows along the street. Nothing. \n\nI snuck into my bedroom through the window, silently swearing to never get high again. I fell asleep with my headphones on and R.E.M. playing on low. The sleep wasn’t good, too full of dreams and twisting things. My parents woke me up early, which felt borderline sacrilegious on a Saturday. Before I could complain, I saw their faces. They had ugly news. Sofia was dead.\n\nDanny, Rache, and I all met in the park that afternoon. We all looked awful. Even Rache, who was always perfectly put together, had dark bags under her eyes and slight bedhead. I knew I was worse. Danny…Danny looked like he got hit by a truck. He was wearing sunglasses but I had a strong inclination that his eyes were bloodshot to hell. An unlit cigarette hung from his lips; he kept looking around the picnic table we were sitting at, coiled and tense. \n\n“Ripped apart,” Rache said, the first words any of us spoke since we agreed to meet up. “Torn apart by animals in the woods outside of her house. Jesus. How could that happen?” \n\nDanny finally flicked open his stolen Zippo and lit his cigarette. \n\n“We know how it happened. We called it up.” \n\n“You don’t believe that,” I said, not sure if I did or not. “You don’t think a demon killed Sofia.” \n\nDanny sucked on his filter for a while. “I don’t know, Billy boy. I sure as Hell don’t know. What I do know, though, is that something chased me last night. Something evil.” \n\nRache and I shared a look. She spoke first. \n\n“Me too. Some sort of…I don’t know, a mountain lion maybe.” \n\n“Here?” Danny asked, gesturing around the park. “Do you see any hills nearby?” \n\n“Layoff,” I said. “Something came after me, too. It was a dog.” \n\n“For me, it looked like a bear,” Danny said, tossing his dead cigarette onto the gravel trail nearby. “You know, a small bear but *nasty* looking. Like the damn thing had rabies or something.” \n\nThe three of us sat in silence for a minute. Then the silence reminded me of the night before and I resisted the urge to panic-sprint for my house. \n\n“When you saw the, uh, *animals*,” I began, “did it get-”\n\n“Quiet?” Rache finished. “That’s what you’re going to say, right?”\n\nDanny nodded. “Silence. It was like all of the noise in the world went down some drain and left only absolute silence.” He nodded to himself. “Alright, it was a demon then that came after us. A demon that got Sofia.” \n\nI shifted on the table. “I don’t think-”\n\nDanny held up one hand in a “*let me finish*” gesture.\n\n“Just, for the time being, let’s say it was something supernatural. The silence is how we know it’s about to attack. It seems like it comes after all of us that, well…all of us who are connected to it, at the same time.” \n\n“So why didn’t it kill all four of us?” Rache asked. I was surprised to feel her squeeze my hand. “Why stop after killing Sofia?” \n\nDanny stared down at the ground. “Maybe it only wants one of us at a time. Maybe…maybe it’s like a snake. It only needs to feed now and then.” \n\nRache sobbed and I gave Danny a dirty look but didn’t respond. He scanned the treeline then leaned over and knocked against the picnic table three times. \n\n“You all heard that, too, right?” he asked. We nodded. “Okay, okay good. The silence is how we’ll know it’s around. If all of the sound goes out–wherever you are, whatever you’re doing–you *run*.” \n\n“Run where?” I asked. \n\nDanny thought about it. “A church, I think. A temple, a monestary, hollowed ground, man, whatever is closest. You run and you bunker down and you wait. I bet it can only hunt at night.”\n\n“Why do you think that?” Rache asked. \n\n“It’s always that way. Demons hunt in the dark.”\n\n“Didn’t realize you were an expert on demonology,” I said, but I didn’t argue. \n\nDanny was the first to leave. “I’m going to do some research at the library. Just stay vigilant. If I’m right, the demon will attack again tonight.” \n\nI felt sick for the rest of the day, carefully watching the sun sink lower, with my Walkman turned up to max. As soon as the music stopped, I would run. There was a church two blocks over from my house. I told my parents I needed to take a walk to clear my head just so I could be close to the place at sunset. They were worried about me and made me promise not to be out late with the *animal* attacks going on and all. Come sundown, I was sitting on the steps in front of the church, headphones around my neck but with the music still blaring (Gin Blossoms this time). \n\nAfter an hour of sitting under the weak porch lights of the church, I got up and slowly started walking home. That was the worst part, the part I hadn’t thought about…the part when I was the most vulnerable. I moved at a fast clip, always ready to turn on my heels and sprint for hollowed ground if my music stopped. In the end, nothing happened that night other than my insomnia growing a little stronger. Nothing happened the night after that, either, or the week after, or for months, then years. My guard dropped. It was so easy to write it all off as a random attack and the three of us having bad dreams. \n\nThen, five years to the day of Sofia’s death, my music stopped playing. \n\nI was sitting on my deck watching the stars on the night of the second attack. After graduating, Rache, Danny, and I drifted apart. Rachel went to university, Danny did a stint in the military and got tossed out for drugs last I heard. I ended up going into business with my brother right after high school. Roofing, home renovation, and general contracting; I was making good money for a guy in his early twenties back then. \n\nThe night it came back, I remember I was drinking a beer and listening to *The Slim Shady LP*. I still carried my WalkMan everywhere, though I’d upgraded to the CD version by then. It was out of habit more than anything; I rarely thought about Sofia except for the occasional nightmare. But as soon as the music went dead right at the first chorus of *Role Model*, I was standing and looking around my yard. I’d just bought the house in the spring and loved the backyard. It was fenced in and brightly lit by big floodlights on the house. \n\n*Hello?* I tried to call out. \n\nThe silence was back and it was everything. \n\nShadows moved at one corner of the fence. A *lot* of shadows. Tiny, darting things, black specks against the fence. I felt a humming in my teeth even though I couldn’t hear it. I ran for my house. The creatures hit the glass door like hail only a few seconds after I closed it. \n\n*Taptaptaptaptap.*\n\nThe things were like a cross between a wasp and a bat. They had smooth, bullet-bodies with segmented eyes and tattered wings. Just like the dog from years ago, the bugs shifted depending how I looked at them. Sometimes they were black, other times brown, and occasionally a dark red. I backed away as they slammed into the glass over and over again. Cracks formed, then spiderwebbed across the door. I was sprinting down the hallway trying to decide which room to lock myself inside when I heard the glass shatter. It took another two steps for that to register. \n\nI **heard** it shatter. The silence was gone. I still slipped into the bathroom and barricaded the door, shoving a towel under the seam to block it completely. After ten minutes with no signs of the creatures, I went to check the damage. The door leading to my deck had been turned into a pile of glass shards on my dining room floor. I stared at it until the ringing of my phone snapped me out of it. \n\n“Hello?” I whispered, looking out into my yard.\n\n“Oh thank God,” a familiar voice said on the line, “you’re okay. Billy, you’re okay, right?” \n\n“Yeah. I think so. Who is this?” \n\n“It’s Rachel.” \n\n“Rache?”\n\n“Yeah. It’s back, Billy. Did you-”\n\n“Yes,” I said, moving some glass away with my foot. “It was just here.” \n\nThere was a pause. “I called you first,” Rache said. “Danny…”\n\nMy chest ached. “I’ll call him and then I’ll call you right back, okay?”\n\n“Okay. Call as soon as you can.” \n\nI promised I would and then went searching through my contact book for a phone number for Danny. The first one I tried was disconnected; the second rang for several minutes before I hung up. I called Danny’s parents and confirmed that the second number was correct and that he should be home. I tried the number every ten minutes for the next hour with the same result. By the time I called Rache back she knew–just like I did–that we would be going to our hometown for a funeral very soon.\n\nThey said that Danny overdosed and most people believed that but they never did tell us exactly *what* he overdosed on. His funeral was closed-casket.  I kept picturing hundreds of those wasp things, each the size of a Swiss Army Knife, swarming over my friend, biting and stinging and ripping, filling his veins with venom. They found his body in a cemetery not far from his house. I heard later from a cop friend that it looked like he’d been crawling toward the church when he died. He didn’t even know if that would work but I guess that was his second best hope...other than the demon getting one of us first. \n\nFive years between attacks; five years between the bonfire and the ritual we all thought was just silly, spooky crap and two funerals. \n\nRachel and I agreed to stay close for a while to keep an eye on each other. We never really talked about exactly what we would do if the demon showed up again other than making a B-line for the nearest patch of holy ground. Rache wasn’t long out of school and ended up getting a job in our hometown, just temporary. Temporary turned into a year, then five, and still there was no sign of the demon. Part of me (a huge part) tried to convince myself that it was over. Two was enough, I hoped. Whatever attention we drew, whatever we summoned, two was enough and now it was gone. \n\nI never really believed that but what was my other option? Accepting that the next time it showed up, either I’d be dead or my wife would? \n\nHow Rache and I ended up together despite our best efforts still baffles me. Strategy sessions turned into coffee meetings then into sushi dates then movies, some trips and a wedding, which was the second-best day of my life. Then Rhea was born and I worried that the seams of me would split with all of that happiness. \n\nFifteen beautiful, perfect years; that’s what Rachel and I got before the third visit from the demon. \n\nI was driving when it happened. Music was on again–it was almost always on in my life–but this time it was coming from my phone and the car’s Bluetooth connection. Nirvana, I think, though I can’t remember if it was *Nevermind* or *In Utero*. When the silence came, I screamed but a calmness soon settled over me. There was a car gaining on me in my rear view. It was black, then gray, then red depending on the light and the angle. My first instinct was to slam on the accelerator, to night race the demon until sunrise if need be. But I didn’t. Instead, I took my foot off of the gas. \n\nThe shadow car behind me got closer. I couldn’t see much through its high beams but there was a human shape in the front at the wheel. Then, after I blinked, there were human shadows in *my* car, filling up my backseat, featureless, silent, reaching. I closed my eyes and hit the brakes. One night. Five years. Fifteen years. If the pattern held, then maybe Rache would have another twenty-five years with Rhea. Or maybe forty-five. Maybe a lifetime. \n\nThe car stopped and I waited. I wondered if it would hurt. I tried to keep Rachel’s face and Rhea’s face fixed in my mind. At least they would be safe. \n\n*But he knows not what it means*\n\n*Knows not what it means*\n\n*And I say he's the one*\n\n*Who likes all our pretty songs*\n\n*And he likes to sing along*\n\nI heard Nirvana coming from my speakers and, at first, I didn’t understand. Then it dawned on me, slow and terrible, that I was still alive and unhurt. The silence was gone. The demon didn’t get me. \n\nIt turned out Rache made the same choice I did, only she was better at it. She was always a step ahead of me even when we were young. We buried her on a beautiful, cloudy day last week. Rhea hasn’t stopped crying yet. Neither have I, though I try to do it when I’m alone. I know, eventually, Rhea’s eyes will clear and I’ll do everything I can to give her a lovely life, one where she hears stories about her mother every day.\n\nTwenty-five years. Maybe more but probably not. Each day is a gift Rachel gave me as well as a demand. Take care of our daughter. Make her know she is loved. And when the silence comes again, be ready. \n\nSee you then, Rache.",

        "text": "  \n\n*My shrieks of agony reached a pitch and volume I didn’t know I was capable of as the enormous demonic-looking creature sank its huge razor-sharp teeth into my shoulder tearing through muscle and sinew. I refused to release my grip on the truck’s door handle, so the monster chewed through my shoulder and ripped my body away from it. As it dragged me into the woods, kicking and screaming, blood pouring from my shoulder, I looked back at my arm still hanging on to the door in desperation.* \n\n*Once it had dragged me so far into the woods that I could no longer see the lights of the truck, it released me. I tried to run, but the loss of blood weakened me. I got halfway to my feet before stumbling back to the ground. I tried again and again, but gravity kept yanking me back down. I didn’t have the energy to make a run for it. Every time I tried, more blood poured out of my mangled shoulder.* \n\n*It watched me struggle with that nightmare mouth formed into a smile. It was enjoying this. It was toying with me. My breaths came in ragged gasps as my body grew dangerously low on blood. I knew I was barely clinging to life.* \n\n*My will to live was gone. I had no fight left in me. Desperation had set in but there was nothing left to act on. All I could do was lay there and wait for the inevitable.*\n\n*I guess I was no longer amusing if I wasn’t trying to escape. It stepped over and picked me up by the neck. Pain screamed at me to do something, but there wasn’t anything I could do. It grasped the top of my head and turned it sideways, pulling my face into its maw of blood-stained teeth.* \n\n*I could smell the horrid stench of death and decay as it closed its mouth on my face.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke and sat straight up in bed gulping massive breaths of air. I felt like I was drowning in total darkness. My head swiveled around so quickly that I nearly gave myself whiplash as I searched for anything to show where I was. Eventually, my hand landed on my bedstand. I felt the hard wood and recognized it. My hand crept silently along until it discovered my cell phone. I turned the light on and shone it around.\n\nMy wife lay in bed beside me sleeping peacefully. If I wanted to keep it that way, I would be quiet and stop shining the light on her. \n\nMy sweaty palms and brow were the only remaining evidence of the nightmare I had woken from. My side of the bed was wet, but I told myself that it was sweat. My breathing slowly returned to normal as my mind told me it was a dream. I reached up and touched my face to make sure it was still there. Once that was confirmed, I reached for my shoulder and found it still attached to the rest of me.\n\nI got up and went to the bathroom, then splashed some cold water on my face before checking the time. It was four-thirty in the morning. Only an hour before my normal time to get up. I debated staying awake, but in the end, decided a little more sleep would do me good. After all, it was just a dream.\n\nMy morning was like every other weekday morning. I got up, showered, and had some breakfast. Just as I was getting ready to head out the door, my eight-year-old daughter Angeline came downstairs to get ready for school. She insisted I give her a hug every morning before I left for work and promise to be safe.\n\nThe morning run was nothing out of the ordinary. The same headaches as every day delivering car parts to garages. I joked with one of the managers that my week went Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Friday. He laughed and agreed that sometimes it felt like his weeks went the same way.\n\nIn the afternoon, it was my turn to do the late run. Twice a week I had to drive the big box truck down to the main warehouse in the afternoon to pick up the parts for the following morning’s run. I didn’t really like the late run, especially in winter when it started getting dark early. I usually got home around eight, which was Angeline’s bedtime. I would get home just in time to tuck her in and kiss her goodnight. If I ran late, she wouldn’t go to sleep until I tucked her in.\n\nThat afternoon wasn’t much different than any other, with one exception. I couldn’t get the nagging feeling of déjà vu out of my head. I knew I had done this run countless times before, but this time seemed different. Like there was a growing expectation that something was about to happen. \n\nTraffic didn’t seem any worse than any other time, although I knew that there was always a danger when dealing with drivers. Accidents happened fast, and you couldn’t always avoid them. I kept a wary eye on the other cars and trucks around me. But still, there was a growing dread in my mind. It increased with every mile I drove. \n\nFinally, it hit me. My nightmare. It had been on this road, and I was coming up on the area where it happened. \n\nI tried to laugh it off and tell my brain that it was just a coincidence. That I traveled this road twice a week for years. Of course, I was going to dream about it sometime.\n\nTrying to laugh it off or deny it was having the opposite effect. I was only a few miles away from the spot and my heart was racing. I tried turning on the radio to calm my nerves, but the song playing was Metallica’s ‘All nightmare long’. That wasn’t helping.\n\nI was only a mile away now. I remembered seeing a specific bridge in my nightmare and I knew it was coming up. My fingers white-knuckled the steering wheel. My eyes darted back and forth looking for anything out of the ordinary.\n\n‘Out of the ordinary?’ I chuckled. ‘Like a demonic beast chewing my arm off and dragging me into the woods to devour me?’\n\nI had just reached the bridge when my phone rang, nearly giving me a heart attack.\n\nOnce the ice had melted out of my veins, I turned it on speaker so I wouldn’t get pulled over.\n\n“Hello?” I said.\n\n“Daddy?” Angeline said.\n\n“What’s up, sweetie?”\n\n“Where are you?”\n\n“I’m on my way down to the warehouse.”\n\n“When will you be home?”\n\n“Probably around 8,” I said.\n\n“Can’t you come home now?” she said with quiet desperation.\n\n“Why? Is something wrong?” I said suddenly feeling very nervous.\n\nShe paused for a long moment.\n\n“Are you and mommy ok?” I said.\n\n“Oh no, we’re fine,” she said.\n\n“Then what’s the problem?”\n\n“Oh, nothing,” she said. “I just wanted you home.”\n\n“Ok, well I’ll be home around 8. Love you.”\n\n“I love you too, daddy.”\n\nShe hung up the phone as I smiled and shook my head. \n\n‘I’d love to be home earlier,’ I thought.\n\nThe road stretched out in front of me suddenly felt different. I couldn’t put my finger on it but something had changed. I drove the rest of the way to the warehouse trying to figure out what. It wasn’t until I had loaded and was halfway home that I realized, I had missed seeing the spot where my nightmare happened because I was talking to Angeline.\n\nI chuckled to myself thinking how worked up I had gotten over a silly dream.\n\nI pulled into the driveway a few minutes before 8 and went straight to Angeline’s room to tuck her in.\n\n“Daddy!” she said jumping up into my arms.\n\n“Whoa, someone’s glad to see me,” I said hugging her, then laying her back in bed.\n\n“You made it,” she said.\n\n“Don’t I always?”\n\n“Did you see him?” she said.\n\n“See who?”\n\n“Oh… umm, no one,” she said. “I love you, daddy.”\n\n“I love you too, sweetheart,” I said. “Goodnight.”\n\nI closed her door feeling more than a little confused.\n\nI walked into the kitchen where my nose and eyes were equally treated to the smell of the delicious food my wife was getting out of the microwave. \n\n“What was going on with her today?” I said as I sat down at the table.\n\n“What do you mean?” she said. “The phone call?”\n\nI nodded my fork halfway to my mouth.\n\n“She came home from school and said she needed to talk to you right away.”\n\n“She didn’t say why?” I said between bites.  \n\n“Nope, just that it was important.”\n\n“Weird.”\n\n“She’s eight,” she said smiling. “She probably just missed her daddy.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said sighing. “I get that, but she makes me feel so guilty for getting home late. I wish she understood that’s just how life goes sometimes.”\n\n“She’ll get there,” she said reaching across the table and taking my hand.\n\nI smiled and enjoyed the rest of my meal as we talked about our days and then went to bed.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next morning, Angeline acted as if nothing had happened. She got up, got ready for school, kissed us goodbye, and got on the bus.\n\nMy day was frustrating, tedious, and long, just like usual. I didn’t have the late run and didn’t get any phone calls from home.\n\nThe day after that, however, was another matter. She got out of bed and immediately asked if I had the late run.\n\n“Yes, sweetie.”\n\n“Do you have to do it?”\n\n“Yes, sweetie.”\n\n“Can’t someone else?”\n\n“No, sweetie.”\n\n“Please, please, be safe.”\n\n“I will, sweetie.”\n\nShe was very distracted at breakfast and nearly missed the bus. She kept staring at me. I wanted to ask her what was wrong, but I was half afraid of the answer.\n\nMy morning run that day was easy and I was able to get started on the afternoon run a little early. \n\n‘I’d love to surprise the family by arriving home early,’ I thought, smiling. \n\nMy smile evaporated as I approached the bridge. All the terror of the nightmare came rushing back, along with Angeline’s cryptic comment about seeing someone.\n\nI slowed down a little and once again my eyes were on swivels. I searched the trees along the side of the road as they rapidly passed by. \n\nI was about to shake off my feelings as stupid when my eyes locked on something and my blood froze. In the trees, I saw a set of eyes. My mind tried to write it off as a deer but there were a few problems with that. The deer would’ve had to be seven feet tall, or standing on its hind legs on the second rung of a ladder. Since I didn’t believe either of those things was probable, I had to go with the last option. There was a giant creature standing in the trees, staring at me.\n\nAll of this processed through my mind in a flash as I drove past. I saw it step out of the trees just before I passed it and bend down as if ready to spring out in front of me. But there was a car right behind me, so it dove back into the cover of the trees.\n\nI shook myself mentally as though waking from a dream. \n\n‘That couldn’t have been real,’ I told myself, wishing I believed it.\n\nThe rest of my trip down, including loading the truck seemed like some surreal vision. It was like I was floating through a daydream.\n\nThe trip back made me nervous as I approached the bridge, but I realized I was on the other side of a divided highway. There was a lot of open area between the lanes going north and the lanes going south.\n\nRegardless, I kept my eyes trained on the other side of the highway when I came near the bridge. I didn’t know if it was my imagination or if I had really seen eyes watching me from the other side. I didn’t wait around to find out. \n\nThat night when I got home, Angeline met me at the door and nearly knocked me over in a tight hug. \n\n“You made it!” she said squeezing me so tight I could barely breathe.\n\nI carried her inside and put her to bed. \n\n“Ok, Angeline, what’s going on?” I said.\n\n“You’re home safe,” she said. “That’s all that’s important.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I said. “Has someone been telling you I’m in danger?”\n\nShe lowered her eyes. “Yes.”\n\n“Who?”\n\nShe looked up and locked eyes with me.\n\n“You saw him tonight.”\n\nI stood and backed away without realizing I had.\n\n“What do you mean?” I said. “Saw who?”\n\n“You know. He watched you. He tried to get you but he couldn’t because of the other car.”\n\nI dropped to my knees beside her bed.\n\n“How did you know that?” I whispered.\n\nShe reached down and touched my cheek.\n\n“I saw it in my dream.”\n\nI sat there silent, in shock for a long time.\n\n“Daddy?” Angeline said. \n\nI looked at her.\n\n“Can you turn off the light now, I’d like to go to sleep.”\n\nAutomatically, I stood, kissed her forehead, and stepped out of the room turning off the light as I went.\n\nI went out and collapsed into a kitchen chair.\n\n“What’s wrong?” My wife said. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”\n\nMy eyes locked on hers. For a long moment, I didn’t understand what she had said.\n\n“Are you ok?” she said sitting beside me and putting her hand gently on my shoulder.\n\nFinally, I roused myself out of my stupor.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I said. “I’m fine, just Angeline being concerned about me again. Where do you think that’s coming from?”\n\n“I don’t know, but she really is worried about you,” she said. “When she got home she said she was tired and wanted to take a nap. A short time after she laid down I could hear her yelling in her room. I ran to her and she was asleep, but screaming, “No, he’s my daddy and you can’t have him!”\n\nI tried not to turn white as a sheet. Instead, I chuckled. \n\n“Kids, where do they come up with this stuff?” I said with a smile.\n\n“She loves you,” she said. “You’re her daddy and she doesn’t want to see anything happen to you so she gets herself all worked up.”\n\n“You’re right,” I said smiling. \n\nI kissed her, then ate my supper. After I was done eating we went to bed and kissed her some more.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next day once again was like nothing happened. It wasn’t until the following Tuesday, the day I would have to take the evening run, that Angeline was beside herself in the morning.\n\n“Please don’t go today,” she begged me.\n\n“I have to go to work,” I said.\n\n“You can’t.”\n\nI saw the desperation in her eyes. It frightened me beyond anything. I fought to hide my fear.\n\n“Ok, honey,” I said. “I haven’t called off in a while. I’ll take today off.”\n\nI saw the weight lift from her eyes as she yelled, “Yay!”\n\nThen she hugged me tightly and ran out the door to catch the bus.\n\n“Are you really taking the day off?” my wife said.\n\n“Are you complaining?” I said.\n\n“Not in the least,” she said. “How about a movie?”\n\n“Sounds good. I don’t remember the last time we watched a movie together.”\n\nOf course, my boss wasn’t happy. He told me that if I was faking I’d better update my resume.\n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\nThat was one of the best days I’d had in a long time. The next few days were awesome as well. It wasn’t until the following Tuesday that the wheels came off.\n\n“You can’t go,” Angeline squealed as I headed for the door.\n\n“I have to, honey,” I said trying to calm her. “If I don’t, they’ll fire me.”\n\n“Daddy, please, don’t go,” she said grabbing my leg and holding on for dear life.\n\n“I’m sorry, I took the other day off. If I don’t work, we don’t eat.”\n\nI pulled her off my leg and handed her to my wife as I started out the door.\n\n“Calm down, sweetie,” she said holding her tightly as she struggled to get to me.\n\n“You don’t understand, he’s waiting for you.”\n\nI stopped and turned back to her. \n\n“Who’s waiting?” my wife said.\n\nI stared into Angeline’s hopeful eyes.\n\n“No one,” I said. “I have no idea what she’s talking about. Must be her imagination going off the rails again.”\n\nHer eyes met mine and betrayal leaked out and down her cheeks. I turned away to keep my heart from breaking.\n\n“Daddy!” she screamed. \n\nI got in my car and drove away, drying my eyes on my sleeve.\n\nI tried all morning to get Angeline’s look of hurt and betrayal out of my mind. It wasn’t until I was halfway down to the warehouse in the afternoon that her words really sank in. \n\n‘He’s waiting for you.’\n\nMy veins turned to ice. \n\nI was hurtling toward my doom as I got closer to the bridge. \n\nDid I really believe there was a monster waiting for me? Or was this pure coincidence force-feeding me my daughter’s paranoia? \n\nMy truck was devouring miles faster than I wanted, forcing me into a decision. Should I pull over? If this thing is waiting for me, would it even matter?\n\nI couldn’t live the rest of my life hiding from fears that weren’t even mine. I kept moving, the bridge nearly in sight. \n\nI tensed up as I passed under the bridge and passed the spot I had dreamed about.\n\nI sighed, chuckling at my own foolishness.\n\nI was still chuckling when the thing from my nightmare stepped out on the road in front of my truck.\n\nDisbelief and terror flooded my eyes as this apparition stood in my way, daring me to hit it. \n\nI stood on the brakes and tried to swerve, but it was no use. My truck smashed into the massive monster and came to a screeching halt as it slid sideways on the gravel on the berm and off the side of the road.\n\nI sat there, blinded by the airbag, waiting for it to collapse as I peeled my fingers off the steering wheel and unbuckled my seat belt.\n\nI slowly opened the door and stepped out of the truck. The darkness was punctuated by the headlights of passing cars. I stepped around to the front still in a daze and looked at the destroyed passenger side of the truck. As I marveled at the destruction, I remembered what I had hit. I turned to get back in my truck but my way was blocked but the huge demon-looking creature staring down at me.  \n\nMy nightmare came rushing back to me with stunning vividness as the front of my pants suddenly became wet and a yellow river ran down the inside of my pants. \n\n*Standing very close to this exact spot, my arm grasping the door handle as the creature’s teeth tore through my shoulder, leaving a bloody arm still hanging onto the door handle as it dragged me off to the woods to devour me.*\n\nI stood there remembering my nightmare as if it had already happened and realized it was about to happen. \n\nThe creature took a step towards me and I took a step back around the corner of the truck. The only plan my petrified mind could conjure was to keep the truck between me and the creature.  If it took one step at a time, we could do slow laps around the truck all night. But I knew it wouldn’t be patient much longer. It wore a feral grin composed of those horribly long, razor-sharp, blood-stained teeth, which told me it was about to strike.\n\nThe truck sat sideways, shielding us from the lights of the cars as they rushed past us, oblivious of the life-and-death struggle playing out. At first, I held out hope that someone would pull over to check on me or that a police officer would see my truck and stop to find out what had happened. \n\nI saw the creature tensing up to spring at me and realized I didn’t have time to wait for any law enforcement or good Samaritans. In fact, I had no time at all. I gripped the door handle and waited for death.\n\nI wished I had listened to Angeline and not gone to work. I wished I was home with my wife and daughter. I wished I didn’t know that a creature like this existed. \n\nThere was only one thing left to do.\n\nI closed my eyes and mentally said goodbye to my loved ones.\n\nJust as it was about to launch itself at me, I pushed off from the door handle and ran straight into traffic.\n\nThe last thing I remember was a horn honking and then pain before the darkness took me.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke to a white room and machines beeping. Most of my body was wrapped in a cast and there were ropes hanging from a metal frame that held my arms and legs up.\n\nI was in and out of consciousness but caught snatches of conversations.\n\n“Multiple bones broken… “\n\n“Hip replaced… “\n\n“Lucky to be alive… “\n\nEventually, a policeman did come to talk to me. I told him I had hit a deer and lost control of the truck. I said I had become disoriented by the airbag hitting me in the face and that’s why I stumbled into traffic.\n\nHe told me that the first car to hit me bounced me up in the air and then I rolled off the roof of the next two cars before landing on the road. He said I was lucky that the cars had managed to stop when they did, or the next car was about to run over my head.\n\nI told him I felt lucky to be alive.\n\nThe next day my wife and daughter came to visit.\n\nAngeline was so happy to see me that she grabbed me in a big hug, sending pain shooting through me. My wife pulled her off of me and explained how much I was hurting.\n\nI asked my wife if she would get the nurse to bring me some pain meds. Once she was out of the room, Angeline lowered her voice and asked the question I knew she was dying to ask.\n\n“Did you see him?”\n\nI closed my eyes and struggled with what to tell her. Do I let her continue to believe in this creature or do I lie to put her mind at ease?\n\nI looked into those expectant eyes and told her what I thought was best. \n\n“No, honey, I just had a little accident that’s all.”\n\nHer look fell from anticipation to disappointment.\n\n“I understand,” was all she said before my wife came back in the room followed by the nurse.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSix months later I’m walking again. The doctors say I might be able to drive again soon. My wife got a job that pays the bills and puts food on the table. I’m looking forward to working again and helping out.\n\nI’ll never drive a truck again. I’ll never drive on that stretch of road again.\n\nI find myself questioning if it was real or not. Was there really a demonic creature bent on dining on my entrails, or did I just hit a deer and stumble into traffic?\n\nI don’t know. My mind seems to be trying to protect me the same way I was protecting Angeline. \n\nAngeline hasn’t had any nightmares recently and neither have I. Honestly, I hope I never have another dream. It isn’t worth the risk of seeing that thing ever again.",
