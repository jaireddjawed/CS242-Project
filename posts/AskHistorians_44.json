I read the rules and I hope I didn't forget anything.\n\nI have been doing soft research on Sameera Moussa's death, an egyptian female atom scientist.\n\nI couldn't really find any information about her death other than one line every page;\n\n&gt;On August 5th, 1952 after her first visit to America she intended to return home, but was invited on another trip. On the way, the car rushed down from a height of 40 feet, which killed her immediately. The mystery surrounding her accident, since the invitation to California, made people suspicious and many believe that it was a planned assassination.\n\nNow I am not one to believe in conspiracy theories or anything like that, but I also read;\n\n&gt;This invitation later turned out to be a fake and her driver was discovered to have been using a false identity. On the way to her supposed destination, her car plummeted from a height of 40 feet and she died almost immediately; the corpse of driver was missing as he presumably jumped from the car before impact.\n\nThis was on a less reliable website that seemed to be biased towards middle eastern values (I am middle eastern myself, I don't want to sound racist or anything).\n\nHowever, I am still unsure if that is correct or not.\n\nI would appreciate it if someone who knows about her history or something similar can shed some light on this.\n\nThanks, in advance!",

I know this is a flimsy source but the United States Wikipedia page says early on that the cultures that were created from the Paleoamerican Culture that came from Siberia, “had almost completely declined when Europeans arrived in North America and began colonizing it.” Were Native societies across both continents in a decline shortly before the Europeans arrived or am I simply misreading this and it says that it only declined after the arrival of Euros? If it is the prior, what caused this hemispherical decline of American empires and societies? Would they have been able to stand up to the Euro colonization if not for this potential decline?",

Like, I can wrap my head around rapid migration due to famine, conquest, etc… but the *gradual* Han displacement of Tai-Kradai peoples seems a little tougher to understand. Did it look similar to the western expansion of the United States - like, groups of Han settlers simply show up and take all the best agricultural land by force? Or was there something else going on?\n\nIn other words, why did the Han *succeed* in displacing the Tai?",

And I was wondering how much of a role the weather played in determining whether a society was uptight or not?  \n\nLike how much was the Protestant reformation and other social factors involved in making “anglo-Saxon” types more puritanical about nudity and sexuality, and how much was it just a factor of the weather?  Lot easier to demand everyone wear a ton of layers and fully cover their body when you live somewhere like London.  Lot harder to rationally enforce clothing norms in places that like average 80+ degrees for the year.   So how much was the difference in Protestant v Catholic acceptance of public lewdness and Northern v southern art mostly just societies building their norms around the weather?  \n\nAnd then does the history of Middle Eastern clothing requirements totally ruin this theory?",

        "text": "So as far as I can tell, in the ancient world, monarchy was basically, this one guy owns this state. He has final say in all laws, he can conquer or purchase more territory with state resources and that territory becomes part of his state. If he decides his territory is too big he can designate other guys to govern parts of the state, but he could overrule them if he wanted. The governors might have a lot of resources so he might be scared to meddle with their lands too much for fear they would rebel, but legally he's their boss.\n\nIn medieval Europe though, things seem to change. For example the Holy Roman Emperor ruled the HRE, but apparently only owned Austria and Hungary, but Hungary wasn't a part of the HRE, and Austria was, but many other states also belonged to it, but the emperor didn't own them? But then he also owned Spain, but it was still it's own country? And marrying your daughter away meant your nation could fall into foreign hands, but people did it anyway? Maps of the late middle ages even label \"Habsburg Possessions\" and then individual HRE member states, instead of labeling the HRE and the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nI'm trying to gain an understanding of how large scale politics shifted from ancient monarchs who seemed to be synonymous with the state they ruled, to medieval families who acted more like a state than the states their individual members ruled. But I can't find any resources on this.",

I think medieval ages had some heavy religious indoctrinating to make people fight for a false cause in name of religion. (religion is an example here as a used tool for indoctrinating) was there any form of fighting without violence against people who were heavily indoctrinated? \n\n2- how did people through history fought against a regime with total control over local news (media) and being a cold blooded killer? like I know soviets oppresed people heavily and it worked for them. Stalin was never overthrown. his great purges worked. even Soviet dissolve was not a revolution, IIRC, it was the last leader who wanted to give people more freedom and happiness which lead to dissolve of soviet and puppet states. when I see how a brutal totalitarians regime with strong intel system like Soviet, actually worked and didn't fall by will of people, I kind of wonder how people living in the same system could have any hope of revolution or change. so is there any example through history where people actually manage to overthrow such a regime with no outside help?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I'm aware that they gave some legitimacy to the bakufu regime and were therefore kept somewhat afloat but I don't know where they drew their power from. AFAIK they did not hold land and didn't have a han to administer to draw taxes from. The emperor didn't reign for centuries and the court sometimes even had to starve. \n\nAnd the book mentioned the court exerting pressure on the bakufu and trying to force it into subordination without any explanation as to 1) how it worked, and 2) why the court thought it'd work. \n\nThe only thing I'm aware of is, that after Hotta Masayoshi's predecessor Abe Masahiro's death, who was far more adept at political maneuvering, Hotta had to take over as  *Rōjū* *shuseki* \\- chief councilor. He then was hard-pressed when Townsend Harris arrived and demanded privileges of travel and residence, which was sharply opposed, but he acquiesced in 1857. In 1858 he tried and failed, to secure court approval of the treaty (why did he want court approval?), which supposedly was the reignition of the court's political activity and led to the loss of faith in him.  \n\nWhy did he try to get court approval? - Were children thought to respect the court or something?

        "text": "I have recently been studying the history of the Achaemenid (Persian) Empire. One of the things that surprised and saddened me was how so much of our sources mainly come from the ancient Greeks and not from the Persians themselves. I have therefore trier to find unique archaeological evidence from the Persian side and happened to come across this unique surviving inscription created by the Persians and this inscription is known as the ‘Daiva Iscription’. \n\nIt is a royal inscription related to ancient Persian religion and features Xerxes in which the Great King outlaws the worship of detested beings whom he calls “daiva's” and relates the destruction of their sanctuaries. I believe the Old Persian text is known from three slabs of stone from Persepolis and the citadel of Pasargadae.\n\nHere it is below (along with the source I am using):\n\nSource — XPh: ‘Daiva’ Inscription, §§4b-d (tr. Kuhrt, *PE* 11.88): \n\n———\n\n“And among those countries there were (some) where formerly the daivas had been worshipped. Afterwards by the favour of Auramazda I destroyed that place of the *daivas*, and I gave orders: ‘The daivas shall not be worshipped any longer!’ Wherever formerly the *daivas* have been worshipped, there I worshipped Auramazda at the proper time and with the proper ceremony. And there was something else, that had been done wrong, that too I put right. That which I have done, all that I have done by the favour of Auramazda. Auramazda brought me aid, until I had done the work. You, who shall be hereafter, if you shall think: 'Happy may I be (while) living and (when) dead may I be blessed', obey that law, which Auramazda has established! Worship Auramazda at the proper time and with the proper ritual! The man who obeys that law which Auramazda has established, and (who) worships Auramazda at the proper time and in the proper ceremonial style, he both becomes happy (while) living and blessed (when) dead.”\n\n———\n\nI find this passage extremely fascinating for numerous reasons. One reason I find it interesting is the word ‘Daiva’ appears to clearly mean ‘demon’. It also looks similar to the word ‘daeva’ in the Avesta (the holy book of Zoroastrianism). \nAnother reason I find it interesting is because I cannot tell whether the statement is an ideological one and daivas were gods that were to be rejected, or whether the statement was politically motivated and daivas were gods that were followed by (potential) enemies of the state. I personally find the official religion of Zoroastrianism of the ancient Persian Empire to be one of the most fascinating areas of study when discussing this part of ancient history and one of the ideas I always believed about it is that the Persian Empire was overall very tolerant of other religions within its borders (such as Cyrus the Great freeing the Jews and helping them build the Second Temple). This inscription has for the first time made me question whether the Persian Empire was really tolerant of other religions. \n\nAfter all of this, I was therefore wondering what is the significance of this inscription and also what is the context for this unique archaeological translation? Thank you.",
