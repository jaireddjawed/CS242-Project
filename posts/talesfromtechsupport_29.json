        "text": "I was reminded of this from an AskReddit about work place meltdowns and thought I would share it here, in TFTS fashion. I've also expanded on it a bit since I seem to have some time on my hands. It's also all flooding back to me the more I think about it. It is long, so for those of you who have responsibilities to handle, skip to the end for the TL;DR. \n\nFor those of you that are having a nice, quiet (although boringly slow) Good Friday, I give you the Tale of the Always Angry PR Lady.\n\n**The players involved**\n\n**LK** - Me, the poor, innocent bystander.\n\n**DSTech** - The Desk side tech that originally had the ticket. He’s in a different department and has a manager\n\n**PR** - The evil woman that the devil himself probably hid from. Top person to avoid at all costs unless you were just looking to be kicked\n\n**Lead** - My lead\n\n**Director** - My director and acting manager\n\n**The setting**\n\n*Previous job, many years ago. Working a hybrid call center-desk side gig. Still the FNG. When the actual deskside techs would go home, that’s when I started to be the Call Center/Deskside hybrid guy. As usual, our calls are recorded for training purposes, where `training purposes` means `evidence to get someone fired.` We supported internal employees only for a company that had many offices worldwide. We all worked in the HQ building and supported everyone from the janitor to the CEO. There was roughly 10,000 total with all the other buildings/campuses within the city itself. Also, we had no actual manager for our department at the time, so our director took that role.*\n\n*We had this list of people that we would always secretly hand out to the new people when they finished their 2 week training. Our leads and director knew the list existed, and knew it for the joke that it was. The list was the Top 10 people that you were to ignore calls from if you were having a bad day. The call would roll to the next tech, so it was cool. Someone would handle it. Of course, we never officially did this. ;)*\n\n*Our number 1 person to avoid at all costs on a bad day, happened to work in the PR department. She also had a Blackberry with, and I am not kidding, over 65,000 contacts! BB's are notorious for taking forever to back up and restore on a good day. Never mind a good day with the entire population of Daytona Beach, FL. I’m willing to bet she still does and this was a decade ago. It probably has the population of NYC programmed into by now though.*\n\n**And so it begins**\n\nFrom here until I come in, all of this info was in the notes/emails of the ticket or relayed to me by **DSTech.** On the day in question, **PR** has gotten another new BB. She is also getting ready to go on a business trip. \n\n**PR** was told at 8am by **DSTech** that if she wanted to take her new BB with her on her business trip that she needed to get her current BB to him before 10am. **PR** finally calls **DSTech** and gets her BB to him at 1pm and asks if it will be ready by 4pm. **DSTech** tells her that it is highly doubtful and that she should just take her current, working BB. She puts up a fuss about it, gets **DSTech’s** manager involved. **DSTech** is told to just get it done however he can. As always, it fails the first couple of times on backing up her massive amounts of data, and then continues to fail when loading it to the new one. **PR** calls **DSTech** at 4pm asking where her new BB is. He explains the issues and tells her that not only is the new one not ready, but the old one is currently in the middle of a 3 hour back up. If he stops it, there is a chance she could lose all her data. This is a problem b/c she *never backs up her phone to her laptop b/c it is not her job to make sure data is backed up. That's ITs job, not hers.* Her words.\n\n**PR** is pissed and the melt down is brewing nicely now. **PR** sends a number of emails to **DSTech** about how terrible he is. She’s also told him that her flight leaves at 5pm and now she's going to miss it b/c she cannot go without her BB.\n\nHere's where I come in. By this point in the day, I am the only one physically in the office. My lead is working from home, so he's technically there. \n\n**DSTech** comes to me at 5pm (his shift was 6a-3p) telling me what's going on, gives me the ticket number and says that when her phone is done with the backup, failed or not, take it to her if she is even still in the building. At least that way she will have the BB. The old BB finishes at 5:30 and I start calling **PR**. She never answers so I leave a VM. Call again at 6, 6:15 and 6:30. Left VMs each time, updated notes in ticket each time. I leave at 7 and I'm not planning on waiting around on her wrath. If 7 gets here and I haven’t heard from **PR**, then oh well.\n\nAt 6:45, she calls me directly, and she is 10 different kinds of pissed off. She's mad b/c original tech went home and won’t answer her calls or emails, she pissed b/c I told her that the only phone that was done was her old BB. She pissed b/c she has left the building (lies, she was there, b/c caller ID....) and couldn't get her phone. She’s pissed b/c her flight left an hour ago and she's stranded at the airport (more lies). She goes on and on ranting and raving about how we didn’t come get her phone until 1pm, we didn't do what she asked, we never get anything right, someone will be driving to the airport to deliver her phone to her, etc. Typical \"it's always the IT guy's fault\" kind of stuff.\n\nShe hangs up on me before I could even say a word. **PR** calls back 5 minutes later saying that she is now in the building (damn, that was a quick 15 mile drive) and is coming to get her phone. Hangs up on me again. She then calls from her desk phone again 10 minute later b/c she can't get through the doors on our floor after leaving the elevator lobby (and people like her is why it's locked down). I told her I would be happy to bring it down to her, or meet her in the lobby. We met in the lobby of her floor, she yanked the phone out of my hand and stormed off to her office.\n\nAs I am getting back to my desk to pack up and leave, she calls me again. It's after 7pm now and I am supposed to be off, but figure, WTH. Might was well see what crap she has to say now. She gives it to me for 10 minutes straight. Tells me how this is all my fault that she missed her flight, how I locked her out of her BB causing her to get the password wrong 10 times and getting her BB wiped (when asked what she wanted it set to on her new BB, she wrote in an email ab1234. The password for her old BB was AB1234 and was unchanged) In the time it took me to get on the elevator go up 1 floor and walk to my desk, she had managed to wipe her BB by putting in the wrong password, then spelling out BLACKBERRY with the wrong password 10 times. Instead of asking me to reset it through the server, she nuked it. I can still hear her words to this day. **PR** finally ended the call by saying \n\n&gt;**PR**: I am Public Relations and I am the face of **Company**! I will be giving your name and department to my director so that he can charge you personally for my plane ticket! You are the reason I have missed my flight! You are the reason I will be late to this important meeting to **Company** and you, Mr. **LK**, will pay for every bit of this!\n\nShe then hung up again. In 30 minutes I’ve managed to say *Tech support, this is LK* to her 3 times and *Here is your Blackber...*. All I could think after that last phone call was *No, you work in PR, have an assistant as toxic as you are and no, in fact, you can't actually do that.* I'm kinda glad she hung up on me, I didn't get a chance to tell her how big of a bitch she was. Which I am 80% sure I could have gotten away with at that point.\n\nAt 730, I called **Lead**, explained everything to him b/c I knew this was going to blow way up the ladder before it was over and told him I was going home. He told me to log an hour of OT and come in an hour late to make up for the trouble. He said he'd get the phone guys to pull all the recording from her phone to our department and the original techs department for the entire day and see what all she said.\n\nFast forward a week or so. **PR** calls and I get her call on my phone. I *somewhat* loudly exclaim that **PR** LADY IS CALLING ME AGAIN!!!! ARGH!! **Director**, whose office is next to my cube, hears this and comes out. He waits until I hang up and asks \n\n&gt;**Director**: How was **PR’s** attitude. \n\n&gt;**LK**: Surprisingly pleasant. Why do you ask? What did you do? \n\n&gt;**Director**: If she is ever the least bit rude to anyone in *department*, let me know. \n\nHe then smiled and walked into his office without saying another word. I found out later that day from **LEAD** that **LEAD**, **Director**, **PR**, **PR-Manager** and **PR-Director** all had a come to Jesus meeting earlier that morning. It turns out that\n\n* She did not miss her flight. It left at 9pm that night (she did cut it close though, but that was after her telling everyone she had already missed it)\n* Her phone was wiped, but she admitted to continuing to put in the wrong password and not asking us to reset it before it got wiped \n* She pretty much admitted to everything. Which **Lead** and **Director** said was sad b/c her director had all the phone calls and emails queued up and ready to play/read the moment she denied any of it.\n\n**PR** got written up and given a final warning all in one shot. The next one would presumably involve HR, Security, a cardboard box and the front door. From that day until she was transferred to another state, she was the nicest person who ever called.\n\n**TL;DR** Angry PR lady threatened to make me personally pay for a plane ticket b/c she missed her flight. In reality, she did not miss her flight at all and she can't actually do that. It was all recorded and she got threatened with her job. Angry PR lady became nicest person in the company over night.\n\nEDIT - Some formatting\n\nEDIT 2 - More formatting to make my story more readable that I hope u/thetoastmonster will appreciate. :)\n\nEDIT 3 - Moved TL;DR to the end so it doesn't spoil the story.

        "text": "I work second level support for a company that processes payrolls. We have an online system that allows clients to log in and do their own payroll, manage employees, run reports, etc. \n\nI was finally able to close a ticket that had been opened for over a week, resulted in two WebEx recordings with the client from the first-level tech, one of which was 3 hours and 46 minutes  that only contained a six minute presentation at the beginning and a 17 minute presentation at the end, leaving over 3 hours of blank space in between, and finally an hour long conference call with the client explaining that the report is not faulty, she is (in a nice manner, of course!).\n\nSecond level techs rarely deal directly with the clients, that is the job of the first level tech. However, some situations necessitate us having to actually talk to them. This ticket was one of those cases because the first level tech didn't want to \"further frustrate the client\" by explaining that she was doing the report wrong.\n\nThe first level tech opened a Webex so that we could connect to the client's computer to see what she was doing. Here is the gist of the call:\n\n$Me: obviously, me\n\n$user: the client\n\n(Note: the first level tech never said a word other than, \"Hello\" and \"Thanks! Goodbye\"\n\n$Me: \"Okay, show me what you are doing to get the report.\"\n\n$user: \"I need a report of all employees that are NOT assigned to a job.\" (runs the report) \"See! No results. This report is broken.\"\n\n$Me: \"The report is not broken. All of your employees ARE assigned to a job so no one fits that criteria.\"\n\n$user: \"Oh. Okay\" (retries the report, selecting employees that ARE assigned to jobs, but only assigned to a specific location in the company) \"See! No results! This report is broken!\"\n\n$Me: (looking at a report on my system) \"I'm not seeing that any employees in that location were paid on that date, so there would be nothing to report.\"\n\n$user: \"Well, no, they wouldn't have been paid. We didn't add this location to the system until the next payroll.\"\n\n$Me: (what??) \"So, you're trying to get employees that were paid in LOCATION on 03/01/18, but you didn't actually add LOCATION until 03/08/18?\"\n\n$user: \"Yes.\"\n\n$Me: .....\n\n$user: \"Wait, that won't work, will it?\"\n\n$Me: \"Um, no.\"\n\n$user: \"Okay.\" (retries report, selecting the payroll for ALL job codes and ALL locations for 03/01/18) \"See! No results! This report is broken!\"\n\n$Me: (looking at information on my screen) \" I don't see that you processed a payroll on 03/01/18. You did process on 03/02/18. Try using that date.\"\n\n$user: \"But I want it for 03/01\"\n\n$Me: \"But you didn't process on 03/01. You processed on 03/02\"\n\n$user: \"So I can't use 03/01?\"\n\n$Me: \"No, you have to use the date of an actual payroll.\"\n\n$user: (retries report using the correct date, gets results) \"Hey! You fixed it!\"\n\n$Me: \"Yes... I fixed it.\" (facepalm)\n\ntl;dr: client kept insisting report was broken because all of the options she selected didn't apply to her payroll and resulted in no data. Finally convinced the client she was the one that was broken, not the report.",

        "text": "So this story starts of in 2007, I just got out of the military and landed my first civilian job working at a Large Houston Hospital's Help Desk department. It was the basic shit you would expect from a help desk, forgot my password, hardware and software issues nothing too special until the day I got a call from a VERY special customer.... I will call him MR. CFD.\n\nMe: \"Large Houston Hospital\" Help Desk how may I assist you?\n\nCFD: Yes, hello? Um... I need help.\n\nMe: That's no problem sir, what seems to the issue this morning? \n\nCFD: Well... (software name) isn't working...\n\nMe: Ok sir, what happens when you try to run your program.\n\nCFD: When I run this (software name I don't remember) it gives me a compiling error...\n\nNow I'm thinking to myself... compiling? Was this some shitty propriety software we had goosed up in some I.T. small developer area... Best part was no one knew of this software, it wasn't in our Knowledge Base and had no history of being part of our I.T. support software in tickets. So, I went back for more questioning to figure out what the hell this software was for, the customer explained it was for EMRs (Electronic Medical Records). My first assumption was this was a nurse, medical tech, or a Dr. Dipshit as I tend to call all the Dr.'s there, but that's a story for another time.\n\nSo, we go through the usual battery of restart your computer, I try to remote it but I cannot... Guys on a funky VPN of some sort. It's been a fucking hour and this guy just repeats the same shit over and fucking over of \"Failed to run compiling error nonsense\" and he explains furthermore...\n\nCFD: Yeah, I really need this software to work, this is my third day and I am so behind and my boss is really harping on me, you got to help me.\n\nMe: Ok, let’s try using this software to remote in... (HOLY SHIT IT WORKS MY GAWD I'M IN... BALLS DEEP INTO THIS FUCKING PC AND... wha?!\n\nI looked around... I see the error as this customer excitedly moves his mouse towards it... but I'm no longer concerned with that... I'm looking at the entirety of the situation.... Now I have done some coding at this point in my life and I know what code looks like, even if I'm not familiar with the code itself, what I’m looking at looks like a compiler. Now why in the hell is a medical tech... wait...... this guy wasn't a med tech or Doc... I asked him his title and departments name which turned out to be a fucking developer department and he was a fucking programmer… or so he told H.R. during the interview process... I have no idea how he got hired... \n\nMe: Sir, are you asking me to assist you in developing this application? \n\nCFD: Well, I need some help, see this application is being made in ColdFusion (CFD = ColdFusion Developer) and I need some help because I don't really know ColdFusion\nColdFusion was part of his job title when he sounded off.\n\nWell I'm dumbfounded, I decided to first to go ahead and get this goof off the phone as I asked for his boss’s name as I bullshit the reasoning is for our logging purposes which he was kind of resistant to provide but I lied saying it was policy here.\n\nMe: Well sir, I went over some of your code and realized that we are not developers at this help desk, we are technical support center for desktop and network related issues, we cannot assist you in programming this software. \n\nNow I'm just being an asshole at this point. CFD REALLY panics fucking hard.\n\nCFD: YOU HAVE TOO! YOU ARE THE HELP! DESK! DO YOU UNDERstand... \n\nGuy calms down somewhat or maybe he has a heart condition... hell I don’t know but then I explain to Mr. CFD that this is insanely beyond our scope here and you should talk to your boss.\nCFD: I just got this job, what do I do after telling my boss I don't know ColdFusion.\n\nI think for a moment...\n\nMe: Sir... update your resume.\n",

        "text": "On dark days, I remember a coworker's advice: \"Users are like Slinkys. They serve no useful purpose, but it's fun to give them a little push off the top stair\".\n\ntl;dr - *Password Resets are a secret test to see if users are too dumb to be allowed on a computer.*\n\n\nI have a few candidates for the Slinky treatment. To set the stage, one of the metrics we're graded on is \"Reopened Tickets\". Our target is pretty low, say 1 in 100. Some tickets don't count, which we refer to as the \"user is an idiot\" loophole: user reopens ticket to ask for something complete different, more information, or say \"Thanks!\". Because managers watch the metric and discuss it weekly, when the ticket is complete, we ask the user if the ticket can be closed and try to head off any problems.  4 times this month, I've had a ticket reopened. In the previous 12 months, I had 1 ticket reopened: \"Thanks! This Really Fixed it!\". \n\nWaiting on a vendor to get back to me, so I grab a simple ticket from the queue:  \"Please Reset my Password\".  Most password resets are self-service, or done by level-one, but this is a legacy application they don't ~~like~~ handle.\n\nI reset the password and account expiration; in about half these tickets, the user's password has expired since they haven't logged in in 60 days.\n\nIn our standard process, the temporary password is sent to the user in an email from the Incident management software.  I always end the email with \"Please let me know if I can close this ticket\" or something similar.  If they reply to the email, it's automatically logged to the ticket.  I also set the status of the ticket to \"Waiting on Customer\".  It doesn't stop the clock, but the system will email the user daily until they update the ticket.\n\nThere was no contact from user after 3 daily attempts so I closed the ticket on the 4th day.\n\n3 days later the user reopens ticket, \"Please advise new Password\".   Arrrgh!  Sent him the new password again, and added it to the ticket.  Since it's set to required changing on login, this is allowed.  Set the ticket to \"Waiting on Customer\".  A day later, he responds - \"Thanks, it works\".\n\n\nThe kicker - He created the same ticket a couple of days later. I set the **same** temp password, sent it via email, and put it in the ticket. That's allowed, since it is set to change-on-first-login. No contact after three attempts, on the fourth attempt \"What is new password?\". Emailed him, CC'd his manager:\n\n    Password is 12345, as reported in the first three emails and documented in the ticket. \n    You will have to change it the first time you log in.\n\nI wanted to say \"Password Test Failed.  Please Report to Soylent Green, Inc.  for Processing\".\n\n\n*I submitted these as a table, and it was rejected as \"Not A Story\".  Let's see if these work in narrative form.*",

        "text": "Confession: I am not IT support myself, but my job does involve assisting users with some distantly IT-related stuff.\n\nI work in a call center for a lab. We produce patient reports.  Doctors can access these reports online via our provider portal.  The portal is great. It is far superior to faxed reports.  It's clearer than fax, it's in color, it's interactive, it's less wasteful, you can download PDFs right there and immediately upload them to your medical records system, you can share reports instantly with your colleagues and patients and its pages won't get lost in the shuffle.  But alas, sometimes not even a medical degree can help you if you don't understand the basics of computers and the internet.\n\nSo I get a call from a physician.  She sounds young and on top of it.  She can't get in to the portal.  She has requested to reset her password, receives the reset password email, but the link brings her to a page telling her she cannot access this site. I may not be an IT person but this one's obvious. It's her security settings.  She works at a county hospital, so this doesn't surprise me.  Their systems are all out of date and their security restrictions are a pain to work around. There is nothing I can do on my end to change her security settings, and I explain all this to her.  I throw in the word \"firewall\" for good measure.  She seems to understand and says she'll access the portal on her home computer instead. Great, fine.  Otherwise, she'll need to contact her IT team. She doesn't tell me this is urgent, and flat out says she'll just work on it at home, so I leave it at that.\n\nShe calls back a little bit later and tells me the same thing as above.  I'm a little confused (did we not just go over this?) and I try to explain to her again why this isn't something I can fix for her. I ask if she has contacted her IT team, and she says, a little smugly, \"No, and I'm not going to because it's not on our end. I've tried several other computers here and my colleague confirmed he has had trouble with the link, too. It's a dead link.\"\n\nAgain, I am not IT. I can't dazzle her with IT talk about why she can't access the link on other computers that are all using the same internet connection and are subject to the same security restrictions. Also, I'm now working OT at this point. So whatever, it's our fault, we are sending \"dead links\", and it doesn't matter that our 100s of other users use the portal everyday just fine.\n\nI offered to secure email the report to her, but no, she was also having issues with that link. That puts into question whether she even knows how to use activation links at all, but I don't care to argue with her, I really should be off by now and there is one last resort... the dreadfully wasteful, slow, black and white fax.\n\nFax it is, then!\n\n\n\n",

Kind of the main tech person from what I could tell. \n\n* $Joe — Other tech, dealing with another user\n\n\nBackground\n---------------------\nI'm a 9th grade student at $STEMSchool, who is affiliated with $University.  $University lets us use their Office 365 and Exchange. Their $CuteMammelThemedHelpDesk helped me setup their email service on my phone through IMAP.\n\nStory\n-------\n\nI walk into the building and walk up stairs to $Jeff's office. $Jeff welcomes me and shows me around the office. Afterward, we go to his office and start working on tickets. One to open up all of the ports on an IP phone. A few password resets etc. During this time I asked some questions and learned more about how things like the helpdesk. We went to lunch and came back to something fun.\n\nSomeone was moving their email service from $ExchangeProvider1 to $ExchangeProvider2.\n\n&gt;$Jeff: Email is always a bit finicky. Sometimes email services won't let you know if the server on the other end stops existing, and people are touchy about it too\n\nIf only we knew....\n\nWe only had to move 5 inboxes, so moving data between the Exchange Servers would have been overkill, not to mention $ExchangeProvider1's policies making that kind of move difficult. Instead,  everyone at $ClientCompany just switched to temporary passwords and we moved the inboxes.\n\nJust one problem...\nThe providers servers didn't like mailbox exchanges, so, after a few fruitless attempts, we moved to IMAP based methods, which outlook won't do without a valid outbound server on the sending end because.... reasons? Anyway, the only way to get IMAP/SMTP access through $ExchangeProvider1's \"free\" Office 365 inclusion, more specifically, the OWA. OWA refused to help at first, blocking the screen with failed Cross-Site Security Checks. Inspect Element worked to fix it though\n\nSo we go to the IMAP settings in OWA.\n\n&gt;Server : outlook.office365.com\n&gt;\n&gt;Port: 995\n&gt;\n&gt;Security: SSL\n\n and put them into Outlook \n\nSo we go to the IMAP settings in OWA.\n\n&gt;Server : outlook.office365.com\n&gt;\n&gt;Port: 587\n&gt;\n&gt;Security: SSL\n\nThey didn't work...\nWe tried solutions to fix this in many ways. Then I decided to try something in a last ditch attempt\n\n&gt;$me : Hey $Jeff, mind if I check something on my phone really fast?\n&gt;$Jeff: Sure\n\nI then go to my email app and [open settings for Outbound mail... ](https://i.imgur.com/oGyYd1y.png)\n\n&gt; $me: Try changing the SMTP auth to TLS.\n\nIt worked.\n\nLater, we told $Joe how we fixed it, and he said some words of wisdom I will never forget\n\n&gt;$Joe: Documentation is a description how the programmers want the system to work, not of how it works.\n\nAt this point we wrapped up for the day, and I ended up with a story in how tech support works that changed my view.\n\nEND\n\nEdit: Edited to fit the rules of the subreddit, and to format",

        "text": "I'm just hired for my first real engineering/technician job by company X. I'd done some freelance programming before this but that's about it.\n\nCompany Y makes widgets for government, but stopped 10 years ago due to the economic situation and the lack of government budgets.\nRecently, they wanted to start making the widgets again, and contracted with company X to make that happen.\n\nI was, of course, handed a compiled binary for the embedded processor on the widgets, and told to make it work. No source code, only the barest whiff of documentation, and none of the people who worked on the original project still work there.\n\nOf course, it couldn't be some kind of normal embedded processor compatible with modern tools. Instead, the widget uses a 15-year old digital signal processor with a toolchain that only runs on Windows XP.\n\nAfter two weeks spent trying to get it to work, I have a (partial) solution. None of the computers that were available worked with XP, but I could run it in a virtual machine.\nWindows XP boots, the toolchain loads, and it even recognizes that there's a widget board plugged in.\nAnd the moment I attempt to program the widget board, the entire hypervisor crashes.\n\nSpend the next week trawling the google, trying various suggestions. Eventually determine that it's a problem with USB passthrough, so I add a USB PCI card and do PCI passthrough.\nStill doesn't work, but this time it fails _differently_! Progress!\n\nSpend another week trawling the google, and finally determined that the computer I was running the VM from wasn't compatible, because the CPU lacked a particular feature. So I get another computer with that feature.\nGetting closer, this time failed with a BSOD when installing the USB drivers in XP, so I try a few other cards.\nNone of them work either, but they all failed differently!\nEventually order a dozen different USB cards from amazon, and one works! It's a super-expensive $110 card, but at this point it doesn't matter. I'm able to flash the widgets.\n\nThen the hard part: I can flash the widgets, but none of them _work_. Well, the old ones that already worked still work, but none of the newly-manufactured widgets work.\nRemember there's no source code - believe me I asked, company Y doesn't have it either.\n\nNow if you thought understanding x86 or ARM assembly was hard, let me tell you, DSP assembly is _far worse_. Unlike on sane processors, where things like multiplication and branch instructions actually make sense, on a DSP there is no logic or reason for anything. Every single opcode is capable of running concurrently with any other opcode, any opcode can be a branch instruction depending on whether it feels like it at the moment, and the only way to tell if (or which) branch will be taken is to wait and see, because it depends not only on the opcode result, but also on a bunch of extra flag registers, the phase of the moon, and whether you sacrificed enough goats to the computer gods that morning.\n\nSo I spend the next week trying to puzzle out exactly what's going on here, and eventually manage to narrow it down to a problem with the serial communication.\nThe particular serial chip is a slightly later revision than the one used on the original widgets, but the datasheets are identical and the manufacturer asserts they should work exactly the same.\n\nOf course, I don't believe them, and rig everything up with a logic analyzer to be sure, and go over the datasheets with a fine-tooth comb to try and find anything at all that might be different.\nEventually I find it - apparently the new chip has a special mode it can be put in by setting all of it's registers to particular values. No biggie, the original datasheet says very clearly not to do that even on the old version of the chip, so it should be fine right?\nNope, dig through the assembly, the original programmers apparently just ignored every piece of advice in the original datasheet about how to use the chip and just _happened_ to engage this special mode on accident.\n\nSo, now to fix it. By this point I've got a basic idea for how to write code for this thing, so I begin working on an assembly patch, finish it, and try it out.\n\nLo and behold, apparently only the _dis_assembler works, and any \ntime I try to use the assembler everything crashes. So now I'm in a hex editor, hand-assembling code like it's 1950.\n\nEventually manage to patch the code, doesn't work.\nTry a bunch of other ways to fix it, still doesn't work.\nEventually we manage to find a supplier that has a bunch of old stock of the old part revision and we purchase it all, and swap the new chip out for the old one on a bunch of widgets, and.... still none of the new widgets work.\n\nGo back to the debugger, still a problem with serial communication.\n\nEventually after another week trying to figure this out, managed to figure out that it's actually a problem with the chip's quartz crystal circuit.\nI'm completely out of my depth at this point - to be honest I was already out of my depth, but I had literally _no_ idea what to try here, so managed to get one of the analog design engineers at the company to help.\n\nFinally after months of effort, I was able to ship the first set of new widgets to Company Y.\n\n---------\n_In our next expisode: Return of Company Y! \nHow long can our hero survive the clutches of master control program?\nBig Brother is always watching, but why is the bitrate so low?\nWhen lightning strikes at the eleventh hour, will the failover system come online?\nWhen things heat up after prolonged sunlight exposure, can our hero cool off enough to stay sane?\nWill he be arrested by Mexican border control?\nWill last-minute script-fu save the day?\nTune in next time to find out!_",

By a while back, I mean around Thanksgiving.  To make matters fun, a grad student is in charge here.\n\nNow we pride ourselves on having speedy software, and a lot.of that is we insist on dedicated hardware with metadata stored locally.  This is not negotiable.  I'm sure you see where this is going.\n\nAround Christmas, the guy in charge finally benchmarked their hardware, and had some changes made.  They wanted to host the binaries locally and everything else on NFS.  Not happening - we need metadata locally.  And eventually this gets done.\n\nThen radio silence.\n\nLast week, we hear back - they have licensing questions and are ready to install.  Eyes are rolled, caffeine is consumed, all is alright with the world.  We figure out what's needed, and then set up and installation meeting for two hours ago.\n\nI log onto WebEx and get their IT guy on the phone.\n\n$DudeBroIT: Hey dude &lt;loud clacking of mechanical keyboard&gt; will we need to share screens? &lt;More clacking&gt; Cause this isn't really working.\n\n$Me: Yeah.  Are you on Linux?  Cause that's not going to work.  Can you ssh in from Windows?\n\n$DudeBroIT: &lt;loud clacking for 15 seconds&gt; yeah man, no problem\n\nTen minutes and WebEx breaking on my machine later, we're ready to go.  I'm looking at their ssh interface interestedly 'cause I've never seen it before.  TigerVNC and No machine are what I see a lot.  I get the dependencies installed and notice the hostname has changed from the alphabet soup it used to be.  And df -hT shows a grand total of 25 GB disk space.  There used to be 1.8TB.  The grad student in charge has joined is in the meantime\n\n$Me: This looks like a different machine than what was qualified.  Where'd all the disk space go?\n\n$DudeBroIT: Uhhh ... I dunno.  Hey $GradPeon, what's happening now?\n\n$GradPeon: Uhhh ... I dunno dude.  We were gonna put everything on NFS\n\n$Me: Well, the metadata needs to be kept locally.  Can you add some drives to the machine?  Like around 250GB?\n\n$DudeBroIT: Yeah, sure, gimme a sec\n\n$Me: &lt;looking at the interface closer&gt;   Wait.  Is this a VM\n\n$GradPeon: Uhh ... yeahhhh\n\n$Me: Ok, let me get my boss in the loop.  \n\nIt's a pro-bono setup, maybe they don't care.  Either way, my boss ($Al) gets to handle this.  I just install shit.\n \n$Me: Hey, we've got a problem.  $DoeEyes is trying to set up on a VM\n\n$Al: &lt;looks up from underwear shopping.  truly a lowlight of the day&gt; What?  I'm calling $VPSales.  Stall a moment. &lt;pulls out phone, dials, starts talking&gt;\n\nMeanwhile the dudebro engineer and IT guy are getting annoyed.  Why can't we just keep going?  Cause minimum standards are local hardware.  Can we install here and then move it over next week to hardware? Lolno.  That's a pain in my ass.\n\nI can hear them talking, probably to a lab supervisor or professor.  Can't make out what they're saying cause their keyboards are stupid loud still.  Eventually they ask for minimum specs.  Back to sales, cause I know minimum rack server model only.\n\nThey hear the specs and are insulated, a bit.  4 cores, 8 GB ram, RAID 1.  Ask why they can't use the VM.  The answer is disk speed.  Writes and reads are slower.  Sorry, not my rule.\n\nEventually, they can down a bit and sign off.  Just before we're completely done, I hear one mutter about benchmarking the VM so they can prove it's fast enough.  \n\nGood luck, I saw the number of VMs hosted on that server.  The benchmarks are almost exclusively file reads and writes.\n\nHonestly, they're not a large team, just get a skull canyon for this, add two NVMes and 8GB ram, and you'll be fine.  Seriously.  It'll cost less than a year of a one person license.",

Some background: we just replaced all of our network gear and put AP's in every class room we support.  We are replacing our old Cisco 7941's this summer and I have no spares so its duct tape and bailing wire for now. We've told the techs to take out all dumb switches and utilize Wi-Fi for several reasons, not to mention Wi-Fi works just fucking fine. Also the tech who created this fiasco was with me on site when I purposely left several 30 ft cables in the MDF for him to use.  Any who.... I get a ticket today that reads Phone is No working, yes that’s what is says.  Ok so I take a look in call manager and the phone is getting an IP but isn't registered, so I jump over to the Meraki dashboard, find the port the phone is in and it has power but no client no data transferring, weird I reboot the port nada. So I grab my trusty backpack and head out, why not it's a lovely drive and starting to snow.  I arrive on site and thankfully no one is in the room so I investigate. Let me set the scene, on one side of the room is a phone about 20 feet away are 2 MACs and the wall jack.  I see a cable going from the wall to the phone, then a cable coming out of the phone about 10 feet, back towards the MACs, and there sits in all her glory an 8 port linksys switch another 5 feet from there a beautiful 4 port netgear switch that is connected to the 2 MACs.  I am not sure whether to laugh or cry at this point.  I removed the switches rebooted the phone and what do you know everything is coming up Millhouse.  I login to the MAC's, wireless is on and connected to the guest network, of course why the fuck not, redundancy ya know. I put them on the right network pack up and throw the switches in the dumpster when I leave.  I texted my boss and told him we need to have a beer and a discussion about dumb switches after work.\n",

Customer calls us and tells us that when they power up their PC, it starts playing Wolfenstein 3D. No matter what button is pressed, it just keeps on going. I asked about what LEDs are lit on the PC, and learn it indeed is powered on and judging the HDD light flickering it also has loaded the OS or at least attempts it. The game however can't be stopped and I drive out to the customer.\n\nThe PC is powered down as I arrive. It's one of those older machines with AT PSU that also powers up the monitor. I turn on the machine and whoa, I first get \"Check VGA cable!\" and then the familiar early 90s DOS game-looking maze. It obviously wasn't Wolf 3D, but looked very much like it, closer to the 3D maze screensaver in early Windows NTs.\n\nI look behind the PC and immediately locate the problem: the VGA cable is unplugged. After I reconnect the cable I'm greeted with Windows 98 login screen.\n\nApparently whoever wrote the firmware for the huge CRT screen had had too much time on their hands and they had recreated the maze screensaver to it instead of the typical bouncing box with \"NO SIGNAL\".",

Not an employee. \n$Tech = duh\n$Me = Texasgunowner12\n\n&gt; $V2 - Hi can you change the password for *VIP* her outlook is not letting her log in.  \n&gt; $Tech - Is *VIP* there to confirm that she needs her password changed? I only ask because of security policy.  \n&gt; $V2 - No she is 400 miles away giving a presentation. She can only access her outlook inside the VM Ware system. It throws the error on the local desktop.  \n&gt; $Tech - Ah ok this is actually a common error. The VM Ware and outlook share the same password. What is likely happening is a corrupt outlook profile on her local PC or credential manager mismatch. If I can connect with *VIP* I can get this fixed in 5 minutes.  \n&gt; $V2 - Can I speak with your manager.  \n&gt; $Tech - Hold please. *Warm Xfers the call to me* Hey. *VIP's* Daughter on the phone. Sounds like a corrupt outlook profile or credential manager mismatch.  \n&gt; $Me - Let me guess she refuses to talk with you?  \n&gt; $Tech - Yup. Sending her now.  \n&gt; $Me - This is $me with *our company* help desk.  \n&gt; $V2 - Yeah my mom needs access to her outlook and she is stating that she has no time for IT to mess with her PC.  \n&gt; $Me - Wait... has she been on the phone with you this entire time?  \n&gt; $V2 - Yes.  \n&gt; $Me - *VIP* Please call me at ext *my number*\n\nNo call. No nothing for two days. \n\n&gt; $ME - Thanks for calling the help desk what can I assist you with today.  \n&gt; $V2 - This is *VIPs* Daughter. I need you to reset her password. Outlook is not letting her in. She has to use the VM Ware to access it.  \n&gt; $ME - Then nothing is wrong with her password. VM Ware and outlook share the same password.  \n\nShe hung up. \n\nOne week later I am informed that a corrective action investigation is being generated on the incident where myself and my tech refused to change the password for a user. \n\nWe were interviewed by two guys form another team as this corrective action investigation involved a supervisor. Normally I would do these. \n\nWe gave them all of the information available and then called the vip themselves and got her fixed. Dont know whether it was a credential manager mismatch or a corrupted outlook profile as the guy who employed the fix wiped credential manager, deleted, and re-added the outlook profile. After reapplying her signatures, he got her back up and running in 5 minutes. \n\nThe report was submitted and a meeting was held between the CIO, me, the tech involed, and some random HR person who said nothing during the entire meeting. \n\nThey went over the original issue, discovered that the fix we suggested weeks ago worked and took less than 10 minutes to fix, and that we never once actually said no. \n\n&gt; $CIO - And according to the corrective action report it was deemed that *VIP* should have just called into the help desk originally instead of asking her daughter to call. In the future *VIP* is instructed to call the help desk first... So can anyone here tell me why no one signed this report?  \n&gt; $me - You already know the answer to that question. No one wants to tell *VIP* that she is wrong. Neither do you.\n\nThis garnered a snorting laugh from the HR person. We were dismissed with the promise of both HR person and CIO that this would be buried for a month before being quietly filed. ",

This was an established feature, but they just made a major change to the database that impacts ALL triggers.  Each morning we have a \"stand-up\" to make sure the whole team is on the same page.    \n\\* *End Setting* \\*\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Monday:**\n\n**Me:** \"I want to make all the testers aware: all of the triggers are in separate code bases, and this database change impacts all of them.

        "text": "The project was written mostly in Java, with some shell scripts to glue it together, and ran on Solaris. They were notorious within COMPANY for resisting rules, processes, best practices, standards; if somebody else wrote it down they immediately refused to follow it, and they refused to write anything down themselves. Constant headaches, but what they did was a critical part of our business so we couldn't just let them faceplant.\n\nThe application had a problem and barfed on our monitoring, it wasn't clear to the L1 guys whether it was an us problem or a them problem, and it was my week in the SA oncall barrel, so they paged me. I saw pretty quickly that the problem was in the app somewhere; whether it was code, data, or both was not my problem, I called the app team's oncall.\n\nDEV was new. Like, probably didn't have his door badge yet new, hired late the previous week; yet for some reason they'd put him on call. There were only two possibilities; either he was that good, or they didn't care and just threw him in there. I knew immediately it was the latter, but I wasn't going to cut this guy's ankles off by going over his head, so I told him the errors and he said he'd get back to me.\n\nA couple of hours later he came to me with a patch to his software that he said would fix the problem, and said he didn't know how to load it. No problem, we actually did the software loads for this team at the time, so I told him what document to fill out and where to put the tarball so the software distribution tool could pick it up. Then I explained what \"tar\" was because he had never heard of it, and didn't know we couldn't just pick up a bunch of random files and move them wherever. At this point I knew this wasn't going to go well, because he couldn't even have gotten through testing without having this ready for load, but since the RFC he was going to have to create was going to require test documentation and be signed by his manager, I figured they'd educate him on that end. Go ahead and laugh, I deserve it.\n\nThe RFC comes in and it's a travesty; the test documentation was just the word \"yes\", and the filename of the patch made it clear it wasn't something our tool could push, and after making the tarball he'd compressed it separately with Zip (our tool expected either a naked tarball, or one compressed with UNIX \"compress\" or \"gzip\", and some of the metadata necessary for pushing a patch is found in the filename.) Yet somehow his manager had signed off on all of this.\n\nSo I coached him through renaming the tarball something rational, and since it was small just leaving off the compression entirely. Then I coached him through moving it into the right directory so our tool would find it.\n\nAmazingly, the patch actually applied cleanly once all this was done; unsurprisingly, the software wouldn't even start after applying it. Now remember, this is a Java application running on Solaris. The errors involved inability to find various files in C:\\Program Files, C:\\Windows, etc.\n\nQueue Excedrin Headache Number PEBKAC. I contacted DEV:\n\n&gt; me: Hey, this patch blew up your app completely, it's looking for files in c:\\Program Files. That's not going to work on Solaris.\n\n&gt; dev: Well can you copy the files from wherever they are over to those directories?\n\n&gt; me: Dude, \"c:\" isn't a thing, it's Solaris, not Windows. Your Test servers are Solaris too, how did this pass testing?\n\n&gt; dev: We have a test server? I just tested it on my desktop. Do you know the name of the test server?\n\n&gt; me: How can you possibly not know how to test your code? It's a requirement for literally everything.\n\n&gt; dev: Oh I was just hired last week, they didn't give me any training, just set my desktop up to check out the code and showed me how people use the app. The rest of the team is at lunch, could you walk me through this?\n\nI didn't walk him through it. I called the manager and told him the app was down, and that he needed to get somebody to box up their damn lunch and get back to the office because his users were twiddling their thumbs. Turns out they were already on their way back, because users had started calling him directly about the delay.\n\nThe new guy actually stuck around and learned how to do his job. I don't blame him for any of this stuff, I blame the manager.\n\ntl;dr: development team hired a new guy, told him basically nothing about the environment, and put him on Production oncall so they could go to lunch in peace. Hilarity ensued.\n",

Wassup?  \n\n&gt;**$Fam**: Just got back from **$BuyNLarge** with a new surveillance system for **$Business**. But I can't access the feeds. **$MetalBrowser** (not to be confused with $MetalBowser) wants to install a plugin to see them, but it happens so fast that I can't see anything on the screen. Closed **$MetalBrowser** and re-opened it, and the plugin install keeps downloading. I've got about ten of this \"webapp.exe\" file in my downloads. Same for **$FlamingDoggieBrowser**.  \n\n&gt;**$Databoy2k**: [ah, the sweet feeling of dread. I know you well. Strike 1.] So, let's be clear here: both **$MetalBrowser** and **$FlamingDoggieBrowser** are phasing out plugins in their entirety, partially because the use of plugins belongs in the year 2000. So we're not off to a good start. Let's fire up the browser that is holier than the Pope.  \n\n[insert conversation which illustrates locating of that-web-browser-which-doesn't-deserve-a-named-variable in **$ModernMicrosoftOS**; this does in fact include a lesson that you can type immediately after pressing the funky squares button on your keyboard to search for installed software^idrinkthereforeiam]\n\n&gt;**$Fam**: Nope, this still isn't working. I don't get it. I'm going to the correct website that **$FormerTech** set up. http://camera.$Businessname.com:[port].  \n\n&gt;**$Databoy2k**: [blink. blinkblink. cough. wave at the nice police officer driving by on the other side looking at the clearly-seizing driver of my vehicle. somewhere, a voice calls out \"Strike 2\"] Please tell me that when you typed that into your browser, the \"http\" part became \"https\".  \n\n&gt;**$Fam**: No, it just disappeared. Then I put in my username, \"user\" [nope, not using a variable there either], and the password that he e-mailed me... [suddenly interrupted by **$Databoy2k** yelling out \"STRIKE THREE !!! YER OUTTA THERE\"]  \n\n&gt;**$Databoy2k**: So, tonight you're firing **$FormerTech**. Tomorrow, a friend of mine who knows his ass from a hole in the ground and has heard of the magical portal of SSL will be calling you. He will give you a quote. You will listen to him carefully. And next time **$MetalBrowser** advises you that a site is \"Not Secure\" you will cease inputting any data into any field on that page, close said browser, back away from your computer, and not frequent said page again. [and I'm going to pull over to the side of the road until I can safely drive without being under the influence of rage-enhancing drugs, a.k.a. stupid tech actions perpetrated on my own family]  \n\nOnce home, I did a few searches. The cameras that he purchased do in fact require ActiveX plugins for the web browser. Their publisher is \"Not Available\" and their names are both \"Plugin Class\". Even *that browser* complains bitterly when you use them. Once pushing through the morass, though, I confirmed that the password that was given (which was 14 alpha-numeric, apparently random characters, and which, mercies, did not appear in the pwned passwords database at HIBP, so I'm guessing was in fact generated at random) was incorrect, which isn't helping matters. \n\nThere does, however, appear to be a dedicated program for those who cringe at the thought of not using **$MetalBrowser** or a secure equivalent. No word on whether it prefers the comfort of SSL.\n\nMy understanding is that at the time of publication, this is no longer the case. Long live decent techs; off with the heads of those who know not that which they are doing.\n\nTL;DR: \"Exposing security system login pages to the World Wide Web on unencrypted connections in 2018 is grounds for termination of your technical support contract\" says the Living T-Rex Lawyer. \n\nedit: Maybe this formatting is less ugly.",

        "text": "Preface: I work as a web developer for a contracting company, and my system administration skills are not great.\n\nAlso, everything is rather abbreviated compared to how it actually happened. I hope you'll forgive this artistic license.\n\nOur members:\n\n$Me - Me\n\n$PM - Project manager for the company we got the contract for\n\n$SysAdm - System administrator at the client company\n\n~~$braindead~~ $Ruby - Developer at the client company\n\n&gt;**$PM:** We have a legacy PHP application that provides reports for managers each quarter. This application used to work fine, but since we entered in the new data, the application no longer functions at all.\n\n*Contract negotiations commence.*\n\n&gt;**$PM:** We're really not looking to spend more than $1,000 on this problem. We're rewriting our application in $Language and don't want to spend this kind of money fixing old code when we're on the verge of releasing the new version.\n\nThis is all fine. Except, $PM proceeds to be quite bitchy about our rate and agrees to a smaller up-front investment so that they can decide if it's worth spending more money investigating / fixing the issue. Keep in mind, this application is used by around 8 different chains spanning hundreds (probably thousands) of locations. It's not exactly critical, as this is the back-end tool for managers. The $PM insists this is super ultra high-priority (when do clients not, am I right), but they can't spend what I see as chump change on about only 2 full days of work.\n\n*After everything is signed, we are finally given more details on the problem.*\n\nSo it turns out, these guys built a PHP application approximately 8 years ago, and have not bothered to update it since. I only estimate its age based on the archaic version of CakePHP used by this application. They have since gotten rid of all of their PHP developers, and while they still have other developers, none of them either felt like debugging the problem or they were unsuccessful. We never found this out.\n\nWith details being provided to us, we get the email detailing the problem.\n\n&gt;**$Ruby:** This application works by ingesting an uploaded CSV file, sending it off to a data processing API, and storing the results from that external processing in our database. This data is then used to generate the reports for the managers when they want to view them.\n\nSo far so good.\n\n&gt;**$Ruby:** Everything was working fine until this quarter. We passed some bad CSV data to the API and got some bad results in our database. We have since fixed the bad CSV data and removed the data from the database. The import of this bad data completed successfully, but after fixing the problems, the import no longer works.\n\n*Spidey-senses tingling*\n\n&gt;**$Me:** So things stopped working after you deleted data from the database?\n\n&gt;**Ruby:** Yes\n\n&gt;**$Me:** Can't you just restore a backup of the database from before the botched import, and re-import with the good CSV data?\n\n*A very long pause in response here as it's the weekend*\n\n&gt;**$SysAdm:** We don't have any backups for this data.\n\nF$ck.\n\nProceed to debugging. I'm given PHPMyAdmin credentials (an online MySQL database tool) and SSH credentials. I tried to export their data from PHPMyAdmin for backup purposes because I'm lazy. PHP has a max execution time limit, typically 30-300 seconds. This limit is hit before the data export is complete, so I get an incomplete database dump.\n\n&gt;**$Me:** *Casually asks for MySQL credentials so I can use the command line tool from SSH*\n\n&gt;**SysAdm:** *Provides incorrect login details*\n\nI find the credentials in the PHP app's config file and dump the database myself. Aren't backups great? Gee.\n\nEventually I debug the import process to failing due to a database constraint. The app pulls a manager from the database as a foreign key. They deleted the manager from the database. So I tell them exactly which CSV line the import fails on, and my findings and suggest they add the manager to the database.\n\n*7 hours into the workday after firing off our findings to the client*\n\n&gt;**$PM:** Thanks, our developers were able to add the manager to the database and the import process worked\n\nFacepalm.\n\n(Other than outputting debugging information, I didn't have to change a single line of the PHP code. Not surprising.)\n\nAlso fun fact: they rerouted log files per application on their server, but they didn't do a great job of it. Automatic log file changing (e.g. php.log.1 php.log.2 etc.) never happened. I accidentally vi'd a 2G log file because I didn't think to check its size first. (Fun fact 2: each page load generated 100kb of errors / warnings)",

        "text": "I saw a post over on /r/Salesforce where users referenced this subreddit and had to share.\n\nLet's go back to the beginning. I've been at my company for about 1.5 years now and spent the first half trying to figure out how to fit in and the rest of the time cramming to master Salesforce and develop the system so that my team can use them. It's a small company of 10 but we are looking to expand very soon so this is only a little bit important.\n\nEventually, I proved to the owner and IT guy that I was indeed capable of working as the Salesforce Admin. I put together a 6 month plan to develop Salesforce in phases and gave the usual advice. Training is important, bugs will happen, this should have been done a long time ago so there's going to be some rocky times. I have to say the first 3ish phases went great! I was able to set up the basic lead processes and got pretty much up to winning and fulfilling contracts until it all fell apart.\n\nFor the purpose of this story, know that phase 3 involved automation for creating projects and managing opportunity stages (sales cycle stages) and phase 4 was user set up like profiles, roles, permissions, etc.\n\nPhase 3 comes out. It's great. It lasts a whole week and I hear absolutely 0 complaints. A big chunk ended up not even being developed because they took it a different direction (which is great). I told them all through phase 3 and its launch and after its launch that we needed to have people trained or there likely would be problems. But, oh no, it didn't happen then. It waited.\n\nThe next week goes by and I begin phase 4. It goes pretty well, a couple bugs but nothing crazy.\n\nThe week following (this week) it blows up something fierce. I get in at 9 and by 10:30 these 5 of the 10 people I work with are sending emails and screen caps of errors left and right. I seriously thought something must have gone critically wrong with Salesforce. Keep in mind, I was already trying to resolve an issue from last week regarding a particular users ability to log their time.\n\nI was worried until I got into the errors. A couple were valid errors but didn't take more than an hour to identify and resolve. But the vast majority were training problems. \n\n\"Why can't I edit this record\" because it's in an approval process and set to lock during.\n\n\"Why can't I select this stage\" because that's not how you update the stage and you don't even have access to that stage anymore.\n\n\n\nBut my absolute favorite:\n\n\"Why can't I save this task? Here's a screenshot\" while creating a task.\n\nNow, I get it. I did not get the chance to walk them through how to create the task record. But the error message listed the very fields they needed to complete. And they all were lookup fields for related records (that all of them knew and understood) and a single date field that's just a due date for the task.\n\nAbout this time I lost my mind a bit. I showed the owner who was nearby at the time and his response was laughter and \"good luck with that one\". So, even he knew what had to be done and he's one of the lesser knowledgeable people when it comes to Salesforce.\n\nBut, it didn't stop for me there. By this time I am 4 conversations deep trying to train everyone on why the errors are popping up. Just about the time I start to get out of the fire, the other owner gets me on the line. He pulls the plug and tells me to revert everything back to the previous phase because \"The team is overwhelmed with all these new processes and can't handle more processes in Salesforce\".\n\nI didn't fight it. I turned off everything around what they said the problem was. How much is that? 1 approval process. The rest were permission errors that had to be resolved by not rolling back but correcting. I only had to turn off a couple processes dependent on that approval process and those were just automatic record creation or updating. \n\nThe real kicker? Phase 4 was the last stage for basic processes. Had they given me the time and access to train the team (which could have been done in less than 30 minutes for Sales and 30 for Production/Finance) all of this would very likely have been avoided or at least easier to resolve. At least some of the issues would be avoided. I don't know what training will tell a person that when the system says \"Complete the end date field\" they need to complete the end date field...\n\nThe end result was all the permission errors were fixed, they realized that training is important, and I now have 7 months of development and training sitting and waiting for a month or longer until the owner says the team has the capacity for 30 minutes of training. What he doesn't know is that rolling back the changes only caused more bugs, a misaligned org, and had minimal influence on the actual issue. \n\nThe lesson I have learned: You can lead a horse to water, but if it's too dumb to drink it might kill itself. So, take baby steps and be ready for set backs. Don't kill the horse.\n\n",

        "text": "Besides my regular job as the main IT at a small Medical Center, I sometimes help out family, friends and coworkers with their IT problems. This is a story from one of those times. I'm one to own up to my screw ups and early-morning, no-coffee brain-deadness. Not sure which one applies here.\n\nCoworker came up to my office one fine morning and put his wife's $mostpopularsmartphone on my desk, letting me know that he'd recently had the screen replaced and now it wouldn't turn on or charge. He asked if, in my spare time, I could take a look at it. It had a lot of photos his wife had taken over the last year or so, and he asked if I could either get the phone to work or try to salvage the photos.\n\nFortunately, he'd come to me at 6 AM, when only one of our 6 floors was open for business, and thus I had about 2.5 hours before the deluge of the standard \"I can't type/print/log in\" tickets started coming in. This is the time I usually reserve for resolving any major issues left over from the day before, but again, as luck (this will play a major role here) would have, none were in my queue. \n\nSo I cleared a work space, took out my tools and started working on it. Obviously, I made sure everything was as he said, and indeed the phone neither turned on, nor could charge from any of my wires. Now, I'd replaced the screen on similar phone myself a few times so I figured that whoever had replaced the screen had done a shoddy job of it. \n\nSo I pried open the phone with a pry tool, grabbed my tweezers...and accidentally hit the battery with them as I was taking off something covering one of the connectors. Saw a blue flash, smelled something burning, and thought to myself \"oh...s***\". I figured I'd ended the phone with that (at the very least needing a new battery) and decided to close it up and do that later.\n\nI left it on my desk, next to my phone exact same model of $mostpopularsmartphone, and when an hour later I decided to charge my phone, accidentally hooked it up. At which point it happily blinked to life and began to charge.\n\nAnd that's how I earned a free lunch and a pat on the back for a job \"well done\" from a very confused charge nurse.",

        "text": "Episode 118.  It just stuck me how long I've been doing this, and how many ~different tales~ I've been able to tell.  You'd think i'd run out.  And yet here I am, with another story.\n\nToday's tale starts out Monday.  A ticket for BancroftCurrency came in for a DNS record update.  It's a MX record change, but the unusual part about it, was the time.  They wanted it for Wednesday morning, at 9am.  This was one of those e-mails from a customer, that the words for, obviously came from someone else, but were sent by someone with the authority to ask for the changes.\n\nAllow me to explain why this is a bad idea.  DNS changes are not instantaneous.  At best they take \"some time\" at worst they take a whole day.  (The usual is around an hour..)  MX records control where your e-mail goes, which is pretty important to many businesses.  So this particular financial instituation has decided that they're going to break their e-mail, at 9am, on a Wednesday morning.\n\nBeing the dutiful little sysadmin that I am, I did the change, and e-mailed the Issac at 9:10 this morning.  Issac CC's on me on an e-mail to Laurens.  Who, seems to be the person who ordered this DNS change.\n\n....................................  You know the story doesn't end there ..............................\n\n10:34 am rolls around, and updates to the ticket start rolling in.   \"Isaac called in, indicating that all incoming e-mail is getting rejected.  They want us to put the old records back.\"  \n\nClassic.  I knew something was going to go wrong, but this is right up there with \"I did windows update on the exchange server at 10am Monday morning.\"    \n\nI swapped the MX records back, kicked the DNS servers to get the old records going out again, and called the customer.  Called.  CALLED.  Because, well, their e-mail wasn't going to be working for a while.  \n\nThe conversation was, interesting to say the least.  First, Issac wanted me to put both the new, and old MX records in place.  I told him that it was a very bad idea, and unless they had some kind of fancy e-mail backend I was unaware of, I shouldn't do it.  Issac got Laurens on the line, and then things got worse.  \n\nLaurens was convinced that having both DNS entries was ok.  I started to ask about weather they were running IMAP or POP3, and neither person on the phone seemed to understand what I was talking about.  The explanation that worked,  was one that emphasized that \"If we have both mail systems listed, people will randomly get rejected e-mails, with no pattern.\"  \n\nI asked why they were doing a mail server change at 9am.  Laurens said \"The people at Dimitri said we could do this at any time.\"  \n\nThis lead to a long explanation of how to do a smooth mail transition.  We also ran into a speed-bump, we have no idea why the new mail provider was bouncing e-mail.  Nobody at BancroftCurrency had bothered to contact the new mail provider to see what was going on at their end.  \n\nAnd that's where we stand.  I sent Issac and Laruens off to find out what went wrong at Dimitri's server, and asked them to schedule this change at end of business, rather than during the busy part of the day.  \n\nToday's lesson: Don't mess with production systems DNS during the day.",

        "text": "I show up to my helpdesk job for the university I attend expecting nothing all too exciting. Before our morning meeting, one of the professors we support dialed our number and needs technicians to take a look at her laptop right away. The reason she gave was rather alarming:\n\n\"A stalker is trying to access my laptop!\"\n\nAnother colleague of mine and I decided to take this issue on, not only because we couldn't resist the mystery behind it, but because we assumed it was just an old geezer not up to date on computer terminology. Once we reached her office, we immediately discover that this is a personal machine of hers, not the department issued machine she should be using in her office. This means that we had NO obligation to help her and we could do very little. But she insisted through moaning and pouting that we help her anyway. For the sake of curiosity and avoiding confrontation, we assisted despite the fact we had zero obligation. We chose to help.\n\nShe's an older lady, most likely near 60 years old, so we naturally assumed the odds of it being your traditional \"stalker\" were damn near zero. But we still needed to know what happened, and the story wasn't exactly what we expected. The professor informs us she was back home in France the week prior and a stalker of hers accessed her MacBook, created the \"guest user\" option to steal her information using a flash drive. He also got onto her gmail account and got her password for that and is attempting to hack into her computer currently. Now at this point she is back on campus in the US, not France, so it is even more asinine. After modifying a few settings and creating a new gmail account as well as resetting the password for the old account, we pry a little more because the story simply doesn't add up. She then spills the beans.\n\nThe professor informs us her trip back to France was no ordinary visit. She had a night of passion in Paris, and after riding this man like a stallion until the saddle wore out, he got onto her laptop to do the things mentioned previously. He then added her on all forms of social media and messaged her constantly.\nAs absurd as the backstory was, this was still a serious enough matter to take on. \n\nBefore going on, I should clarify there is nothing stupid about wanting your information to be safe and wanting to make sure someone unwanted has no access to your accounts. What followed is where it went straight downhill. After doing all we possibly could, she calls our office during my lunch the following day. After yelling continuously at my colleague who answered about how I \"didn't finish the job\", she says her stalker is still trying to login to her computer. Keep in mind this man is still in France, and the reason she assumes this is because the \"Guest User\" option is still on screen. Admittedly, that may have been on me, as there is a chance I did not apply the setting change I made in regards to guest access. But that is still no reason to blow up in that fashion. \n\nAfter I clocked back in I sent her an email explaining that this issue was no longer under our support. Not only because we couldn't do much else, but also because she demanded assistance despite being entitled to none. She immediately calls our office and I answer.\n\n\"IT this is OP\"\n*click*\n\nPhone rings again\n\n\"IT this is OP\"\n*click*\n\nBoth times she hung up immediately once she knew that I was the technician she was speaking to. So on the third time around, someone else answered.\n\n\"IT this is Joe how can I help you?\"\n\n\"Hi, this is Prof. Lastname, I have been having issues with security on my laptop.\"\n\n\"Oh this is the issue OP has been dealing with, let me transfer you.\"\n\nNow she is stuck with me. I use my bland customer service voice and ask how I can be of assistance. I ask if she got my email, she said she read it but basically she refuses to accept it. She goes on a rant about how it should be a departmental machine since she uses it at work and she demands she receives support. After going through the whole process and informing her of places where she can receive proper support she demands to speak to my supervisor. After placing her on hold I find out my supervisor is in a meeting and unable to take a call. I informed her she would have to call my supervisor at a later time or contact more appropriate support. The tone then completely changes.\n\n\"Please OP, just do me one favor. Come down and look at it for 5 minutes, for a professor in need.\" in the most puppy dog-like voice she could imitate. Feeling slight pity, I calmly informed her that I was unable to do anything else for her. She then dropped the short lived facade and said:\n\n\"You came here yesterday and helped there is no reason you can't come here right now.\"\n\nWith my patience completely gone I said what needed to be said:\n\n\"I showed up for support yesterday because I was under the impression the issues you were experiencing pertained to a university purchased machine, not your own. I was not obligated to assist you on this matter, chose to. I am not obligated to help you currently either, so the options you have are to call my supervisor later or support more suitable for your case.\"\n\nAfter thinking for a moment she thanked me for trying and informed me she was calling the police on this matter anyhow. Makes me wonder why she didn't do that in the first place.\n",

Things like that.\n\nWe always do this on a Sunday (statistically our quietest day) and always email everyone the Monday before, and then a reminder on the Friday. Always saying the same thing, you won't be able to get on our terminal servers or client/case management software, but emails will continue to work on your phones (we're 365) and thus begins the tale.\n\n\nD: = Me\nU1: = User1\nU2: = User2 Also a director...\n\nThis particular time it was a bit more of an involved update so I turned into the office to complete the work just to make sure nothing bad happened (I got paid extra, I didn't mind).\n\nI get everything ready to go and start installing updates, keeping an eye on our servers to make sure no one jumps on, every now and again people do (as expected) but I send them a friendly message and they get off.\n\nU1 didn't do this. I kicked him off around 10 times after sending him a message through terminal services but still he kept coming back, I sent him one last message basically saying I'm locking your account, please stop trying to get on until &lt;time I said you can&gt;\n\nMy phone rings...\n\n&gt;U1: D, I'm trying to do some work but I kept getting kicked off and now can't get on at all, it says my account is locked.\n\n&gt;D: That's right...that was me.\n\n&gt;U1: Why?! I need to catch up on some work! Unlock it!\n\n&gt;D: We are doing scheduled maintenance on the infrastructure this weekend, we've sent you a couple of emails through the week to tell you access will be limited to your emails only.\n\n&gt;U1: *silence*\n\n&gt;D: You won't be able to get back on until around 4pm this afternoon.\n\n&gt;U1: Fine! I guess I'll just wait then.\n\n&gt;D: *holding back the anger* It has been scheduled for a while, apologies but we will make sure it's back for 4pm. Try then.\n\nU1 then hangs up and I carry on with my work. \n\nA few hours pass and I hear the door next to our server room open, I was by myself and locked the main door to the office behind me for obvious reasons so knew whoever it was had a key (unless I was about to star in my own slasher film)\n\nI pop my head out the door and see U2 walking past.\n\n&gt;D: Hey U2, how's it going?\n\n&gt;U2: Oh hey D, wasn't expecting to see you here.\n\n&gt;D: *oh crap* Yeah...I'm doing maintenance, most things are offline...I sent emails around.\n\n&gt;U2: Oh you are? I don't think I need to use the system for what I need.\n\n&gt;D: Oh ok...\n\nHe walks off, I run the IT of a law firm and the solicitors can record their letters for their secretaries to type out for them, I expected this is what he was going to do in his spare time. I carry on, hoping for no more interruptions.\n\n&gt;U2: D! I can't get on the system!\n\nI headbutt the server rack, it was too much for a face palm.\n\nI go out and see U2.\n\n&gt;D: ...I did say, you won't be able to use the system except emails.\n\n&gt;U2: Why does that apply to this though!\n\n&gt;D: Because that runs on the server that is currently rebooting...\n\n&gt;U2: That's ridiculous! Downtime shouldn't apply to me. I have important work to do.\n\nHe's a director which maybe explains his language? Not a very technically able director at the same time.\n\n&gt;D: I'm sorry but there is nothing I can do, the system is rebooting, it will be back soon but then I've still got about an hours work to finish up.\n\n&gt;U2: An hour! Well what can I do then?!\n\n&gt;D: Like I said in my two emails during the week, you'll only be able to access your emails and anything that doesn't need the main system to do it. So the case management and shared documents and things are off.\n\n&gt;U2: Can you guarantee me it will be back within an hour?!\n\n&gt;D: I can't guarantee it but it should be back within an hour.\n\n&gt;U2: Fine...ring me when it's back.\n\nHe stormed off like an angry 5 year old after being told they can't have any ice cream.\n\nI finished off the rest of the maintenance without incident, luckily, otherwise there may be a dent in the server rack by now. I called U2 back, he seemed happy enough!\n\nTL:DR - Scheduled maintenance, users were aware (or should have been) two users didn't think it applied to them and tried to do work anyway. Got angry when they couldn't...",

And site-visits only happen after-hours—generally, so as not to ~~get hounded by impromptu requests~~ interrupt working employees, but also because I'm a stay-at-home parent so I tend to work evenings and weekends.\n\n**$mr:** The villain, [Moira Rose](http://www.cbc.ca/schittscreek/characters/moira-rose), Account Executive at $SmallAdAgency\n\nLike seriously. They could be sisters. If you know it, the better you can imagine her accent the more entertaining this story will be!\n\n**$adm:** The mediator, Admin Manager, Quite Competent Organizational Type at $SmallAdAgency\n\n# **Summer 2015**\n\n$mr needs a new laptop; $SmallAdAgency, being leading-edge, avant-guard, creative types, have an almost exclusively Mac ecosystem. Thus far, the only laptops in the office are MacBook Airs; However, the new one-port USB-C MacBooks have just been released—*in colour* for the first time.\n\n&gt; **$ua:** I think your requirements are pretty straight forward, I'll just get you a new MacBook Air like the others in the office?\n\n&gt; **$mr:** I *must* have one in Rose Gold.\n\n&gt; **$ua:** ... And you still want an external monitor?\n\n&gt; **$mr:** Yes.\n\n&gt; **$ua:** And your fullsize keyboard and mouse?\n\n&gt; **$mr:** Well, of course!\n\n&gt; **$ua:** OK, well thing thing about the new MacBooks is that they only have one port and it is actually a new standard, USB-C, so there isn't much that supports it yet. That means that everything you want to connect to it is going to need an adapter. Connecting more than one thing at a time is going to require extra-special adapters—there are no USB-C hubs or docks yet.\n\n&gt; **$mr with a condescending look:** Wireless *is* the way of the *future*. I *must* have a Rose Gold computer!\n\n&gt; **$ua:** Yup.\n\n# **About a Month Ago**\n\n$mr has survived mostly without incident with a single multi-purpose dongle—I have not physically seen the laptop since I set it up, since she always takes it home. Snow is on the horizon, and she heard through the grapevine that I had set up super-special, by request-only, remote server access. I can give her access, but I need to set it up on the computer, which I can only access from the office network (without resorting to something like join.me—instructions of any sort are a challenge, so it's not my first choice).\n\n&gt; **$mr:** I was chatting with $adm and they mentioned that you've devised a new way to gain remote access to our server! Can you send me the instructions? That would be super useful to me in light of tomorrow's snow storm!\n\n... I can't connect to her computer, which *is* in the office. Several trouble-shooting e-mails later, she concludes with,\n\n&gt; **$mr:** Speaking of which, when am I due for a new computer? I can't plug anything into this one and it is very frustrating! Maybe I should get the same kind as the rest of the office...\n\n&gt; **$ua:** /)_-)\n\n# **This Morning**\n\nHaving received the disappointing news that she's not scheduled for a new computer for another year or two, $mr resigns herself to the seventh level of dongle hell. Truth be told, I have a bit of a soft spot for her and, being the benevolent sort, I recommend to management that we get her a dock, since they are now actually available. I bring it in and set it up after hours as is my habit—of course, her laptop is with her so I can't test it out. And it's the only laptop in the office with USB-C, so I can't borrow on to test it. *But* it came with both a USB-C and a regular USB connector, so I borrow someone else's laptop, connect the USB, confirm it's working, swap the connectors, carefully lay the USB-C cable back down where her dongle usually lays and send her a \"surprise!\" e-mail.\n\n&gt; **$ua:** I set up a dock for you! I will give you more flexibility with regards to ports. I wasn't able to test it, but you should just be able to plug it in and everything should work! Let me know if you have any problems. I left your old dongle there in case there any problems.\n\n&gt; **$mr:** Unfortunately, it doesn't work. It's the wrong size! Perhaps, I should personally buy this computer and we should look into purchasing one for me that is like the others in the office!\n\n&gt; **$ua:** What do you mean it's the wrong size? It's specifically designed for your computer.\n\n&gt; **$mr:** I mean that the docking station does not have the appropriately sized hole to plug my computer into! It's not a standardized size!\n\n&gt; **$ua, now copying $adm:** ... The dock came with a different connector cable that I *did* use to test it. I am sure that I swapped them out before I left, but I guess it is conceivable that I did not. If that's the case, the correct cable is just $preciseLocation.\n\n&gt; **$mr:** Outlook won't connect at all and I can't download my e-mails!\n\n&gt; **$adm:** I can't get her Outlook to connect at all. I don't have today to fiddle with her cables—she's pulled them all and gone back to her dongle so I don't even know what you had going on.\n\n&gt; **$ua:** /)_-)  Can you leave your laptop in the office tonight, please?\n\n&gt; **$mr:** Currently, it's not in the realm of possibility for me to leave my laptop in the office. The amount of work that needs to be done prior to April 1st isn't easily achieved in a standard work day! Isn't it possible for you to come by during business hours?\n\n&gt; **$ua:** Not on short-notice.\n\n# **This Afternoon**\n\nI remote desktop to her machine and fix her Outlook. Why, oh why does Outlook exist? And why, oh why is it the one piece software that the technically illiterate cling to like it's a shattered bulwark in North-Atlantic shipwreck?\n\n&gt; **$ua:** The username in your account settings was set to only half of your e-mail address instead of the whole thing.\n\n&gt; **$mr:** How on god's green earth did that happen? I have not touched *anything* no my Outlook or it's settings! So bizarre!\n\n# **This Evening**\n\nI come in to look at the dock without the laptop. I figure I *must* have mistakenly left the USB connector on it instead of the USB-C. I have a toddler—this would not be the stupidest thing I have done in the last two years. I just remember swapping them! Of course, my memory has also been a little tricksy in the last couple of years so...\n\nI *had* swap them! USB-C connector sitting right there just aching to be connected to be connected and looking remarkably identical to the dongle. She managed pulled the HDMI and USB keyboard from the dock and put them back into dongle and then put the dongle back into the computer herself, but couldn't connect the dock to her computer? I put everything back into the dock, tape the dock USB-C and the dongle USB-C onto the desk with a post-it underneath reading \"put this → where → this used to go.\"\n\n&gt; **$ua:** The correct connector *was* on the dock. I've reconnected everything and put a note on your desk that should make it very clear what goes where when you come in in the morning.\n\n&gt; **$mr:** Thanks /u/UrbanAbydos. I did connect the new docking station but couldn't get my computer to recognize the monitor.\n\n&gt; **$ua:** ಠ_ಠ\n\n",

No worries intially as I'm in the middle of bumfuck nowhere and a big telco is installing the NBN network and failing to inform local providers of outages causing snafus ad many an angry customer so I'm fairly used to shitty internet. After several hours I start to get annoyed  at the outage and get working on it.\n\nHowever after doing the standard restart, reinstall and whatnot the modem couldn't find the DNS or the IP. Hmm odd. Try the backup modem. Same problem. Annoyed but assume its related to the issue above but manually input both the DNS and IP into both and try again. Nada. Wipe both modems and start from the beginning. Nope again. Get annoyed but its 11pm and I've got to be at work by 7am so tomorrow's problem it is.\n\nStart again at 4pm the next day. Same issues on both. Redo the above. Test phone line. Working. Sigh and begin the dreaded phone call to the ISP, I know they have a script to follow but 9 times out of 10 I've gotton the most harried people who don't know what they are doing. Get this wonderful guy who I'll call Tim who listens when I tell him what I've done already and believes me (wow). Gets me to plug in the home phone again to test the line (live and clean)give him access to the unsupported modem and he found out for some reason the PPP was over wireless and not over ethernet, the damn modem had scrambled its settings and I missed that one. He found out in less than 15 minutes and he tested and is checking everything because I am paying for ADSL2+ but I'm barely getting basic broadband, hence the older modem. The newer modem doesn't work if the speeds drop below a certain speeds and he was appalled at the situation. When I upgraded a few months ago everything was fine for about 6 weeks then slowly everything started getting slower and slower to the point where I had to switch back to the slower modem or I'd have constant dropouts.\n\nWhen the rate survey comes through he's getting a great score unlike that lady who told me my phone can call itself and complete the call and called me a liar when I disputed it.

        "text": "LTL, FTP. Oh, please forigve my grammar or spelling mistakes since I'm not a native English speaker.\n\t\nA little background: I graduted from college in 2010 and worked in a comapany selling digital products and repair service. I worked in one of its stores mainly as the repair guy.\n\nOne day, the owner of a little restaurant near our store came with a *FPhone* (as FruitPhone). At that time, *FPhone* 4 just released, and was rather expensive. He is in his fifties, and very nice.  We often had lunches in his restaurant. Some days ago, he told us proudly he had a *FPhone* at last! His family travelled abroad and bought it as a present for him. So obviously, he needed some help now.\n\nHe handed the *FPhone* to me, said it was running slowly and having some bugs. I found the root of problem just by looking at the screen carefully: it was a cheap fake one. The UI was rather coarse, icons edge even blurring out. Now I got a problem: I didn't know how to deal this kind of situation properly at that time. I just said:\"I'm sorry, but we cannot deal with it……\" \"But why ?\" \"Because it's not a real *FPhone*.\" As soon as I said this sentence, I could feel something seriously happened in Owner's heart. \"How can it be ?\" He said in worry. \"You can see the system info...\" I went to Settings and found the \"real\" system info and showed him. He may be not so tech-savvy, but obviously he knew it was not good.I tried to comfort him, feeling very bad for both myself and him. \"Don't worry. Maybe you need a system update, maybe you got some hardware problems. I advise you go to [ourcomany] headquarter or [FruitCompany]Center for a more check.\" \n\nI left the store shortly after this incident because I got a new job offer, and have never seen the Owner again. But I still remember the complicated expression on the Owner's face that day he left store. Maybe his family cheated him, maybe his family were also victims. I have no idea. But lack of communication skill has been a stone in my heart, and I'm still trying to overcome it.",

One test involves a complex scenario that should result in an e-mail going to specific people as an alert.\n\nOne person brought to my attention that they ran the program which should generate the e-mail, and it didn't work -- no e-mail was sent. I mentioned that we knew there was a change to make to the environment on the local computer (for testing, you ran some programs locally instead of on a server) so that it knew how to send e-mail through a local mail server.\n\nBut, an hour later, the question was back. The e-mail might not be happening because there were these other users with a certain flag on their accounts. I pointed out that such a flag shouldn't be attended to by the program in question...and to go fix the e-mail thing I mentioned before.\n\nLater still, another pair of accounts was involved. Surely, these were the cause, because they would have gotten the e-mail, so it never went to our test account! No, I pointed out again, you have to fix your local environment so that it know how to send e-mail. Did you fix that yet? No? OK, go do that.\n\nSo I'm waiting to see if I get another question about another possibility they've tried before fixing the local environment.\n",

        "text": "tl;dr:  App Developer decides to reinvent the wheel, badly, killing server in the process.\n\nHere's why the Newb missed lunch today:\n\nWe spend lots of money on an enterprise monitoring product. Call it $OpenSpew, since unless you spend lots more time and money it spews alerts on things you don't care about.  It's integrated into our trouble ticketing system.\n\nAn incident manager IMs me.  They are essentially help desk operators who triage.  She's got a High Priority Incident:  \"Node XYZ is not Responding.  It is Probably Down\".  It's high priority because XYZ runs the call center software and database for one of our divisions in one of our favorite countries.  It's their night, but they're be back online in a few hours, expecting to ~~enter their own personal hell~~ take incoming calls.\n\n(*An aside:  I understand why they call it the Hell Desk.  Either you're on the front lines, and speak to users, or you become an incident manager, and stomp on fires all day.  Thanks guys, you're worth your weight in gold*).\n\nI grab the ticket, and start my checklist.  Hmm, ping works, no packet loss.  SSH works, but takes a little longer after connection to log in.  Hit uptime:\n\n    [root@XYZ /]# uptime\n    18:04:52 up 50 days, 17:37,  1 user,  load average: 752.64, 744.72, 723.48\n\nYeah, that might do it.  Reach into my bag of tricks: \"Processes per User\".\n\n    [root@XYZ /]# ps -ef | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort -bdf | uniq -c\n      1 dbus\n     10 hpsmh\n      1 ntp\n     16 postgres\n    1313 root\n      1 smmsp\n    1604 Crappy_App\n\nA quick check:  the root processes are CROND.  The Crappy_App processes are \"Monitor1.sh\" and \"Monitor2.sh\".  So, Crappy_App runs a cron process, and it hangs.  Checking crontab, I see App Developer is running Monitor1 and Monitor2 **EVERY FREAKING MINUTE**.  Reading Monitor1.sh and Monitor2.sh, I notice two things:  they collect essentially the same information with minor formatting differences; and, there is a typo in the scripts so the only output is an error message.\n\nThink about it:  2880 times a day, this script runs, and outputs an error message.  The error message gets mailed to App Dev's local account.  Because of the error, it also gets mailed to root's local account.  \n\nIt gets better:  The script has been broken for over a year.  For at least the last 400 days, the email has gone out.  Both root and App Dev's mailbox is over 300 MB, something like 1.2 million messages.  So App Dev **never logs into this box**.  Even if it generated useful data, App Dev **would never see it**.\n\nIt gets still better:  The script copies the data to a NAS archive directory.  Something has glitched in the last 12 hours, so accessing the directory hangs.  That explains a few hundred of the 1604 Crappy_App processes that will not die.  From the system logs the glitch resolved itself in about an hour, so it was probably network or NAS maintenance.\n\nAnd:  After the 40^th or 50^th hung process, sendmail decided the system was too busy, and stopped accepting new emails.   The cron job hangs trying to mail that (&amp;*#$# error message.  That's why there are  1000+ CROND and 1000+ Crappy_App processes that will not die.\n\nThe Kicker:  All of the information the developer is trying to collect is already being collected.  $OpenSpew Performance Mangler is collecting the system performance data, and $OpenSpew is watching the same things the script is monitoring.\n\nIn essence, App Developer runs two scripts a minute to get data that's already being collected, is being ignored, and uses a process that breaks the system if an error occurs.\n\nIt's pitchforks and torches time, my friends.\n\n*By the way, it was only luck that we found this before the system died completely.  When the load average got high enough, the server couldn't respond to the \"Are You There?\" query $OpenSpew sent to the local $OpenSpew agent.*\n\n ",

Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**\n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\n**$Selben:** Me! Technical team lead, previously Tier II ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company. A very skeleton-crew helpdesk with 10 of us total providing 24-hour coverage, not including supervisors, to support 2500+ company-wide.\n\n \n\n**$Peers:** Random Tier 1 and Tier 2 techs.\n\n \n\n**$User:** Your everyday user, someone from one of the company locations.\n\n \n\n**$Snickers:** My cubicle mate, also a Technical team lead, previously Tier II.\n\n \n\n**$Focus:** One of our IT Supervisors - She had a heavy programming background - She went back to her old team for some time after not doing so well as a lead, but was brought back after going through some more brainwash… er, additional ‘leadership training’.\n\n \n\n**$HR:** HR minion, the nameless faceless monsters…HR people.\n\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n \n\nThe only thing better than a free lunch is a free lunch with no strings attached. Unfortunately, this was not one of those lunches. $Snickers, $Selben, $Focus, and $HR were re-working the technician / employee grading system (*Scorecards*) as some people had been exploiting the old system. This wasn’t the first time, or last, that they would be having multiple all day meetings like this. $Focus kept track of their progress on a white-board, written in a typical bug bashing fashion complete with diagrams and arrows. While effective, it was terribly boring and took long amounts of time. Munching on their free sub sandwiches, $Snickers and $Selben were content.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter a couple weeks of testing, they seemed to have a functioning system and put it in place. Scorecards seemed to better reflect how the techs and other employees performed on a normal basis.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\n$Selben and $Snickers returned to their normal duties, and once again had scorecards themselves. $Snickers was one of the first to get his new review with $Focus. He returned triumphantly and announced to $Selben he was a “9.4 out of 10. I’m the best tech!” They both had a chuckle and $Selben continued working with a troublesome user who just couldn’t remember the name of his first car…\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; $Selben: Okay… What was your first car?\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: I don’t know!\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: What high school did you graduate from?\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: Meril.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: That doesn’t work, was it Meril High School? Do you remember what you wrote?\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: Uh… Just Meril!\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: I said that… Okay… Let’s try this one, what is your eye color?\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: Are you coming onto me?!\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: …\n\n \n\n$Selben pondered for a moment.\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Can I confirm your employee number #1234?\n\n \n\n&gt; $User: No, it’s #5712\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Okay, no problem. Let’s try this again, my apologies.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nThe user had given his name, which was the same as a different employee. With the employee number, $Selben was able to ask the correct security questions and reset their password. Finished, $Selben was about to ask $Snickers if he was ready for lunch, but a meeting invite with $HR popped up on $Selben’s screen.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; $Selben: After my review, burgers?\n\n \n\n&gt; $Snickers: Burgers… The place on 3rd?! Mmm… (*Snickers leaned back in his chair with eyes glazed over and he might have even started drooling a bit.*)\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\n $Selben headed over to $Focus’ office for his own scorecard review. $Focus and a member of $HR greeted him as he sat down. $Focus tried her best to be ‘professional’ and handed $Selben his scorecard… 4.3 out of 10?!\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; $Selben: What the %&amp;#?!\n\n \n\n&gt; $HR / $Focus: Language!\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Sorry. But… huh?\n\n \n\n$Focus started digging through some folders.\n\n \n\n&gt; $HR: This is your scorecard. Please sign below to accept your score. Should you have any questions—\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: Something’s not right, let me see the data.\n\n \n\n&gt; $HR: That information is confidential!\n\n \n\n&gt; $Focus: He may have a point, $HR. None of his old scorecards were below a 9.7.\n\n \n\n&gt; $HR: Just sign it for now and we can—\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: No. I refuse to sign until we look into the data.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nThings were tense the rest of the day. $HR had all his feathers ruffled. Apparently, they had created a magical deadline for getting the scorecards all updated and were now overdue, with $Selben holding up the whole thing.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next day, $Selben arrived to have a bleary eyed and bedraggled looking $Focus hand him his updated scorecard with a 9.8, his normal score.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; $Focus: Better?\n\n \n\n&gt; $Selben: There we go!\n\n \n\n&gt; $Focus: Looks like we’ll need to rebuild the whole project again, I figured out what went wrong.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter several hours of hassling $HR, $Focus had finally gotten the data from HR. She stayed up all night and dug through all $Selben’s reviews. Finding no issues, she ran the report again, but the same 4.3 kept coming up no matter how she ran it. She ended up getting $HR to come look over the data with her and they made the realization that $HR had built the report with employee names rather than employee numbers. This would have gone on longer without being caught if there wasn't a janitor also named $Selben who always received poor reviews. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne particular review of '*$Selben yelled at me and threatened me with a mop*' was a bit of a giveaway.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe scorecard report method they had developed gave $HR the choice to use employee numbers *or* names. $Focus, $Selben, and $Snickers ended up rebuilding it again requiring the use of employee numbers only.\n\n",

        "text": "Hello guys,\n\nI'm a german maintenance guy in a big company for buildings and working on almost everything except everything IT related (which will change in a few months because I make a second apprenticeship in a IT company) and while lots of technical things are different in IT and Building/Machine maintenance, the solutions, people/customers and storys are sometimes [very similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2tzduv/the_usual_troubleshooting/?st=jf9rv0a2&amp;sh=a9464aed).\n\nThis story happened around 6 yrs ago:\n\nI got a problem reported/ticket submitted that one of our access control machines (don't know the english word for it, it's basically a system/machine which lets only one person through at a time by using an ID Card) had some kind of problem. Most of the time its user related because they let other people through it with their card which locks the card for 30 seconds and than they stand their like idiots and submit tickets (The level of stupidity rises in this story).\n\nAfter getting to the machine and testing it with a coworker we found out that it is one of the rare real problem, the kind of IT related cardreader-not-working problem which is why someone from another company had to help us. The problem wasn't really hard but after the machine worked again we saw that one of the glass panels (which moves to the sides and gives access onto the floor) was loose and had to be fixated again.\n\nOh boy and here begins the real fun.\n\nFor your understanding and entertainment we were on the second floor which is accessible from the lobby through a staircase which is why we have the machine there in the first place. The building itself had a very easy layout like this: # (with just more lines) and every line representing a corridor. Whereever two corridors meet is a staircase and directly behind us in plain view are two elevators. The other thing to know is that fixating the glass panel meant to open the entire thing and working on it from both sides and blocking the machine because who likes to work on a moving thing.\n\nWe needed around 20-30min to fix the thing but the amount of people that wanted to go through there was amazing, even more amazing how every one of them handled it the same way:\n\n1. Going their usual way\n2. Stopping like 20 meters away because there are people working on the machine\n3. Starring at us for like 20 seconds\n4. Coming closer\n5. Still looking\n6. Coming closer and asking \"Can I get through?\"\n7. After getting the obvious answer \"no\", looking irritated and going somewhere else.\n\nI mean they can see the elevators, they can see them on the first floor, they should know that 2 meters behind that is the staircase and on top of that they can even go the other way around on the second floor with another access control machine on the other side of the floor we were working on.\n\nLuckily for us everyone of them just let us alone after that, everyone except for one very important person (who wanted to go out) which was some man in his 40s or 50s and of course very important:\n\n(I don't know much about the original conversation but it was something like this)  \n\nM - Me  \nC - Coworker  \nIP - Important Person\n\nIP: I need to get through here.  \nM: Sorry, we are atm working at the machine and can't let you through it.  \nIP (irritated and louder): I need to get through here.  \nM: Sorry we can't do that we are working here and the machine is out of order because of it.  \nIP (angry even louder): I'm very important, I need to go through here to get to my car.\nC: The machine is not working at the moment, we can't let you through here.  \nIP (still angry and finally going away)  \nC (shaking his head): Can you believe it? Some people...\n\nTechnically we could have let him through but that would be really inconvenient for us and would cost more time **than just using the elevator which is right besides him**.\n\nLucky for me he was one of like three or five unpleasant experiences I had with customers in almost 10yrs.",

Oh the joys of international corporations.\n\n\n\nEmail arrives from $RB FW: $DC has issues accessing our new solution we sold them.\n\nCool. First up, I'm only having a finger in this pie because $RB doesn't want our L1 desk having something under the nominal umbrella of our organization without an L2 escalation point (aka $Me).\n\nBut the customer doesn't know that just yet so it went down the chain rather than up. So I start a back and forth email discussion with $DC. He's nice, but frankly a bit slow off the mark. He's also got his colleague in CC for the entire chat. Fine by me.\n\nIt transpires, that some dolt in corporate sent $DC's boss the link to our solution. \n\nThe link to our solution that we use as internal users and goes through our $TRACERTid solution. Not the sanitised customer facing version.\n\nI spent about twenty minutes chasing random bodies from $solutionteam until someone gives me the right link.\n\nSo I send him $sanitisedlink. Which he can login to fine on.\n\nBut still the complaint. \"I cannot edit users or assign them to the $project.\"\n\nSo I go to the arcane support matrix document the $RB sent me at the beginning of this call just incase I needed it. Poor $DC. I hope he wasn't hired just to do this, because aside from one specific task (not the one he's asking after), we're doing it all for him.\n\nI sent him a list of what we're doing for them and what he will actually do, with his colleague still in CC + $RB in CC.\n\nI can only shake my head, and hope they didn't hire him to do all the other things they're paying us for.\n",

        "text": "It was a normal day at our MSP helpdesk. We'd all just enjoyed lunch and had heads down working hard. Some were on phones, others were in the workshop, and as ever one or two were on reddit. \n\nJust a normal sunny day in IT helpdesk land. Little did we know what horrors lay ahead. \n\nIt was a domino effect. \n\nMy colleagues on the back row of desks fell first. One by one they jumped to their feet with uncharacteristic athleticism exclaiming disgust, clutching their noses, retching and fleeing. \n\nThe confusion became palpable as the next row were overcome with the same shocking symptoms. \n\nIt didn't matter that they were in the middle of calls, a support case, or a particularity absorbing article on the rarest of Pepes - they ran, screaming, in fear, panicked from their workstations. \n\nIt was as though they were possessed. \n\nAnd then it hit me. \n\nA wall of stank like nothing I'd ever experienced awoke a primal desire within me to flee. As I sprinted for the door, weeping, the harrowing odor both confused and intrigued. Something this foul shouldn't exist. It was verging on biological warfare. *Hadn't the UN banned the use of chemical weapons?* I thought. This smell was a war crime. \n\nAnd it was too thick. This assault was too claggy and too relentless to be man-made. No flatulence, no matter how sloppy or vindaloo-fueled, could elicit such a violent reaction deep inside my lizard brain.\n\nDriven by pure instinct we ran for the door. But some stopped before reaching safety - a morbid curiosity overcoming the brave few. \n\nThe soup of stank was so thick that a distinct boundary lay between its fog of miasma and fresh, life-giving air. It was as if it resided within a bubble. Normal odors would gradually waft into existence, briefly increasing with intensity until dispersing through the surrounding atmosphere. But this was different. This terrible fragrance was sudden and extreme. It announced its existence with a punch straight to the sinuses. With one breath fresh, clean air, with the next a lung-choking quagmire of malaise. \n\nWe were IT people. We were problem solvers. We had to investigate the source, lest we burn the office to the ground to kill it.\n\nWe turned and faced the monster. \n\n---\n\nBut before we conclude this tale, an interlude for background. \n\nOur Technical Director was, to put it bluntly (pun intended for later), an idiot savant. He was an incredible coder and DB admin, but he was terrible at anything else. His heavy dependence on \"jazz cabbage\" probably had something to do with it, but he was a walking comedy of errors. \n\nMany of these errors befell his car. He was the man that crashed into the \"do not park on the grass\" sign while parking on the grass. He was the man stood in the street with a piece of bumper in his hands after unsuccessfully attempting to stop his car from rolling away after exiting with the handbrake off. He was the man that crashed the company van into a petrol pump on its first day out. \n\nSo, unsurprisingly, this man and his car were to blame for the malodorous, pestilent mist advancing through our office. \n\n---\n\nA few brave souls held clothing to noses and ventured into the fog to identify the source. Almost beyond belief, this strength of stank grew worse as they approached the workshop. \n\nThrough streaming eyes, the murderer-of-lungs was located. An innocent-looking customer laptop charger was somehow exuding the nasal rapist. \n\nAs it heated, a swampy surface infusion of something hellish activated and became airborne. The charger was unplugged, bagged and rushed to the furthest bin on the industrial estate. Windows were opened and fans activated. \n\nOnce the office became mildly habitable, we reluctantly re-entered. \n\nChecking the ticket attached to the cursed laptop charger, the guillotine of blame soon hung over our Technical Director's neck. \n\nAfter scrabbling around in his gange-addled short-term-memory, he managed to piece together a possible explanation to the mystery of the weaponized charger. \n\nA few weeks (yes weeks) back he purchased some squid from a local fish monger. Said squid was stored in the boot of his car and promptly forgotten. Only when he opened his boot to place in the picked-up customer laptop and charger did the stench hit him. He kindly elected to dispose of the squid at a mid-point between the customer location and our office. During extraction he surmised that, although squid never came into contact with the laptop, some \"run off\" from the decomposing mess may have dribbled onto the charger when the sack of mush was withdrawn from the depths of his car. \n\nSaid run off adhered to and infected the charger transformer casing. When plugged in by an innocent engineer, the transformer gently heated the fermented and aged squid slime, cooking it to generously infuse the office atmosphere with Cthulhu's very own hell-fart.\n\nTLDR: The title.

        "text": "​Happy Monday! Yay!    \nIf you're in the doldrums, hopefully this tale will help.   \nMy previous tales are [The Jar](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/75ycz9/tales_from_desktop_support_the_jar/),   \n[The Day that Email Died](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7z6o86/the_day_that_email_died/), and\n[When High security means failed audits](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/84cumw/when_high_security_means_failed_audits/)\n\n  \nI've tried to build up some anticipation for this cutover that is moving slower than a glacier at absolute zero.    \nThis story is the events observed of a mystery project involving upgrading circuits from the old metro-E lines to a new fiber optic managed service provided by a popular internet provider.      \n    \nI am a network tech, also an avid fan of cocoa, but that’s probably not important right now…    \nIn case you haven't noticed, I will use random movie/pop culture references throughout to make the story interesting and funny.   \n\nKey players, but in no particular order:       \nEng1 - We installed it, what's wrong with your equipment?       \nTech1 - Loves T1’s, can’t stand some things corporate does.    \nTech2 - probably 100 years old, way past retirement, does not use logic or come prepared.    \nBossman - Goes to meetings, handles political stuff, tells the team what to do.     \nEVP - Bossman’s boss, makes very interesting suggestions.     \nMe/Tornado- Watcher of things… in a single pane of glass.        \nAcme VP of Really Bad Ideas - self-explanatory, makes strange decisions, loves Asian food.   \n  \nAnyways, let the story begin!    \n\\*Enter Acme VP of Bad Ideas* - Orders a new circuit upgrade, doesn’t tell anyone, nor inform appropriate departments on how to handle the upgrade.  \n\nAbout 2 months later... \n  \nA circuit tech [Tech1] comes from the InternetTelephony Services and Installation Division Inc.     \nAll he does is complain how the previous installer did all of the things wrong for the a prior part of the upgrade/old Metro-E equipment removal.  \n\n&gt;Sidebar - This provider doesn't really seem to motivated to remove old equipment from the backboard/demarc point or clean it up when running in hybrid mode.\n\n$Tech also finds that the fiber is bad going to the demarc, brings crew back the next day and I assume the fiber got fixed and PRI gateway installed. \n\nIf the tech said he was installing a PRI, I would have told him where it needed to go - this is important later. \n  \nNow these Fiber circuit boxes are pretty beefy, have 16 SFP ports, and for some reason only two ports are used per circuit, very logical it is for two large boxes to run two separate circuits, one for internet, the other for SIP lines. I think someone in the food chain lied to the VP about needing more than one box.    \n\n[Me Internally] Why not program the box to do more than one thing? Just observing that it’s not much more than an layer 3 media converter. Fast forward a few weeks later, InternetTelephony calls up after an email and ~~demands~~ wants money. \n\nBossman says, for what?   \nYou haven’t completed the project!     \nThe PRI gateway is nowhere near where it needs to be!    \n\n&gt;Suddenly, A wild $ISPengineer appears!   \nENG: \"We installed it, what’s your problem?\"    \nBoss - Our demarc and phone circuits are 200 feet from where you installed it.   \nEng - Just buy media converters.  \nBoss - PRI MC’s are $400 a piece, not pair, we have 7 of them, and only 4 strands of MM fiber, you do the math Mr. Engineer.  \nEVP - Can’t we just move the telephony rack closer?    \nBoss - The equipment and associated trunk interconnects weigh a few tons, plus a forklift will not fit inside the datacenter.  \n&gt;\n\n\\*Narrator* - Now it's almost December '17.   \nOur kind, friendly, goes-the-extra mile sales rep [not really]   \nHis main email first.last@iptel.com and the secondary system one both reject inbound mail.  \n\n&gt; Sidenote, their email server was rejecting our company mail because the origin server could not be verified, how convenient with many thanks $3rdpartyspamfilter.  \n\nHe doesn’t answer the phone either.   \nBut somehow is in communication with the VP of Bad Ideas.  \nThe regional manager conference in and the rep asks Bossman a series of questions.       \nRM: So, what questions do you have?   \nBoss: Why isn’t this project getting done?    \nRM: How come you’re so confused about this upgrade we are trying to do?    \nBoss - How about I get informed from the beginning about what this project is for?\nRM: Let me call my ~~minions~~ people and see what can be done.  \n\\*intermission*   \n\nNarrator: It is now late January 2018, the cutover is still nowhere to being done and people are saying new year, new leaf, right?\nNo, it is early March and no progress has been made.  \n\nEVP- Well why is there no progress on this project?    \nBoss - ISP won't finish the job!  (He calls the ISP to encourage them to get back to work)  \nWith a splash, another installer appears! [$Tech2]   \n$T2 - I'm here to convert your backup internet connection from copper to optical.  \n\\*Me internally* You're about 3 months overdue.   \n\\*Me externally* Here's the switch in the datacenter.   \n   \n$T2 - Now, I am only allowed to put in SC connectors as directed by the NOC.    \nMe- Dude, we are trying to get away from SC \\*motions to old MetroE box still active on the wall*   \nDo you want Bossman to tell you that we will not accept SC?   \n  \nMe: \\*I go ask Boss if we let them continue to mess it up or \"encourage\" the installer to see the light?*   \n$T2 calls his boss...    \n$Boss2 says do whatever is needed to satisfy the customer.  \nYay! We get LC connectors!\n\nTech2 - I'll go out to my truck and see if I've got any cables...   \n$Me - 20 minutes later, hey bossman? I think we lost our installer...    \n \nA webdev finds him wandering in the back of the building, the computer room is here, bro how old are you again?  \n\nHe fiddles and fawns around  trying to patch in the connection, and finally bossman says here, just use one of our spares, \\*Hands over LC cable*\n\nYou are now caught up, I have no idea what, when, where, or how part 2 will come about, but it will come... slowly.

        "text": "I work in an IT-adjacent capacity. Since our company's contracted IT support is relegated to a whole other floor, a whole 1.5 minute elevator ride (or instantaneous phone call) away, and because my work also involves an above-end-user level of computational knowledge, people just contact me. \n\nNormally, I just refer the problem $user to the IT guy downstairs, but as he was offsite when I took this particular call, I decided to see if I could help. My mind is broken now, and I wish I hadn't.\n\nThe parties involved:\n\n**me** - yours truly\n\n**Oblivious Cranky Lady (OCL)** - Nice enough, as long as everything in the universe is aligned. Otherwise, just a pain.\n\nOCL contacted me via Skype message. This is the exchange:\n\n\n\n**OCL**: I can't get any of my programs.\n\n**me**: Good morning. Have you restarted your machine? (She never logs out, just locks her screen. After a nuclear war, cockroaches and her login will still be here.)\n\n**OCL**: OK. I will restart. (20 seconds later, not having gone offline) OK. It still didn't work. Please help NOW.\n\n**me**: OK I will go over there in a few minutes.\n\n**OCL**: OK, Please come NOW.\n\n**me**: (sighing loudly) On my way.\n\n\n\n\nI get to her desk, and I see her laptop in its dock, and one of her two monitors is obviously near death. Unless you look at it closely, it looks like it's powered off. Just barely, you can see her windows taskbar and her whole main desktop.\n\nThe monitor is buzzing off and on, and occasionally flickering. \n\nI undock the laptop and proceed to set her desktop to be able to use the laptop screen as a secondary monitor with the other, good monitor.\n\n\n\n**OCL**: That won't work. I already told you I restarted it several times.\n\n**me**: (look of disbelief that someone in charge of important stuff doesn't realize that undocking a laptop isn't the same as rebooting it) You'll need a new monitor. I will order you one and tell IT Guy to get it to you ASAP.\n\n**OCL**: I can't order it myself?\n\n**me**: No, please let me do it on your behalf. (anticipating the complete garbage fire that service call would likely become)\n\n**OCL**: (Strangely defeated) .....ok.  Well, get going, then.\n\n\n\nAt this point I just walked off. I placed the call and sent an message to IT Guy to be on the lookout (for the service ticket as well as the user.)\n\nTL;DR: Non-IT personnel gets his own fair share of end user frustration.\n\n\n",

        "text": "A couple years ago, my office got acquired. NewCompany was a bit more frugal (see: deliberate) than OldCompany. OldCompany's policy was \"all the best for everyone.\"\n\nThis became obvious a few months ago when the OldCompany's lease on a certain printer expired. It was absolutely representative of OldCompany's policy of 'the best money can buy': a $30,000 printer that was totally overkill for the few thousand pages the location printed per month.\n\nNewCompany decided it was overkill and would replace it with a device that didn't cost four figures to maintain. It was not a rushed process: we mentioned it in our monthly meeting, we sent out an email, and even posted a bulletin asking for feedback ON the printer itself. Eventually, we found a suitable replacement and, again, sent out an email to the office letting them know that the printer would be removed and replaced on March 1st.\n\n**Three weeks after we removed the printer**, cue phonecall:\n\n&gt; $ luser: WHY ISN'T THE PRINTER WORKING. YOU BROKE IT. FIX IT.\n\n&gt; $ IT: Huh. Well, apologies. I thought everything was going pretty smoothly. Let's take a look.\n\n&gt; $ luser: Well, you'd better. It was working fine yesterday.\n\n*IT remotes in and sees that the $luser is trying to print to OverkillPrinter that hasn't been in the office in three weeks. That's weird... Why hasn't group policy or autotask pushed out the update? Oh, because there's been no trust relationship for... a month? This user hasn't stepped foot inside our domain for a MONTH? Yep, last badge-in was 30+ days ago.* \n\n&gt; $IT: Wait, you said this was working fine yesterday. Did you check on the printer and see if it needed paper or anything?\n\n&gt; $luser: Of course I did! It printed just fine!\n\n&gt; $IT: That's surprising, considering that printer hasn't been in the building for *three weeks*. Also, neither has your laptop. Why are you printing to a location you haven't been in for a month?\n\nThis may surprise you, but $luser was lying. Turns out that when the company was acquired, $luser was assigned to a new team based a thousand miles away. Since user had no supervision, user just stopped showing up.\n\nIT asked Supervisor to have their employees step foot in the office at least once a month for group policy reasons... to which Supervisor responded \"all of my employees are in the office, every day, unless there are exceptional circumstances...\"\n\nTL;DR: User realizes no one is holding them accountable, proceeds to *stop coming to work* and then gets mad when they're behind on the big office gossip. Also, now everyone is required to put a \"Working From Home, Expected Return Date: []\" on their workstation when absent.",

        "text": "Long time reader, first time poster, let's get into the living hell my morning just became.\n\nLet's face it, we've all faced a situation before where we've had to help the kindly old lady/man who just won't interface with technology.\n\nSometimes it's fine.\n\nSometimes it's anger inducing.\n\nBut almost every time there's at least some frustration that this person doesn't get or understand what comes second nature to us.\n\nBut wait, let's rewind for some context.\n\nA little over 2 years ago I started my journey down working in IT by being hired on to the IT team of the company I was working in a call center of. It's a nice little 2 man team, my boss and myself, working a load and a half of hours but meeting all the company's needs in the meantime. However when I started, our services were being contracted out to a company that did related work in the office right next door. \n\nOccasionally a printer issue would show up. Or a network outage I'd have to go into their tiny networking closet and slap something into... pretty relaxing work. But then enter in Lovely old Lady, or *LoL* for short. She did payroll for their company and was always having issues. My boss, who has little patience for people who won't learn, appointed me her designated IT person to save himself the misery.\n\n&gt; LoL: Sylpheed, my computer has updated and I don't know where any of my shortcuts are. Come help!\n\n&gt;LoL: Sylpheed, I can't get this Excel spreadsheet to look the way I want it to, can you come over here when you've got some time and fix it for me?\n\n&gt;LoL: Sylpheed! I'm not getting any emails any more! Come help! (She'd changed the email list to Alphabetical that time.)\n\nEvery time I'd slap on a smile, walk to the next building and help her out. Now don't get me wrong, I never minded doing these things to help... I actually enjoy helping non-tech-savvy people with their issues. But I do juggle quite a bit with my job (being put in charge of everything my boss doesn't want to do, certainly can't blame him there.) and every time I'd go help her out equated to time I'd have to crunch the rest of my day's work down into in order to finish everything on schedule.\n\n&gt; After a few months of me solving all her problems and my boss giving her my number (The both of us are always on call, we get paid hourly for it) she started calling me \"Best Friend\". \n\nSo about 6-8 months ago when LoL's boss closed down their office (turns out the guy was a massive crook) I breathed a sigh of relief as I'd never have to go help help my Best Friend with an excel spreadsheet, miss-clicked link, or printer issue.\n\nCue this morning, I'm running the daily reports like usual, chatting via IM with some colleagues in another building sipping my morning tea... and I hear a disturbance I'd not felt since...\n\n&gt;LoL: Hey there Best Friend!\n\nManagement decided to hire her and stick her in the office literally one door away from me. Please... put me out of my misery.",

        "text": "Hey again, TFTS! I've got another story for you, which I was reminded of after seeing a post in /r/techsupportgore about a painted-over parallel wall jack. I'll get to the significance of that in a moment. \n\nBut first, in case you guys want to read my other stories, you can check out [this one about that time one of my execs had me block one of his employees from doing her job] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7yiih8/fwd_i_need_you_to_stop_my_employee_from_working/), or [this one about that time I upgraded some of my users to Windows 7 via late-night abductions] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ypxhl/windows_xp_and_old_pos_software_vs_my_boss/), or [this one about the time I poisoned a user] (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5gujya/you_poisoned_my_keyboard/). But all of those stories occurred during my first job after college. The story I have for you tonight is a little older- it's from back when I was a student technician at my university's IT helpdesk.\n\nSo, my school had a number of historic buildings on its campus which were seldom and slowly renovated. No doubt this was partially due to the expense and care required to do such work on century-old structures, but I insist that it was also partially due to the people that occupied these buildings. Many of them deeply disliked any kind of changes, you see. \n\nAs a result of these things, some of the buildings had undergone patchwork upgrades and had visible signs of antiquated tech. Such signs included overhead and slide projectors (still in use), desks with large alcoves meant to house monitors the size of microwaves, and (in this case) parallel wall jacks for printers.\n\nThe building that housed our Economics department sported all of these things, along with a staff that had, over years, distilled their own special vintage of crazy. In one corner of this building, surrounded by three faculty offices, there was a tiny little teacher's lounge. It was nothing much, just a room that was probably originally a large closet. The door had been removed and a countertop had been installed inside to accommodate a coffeemaker, an electric kettle, and a microwave. Now, as a freshman, I didn't even know this room existed, but for the following three years, I would know this room well and dread it deeply.\n\nEnter me, during my sophomore year, manning the phones at the student helpdesk.\n\nPhone: Ring Ring.\n\nMe: University Helpdesk, Rathwood speaking. How may I help you?\n\nProf A: Yes hello this is Professor A. It's doing it again.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, sir?\n\nProf A: Oh. Are you new?\n\nMe: Kinda... A little. Yeah, I guess... sorry.\n\nProf A: Is Older Student Tech (OST) there?\n\nMe: Yeah... Should I put him on?\n\nProf A: Tell him my printer's broken. He'll know what to do.\n\nMe: Okay. Bye.\n\nMe: Hey OST!\n\nOST: Wha?\n\nMe: Prof A just called, he said-\n\nOST: Printer's down, right?\n\nMe: ...yeah\n\nOST: Don't worry about it. Give it 5 minutes. Either he'll call back and say it's working now, or you'll get a call from Prof B or Prof C. Let me kn-\n\nPhone: Ring Ring.\n\nMe: (glancing at the display) It's Prof B.\n\nOST: Okay. Yep. Tell her we're on our way.\n\nI answered Prof B's call, and sure enough, she's having printer issues too. I tell her a tech is en route, and then just as I hang up, OST taps me on the shoulder.\n\nOST: Come on. You're gonna need to see this.\n\nI follow OST across campus to the Economics building and we weave our way through the halls back past the offices of Professors A, B, and C to the secluded teacher's lounge. OST pulls the microwave forward and reaches behind it to retrieve a stained gray box caked in dust and attached to a huge knot of cables.\n\nOST: This is a JetDirect box. The printers in the next three offices are connected to it and it breaks about once or twice a month. You'll know it's broken when Professors A, B, and C all can't print. When that happens, you gotta come down here and reset this thing. Just unplug it, give it 30 seconds, and plug it back in.\n\nOST demonstrated as he spoke, and then stuffed the JetDirect box back behind the microwave and pushed it back into place.\n\nOST: Sometimes the cables get knocked loose too, so check that out. There should be three parallel cables coming from the box to each of those 3 wall jacks, and the box should have a ethernet cable connected too.\n\nWe stepped out of the lounge and poked our heads into Prof A's office. \n\nIn it, a yellowed 15-year-old (at the time) printer chugged away, spitting out stacks of paper for an eagerly awaiting Prof A.\n\nOST: All good, Prof A?\n\nProf A: Yep. Thanks, OST.\n\nAs we left, I turned to OST.\n\nMe: Wow. We need to get that guy a new printer. Something with a network card that wasn't built by a blacksmith.\n\nOST said nothing, but smirked.\n\nMe: Seriously, what does that thing run on, steam? I'm surprised he calls us when it breaks instead of giving it a smack with a monkey wrench like an old tractor.\n\nOST: He won't take a new printer.\n\nMe: What?\n\nOST: Boss has been trying to get him to take one for years. He refuses it every time. So do professors B and C. They like their old printers. And since Prof B is department head, it's hard to make them take new hardware.\n\nMe: But he had a new laptop...\n\nOST: Yeah, we forced him to take that last year when we upgraded all the faculty to Windows 7 laptops. He actually skipped XP- his old machine ran Windows 98. Boss had to meet with the whole department and explain why keeping Windows 98 was a security risk.\n\nMe: Oh. So what's up with that weird setup?\n\nOST: I think that room was a server closet a few years ago and those offices were one big workroom. Boss said something about a round of renovations like 10 years ago. I'm guessing the Econ department bought those printers, so they hung on to them when the workroom turned into offices.\n\nMe: Still? That's cheap. And weird.\n\nOST: I dunno what to tell you, man. It's the Econ department.\n\nSo for three solid years, I routinely reset that JetDirect Box, wanting to OfficeSpace that whole setup with every fiber of my being every time I had to go down there.\n\nAnd then one day... I graduated and never had to deal with it again.\n\nEdit: I learned something about kettles and teapots today, thanks to /u/vladdy463 and /u/hankmarducasII. The story has been updated to reflect my new knowledge.",

        "text": "TL;DR: HR Manager's request requires prior planning, of which there is none.\n\n\nI'm at my desk some idle Thursday afternoon here at $DangNerdGriefCompany, catching up on Reddit and contemplating my weekend plans (drinking and debauchery, which means Diet Coke and some Tarentino movies).  My email chimes and a help desk request ticket pops up from $HRManager.\n\n\"Setup $NewSalesPerson account. Will need laptop configured for California office. $NewSalesPerson start date is Monday, [CurrentDay+4]\"\n\nWhaa?  We have a small (very small) office in California that has a couple sales guys in it. I didn't know we were even contemplating *hiring* for a $NewSalesPerson, so consequently we don't have anything pre-positioned in California for a salesperson, never mind not even having hardware sitting on the shelf that is suitable to send to Cali on a one working day notice kind of situation.\n\nI pick up the phone and call $HRManager.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Got your help desk ticket for $NewSalesPerson in California. The answer is 'no'.\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"What? Why not?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Because I don't have any computers currently laying around that are suitable to to send to a new remote employee. Especially not a sales person.\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"But you can get him a *new* computer, right?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Sure, as long as we have the budget for it.\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"I'm pretty sure they have money in the budget for that. And it will be there on Monday all set for him to use?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Who do I look like? Chuck Norris? No. He'll be lucky to have it by the *following* Monday, [CurrenyDay+11] if all the stars line up.\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"So he's just supposed to sit around and do nothing for a week?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Well, bascially, yeah. How long have we known this guy was going to start on Monday?\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"He just accepted the position about 20 minutes ago.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Let me rephrase: How long have you known that we've been going through the hiring process for $NewSalesPerson in the California office, and why are you giving me less that *two business days* notice that we have a new employee starting and you need new hardware?\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"He just accepted the position and he can start early.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"I guess I'm not making the practical realities of the physics of IT and business clear. You've been seeking to hire $NewSalesPerson for the California office for some period of time, certainly longer than just this morning, right?\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"Well, yeah.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"And whomever took the position was going to need a computer, email account, that sort of thing, right?\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"Uh huh.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"So, no matter who *actually* took the position, we were going to need to get this person a computer, at a minimum.\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"But he just accepted the position...\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"You were going to continue looking for this position until you hired it, right?\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"Sure.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"We were eventually going to need a computer, new or otherwise, for *some* $NewSalesPerson in California. If not this guy on this coming Monday, it would be someone else on the following Monday, or the Monday after that, or some Monday in the next 30 days or so, right?\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"I guess.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"So what is so difficult to have the *common courtesy* of giving the IT Department a heads up that $DangNerdGriefCompany is actively looking to fill a position that is going to require us to purchase and configure hardware, or at the very least to ship hardware to California? You *know* we don't have new or even new-used hardware laying around the office. It takes a day to get a PO approved, and a day to order the hardware, then a few days, mostly because $DangNerdGriefCompany is too cheap to pay for overnight shipping, to receive that hardware. I can turn most new systems around in a about a day, but then its still another number of days to ship the equipment to California. I can't change that timeline by very much.  But if $HR, and in this case $NoSalesVP, would actually have a conversation with $Me about an open position's expected tech needs BEFORE we started hiring for the position, we wouldn't have to have this conversation nearly **EVERY TIME** you submit a request to setup up a new hire.\"\n\n&gt;$HRManager: \"I guess I see what you mean.\"\n\n(Original title was \"A Time Machine, a Crystal Ball and the Concorde All Walk Into My Office\")",

There's no presentation of cast, because I believe in descriptive variable names.\n\n\n$Sales told me at 5pm one day \"Tomorrow morning we're setting up $MajorNewClient with $feature, so could you prepare that and be here at 8am\". I was like \"what $feature, we don't have that, it's never been mentioned before, we need hardware, software, license for that\". They were like \"Uhh but the client said they couldn't use our service without that, so we put it in the contract.\"\n\n\nEverything concerning $MajorNewClient had run smoothly up to this point, and we had invested considerable upfront costs (something like USD 70k) that would bite us if the client canceled because our service did not conform to the contract $Sales had signed -- not to mention industry reputation and the fact that $MajorNewClient was correct, this $feature was really important for biggish clients. This was our second really big client, five times bigger than any other client save one. That one, our first big client, was twenty times as big but did not need $feature because they were so big they provided it themselves, and so we'd let $feature slide while we were busy signing small clients.\n\n\nI ginnied up a temporary solution using opensource, an ancient server that we had just decommissioned but which happened to have the right hardware and was already connected to the right places in the network, and some 500 lines of bash-fu. I finished at 6 am, ate breakfast, presented to the client over telephone, everything worked, and then crashed for the rest of the day.\n\n\nI never got around to correcting the problem that adding a new client caused a ten-second interruption of service to *all* of the clients, but eight years later when I left the company that server had a failover hot backup with the same night-written scripts and was serving a substantial portion of our userbase.\n\n\nTL;DR: Sales adds a customer-requested feature to a binding sales contract but doesn't think to inform the guy who has to provide the feature, leading to a last-minute hacking feat to save the company.",

        "text": "On again off again lurker here.  I don't get too many TFTS stories in my line of work as I'm a POS field tech and most of my customers are happy to see me and stay out of my way.  My stories generally come from the other POS personnel I encounter and this one had to be shared.\n\nA long story for a simple issue so you can share my confusion followed by disbelief followed by a deep sadness and disappointment.\n\nMy coworker and I had to add a new scale to a department of a grocery store.  This sits on top of a case in which the goods are displayed and the scale is then used to weigh the goods and print a label.  In order to receive updates this scale must be on the network and is therefore plugged into a network jack and a power outlet, both located directly below and to the side of the scale.\n\nFirst, keep in mind that my coworker ($Tech1) and I ($Tech2) did not install the cabling at this store.  Neither of us have ever opened one of these cases so we don't know how it's cabled.\n\nSo my coworker and I install the scale and plug it in.  It has power but no network.  Commence troubleshooting.  We look behind the RJ45 jacks, there's a grey Cat5 cable behind each one.  We look under the case, a blue Cat5 cable going into a conduit.  Well there's your problem there's no home run.\n\n&gt;$Tech1: The new scale's network port just flashed.\n\n&gt;$Tech2: Wait what?  But it's not cabled.  Is it?\n\nOkay, let's find where grey and blue cables meet.  (further investigation)\n\nBy now we have the access panels off the case.  There's a simple bix panel inside.  The idea is simple, blue cables come from the network rack and get punched to one side, grey cables get punched to the other side, network jacks work.  Easy, right?  Apparently not.\n\nSo the blue cable comes from under the case and is punched into the front of the bix panel.  Next to it on the front is a grey cable.  Next to it is another grey cable.  Flip the panel over.  On the other side are individual pairs from a Cat5 cable serving as jumpers from the pairs on the blue cable to the first grey cable.  Then another set of wires used as jumpers from the first grey cable to the second grey cable.  I just stared at it for a minute.  My brain didn't know what to do.  This is the most basic thing.  You can't splice/patch two Cat5 runs into one and expect both to work.  Windmills do not work that way!\n\n[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/ybBBI) in case you need the visual.\n\nI'll keep the solution short.  The obvious thing to do is pull in another run and patch this properly.  In an unrelated incident the conduit this run goes through got crushed and filled with concrete so that's out.  I just cut the home run, terminated it, patched to a small switch, ran two new runs to the bix panel, punched them properly and terminated them, patched to the panel, all good.\n\nWhy is this my problem?  In POS, everything is your problem.\n\nThanks guys.  Keep doing what you do.",
