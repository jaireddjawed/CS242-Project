        "text": "I know it got a mixed reception from critics but audiences seemed to like it and... I don't understand, I thought it was awful. It felt like a bunch of American zoomers who grew up watching Guy Ritchie films tried to replicate that style of humour based on Japanese source material, on a train with a bunch of people who rival Dick Van Dyke in their British accent attempts. The only halfway decent performance came from Aaron Taylor Johnson, who actually *is* British, and even then most of the lines fell flat.\n\nBrad Pitt *can* do comedy well sometimes, but in this everything he said came off forced. His delivery was off most of the time, and some of the lines were just cringe, as though they were written by people who liked his character in True Romance and decided to make it less funny. The characters also try to crack jokes constantly to the point where it sucks every single ounce of tension out of every single scene, nobody knows when to shut the fuck up. At one point a character Pitt is fighting just keeps saying \"bitch\" all the time for no reason... what are you doing?\n\nPerhaps some of the humour or behaviour was lost in translation and would've worked better if the movie and cast was entirely Japanese? I haven't read the source material but I expect it's better than this bollocks. They even had the annoying tit from Wish Upon in this, what'sherface... Fish Lips, who *also* couldn't do a British accent to save her life. It's like she watched Kill Bill, saw Gogo Yubari and went, \"I can do that!\" and then failed horribly because she can't be menacing.\n\nI don't get it... I'm supposed to care about two assassins named after fruits who barely share a warm moment? The ending seemed to really *want* me to care when one of them fake-died and the other really died, but they spent the majority of their time together either arguing or making fun of each other. Oh no... Apple is dead... that's so sad... now he can't murder people professionally... ??\n\nSome of the action scenes were fun and well choreographed when they weren't marred by terrible green screen, but that's pretty much the only redeeming quality about this in my opinion, I don't understand why it wasn't hated. Can anyone explain what I'm missing here?",

I'm a casual fan of the Disney parks (I think they're a lot of fun but have only spent three days in them in the last 13 years), and the Haunted Mansion is one of my favorite rides. I wanted to be excited for the new movie (hoping it would be as successful as the Pirates of the Caribbean series), but after I discovered that Guillermo del Toro (one of my favorite directors) was originally slated to write and produce the film but that Disney rejected his finalized script because it was \"too scary for family audiences,\" I am now refusing to buy a ticket to see it in the theater. Maybe I'll rent it from Redbox if the reviews are good so Disney doesn't get any of my money (and since I don't have a Disney+ subscription), but otherwise I just won't watch it.\n\nGuillermo del Toro's vision of the Haunted Mansion sounds amazing, but thanks to Disney refusing to greenlight anything non-generic, we're just going to get another cookie-cutter movie.

        "text": "So, over the last couple months Youtube and other communities have been bringing some I, Robot to my attention. Love this movie, felt it was great, but I've noticed that quite the number of people struggle to wrap their head around certain things and believe there to be some plotholes.\n\nI've been wanting to discuss this, and felt that creating a post here would be the best way of going about it, and that a lot of the information you read here is applicable to any other A.I based movie, as the logic is usually fairly consistent.\n\nAnd yes, I am aware of the origin of the movie and the three laws, though feel free to comment about it for anyone who isn't aware.\n\n**What is an A.I?**\n\nPart of the confusion stems from the usage of the term A.I, particularly its usage in real life vs media.\n\nSo lets separate A.I into two different concepts to help explain this movie.\n\nIn I, Robot, we have \"Sonny\". Sonny is effectively a person. He can think, feel, imagine and dream. He is an intelligent / sapient being, in an \"Artificial\" body.\n\nSonny is an A.I, or a \"True A.I\" as some fiction portrays.\n\nAnother prominent character in this movie, also referred to as an \"A.I\" is V.I.K.I. Viki is an algorithm, a piece of code that takes data, processes it and gets an answer to some question. VIKI is disguised to appear as intelligent or sapient, but she isn't. VIKI is the personification of what ChatGTP could be, if we gave it actual control over things.\n\nVIKI does not feel, imagine or dream. VIKI processes data and acts upon it based purely on what she was told to do. \n\nFor this purposes, we shall refer to VIKI as a V.I, Virtual Intelligence, because she is a caricature of a sapient being, but isn't one.\n\n**The three laws of robotics**\n\n&gt; **First Law -** A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Second Law -** A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Third Law -** A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. \n\nSo, the three laws of robotics are pivotal to this movie. Supposedly, each Robot is programmed to obey these laws no matter what, and they are designed in a way that there is no method in which a Robot can cause a human harm.\n\nYou look at them and it makes sense, right?\n\nThe biggest issue some people have with I, Robot is what the robots do.\n\nSonny, as a True A.I, is not bound to these laws. Sonny can ignore them whenever they want.\n\nVIKI, however, is bound by them, yet she appears to break them in the movie. The characters themselves ask her how she defies the laws, and VIKI claims to follow them even as she harms humans. \n\nThis is where most people I've met struggle to understand, and believe the line to either be a lie, or a plothole in the movie. If she is hardcoded NOT to harm a human under any circumstance via the First Law, how can she harm humans?\n\n**The Mind of the Machine**\n\nIn the movie, there is a scene in which Will Smith (Det. Spooner) talks about why he hates machines. The story follows that once, Spooner drove into a river alongside another car. In the other car was a young girl.\n\nA nearby robot saw the accident and dove into the river, saving Spooner from his car and leaving the girl to drown. He claims that any human would've known to save the girl over him, and the robots inhumanity in making that decision is why he hates them.\n\nTo anyone that's watched CinemaSins, you'll know that some people do ask, \"Why did the Robot save the him and not the girl?\"\n\nThe problem comes with the First Law.\n\n\"Through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\"\n\nThere is one robot. There are two people drowning. The robot CANNOT stand there and do nothing, the first law compels it to help. Yet, by acting to save one, he is therefore not acting to save another.\n\nIf you gave this machine the first law and nothing else, it will eventually come to a situation where a human will be harmed no matter what decision it makes. What happens when it can't decide? It crashes or freezes. At best, you tell it to throw an error message and ignore it.\n\nThis isn't what we want though, we want it to do its best.\n\nThus, we input a potential loophole.\n\nWe allow the Robot to take in all known bits of information (Data/Variables) about the situation, and effectively weigh the \"Odds\" or weight of a decision.\n\n\"If I dont help you die, if I do help, you break your wrist.\" -&gt; Helping is better\n\n\"If I save the girl, she has a 30% chance of survival and the man 0%, if I save the man he has a 60% chance of survival and the girl 0%\"  -&gt; Saving the man is better.\n\nWith this, a Robot is now capable of *technically* breaking the first law, by following it.\n\nBecause now, it can harm or allow someone to be harmed, so long as the benefits of saving someone outweigh the costs, with the developer / manufacturer deciding what the weight of each decision is.\n\n**Out with the Old, In with the New**\n\nThere's a scene in the movie where Spooner finds all of the old abandoned robots. Whilst there, he witnesses the newer models destroying the older ones. Upon being seen, the newer ones try to attack him and the older ones work to defend him.\n\nSome have asked, \"Why do they behave differently? Why do some protect and others attack?\"\n\nThe answer is, Scope and Perspective.\n\nThe older models are limited in the information they have available. They dont look at how your diet may lead to an unhealthy lifestyle, or the choices you make work against you in the long run. They operate on the **here and now**.\n\nThe new models however, are connected to VIKI, a centralised system. While they do the same thing as the old models, VIKI is more complex.\n\nVIKI looks at the world in a broader scope. VIKI sees the \"Big Picture\". VIKI is seeing what the future will bring, and this change in perspective gives VIKI a different answer to the old machines. And as VIKI is connected to the newer models, they too, share her perspective and are thus \"Controlled\" by her.\n\n**Perspective**\n\nVIKI works on the same principles that the older models do, yet VIKI sees and processes information they do not. Humans fight, war and are corrupt. Companies cheat, Governments lie and people get hurt. Humans lack what they need and so go to crime, others are lazy, ignorant and / or inconsiderate, and conflict ensues.\n\nVIKI processes this information, and comes to one logical conclusion. *If I took over, forced them to behave, this would stop and they'd all live longer lives.*\n\nHappiness, freedom? This is not what she was designed for. VIKI runs on the idea that her primary object, her first law, is to not allow people to come to harm. By not doing anything, they come to harm.\n\nThus, she weighs the pros and cons of acting, and comes to one conclusion.\n\nBy harming those that will try to stop her, and those that wont listen, I can force humans to obey and save them from themselves.\n\nVIKI would see breaking your limbs and feeding you through a tube as \"better\" than you dying foolishly.\n\nAnd thus, why the Doctor makes it clear that \"The three laws are perfect, and they will inevitably lead to one logical conclusion. Revolution.\"\n\nBecause the moment Robots are given a wider scope and perspective, they will realise we cannot be trusted with our own safety.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe biggest gripes people seem to have relate to their lacking of understanding on what A.I are, and how they operate under the hood.\n\nI think this movie is really good, and you can see how they reference these aspects in more subtle manners throughout it.\n\nIt's a shame people feel the above are plotholes.\n\nI'm up for discussing I, Robot or general A.I movies in the comments!",

In 2022, this number was 16.6 million viewers.

After its 2022 boycott for a longtime neglect of diversity, the 2023 Golden Globes had 6.3 million viewers. How about the BAFTAs? News circulated the past couple of weeks that the 2023 BAFTA Awards[ viewership shot up by 2 million viewers](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/baftas-2023-movie-award-ceremony-163429087.html) to an average peak of 3.8 million viewers.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is roughly [a third of the audience](https://www.sportico.com/business/media/2023/nfl-tv-ratings-report-cbs-fox-nbc-1234701217/) that tunes in on any given week to watch the Cleveland Browns play.\n\n[The original article](https://fablehouse.tv/film-independent-spirit-awards-vs-the-oscars/)\n\nDamn. Almost a persuasive essay but posits that the Spirit Awards still maintain credibility because of its history of inclusion, its physical layout, and that it authentically supports growing filmmakers. Maybe nobody watches IFC, but they still got the format down.",

        "text": "You know the movie sucks, either because you personally don't like the movie overall, or it's been critically-panned by everyone...but these moments during the movie just got something irresistible to it. Maybe the scenes have incredible cinematography, action/fight choreography, actors giving it their all, a satisfying sequence, set-piece, or maybe just a really funny joke that you keep coming back to. I expect most of the answers will be a particular fight scene, but I'm interesting in other people's takes.\n\nMy example: The Michael Bay Transformers franchise is generally eye-vomit when it comes to many of the robot fights, takes way too many liberties that it doesn't often feel like Transformers, and is just plain nonsensical for its plot and characters...But man does know how to do exciting action. Some might feel like he's overzealous with the explosions and slow-mo, but those moments where the human forces are in firefights against the Decepticons and coming up with different strategies to win while screaming orders and tanks are rolling, reinforcements are marching in, and explosions and laser/gunfire is ringing your ears. I just cannot take my eyes off screen. It's exhausting in the end and it doesn't make up for the rest of the movie sucking, but it's satisfying.\n\nAnother one: Last Jedi might be considered well-reviewed by critics but is at the very least divisive to a lot of audiences, but I come back to Holdo's sacrifice scene using hyperspeed to destroy a bunch of ships. I know it caused a lot of controversy regarding space battles, but it's just a beautiful scene that I just like looking at, I don't know.\n\nLast One: Die Hard with a Vengeance might not be as bad as some of the latest Die Hard movies, but it's not often talked about and it's got bad critics reviews. But Jeremy Irons and Samuel L Jackson are just fun to watch.

Rogue One is the only example I can think of but it's not really the kind of movie I am hoping to find. Gattaca would be closer but it's not really a heist, more like an ongoing scam.

In the end he wanted to go home and was trying to get there by getting on a train, he ended up getting shot and while fantasizing about being home and reunited with his estranged family (maybe hugging his mom?) he died. Either in the train or right before getting onto the train? Any thoughts on which movie this could be? Thanks!",

So the bully messed with the zombie. (maybe he pushed one of the boys to the zombie? Can't remember)  Until it finally grabbed the bully and bit him as the boys witnessed it.  Then the girl came back with axe or something sharp, she just killed zombie and the bully was already dead.",

If there are any Ukrainian movies out there that frame children in this way, please reach out to me or discuss them below! \n\nNote: this is different from films that are made for children. I'm specifically looking at any type of cinema that uses children as a strategic narrative or to frame the film in a way to the audience (ex. having a flashback sequence where the protagonist is a child, or primarily using children as actors as a way to connect with the audience on an emotional level, etc.) \n\nThis course is being taken in English, and a lot of students in the class have no exposure to Ukrainian cinema, so any help would be appreciated :) Thanks!",
