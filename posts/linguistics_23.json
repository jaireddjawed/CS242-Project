One aspect of this involved the creation of a race and a whole system of communication for them. One member of this race is a archivist, historian, and teacher, so I have written my glossary from her perspective.  She includes in each glossary a little section on their language where she goes over the terms and phrases used in the story.\n\nIn book 2 it was very easy to know what to include, as this species was integral to the plot, so words and phrases were used throughout.  Book 3, however, has a very small amount of their influence, so there isn't a bank of used words and phrases to pull from.  I always loved learning words and phrases from other languages, so I am including some more anyway, but given the fact that I have the entirety of language to pick from, I am finding myself overwhelmed with options.  So I figure I will ask fantasy lovers and language lovers what they would like to learn. \n\nThanks for any help with this!",

        "text": "Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

Everything seems fine to me, but I have a problqem regarding my speaking which my friends noticed while I was speaking to him. The problem is that when someone asks me an unexpected question or a question that I know the answer, I start pausing a lot in places that there shouldn't be any paused. For instance, I can pause after the main verb and think about what I have to say next. This problem blocks my fluency. Sometimes, in the class when I want to talk about sth which I want to explain, my fluency breaks. I look incompetent in front of my students. \n\nI am a second year doctoral student linguistics major, and I still have this problem. To be honest, I feel frustrated. \n\nNote: this problem started when I first learned English years ago. I was just silent, and I didn't iteract with people to develop my fluency. Even in master's I had this problem. I always avoid doing presentations. In my BA, When my friends started speaking English, I stopped talking to them in the Target lge. And I had to take time to think and responde. Some of them eved mocked me by saying (he is in a silent period now).\n\n\nIs there anything to do concerning this matter?\n\nThanks a lot.\nKind regards.",

I still live in a lusophone country.\n\nBeing bilingual, it feels much harder to properly express myself to non-english speakers. I constantly think of words in English that don't have direct translations, or even ones that do, but there's a subtlety or another that the portuguese simivalent lacks, and that chokes me up trying to look for better alternatives. I almost feels like this worsens when I talk to people who do understand it when I mix in English while speaking, for it makes me lazy to think of translations for words I am certain can be translated. This has a negative effect when I feel that same laziness while talking normally. All of these things delay me as I speak.\n\nFurthermore, the pandemic has *really* worsened it. I did not talk to a lot of people physically during lockdown, so I got accustomed to the luxury of expressing myself at my own pace, checking for translations and wording things in just the right way to be understood as best as possible. Right now, when I try to say something complex, I end up being incredibly slow. This has had serious consequences in my social relationships, since I can't keep up with conversation.\n\nAnyway, you get the idea. That last paragraph is maybe not directly related to speaking English, and more of a written/spoken language thing, but it felt relevant enough to mention.\n\nI guess I'm here to ask for advice? Does anyone know what this is? What could I do? I've tried being more flexible with my choice of words in conversations, but that seemingly always leads to misunderstandings of some kind. It's really frustrating.",

I don’t have a strict timeline for this but want to take advantage of a young child’s incredible neural plasticity and introduce and use the non-English languages with consistency and efficacy as early as possible. Turkish and Korean would be heritage languages (one from each genetic lineage). This is extremely important to me because I had no Turkish resources after early childhood and my language abilities atrophied. I don’t want my child to resort to the easiest la language available (English) and miss out on important aspects of her cultural backgrounds. I know I’ll need outside resources to accomplish this successfully. \n\nI will be a single mother by choice and we live in a small town so I recognize it will take serious effort to achieve this. Thus far my preparation includes myself, books I have purchased that I will read to her, shows and games, friends and family via Zoom, and the hope of structured online conversation and tutoring. I spoke to Varsity Tutors but I don’t think they will be my first choice. They gave me tips on starting with two of the Level 1/2 languages and introducing Korean last (as a Level 4 language). They also suggested speaking one language all day certain days of the week. As an aside, I plan to learn Korean with her later in childhood and would like her to have basic fluency without excessive concern about native fluency (I apologize for not using the correct technical term). \n\nDoes anyone have experience with multi-lingual child rearing, these specific languages, how to introduce additional languages after the first two, sequencing of introductions, and, any programs that have especially helped very young children? Assume that native speakers aren’t in abundance and that there won’t be two parents but rather one, and likely a nanny/babysitter, plus an English-speaking community/school environment. Great books about the topic or in the target language for parents or children would be welcome, too. It was recommend I try this sub for evidence-based approaches to my goals. Anything helps.

Marshallese, Chuukese, Pohnpeian, Kosraean) are so different from each other and from what I understand, have very few cognates. \n\nI guess another way to ask it is why did the Polynesian language family spread so widely, with similarities across many thousands of miles, but the Micronesian languages are distinct, despite Chuuk being somewhat close to Pohnpei for example, and there being a history and culture of navigation and open-ocean sailing throughout Micronesia?",

So I'm doing research for my linguistics class about why Filipinos find it harder to speak/converse in pure Filipino as a result of the common use of Taglish (mix of Tagalog and English)/being bilingual. I'm kind of at a lost at finding related literature on how bilingualism (or even code switching) affects your fluency of your native language. Are there any studies similar to this (it doesn't have necessarily to be about Filipino) or a certain term/keyword I should use to search for it?\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nNote: I am not a linguist or studying to become one, it just so happens one of the classes I have to take is about linguistics and I am unfamiliar with the terms. I've already found literature on code switching and Taglish but I'm not sure if those studies would be enough.",
