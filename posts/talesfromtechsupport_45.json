        "text": "Howdy TFTS!\n\nToday I wanted to share a small tale that includes the hardest piece of equipment I have ever tried to use over telephone.\n\nCasting:\n\n&gt;**$me**: The idiot that has hobby homelab at home and is a working 2-shift CNC operator, and also the person that have never used my own toaster.\n\n&gt;**$toaster**: Angry little piece of shit that should heat up bread, but has a buzzer that it ain't afraid to use.\n\n&gt;**$sister**: **$me**'s little sister that goes to school near my apartment, so she swings by sometimes during long breaks or alike to eat or sleep some.\n\n***\n\n*(TL;DR in the bottom of the story)*\n\nThe story:\n\nIt all started of as a normal day in sweden during november. Rain, coldness and darkness. Alarm going of at 4 AM and all the good stuff.\n\nI get to work wich include swearing, tossing wrenches and generally cleaning up after the other shift.\n\nSometime around 12 AM I get a phone call from my sister and the following conversation took place:\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"You got a pissed of CNC Op. on the line, what can I help you with?\"\n\n&gt;**$sister**: \"T2 right?\"\n\n*Sidenote: for FANUC CNC-machines that are mills you call up a tool using `T# M6` where you replace the #-sign with a number. T2 in this case is a VERY expensive specialized tool that results in the bosses breathing down your neck when replacing*\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"Yep, how can I help you today? And no, netflix is blocked in my apartment wifi\"\n\n&gt;**$sister**: \"Well, today I wanted some toasted bread so I pulled out **$toaster** and tried to use it, but how does it toast?\"\n\n*Another sidenote: $toaster was something that I got with the apartment along with other equipment, so since I never had used it, I didn't know how to operate it*\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"Well, I imagine sticking some bread in it and turning the knob should to the trick?\"\n\n&gt;**$sister**: \"Well, I tried it and it just beeped at me\"\n\nOh... that was NOT something I had expected or even HEARD of!\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"Uhh, could you try it again and let me hear?\"\n\n&gt;**$toaster**: *(in the background)* \"BEEP BEEP BEEP\"\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"Well shit, aren't there buttons on the front of it? What happens when you press one of those?\"\n\nSome negotiation took place on what button to press and the result was the button to the right\n\n&gt;**$toaster**: \"BEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPP BEEEEEEEEEPPPPP BEEP\"\n\n&gt;**$me** *(now dumbfounded)*: \"Well pull me backwards, did it take the bread?\"\n\n&gt;**$sister**: \"Nope, only started to blink around the knob\"\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"Let's try rebooting it. Pull the plug and insert again\"\n\n&gt;**$toaster**: \"BEEP BEEP BEEP\"\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"Alrighty, try the middle-right button\"\n\n&gt;**$toaster**: \"BEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPP BEEP\"\n\n&gt;**$sister**: \"OH! Now it worked! k thx bye\"\n\n*click*\n\nWell, that probably did the trick I thought... until 3 minutes later I got another call from $sister\n\n&gt;**$sister**: Well, that went really bad! The toaster burned the bread to a crisp and I didn't find the button to cancel so I dumped the bread out and pulled the plug. How do I operate this thing?!\"\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"Well, if I had known, I would have shared the knowledge with you, but I'm at work so I have no idea. Try putting the knob to \"1\" and try another button\"\n\nSome new bread in it, and round 2\n\n&gt;**$sister**: \"*presses the middle-left button* alrigh... *(seconds pass)* nothings happening\"\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"Try the leftmost button, maybe that does something?\"\n\n&gt;**$toaster**: *(even with more fury cause we forced it to do something)* \"BEEEEEPPPP BEEEEPPPPP BEEEPPPP \\*clang\\* \\*rattling\\*\"\n\nsome time later\n\n&gt;**$toaster**: \"BEEP BEEEEEEPPPPPP BEEP BEEEEEEPPPPPPP\" with following rattling ensues\n\n&gt;**$sister**: \"Holy shit, it worked! But it barely toasted it...\"\n\n&gt;**$me**: \"Try to press the button twice, maybe it extends the period?\"\n\nEnd result: toaster got stuck halfway and only toasted half the bread.\n\nAfter being pissed off for a good amount of time, $sister and $me realized the knob wasn't a mode-selecting knob, but a heat-selecting knob.\n\nTo spare you the boring conversation during the toasting process, we had a success.\n\nAt 3 PM I finally got home and started to dig after a user manual for the toaster due to the icons above the buttons not really describing what they do, I finally found a PDF for it and printed it out so now my toaster has a paper with a \"How to toast\"-paper taped to it.\n\n**TL;DR**: Smart toaster rather uses a beeper than the heating elements and due to buttons not being user friendly, now has a \"How to toast\"-paper taped to it (removed before use.\n\n***\n\nHoly moly this story turned out to be long and I'm sorry for it. Hopefully atleast you found it somewhat funny and take care!\n\nAlso there is probably a lot of spelling mistakes in the text, but when I have a chance I will clean it up.",

        "text": "It was high summer, warm, sunny and beautiful, and I could tell-the shop was dead. I customarily post summer hours by mid-June, only going into the shop if I had work to do, then spending the rest of the summer catching up on my TBR list, keeping the garden from being ravaged by critters, and generally just a lot of loafing, well-seasoned with side-projects in the shop. (I repainted the shop, and rebuilt a vacuum cleaner.) \n\nSome necessary background: We live near-ish to the Appalachian Trail, and there's a spur that used to be an old rail line that's accessible (with some bushwhacking) literally from my back yard, which backs up onto conservation land. The rail trail connects to the local conservation land trail system, which in turn connects to the AT. My hiking buddy and I made plans over the winter to leave from my back yard and hike for five or six days, or however long it took us to get to the AT trailhead we had in mind. One day in late July, she let me know when her kids would be going to Grandma's for a couple weeks, and I let The Husband know she and I would be out. We planned to leave on a Monday morning, and that Sunday we went up and left my car at the trailhead. We left on time; by Monday night, we were lounging in the crossmembers of the old trestle bridge, watching the sun go down, eating dinner, and enjoying the silence (and a few adult beverages).\n\nThe hike itself was glorious but otherwise uneventful, until the morning of the last day. We had camped on the edge of public land the night before, just off the trail, and could hear people overnight. Not loud, but more than a few. The next morning after breakfast we headed out, hiked up over a knob and then down and around a bend and found ourselves smack in the middle of a large-ish LARP group who had pretty clearly settled in.\n\nWe were met by a forest warden and a Roman centurion, who offered us greetings and safe passage. My hiking buddy is much younger than I am, and grew up in this area (I didn't) and realized that one of the wizards was someone she knew from school, so we hung out for a bit. While they caught up, I wandered around and met people. During one of the 'so what do you do when you're not doing this' conversations, I mentioned the shop. The guy who had been introduced to me as Pierre the Peddler said, \"Hey, so I can see you're on vacation, but I'm really stuck. Would you mind looking at my sewing machine?\" This guy had packed and hiked in with a sewing machine. (Actually, he had a pretty cool thing, like a travois with wheels, that attached to his pack frame, and he towed his 'peddler's pack' instead of carrying a backpack.)\n\n...Ok, sure. They were already firing the pit for lunch, so I knew I'd at least get fed out of it, and we weren't expected back home for another couple of days, so staying wouldn't really put us behind schedule much. Why not? A few minutes later I was ensconced at a picnic table with a late 1800's hand-cranked boat shuttle sewing machine, three different Leatherman tools (including mine), a hammer from the smith, a tiny screwdriver from a glasses repair kit, and a cup of tea. (My people!)\n\nIn vibrating shuttle machines, there's a swing arm on the bottom. One end is attached to the mechanism that makes it go (the inside end of the belt drive, basically), and the other, free-swinging end has the shuttle carriage. The bobbin itself is shaped like a barbell, and fits into a shuttle that looks something like a cross between a boat and a big bullet, depending on age, brand, and style of machine. This shuttle rides along an inside slide. The needle comes down vertically into a slot in this slide, which is only *just* big enough for the needle. As the needle rises, the thread pouches out, and the tip of the passing shuttle goes catches it. The shuttle goes through the loop of thread, which tightens as the needle rises, completing the stitch.\n\nThese old machines are usually built pretty idiot-proof. All the parts only go in one way and are then pinned into place. If you've got it together, you've got it together right-there are no other options. There are, however a few places that are adjustable (more or less), so that was the first thing I checked. The shuttle carriage is attached to the swing arm with a screw in a slot, so you can slide the carriage back and forth. Judging by the amount of effort I had to put into breaking the screw loose (and the corresponding dirty/clean spot) that wasn't it. \n\nSo I slowly turned the handcrank, and just watched everything for a couple of revolutions, and every time the swing arm passed the center point of the slide where the needle is, it just looked...off. I popped the shuttle out and did it again, watching the empty carriage pass the needle groove. I was beginning to have an idea of what was wrong, but not how it got that way. I examined the slide nose on the shuttle-the smooth flat curved end that rides along the slide. Now I was pretty sure what was going on. I put the shuttle back in, cranked it some more, and compared the tip of the shuttle to the wear lines on the slide (there's always a shiny stripe). The tip of the shuttle nose was about 3/8\" above the shiny stripe on the slide, which corresponded nicely to the new-looking wear on the very bottom edge of the slide nose. Time to go find Pierre.\n\n\"Hey man, so how long you been out?\"\n\n\"Oh, since mid-March, I guess. I started in Georgia, and have been working my way from Faire to Faire and any other event that looks interesting. Like this one!\"\n\n\"Cool. You hike all the way?\"\n\n\"No, actually, I biked most of it. I just hike in if I need to. My bike is in the lot at the trailhead.\" *Explains his convertible travois. I am suitably impressed.*\n\n\"Anything exciting happen?\"\n\n\"Not really. Well, I got chased by a herd of cows about a month ago. I heard coyotes, and it was getting on for dusk, so maybe that's what set 'em off, but I never saw them. I ended up in a ditch, but it beat getting trampled. That's about it, though.\"\n\n\"So when did your machine problems start?\"\n\n\"Come to think, right about then.\"\n\nRight. When Pierre and his travois went arse over teakettle into the ditch, something in his pack shifted into the swing arm of the sewing machine and bent it out of place-the tip of the shuttle was too high to catch the thread, and crooked to boot. Since I didn't have a pair of sizable pliers to bend it back with, I took the swing arm out and took it to the blacksmith, who beat it flat for me, and then put it back. That was all it took. I recommended he get a case for it, or at a minimum, some sort of bottom to protect the mechanism, and showed him how to check if it was out of alignment. We had lunch with the crowd and then headed out; friend and I were only mildly behind schedule coming off the trail. We passed Pierre's bike locked in the bike rack on the way out.\n\nI told the story to my husband, who laughed, shook his head, and said, \"Only you could find a broken sewing machine in the middle of the mountains, and still get it fixed,\" then I forgot all about it.\n\nUntil about a month later, when my phone tweedled at me-I'd gotten a payment through Paypal, from Pierre. There was a note attached, apologizing for the delay but explaining that he'd only just gotten back to civilization that included wifi. He appreciated the save and hoped the amount was enough (he'd guessed pretty right, actually), and that he hoped to see me again next time he was back in the area, so he could show me his new, lightweight sewing machine case.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! It's been a while since I've posted in tfts about the library I work in, but the other day I had an experience that I felt I needed to share. Enjoy!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nSo at the library I'm employed at we offer a faxing service at $1.00 a page. This is a pretty good price, as the only other nearby place that will provide faxing is the currency exchange and they charge quite a bit more. This can be an issue however when patrons have a large job they want to fax, as our coinbox only accept single dollars, five dollars, coins, and a debit or credit card. If you use the debit card it will put a $20.00 hold on your account, but you can't add more money on top of it. Essentially this means if you have over 20 pages to fax, you have to use cash or fax your pages 20 at a time.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I'm sitting at the front desk, eager to help as always, when Bad Listener (BL) comes up to me and asks for help faxing.   \n\n\n&gt;**BL**: It's gunna cost an arm and a leg to fax all this isn't it?  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: *looks at mountai of papers BL has* Well it's one dollar per page to fax.  \n\n\n\n&gt;**BL**: *sighs deeply* Well does the machine take $20's?  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: No unfortunately it only takes up to a five dollar bill. However you can also use debit, but that would put a $20 hold on your card and you wouldn't be able to add more money on top of it.  \n\n\n\n&gt;**BL**: *shrugs* We'll come to that when we get there, can you show me how to use the machine?  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: Sure!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo we go ahead and start scanning. All in all he had 61 pages, which came out to $60. At one point he just stuffed most of the pile in to the auto-feeder, after I told him to do it in small chunks, and ended up jamming it and ripping his paper. After taping that back up and making sure to do the rest in small chunks, we managed to scan everything.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nWhen we scan papers, we have to wait for every page to be scanned, then pay the coin box, then hit next. Many patrons want to hit next right away, which I understand, but after I let them know how it works they learn to wait until it's done and they've paid. BL had different plans. Every time he hit scan he immediately went to push next, and I had to remind him each time that he would have to wait until the scans over. Five times we did this. As I said though, we made it through, and it was time to pay the piper.    \n\n&gt;**ME**: *repeats the different options to pay**  \n\n\n&gt;**BL**: *starts to put a twenty dollar bill in*  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: Sorry sir, the machine only takes up to a five.   \n\n\n&gt;**BL**: Does it take credit?  \n\n&gt;**ME**: Yes, but only up to twenty dollars, so you'd only be able to fax 20 pages.  \n\n\n&gt;**BL**: *shows me the twenties in his wallet* So if I used these and the card?  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: No sir, as I said you can't add more cash on top of using a credit card, also the machine doesn't take twenty dollar bills.  \n\n\n&gt;**BL**: But I already scanned all this.   \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: Yes.  \n\n\n&gt;**BL**: So how would be the best way to do this?  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: I would recommend sending twenty pages at a time.  \n\n\n&gt;**BL**: ....alright fuck it let's just do it.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo eventually we send all the pages out. Of course on the last batch of pages he accidentally scanned 21 pages and we had to delete 1, and he argued with me for a short time about which page we had deleted even though it was the last on scanned and I verified it with my own eyes. But we got it done.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nDuring this time a lovely sweet family came down needing to fax. I let them know it would be a minute and they nodded patiently. I think they finally left around the time we was asking me if there was anyway to confirm that the fax number he had typed in about 7 times was the correct fax number.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nFinally he left, visibly angry, and with a gruff 'thank you'. I sat back down at the desk, and looked at the clock. It had taken two hours to do what is usually a 5 minute job, even for someone with that much to fax. Almost immediately another patron walks up to the desk, too busy looking at their phone to acknowledge me, and asks,  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\"Can you help me fax?\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nEdit: I forgot one of the funner details of this story. While he was paying for the last fax, which was a single page, I let him know he could use a five dollar bill instead of his debit card, as the debit card would put a $20 hold on his account which would take up to 48 hours to be cleared (it's usually much sooner than this though).  \n\n&gt;**BL**: What? \" *continues to put debit card in*  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: You can use a five instead, as using your debit card will put a $20.00 hold on your account which can take up to 48 hours to clear.  \n\n\n&gt;**BL**: ..........  \n\n\n*coinbox beeps as the money is put on hold*  \n\n\n\n&gt;**BL**: Well now it's already done! So basically now I have a $19.00 balance with you guy's I'm never going to use?!  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: No, it's a hold. It'll clear within 48 hours.  \n\n\n&gt;**BL**:...like go back into my account?  \n\n\n&gt;**ME**: Yes.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "We have a somewhat elderly lady working in Customer Service, where data entry is a large part of her job. As part of record entry of new customer orders, she has to click a button on the toolbar to attach documents to the order. However, near that button on the toolbar, there is another button that looks similar, called \"Document Lifecycle.\" That button opens up a new form, which searches the entire system for related records to the customer order. It works great when you're showing off a demo system with 200 customer orders, and less so when you have an actual live production system with millions of records to search each time the button is pressed. Each time you click this button, the program locks up for about 10 minutes while it goes looking.\n\nNew Ticket: *Life Cycle icon*\n\nDescription:\n&gt; Could you please lose the icon or make it  inaccessible on my computer.  I've clicked on that darn thing in error twice and it's a nightmare!  I don't think I will ever use it except in error!\n\nWhen the ticket came in, I went looking to see if the vendor had updated the form to make things run any faster. I did find some updates, but they only resulted in about a 10% improvement. The button in question is actually bound to the form, and isn't just something you can turn off in settings. So I installed the patches, and closed the ticket.\n\nSolution:\n&gt; We've installed some patches to get to the latest version of this form, and while we have seen a quantifiable improvement in speed, we're still having performance issues. There's another update coming later that should continue to work on this issue, but it's going to be wrapped into a service pack and is not yet available to us. Once that service pack releases, we will be pushing to get it implemented.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, we are unable to remove the button for the Lifecycle form.\n\nAbout an hour, I get an email response:\n&gt; Well, that’s too bad.  \nCould you train me not to hit it in error??\n\nI... really didn't know how to respond to that. I considered a number of things, sending back a screenshot of the button with a big arrow next to it that says \"DON'T CLICK THIS.\" I considered the more BOFH approach of just increasing keyboard voltage any time the button was pressed unintentionally. \n\nFinally though, I realized that there was a training program for exactly this, built into Windows.\n\n&gt; In all seriousness, just slow down. When we do repetitive tasks, sometimes muscle memory takes over and it becomes easy to not look closely at what you’re clicking on. (Kinda like distracted driving.)\n\n&gt; Not a joke, I actually recommend playing minesweeper on your computer at home. Minesweeper and Solitaire were added to windows back in the 3.1 days, to train mouse discipline without the users even realizing they were learning. Solitaire was added to teach users how to Drag and Drop, Minesweeper taught using the right/left mouse buttons and mouse precision/control.\n\nThat's gotta be the first time I've closed a ticket by recommending the user play Minesweeper.",

This fun story happened right before Labor Day and my birthday so I wasn't expecting a whole lot of activity during this week and was somewhat checked out. Closer to the end of the day, I received an email (not a ticket like she’s supposed to submit)  from a new-ish remote staff member who I'm sure does not know how to turn on her computer without the help of her fellow colleagues at her location. This is the type of person to blame the brand new macbook computer she received for all of her problems. (Which, she has done very recently.) Anyways, let's get to the email dialogue.\n\n\n**LWIGWC** - Lady Who Isn't Good With Computers\n\n\n**TheLPiddy** - Me\n\n\n&gt;**LWIGWC:** Hi TheLPiddy, I just want to let you know that the headphone you gave me do not work in the MacBook Air computer that was given to me.  This is not really a big deal but I love the fancy ones you gave me.... do you want them back? ....it has the USB rectangular end and the computer needs the small circular kind (have NO clue as to what the end is called). Thanks... have a great LONG weekend!  Happy Labor day!\n\n\n&gt;**TheLPiddy:** *(Wondering if I ordered the wrong headset and wondering if English is not her first language.)* Hi! All headphones that we issue are compatible with the macbooks. Can you take a photo of the the end of the headset please? \n\n\n&gt;**LWIGWC:** *Sends picture of the end of the USB headset* Coworker and I both tried it.... ... lol.... doesn't work!  The hole on the side with the headphone icon is round *(At this point, I notice that she has an unhealthy obsession with adding unnecessary punctuation to everything and that she’s not all there, to put it nicely.)*  \n&gt;**TheLPiddy:** So you haven't tried plugging it into the USB port? *(Oooo, that was a bit of a petty response. Put your professional hat back on.)*\n\n\n&gt;**TheLPiddy:** *(Follow Up E-mail, just to give her the benefit of the doubt because no one can be that... well you get the drift)* The headset it meant for your USB port.

This is a big problem, no one can do any work and nothing is working!    \n**Me:** OK, I'm getting a connection to your server so it looks like it's up and your external network connection is fine.

        "text": "To set the stage, $Agency (same one with the brainwashed server from a previous take) is running very old equipment. They have a VOIP system so you got the ethernet running to the phones and from the phones you have another cable going to the PC at each desk. Thus, if something happens to the phone you lose connectivity on your PC. Now, this VOIP system is about 10-15 years in age. It's long been past its prime and no vendor in the area is willing to offer a support contract. Thus burnt offerings during staff meetings and sheer will power are what's keeping this VOIP system going.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYesterday I get a ticket from one of the folks out there:  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Client:** (email) Dear Help Desk, I received a notification this morning that my hard drive is full. Please let me know what I can do to correct this. Thanks.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSimple enough, run a quick scan and I find the biggest outlier being a 36gb Outlook pst ($PST) just hanging out in her C: drive.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** (email) Dear $Client. What do you know about $PST? I found it on your computer and it's eating up a fourth or your hard drive space. Is this a leftover file from when we did your email migration a while back? Otherwise, if it's a crucial file I'll need to get $PST moved over to the file server so that it's both off of your computer and is being backed up.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is where I would remote in to poke around a bit, but I can't deploy our remote tool since the hard drive is at 0MB available. So, a couple of email exchanges later I found out that $PST is indeed a company used file so I give her a call.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** Helloooooooooo $Client, this is $Savy!  \n&gt;**$Client:** Well hello to you too!! What can I do for ya?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Well, like I mentioned in the emails, I really want to move $PST over to the server. Given the size of it, the file transfer is gonna take a few hours *(again, old equipment)*.  \n&gt;**$Client:** Okay, that's fine. Will I still be able to open Outlook later tonight if I remote in?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** I'm not 100% sure on that as $PST seems to be integrated into your Outlook. At best, Outlook will just throw a fit but continue working. At worst Outlook will refuse to start.  \n&gt;**$Client:** Hmm, that's okay. It's close to the end of the day so there's not a lot I need to do.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Perfect!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBefore the call I had already pulled up her C: drive through explorer as well as her personal network drive on the file server where I was gonna drop off $PST.  So, at this point, I click to start the file transfer since I got her OK to do so.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** Oh! Don't forget that you still have access to your email through the web portal if you need it and Outlook doesn't work for you tonight!!  \n&gt;**$Client:** ....  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Umm, I'll follow up with you tomorrow morning to see how the transfer went?    \n&gt;**$Client:** ...  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Hello?  \n&gt;**$Client:** ....  \n&gt;**Savy:** *(I take off my headset thinking I let the battery run out again and pick up my phone)* Hellooooo??  \n&gt;**$Client:** .....ng....ca....row?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** I'm sorry, you're breaking up. What was that?  \n&gt;**$Client:** Ca....r.....ink....ne....pr....ms.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Umm, what??  \n&gt;**$Client:** ....re....Wi.....lp...el....cel....ne!!  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Want me to call you on your cell phone??  \n&gt;**$Client:** ....LL...CELL....L!!!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI hang up the call and dial her on her cell phone.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** Hola!  \n&gt;**$Client:** [\"hello\" in foreign language\"]  \n&gt;**$Savy:** What was the last thing you caught me saying?  \n&gt;**$Client:** Something about the web. By the way, my desk phone is completely dead now?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** How?!  \n&gt;**$Client:** It started flashing like crazy and eventually it just shut off. Do you want me to unplug and try reconnect it?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** *noticing $PST is still magically transferring despite the phone dying* Not yet...let's wait until morning.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Resolution?**  \nThe next morning I checked in and found that $PST transferred without error, but I couldn't get in touch with $Client to find out what happened with ~~the remains of~~ her desk phone.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR:** Make sure your VOIP phones are set to Wumbo instead of Mini when transferring large Outlook pst's over the network.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Formatting ",

It will lead to many bad things and headaches.\n\nSo who of all people would do such a terrible thing to a machine like that? the Share point admin -____________-\n\nFunny thing was that he knew better than to do that but was impatient enough to do it. So once he did that not only did he kill the OS, it tripped the encryption software and nuked his drive deleting everything he had on the machine. \n\nLucky for him the most important stuff he needed was backed up and he was able to recover the data from a backup. My boss bought him an etch n sketch and said that will be his machine next time he did something like that. I was dying when I heard that from my boss.\n\nI look forward to bringing in more tales to share! Have a good day everyone!",

        "text": "'sup? \n\nSo, i'm a network engineer for a large automotive supplier. Used to do campus networks, now upgraded to some additional datacenter stuff. The story of /u/ShittyFieldTech about dropping packets reminded me of the following happen the other day.\n\nFirst some info about what i'm working with. The main reason that we built the datacenter(DC) that's been growing rampant for the last few years, is simulation. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but my business unit is developing hardware for cars. Driver assistance systems, e.g. fancy cameras in your windscreen that detect stuff and tell you or even the rest of the vehicle about it to make it do stuff.\n\nWe take this hardware, connect it to a server in a rack, grab some real recorded data from roads all over the world from our 40PB storage (this is the most relevant part for the story coming) and fool the hardware into believing that it's installed in a vehicle that's driving around somewhere. \n\n--\n\nSome sunny day in summer, some department of our huge central IT comes to us - usually it's the other way round - and asks if they can build a data analytics cluster in our DC. They came to us, because they couldn't find such a huge amount of very similar data anywhere in the whole companys two central DCs. Their DCs are humongous, but we have about 30PB worth of really closely similar crap.\n\nSo we tell them that they're free to bring their hardware and install it themselves, then they're free to use the data we have.\n\nThe people involved:\n$SOP: ESX Server operator from central IT.\n\n$TL: My team lead. First level of...leadery.\n\n$DL: $SOPs department lead. Third level of leadery\n\n$me: well...me, of course, a network engineer with enough experience and not enough whiskey.\n\n\nThe day comes as two racks are filled with two dozens of servers, all capable of network speeds up to 100G.\nSome hired tech sends me a list of ports on my two switches and which VLANs (different Networks) need to be provided at which port. Some ports get multiple VLANs at the same time, which requires VLAN Tagging. A VLAN tag tells the next piece of hardware, which network the packet that it just received belongs to. I configure all the ports as desired, putting all ports with access to just one VLAN into non-tagged mode. Because why tag VLANs if there's just one single VLAN available on the port, right?\n\nThe hired tech installs all the cabling and reports to $SOP. $SOP in turn starts powering the servers up and installing ESX, a virtualisation software. Allows you to have a lot of virtual machines(VMs) running on one piece of hardware, in case you haven't heard of it. One thing he needs to set up is vSAN for \"virtual Storage Area Network.\" It basically allows the multiple ESX servers to shove around VM hard drive images between each other. Nice to have in case a server goes down, then the VM should just keep on running on one of the others. This whole vSAN thing uses multicast to communicate. Basically one source and multiple destinations.\n\nFor some reason...vSAN ain't working. Email communication occurs:\n\n&gt; $SOP to $me: Hi, the vSAN isn't working. Multicast routing needs to be configured on your switches for it to work. Please do that ASAP, customer is waiting.\n\n&gt; $me to $SOP: Hey. Can you confirm that the machines can communicate with each other at all? They're in the same subnet, that shouldn't require any special multicast routing configuration, because it's all switched anyways.\n\n&gt; $SOP to $TL+$me: Hey $TL, i've been told you're the expert for this kind of configuration, please get in contact with $me to sort this out. I've been working with this for ages and am operating 20 clusters that are set up this way. In the past it's always been the missing multicast routing that caused any issues. *He obviously didn't know that $TL is not an expert, but my team lead.*\n\n&gt; $TL to $me+$SOP: Hey $me, can you take care of this, please? *obviously didn't read the rest of the conversation*\n\n&gt; $me to $TL+$SOP: Hey $TL. Have you read the rest of the convo? I asked him to confirm basic functionality. If that's how cooperation works here nowadays, should i send an email to $DL telling him that one of his employees is not capable of answering a simple question? There's a completely different issue at hand than multicast routing.\n\n\nAn hour later my phone rings.\n\n&gt; $SOP: Hey $me. I thought it'd be easier to solve this via phone. You've got some time for this?\n\n&gt; $me: Hey. Yeah sure. So, i checked the IPs of your machines, they're not responding to any pinging. *I know my routing is done right, which means something is wrong starting from the ports of my switches.*\n\n&gt; $SOP: Yeah, but it's usually multicast...\n\n&gt; $me: It's not multicast. Period. Your machines have zero connectivity for some reason, multicast not working is a symptom of that. What about the info that your hired tech gave me, is that correct or even complete?\n\n&gt; $SOP: Actually no, there is some info missing about tagged VLANs.\n\n&gt; $me: Let me guess, all those ports that only have one VLAN on them are configured for tagging on your side?\n\n&gt; $SOP: Yes, exactly.\n\n&gt; $me *facepalming*: Wh...no, i don't care why, i will just conf my switch for tagging aswell and get this over with. Tell your people to provide complete information next time. And if you want someone to help you, answer their questions instead of contacting their leader.\n\n**TL;DR**: \"User\" thinks the issue is highly complicated. I think it's not. User refuses to help me help him and contacs leaders. Turns out i was right.",

        "text": "Background: about a decade in IT support - networks, hardware, software. I have worked for different companies that provide IT support to other companies.\n\nDisclosure: English is not my first language, so there probably are mistakes. If the mistakes bother you, please point them out, I will try to correct them.\n\nAll this was kind of my fault. Here's what happened.\n\nA client had a workstation that needed a new network line. The clients electrician pulled the cable and our company was supposed to plug the ends.\n\nThe task was assigned to one of my co-workers, still a newbie, an intern who was recently promoted to a full-time tech. \n\nHe was away for a while, when he got back he came to me (I had done a lot of support for the client, so I knew their system best).\n\n&gt;$coworker - Hey, Visavillem. I had an issue with the network there. As soon as I plugged the cable in, the Internet was gone. Like for the whole company.\n\n&gt;$me - Bloody hell. Where did you stick that cable?\n\n&gt;$coworker - In one of the switches at the workstation.\n\n&gt;$me - Did you disconnect any other devices?\n\n&gt;$coworker - No, there were so many cables, I didn't know where they went.\n\n&gt;$me - Did you ever wondered how that workstation was connected to the office network?\n\n&gt;$coworker - No….\n\nI knew exactly what was wrong and, as stated at the beginning, it was kind of my fault.\n\nLet's go back about a year.\n\nThe client was a hotel and they had a WiFi solution for the guests. The solution was not very good - just a bunch of standalone AP-s around the rooms, a few switches. It was on a separate VLAN, internet was provided through their main router. So they decided (finally!) to replace the it. It got a dedicated internet line, all the network equipment was replaced by the supplier.\n\nThe bad thing was, this was done without consulting with us. There was a workstation that was connected through the old WiFi system. Now this workstation had no link to the office LAN, but it was a POS system that needed a direct connection to their accounting database. And I only found out when they called to report that the \"Internet\" does not work on the POS. Then I realised that the guest network was already rebuilt and most of the old equipment was thrown out.\n\nI asked the local electrician how fast can he pull another cable to the POS, he said it's going to take a few months because he's schedule was full.\n\nOk, I can create a temporary solution for that, but it's going to suck and has to be replaced with a cable ASAP.\n\nI informed the client about the risks and problems, she was OK with that.\n\nSo i built a WiFi bridge. We had some leftover access points from the old system, so I configured one of them as an AP and another as a Client Bridge and connected one end to the office LAN switch, the other end to a switch at the POS (there were a few IP cameras and a card terminal that needed the network connectivity also). It was an ugly solution, the signal was not very strong (there was a thick limestone wall in between), but it worked.\n\nWe had an agreement with the client that this is a temporary solution and it will come down as soon as the new cable was pulled.\n\nAbout every two monhts I checked with the client when the cable would be ready. And every time they assured me that it will be done next week.\n\nFast forward one year, when the events at the beginning of the story took place.\n\nSo I went to the client, unplugged my WiFi bridge, plugged the new cable in and everything worked.\n\nWhy didn't it work before? Because when my co-worker connected the network cable he created a loop with one side going through the WiFi bridge and other through the new cable. My fault was not documenting the \"custom solution\" because I thought it's going to be temporary, why bother. Also I was sure that when the cable is ready, I'll be the one to connect it. \n\nHad my co-worker bothered to check the clients tickets, he would have found the description of the WiFi bridge (I intentionally left the ticket unresolved so it would stick out when the time would come to replace the connection). But who checks old tickets anyway?\n\nTL;DR - There are only few things in this world more permanent than the temporary solutions. ",

        "text": "I'm not really a tech, but a programmer/developer for a non-profit in our internal IT department managing our main database and the software that interacts with it. Anytime there is a new issue that seems out of the ordinary, I'm the lucky one that gets first dibs at debugging it.This story is one of my favorite issues.  \n\nOur office handles most of our donations (including international) with the exception of Canada because we have a separate office there. For this reason, we send a .dbf file to our neighbors twice a week with any Canadian transactions we received since the last export. I recieve an email from our contact in Canada with screenshots of a few records in our system marked as 'Exported' (with a filename) and a complaint that said records were not in the file sent 3 weeks ago.  \n\nFirst step, verify the records. The screenshots are legit and said records are marked as 'exported. Second verify the files. I dig through archives and find the exact file mentioned, it has 50 records in it but does not contain the ones in the screenshots. Double check the database to find there should be 67 records in that file. Issue confirmed.  \n\nI start looking at any recent code changes to the export process. Last code change was 3 years ago, so it can't be a bugged update. Check the export program on the server, still has a 'last modified' time stamp of 3 years ago, matching the day of the last code change.  \n\nSo I run the program locally to verify it still works, and it created a new csv with 67 records. But wait, we export a dbf not a csv so I have to ask why. It turns out that many years ago, a dbf was the only option for importing into their system. So we convert the file through a third party program before sending it.  \n\nTime to check the file converter. I log in to the server, start the program and convert my test file. The output has only 50 records. I look closer at the documentation for this converter and it states \"unregisterd version only converts the first 50 records in a file.\" WTF, we've had many files in the past that were over 50 records and they converted just fine. We do have a registration key for this program so it doesn't make sense that it would stop working out of nowhere.  \n\nAsk the boss if anything changed with the servers around the date of the file. I was on vacation that week so I know it's not my fault.  \n&gt;Boss: Yes we moved the database to a new server that week.  \n&gt;Me: Was registering that program in the checklist for the move?  \n&gt;Boss: It should have been, look up the registration info get that fixed.  \n\nI find the registration info, re-apply the key, test with my file and it works. I get a file made for the missing records, re-run the automated job to convert and export the files, then I'm done. Or so I thought.  \n\nThe next day I get another email that the new file only contains 50 records in it as well. What? I tested every part of the process. Then I remembered, the automated job runs as a specific user. Logging into the server as that user shows the program still unregisterd. Apply the key, run the job again, this time looking at the exported file to verify it contains all the records.  \n\n2 weeks later I find out our DBA who did the move, registered the program as the wrong user.

Dead, adapter looks good. Check for loose cables. Open computer (laptop). Something moves. Something... That's not a fan... Oh, heck no.. sprayed with raid..  double bagged..  deposited outside in a locked vehicle..  long story short. Spilled something (coke?) into the laptop. Let it sit. Got infested. Brought it to the computer store the day before thanksgiving in an attempt to infest computer store. End result. Yeah, your computer will never work again. Data looks readable. Roaches are dead (thankfully). And I saved the store from a roach infestation by getting to a machine quickly. (I hate roaches.)",

        "text": "Germany was an amazing duty station filled with opportunity.  I could travel, see amazing sights and eat new, amazing foods.  One of my favorite trips was not for leisure, however—it was for work.  \n\nPoland joined NATO in 1999, having escaped being a cheerful and happy and entirely not coerced member of the Warsaw Pact upon the collapse of the Soviet Union.  For the first short while, little had happened but post 9/11 the opportunities to participate in foreign military excursions skyrocketed.  In 2004, they’d finally decided to join the Freedom Train and send over some troops to join ISAF—NATO’s International Security Assistance Forces—in Afghanistan.  One unit they’d decided to send was a company of MI-24 Hinds. Unfortunately, you can’t normally fly helicopters that far and still retain a budget/sanity/airworthiness, so the problem came down to shipping these helicopters across an ocean to the actual theatre where they would fight.  \n\nThe catch with shipping helicopters by boat is even more of a show-stopper than flying them.  Sure, flying would be miserable and would drive the helicopter to an early grave, but just dropping them on a boat would be a death sentence.  Navy guys can tell you, salt water loves to eat metal, especially aluminum, and helicopters are pretty much made of the stuff.  If you want to get a helicopter at the final destination and not a decidedly worthless pile of un-fun white powder, plastic and seat cushions, you need to wrap it up in heavy plastic with some drains and vents installed.  \n\nHaving never projected force before (Or at least not for a long, long while…), needless to say the Poles had no idea how to do any of this and would require some assistance—which is where yours truly came in.  \n\n***\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Sure, I’d love to go to Poland!”\n\n&gt;**PlatoonSergeant** “Great, get with SergeantM ($SGM) and find out the training plan.  You guys leave in three days.”\n\nI had just arrived in Germany a few months before and had missed out on the 60th Anniversary Memorial of D-Day, meaning while the majority of my unit was off in France flying around VIPs, I had been stuck in Mannheim twiddling my thumbs.  Since that arrival, I’d had additional duty after additional duty dumped on me with little actual maintenance opportunity. When my platoon sergeant had come to me that morning to see if I’d be willing to take some time away from my  busy schedule of inventorying chemicals and watching contractors fix my engines to head out to Poland, well…I had my bag packed as he was speaking!\n\nI found $SGM and he directed me that tomorrow morning we would have a 0800 showtime at our sister unit’s hangar across the airfield where we would learn to gift-wrap helicopters.  I was stoked—not only Poland, but now I was getting out of PT (Physical Training, ie, *exercise*) for the rest of the week! The next morning found us paired up with members of the other unit and we spent the first half of the day learning how to wrap a Blackhawk. \n\nOne might think it to be fairly simple, but the process is a little more involved than one might expect.  Because the plastic with which we are wrapping the helicopter is a heat-shrink type, in order to keep the helicopter’s various sharp edges from ripping right through it we had to scour the entire bird wrapping various protuberances with foam, tape and paper cups.  Once the helicopter had been ‘softened’, we were to wrap it with giant rolls of white heat-shrink plastic, taping the sheets in place as we went and trying find a balance between cutting it enough, attaching it, and not slicing ourselves open as the razors dulled quickly.  After taping it in place, we were given propane tanks with torch attachments which we then used to apply heat to shrink the plastic.  Again, it became a balancing act of not melting the plastic, getting it to shrink, not burning the helicopter, and not torching our eyebrows off or lighting ourselves on fire.   (I would later nearly fail at this…)\n\nFirst wrapping completed, we went to lunch and upon our return we stripped the covering off and did it once more, taking a bit less time than before.  Having proven to our instructors our proficiency, we were dismissed for the rest of the day.\n\n***\nThe next day saw us in a briefing where it was explained we needed to do this on the Down Low for Reasons.  I was never told anything different, but best as I can figure they just wanted to keep it quiet for regular Operational Security reasons. This requirement for being incognito meant we were to do this entire operation in civilian clothes and try not to be too noticeable.  (Yup, a bunch of American military aged men, with military haircuts, travelling in a big group, wearing civilian clothes….)\n\n***\n\nDeparture day arrived and we left out early in the morning.  After a nice, long drive across Germany, we crossed over into Poland and arrived at the port of Szczecin.  We exited from our vans into a warehouse, in which there were six Mi-24 Hind Attack Helicopters waiting for us, devoid of blades and external stores.  The advance party had already brought up all the stands we would need to get up the sides of the aircraft and all of our materials, and we set to wrapping the helicopters.  Within the first ten minutes, however, we’d had our first casualty.\n\nI’d been pushing a stand in position but when I let go, it caught and smashed my thumb.  I needed the hand to be able to wrap the foam on the helicopter, so instead I was given some light runner chores.  Once the first helicopter had all the foam applied, half the crew moved on to the next to begin foaming it while the other half remained to apply the plastic wrap.  Once that was complete, I was handed one of the torches and sent to work while they moved on to start the second helicopter.  \n\nBy the end of the day, we’d completed three birds, when our expected quota was only two.  We called it an early night, and came back the next morning.\n\n***\n\nWhile at breakfast on day 2 of the trip, I spoke to the Major in command of our little party.  He told me about how he’d been flying in Germany for years, back when the Army still used UH-1 Hueys.  In particular, he explained, his favorite bird he absolutely loved to fly was the one on static display on our base.\n\n*Cue memory: Blurry night about two months prior, far too much drink and not nearly enough sense.  A ~~slightly~~ entirely inebriated ZeeWulf being led by a friend back to his barracks room stops in front of a UH-1 on display.*\n\n&gt;*ZeeWulf “Heyyymaaaannn…  You scheee this?  Ish’ a Huey.  The engine is fun..I lurv it….its…its amayshing...”*\n\n*ZeeWulf approaches helicopter door, hugs it, starts whispering things to it.*\n\nI looked across my plate at the Major and made it a priority to be elsewhere ASAP.\n\n***\n\nSoon after our arrival at the warehouse, the Polish ground crew and air crew arrived to learn exactly what we were doing for their helicopters.   We started explaining what we were doing to the crew, while one of the pilots offered us coffee.  The Major was the first to take them up on the offer and after drinking a sip returned it with a kind word.\n\n&gt;**Major** “HEY!  No one is allowed to have their coffee!  Yes, I mean you too, $SGM!  Put that cup down!”\n\nTurns out it was pretty high-octane coffee.  Which was a crying shame.  \n\nMy hand had healed up some in the overnight, but I was still on torch duty.  At one point, a pocket of propane had gotten caught in one of the folds of plastic and back-flared on me, scorching my eyebrows, hair and even slightly melting the fleece I was wearing.  I wasn’t hurt, but it was a great time, and talking to the Polish crew was proving to be loads of fun, especially as they enjoyed more of their coffee.  \n\nAt one point, the crewman I’d been working with brought me over to his own helicopter which we were working on starting to wrap.  He explained to me that her name was *Motyl*--Butterfly.   His beautiful Butterfly.   It made perfect sense to me, naming an attack helicopter that way.  Once we’d finished wrapping his bird, he took a can of spray paint and sprayed a grinning shark mouth with bright eyes and butterfly wings on the fuselage.  Getting into the game of things, we also started spraying fun little messages on the helicopters too, my own being a big smiley face on the tail boom. \n\nBefore we had finished wrapping up the last, however, having learned I was an engine guy my polish compatriot ushered me to the top of his helicopter.  Opening the engine cowl, he showed me one of the massive powerplants which powered this behemoth of a helicopter.  \n\n&gt;**Polish Crewman**  “You like?”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Holy cheezits, this thing is HUGE!”\n\nHe laughed, and then grinned at me.  \n\n&gt;**Polish Crewman**  “Well, you know vat zehy zay.  In Royossia, everytink is bigger!”\n\n\n\n*Author's final note: I wanted to actually make a joke in the title about Texas and Russia, but considering the...ahem...stuff going on in the news world these days, I'd rather just avoid any inflammatory titling.*\n\nEdit: Math and I hate each other and I wrote the wrong D-Day anniversary...\n\nEdit 2: **TL;DR: Cold War-era aircraft is bigger, crew is vodka powered**\n\nEdit 3: [Look, everything in chronological order!](https://redd.it/7i0esb)",

        "text": "6 months working IT Helpdesk and I'm sick of it. Mainly because the job by definition is working with users with issues, and a lot of the time they are understandably frustrated. But I still can't get over the entitlement and nerve of these people to think they can berate me when they don't get their way. This is one of those example:\n\nBe $me, working an average Monday (so crappy with more calls than average but fewer calls than when we're \"busy\"). It's during a quiet time when I get a call. Very quickly the girl calling suddenly turns into a $bitch when I don't immediately do what she want, here is said encounter:\n\n**$me:** OTS Helpdesk how may I help you?  \n**$bitch:** Yes can I get the number to the parking department?  \n**$me:** Ma'am you'll need to speak to a call center representative, this is the IT Helpdesk.  \n**$bich:** Why do you have an attitude with me?!  \n**$me:** I don't have an attitude ma'am I'm just letting you know that this is the IT Helpdesk and you'll need to talk to the call center to...  \n**$bitch:** But you guys *always* redirected us when did you get a call center?! \\*insert scoffs and a bunch of pissy noises.\\*  \n**$bitch:** You must be new, you don't know your job!\n\nShe then proceeds to hang up, I then quietly mutter to myself that she's the one with the attitude and that I know my job better than she would. She calls back a few minutes later:\n\n**$me:** OTS Helpdesk how may I help you?  \n**$bitch:** See?! This is the number I'm supposed to call, I call the main line and it says press 3 to speak to a rep... (she gets quieter here, I suspect she realizes her error)... and then says \"press 7 for all other questions to speak to the helpdesk!\"  \n**$me:** Ma'am you need to speak to a representative, this is the IT Helpdesk, we assist with *technical* issues, the call center handles department numbers.  \n**$bitch:** \\*Insert more scoffs and pissy noises.*\\ You dumb as fuck!\n\nShe hangs up again, this time she has yet to call back. We get at least one of these calls a month and it makes this job that much more stressful when people act like entitled cunts like this. What gives you the right to be pissy at *me* when I'm just doing my job and directing you to where you need to go to accomplish the task you're trying to? Just because *you* made the error does not mean that you can take it out on *me*. That makes you an asshole.\n\nTBF, our recorded line *does* say for all other questions contact the helpdesk, which needs to be changed to eliminate confusion like that. I immediately went to my boss to ask if we can get that changed to something more like \"For *technical* assistance...\" But once you call us the first time and get told the proper procedure you have no reason to go and fall for it again, if you do that's *your* fault.",

Every summer we had high school students work for us in a kind of paid internship program, though in reality the student workers mostly performed grunt labor that the regular techs didn't want to do. This particular story takes place on a sunny July day. A pack of 4 student workers are set up at a long makeshift workbench imaging new workstations all day - I'll admit it wasn't the most exciting job - and I'm nearby to keep an eye on them and help if needed. They should all know how to plug in keyboard, mouse, monitor, and network - I mean it's not like they can plug into the wrong port, right?\n\n\nMe: ::Spider sense tingling:: Check on students to find them all huddled around one system, removing hardware.\n\n&gt;Me: Hey, what's going on?\n\n&gt;Stu: This computer is bad, we think it needs a new motherboard.\n\n\nNot entirely unheard of, but unusual that we receive a DOA product.\n\n\n&gt;Me: That's weird, what makes you think it's the motherboard?\n\n&gt;Stu: One of the USB ports doesn't work. We've tried a keyboard and a mouse in this port and neither work, but they work in all the other USB ports.\n\n&gt;Me: Ok, that's decent troubleshooting, I can follow your logic. Let me take a look....Well there's your problem, that's not a USB port. You have the mouse plugged into the ethernet port.\n\n\nThat's the day that I stopped believing any monkey could plug in a computer because the cables can really only fit into their own ports. I was also surprised that I hadn't ever run into this before, I had no idea a standard USB was the same width as RJ45.\n\n\nTLDR: USB devices don't work if you plug them into an ethernet port.\n\n\n\n\nEdit:: De-Yoda my TLDR - Thanks /u/ButtahmilkOG",

Not just because they value IT-related things, but sometimes they come up with solutions that I'd never think of.  \n\nMy employer decided on developing the software they need completely in-house. The system I inherited (classic ASP, MS Access) was in a pretty bad state when I started here, so a lot of my co-workers (who do the actual work that keeps the company running) are used to search for solutions by thinking out of the box. This is a rather short one when we were having some issues with a RaspberryPi/HDMI-screen/IP-cam combination.  \n\nBasically what would happen at random intervals, was that the raspberry pi would reboot, with some environment variables changing, and then after booting up the screen would display upside down. I spent some time trying to fix this issue, but failed at doing so. Following conversation occurred right when I came in on a monday morning. *Edit: rephrased this sentence a bit because the original sounded negative.

We just turned the screen upside down to fix it.\n\nThe screen was mounted to a sort of stand and it was easy for them to flip the screen upside down. This fixed the whole issue.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7hg6mv/server_whisperer_raid5_2_disks_offline_no_backups/",
        "text": "Background: about a decade in IT support - networks, hardware, software. I have worked for different companies that provide IT support to other companies.\n\nDisclosure: English is not my first language, so there probably are mistakes. If the mistakes bother you, please point them out, I will try to correct them.\n\nIt was a nice Friday morning, I had just had my first coffee when a call came in - the Client was unable to send e-mails. Remote troubleshooting showed that the server was down, so I was dispatched to the site.\n\nFirst look at the server and my heart sank - two disks (out of four) had the fault LED on. I quickly called my office to find out where the backups are. There were none.\n\nThe client was fairly new and we were still in the process of handover from the previous support company. It turned out they never got the tape drive working and we were just starting to implement a new backup process. A new tape drive was ordered and it arrived the same day, ironically.\n\nThe clients contact person probably saw the despair in my face and asked how fsck-ed they were (she actually used the F-bomb). Well, take a guess. The RAID array was level 5, so 2 failed disks usually means a total loss of the data. And they ran everything on that server - e-mails, file shares, directory services, accounting software. I told her not to get the hopes up, but I will do everything I can to get their data back. But also they can all go home, because it's going to take at least the weekend.\n\nI hauled the server to my office and started with the recovery process. \n\nFirst things first. I connected the disks to our backup system (a PC we used to back up clients disks before wipe or clean install). We had a recovery software that was able to recognize the RAID structure and I was able to recover most of the data (some files were corrupted, naturally). It was at that point I realized that one of the failed disks was still accessible. Now I had to figure out how to repair the RAID. I had recovered most of the data, but wouldn't it be cool to get the server working again, instead of rebuilding the whole infrastructure? And with the rebuild I would have to wipe the disks anyway, so I could not make the situation worse than it already was.\n\nI stuck the disks back into the server and started the RAID configuration utility. It showed 2 disks as normal, one disk failed and one disk offline. The built-in utility was useless, there was no option to tell the controller to take the disk online again. \n\nAfter practicing some Google-fu I found a bootable image of the more advanced RAID utility (funny thing was - the server was HP, the utility was from IBM, but it was able to manage the controller just fine, because the RAID controller was from the same manufacturer). So using that utility I managed to convince the controller to take the disk back online and crossing the fingers I rebooted the server. And it booted. The operating system complained that the previous shutdown was not clean, but after checking the disk it started without further issues. \n\nThe e-mail database was corrupted (it was expected), so I spent a few hours running the e-mail database repair tool, after that the e-mail server started working again.\n\nThe server didn't leave my sight until the RAID was resynced, the new tape drive installed and the first full backup finished.\n\nThe whole process took 2 days, but in the end everything worked. Later they found a few corrupted files on the file shares and a few broken e-mails on the e-mail server, but it was nothing compared to the total loss of the data.\n\nI wasn't entirely sure why the second drive went offline. My theory was that it got depressed by the death of its neighbour.\n\nTL;DR - Have you backed up your data recently?\n\nNo? Go and back up your data NOW!\n\nYes? Have you checked the backup recently? No? Go and check your backups NOW!\n\nEdit: improved wording, thanks /u/mulldoon1997",

I can add it back on for you if you'd like, and just because you had to call in today, I can offer it to you at HP (shamelessly attempting to get sales points).\n\nCust: Yea, go ahead. Turn it back on.\n\nMe: Perfect, ok so it looks like that will bring your monthly rate t...\n\nCust: *cuts me off \nI'm not talking to you about my bill, you're tech support, you don't know anything about billing.\n\nMe: Well uh Sir, I was actually trained in customer support first but even if I wasn't, I couldn't add this programming without the legal disclosure being read.\n\n*60 seconds of silence\n\nMe: Sir? Did we still want to add this?\n\nCust: Not if you plan on talking to me about money, I'll call back later and talk to a finance officer (what?!?!) just add it so I can watch my show.\n\nMe: Sir, it doesn't work that....\n\n*click\n\n\nI checked this guys account 30 minutes later and he of course called back, this time though he spoke with advanced Tech support, he must have decided to just accept the disclosures because the programming was there.

Our service desk is an offsite support for several other companies, and we have onsite support at those companies which fix issues that require, well... onsite support. I don't believe this is the stupidest case I'll ever handle (thankfully there isn't anything as stupid as this since). \n\nI received a call from a user who was having trouble logging in one fine morning. I ran through all the necessary checks with him, and everything appeared to be working properly. He didn't get any error messages when he tried to log in either, so I asked him to restart his computer to see if that will resolve the issue.\n\nHe *apparently* restarted his computer, and still couldn't log in, so I routed the issue to the onsite engineer to check it out. After about 15 minutes, the onsite engineer got back to me. The guy didn't even connect his monitor to the ~~CPU~~ **computer**. So he wasn't seeing any error messages at all because he was STARING AT A BLANK SCREEN. \n\nMoral of the story: assume all users are blind unless proven otherwise. ",

        "text": "So I used to be an IT installation engineer for the council of a large UK town four years ago, which eventually became essentially third line support. The secretary of a VIP had a couple of us go over a few times to sort things for herself and the VIP, only, she was very, very picky. This isn't the bulk of the story, but it sets us up for the remark to come.\n\nSo myself and this pretty conservative older guy who's more a handiman than an IT tech go over to fit a phone, upgrade her screen, all that jazz. She'd been very specific with what she wanted, when she wanted it, and not especially polite at that point. \n\nSo cue tuts and groans from us when she wasn't there at the right time. The people around her 'cube' told us she'd be gone for the next couple of hours, and had locked her door as she went.\n\nWe head back over to our building, at that point due to be demolished as it had been replaced by the new offices necessitating our work. The only people in there are the IT team and a caretaker, who spent his days at the main desk either watching TV or sleeping.\n\nThe guy I want over with is pretty irked by this point, and starts ranting to the caretaker. I'm mildly annoyed but don't really care, but I'm happy to agree with his complaints.\n\nThat is, until we're about to head upstairs, and he shouts to the caretaker with definite vitriol and not the slightest hint of intended 'humour': \"She needs a good raping!\"",

        "text": "So I have a new starter on Monday. He's requested an Ubuntu desktop so, on Tuesday with nothing else to do, I set one up for him. This was a few days after our seemingly monthly desk reshuffle. This gives the team he's joining the necessary space to accommodate him.\n\nAs a result of the desk move, screens are now in very random places as we have some empty desks. After moving the stragglers into place, I grab the first new screen in my pile. Well, technically not the first - we have a single spare 32\" 4k screen. They've become a bit desirable since the standard 34\" curved monitors are much lower resolution (3440x1440 irrc). As the 4k screen has been used for events and such, it's been in and out of its box so many times the cardboard padding is ruined so I'm keen to put it into service, so I allocate it to the new guy and put it on his desk.\n\nCome Friday afternoon, I receive an instant message from the head of the team the new guy will be joining:\n\n&gt;$teamlead: hey, you know $otherdev is stealing the screen you set aside for $newguy?\n\nI spin around and sure enough, $otherdev is carrying his curved monitor back to $newguy's desk. Astonished, I walk over there as he sets the monitor down.\n\nAmusingly, my BOfH-wannabe attitude appears to be working. No sooner do I approach than another member of the team hands me a Nerf gun...\n\nSure enough, the computer that I rigged up days in advance has been completely unplugged. I am very annoyed and tell $otherdev to get lost (with persuasion from the Nerf gun...). He's made no effort to switch any cables over and instead was going to leave the screen on the desk unconnected. After getting rid of him, I set the machine up again.\n\nNow, I have no specific objections to people swapping monitors around - I have also traded my curved for a 4k so it would be hypocritical to say no. Although I like to play the BOfH, I don't want to look like I'm an obstruction or give management any reason to impose limits on my authority. The company is still very small and people managed their own hardware before I joined, but I've been there 3 months now. However, interfering with my setups without asking is a big no-no in my book. I pre-built the new guy's machine in case I can't get in on time on Monday morning (buses are unreliable around here and many others have trouble).\n\nAfter reassembling the machine, I ask $otherdev why he took it upon himself to do this without asking me. I'm slightly floored by his answer.\n\n&gt;$otherdev: it didn't look like the screen was in use, so I just took it.\n\n&gt;$me: and you didn't think to ask *any of the surrounding people* if the desk was set up for anyone, say for **Monday morning**??\n\n&gt;$otherdev: &lt;no answer&gt;\n\nI was able to end with some BOfH-ness though, some karma :) While I'm digging through my cable boxes to set the screen up (again), $otherdev walks over rather meekly.\n\n&gt;$otherdev: so I was using HDMI... and HDMI only supports a 30Hz refresh rate at 4k... so...\n\n&gt;$me: oh, you mean you need one of these USB-C to DisplayPort cables? &lt;holds one up&gt;\n\n&gt;$me: &lt;immediately shuts and locks the cupboard and walks away&gt;\n\nHe did get his cable, in the end... and a talking-to from the project manager about taking things without asking ;)",

We got Access!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/708mxo/why_use_sql_we_got_access/)\n\n_________________________________\n\nThe characters:\n\n$boss: 30ish woman, and man, could she be a dragon. (A nice one, but still a dragon.)\n\n$coworker: nice 40ish go-to-woman. Got a question? Ask $coworker. Biggest help on my project so far.\n\n$bigBoss: the uber-boss. 40-something, comes from Greece, has an accent and is chilled like no-one I've ever met.\n\n$ITwannabe: The IT guru. Though how much he actually did in IT and programming, I never found out. Was not much, that I can tell.\n________________\n\nAfter the whole debacle of the last part, I try my best to salvage what I can. I use the next two weeks to read into everything I can relating to Access and server issues. I get the bright idea to move the database to Sharepoint in hopes of having a better data connection; it also actually works! Problem is, since we only have Sharepoint 2011 (or something, not too sure about it anymore) and should have upgraded to Sharepoint 2016 about a month ago, it completely destroys all the links and correlations made in the DB itself. So no more linked tables, but just plain tables. Can't work with that, sadly.\n\nI do not hear from $boss anymore which makes me quite nervous. She just comes in from time to time to ask how I am doing, I tell her that I am working on a solution though I have no idea how to make the app running world wide, she nods and goes on her merry way.\n\nA few days later, I have a meeting with $bigBoss. We talk, I explain what went wrong, he just says that he has no idea what I am talking about anyway and that I just should keep on trying. (He was really sympathetic about it, telling me not to worry since I seemingly am in over my head and that technically it is the fault of $boss for hiring someone not suited for the job.)\n\nWhile I go through the corridors to get me some more coffee, one day I spy $ITwannabe in a room. With a video camera. And a lot of people. And some billboards which have his project name printed on them. Next time I meet him, I ask what this is all about and he tells me:\n\n&gt; $ITwannabe: Oh, we were just doing some demonstration tapes for our cloud solution.\n\nSo much for having no time for me. He has enough time to make some f-ing videos, for Pete's sake.\n\nSo, finally, I give up. I cannot make this Access app work world wide, no chance in hell - at least not in this last month I am with $company, and no way in same hell I will keep working here, not after failing that much and having to work around obstacles constantly.\n\nI finally meet $ITwannabe in a good mood and try for some last hitch to get my car on the road.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Hey $ITwannabe! May I have some of your time?\n\n&gt; $ITwannabe: Sure, spill it.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Guess you heard about my project having failed?\n\n&gt; $ITwannabe: (with an evil smile) Told you not to work with $boss.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Not that I had any say in that matter. Anyway, any idea how I can salvage that shit?\n\nAnd this is the point where $ITwannabe became my secret hero. Still do not like him to this day, really, but damn...\n\n&gt; $ITwannabe: Easy. Just say it is a prototype.\n\n&gt; $win4free: ... what?\n\n&gt; $ITwannabe: See, it's like this: You made a mess, and no wonder with what you had to work with, really. $boss needs to save some face for her higher-ups. And, as you know, we are working on a project which is almost the same as yours. So just say that your app is a prototype to find out what your department needed anyway, and integrate all them fields into our software. That's the way it was supposed to go anyway.\n\n&gt; $win4free: ... why did you not tell me that earlier?\n\n&gt; $ITwannabe: Hey, you didn't ask.\n\nGranted, I did not ask. The reason is that he never has been available up to now.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Okay... that just might work. I'll talk with $boss and see what I can do. Thanks!\n\nOff I go to $boss and tell her of my new plan: Get all our fields and data needed over to $ITwannabe and his team, integrate our stuff into their web-based frontend and have him gather all the data I already have and integrate that into the backend. Problem solved!\n\n&gt; $boss: No, not problem solved. We need that NOW.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Yeah, well... but it does not work. I cannot give you \"now\".\n\n&gt; $boss: Then find another solution while you work this thing out with $ITwannabe.\n\nSo, I still try to resurrect the corpse which is my application to make it travel-worthy (of course no chance that that'll happen) while working with $ITwannabe on integrating our stuff into their project. Smooth sailing, to be honest, it works more or less great and after only two weeks, I got almost everything in their cloud solution that I have in my app.\n\nIn comes $boss.\n\n&gt; $boss: Hey $win4free, I just had an idea!\n\n&gt; $win4free: Do tell, I'm all ears.\n\n&gt; $boss: We do it like in the old days! Use Excel!\n\nMy mouth drops open. It remains so for a good minute while $boss stands there, radiating brilliance (in her own mind) and watching me like I would have to praise her in one moment.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Excel?\n\n&gt; $boss: Yeah! Just get the customer/project correlations onto Excel, we can send them out to our guys and they'll fill it out and send it back once a month!\n\n&gt; $win4free: What about all that customer data...?\n\n&gt; $boss: Oh, that's not that important anyway.\n\nFive minutes later I am smoking three to four cigarettes every five minutes in our smoker breakroom while trying to keep myself under control. I replay it in my mind time and time again.\n\n*Oh, customer data is not that important anyway.*\n\n*Not that important.*\n\n*Anyway.*\n\nI want to cry. I really do. What have I been doing this last half year? Building something which, for the largest part, was not needed anyway? Are you f-ing kidding me? And now **Excel?!**\n\nI give up. It is only two to three more weeks I have to endure this, and then I am off, contracts finished, I am out.\n\nLet's do some Excel.\n\nI rebuild the matrix my Greek emperor dragon likes so much in Excel. I get a spreadsheet for every customer, sorted by countries; I copy what I have on correlating data regarding projects. I build one \"admin Excel sheet\" which has all spreadsheets of all countries in it and has a button with which you can select the files, and it copies their contents to the right spreadsheet.\n\nIt is a work done in about one week and a half.\n\n$boss is overjoyed.\n\n$bigBoss has his matrix and therefore is happy.\n\n$ITwannabe has our fields and data now in his application, as much as he can put in since they too are nearing their deadline.\n\n$coworker just laughs all the time, either out of desperation or because she just cannot fathom how f-ed up all this is.\n\nI got almost a thousand bucks (with no taxes, even!) a month for making a \"prototype\" and in the end, changing to Excel.\n\nWhen my contract runs out and I am on my last day of work, $boss meets me in my work space.\n\n&gt; $boss: Hey $win4free! Say, would you like us to continue your contract? Work another half year here with us?\n\nI look at $coworker, who smirks. I think about all the shit I have done which, in the end, and probably to no small part to my own incompetence, did not matter at all.\n\n&gt; $win4free: No, thanks.\n\nAnd I run to freedom.\n_________________________\n\nThat's it, folks! Some last information:\n\nThe reason $boss had so many meetings was that the department was way behind with their numbers. They apparently tried to hide the fact that they made almost no new contracts in the complete year of 2016 and therefore went straight from black  to almost red numbers.\n\nThree weeks ago, it was announced that $company would sell the complete sector that department was based in. So, $coworker would (probably) never have to work with $boss again, and since all that had been an open secret in the department itself, quite a lot of people tried to find a new job while the inevitable was approaching.\n\nDon't know much about what happened to $bigBoss, but I sure hope he's doing okay.\n\n$ITwannabe finally managed to roll out his three-year-project and it worked... to a certain degree. Apparently, having a cloud service provider as your data, frontend AND backend manager was not that good of an idea. (They just wrote to said provider what they needed and trusted that they'd do it - till they found out that they requested the impossible.)\n\nI went on studying, failed and now am doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development. I get to work with people who know their stuff and gladly share it with me, and just last week, I finally found out how to size a server appropriately. I've also never touched Access again to this day.\n\nI learned a lot in those months. How to not start a project; how to not hope for the best; how to make sure your ass is covered. It tremendously helped me in my later life and I guess I can say that I'm all that wiser, now.\n\nHope you enjoyed the story! If you have any questions, I'll gladly answer them. And to my \"colleagues\" (since I don't count myself to them) who are in a similar situation I say: Hang in there. Some time in the future, after all the frustration and anger is gone, you'll laugh about it - as did I.\n\nCheers!",

Not a bad assumption. I was listening to crackly call recordings through one shitty, tinny-sounding earbud at the time and every other noise was kind of a background wash. I could *not* have heard that right.\n\nBut no. No, that was in fact a sentence that was said. I turned around and hardly needed to ask to confirm. $Dani and $Manny - my fellow tech and our direct supervisor, respectively - looked about as dumbfounded as I felt.\n\nI asked anyway. Too surreal.\n\n&gt; $Quill: \\*earbud yank* Sorry, did you just say someone *melted* a monitor?\n&gt; \n&gt; $Manny: \\*patented \"losing faith in humanity again\" sigh*\n&gt; \n&gt; $Dani: \\*flatly* With a toaster.

What else would you ever do with a toaster, right? And hey, her cubicle, her rules. Why should she not tote a kitchen appliance all the way to work to wedge onto an already overcrowded desk? Who wants to wait five extra minutes in the morning to eat at home when you could do it from the comfort of your shared administrative office space? Sure there's one in the break room, but that's a *public* toaster used by god-knows-which-coworker. Besides which, it's all the way down the hall. Toaster on desk. That makes so much more sense.\n\nI saw the aftermath a few hours later - $Dani had refrained from slapping the user, but very pointedly said nothing the entire time she was collecting the poor mangled electronics. The monitor, as it turned out, had not melted, but the heat had turned most of the screen white. The cables were fine, never got word on whether the mouse still worked, but the keyboard was toast (pun intentional, I'm not sorry). The spacebar was drooping. There were tiny little puddles of plastic underneath and several of the bottom row letters were all warped to shit. It looked like Salvador Dali had tried his hand at sculpting and abandoned the project halfway through.\n\nThis is an educational institution, guys. She shoved a toaster under her monitor and in front of her keyboard and proceeded to make a bagel and walk away. It happened a couple months ago now and I've told the story to a good handful of friends and family members; I'm still bewildered.\n\nTL;DR: Keyboards melt like candle wax.",

        "text": "Hey all, been a while since I last posted on here!\n\nFollowing my [last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/74grxd/you_want_help_fine_just_be_polite/) I spoke about some [dead swans](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/74grxd/you_want_help_fine_just_be_polite/dny9qli/) and people were asking about it. Now that I have a bit of a break, I'm in the mood to share my story with you guys and gals.\n\n***\n\nIt's a cloud afternoon in August and **$natfan** has only been working at the IT Support role for a few weeks. So I was on the NUR (New, Updated &amp; Reopened) ticket queue trying to answer questions as quickly as possible or assign them off to the correct department if needs be, when I stumbled across my favourite ticket to date. It was from **$user**, a member of the public who emailing our `webmaster@domain.com` address. Now, us getting emails is no big deal. Most people don't even know that we have a front-facing support portal for staff and students to submit their queries properly, so about 85-90% of our tickets are sent to us via email. Most people email us at `it@domain.com` or our older email before a rebrand that happened before our time `its-help@domain.com`. In all my months on the server desk, I've only ever seen one (human) email sent to the `webmaster@domain.com` address. This was the second thing that struck me as odd, the first being the subject.\n\n\"**Swans**\"\n\nThe ticket was as follows:\n\n***\n\n&gt; Sender: `u@hotmail.com`\n&gt;\n&gt; To: `webmaster@domain.com`\n&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Swans\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello, I noticed yesterday that one of the swans on the lake was apparently dead, floating in the water. Does the university have any person who is responsible for looking after the swans?\n&gt;\n&gt;I often see dog walkers who let their dogs off the lead near the lake, and people who are able to feed the swans indiscriminately.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; U\n&gt;\n&gt; Sent from my iPad\n\n***\n\nObviously, I had no clue what to do with this so I just stood up and asked my colleagues in the front row:\n\n**$natfan**: Uhh, guys... Do IT deal with dead swans on campus?\n\n**$colleauges**: *a collective \"I'm sorry, what\" descended over the Service Desk*\n\n**$natfan**: Yeah, there's a guy here saying that there's a dead swan and he emailed it to \"`webmaster@domain.com`\", of all places.\n\nEveryone went quiet for a few moments before erupting into laughter. Obviously, there were many one liners to be said so I'll list the top three below:\n\n* \"I guess he sent it to `webmaster@domain.com` because swans have webbed feet.\n* Have you tried turning it off and swan again?\n* ERROR 404: SWAN NOT FOUND\n\nEventually we passed it on to `Estates and Facilities`, as they're probably the best to deal with this type of issue. I've never heard from either the customer or E&amp;F again about this issue, so hopefully they were removed and given a [21-gun salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21-gun_salute) in honour of the Queen and all that jazz.\n\nEvery now and again someone tries to top my ticket, but in my book, not much can get better than a dead swan being reported to IT. Whenever any asks me what I do for a living I say \"IT at &lt;universityName&gt;, also I dispose of dead swans now and again\".\n\nI have a few other stories to tell, but this one is the most animal related one yet!\n\n**EDIT I**: Fixed grammar and one of the puns we made.",

We got Access!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/708mxo/why_use_sql_we_got_access/)\n\n_________________________________\n\nThe characters:\n\n$boss: 30ish woman, and man, could she be a dragon. (A nice one, but still a dragon.)\n\n$coworker: nice 40ish go-to-woman. Got a question? Ask $coworker. Biggest help on my project so far.\n\n$ITwannabe: The IT guru. Though how much he actually did in IT and programming, I never found out. Was not much, that I can tell.\n\n$CiK: Also known as \"my contact in (South) Korea\". Nice man, did overtime for my sake and regrettably it did not matter at all.\n\n$extIT: External IT service guy for my company. For one that big, you should think they do that stuff themselves; since shareholders somehow found out IT is expensive, they do not anymore.\n________________\n\nThe email flood vanishes almost overnight. Like Noah with his ark seeing the dove with its stick, I judge the absence of further emails as a sign from the IT gods that I finally have their blessing and can continue with my work. By now - which is about another two weeks later - the application finally is taking shape in UI references as well as functionality. I got everything in there I want to: the connections between projects and customers can be established with a few easy clicks, the results are shown in a way I can live with - it was not beautiful, but you could see all the relevant information on a glance. Every other part of the project and / or customer can be found too, every little detail $boss totally wanted in there is in there and can be configured right in the application, and I even got around to some security stuff, like editing rights through user groups.\n\nIn other words: I think I am finished with this part. Finally. This is, all in all, about four to five months in. (I cannot really remember, it was quite some time ago now and seriously, I tried to forget most of it.)\n\nWhat I am missing right now is a server; I was told someone (that someone being $ITwannabe, so no one really) would find one for me in the company since they have \"no own IT\". (What the hell am I doing here, then, you might ask? Heck if I know.)\n\nSo, it is time for testing.\n\n$coworker, may the IT gods always hold their hands over her and protect her from the fiery fire of $boss (which indeed they did - but in another way she probably liked), makes a few calls. We get people from around Germany hook up, send them the frontend application all ready and configured, and they try it.\n\nIt works. Not like a charm - the backend still sits on my laptop which is not a piece of crap, but very close to it, and my internet connection is not all that nice either - but it f-ing works. I am thrilled, as is $coworker. We both go over to $boss to bring her the good news, since $coworker has always been there for me if I had a problem, and I want to share this little victory with her.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Hey $boss, good news! First testing seems fine. As soon as we get a server for the backend, the application can officially be rolled out!\n\n&gt; $boss: Very nice! Get to it! Oh, hey $coworker, you need something?\n\n&gt; $coworker: (looks at me a bit uncertain) Um, no. Just wanted to come with $win4free, really. We worked on this together, after all.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Yah, couldn't have done it without her -\n\n&gt; $boss: Very nice, I'm sure. Well, I gotta go, another meeting, ta!\n\nAnd off she goes. I shit you not, that happened exactly like described.\n\nWe go back to our workstations a bit deflated. But hey, we got the app running! Time to get that backend to where it belongs.\n\n$coworker spends the next complete week trying to find a server in our company premises without consorting to our external IT services. She knows they suck, I know it (since I actually worked for them about two years earlier until I dropped out because I was a lazy piece of shit... and probably still am) and our goal right now is to find someone with a server and a little \"spare room\" on it so we can squeeze in there. Apparently, that is the way they do stuff around here.\n\nAfter that week, which I spend with a little bug fixing and UI redecoration, we come up with nothing. Crap. Time to call that external IT service.\n\n&gt; $extIT: Good morning, this is $externalITService, how may I help you today?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Hey, this is $win4free with $company. I need a server for my little baby database here. Something low-scale really, it won't be needed all that much and we can afford to have people wait a few seconds for their results.\n\nNot my words, mind you. $boss has a tight budget, at least she told me that.\n\n&gt; $extIT: Sure thing! Can you give me any specifications for the server you need?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Something with at least 32GB RAM, a decent CPU and a 1TB hard drive would probably do, really. If it has a bit more, I wouldn't be mad, mind you.\n\n&gt; $extIT: Okay, nice! We can have that installed in at least 4 to 6 weeks.\n\nI almost spill my coffee over that.\n\n&gt; $win4free: (coughing) Sorry, excuse me, did you say *4 to 6 weeks?!*\n\n&gt; $extIT: Yeah... I'm sorry, but we have a lot of contracts right now, and although your company has a VIP status, it'll take us some time to scrounge up the hardware.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Okay... well, if there is no other way... how much will it cost?\n\n&gt; $extIT: Oh, something above 10.000€, but not too much above that. Per month.\n\nCue the second coughening. I hate it when I got coffee on my table, but in this case, I just cannot help myself.\n\n&gt; $win4free: HOW MUCH?!\n\n&gt; $extIT: Um... yeah, about that much. That's standard.\n\n&gt; $win4free: I'm asking for what is essentially a 300€ computer plugged in to some decent internet, and you want to charge my department five figures for that?!\n\n&gt; $extIT: Well... yeah.\n\n&gt; $win4free: (breathing heavy because of loss of coffee and, apparently, sense) Okay, thanks. I'll talk with my boss.\n\nI hang up. $coworker sees my face and immediately becomes concerned about my well-being.\n\n&gt; $coworker: Everything's all right?\n\n&gt; $win4free: No. Nothing is.\n\nOff I go to see $boss. Time to find out how hot that fire really is. Lucky for me, I find her in a good mood. Unlucky for me, I also find out why.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Hey, $boss -\n\n&gt; $boss: Hey! Just the man I wanted to talk to! $bigBoss really is excited about the application you build! Is it ready to roll out now?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Um, yeah, about that -\n\n&gt; $boss: And have you tested it with other countries already?\n\nI am taken aback. Other countries? Tested with? Wha?\n\n&gt; $win4free: ... what other countries?\n\n&gt; $boss: We got some people in Spain, England, the US, South Korea... they need to work with the app! You know that! (laughing)\n\n&gt; $win4free: (not even cracking a smile) No, I don't. You never told me.\n\n&gt; $boss: What? Of course I did, it is in the mails we exchanged in the beginning -\n\n&gt; $win4free: No, it isn't. There is nothing about going world wide with this app. Nothing. Not a single thing.\n\n&gt; $boss: Now look, I distinctly remember I've put it in there -\n\n&gt; $win4free: Shall we check?\n\nNow she is pissed, because I keep interrupting her little monologue. But to be honest? At this point, I don't give a single fuck anymore.\n\n&gt; $boss: No, no time for that. It's your job, just make it happen.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Can't.\n\n&gt; $boss: What do you mean, you can't?\n\n&gt; $win4free: 'Cause of Access. It's not designed to go world wide. It's not even designed to go Germany wide if you get my drift. It's usually used in a single environment like a warehouse, not country wide.\n\n&gt; $boss: You never told me that!\n\n&gt; $win4free: You told me that it would be deployed in Germany. I can work with that. I cannot do world wide.\n\n&gt; $boss: And how do you know that?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Because I read it in the documentation.\n\n&gt; $boss: Nonsense! Just try it, will you? I got a man in South Korea, he'll be your test partner. Gotta go now, another meeting, ta!\n\nShe has a lot of meetings, now. I don't know what that really is about, but I have a feeling. Rumor is that our department is not doing well at all (I could tell you some juicy stories about that, but confidentiality bars the way) and I guess she is pulling some strings now for the worst case.\n\nThe next day, I have a phone number and some instructions on my table. The instructions are: call before 0800 hours or the man in South Korea is already gone to sleep. Also his email address, to which I immediately send the frontend. Then I call the number.\n\n&gt; $CiK: Evening.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Hey, this is $win4free with $company, I was told by $boss to call you for some testing of our new application?\n\n&gt; $CiK: Oh hey! Nice to hear from you, and you're lucky, I was just about to leave!\n\n&gt; $win4free: Well, no worries, I'll try to keep this quick. In my opinion, this is a huge mistake, anyway.\n\n&gt; $CiK: Um, what makes you say that?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Because I have to use Microsoft Access for this.\n\nCue heartfelt groan on the end of the line.\n\n&gt; $CiK: Why in the seven hells would you do that?\n\n&gt; $win4free: Not my choice, guv. Anyway, you should have an email with the frontend all ready and configured. Could you just try to launch it and see how fast it is with the data transfer from here to you?\n\n&gt; $CiK: Sure, gimme a sec...\n\nHe opens the application. The first thing after starting it is a welcome screen with a little drop down menu in which you select the customer you want to see, or a button which sends you straight to the projects. He clicks on the drop down menu.\n\n&gt; $win4free: And...?\n\n&gt; $CiK: Still waiting.\n\n&gt; $win4free: (after one minute) How about now?\n\n&gt; $CiK: Nope, still waiting. How long you figure this is gonna take?\n\n&gt; $win4free: I bet you five bucks that it'll be five minutes.\n\n&gt; $CiK: You're on. I say it'll be ten.\n\nWe wait some more, talk about life in South Korea and how the things are back home. He is a really nice guy, and after hearing that $boss made me use Access, he starts his monologue about how I should have stood up to good programming and common sense as well.\n\n&gt; $CiK: So yeah, no one uses Access for stuff like that, and good riddance to that, too - oh wait, it's finished! The drop down menu is up!\n\n&gt; $win4free: (looks at the clock) Seven minutes. Guess we both lost.\n\n&gt; $CiK: Guess I won't have to tell you that this is not acceptable?\n\n&gt; $win4free: What, really? (laughing)\n\n&gt; $CiK: Anyway, nice talking with you, give my regards to $boss and her shitty choices. I'll be in tomorrow at about the same time if you need me.\n\n&gt; $win4free: Thank you very much, and have a good night.\n\nI hit off an email to $boss saying what I told her before: No way we can make this work. I also include the part about the five figures server. Done everything I can considering this particular problem, I go back to bug fixing.\n\nA few minutes later, $boss is in my room.\n\n&gt; $boss: This is un-ac-cep-tab-le!\n\n&gt; $win4free: Oh, hey boss.\n\n&gt; $boss: Seven minutes to open a drop down menu? You must be joking!\n\n&gt; $win4free: Nope. No jokes intended. I told you that Access cannot work overseas, let alone to the neighbouring country.\n\n&gt; $boss: But you told me -\n\n&gt; $win4free: I told you *nothing*. YOU told me to use Access, and I told you that this is a bad idea, especially after I read into it. You said to go ahead, and I did.\n\n&gt; $boss: But...\n\n&gt; $win4free: No \"buts\". It can't be done. End of line.\n\nAnd then, something remarkable happens. $boss gives me a long look, as she does to $coworker. And then she leaves.\n\n$coworker and I look at each other.\n\n&gt; $win4free: I think I broke her.\n\n&gt; $coworker: (with a little smile) Well done.\n\n__________________________\n\nThanks for reading!

        "text": "Good afternoon TFTS I have another tech tale to share. \n\nYesterday the electricity went out due to high winds in my area. We usually have generators where I work but those failed for some reason. This caused a few problems with our users but nonetheless wasn't overwhelming. I get an email from this office worker saying that neither her laptop or computer will turn on. She thinks it might have to do with the power being out but wants me to give her a call. I gave her a ring and she sounded very frustrated, we'll call her \"frusty\"\n\n&gt;$me: Hi, this is $me from IT, I saw in your email that you're having issues with your computer?\n\n&gt;$frusty: Hi! YES, my computer will not turn on and neither will my laptop. I've been trying to get work done all morning can you please help?\n\n&gt;$me: Sure of course, let me get a little more detail from you, when you turn it on does any type of light emanate from the machine itself indicating that its indeed on?\n\n&gt;$frusty: yes the power button is blue and I hear it turning on but the screen is still blank\n\n&gt;$me:....can we please confirm that the monitor is turned on?\n\n&gt;$frusty: yes yes but the power light is orange. \n\n&gt;$me: okay before I come take a look can you please check the so-\n\n&gt;$frusty: LOOK, i don't have time for this, can we do this later? I need to get to work!\n\n&gt;$me: Oh, okay, but don't you need your comput-\n\n&gt;$frusty: YES but listen I'm not a tech, you are, please come look at this promptly *click*\n\nSo I make my 20 minute journey over to that building to see what is going on. Once I get into the office there is \"Frusty\" repeatedly pushing the power button on her laptop while swearing under her breath.\n\n&gt;$frusty: you're here, can you please look at my laptop first before that computer?\n\nI take a look at her laptop, press the power button, no go. I see her charger plugged in the side and notice that its slightly pulled out, so I give it a small push and tada it powers on. \n\n&gt;$frusty: oh you fixed it, great! can you check that computer out now? I tried turning it off and on several times\n\nI take one look at the monitor and press source, the monitor switches to VGA and it pops on.\n\n&gt;$frusty: great you fixed it, what was the problem with them?\n\n&gt;$me: your laptop charger wasn't fully plugged in and your monitor didn't have the correct source, have a nice day\n\nI walked out as she slammed her head on her desk...\n\njust kidding, she just said \"thanks\" in a snotty way as she logged into her laptop. \n\n\n",

        "text": "So…  This just happened, as I was writing my other story for today.  I don’t usually share stories from my current job, this one is the exception.\n\nRecently one of our offices received new computers; 12.5” notebooks and 12.5” convertible hybrids.\n\nA user walks in with a laptop that is in two pieces.  He explains that his convertible (the kind that is a tablet with an attachable keyboard) is broken.  As I come to the realization that I issued this user a notebook, NOT a convertible, he drops the device on my desk.  (That’s right; he somehow tore the lid from the base of the notebook thinking that he got a convertible.)  I tell him that this wasn’t a convertible, it was a notebook.  It WAS a notebook, now it’s a paperweight.  Somehow this is beyond his comprehension.  His response was that his other coworker got a convertible and that no one told him his wasn’t so he thought it was stuck and he need to pull harder.  I ask him how hard he pulled and if that didn’t give him some indication that it was not a convertible, I receive a blank stare in return.\n\nAfter some back and forth, I asked him to leave my office.  I could not take it anymore; I did not want to lose my composure.  On his way out of my office, he asks when he will get a replacement.\n\nI take this to my boss, who asks me how long it will take to fix and when can I get this user a replacement.  He apparently sees nothing wrong with this situation.  I am giving this user the biggest heaviest laptop I have.\n\nThis is why I drink.\n",

        "text": "Many years ago, I was an Air Force avionics technician.  I had some very interesting experiences while in uniform, some of them I can even share with all of you.  \n\nOne of the especially fun (read: not at all fun) times on the flightline was when we had an emergency inspection or aircraft change to do on a schedule.  Lots of panic and stress, not a lot of reason is usually involved.  In this case, I was opening up a panel on the backbone of the jet to look at a connector for corrosion and repairing it if identified.  This would have been an easy job to do on day shift or inside a hangar.  I was not so lucky.\n\nAs per usual night shift etiquette, our truck driver would shout out someone’s name with a creative string of profanity and their assignment.  Then we grab our tools and go out to the assigned jet.  \n\nOn this particular night, we were shorthanded and exceptionally busy.  This meant that jobs that are usually handled by 2 or more people were one man jobs.  When the string of profanity with my name and assignment was called, I got the worst gig of the night.  Three jets to do the panel inspection on.  This required me to climb up to the wing on a stand, and then attach one part of the safety line that I did not trust to be all that safe to the jet while walking the backbone to the forward point to attach my harness.  Then squat down, open a panel, check this connector and seal the panel back up.\n\nAs stated before, this job would be really easy in the daylight on a warm day.  It was 1am and below zero on this day and unsurprisingly, a little frosty.  As I walk up to my jet, I utter my own string of profanity and prepare to work.  This is going to be a long night, a very long and very cold night.\n\n45 minutes of prep later, I climb my jet at the wing root and latch in.  My balls are already chaffing due to the harness.  I climb up on the backbone and start my work.  The panel was opened without difficulty.  As with the others I have done, no corrosion found (thankfully).  I didn’t even strip out or drop any of the 30+ screws on this panel.\n\nI reach for the panel to put the sealant on it before mounting it and the wind blows.  I fell off the backbone of the jet, thankfully my safety line stops me (kind of) and I don’t become a red splatter FOD hazard on the pavement.\n\nThere I hang, 7 feet off the ground, unable to disengage my harness due to the weight on it and I have no radio to call for help.  Just hanging out.  3 hours later, still hanging, my truck arrives and it takes 30 minutes of laughing at me and 3 mechanics to get my down safely.\n\nLater I got reprimanded for unsafe practices.  The fact that I had no choice does not weigh in on the paperwork or the ass chewing I got.\n",

        "text": "The Baby Bell is a telecom that specializes in apartment complexes and other multi-family residential units.   My normal hours run from 5pm - 2am.\n\n---\n\nIt had been a long, hard, miserable day.  I had dealt with two outages and 15 calls.  One of the calls had lasted upwards of an hour.  We were down a person which meant I had skipped my lunch break and now I was starved.  My shift had exactly one hour left and I was so ready to go home...\n\n30 minutes...  \n15 ...   \nI started packing.   \n10 ... \n\n&gt; **Tier 1:** simAlity....I know you are about to leave but could you take this last call.\n\nI have a policy where tier 1 is concerned.  I look out for them.  They look out for me.  They are my front line.  I am their backup.  In a crisis, they keep the callers away from me so that I can reduce the number of calls coming to them.  We work well together.  So even though it was 10 minutes until 2am there really was only one answer I could give:\n\n&gt; **Me:** Sure, no problem.  \n&gt; **Tier 1:** Thank you so much.  \n\nReaching deep, I summoned my cheerful voice.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Thank you for calling tech support, this is simAlity.  How may I help you?  \n&gt; **Caller:** Yeah, my Internet isn't working and I know it's not because of my equipment.  Everything worked fine yesterday.\n\nHer voice didn't sound as righteous as I was expecting.  Instead there was a note of desperation in her tone.  That's good because it meant she was being sincere but bad because if a fix or a convincing explanation wasn't available, I was in for a long call.\n\nI swapped out my \"cheerful\" voice for my \"concerned maternal\" voice.\n\n&gt; **Me:** Let's back up a bit.  What `exactly` is happening?  \n&gt; **Caller:** My Internet isn't working.  \n&gt; **Me:** Okay and what happens when you try to connect?  \n&gt; **Caller:** It says that I'm connected but there is no Internet.  \n\nA quick check of my backend revealed there was no community wifi where she was calling from.  Therefore she must have brought her own router.\n\n&gt; **Me:** What type of router are you using?  \n&gt; **Caller:** Netgear Nighthawk AC 1900.  I bought it at the beginning of the semester.  \n&gt; **Me:** That's a modem-router combo isn't it?   They generally aren't compatible with our networks.  \n&gt; **Caller** *(defensively)***:** I don't know...it worked fine yesterday.  \n&gt; **Me:** Is there a place to screw in a coax cable?  \n&gt; **Caller:** yes.  \n&gt; **Me** *(gently)***:** Then it's not compatible with our network.  \n&gt; **Caller:** But y'all said it was!  I went to your website and checked to see what modems were compatible with your system and this was on the list.  \n\nThat threw me for a second before I realized that she was calling from one of our contract properties.  Among other things, the Baby Bell accepts contract work from the $BigBell telecoms.  To make a long explanation short, people in various locations call us believing that they are calling the local $BigBell telecom.  Truthfully they are better off with us.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** The modem would be compatible if a modem was required.  But it's not.  Your apartment complex should have explained this to you when you moved in.  \n&gt; **Caller:** But it worked yesterday!!!\n\nThrown again....I asked for a moment to think... what could make a modem work at a place with a switched Ethernet network?  Technically it should be impossible.... unless....? \n\n&gt; **Me:** The only way the Night Hawk could have functioned in even a limited capacity is if you had plugged the LAN cable into one of the network jacks instead of the Internet jack.  But even then you would have needed a separate router in order to have a functional WiFi connection.\n\n&gt; **Caller:**  Maybe like my roommate's router?  \n&gt; **Me:** Exactly.  I take it she took her router back?  \n&gt; **Caller:** yeah...    \n&gt; **Me:** And that's when the Internet stopped working?  \n&gt; **Caller:** uh-huh.  \n&gt; **Me:** I'm so sorry.  \n&gt; **Caller:** So why did it work?  I don't understand.   \n&gt; **Me:** You were funneling your Internet connection through the modem to the router.  The modem was acting as a conduit...but an unnecessary one.  It would have worked just as well if you had simply plugged the LAN cable from the wall to your router.  \n&gt; **Caller:** So there is nothing you can do?  \n&gt; **Me:** Afraid not.  \n&gt; **Caller:** I have homework that I really need to get done tonight.  \n\nCrap.  Now I felt sorry for her.  Not because of her sob story but because her desperation had turned into despondency.  She's really just a young girl who made a mistake.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Do you have a mac or a PC?  \n&gt; **Caller:** Mac.  \n&gt; **Me:** Darn.  There is a way to turn a PC into a router.  Do you have access to a PC?  Even an old one would do.  \n&gt; **Caller:** No.   \n&gt; **Me:** I'm so sorry.   \n&gt; **Caller:** Its OK.  Thank you for explaining this to me.  \n\nShe hung up.  \n\nI looked at the clock.  Only five minutes past my scheduled departure time.  The entire call had taken 15 minutes. \n\n&gt; **Me (to Tier 1):** She's good.  Well...not \"good\".  But settled.  I had to explain that her modem-router wouldn't work.  \n&gt; **Tier 1:** Yeah, we tried to tell her but she didn't believe us.  She demanded to speak to you instead.  \n&gt; **Me:** Don't worry.  It happens. I'm out.  See you guys tomorrow.  \n",

        "text": "Had this happen today and made for an interesting afternoon.\n\nSome specialized industrial printers were ordered and needed to get network access.  So I grab our static IP info, hand it to the install tech, and confirm network connectivity.  Everything seems simple enough but then I notice strange drops from these units.  \n\nOne unit would be reachable and the other not but then the inverse happens after a few seconds.  I made sure the local switch isn't throwing any random messages and connecting a laptop directly showed no drops.  Digging one more time into the printer configs I spotted the issue, as improbable as it was.\n\nAll printers had the same MAC address.  \n\nI stared at my screen, all printers side by side, same MAC address.  There was no way of changing them from either the access panel nor the web console.  Then came the fun of  explaining the issue to the onsite tech, their tech team, AND the manufacturer support.   Yes, they have the correct IP info, yes I can print and ping them, yes I STILL have a problem!  \n\nWe then look to the packaging the NIC cards came so I can relay the from-manufacturer information that should contain the assigned MAC address for the cards.  What was shown started to put the puzzle together.\n\nTESTWIREDMAC\n\nIt seems that, at factory, these cards were set to put a test MAC on the units and not the real ones they were to be assigned.   This was the case for all printer we received!  So that we could  quickly resolve this issue, the install tech contacted their distribution team to send us new card BUT to confirm the MACs first.  Every single card they had of the same model had the same MAC.\n\nThe installation team apologized for the mishap and sent a company-wide email stating these particular card were faulty.  Luckily these printers were not ready for production but they could be trained on while they fight with the manufacturer.\n\nI've seen some odd thing in may career but this is the first hard breaking bug I have encountered and repeatable at the manufacturing level!  Now if you excuse me, I need to double the creamer in my coffee..",

        "text": "I messed something up today guys and I still feel awful about it.  I'm going to have PTSD nightmares about dongles and cables because of this for a long time I think.  \n\nI'm a tier 2 helpdesk guy at company that has about 300 or so users.  Our HR department is running meetings this week at every office for open enrollment of health insurance.  Our corporate office doesn't have a space for that many people, so we run them offsite.\n\nThe first meeting on Monday was perfectly smooth.  It's just a portable screen, a projector, a VGA cable running to a VGA-micro display dongle into the director of HR's surface.  Went off without a hitch; everything was great.\n\nThis gave me a false sense of confidence going into today, which was the second meeting at our main corporate office.\n\nThe director of HR was running the same meeting at a different office.  No big deal, we'll just use my laptop.  This projector has a VGA port, plus two DVI ports.  So I just brought two DVI cables and a DVI-HDMI adapter as my laptop only has HDMI.\n\nThe other thing about this meeting was that we were going to record it using GoToMeeting to distribute it to the company.  Not like a webcam, but just the powerpoint on screen and the audio.\n\nSo I get there slightly later than I want because of construction on the exit, so I'm already kind of in a hurry.  I walk in, start setting up, and have a realization: I need internet to run GoToMeeting.  I don't know why it didn't occur to me before, but no big deal.  I'll just go get the password.  I find the dude that manages this venue and he says they do not offer wifi.  \"What about this network here that's the same name as your venu?\"  Yeah, that's an internal network.  We don't allow anyone to use it.\n\nFuck.\n\nSo I go to break the news to HR that this is not going to be recorded using GoToMeeting.  They seem ok with it.  We can just record audio and then add it over the powerpoint later.\n\nAt this point, people are starting to arrive, so I have to get the laptop/projector setup pretty quick.  So I boot the laptop up, get the powerpoint off the USB, open it.  While I'm doing that, I plug the DVI into the HDMI adapter and then into the projector.  Turn the projector on, only see a blue screen.  Huh, that's weird.  Duh, the projector has a \"source\" button, I need to change from VGA to DVI.  I do that, still blue screen.  Ok, maybe I just need to set it up in display properties.  Right click in the desktop go to display properties, \"no other devices detected.\"\n\n*Fuck*\n\nOk, don't panic, maybe it's the cable.  I swap it for the other DVI cable.  Same thing.  So this projector is not accepting a DVI input.  Don't know why, but that's the situation I'm in.\n\nThink, think, think.  I know it works with VGA.  It did a couple of days ago.  But I don't have a VGA-HDMI adapter.  Well, I brought a backup laptop.  I grab that, it's the same fucking model as my laptop.  Only HDMI.\n\nAt this point, the whole meeting (at least 50 people) are all seated and staring at me.  The host has been trying to stall for several minutes as I hail-mary attempt to unplug and replug everything in, reboot the projector and my laptop, etc.  Still nothing.\n\nIt's only now that the reality of this washes over me.  This meeting isn't going to have a recording or a projector.  Basically my only two functions for coming here.\n\nI pulled the host HR person aside and explained what was happening to her.  She said it was fine and that she could it without the powerpoint, but I was still mortified.\n\nSo that's how my day went.  Have you guys ever failed completely at your job while 50+ people stared at you?  It sucks.",

Today was a little different.\n\nWe have a mobile MRI trailer parked outside of our facility. It has a power and Network jack set up specifically for it on the outside of the building. They pull up, plug in, and start scanning folks- that's how it is supposed to work. The setup is, what most would assume, foolproof. We just hadn't planned on someone like $user.\n\nToday I get this-\n\n&gt;$rad- The MRI Trailer has no network connection, can you please come take a look?\n\n&gt;$me- On my way.\n\nI take a laptop and a fluke cable tester and go out there. I do a quick look around at everything I can see and am allowed to fix (MRI trailer belongs to them so technically I can't work on it or it's little intranet). I test cables, verify hot switch ports, etc. In the end, I plug my laptop into the cable they use to connect and show them that there IS INDEED network connection coming all the way out to their trailer, but something in their intranet is messed up- a switch, router, shorted cable, etc- that is causing the issue.\n\n&gt;$user- Can't you just fix it?\n\n&gt;$me- Unfortunately, the trailer belongs to your company and I'm not authorized to  attempt any repairs on anything that doesn't explicitly belong to our hospital.\n\n&gt;$user- Just do your job and fix it!\n\nEtc, so on and so forth. I have to, over the course of the next hour, speak to $rad, $user, $user's supervisor, and a host of own admin team, and personally show them all how the network works just fine up until they try to connect their trailer to it. \n\nMeanwhile, $user is being increasingly angry and ugly about the situation. Calling $me lazy, saying I'm trying to shift the blame for the problem so it wouldn't be my responsibility, etc. Trying her best to throw me under the bus.\n\nFinally, I hear from one of their companies' technicians- They had just installed a new switch in that trailer, and could I please verify that it was plugged in and working for them.\n\nGuess what wasn't plugged in? The little switch. It was mounted in a pretty well hidden area up under a desk/cabinet thing. The power cable, however, was routed out onto the desk, and plugged into the wall in plain view. \n\n$User had just UNPLUGGED it from the power outlet it was plugged into, and INSTEAD had plugged in her cell phone charger.\n\nI plugged it in. Their network sprang to life.\n\nI went ahead and filled out my helpdesk ticket with all of the pertinent information and our department sent their company an invoice for our time spent- about half of the day, or over $1000- because $user decided she needed candy crush worse than patients needed accurate MRI readings.\n\n**TL,DR- User unplugs stuff, plays candy crush. I get lots of internet points telling you all about it.**\n\nEdit- Spelling, formatting, etc.\n\nEdit the second- Top of TFTS? Oh lort.\n\nEdit Part III- Jebus. Second page of /r/all. Someone I know will probably see this.",

She is an exec assistant and is logged into her boss's computer. Perfect, All I need to do is remote in, copy the path and map the drive.\n\n\nWhen I remoted in, the path seemed very long with several subfolders. Confirmed path with user again and she confirmed it was what was emailed to her. She mentions this is her boss' computer and will be back shortly expecting the drive to be there. I see there are another 9 shared folders mapped. So I need to use a random letter as the one she requested was already taken.\n\n\nI map the drive and successfully am able to open it. There is only one excel on this folder and she says she needs access to subfolders above this one. OK... so I get her to state for the call that it was not the complete path she gave me to map but only up to the very first folder after the server name.\n\n\nThis is where the fun started. Went back to computer, where the network drives are displayed, right click on the one I just mapped and selected 'disconnect' So I can re-map the shorter path. Nothing happened when I clicked it so I right click, disconnect again. \n\n\n&gt;She yelped \"Why would you do that?\"\n\n&gt;Me: Oh, so we can re-map the correct folder\n\n&gt;her: Oh, I mean, you deleted the wrong folder\n\n&gt;Me: *thinking oh crap... great moment for a bit of lag on the remote session* (I know. I should have been a bit more patient waiting for the drive disconnect.)\n\n\nI check the screen and there was an extra drive missing. \noh shit, oh shit... I ask her if she has the path somewhere in a previous email, previous ticket or anything since I barely even glanced at it and have no idea what it said.\n\n\nShe said no, of course, as I scrambled to find previous request tickets trying to find the one where they originally requested access for it. 5 minutes have passed since the accidental removal of the drive and this is an eternity for helpdesk with nothing being done.\n\n\nI place her on hold with an idea in mind. I run to our favorite people, QA and ask them how long does it take for a call recording to be available eon their system for grading. The answer surprised me: \"Oh we can look at it now. Are they on hold?\" \nSweet! we can even rewind my current call!\n\n\nWe get to the part before I deleted it. Glad it was set up with a view set so you can see the server and full folder path. YESS\n\n\nScreenshot, sent to my computer, get back on with the user, remap accidentally deleted drive, map drive she originally requested and she is good to go! \n\n\nTLDR; We normally dislike QA for being picky about specifics but they came to the rescue when I needed help ASAP.+",

        "text": "Some of you might have noticed that earlier in the year, one particular orange-clad AV company purchased another, whose icon heavily resembled Microsoft's. The purchased company has an inventory management/monitoring platform that we make heavy use of, along with its integrated antivirus. So we saw the announcement, and figured it was a case of \"meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\" After all, this had happened once before - it went from $SteadySurface to $NotWindows soon after we had bought it. So the $Ahoy acquisition was just going to be an orange coat of paint on the old stuff, right?  \nRight. I don't know what I was thinking either.  \n\nThe problems started mid-November, when the new antivirus decided to pull a Windows 10. You get the new software version! YOU get the new software version! You *all* get the new software! All of a sudden we were fielding multiple calls from clients freaking out about the popups they were getting. Justifiably, because it was flagging things that $NotWindows never did, including scripts and such that the management software itself was pushing out.  \nI was not directly involved, but the week of Thanksgiving, two different clients suddenly had issues getting their VMs to start. The host was fussing that the hypervisor wasn't running. Bull, as it was set to start in bcdedit and in BIOS, but no dice. One was an older machine that needed to be migrated anyway, the other was a seldom-used TS, so the issue wasn't completely widespread. But the client with the TS was also having issues with its on-site SMTP relay - one server would connect to the email servers just fine, the other would not no matter what settings we used. It was a holiday weekend and none of it was mission-critical, so we figured we'd take a look at it this week.  \nCut to Monday's email.  \n&gt;Alert: $OldCrappyLegacyButMissionCriticalVM not responding.  \n\nI'd inherited this client and this particular part wasn't well documented, so I trod carefully. Hypervisor not running, even though everything else clearly stated it was. Google-fu was failing me, and the techs that weren't out and about couldn't make heads or tails of it either.  \nI'd gotten the alert overnight, and was still staring stumped at lunch. $Burrito volunteered for the Rubber Duck position.  \n&gt;**$Burrito:** Quack.  \n**$Extension:** Hokay, so....*I love queso* what do these servers all have in common?  \n**$Burrito:** Server 2008 R2?  \n**$Extension:** Besides that.  \n**$Burrito:** Wandows updates?  \n**$Extension:** *One remote matryoshka session later* Nope. That one hasn't even installed updates in a while....*makes note to fix and point fingers*  \n**$Burrito:** What changed in the past couple weeks?  \n**$Extension:** ....Fcking $Ahoy.  \n\nI pulled up the console and started poking around at the settings, figuring I just needed to turn the whole thing off and test. Till I pulled up, ironically enough, the Troubleshooting page.  \nRight smack dab in the middle of that part of the console is a checkbox to enable hardware virtualization, with a child setting to allow nested virtualization. It specifically names VMware and Virtualbox as needing that setting to function.  \n&gt;**$Extension:** *many swears* That's the culprit. That jerk.  \n**$Burrito:** Wait, does it even work?  \n**$Extension:** We're doing it live.  \n\nI check the box to allow nested virtualization and reboot. And wait. And wait.  \n&gt;**$Extension:** ....Oops.  \n**$Burrito:** You dun goofed.  \n\nOne drive of shame later I was staring at a BSoD I'd never actually seen before. \"Hardware malfunction, call your vendor for support.\" Having done a similar dance with Windows 7/$NotWindows NimbusCare/Trusteer in the past month, Safe Mode and nuking the AV entirely was enough to get it running again. And the $OCLBMCVM started again like nothing had ever happened.  \nI reaped my just reward once I got back to the office.  \n\n&gt;**$Steve:** Why the ever-loving Fibonacci would you reboot a production server during business hours?  \n**$Extension:** *You're welcome.*  \n**$Extension:** *~What can I say, except You're Welcome!*  \n**$Burrito:** *death glare* I am never gonna get that out of my head.  \n**$Extension:** Thaaaaanks, love ya.  \n\nAnd silence, blessed silence, reigned.....for a couple minutes.  \n&gt;**$BlazeIT, via IM:** Oi, can I get your help with something?  \n**$Extension, via IM:** Oh yeah, $Ahoy caused the VM issue.  \n**$BlazeIT, via IM:** ...this is my shocked face.  \n**$Extension, via IM:** Yep. Anyway, what were you needing?  \n**$BlazeIT, via IM:** That SMTP issue is on both servers now.  \n**$Extension, via IM:** .....wait. No. Couldn't be.  \n\nYep. Howdy, Anti-Spam component! Glad to see you're on by default too.  \nWe did a courtesy flush of the queue after disabling the component, since there were a fair few pending messages. Most of them from Postmaster.  \n&gt;**$BlazeIT, via IM:** RIP my inbox from all those test messages I sent  \n**$Extension, via IM:** Good jorb. It's working on both.  \n**$BlazeIT, via IM:** So how many servers is this affecting?  \n**$Extension, via IM:** Good question.  \n**$Cable:** Hold on, lemme automate that.  \n\n$Cable modified the default server policy, we all learned a valuable lesson in software management, and I only broke down crying twice. It was a good day......   \n....until we came back the next morning and the settings had turned themselves back on.  \n\nEpilogue: I let the other tech at the first client know about the fix for the hypervisor, and the cause. His response was copy-pasted Sarcastically Surprised Kirk and the caption \"Quelle Surprise.\"",

        "text": "*This tale started out very differently, planning to be the story of my somewhat-disaster licensing test, but once I started writing it out became a very, very different animal—a story that should be written first, before I write that.*\n\n***\n\nAs my time with the Army drew to a close, I had to be moved from my unit in Egypt back to the U.S. for outprocessing.  Given the choice between Fort Riley, Kansas or Fort Campbell, Kentucky, I decided to take the route with less suffering and try my luck spending the last three months of Army service with the 101st in Kentucky.  I attempted to warn the Replacement Depot that they should just keep me on-staff for the next three months as any actual unit would be pissed to receive me, but no dice; I found myself with orders to join the very Engine Shop that replaced me back when I left Afghanistan just over a year before.  \n\nThe First Sergeant wasn’t exactly happy to see me---in fact, he would later tell me to get out of his sight and he never wanted to see me again—since I was taking up a valuable NCO slot he could have used to promote one of his people into, but the Engine Shop itself was happy to have me join them.  We swapped stories of our overseas time since we’d last seen one another for a while, and then the squad leader chimed in.\n\n&gt;**$101stSquadLeader** “Hey, ZeeWulf, did you know we fixed the B-Sump issue?”\n\nThe banter stopped and at that point I was all ears….\n\n***\n*Afghanistan, 20 months earlier*\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “What do you mean, its leaking again?!  That’s a brand new engine!”\n\n&gt;**PCOfficer**  “Yes, and it’s pissing oil out the tailpipe.  Just like the last one.”\n\nI looked over at SquadLeader, [Bane](https://redd.it/72k6gr) [of My](https://redd.it/71kt0w) [Existence,](https://redd.it/74hhm6)  for some sort of advice or at least support.  It was, of course, not going to come.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “We can’t just keep replacing these check valves, there’s some other issue we need to troubleshoot to figure out why they keep failing.”\n\n&gt;**SquadLeader** “You aren’t going to do any troubleshooting.  You’re going to replace it. And every other one that fails.  You are not here to troubleshoot, you’re here to fix helicopters.”\n\nWith a sigh I when and loaded the toolbox onto the gator and signaled for my Keeper, OldManPrivate to join me.  He gathered up the chain for his rifle, secured it around his body and locked it, and then we drove out to the leaking aircraft together.  His chain rattled as we drove, a constant reminder to him of the myriad of reasons not to forget your rifle in the chow hall and to me of the fickle nature of our leadership.\n\nEver since we started installing the new, higher-powered D-model engine, we’d been having issues with one of the B-Sump check valves purging oil constantly.  It would be fine for the first ten hours or so of operation, but as time wore on it would start leaking oil out the drain in the engine’s tailpipe.  This particular check valve was for the ‘B-Sump.’  The B-Sump was the second main support bearing housing that supported the compressor power shaft, of which there were three bearings and housings total.  The sump was called such because it holds a certain amount of oil that, in the case of an oil system failure, it can provide a small amount of emergency lubrication to those main bearings. \n\nThe B-Sump itself was housed deep in the center of the engine, surrounded by the combustor can.  It is an extremely hot area and I knew that, with the D-model engine being capable of running hotter than the C-Model we were switching from, the issue had to be something to do with the increased power.  I just hadn’t nailed down what, yet.\n\nArriving at the aircraft on the flightline, I clambered up to the engine with my wrenches and the sump check valve.  It’s not a big part, no larger really than an AA battery, and located on top of the engine so it was easy to swap.  It was more time-consuming the clean up the oil mess, which the crew chief had determined was our responsibility since it was our engine that made his helicopter dirty.  \n\nThis problem would continue to plague us until we redeployed back to the U.S. and since I had moved heaven and earth while I was still in Afghanistan to transfer elsewhere, I zipped out of that company without ever getting an answer to it.\n\n***\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “What?  No, tell me, what did you guys find?”\n\n&gt;**$101stSquadLeader** “Well….”\n\n***\n\n…It seems that I had been right—to a point.  The engine shop from the 101st was much more willing to put their neck out there and think outside the box than my own shop was permitted.  This leak problem had been escalated to the manufacturer and their engineers were banging their heads on the wall trying to find a solution—The Army wasn’t exactly pleased with the maintenance issues this ‘better’ engine was causing.  And then one day, $101stSquadLeader had been thinking on the issue and happened across a realization.\n\nThe new D-Model engine utilized the same exact gear box and cold (compressor) modules as the C-model, whereas the hot (combustor) and turbine sections had been reworked for the higher temperatures and higher horsepower output.  The horsepower comes from the power shaft speeds, which were much, much higher than the C-model engine.  The B-Sump itself, as is the majority of the oil system, was part of the cold section module—which had never been reworked to deal with the increased rotational speeds it was now being pushed to.  This meant the oil pump, driven by the gearbox, in turn driven by the compressor shaft, was putting out a greatly increased oil pressure.\n\nIn this moment of epiphany, $101stSquadLeader had $PolishMercenary (She was a Polish citizen and said she joined our Army because the pay was better...) and another guy crack open one of the new engines and yank the [A-Sump]( https://redd.it/75gssy), located in the forward section of the engine.  Breaking down the sump itself, he located the oil spray nozzles for the bearings and then proceeded to drill them out wider, ever so slightly.  They reassembled it and convinced their $PCOfficer to slap it on a helicopter.  \n\nWhen it didn’t explode and everything suddenly seemed to work again, they told the Manufacturer Rep their solution, who in turn had them meet some engineers.  Upon discovering just what this engine shop had done, the engineers gave birth to many, many kittens and were in an uproar, claiming what they’d done was flagrantly unsafe and an impossible way to fix it.  \n***\n\n$101stSquadLeader looked at me, a glint of humor in his eye.\n\n&gt;**$101stSquadLeader** “And the best part?  A few months ago the repair procedure came out.  Telling us to do exactly what we did.”\n\n***TL/DR:*** *Engine designers gave engine more power, didn't redesign it to handle more power.  Mechanic engineers solution, engineers upset at being outsmarted by mechanic.*\n",

        "text": "I bought this card online called a MoviePass. Basically it's 10 bucks a month and you can go see any movie once per day. I'm a huge moviegoer and so is my family so i suggested it to my parents they get one.   \nSo here's the process of how it works. You sign in on the app, select your theater, movie, and time. Then you have to click \"check in\" within 100 yards of the theater which reserves you a ticket. Finally you get to the kiosk and select that same movie and time as you did on the app, and use your card they sent you to pay and it prints your ticket.\n\n\nOne day my parents get home from the theater and are all grumpy and complaining about how it didn't work and it's an awful service they're refunding the card. I think nothing of it until one day comes where we all go out to see a movie. I use the app, print my ticket and am good to go. They start trying and are having all kinds of issues. I struggle to find out why until I check who's logged in. They were both logged into my dads account on both of their phones. This lead to me following the process that happened the night they went alone.\n\n \nMy mom reserves a ticket for a movie on her phone with my dad's account thinking it's her account. Then my dad tries to reserve a ticket on his phone and it gives him an error that he already has a reservation. Confused, he keeps on trying but obviously it won't work because he technically does already have a reservation. So my mom comes up with the idea that well, at least we will get one ticket out of this since it let her reserve hers. So she goes through the kiosk, selects the same movie and time as on the app and goes to pay. Card declined. Could be just an error so she swipes again, and again, and again. But she is trying to pay with a card with her name on it that has no reservation connected to it. Now they're both frustrated and end up actually paying for the tickets themselves.   \nBack to the present day, I sign my mom out of my dads account and into her own on her phone so that they both are on their own accounts. They both get their individual tickets. It works. They ask me to explain and I take about 15 minutes trying but they still don't get it. Basically telling me that I have to go with them every time they go to see a movie because I'm a wizard and it's too complicated to understand. ",

        "text": "Background: about a decade in IT support - networks, hardware, software. I have worked for different companies that provide IT support to other companies.\n\nDisclosure: English is not my first language, so there probably are  mistakes. If the mistakes bother you, please point them out, I will try to correct them.\n\nActors in this story:\n\n**$TheClient** - the Company I provided the support to  \n**$ISP** - The Internet Service Provider  \n**$ISPSupportPersonLevel1** - The ISP's Level 1 technical support  \n**$ISPSupportPersonLevel2** - The ISP's advanced technical support  \n**$me** -  Yours truly  \n\n$TheClient had an in-house database, that was also used by other companies (my client was a member of a bigger group), but at the beginning all the database clients were on the same LAN (different subnets). \n\nOne day $TheClient decided to move the database to a server farm, the connection to the database was done over a dedicated optical fiber line, so the server stayed on the same subnet. Basically the $ISP slapped FO media converters on both ends of the fiber and we then connected the Ethernet port to our switch. No configuration was required on our side.\n\nAbout the same time the client had decided to move to a new office. New office was built for them and they moved one year later. I supervised the move (or rather carried the servers and the network equipment from the old location to the new office and installed them). One of the issues was the database server - the client needed another fiber line to the server farm. \n\nThe server farm was hosted by the ISP who also provided the internet connection to my client. They also managed to sell my client a VoIP solution, which would use the same fiber line the database connection was on. Now the fun part begins.\n\nTo assure the quality of the VoIP calls, the ISP installed QoS routers on the fiber line so they could prioritize the VoIP traffic. But that meant we had to start routing traffic. On our end I had to route the database traffic to the QoS router, which was then supposed to push it over the FO line to the other router, which then routed the traffic to the database server, and then back again. My job was to create routings on the clients firewall and the database server. \n\nI finished my routings and then pinged the database server:\n\n&gt;ping -t [ip of the database server]  \n&gt;Reply from [The client side QoS router]: TTL expired in transit.  \n&gt;Reply from [The client side QoS router]: TTL expired in transit.  \n\nA routing loop? Ok, lets trace the route.\n\n&gt;tracert [ip of the database server]  \n&gt;1     2 ms     1 ms     4 ms  [the clients firewall/router]  \n&gt;2     1 ms     1 ms     2 ms  [The client side QoS router]  \n&gt;3     3 ms     5 ms     5 ms  [The ISP side QoS router]  \n&gt;4     1 ms     1 ms     2 ms  [The client side QoS router]  \n&gt;5     3 ms     5 ms     5 ms  [The ISP side QoS router]  \n&gt;6     1 ms     1 ms     2 ms  [The client side QoS router]  \n&gt;7     3 ms     5 ms     5 ms  [The ISP side QoS router]  \n…\n\n(The numbers are illustrative, I don't have the actual trace logs)\n\nSo the QoS routers are playing Ping-Pong with my pings until the packets TTL expires.\n\nI call the isp:\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel1 - Hello, this is $ISP, how may i help\n\n&gt;$me - Hi this is Visavillem, I'm calling on behalf the $Client. The QoS router on your side is not configured properly.\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel1 - What do you mean? \n\n&gt;$me - The traffic to the database server is routed back to the QoS router on the clients site.\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLeve1 - Have you tried to restart your router equipment? \n\nHere we go… I'm not going to go through the home user troubleshooting script, when the problem is clearly on their side. Plus, I actually had restarted my router and the client side QoS router. The one with the routing problem i had no access to, so no way of rebooting that.\n\n&gt;$me - Listen, this is a custom connection created specially for the $client. How about we wont waste each others time and you escalate this to the next level?\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel1 - This is a custom connection?\n\n&gt;$me - Yes, as i said, a custom connection created for the $client\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel1 - Please hold…\n\n&gt;…On-hold music for 15 minutes…\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel1 - Hello, are you still there?\n\n&gt;$me - Yes (internal $me - Yes, still waching the paint dry and grass grow)\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel1 - I will forward your call to the Advanced Technical support, please hold\n\n&gt;…more on-hold music … It's Mozart, I don't remember the name of the piece …\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Hi, this is $ISP advanced technical support, how can we help?\n\n&gt;$me - Your QoS routers on the fiber line are playing Ping-Pong with the packets.\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 -  A fiber line?\n\n&gt;$me - Did't the level 1 person give you the information about the issue?\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Actually no..\n\n&gt;internal $me - You must be fsck-ing kidding me\n\nSo I proceed to describe the setup and the issue\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Okay… I'm not familiar with your system, can you please hold, I'll ask if anyone knows something about that?\n\n&gt;$me - My phones battery is dying, maybe you can call me back once you have a solution? (It was a lie, but I had enough Mozart for the day)\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Okay, which number I should call?\n\n&gt;$me - Can't you see the number I'm calling from?\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Oh, you want me to call this number?\n\n&gt;internal $me - no, I want you to call the President…\n\n&gt;$me - Yes, that would be good.\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Okay, I will call you back.\n\nAfter about an hour he calls back\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Hi this is $ISP Advanced Technical Support, you called us with an issue with your Internet connection?\n\n&gt;$me - It's not the internet connection, it's the custom VoIP and database connection to your server farm.\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Oh, sorry… Yes, a custom connection… please hold…\n\n&gt;…On-hold music for 5 minutes.\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Hello, are you still there?\n\n&gt;$me (starting to feel frustrated) - Yes, still holding.\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Good. I spoke with a network admin, he promised he'll look into it in about an hour, is that OK\n\n&gt;internal $me - No, it's not OK, im sick and tired of this thing, I want it solved NOW, so i can go home.\n\n&gt;$me - Do i have a choice?\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Haha, not really…\n\n&gt;$me - Ok. Let me know when it's done.\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Sure, bye.\n\nAnd so i have to wait another hour. I monitored the connection and noticed when the routing got fixed and the database became available. \n\nThe support person calls me back:\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Hi. The admin told me everything should work now, can you confirm?\n\n&gt;$me - yes, everything works normally, thank you. But can you please make a note in the clients file, that hey have this custom connection, so that I won't have to explain it again to the next person? And also, please back up the configuration  on the QoS routers, so that we can solve problems faster?\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Sure thing, we will do that.\n\n&gt;$me - Thanks Bye\n\nFast forward 6 months. I get a notification from the ISP, that they plan to upgrade the QoS routers. So I dig out the documentation and start monitoring the database connection. And sure enough, it goes down (that was expected, I notified all the clients, that the database will be unavailable). The connection was supposed to go down for 30 minutes.\nAfter 35 minutes passed, the client called that the database is still unavailable. I started to troubleshoot. \n\nThe ping once again said that the TTL was expired, and the QoS routers were playing Ping-pong with the packets.\n\nI once again call the ISP and ask for the advanced support. \n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Our monitoring shows everything is OK. The problem has to be on your side.\n\n&gt;$me - In the last 6 months there have been no changes on our side. But you upgraded the routers, and now the connection does not work. How can the problem be on our side? Also we had the same problem in the beginning, and it turned out the routers were misconfigured.\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Can you please hold for a moment?\n\n&gt;internal $me - No I cant hold. The client is demanding answers, the connection to the database was supposed to be down for only 30 minutes, 45 minutes have passed and the connection is still down.\n\n&gt;$me - No, I cant hold, but can you call me back when you have the solution?\n\n&gt;$ISPSupportPersonLevel2 - Sure.\n\nI had no intention to wait. One of my coworkers knew a network admin at the ISP company, so I asked if he could maybe contact his friend. It took 15 minutes and the problem was solved (the issue was once again with the configuration of the QoS router at the ISP side), and I owed a case of beer to my coworker and his friend.\n\nAfter that my client told the ISP that they are in no circumstances to touch the routers, unless they provide a direct number of a network admin.\n\nTL;DR - Routers want to have fun too, their favorite game is ping Ping-Pong. Also, it's important to have friends in high places.\n\nEdit: Capitalization and typos. Thanks /u/AbsentMindedApricot.  \nEdit2: I have to hire a proofreader...  \nEdit3: Some punctuation errors.

A few bumps, but overall this months-long progress went better than expected. \n\nOne downside of the cutover migration is that all users have to recreate their Outlook profiles so they point at Office 365 instead of the old mail server. But I planned for that! Put together a PowerShell script that deletes the Outlook profile and has a flag to run just once. Deployed through Group Policy to run Monday morning after the cutover. Worked like a charm, but I still put together step-by-step instructions if the GPO didn’t apply for some reason.\n\nI planned this for weeks, sent out reminders, instructions, strategically placed printed instructions throughout the building before go-live. I was prepared! And shockingly, very few users asked for help. \n\nToday, $user returned from vacation last and was waiting for me at the front door. \n\n$user (standing 1 foot away from the printed instructions): Can you help me with the email thing?\n\n$me (strongly considering just pointing to the instructions): Did you go through the instructions?\n\n$user: ...\n\n$me: ...\n\n$user: ... But I’m so tired today \n\nMoral of the story: no amount of preparation will prevent lazy users. ",

I work at an MSP and I recently did a full upgrade to this clients system so i knew exactly what was installed and what was not. All domain accounts needed local admin due to janky obscure software.\n\nIt starts like many of these tales, with a call from a user.\n\n\n\nU = User, Me = Me\n\n\n\n&gt; U: I have a problem with *easily fixed software*. Can you please help?\n\n\n&gt; Me: Sure. I will just need to remote into your computer to sort it out. Please run the remote tool on the desktop and read me out the numbers it gives you in the box that pops up. \n\n\nNow, she said she could not find it but I KNOW it is there because I saw it there only the day before.\n\n\n&gt; Me: Ok, that is fine we can download it again.

        "text": "Edit:  This story takes place at a small telecom that specializes in bulk housing (mainly dorms and multi-family homes) in the US.  \n\n---\n\nThe ticket said that the EU had been unable to maintain a connection to the Internet.  It should have been an open-and-shut case.  There was just one problem....\n\n&gt; **Walt:** Sir, from the sound of things...  sir, please listen...if you think the problem is with your computer, then you will....  sir...\n\n\nCast  \n* Me: Tier 2 Network Analyst and defacto supervisor.  \n* Walt: One of our three newbies.  \n* Amelia:  Supervisor in name only \n* Borat: Our caller with super-thick accent and poor listening comprehension skills.  \n\nI don't wanna be a supervisor.  Been there, done that.  Sucked at it. But we've hired three newbies in the past month and someone had to help them find their feet.  Since Amelia has (by her own admission) never been too good with with handling day to day operations, this responsibility fell to me.  \n\nSo when I heard Walt in the next cube over struggling mightily with someone who apparently didn't want to listen I intervened.\n\n&gt; **Me** *(to Walt in chat)***:** You want me to take over?  \n&gt; **Walt:** Please.  \n&gt; **Me:** Pass him over.  \n&gt; **Walt:** Sir, let me transfer you over to one of my colleagues.  She's a bit more experienced than I am and may be able to better assist you.\n\nFive seconds later, my phone rings.\n\n&gt; **Me:** Thank you for calling Baby Bell, my name is simAlity, how may I help you?  \n&gt; **Borat:** You new tech?  You help me?  \n&gt; **Me:** Ah, Mr. Borat.  Yes, I'm Walt's colleague.  I understand you are having trouble staying connected to the Internet.  \n&gt; **Borat:** Yes, very weird issue.  Computer worked fine at old apartment.  Does not work here.  The adapter keeps crashing.  \n\nI'm going to ignore that bit about the adapter crashing for now.  At best it is his way of saying that the adapter isn't doing his job.  At worst it indicates a device issue.  I'm a network tech.  Adapter issues are officially out of my scope.\n\n&gt; **Me:** Have you ever run the ipconfig /release and /renew commands?  \n&gt; **Borat:** is that spelled *(very clearly)* I-P-C-O-N-F-I-G?  \n&gt; **Me:** Yes, exactly and then you add slash release and --  \n&gt; **Borat:** No, never run it.    \n&gt; **Me:** Okay, let's do this.  \n&gt; **Borat:**  You want me to reboot?  \n&gt; **Me:** No...let's run the commands first.  \n&gt; **Borat:** You want me to reboot first?  \n&gt; **Me:** Err...you can if you want.  \n&gt; **Borat:** Okay I reboot.  [pause] Ooops, I accidentally turned it off instead.  \n&gt; **Me:** No worries!  I can wait.  \n\nAnd wait I did.  Borat took this time to talk about what a *strange* issue this was.  And how sometimes things that were supposed to help actually hurt.  And how his PC worked fine at the old complex.  And how...*blah, blah, blah*\n\nFinally...\n\n&gt; **Borat:** Computer is back on.  Internet still doesn't work.  Very weird issue.  \n&gt; **Me:** Wait, so you can't get online at all?  \n&gt; **Borat:** No.  Not at all.  I try many things to fix the issue but problem only get worse.  \n&gt; **Me:** It is beginning to sound like the problem is with the PC itself.  \n&gt; **Borat:** No.  Worked fine at last apartment complex.  \n\n*sigh*  It's going to be one of those calls.\n\n&gt; **Me:** Excellent.  Go ahead and open the command prompt.  \n&gt; **Borat:** It's open.  \n&gt; **Me:** Now type in, IPCONFIG  \n&gt; **Borat:** Is that spelled I-P-C-O-N-F-I-T?  \n&gt; **Me:** I-*G*.  \n&gt; **Borat:** I-*G*  \n&gt; **Me:** Right.  Now hit the space bar and the slash and now type in R-E-L-E-A-S-E and then hit \"enter\"  \n&gt; **Borat:** It says \"Not recognized as an internal or external command or batch file.  \n&gt; **Me:** Hmm...can you read back what you typed in letter by letter?  \n&gt; **Borat:** I-T-C-O-N-F-I-T-I-G- -/-R-E-L-E-A-S-E  \n&gt; **Me:** No...it I as in Igloo, P as in Paul, C as in Charlie, O as in Orange, N as in Nancy, F as in Frank, I as in Igloo, G as in Gary then you hit space then you hit slash...  \n&gt; **Borat:** Which slash?  \n&gt; **Me:** The one next to your shift key.  Now type R-E-L-E-A-S-E  \n&gt; **Borat:** So I type, I as in igloo, T as in Tall....  \n\nI begin beating my head on the desk.  He had spelled it perfectly at the beginning of the call.  Had he forgotten that already?\n\n&gt; **Me:** Tell you what.  How about I email the commands to you.  \n&gt; **Borat:** Oh yes, yes, I wait for your email  \n&gt; **Me:** Okay one second.  \n&gt; **Borat:** Still waiting for email.  \n&gt; **Me:** Yeah, it's going to take a sec for me to get it typed out.  \n&gt; **Borat** *(sing-song)***:** waiting...just waiting... *(more sing-song mumbles)*  \n&gt; **Me:** Okay, email sent.  \n&gt; **Borat:** How do I check email when computer can't get online?  \n&gt; **Me:** With your phone?  \n&gt; **Borat** *(sounding very* Borat*-y)***:** Oh, okay!  *(pause)* My phone won't go online.  This is very weird problem.  Gimme minute.  Trying something.    \n\nTen minutes later (yes, I counted)\n\n&gt; **Me:** How about I give you a call back in a bit.  \n&gt; **Borat:** Yes, yes.  Say...five minutes?  \n&gt; **Me:** Okay, five minutes.  \n\nThe first thing I did was send Borat an email saying, \"Call me when you get this.\"  That seemed safer than calling back in five minutes when his phone's \"internet issues\" may or may not be resolved.  Then I spent the next 10 minutes clearing tickets and bringing Walt up to speed.  \n\n&gt; **Tier 1:** I've got a caller who is looking for you.  Name is Borat?  \n&gt; **Me:** Okay, send him on through.  \n\n&gt;**Borat:** I got your email!  \n&gt; **Me:** Excellent.  Did you run the commands?  \n&gt; **Borat:** Yes.  Restricted network still does not work.\n\nThe BabyBell offers its apartment complexes two networks.  One is secure, the other is not.  The secure network requires a username and password and basic encryption between the computer and the access point.  The other does not.  That's really about the only difference between them.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** What about the open network?  \n&gt; **Borat:** it works.  \n&gt; **Me:** Well that's an improvement.  \n&gt; **Borat:** Encrypted network doesn't work though. Very weird issue  Last agent fixed.  What you do to fix?  \n\nThe last agent had actually thrown his hands up and transferred the call to me.  Had he forgotten that as well?  (I swear I'm not making this stuff up).\n\n&gt; **Me:** We can change your password and that might fix the secure network as well.  \n&gt; **Borat** Computer work fine at old apartment complex.  Not work here.  Very weird issue.  So...so...weird.  I try many things to fix.  Found code on youtube.  I send it to you.  You read code, yes?  I send you code now.  \n&gt; **Me:** No, please, I don't want to see the code.  I'm not comfortable with that idea at all.  From everything you said, it sounds like there is a problem with the computer itself and you will need to take it to the Geek Squad or someone like that.  \n&gt; **Borat:** You are network specialist.  Your network doesn't work on my computer.  Old apartment network work on computer.  You fix my computer!  \n\nOkay this is getting crazy.  Time to pull Amelia off facebook and get her to be a supervisor in more than name only.\n\n&gt; **Me** *(to Amelia)***:** I'm about to lose my temper with this guy.  Are you available for a transfer?  \n&gt; **Amelia:** This the same guy you and Walt were talking about earlier?  \n&gt; **Me:** Yeah.  \n&gt; **Amelia:** What's his problem?  \n&gt; **Me:** Pretty sure he wants us to fix his computer.  \n&gt; **Amelia:** I'm listening in on the call.  \n\nMeanwhile Borat's email had made its way through our system and attached itself to his ticket.  The \"code\" turned out to be several commands that may or may not have reset his TCP adapter...or something.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Sir, I've received your email.  I can't say I understand what this code was supposed to accomplish.  I'm a network tech.  I don't make repairs to computers.  The most I can do is walk you through resetting your IP address.  That's it.  If you want me to help you reset your network password, I'll be happy to, but that's all I can do.  \n&gt; **Borat** I'll change password but only if you promise that will fix the problem.  \n&gt; **Me:** I can't promise that.   It will only fix the problem if the problem is caused by you using the wrong password.  \n&gt; **Borat:** So what do you think we should do to fix the problem?  \n&gt; **Me:** I can help you change your password.  But if that doesn't fix the problem you may need to take your computer to someone who actually fixes computers for a living.  But that person isn't me.  I can only help you with your connection.\n\nThere was a long, almost awkward silence.  For a moment I thought maybe my words had penetrated his skull.  Then...\n   \n&gt; **Borat:** I think you need to send a tech out to fix my computer.  \n&gt; **Me:** I--we...no, we don't do that.  If the problem is with your computer then you will take it to a tech.  \n&gt; **Borat:** My adapter just crashed.  \n&gt; **Me:** What do you mean?  \n&gt; **Borat:** In device manager.  My adapter now has a red exclamation point.  It didn't have that before I tried connecting to secure network.  It didn't have that before I ran your code.  Your code broke my computer.  \n&gt; **Me:** My code?  \n&gt; **Borat:** [indecipherable foreign language] IPCONFIG /RELEASE.  IPCONFIG /RENEW!  Your code broke my computer!  Computer worked fine before your call!  Computer worked fine at old apartment!!  You should send tech to fix my computer!!!!\n\nYou. Have. Got. To. Be. Kidding. Me.  \n\n&gt; **Me to Amelia:** May I transfer him to you?  \n&gt; **Amelia:** Yes.  \n\n&gt;**Me to Borat:** Sir, I think at this point I should transfer your call to my supervisor.  Is that okay?  \n&gt; **Borat:** Will she send tech?  \n&gt; **Me:** You'll need to discuss that with her.  \n&gt; **Borat:** Okay.\n\nI made the transfer.  And just like that, the worst call I have had since starting this job was over.  \n\n&gt; **Me** *(lays head on desk)***:** God, that guy was a nightmare.  \n&gt; **Walt:** Was he saying that you broke his computer?  \n&gt; **Me:** Yes, yes he was.  \n\nMeanwhile in the background...\n\n&gt; **Amelia:** Sir.  Sir...please listen.  IPCONFIG did not make any changes to your computer.  All it did was refresh your network connection. *(short pause)* Sir...sir... please, you're yelling and that makes it hard to understand you.  No. *(pause)* Sir, we don't --.  Sir...please --.  \n&gt;**Amelia:**  Well. Fine.  He hung up.  \n\nAnd here is hoping that is the last we hear from him.\n\n---\n\n[More stories from me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/search?q=author%3Asimality&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all)",

        "text": "So this tale takes place a couple of months ago. I was taking some time off work for personal reasons. I decided to ease back into work by doing a couple weeks of half-days, working from home. For the first few days, everything was great. Here are the players in this story.\n\n$me = me\n$boss = IT Director\n$org = Event \"Organizer\"\n$devLead = Lead Developer\n$pm = Project Manager for IT\n\nTL;DR at the bottom\n\nI get an email from $boss on Thursday that 4 people from the IT department were required to attend a conference we were hosting next week(around 500 people would attend). They wanted to have a help desk set up for people to get some help with their computer issues. Not the presenters mind you, just random users from our organization who just happened to be there. I was still scheduled to be out of the office and work from home for at least 1 week, but I decided to work the next week at the conference and work from home the following week. A minor inconvenience, but I can deal with that.\n\nThe next day(a Thursday I believe), I get an email from $org that read something like this:\n\n&gt; Hi $me and $boss, in addition to 4 people manning the help desk, we also need 8 laptops and projectors by Tuesday for the conference for all the side sessions we will have going. Thanks!\n\nSo at this point, I am pretty ticked. I could understand if this was a last minute thing, but this conference had been planned since the beginning of the year and we are hearing about the request for personnel and equipment for the first time less than a week prior to the event. So this means I have to go to the office Friday to get laptops, projectors, remote presenters, locks, and set up an auto login account (thanks PowerShell) for the conference.\n\nI manage to get everything together in one day and drop it off to $org. \n\n&gt; Thanks $me! I know this on such short notice. I'm sorry that I didn't notify you earlier, but I was going through notes from last time we did a conference like this and missed that we needed computers.\n\nI smile and say it's OK, and tell them I will see them at the event. The first day was a setup day and $boss told me I could still work from home and he would take care of the setup in the main area. Now on to day two.\n\nSo I get there early and see $org and they are visibly flustered. $org had forgotten the introductory video for the keynote speaker on a flash drive back in the office 45 minutes away. $org got hold of $boss and he agreed to swing by and pick it up on the way in. I ask if there is another copy we can grab from the network. $org thinks so, but I try to VPN from the wifi provided by the venue and no luck. I then try using my phone as a hotspot, and no dice. We try one more phone and still no luck. \n\nDoing what I did in the first place, we tried a reboot. Success! We get on the VPN, grab the file and we are all set. $org doesn't know if the video is the final edit, but we at least have something if $boss can't make it in time. $boss arrives a few minutes later, we drop off the flash drive and let $org decide which video to use.\n\nWe make our way down to the \"help desk\" area where $devLead and $pm are already situated and it is the same place where attendees register and pick up their packets. So we set up and for the first part of day 2, a member of the communications department is there having out packets and giving directions. We get maybe 1 or 2 computer questions and we are able to get at least some work done. Then after lunch we are all alone at the help desk area. So it comes down to us IT folk to hands people packets and give directions. The communications department presence was extremely sparse until the end of the event. I think they maybe were there 2 hours total after lunch on day 1.\n\nIn addition to that, we had the side sessions to set up. We were able to split that up thankfully, and got the rooms setup without much trouble. After the event, we locked the rooms and made sure the laptops were secured and went home.\n\nDay 3 comes along and we start the day with just us IT folks at the help desk area. We talk to a couple of users about one of our products coming out and have a nice conversation, but the day is just about the same. We give more directions and hand out packets while trying to get some real work done. At the end of the day, we pack up and have a nice steak dinner and call it a day.\n\nTL;DR I get called in from scheduled time off to setup equipment for an event that has been planned for months. $org decides to dedicate 4 IT people to essentially run a registration desk and give people directions.",

        "text": "Recently got together with some friends that I used to work with at a small computer repair shop, and this story came up.\n\nA gentleman came in one afternoon with some components in a grocery bag. He pulled out what I could only guess was some kind of a miniature motherboard, with several cables going every which way, and heat sink looking components that I had never seen before. The following conversation, as best as I recall it, ensued:\n\n&gt;Me: \"Hello sir, what can I do for you today\"\n\n&gt;Custo: \"I need to get this main board fixed, ya'll do that right?\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"We do offer some hardware repair, but if you don't mind my asking, exactly what system did you get this from?\"\n\n&gt;Custo: \"I have a hot tub at my house, and the jets wasn't working. A buddy of mine said to replace the main board, so here it is? Can you fix it?\"\n\n&gt;Me: \"I am not sure if this is something we could work on, I will go check with a technician.\"\n\nI took the 'main board' back to the techs, who, after a good laugh, showed it to the manager and told me to politely refuse to service the piece. The customer was not having it when I told him this. I do not remember what exactly what he said, as he got very angry, but he essentially tried to spin the blame onto us for him taking (my guess) a hammer to his hot tub, but I digress. \n\nThe manager came out and told him in as nice of a way as possible that shouting at us over something he did without bothering to get any type of professional support was useless, and to call a company that deals with hot tubs. I guess we lost a customer that day.",

        "text": "One of my (many) additional duties in Germany was serving as our HazCom/HazWaste/HazMat point of contact for our hangar.  Managing hazardous materials, the waste, and the required communication and training in Germany was almost a full-time job in and of itself, so naturally it fell to the poor engine guy who had nothing better to do when he wasn’t busy [wasting his time making a tool room database.](https://redd.it/73smwu) With minimal training, zero experience and far too many threats about just who goes to jail in Germany for an environmental infraction (fun fact—the guy running the program, Private-then-Specialist ZeeWulf…) I worked my job with foolish enthusiasm and glee.  \n\nOf course, it was where I discovered having a clipboard in my hands made me immune to work details, so deathly fear of environmental law violations aside I’d say I came out a winner…\n\nAs part of those duties, I had to ensure our cabinets stayed stocked at all times and I would beg, borrow, trade and ~~steal~~ creatively source whatever we needed to keep our helicopters flying.  In fact, I spent three days driving across Bavaria trying to track down a gallon of paint because our commander wanted all the container doors to match.  (I found it eventually…and then discovered they had it at the paint shop across the airfield from us, but the fellow running the shop didn’t understand what I’d come by looking for…)  Often enough, these hunts were much simpler—our Headquarters Supply section would actually have an order come in and I’d borrow the company supply tractor, a little John Deere yard tractor, and their trailer to go pick it up over at the fuel depot.\n\nOne bright, beautiful German day, I arrive over at the Fuelers.  Supply usually asked me to fill up the tractor while I was over there anyway, and this day was no different.  In fact, $FuelerSPC was busy conducting a training session for their brand new privates, $PVTSnuffy &amp; Skippy. \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “Hey, $FuelerSPC, can I get this filled up while I’m here?”\n\n&gt;**$FuelerSPC** “Sure!  Though could you do me a favor?  Can you run the fuel nozzle while I teach these guys how to use the truck?”\n\nI agree, open the tank and hold the nozzle so that the fuel would gently pour from the tank in the truck into the tank opening with the truck at a low engine idle—The nozzle itself was the same diameter as the fuel tank neck so it couldn’t actually be inserted inside.  I hold the nozzle there while squeezing the handle, though nothing is flowing out, while $FuelerSPC explains how to work the truck side.  However, when he pulled on the control handle at the back of the fuel truck, nothing happened.  No fuel, no engine, nothing.  He fiddled with a couple settings for a moment and then turned to the two privates.\n\n&gt;**$FuelerSPC** “Don’t.  Touch.  ANYTHING.”\n\nHe ran forward to the cab and started the truck and began to adjust some settings up there.  Out of the corner of my eye, though, I saw the Good Idea Fairy alight upon $PVTSkippy’s shoulder.  And then, before I realized what was about to happen, Skippy’s hand had closed around the control handle.  In response, the truck kicked into High Idle and immediately sent a high pressure stream of fuel down the hose…and into the little five-gallon tank on the tractor.\n\nI’m not sure how many gallons were lost, but I suspect it was more than five but less than ten.  It couldn’t have been running like that for more than a couple of seconds.  What I do know is that I was soaked, head to toe in JP8—diesel jet fuel.  \n\nI’ll give $FuelerSPC credit, he didn’t stop to berate $PVTSkippy and instead had $PVTSnuffy run to the eyewash station.  $PVTSnuffy ran back with two half-gallon bottles of eye wash which he promptly doused my head with.  After clearing my face with some offered paper towels I opened my eyes to see the majority of the fuelers all standing around me, grinning.\n\n&gt;**$FuelerSPC** “Congratulations, ZeeWulf, you’re one of us, now!”\n\n***\n&gt;**$PlatoonSergeant**  “What the hell happened to you?”\n\n\nHe sniffed the air, the stench of fuel rolling off of me.  \n\n\n&gt;**$ZeeWulf**  “I guess I’m a fueler now.”\n\n\n&gt;**$PlatoonSergeant**  “Go home, get a shower!”\n\n\nI sat under that shower for almost two hours but didn’t stop smelling JP8 for several days.  \n",

As it's an insurance company the security protocols are super strict for both us and the customers. If we don't keep the security guidelines all hell is set loose.\n\n \nSo on one of my first days taking calls this super-old sounding guy with a horrible bavarian accent calls. For those who might not know bavarian german (which sounds pretty close to austrian) : Imagine this guy's accent to be pretty close to Hitler's.\n\n\n**ME** &gt; Good day, here's  *Nameofcompany* Tech Support, my name is starla_s, how may I help you?  \n**guywithhitlervocie** [literally shouting] &gt; MY COMPUTER KEEPS WRITING EVERYTHING WITH CAPITAL LETTERS!  \n**ME** &gt; Ok sir, please, give me your username so I can validate you and then we can take a look at the problem.  \n**guywithhitlervocie** &gt; *MENSCHENSKINDER!!*   \n[this is a rather old german swear-word. Like...mid-century kind of old.A bit as if someone was shouting 'BOLLOCKS' or 'DARN YOU' or something similar]   \n&gt; I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT, I CANNOT SEND E-MAILS, EVERYTHING IS IN CAPITAL LETTERS! MENSCHENSKINDER!!!  \n**ME** &gt; Sorry sir, for security reasons I first need your username, I promise we will do our best to fix the problem as soon as I have validated you.  \n**guywithhitlervocie** *tells me a username, keeps shouting \n**ME** &gt; Uh, excuse me, sir, but this username is registered on a lady's name..?   \n**guywithhitlervocie**&gt; YES THAT'S MY WIFE BUT SHE'S HAVING LUNCH. WHAT ABOUT THAT E-MAIL?! THE E-MAIL CANNOT BE SENT, IT WON'T WORK, EVERYTHING IS IN CAPITAL LETTERS!   \n**ME** &gt; I'm really sorry, sir, but I'm prohibited from continuing this conversation with you if you don't have a personal username. If you could perhaps hand the phone to your wife we could....  \n**guywithhitlervocie**&gt; *MENSCHENSKINDER* WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT, THIS IS A DISASTER, I HAVE TO SEND THIS E-MAIL, YOU HAVE TO START A REMOTE CARE SESSION ON THIS COMPUTER RIGHT NOW!!  \n**ME** &gt; I apologize, this is our process, but..have you tried pushing the capslo....  \n**guywithhitlervocie**&gt; MENSCHENSKINDER!!!!\nHe hung up.   \n\n\nWe get idiotic calls every day but it's seldom that users spend the whole of a call shouting. I think he was my first ever shouting user, so I won't forget him.\n",

        "text": "I’m not tech support, I’m the user in the story, but I had a fun one happen to me today that I think you guys might like.\n\nI’ve been having issues with printing for awhile. Whenever I print in color, the colors come out bizarre. Blues seemed to be fine In general, but colors were weird, especially reds and greens. This was mostly an issue when printing pictures of people and the like, as their skin tones would just look crazy orange and blotchy. \n\nI called the printer tech to come over. He spent about an hour testing the printer and said it was fine, that it must be a computer issue. He checked the drivers and they were correct, so he said I needed to call my tech support and work on it from that end. \n\nLike I said, I’m not tech support, but I’m a millennial and I like to think I know the basics of trouble shooting to try before calling tech support. I like to think I am a considerate user in that regard (I spend a lot of time reading your stories on here! I feel for you guys). \nRestarting the computer, trying to print from different programs to see if it was just pdfs or if everything was affected. Tried printing from someone else’s computer and the color was fine. Knew I hadn’t installed any new drivers or anything new to my computer at all other than fonts, which should not be relevant. Just little things so tech support doesn’t have to go through the most basic steps. (To be honest I’m shocked that he believed me when I told him I restarted my computer!)\n\nSo I call tech support and this helpful guy remotes in. I’m printing a copy and scanning it back to my email so he can see what it looks like, he’s checking the drivers, reinstalling them, etc to no avail. We try printing to our only other color printer, it’s better but the colors are still off. He goes into all these places to check all these different color calibrations and color settings in my computer, basically everywhere you can do that, resetting them, etc. Even though we know the display shouldn’t affect the printing color, we try everything color related just in case. We restart my computer several times during the process as a result of changes he makes. I step away every now and then as he tries various things. We’re on the phone for at least an hour. Eventually he emails himself the pdf we are testing, says he’s printing a copy from his end and one from mine, and I should go check to see if they are the same. \n\nVoila, the colors came out perfect in both copies!\n\n“What magic voodoo did you perform???” I ask him jokingly. \n\nHe pulls up the print dialogue box. “You see this little box here?” He asks, moving the mouse. “You had the ‘save on toner and ink’ box checked. That was the problem.”\n\nWow was I mortified. I definitely never intentionally clicked that box. Worst part is...I was going to make some conversation at one point and ask him “hey so what kind of tickets are more fun for you, something puzzling like this or simple problems borne of user stupidity?” Thank god I was distracted by something or other.\n\nThe only thing saving me from total shame is the knowledge that the tech support guy also had trouble figuring it out, and it took him over an hour to realize that box was checked after we printed from that dialogue box so many times.\n\nMoral of the story, I hear It from you guys time and again - you can spend all this time looking for a “complicated” solution to a weird-ass problem, but all too often the answer has been staring you in the face the entire time. \n\nDude, if you read this, you’re the man! Thanks for figuring it out!",
