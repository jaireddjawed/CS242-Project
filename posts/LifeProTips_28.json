Something that is overlooked though is the idea of passive exercise. This is the form of exercise done with less effort and usually involves a choice that you stick to subconsciously, such as choosing the stairs instead of elevator, using a standing desk, biking to work, or watching TV on the elliptical. Little opportunities like this are everywhere and after getting into the habit of doing them you will hardly notice the difference in terms of difficulty. Even so, they will pay off immensely in the long run since you are exercising much more throughout the day without even being aware of it. Also, by including passive exercise, you will actually perform much better at active exercise too, since your body is more conditioned to exercise throughout the day.",

        "text": "Many websites and apps give you the option to input a discount/promo/voucher code before finishing your purchase but doing a simple Google search may not be enough to find a valid discount code.\nUsually he top results on google are exclusively coupon aggregator websites, personally they never work for me with all the codes being unusable.\n\n Here are some tricks I use to find a code that actually works.\n\n-First simply google [website] + [promo code] + [current year] you might even be able to spot a code right in the search result description.\n-Within Google search options, try changing the date of the results from \"all time\" to \"past month/week\".\nThis will show you more recent results that may contain a barely used and recent promo code.\n-Try looking through the images tab!\nSome websites post an ad as an image that contains a promo code, it won't be explicitly written in plain text on the facebook/blog post and might not show up while doing a regular search.\n-You can also try to google [promo code] + [site:nameOfWebsite.com] \nSometimes a website takes down a post and you can't access the URL by normal search or by navigating through links on the website. \nSearching the website directly with this command can show you hidden URLs. Once I even found a white page containing dozens of promo codes in plain text.\n-If you find a working promo code that has a number like \"promo5\"\ntrying multiple variations with higher numbers, for example: \"promo30\" could yield a bigger discount.\n-Generic holiday/event codes might also work!\nSome examples: \"SUMMER2023\" \"WEEKEND10\" \"VALENTINES23\" \"10OFF\" \"HOLIDAY20\" \"FEB23SALE\" etc.\n-calling support or sending an e-mail to the company directly.\nHaven't tried it myself but I know some people who were successful by simply being polite and asking for a small discount.\n\nThese tricks only increase your chance of you finding a valid discount code, I've been doing this for years and some times there is no discount at this time on this particular website, if you spent half an hour hunting for a discount and you only got 5$ off (or nothing at all) you just wasted your time.\nOver the years I probably saved thousands of dollars \n\n\n*I know that slickdeals, honey and similar services exist, but for me doing a manual search usually gets me better results.",

        "text": "With inflation and profiteering running rampant lately companies are raising prices faster and more frequently than they can manage. Many places particularly fast food chains, liquor stores and grocery stores are raising prices in the system but not on the stickers or menus. The price will be listed as one thing but when you go to pay they will charge more. Look out for this and if you catch them doing it most often they will honour the sticker price.\n\nThis has happened to me several times in the last few months. It seems like it's easy for companies to raise prices in the system, but changing the stickers requires actual time and effort. Given that many people don't notice, it's very convenient for them to 'forget' to update the stickers for a while, at least until somebody notices.",

        "text": "If you want a pet, aren't sure if it's for you, definitely apply to foster animals for your local shelter. Fostering is temporary housing of an animal, usually for a shelter -- like pet sitting but with different responsibilities.\n\nAnimals are not toys. But, the realities are, **there are a lot of reasons somebody may not be ready for pet ownership, but may still want to provide pet care to animals.** For instance -- I might move in the next few years, to another state a ways away. I do not want to make an animal have to take that move with me and readjust, so I am not currently in the market for animals that have a lifespan of over 2 years. I also may be returning to college, which will be a huge time sink, so I may not have time in the future to dedicate to an animal.\n\n**Fostering animals gives them:**\n\n* A bigger, better, more enriched daily life\n* More attention from people and from the same people each day\n* A break from shelter life\n* Rehabituation to a private home environment (adapting to home life after shelter life can be hard -- so this eases the transition) \n* Exposure to new people and types of people (for example, a household with kids can help a shelter assess whether a certain cat is child friendly)\n* A chance at rehabilitation in terms of correction of problem behaviors (for example, training a Guinea pig not to bite people)\n\nFostering animals makes them more adoptable because it makes them both more adoptable via surface value, but also adoptable to more potential families. A family might like a certain dog, but if the dog is bad with kids, it won't be a good fit for that specific adoptive home.\n\nFostering also frees up cages at animal shelters. A shelter will be better prepared, logistically, for mass intakes of animals as part of law enforcement situations or hoarding situations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Benefits for fosterers:**\n\n* No purchase price or adoption fee for an animal\n* No long-term commitment to pet ownership\n* Shelters usually provide training and support\n* Shelters may also provide supplies, making fostering less expensive than ownership\n* Shelters may also provide medical care and grooming for foster animals, ensuring an animal that is healthy and clean enters your home and that it stays healthy and hygenic\n* Ability to practice caring for a variety of species and breeds\n* Ability to try caring for a specific animal before making the decision to adopt the animal or not\n* Volunteer hours may be valuable somehow, e.g. for school credit\n* No need to travel to and be in a shelter to help shelter animals\n* Fosters may get free, discounted, or priority placement in the adoption queue for all animals at the shelter or the animal they are specifically fostering\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reasons to foster:**\n\n* Financial\n* Seeing if pet ownership can realistically be integrated into their lifestyle\n* Seeing if they have the mental and physical health required to care for various animals\n* No need to surrender an animal, e.g. inability to find housing that is pet-friendly\n* Make sure all members of the household are ready to be good pet owners\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fostering challenges:**\n\n* Learning to care for new species or new individual animals\n* Communicating efficiently and quickly to shelter emails or phone calls in regards to, for instance, adoption inquiries regarding the foster animal\n* Saying 'goodbye' to the animal when it gets adopted\n* Emotional concerns regarding caring for special needs or vulnerable animals\n* Limit to the variety and breeds of animals available for foster (e.g. someone dead-set on fostering a Wheaten terrier will have very slim pickings)\n* Caring for special needs animals (shelters do not 'make' anyone care for a special needs animal, but even people who agree to do so may find it difficult in various ways)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About me:**\n\nI usually post on my alt, /u/heather1999xyz . I am a Guinea pig fosterer who fosters them via my local shelter, the Animal Rescue League of Boston. **I am not a shelter volunteer, representative, staff member, investor, or associate of the Animal Rescue League of Boston.** They're a shelter I support and believe in, but I am not solicited by the ARL to make any social media posts, nor am I paid to do so. I do this as an independent citizen who happens to foster Guinea pigs, and who happens to foster them via the ARL.\n\n**Why I foster personally:**\n\n* Low long-term time commitment, given I cannot predict what I'll be doing for the next 7+ years (Guinea pigs can live up to 8 years, and most of the ones I've seen at the shelter are currently around a year old)\n* Works with my weird vampire schedule\n* No need to physically go to a shelter\n* Relatively flexible care schedule, given Guinea pigs do not get taken on walks outside\n* Cultural and religious reasons\n* I'm good at it (which is genuinely surprising to me) both in terms of rehabilitating animals with negative behaviors,  as well as taking care of animals with special needs, e.g. poor vision\n* I'm good at finding them adopters. I've fostered 16 Guinea pigs since 8.19.22. I placed 9 of my fosters. I placed an additional 9 Guinea pigs that I had not fostered.\n* My husband and I aren't strongly cat or dog people, so we wanted to foster a species that doesn't get many foster inquiries\n* Practice with general animal care experience as well as rodent care in general, with Guinea pigs specifically",
