        "text": "Hello. I've cut contact from my Nparents and their religious group a couple of years ago. Part of their teachings included never being allowed to leave the house, though they did allow me to get a university degree when I finished high school. I've had a few training gigs at a few workplaces here and there, but I always end up getting really bad anxiety and quitting a couple of weeks into the job. I basically have two degrees but with barely any proper experience. These jobs were before and after I cut ties with my family. It's also not to do with how boring/fun those jobs are. Cause I've had once in a lifetime experiences with some of those, and my studies and the jobs I did were very fulfilling. I quit anyway because it gets too daunting.\n\nBecause of controlling my family were, it was always a terrifying thing leaving the house. 'What if I get caught?' 'What if they see me with this coworker and they assume I'm up to no good?' And most of all 'what if I do something embarrassing &gt; shame the family &gt; I end up getting punished?' My Nparents REALLY took their reputations seriously, and everything they deemed not fit was a ticket to me getting severly punished. I think you can sort of imagine the type of baggage that comes with that.\n\nI'm now free of that, but I still struggle with leaving the house and being around people. The trauma left from all that still impacts my day to day life. I'm almost 30, and I've never had a job. Not even like.. at a Mcdonalds. I've been sheltered and raised to be obedient housewife material. When I was a teenager/early twenties I did make some money out of freelancing. The freelancing gig has nothing to do with my university degrees or the training that I took. The gig was easy to do because my family had no idea about it + I rarely had to interact with people or leave the house. It's been years though, and I don't think that line of work is viable for me anymore (in terms of paying bills now) because it took me years of networking from scratch in order to build up a small customer base.\n\nThough I have welfare support, I still need to work in order to cover more expenses, but the thought of me working or leaving the house is incredibly daunting. When I looked up advice online from jobseekers, I think most people don't really get it?... I didn't choose to not work out of laziness... I can't exactly describe why I feel so afraid and ashamed. I do have paranoia when I leave my home, watching my back and every corner to see if maybe my family is there and about to lunge at me (though I KNOW that is very unlikely). But I don't think that's the whole reason why I'm afraid.\n\nI don't wish to share too many details about how I was raised. If there is anybody with the same experiences as me, I'd like to hear any advice or at least to know I'm not alone here. I am also a refugee, since I had to flee my homecountry to escape my family. I don't know if that's a good idea to mention in my resume or not, since someone told me it might get the employer to empathize. Otherwise it would look bad on my resume if I don't have a lot of paid work experiences or refrence contacts listed, especially ones from the country I fled from (which I don't want to list because I don't want people from there to find me).",

The worst part is, is that no one else understands (besides my therapist). Friends and family are so frustrated from me going back to her so many times that they yell at me \"just stay away from her, wtf is so hard about that??\". Like it's that simple. It seems like my life is divided into before meeting her and after. I went somewhere the other day and remembered how happy I use to be before her. She still tries to contact me and says she wants me to still be apart of her life even if we aren't in a relationship.  Sorry, I guess I had to vent.

        "text": "TL;DR: I am still haunted by my breakup with an ex narc friend and I feel like nobody will ever understand what I went through. Give me hope?\n\nIt's been 1.5 years for me after I ended a friendship with a narc friend who was heavily obsessed with me. After I ended things, he got people (who I was perfectly fine with) to block me, and even had me kicked out of a large dating group on Facebook shortly after. While I don't have proof of that, I know it was a group he used to be in (he was not when I joined), and I never interacted or known anyone on that group since I created my socials only a week before the breakup, and haven't had any online presence for around 6 years. When I got kicked out, I saw that he was back in. There is virtually no other explanation.\n\nWhen I told people about everything he did to me - even showed screenshots - people seemed to think I was overreacting and not believe me that he was so calculated and vindictive. Only two of my best friends noticed his behavior over the years (one even flat out called him a narcissist before I even knew what that meant). However, those two friendships have fallen apart in the last year, as I have gotten very sensitive and managed to shut them out and lost my two only witnesses that I dealt with a complete psychopath.\n\nI want to date again, but I'm terrified of the rumors that he must have spread and I keep playing scenarios in my head in which I explain my future date about the abuse that I went through. Thing is, after losing my only evidence (friends) who knew about this, I feel like nobody would ever understand the amount of psychopathy that I had to deal with. Even people that truly love me seem to not accept what I tell them, no matter how calm I talk about this.\n\nSo to those who are dating again, what did you do about this?\n\n1. Did you ever tell your new partner about the narc abuse? Or did you prefer to never mention it?\n2. If so, how did you do it?\n3. How did they react?\n\nThe narc made me feel like everything I say or do can be used against me, and that telling/sharing people of what he did to me would only make me look like a bad person that is holding grudge. This shit haunts me to this day.\n\nThanks.",

[https://np.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/yx1a9m/holy\\_shit\\_covert\\_narcissists\\_are\\_the\\_absolute/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/yx1a9m/holy_shit_covert_narcissists_are_the_absolute/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nI'll keep this one short(er). there are things in the aftermath that are *extremely* stereotypical for an abuser and predator--I was immediately accused of harassment in multiple reddit posts as soon as I caught him violating consent, catfishing and dehumanisingly using trans people for sexual exploitation. I will chew you out multiple times and a half for exploitation, abuse and predatory behaviour (especially because he was using a space with very vulnerable people, mostly minors, to bolster his predatory baiting), and I'm sure every single person who has dealt with a narcissist knows the good old \"this is harassment\" when they're rightfully held accountable and made to confront their harm and abuse. Him playing victim and looking for support because he is \"being harassed\" right after I caught him and called him out is also straight out of the narcissist abuser handbook--also not shocked.\n\nThis one is new, however: when I spoke to this guy, I explicitly set a hard boundary that I would never enter a committed relationship without meeting someone first and was aggressive about it. I need to suss out gut feelings and how someone interacts with the world before doing this. After abruptly discarding, this guy is now referring to me as his \"ex\" and \"boyfriend\" consistently in multiple spaces. He did this as a comment under a streamer influencer to get him to notice him while exploiting my racial pain and trauma for \"anti-racist\" clout (he is a vile racist--says he is \"formerly far-right\" but he's just dialled it down a little without doing any work). Other posts are talking about how his \"ex boyfriend\" is harassing him. I've never dealt with someone making up an entire relationship with me before, especially a whole adult whom I have never even met. Aside from trying to get clout and anti-racist points, part of it is of course trying to get an ego boost as a covert narcissist from lying to others and deluding himself that he isn't dogshit enough to actually have a functional relationship/that he \"gets guys\".  There is no way I would ever date someone like him, and from what I gathered from his sob stories--it's pretty easy to pick up on his predatory creepy personality in person because people irl around him \"seem to leave for no reason\". \n\nNonetheless, this is truly next level. I can't imagine the level of covert narcissist and sheer pathetic loser you need to be to make up whole entire boyfriends *against* their consent, and it's so creepy and exploitative just by and of itself.",

        "text": "Has anyone else experienced this? I am the guest for a few weeks of a friend I've become close with in the last couple years. We live about 4 hours from each other. My landlord had a family emergency and needed the room I was renting in his home. It was all very sudden and during the holidays. My friend, who lives alone, said I could stay with her for a few weeks while I figured out my plan to move back. I was very grateful!\n\nI was discarded years ago by a N who had been one of my closest friends for a long time. What is weird that my current friend who this post is about, is like a reincarnation of the N friend as far as personality. My current friend is like the old one but without the Krazy and the drama. They both have BIG personalities and are very good with making you feel special to them, including people they just met. They both show a lot of interest in getting to know new people on a level that you don't normally see. Most people don't have that kind of intense curiosity about others! Both are so super friendly that people gravitate to them.\n\nUnlike the old friend, the new one is much more stable (she owns her home and is responsible, while the other was a hot mess). The new one has long standing relationships and is on good terms with her ex husband. Besides him though, I think I am the only person to stay in her home for such a long time, and when you live with someone that's when you really get to know them!\n\nThere have been different things have given me pause since I've been here and that remind me of my former friend. One example would be me repeatedly urging her to accompany me to a really beautiful park in her city that she's never seen. One day she replied that Yes, she has decided to go, but with some other friend I've never heard of. She had no interest in going to the park before my arrival. This kind of insensitivity reminded me of the ex friend. She is Jewish and invited some new people for Shabbat dinner but did not invite me, even though I am staying in her home. I only found out about it a few hours before when she came home with bags of groceries and I asked about them as she doesn't cook. She will talk on the phone to others about family &amp; friends flying in during the time I am her guest but not tell me they're coming, as though I am not important enough to warrant this courtesy. I found out in this way that her brother is coming in a few days.\n\nSo the other night I was updating her on my moving plans back to my city and was caught off guard when she began making deflating comments, saying that because my city is expensive (it is) I might have to move somewhere else. She said that moving back to my city may be unrealistic, though suddenly scrapping this and figuring out an entirely new place to move in a couple of weeks and where I don't want to live anyway, IS realistic! Okay...\n\nShe said that I need to plan for the worst case scenario, since I couldn't afford to live there before (no idea where she was getting this from). This is what SHE would do because SHE doesn't want to be dependent on others. Her tone was judgy and unsupportive. It felt like she was undermining me out of nowhere and it was making me suddenly doubt myself. I questioned afterwards if I was being overly sensitive but I don't think I was. If someone wants to offer criticism or tough love kinda feedback, they can totally do so in a supportive way. What she said felt passive aggressive. I think you can feel the intentions behind someone's words.\n\nNow I am thinking about moving back early which is a bummer but I am reluctant to stay with someone whose starting to create that walking on eggshells feeling.\n\nHave you had this kind of thing happen with a friend or someone close to you? Did they turn out to be Narcissistic?",

So far my son is thriving and living him best life because after leaving him, I‚Äôm the best version of myself and there‚Äôs no toxicity in our lives.

Anytime I here from him ( being an urgent or crucial case where communication is needed)- I always tense up, go into flight and fight mode, and feel very distrustful in what he says. With him, I never know his true intentions, what mood he‚Äôll be in, or what I‚Äôm going against. I wish I wouldn‚Äôt be so rattled up by him.

I can't remember if that was month 7 or 8. It doesn't feel as important anymore, which is huge progress for me.\n\nI've been no contact the entire time. Haven't received any hoovers (that I am aware of). Been working HARD on myself, my boundary game with people in general. Worked a lot on my self care and re-establishing my self-trust and self-respect. Going very good so far.\n\nI've remained abstinent (dating, sex, etc) the whole time. Since the experts recommend a full year without dating, that was my goal. Meanwhile I've decided to keep going and I'm not interested in pursuing relationships going forward, and I'm really happy and content with that decision. I'm just having a lot of fun doing my own thing on my own time with my sanity restored, hanging with friends and indulging in my solo hobbies and interests. I'm incredibly proud of myself.\n\nThe new year also gave me renewed energy and I've been extra happy this month, and looking forward to what the year brings!\n\nI don't know if I'll update during month 11 but I'll probably write a thorough reflection when it's been a whole year, and share it. Why? Because this sub has been INVALUABLE in my recovery and reading other people's testimonies \"from the other side\" of their Narc situations, has been so inspiring and motivating.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask. I wish you all a pleasant day and just know that IT DOES GET BETTER as long as you stay no contact, show yourself compassion and patience and work on yourself, whatever that means for you.",

        "text": "I posted this to another subreddit without many responses, so I‚Äôll try here too. TLDR: how do you date and learn to trust yourself and others after a long term relationship with a narcissist \n\nI 28F separated from my fianc√© 33M almost a year and a half ago. He was an undiagnosed narcissist and we were together for almost 5 years (met when I was 22 and he was 27). I was young and naive, I was a single mom to a 2 year old, and I thought I met the man of my dreams. He took on being a father right away, we went on fancy dinner dates, went out as a family on trips and romantic vacations alone, and he proposed with my dream ring 2 years into the relationship in front of my family. He promised to have kids with me. His family loved me and my family loved him. He had a good job and I really thought I was set in life. \n\nAfter we got engaged, everything changed. We went on a trip to Mexico with another couple and he was jealous of the other guy the entire time. He criticized how much we spoke or if I laughed at a joke he made he said I was flirting. We got in a physical altercation and I broke up with him on the spot. He begged me back for hours and promised he wouldn‚Äôt do it again. I took him back. The next 3 years were a living hell. He slowly had higher and higher expectations of me. He wanted me to do all the domestic labour, despite me working and going to school. He stopped paying for expensive dates and if he did, I owed him. He would ruin birthdays and Christmas. My big moments he would post about on Facebook before I got the chance to steal the limelight from me. He began gambling and drinking a lot, not coming home for hours after he was done work and when he finally did, he would yell at me that we ate without him. I gained like 30lbs from the stress and he started harassing me about what I was eating and would demand I go to the gym (he was slowly gaining weight too, also about 30lbs, as you do, and refused to join me at the gym or eat better food with me). He criticized my parenting and said my daughter was too sensitive and clingy. He said he no longer wanted children with me because I would make more clingy children, and if I ever got pregnant he would never help take care of them or raise them, that would be up to me because I would be the only one who wanted another kid. We had a wedding planned and pushed it back, I blamed it on Covid but I started to feel unsure in the back of my mind. When I would finally break down and tell him things need to change, he would change back to his old self no problem. But if I did anything to offend him, and I mean anything, he would go right back to criticizing and being drunk and leaving me to do everything. I started to get allergic reactions that were stress related and severely impacted my health and when he wasn‚Äôt there for me with doctors offices or hospital visits, I knew I was ready to have the talk with him. I begged him to go to therapy, as I thought his upbringing had made him into a narcissist. He told me he would never go to therapy, I was the one with problems and that‚Äôs why I went to therapy. I knew then I was done. He wasn‚Äôt going to change back to the man I had met. \n\nAnyways, we broke up almost a year and a half ago. I packed all his shit into the garage, he came and got it, begged for me back with a smirk on his face, showing me paperwork from a therapist stating he wasn‚Äôt a narcissist. I didn‚Äôt read it. We had some communication a few times as we had some finances to separate but I basically let him take anything he wanted. The house was mine. I haven‚Äôt had contact with him in about 6 months and I plan to keep it that way. I had my sister move in to help with my 8 year old and to help with bills, and life is a lot more calm and over time my daughter is doing better mentally, and I‚Äôm no longer as sick physically, and of course I easily was able to drop the little bit of weight I had put on. \n\nBut even with all these positives, I feel like I can‚Äôt move on from what happened. I have tried to date and I find men terrify me now. I don‚Äôt feel I can trust their intentions. One small infraction with a new man and I immediately get grossed out and end things. I feel like everything is a sign towards selfishness. I‚Äôm scared to further hurt my daughter with another man again as she doesn‚Äôt trust men and doesn‚Äôt like being around them. I would like to get married one day and have a life partner, I might even want more kids with the right person, but I feel like I won‚Äôt be able to get there with how I feel towards men. Any advice or hope that I‚Äôll get through this would be appreciated.",

If I do something nice you will not keep yelling at me about what I did.\n\nc) Sidetrack you from figuring out what I am up to\n\nd) Lovebombing. \n\nSIDENOTE if you are honest about number 1. It is real eye opener. My Ex scored a 1. That one point is not enough to hold on to the romantic feelings. \n\n2) Do not abuse or misuse the lingo. A lot of people post something like help my Ex has new supply. Here is why that can be a problem. First if you just think of yourself as supply for people that can be very dehumanizing and keep you stuck in victimhood. Or prone to more abuse. Here is the second reason why that can be problematic, People interchange supply with bf or gf with supply. The problem is this , the phrase supply by definition tells you it is something that is not permeant , Because most supply of things run out. There fore if you actually know the definition of the lingo , you know the end result of your NPD toxic person relationship status, meaning that shiny new girl or guy is not permeant.\n\n3) Tip 2. You deserve closure. And reasons why the left. And reasons why they abused you like they did. The reality is this , you can make your own closure. If Person A makes you feel bad about yourself. And they abuse you, if they do not correct it, they are bad person. There is your closure. A lot of times we hang around longer than we should thinking, they will come around, I will get answers. The reality is that you are not going to get answers from them, unless something is in it for them, and a lot times, they may trick you into thinking you will get answers just to take one more crack at abusing you. The point is this, when it is over , leave , do not stick around waiting to have that conversation of why , when its not going to happen without a steep price tag.\n\n4)  Tip 3 . Focus on you and your happiness. First your Ex if they are happy it is either temporary or not real. They lack introspection so they are going to pretend that the relationship is great until they find someone else, and repeat the pattern. A lot of times people get sucked into illusions. What if my Ex changes for the new person. Reality check times two. They will not. You are witnessing lovebombing from the other side. And if they change for new person that is indicator that they are at least sociopath. Making amends with your past , is part of true change.",

        "text": "So, I was in various rock and metal bands for years. Mostly my ex hated going to shows or bars. She started going to shows when I started a metal band with two of our daughters. (side note, I realize now that made her look good)\n\nThat's when she found a new love (alcohol). My friends became her friends. Covid happened, music and bars were shut down, the girls and I decided to end the band for the time being. Bars opened back up, the ex went back to the bar we used to frequent. Things between us were pretty bad at this point. I had been devalued several years back, but I was still her supply, but that was changing. She was getting what she needed from alcohol and her new flirty drinking friends. Not me. I didn't drink. She left, discarded me and the kids. None of those people at the bar reached out to me. None. In fact, when I reached out to a couple of them, they had no idea why I wasn't around anymore. They didn't know the separation or divorce happened. The ex wasn't saying anything.\n\nI have no idea what she's said, but at this point, all the bar friends know it's over, and she and another friend are dating. So everyone knows we aren't together anymore. But they don't seem to care.\n\nBut what do they think happened? I assume i'm the asshole in everyone's mind, because again, no one has reached out. My suspicion is that she claims I am the Narcissist. She tried to convince me of that a few times, but when I pressed her, she had no idea what a Narcissist really was.\n\nAlso, those people are a bunch of drunks. Mostly just focused on complaining about work and drinking. Many of them have been frequenting that bar for years. Not my thing, so I'm actually fine about all that. Messed up a little by being discarded and forgotten by people I thought actually enjoyed my company, but fine.\n\nA show is coming up where I'm interested in going and watching a couple bands I like. I am anxious about how weird it's gonna be. It's probably gonna be weird. Well, unless I don't let it. But it's who I am. I can't bullshit like those people. I don't want to. I'd rather talk about deep stuff. I'd rather connect. But I know I shouldn't really pursue that. \n\nLast time I swung by the bar to watch a specific band's reunion show, one of the bartenders told me he missed me. That I just \"disappeared\". I tried to change the subject, but he kept going, so I told him I felt like I had to \"disappear\". He suddenly changed his tone and didn't want to talk about things. Weird.\n\nSo, the real point of me writing this is: why am I still making it easy for her to not feel terrible. She has moved on. I haven't been going to shows because I don't want to be around her. But if I was there, she would be uncomfortable. Especially if people started asking me what happened. So, it's like I've made it easy for her to tell whatever story she wants, because I'm not there to defend, or set shit straight. I don't want revenge. I also don't want those bar people to be my \"friends\". They aren't the type of people I want in my life. Especially since they dropped me so easily. They should feel terrible too.\n\nThe show is in February, so I have plenty of time to decide.\n\nBut the fact is, I feel the need to find out what kind of smearing she's been doing. But why do I care? Do I really want this? The people I thought were my friends dropped me and probably have no thoughts of me. Why do I care.\n\nIt's because I've been slighted. Speared. At least that's my suspicion. They either don't care, or can't because it's too emotional and conflicting and most people don't know how to deal with hard shit.\n\nI think the healthiest thing for me to do is only go to that show if I'm not still trying to prop up my ego. To convince people I'm not an asshole, or whatever it is that she told them. But I don't care. Well, I don't want to care.\n\nRando: \"Hey man, where have you been? What have you been up to?\"\n\nMe: \"The kids are doing well. It's been a difficult couple of years, but we are connecting and growing. I'm healing and moving into a good place. One day at a time.\"\n\nRando: \\*\\*crickets\\*\\*\n\nor\n\nMe: \"Oh, same old shit! and you?\"\n\nRando: \"Well, me, me, me, me, me, blah, blah, blah blah, drunk story, same drunk story again.\"\n\nI've still got a ways to go, I admit.",

        "text": "I have been helped very much by the narcissistic community in learning how to deal with my narcissist landlords. I was able to apply good advice given to me on how to handle the situation, when they started their smear campaign at the LTB hearing the other day. I was expecting a  slanderous smear campaign  and all sorts of toxicity from them, and they behaved as predicted. However, I was able to remain professional in light of their narcissistic rages, their gaslighting, and their smear campaign.\n\nI took them to court for various violations of the housing law, and they were exposed in a negative light which narcissists cannot tolerate. \n\nAt the pre amp the landlords logged out of the hearing. So the hearing went uncontested for over an hour. I was presenting the merits of the case for over an hour, and suddenly the landlords logged back into the zoom hearing.  They claimed that the zoom app glitched and they were unable to get back into the meeting. The adjudicator and my self clearly exhausted from over an hour of uncontested hearing, had to restart. I was very exhausted because I had been awake for over 24 hours.\n\nThe adjudicator told me that she had to restart the hearing over because if she didnt the landlords can request a review. I raised the point that the notice of hearing clearly gives parties information on how to call into the zoom hearing with their phones. if the zoom app crashes. The adjudicator disagreed with me and restarted the hearing. \n\nIn mediation and in the hearing room, the landlords attempted to take over the hearing, which was a T2 application.  Accusing me of not paying rent for January 2023, even though I had a rent reciept and even put it up on screen. The court staff and the adjudicator told the landlords that the hearing was a T2 hearing, and that they cannot raise other issues in the hearing. \n\nFinally we got into mediation the landlords had to be muted by the dispute resolution officer mediating between us because the male landlord was going into a rage. The smear campaign started. They were saying all sorts of slanderous things such as I'm a liar, a crook, a criminal and that I am abusive towards my sister.  I was able to remain professional in light of the smear campaign as I was expecting them to conduct themselves the way that they did. I know this because I understand my landlords behavior in context of narcissism. I did not give a emotional response to their smear campagin against me in the hearing room, or in the mediation. I believe this enraged him even more. \n\nand in the end I was able to get what I wanted, a mediated agreement for no contact, amoung other things. The best thing that you can do with a narcrissist is to have a court order for no contact.  If they contact me, they will be violating a mediated consent order, and i can bring them back to a hearing. \n\nThere seems to be a creepy obsession that the landlords have with my sister. I'm guessing that the obession is due to the fact that they can get narcissist supply from her, and that they cant get any from me. I understand the psycology behind their conduct, and understand what they are trying to do here.\n\nThey have got a lot of supply from her because giving out bad faith eviction notices, would upset her greatly, amoung the other nasty things they did to her. \n\nI also got the board to affirm a termination date and that is even more important, that these toxic landlords are no longer apart of my life and cannot keep this tenancy active. \n\nIf you suspect that your landlords are narcissistic, end your tenancy because it's not worth continuing it.",

        "text": "First time poster in this sub. I'm more active in RBN. Dad is a narc, mom is a victim/trauma-bonded-enabler, sister, mother and myself got to take turns being scapegoats and golden girls just so he could maximize our misery. I now have the entire North American continent and the Atlantic ocean as a nice, comfy, physical barrier between us, and I speak to him only as much as necessary for the sake of my mother's sanity. He isn't part of my life, and I'm emotionally over it.\n\nAs is common with children of Narcs, I dated a string of narcissists and psychologically abusive man-children, and every relationship ended badly. I eventually married a guy with a narcissistic mommy, and to this day I'm unsure if he was a baby narc himself, or just flea-ridden, and it doesn't matter, since he's been out of my life since 2015. Good riddance.\n\nIn 2017 I met my current boyfriend, and he is a nice person with nice parents. Weird, right!? Around the same time, I discovered that narcissism is cluster B disorder, and that it basically explains my entire childhood. I had already completely emotionally detached myself from my father and been VLC/ grey rocking for over a decade before learning about narcissism.\n\nThe more I learn about narcissism, the more I'm seeing fleas all over myself. It's making me really insecure, because I'm scared as hell of losing the one person in my life who is genuinely good, because I, quite frankly, have no damned idea how to be in a relationship isn't based around resenting the other person.\n\nTherapy is a pretty obvious answer, but this nice boy unfortunately lives in the Netherlands, and \"ik spreek maar een klein beetje Nederlands\"  (I speak only a little dutch). Everyone here speaks conversational English very well, but I feel like if I need to speak slowly and reduce what I'm saying to conversational terminology and if the therapist is going to have to do the same, it's probably going to be more frustrating than beneficial. God forbid I actually end up crying and babbling incoherently infront of one. Basically I worry that, unless it's a therapist who has an extremely strong interest in the English language, or simply speaks English as their first language, that language is going to be a barrier. And for extra lolz, we live in the ass end of nowhere, so the likelihood of my finding an English therapist in a town of 3,000, seems pretty much nonexistent.\n\nIf anyone has any books or other literature that might be helpful I'd love to hear it, or maybe just a really good flea shampoo recommendation. I tend to zone out when watching videos or listening to podcasts so those aren't as likely to help me.\n\n---\n\n(As far as my learning dutch goes, again, like many children of narcs, I've got a bunch of fun mental illnesses, the worst of which is depression, for which I was declared disabled back in Canada. The biggest persistent symptom of my depression is cognitive degradation, so it's really really hard for me to learn dutch, despite the fact that I study and have extensive discussions about the intricacies of both English and Dutch and the relations between the two with my bilingual language nerd boyfriend. I'm learning at about the same pace as a new human would. I've been at it for three or four years, and I can communicate about as well as a three or four year old, and that ain't going to cut it in therapy. \"Mijn vader is een narcistische klootzak.  Ja, je vader is een klootzak.\" isn't going to tell me anything I don't already know.)",

I recently met some great ppl that I‚Äôve started talking to and that I‚Äôm very interested in and attracted to, and I was soooo excited at first but now I‚Äôm feeling really really anxious and scared. I feel a little hyper vigilant and guarded, but I also am afraid that I‚Äôm somehow going to mess everything up (because I was blamed for everything) or that maybe the things my abuser said about me were true. I felt a lot of anxiety in that relationship bcuz of the things that were happening (hot n cold, one sided, lying, possible cheating, verbal/emotional abuse, gaslighting, little emotional intimacy, being isolated from friends n family, little empathy) and I thought i wouldn‚Äôt experience it here but it‚Äôs showing up again. My anxiety was weaponized against me by my former partner and I was told I was just overreacting or that there‚Äôs something wrong with me feeling the way I do or that her hurtful behaviour was normal. My trauma was even thrown in my face at the end of the relationship.\n\nSo seeing that same anxiety show up really makes me question myself. Luckily, the anxiety never affected my behaviour and I‚Äôm still very enthusiastic and for the most part present but I want to fully heal and move past the other situation so I can have a healthy long term relationship. Does anyone have any advice or tips for me?",

It‚Äôs a sad fact of life.\n\nIn your man‚Äôs case, I doubt that he‚Äôs predatory. I obviously haven‚Äôt even met him but I‚Äôll bet you that what he‚Äôs done to you wasn‚Äôt premeditated or that he truly understands the repercussions of his actions. I can also predict with a fair degree of accuracy that this story is not yet over. There is a good chance that he will be back and that this pattern will reset and repeat.\n\nIt‚Äôs interesting because I had a long telephone conversation with xxxx the other day. She has a gay friend who she feels is always taking advantage of her. I tried to imagine what a therapist might say to me in such a situation and naturally I ended up turning the thing around. I asked her why she was allowing herself to be treated in this manner.\n\nI could apply that logic to you ‚Äì and myself, for that matter. Why are you and I allowing ourselves to be treated by people in this way? What exactly are we looking for that compels us to leave ourselves so open and susceptible to disappointment? We both share some common features, We have both been betrayed horribly by a long-term partner, we both spend our lives looking after other people rather than ourselves. We are the archetypal people pleasers! What was it in our upbringing that made us become such a personality type? In my case, it is almost certainly my childhood which plays a big part in this situation. And I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the same for you.\n\nWhy do we gravitate toward unsuitable people with whom we somehow find a kind of comfort? In my case I ended up marrying my father. You seem to be establishing a pattern of attracting people who turn out to be not what they appear to be. It‚Äôs such a terrible clich√© and probably not the type of answer that you‚Äôre looking for at this moment, when you‚Äôre at your most miserable and vulnerable. But just as I seem to be the common denominator in all these crazy women that I have ended up giving a part of myself to, I think that there is a good chance that you share my propensities. This may be why we find ourselves drawn to each other a little.\n\nThis is not helping of course. Not that a text message can really help anybody. But I‚Äôm here if you want to talk and vent. Despite appearances, I can be a very good listener. My ear can be quite sympathetic. Take advantage of me or decide that you‚Äôre better off handling your pain on your own. Alternatively, it might be good for you, as I said yesterday, to think about a therapist. It can be a helpful process. A good therapist will get you to ask yourself questions that we become very skilful at avoiding.\n\nSo sorry xxx",

When I like someone and we start dating, I start to wonder if he won't turn out to be the same as my ex, if he won't go crazy after a while. And I automatically distance myself. I am currently dating a 33 year old man who has one child and is separated from his wife. Everything is going great, he's not in a big hurry, we've talked that in a few more months he wants to introduce me to his child, but I'm still scared.  Questions keep ringing in my head.  What if he's a psychopath, what if he's even worse?  I can't trust my intuition, when I systematically overthinking things and creating worst-case scenarios in my head. It's like I'm looking for some guarantee that he'll be normal. \nHow do I get rid of these thoughts?  What should I do so that I don't just sabotage myself?",

        "text": "Last night I found a picture of him and his \"new\" girlfriend in his home country. She's beautiful and looks like a great person (and less experienced like me). It's been four months since he dumped me and only two since he stopped contacting me. For some reason, around midnight I was called to check his profile for the first time in a month and to my shock, she posted a picture of them together and tagged him only 20 minutes prior. Within 10 minutes, the tag was gone, and I know if I had checked any later, I never would have seen that photo and gotten confirmation. I am actually so glad I saw this because I don't feel crazy anymore.\n\nAll of my gut feelings and concerns were real. He looks so much older than he did a few months ago, like he's aged years. Whether he or she removed his tag from the photo I don't know, but if he removed it, it would be the same process of hiding her that he did with me. It's exactly what happened to me he met me only two months from his previous relationship in 2021 (which could have been her for all I know). This clearly isn't a new relationship. He didn't just meet this girl within a week of flying back to his hometown and post a picture confirming their relationship.\n\nEverything he never told me finally feels real now. All the lies are real now. It's such a slap in the face- but yet I also feel relief that I was right. I was never his type- he follows all short brunette latina girls. I had a horrible gut wrenching feeling in September that he dumped me to go have his fun up here before going back home to his country for the winter and I was right. She has a 3-4 yr old child- is it his? She was born in 2002, she‚Äôs not even 21 yet. I am years older than her and so is he. He couldn't stand that I had a singular ex boyfriend from high school in 2018 but now he's in a relationship with a young girl who has a baby daddy. I feel worthless and less than, knowing I never got the REAL him. I wasn't worth it in his eyes, my love was dismissed. I was a rebound, a practice, a year of fun and someone to abuse. He never loved me. I feel so angry that he was able to replace me and move on like it was nothing, and all these months I have spent pining in a trauma bond and crying over someone I never truly knew. This is the second time now I‚Äôve been directly replaced by a girl who is years younger than me. It feels awful. I feel so alone in the world.\n\nHow can people treat others so inhumanely, emotionally, physically and mentally abusive and then go on to live their best life unscathed? I am feeling so alone. I love someone who never existed, a hologram. I am seeing the real him now. I am trying to remind myself that this was going to happen regardless. With all that I have suffered and continue to suffer he has had his next girl(s?) lined up. There can't be any growing or reflecting in a mere few months that leads to permanent change- he told me he was going to find a girl that lets him do what he wants in control and asks for less time. Will she get the best version of him? Will he treat her better? Will karma ever come?",

        "text": "I don't really know where to begin, I just have nobody to talk to\n\nMy boyfriend and I met on discord through mutual friends, a year after my ex and I had broken up, in 2020. We got close and began dating\n\nHe's a really rich guy (multimillionaire), from a rich family, who ran his own business. I am a medical student. From a few months in, he continued to declare how I'm an NPC for choosing such a \"government job\" and I am too pretty to be doing such a thing, and how I should be more like him. Nobody else had ever had an issue with me wanting to be a doctor\n\nAnother major issue we had was my background. I am Arab, but born in the UK, with 2 wonderful parents who are nothing but sweet, but a bit protective. I am also a Catholic (not converted, just this way, we exist!). He would often make remarks about how I must not be Catholic because of where I am from, and how I must have converted (despite seeing my numerous pictures of catholic figures in my home, and even COMPLAINING about how I go to church too much, when I only attend for catholic religious occasions). He also would complain about the language, how saying Inshallah etc. must mean I am lying to him about my religion because catholics do not say that (despite me telling him multiple times that it is just the translation of \"hopefully\" in arabic). This constant complaining led to me muting myself on the calls with him when I would speak to my parents, for him to not hear. In turn, he would call me insecure, and keep insisting that I am doing so because I am insecure about where I am from, and because I am having a \"woman moment\" (another red flag). These issues about my background continued, with him at one point calling me a \"dirty arab\", shortly after telling him I would like my children to learn the language in the future too, despite him saying he doesn't mind that previously. I had blocked him at that point, but his friend messaged me begging me to unblock him because he is very sorry and it would not happen again. So I did.\n\nHe had always shown his racism from the start, and that should have been a red flag. He was half Greek and half Trinidadian, and I had not once complained about his race. He on the other hand would go around using the N word, and other slurs against people from other places (bangladesh, India, Pakistan etc.) My family is the complete opposite and that is not how I was brought up. He stopped using those terms shortly after I told him it was wrong, and he claimed that he has changed and has become better because of me and is trying.\n\nAside from that, when we would meet, he would be nice, like a gentleman. He would always carry my bag, put food on my plate for me to feed me, and pay everytime, no matter how expensive the bill was. I know that he could easily afford it, but I still felt bad. However, he would almost always complain about what I wore, or how my hair looked, and asked me to look a certain way for him. He would look at other girls telling me \"look how hot she looks, look how nice her hair is, can you do that next time?\" But he would get annoyed if I would look at another guy and say the same thing, saying \"Guys aren't meant to look nice, no guy can look hot, guys don't look hot, they all look the same, it is the girl's job to always look nice.\" He would show up wearing a pair of tracksuit bottoms (his pjs that he would sleep in at night), with no perfume or cologne, claiming that (sorry for this these are his words) \"only bengali guys wear perfume\" (which is simply not true). This carried on for a while until I showcased an extreme disgust at his lack of hygeine, and he improved by starting to wear suits, and buying a perfume (a month before I am writing this post).\n\nHe would constantly show up late to our dates. The first time he wanted me to meet his parents I had just finished hospital placement, and I was dressed in very work clothes, with no makeup and my hair undone. He told me his parents really wanted to see me so I should come and see them. Despite me clearly showcasing I didn't want to, I agreed as his mum was on the phone. He told me to meet him at a restaurant close to his home, in an area that I have never been in and I am not familiar with, and that he is 15 minutes away. I arrive there, call him and he says he is still 15 minutes away and there is just some traffic, so I should sit in the restaurant, order some drinks, and the waitors know him and that he is coming and I am his gf, so they will look after me. I wait for 30 mins, send him messages, and he lies and says he is 5 mins away and that I should continue waiting as his family really want to see me. Time passes, and I keep messaging, he ignores some messages, makes up a fake lie time for the others, so I just keep waiting. I waited 2 hours for him to come. This carried on happening. He would lie, say he had left the house, he is only 15/20 mins away, he is coming, he just has his business to sort out and clients and he'd be there. If I would be at the place waiting for him, and continue messaging him asking where he is, he would get annoyed and tell me he is coming, and he is very busy but freed up time to see me so I should respect that, and if I message asking where he is again, he would turn around and go home. So I would on average wait 45 mins to an hour for him to come everytime, often sat alone in a restaurant. When I would tell him waitors are coming and how much longer he will be as theyre busy and need to free up the table for new customers, he gets angry and asks me to show him the waitor that said that so that he could either \"beat him up/punch him/choke him until he is blue in the face.\" He would also often leave mid way through our lunches/dinners for 30 mins at a time to see clients so that he can make his 10s of thousands of money from them. The only time he showed up earlier than me was the most recent date we went on, because he could tell I was nearing ending the relationship.\n\nHe was very protective. He would always see when I was online on whatsapp and stay there for a while, then message me claiming I am cheating on him, and asking me who I am messaging or demanding to see a screenshot of my chat log. He would not let me talk to any other guys, even if it is only regarding work, and would see it as flirting if another guy messaged me or I messaged him. He, on the other hand, would be allowed to message other women for business. When we would go out, he would give me his phone, telling me I can go through it all to see who he is messaging. I have to admit, he would never message any girl for anything other than business, and only has 2 guy friends. But when he would ask to see my phone, I would get so angry and upset. I know he has given me his to look through, but I didnt ask, nor did I want to see his phone. He would go through mine and get angry if a guy even asked me a simple question like \"what time do we need to go to hospital placement tomorrow?\". This led me to not wanting me to give him my phone anymore, so him getting suspicious and claiming that I must be cheating on him. Since then, he has said he doesn't want to see my phone, but he knows something must be going on because I am so \"secretive\" so I must be messaging other guys. He kept stating how it's okay, and how he's fine with me and my \"flirting with other guys\", and that he \\*knows\\* my parents are going to end up marrying me to a doctor boyfriend anyway. I have expressed to him multiple times very clearly that my parents will never give me an arranged marriage and nobody in my family has ever gotten married in that way. He says \"whatever\" and acts like I'm lying.\n\nI had only ever had 1 relationship before him, that lasted 2 years between my ages of 16 to 18, where it ended with the boyfriend cheating on me. Since that, I had only spoken to 2 guys, both of which ended within 2 weeks for one, and a month for the other. We didn't so much as share a kiss. Yet he would say I had been in 3 relationships before him and he was my 4th. He would make me seem like a slut for dating \"so many guys\", even though I was still even a virgin (nothing wrong even if I wasn't one), and that I was lucky to finally end up with a good gentleman like him who was brought up right. He would get angry and often think about what I had done with my first boyfriend, and get upset and annoyed at me, even though it had been several years since then and had not spoken to him. He, on the other hand, had slept with 2 girls before me, but claimed that it was okay, because guys are meant to do that, and he was never in a relationship with them or had feelings for them. He was very respectful and understanding though when he saw I was not ready to have my first time, and despite being ready, he immediately stopped when he saw I was scared and he hugged me and cared for me. Throughout the 2 years he never pushed me to sleep with him even though he clearly wanted it, and for that I am grateful.\n\nHe has two extremes. He can act very soft, being nice to his mother calling her \"mummy\" and cuddling with her, and then screaming at her, even while on call with me, saying she's a terrible driver, or she's \"such a fucking woman\" and \"you're going to crash the fucking car again are you okay?\" etc. He seemed extremely misogynistic, often blaming me when I would get angry at him, saying that I was just having a \"woman moment\" or that it must be near my period, or that I am insecure for getting upset about something, and I shouldn't be insecure about it (when it wasn't that). He would say I'm a feminist and a social justice warrior, or \"part of the LGBT\" if I complain about the way he is speaking to me or other women. He would call my friend (who has one eye which is cross eyed due to an issue at birth), the \"disgusting one eyed monster\", and when I would say it's wrong, he would say \"what it's true\"\n\nHe has since stopped saying all that, and has tried to reduce those previous faults up there, and says he is making progress and becoming a better person because of me. However, the thing that threw me over the edge was something that happened a week ago, which seems so little and stupid and insignificant. I was watching with my mum downstairs and told him I would call him after I was done. He replied \"fine forget about me\" and \"what are you watching, al-jazeera?\" (an Arabic news channel). This just threw me over. I got angry at him, called him fucking racist, and stopped talking to him. He said that it was a \"genuine mistake\" and I was overreacting and I didn't need to be so insecure about it and it's fine if I'm watching that, when he knows I wasn't.\n\nI stopped talking to him, sending only brief replies for a couple of days, then ignoring him for a full day. He could see I was reading his messages. That night he began sending me long paragraphs and messages, trying to guilt trip me, and gaslight me into thinking I'm overreacting, and I will speak to him again, as there have been times where I have blocked him in the past but unblocked him and come back to him. He said I am incapable of making decisions for myself and will always come back to him, and he has been nothing but a gentleman to me, and I have had much worse exes so he is great in comparison and I need him. He says that he is a good guy, as my ex cheated on me, and any other guy would have done the same these days, to a girl who doesn't sleep with him for 2 years, but he is different and a good guy so he would never think of that. He said that I was heartless and had a rotten heart for ignoring him despite being in a relationship for 2 years, and it is clear I am not wife material. I then told him I wanted to block him on everywhere and he said sure. When it was clear I was serious and I had blocked him everywhere, he messaged me on a game chat that we used to play, begging me not to block him, saying it was a genuine mistake, and I shouldn't block him all because of the \"al-jazeera thing\". When I mentioned all the other stuff he had done, he said that those were all in the past, and the last time I saw him he wasn't late, didn't leave in the middle of the date, and was dressed well and smelled nice. He also said how he hasn't been racist for a while and how he hasn't said the N word or anything similar for ages. He said that I can see that he had changed and I shouldn't throw away and waste those 2 years we had together. I told him he himself said he didn't think I was wife material but he said that that has nothing to do with this breakup and is coming all from me. He begged and begged me not to block him, saying we don't need to date, we can just talk, he wants to just talk to me to see if I am good. When I said he can't call me everyday anymore, he got angry and upset, saying we dated for 2 years and he can't even call me anymore. He said \"give me a month where we don't speak and I'll show you I've changed, I will be good, you saw I changed last time, please don't leave me\", but it was clear that he wanted me to remain his girlfriend and thought I would go back to him. He said that we had both done bad things, and we both are bad, and when I said that that means the relationship is toxic if we are both bad, he said that everyone makes mistakes and nobody is perfect. No matter how clear I would make it that I didn't want him anymore and we had broken up, and for him to stop contacting me, he would say \"I know, and stop rubbing it in my face that we are not together, it's hurting me\", but he would continue to call me baby and not understand. So i just had to say sorry and I blocked him.\n\nI feel extremely alone, and guilty for blocking him, we spoke every day, and I know deep in my heart the \"al-jazeera\" incident isn't the only thing that made me leave him, even though it was the final thing that happened. He said I was behaving like my ex (because my ex blocked me on everything after he left me when cheating), and that I am hurting him. I feel so bad for giving him no way to contact me, and I keep imagining that he is feeling so sad right now, and waiting every second or hoping that I would unblock him (I had done so before, but I made it very clear I would not unblock this time). He had begged me a million times not to block him, said sorry a million times, yet I still did. I feel so sad, I have cried, I feel empty, but most of all I feel guilty because I feel like I am making him hurt so much now. I'm not asking for advice, I just need somebody to talk to. I can't talk to my parents as they did not know about this relationship, but even if I were to tell them, I know they would not get angry at me, but they will feel sorry for the hurt I had experienced and what he had put me through. I just needed to get all my feelings out. I've been too ashamed to even tell one of my closest friends that I was in this relationship because despite having good parts, it just felt so toxic.\n\nI just need someone to read it, I just need to vent, I am feeling really really upset right now, just empty and guilty\n\nTLDR: I blocked my ex on everything for being racist, too protective, and not liking my way of life. I feel really guilty as he begged me not to block him, and despite me wanting to end things on a friendly good note, it was clear he thought that we will get back together eventually, so things did not end well. I just needed someone to read this and to let everything out.\n\nThank you all for reading this very long post, I don't know what I want to hear, but I appreciate it, I am just very hurt",

        "text": "I'm 4 months post breakup, 3 months in a necessary state of infrequent, structured contact with my NEX regarding payment and crediting for a project we shared while together. I'm practicing self care, taking care of the things I need to, strategizing in how to move forward with healing and taking concrete steps to do so. I have a good support network and people are here for me. I have a wonderful place to be, good work prospects for my industry, systems of validation and an excellent therapist.\n\nEven with all of these things in place, my mind constantly obsesses with cyclic thought patterns of wondering what she's doing, who she's seeing, her general status. I think this comes from looking for some sign of universal retribution for her cruelty. To be clear, I'm not advocating for this. I have no active component in what her life becomes, nor do I wish to. This cycle, of course, brings pain in continuing to remember her behavior during and in the aftermath of our relationship, that she has no morality or remorse, and that she is an abuser to whom I gave far too much. We all know this pain.\n\nThis all leads to the desire to send a message of confrontation. One that basically lets her know that I see her for the abhorrent person she is, that she'll reap what she has sown, and that when she does I'll be glad to know it. \n\nI, of course, will NOT send this message. Nor do I encourage or support any person reading this to engage in any kind of vengeful behavior.\n\nI will not send this message partially because confrontation would threaten my accreditation for the work I did on the project we shared. But mostly because I know that re-engaging would make things a whole lot worse for my healing process. She just wouldn't hear the message, would perceive my message a threat and retaliate. It would bring me nothing but pain.\n\nI know this consciously, but I can't let go of the obsession. How do I get my emotional state to follow my conscious mind? How tf do I let go of the need for justice beyond doing what I'm already doing? Knowing that I can't and won't confront her, how do I let go and accept what I suffered without the need for punishment?\n\nYo mods: I'm not sure if this post abides totally by sub rules, I'm happy to make necessary alterations. I'm here to respect the community. Thanks!",

        "text": "I only realized now that the person I was seeing might be a narcissist (or have narcissistic tendencies). I met this guy (now 28m, then 22m) when I was 18f (now 24f). We would see each other a few times a year to hook up but nothing beyond that. During the pandemic we had limited contact. We reconnected last year, I had been celibate and hadn't slept with anyone for 2 years (in fact, he was the last guy I slept with). I had a lot of trust issues because my ex did something really terrible to me, and he assured he wouldn't hurt me and wanted to be with me. He'd talk about things moving quickly between us - getting married and having a lot of kids. I am religious and he said he was as well, despite being a bit of a drug and sex addict. I had noticed a lot of changes in him between when we had last seen each other to now. He was more interested in commitment with me than before (though we didn't get to that point given he had been traveling a lot) possibly because his friends are all getting married. He is very wealthy and high status... I am not so wealthy but am well-educated and in a prestigious field. We are both conventionally attractive. In any case, he was very pushy and wanted to have sex very quickly, and though I gave in because I had always really cared about him, it was a bit uncomfortable for me and that upset him. He wanted me to be excited to sleep with him and he felt when I wasn't it was a reflection of me not being into him. He also had promised he wasn't seeing anyone else, which I thought was a bit questionable. Our time together in person would always be great, he was very sweet and attentive, but he was not very communicative and could be sort of flakey.  He said that he was just a busy person, but I always would become afraid he was ghosting me so I'd get really upset and asked if he could be more communicative. This was especially because he was suggesting commitment but it wasn't getting there, so it made me feel uncomfortable. I went so far as to suggest we stop being physical because I didn't feel cared about. Any time I expressed my needs, however, he would flip the script and explain why I'm the bad person and unappreciative. I acknowledge I could be a bit much at times, but his lack of communication really made me crazy. After our arguments, I'd always get the silent treatment and have to beg him to come back. Most recently, and what made me think he might be a narc, is he was on vacation and before he left, said he was excited to see me and that he loved me. However, when he came back and I started sending a ton of messages to him he just kind of got fed up. He said we should take things slower (aka just have sex). He said he wasn't sure he loved me anymore, that I'm clingy/needy and he had hoped I'd get the message by him ignoring me because it makes him want to run in the opposite direction \\[he does, however, find me very attractive\\]. He also called me a naive child and that I should learn something from this and that I need to grow up. While at first he said it'd be best if we went our separate ways, he then said he just wanted me to chill. It was kind of a bad argument and the following day I very honestly laid out my feelings for him (telling him I loved him and that I will do anything to make this work, including not having emotional outbursts). I received no response. However, he is not very responsive in general so I wasn't sure if this was one of our usual arguments or if this was permanent. I was planning to not reach out anymore (I usually text him every day) but after two days of not texting him and trying to respect his space, I reached out today with a very rational text expressing an apology, my desire to make things work, and that I would respect if it was really over. So far an hour has passed and he hasn't responded. I'm unfortunately very trauma bonded to this individual, in college I was very depressed and he helped me through my problems a lot, and because he is tall, handsome and charming, and allegedly wanting the same future I want, I'm afraid I won't find anyone like him again. During our argument, I had alluded to him being similar to a narcissistic character in a book we had both read, and he thoroughly denied this, stating he was a good person. What throws me off as well is that he has a therapist and is kind to me in person. He doesn't insult me but mostly just doesn't care about my needs and isn't communicative, and finds it very insulting when I call him out. I somehow stumbled upon this page when reading about the silent treatment, but I'm afraid I might be permanently discarded (I still love him since it's so fresh sadly).",

My freelance checks don‚Äôt always come on time. \n\nThe reason I‚Äôm not working full-time is because I‚Äôm studying for my A Levels on my own, which will allow me to graduate high school and go on to university next year.

Since running away almost a year ago, my relationship with my eMom has improved significantly and I spend a lot of time sleeping over at her house. Still, she is unable to respect my boundaries in many ways and refuses to acknowledge that my nDad abused me. She says I ran away from home ‚Äúto drink and throw my life away‚Äù. Though we get along better, we still fight a lot and I don‚Äôt know if I can bear this permanently again. I don‚Äôt know if I can lose my freedom and dignity just to be able to save money.

I‚Äôm struggling a lot financially and wonder if I should just go back home and save up then leave after my exams.",

        "text": "CW: Mentions of past child abuse (NOTHING GRAPHIC). TLDR at the bottom.\n\nSo 6 years &amp; 2 months ago, my mother walked out on us. She started a separation/divorce that didn't start proper till almost 3 years ago now (in 2020). Within a month of her leaving, she and her side of the family tried to stomp boundaries despite us repeatedly rejecting contact with them, trying to use the Christmas excuse. We told her not to call us but she did as she pleased, we just didn't answer. \n\nWithin 6 months, I had a huge panic attack in the mall when I was with my dad and brother. Dad was being very callous towards me until I started to admit to my mother abusing me and my brother when he was at work. He realized why I wanted to leave the mall so fast after we encountered her and quickly apologized for being so harsh on me during my panic attack and told me to do what I needed to calm down then to write out what she had done. When I finished, I had an 8 page document. \n\nWe went to the cops 2 or 3 weeks later to report it. The statute of limitations meant we couldn't have get charged, BUT, they did investigate and it would stay on her record for 8-10 years. Basically, the statute of limitations is the only thing keeping her from being arrested or charged from what I was told. \n\nAfter that I notified the family, stating that my mother had abused me as a child and how I was seeking therapy for it. I also explained that that's why me and my brother were NC with her. They immediately claimed dad was \"putting [us, me and bro] up to it\" and claimed they knew our mother didn't abuse us or do some if the acts she did. \n\nIn 2018, my mother's family kept messaging me, wanting me to connect with them but I ignored them. The year previous on my birthday, my mother called me 13 times within an hour before we unhooked the phone. In 2018, she called 5 times in 3 days, between my brother's and father's birthdays. It upset our family and I went to the cops who went to my grandmother's house (where my mother's living) and warned her to stop calling us else she'd be charged with harassment, and if it was over \"divorce issues\" (exact quote from my mother and the cop), to get a lawyer. Everyone was blocked on Facebook too to end it.\n\nIn February 2020, I spoke to my uncle... Let's call him Jay (fake name). I explained what was going on because he married into the family, and him and his wife -my aunt Amy let's call her- always were more neutral on matters and liked to see both sides before making an opinion. My uncle was shocked, but approved of dad telling us that he'd let me and my brother decide if we wanted a relationship with our mother as he (dad) had no say. My aunt then invited herself to the conversation and let a few things slip. \n\n1. They thought dad called the cops on my mother over the phonecalls, and we're SHOCKED that it was me and that I'd do it to anyone because I was SICK of the boundary stomping. \n\n2. My mother tried to access my brother's medical records after the last seizure she knew he had. We're not sure if she got that info or not as the doctor knew of the separation and my brother DID NOT live with her nor did we have any contact with her. \n\n3. My mother supposedly \"admitted to some of the abuse\", again exact quote from my aunt. She expressed no remorse, admitted she knew she did wrong, and admitted to many of the very specific acts I mentioned to family. Other acts she said she \"don't quite remember it that way\". The family was shocked that they had defended her for 4 years at that point but didn't know how to deal so they just.... Didn't. \n\nThis is a family that's ALL ABOUT KIDS. If anyone wrongs a kid, they're lower than scum. But she's fAmIlY so she gets off without anything, or the family \"doesn't want to get involved in the drama\". \n\nStop me if you've heard this before. \n\nSo after the meeting and seeing my grandmother and mother drive by as I was leaving (either it was coincidence as it was my mother's birthday, OR my aunt texted them) I cut ties with the family, even after my pre-cancer diagnosis. I started to wonder if my aunt told me that just to get me to drop the abuse talk, just to mess with my head/ see how I'd take it, or if she's being genuine. I really don't know anymore.\n\nMy mother sent the divorce papers later that month and days later, my brother had two seizures in one night, that my dad blames on himself for stressing him out.\n\nSince then, we haven't had any contact. I've seen and avoided my mother in stores if I spot her (still getting over my fear of her). We've seen some family members, some gave taunted dad by making comments he could hear in hopes he'd take the bait, but nothing huge. \n\nUntil last Friday. \n\nIn 2020 I mentioned to my Aunt and Uncle that I got a new job and where I worked. Well last week my other uncle, Uncle Ted (my mother's youngest brother) came in. I almost didn't recognize him and I greeted him and was very friendly. He didn't realize it was me until I lowered my mask. \n\nWhile his two companions shopped we spoke... Well Kore like I let him talk. He just moved home last month, mentioned a work site out in BC that he was looking to apply to (I kept it in mind for dad who's looking to change jobs)and stuff like that. He didn't ask about the family and didn't ask about what I was up to or anything. \n\nI let him talk and that was fine. Just nodded my head, said \"yup\" and \"alright\" and answered shopping related questions. That was it. \n\nI mentioned it to dad when I got home and he thought I was nuts for even engaging. Said I should have just pretended like I didn't know him and just kept things professional. Said I was letting them know I was willing to let them back in. That they had a chance to try to win me back over. \n\nI'm still debating on if I messed up or not, as he and his wife (and his son, my cousin) were my favorite relatives growing up. He Hever responded when I reached out to him and his wife is one of the ones who taunted dad in public.\n\nSo did I fuck up or was my reaction natural and something I need to suppress in the future?\n\nTLDR; mother abused me and my brother when growing up and after she split with dad, her family sided with get against us and called me a liar until mom eventually admitted to some of it. Her family still sees he as doing no wrong and supports get while trying to boundary stomp. I cut them out of my life but saw an uncle last week and let him talk for a bit (I greyrocked him). Told dad and he thinks I should have pretended to not know him and should have only responded to retail related questions. Is he right or was my reaction expected as someone who's in recovery?\n\nSorry this is so long.",

        "text": "I'm a photographer and I met this person at a festival. She was performing. I took a bunch of photos and showed it to her afterwards. She liked them a lot so I decided to send them to her a few months later.  \nFast forward to a photoshoot we have. It went well. It was fun and my first time getting to speak to her while not performing. At this point I have no inclination that anything is wrong.   \nFast forward again. I see she has a performance 2 hours from me. I decided to go and surprise her. She's visibly thrilled I'm there. Hardly anyone is there watching her perform since it's a small venue so I was like her only saving grace. After she was done we took more video and photos then had dinner at the next door restaurant. This is why my red flags start going off.  \nIt's been a nice dinner so far and then I try to find out what places she likes to spend time at. Perhaps this is my way I could ask her out. I ask her about museums and she instantly deflects by saying something like \"I went to one years ago when my parents took me.\" Then she proceeded to talk about her parents' interests. I tried one more time with another location, same deflection. At the end she pays for my dinner and we head out to the car. At this point I realized she also never asked me a single question about myself. So that plus the deflections, I decided to just hug and go home. All together we spent 3 hours together.  \nIt doesn't end there. The next day she made a post about her performance. She mentions a little girl and one of her mentors and how he was such an inspiration. Not once am I mentioned. Somehow I didn't exist to her. I'm now on high alert as this is not normal behavior when you're friends with someone.  \nFast forward to an event she invited me to. However, it was at the last possible second when she had at least a week to tell me. Her one stipulation was I could not speak to her or hang out after the show. I decided to go to see what the heck was so special. While I was there, it was below 40 degrees out and a good bit away from my car. She never approaches me during either performance, there were 2 that night, to see if I was ok. I had to walk back to my car to warm up then walk all the way back to see the second show. I went home never speaking to her. Again, no mention of me in any story that I was there to support her.  \nI think we were together 1 or 2 more times after that. Now during this time, there was never anyone else there to support her. No friends or boyfriends came up to her. It was just me.   \nThere were moments when she would message me out of the blue and say how amazing I am and how she was glad to meet me. I'm assuming this was love-bombing or wants to just keep me on the hook for longer. I am a loyal friend and if you are nice to me, I will go to the ends of the earth for you and she probably figured this out or maybe I told her.\n\nFast forward to NYE and she announces she has a boyfriend in the most generic way possible, she says they have all these things in common. Never mentioning anything specific about him. Sounded like a Hallmark card. Like he was the perfect man. She also never included a photo of them together in her FB post which I thought was strange but she included his full name for some reason. Now this is the first time I heard she was seeing anyone, otherwise I never would have pursued her. I was also over her house once. It was a mess. The kitchen looked like a grenade went off. If she was seeing someone who spent all this time with her, I would imagine she would have cleaned up or he would have offered to help.\n\nShe mentioned hiking and I saw photos of her hiking trip to see if he was in any of them. 4 photos of her where it looked like someone was standing about 10 feet away were taking her photo. However, there's no photo of them together in any of them. Just her. I started to realize she may have just bought a tripod up with her and set her phone to a timer.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is, she professed her love for this man yet there is not a shred of evidence even exists or if he does, isn't aware of her and she just pulled his name out of the yellow pages. Now if she was my friend and she did see I was trying to become more than friends, and if she was seeing someone at the time, she should have told me so I could move on and still respect her as a person for being honest with me.\n\nShe also went to a NYE party and dragged a friend along but not her new boyfriend. This time she took a ton of photos with all her friends.\n\nAfter this I started to go back through all her messages and moments with her and realized she may have NPD. I have since stopped talking to her and will not initiate anything. I am tired of having my kindness be used to supply her or anything with attention who gives nothing back. This all took place from October to the end of December this year. \n\nI haven't told my friends yet because I need to be absolutely sure she has NPD so I'm still gathering information but as far as I can tell, it's pretty clear to me when everything is added up.",

        "text": "This is repost from two years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the beginning it was perfect. It was as if all roads in your life had been converging on this point. Every false start that you had endured, every betrayal you had suffered, everything that had ever happened to you in your miserable, unfulfilled life was merely a rehearsal. It was all leading up to this moment.\n\nAnd she was beautiful. Impossibly beautiful. And funny. And kind. And generous. And wise. You wondered what you had ever done to deserve such a rare treasure. You wallowed in her sweet aroma. You basked in her dusky body heat. You worshipped her being. In the bedroom you had never experienced such bliss, such sensory pleasures, such *togetherness*. When you talked it was as if you were one and the same person. She was perfect. And wonder upon wonder she believed that you were perfect too. She told you how handsome you were. How witty. How clever. How *special*. She wanted to find out everything about you and didn‚Äôt seem remotely troubled by your more obvious imperfections. The things that had held you back all your life. The scars that stubbornly refused to heal.\n\nThis was love. You were experiencing LOVE. Real love. True love. Enraptured to be entangled in its silky net. Never in your wildest dreams could you have imagined it would ever feel as good as this. As pure. As selfless. As all-consuming. After all those years of hopelessness your life finally had meaning. This is what you had been building towards from the day that you were dragged screaming from the womb. You *believed*. And, incredibly, she *believed*, too. You were *Love Twins* carried along on the wheels of destiny. The two of you overdosed on joy. Freebased on passion. The bliss was almost palpable. You could touch it. You could smell it. You could taste it.\n\nSo you ditch your long-term partner and she ditches hers. *They never really meant anything*, you tell yourself. Because now you have the REAL THING. You get a place together and the days float by in an opiate haze. Every waking moment, every sleeping moment is spent in her company. You talk. You eat. You laugh. You drink. You make love like never before. You plan. You plot. You scheme. The future is no longer a foreign country. How is it possible that it can feel *this* good to be alive?\n\nAnd then one day when you least expect it you hear the teeniest, weeniest alarm bell gently tinkling away in your blissed-out brain. *What‚Äôs wrong*? you ask. *Is it something I‚Äôve done?* But she just sits there in a grubby dressing gown, her eyes staring blankly ahead. The lips that you long to kiss saying nothing. And suddenly you recoil against the bedroom wall. Such anger! Such rage! How can this girl, this woman, *my Love Twin*, be saying such things? The shock jolts you temporarily back to reality and the breath is squeezed from your lungs. Your world is shattered into pieces and already you would do anything to glue those broken shards back together again.\n\nIn the morning come the apologies. The tears. The explanations. Always the explanations. It‚Äôs *hormones*, she tells you. *It‚Äôs a medical condition*, she will say later. *It‚Äôs this. It‚Äôs that.* So you wrap your arms around her trembling shoulders and tell her not to worry. *We can fix this*, you say. *Together you and I can make this righ*t. And she kisses you and a smile lights up her beautiful face. The snarling, spitting stranger from yesterday now banished forever. Until the next time.\n\nThe days turn into weeks and the weeks turn into months and the months turn into years. The passage of time is immaterial so long as you have your *Love Twin*. A baby arrives. And even though you never really wanted one you pick the little girl up in your arms and you‚Äôre in love all over again. Now there are three of you. Three of you against the world. You pose before the camera lens and smile. You don‚Äôt deserve this. You don‚Äôt deserve such happiness. Nobody does.\n\nAnd then‚Ä¶ And then‚Ä¶ Things begin to change. Slowly. Insidiously. Like the stationary hands of a clock you are unaware of any movement until you chance to look away. You‚Äôre the same person that you always were. At least, you‚Äôre mostly the same person. Sure, you don‚Äôt go out as much as you used to but then you have different priorities nowadays. For one thing there‚Äôs a toddler to look after. To feed. To clean. To entertain. What could be more important than that? And so what if you‚Äôre losing touch with your friends? And for that matter your family, too? But it's only natural, isn‚Äôt it? You keep telling yourself that. (*Why does she do that strange thing? Verbally attacking the people you care about so that these days you're wary of introducing her to anybody? It must be because she loves you so much that she wants to have you all to herself. Yes, that‚Äôs the reason. It‚Äôs charming really. Sweet.*)\n\nAnd then one evening you catch your reflection in the mirror. You look older. Heavier. You‚Äôve put on thirty‚Ä¶ Forty pounds and your belt strains against your flabby belly. You limp a little, too. (*You really must see a doctor about that when you have a moment‚Ä¶)* There are dark circles under your eyes ‚Äì hardly surprising given how hard it is to sleep at night. *Who‚Äôd be a father, huh?!* And yes, you‚Äôre a little down these days. Well a lot down actually. You know that you are. She tells you all the time that you are. She tells you because she cares about you. Because she's your *Love Twin*. But then there‚Äôs so much to worry about. So much work to do. It‚Äôs only natural.\n\nWhen you met your L*ove Twin* you were a writer. You even sold a few books in your time. But that‚Äôs in the past. You‚Äôve put your career temporarily on hold while you attend to more important matters. And yes, you hate the job that necessity forced you to take. You really despise it if you‚Äôre honest with yourself. The thought of doing it sometimes makes you feel physically sick. But you don‚Äôt have a choice because there‚Äôs the baby to look after. *You* have to be there to take her to school. And *you* have to be there to pick her up afterwards. It‚Äôs lucky that *we* found a job with such flexible hours. *We‚Äôd* have been in real trouble if *we* hadn‚Äôt been able to do this.\n\nAnd every evening you wait for her to come home. She doesn‚Äôt like to cook so it‚Äôs best that you do it. And even if your meagre efforts are often rewarded with a grimace it‚Äôs not really important. You smile at her as she floats in through the door. She pecks you on the cheek and frowns. She doesn‚Äôt notice the aftershave that you‚Äôve doused yourself in especially for her. She‚Äôs oblivious to the softness of your chin. (Naturally, you love her so much that it‚Äôs become your habit to ensure that you‚Äôre freshly shaved and showered for that special moment when returns from a hard day's work.)\n\nTo grudging appreciation you serve the food that you‚Äôve prepared. You swallow it down whole and it sticks in your teeth. You stack the dishwasher and put the baby to bed. Except that she‚Äôs no longer a baby. She‚Äôs growing up fast. Full of questions. Too many questions. *I simply don‚Äôt have enough energy left to reply‚Ä¶* *No more questions. Please. No more demands*. You hear the pulse of your heart as you fight to keep your eyes open. So you read to the little girl until she begins to fall asleep. And you‚Äôre falling asleep too. You‚Äôre falling asleep all the time.\n\nWithout ever noticing it a stranger has moved into your house. But you don‚Äôt know she‚Äôs a stranger. She stares at that chunk of metal and glass in her hand. Endlessly‚Ä¶ Endlessly‚Ä¶ Endlessly‚Ä¶ Tapping away like a metronome. Gently smiling at nobody. Immersed in secret thoughts.\n\nBut she never seems to hear your thoughts. And if she does hear you she won‚Äôt let you speak. *If only she‚Äôd stop interrupting me,* you cry, *I could tell her what‚Äôs really on my mind*. But then‚Ä¶ But then‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve forgotten what it was you wanted to say. Perhaps it‚Äôs just as well. It couldn‚Äôt have been that important anyway. Your *Love Twin* works very hard. It‚Äôs perfectly understandable if she sometimes gets frustrated and hits out at you. And even if some of the things she calls you are nasty ‚Äì well unforgivably nasty, in fact, the sort of things that no person should ever say to another ‚Äì it‚Äôs best that you keep the peace. You can‚Äôt really blame your *Love Twin* for telling it like it is. After all, you know that you‚Äôre too sensitive‚Ä¶ That you overreact‚Ä¶ That your depression is bound to cloud your judgement‚Ä¶ That you overthink things‚Ä¶ That you‚Äôre damaged‚Ä¶ You know this because she tells you so. Not to hurt or criticise, you understand. But because she loves you.\n\nYou know that she loves you because sometimes there still are those moments of bliss. Less frequently, of course. Not so often as they used to be. (B*ringing up a child isn‚Äôt easy, you know!*) Well actually it‚Äôs gotten to the point in which you‚Äôve given up trying. She tells you to calm down. To get a grip. To get over it. That it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault that you both have different sex drives. Naturally she has a point. Sometimes you try to tell her how unhappy this makes you feel. But it‚Äôs not really that big a deal. Because every now and again ‚Äì once or twice a month if you're counting ‚Äì you will feel her creamy flesh against yours. She will extend her arms towards you and for a brief few moments everything is as it should be. You inhale the love. You suck it in. A desperate unspeakable kind of love. How lucky you are to have found your soulmate. *You‚Äôre the love of my life*, she will gently whisper into your ear. She tells you this all the time and you know that it is true.\n\nHow is it possible that your daughter is starting senior school today? Why, it only seems like yesterday that you watched her mother squeeze that frail little body out from between her thighs and into the light. Do the years really pass so quickly? *You‚Äôve lost your mojo. You‚Äôre not the man you used to be*, has become her mantra. *You used to be so wild‚Ä¶ Lippy‚Ä¶ Uncontrollable‚Ä¶ A real rebel‚Ä¶ Perhaps you should see a doctor? Maybe therapy would be good for you?*\n\nAnd she‚Äôs right. Of course she‚Äôs right. You can feel it in your crumbling bones. You can see it in your your blood-shot eyes. How did you become such a disappointment? How could you let your *Love Twin* down like this? Surely she deserves better? She‚Äôs an important woman now. You can‚Äôt believe how much money she earns from that job of hers. Well, career is the more accurate way of describing it. *(Remember when you had a career?)* You‚Äôre so proud of her. So proud that she gets to travel around the world: to New York‚Ä¶ Milan‚Ä¶ Paris‚Ä¶ Berlin‚Ä¶ You tell her that her achievement is your achievement. That staying home to babysit your daughter on those dark winter nights is small fry compared to the pressure, the responsibility that she has to bear on a daily basis. You‚Äôre so proud of her. So proud‚Ä¶\n\nBut even as you have changed over the years, so has she. She‚Äôs 44 now but looks ten years younger. Everybody says so. You‚Äôre 53 but look ten years older. Nobody ever mentions this. They don‚Äôt have to. *There‚Äôs no getting away from the fact that you‚Äôre an older man with no power*, she routinely tells you one afternoon. *Whereas I look better than I‚Äôve ever done.*\n\nAnd who can disagree? She does look better. More beautiful than she ever did. And clearly it‚Äôs no accident. You have to admire her for the number of hours she puts in at the gym. You hate the gym yourself. You don‚Äôt know how she does it. Certainly all her new young friends seem to agree with her. They love her. They worship her. And who can blame them? *It‚Äôs such a breath of fresh air*, you try to reassure yourself, *that she basks in the glow of these bright young flames. Much better than worn out old farts like me*. It‚Äôs incredible really. You don‚Äôt know where she gets the energy from. Three‚Ä¶ Four‚Ä¶ Sometimes five nights a week she‚Äôs out there putting in a full shift with those youngsters. Clubs‚Ä¶ Gigs‚Ä¶ Festivals‚Ä¶ Fancy restaurants‚Ä¶ *Well, with a job like hers she‚Äôs entitled to let her hair down from from time to time. We all are.*\n\nBut where exactly did these people come from? These flawless, unblemished, unwrinkled young friends of hers? You can‚Äôt really be sure. They just seemed to appear one day, to materialise out of thin air: a couple of new faces here and there and then more and more and more. Names mentioned in passing and then in every other breath. And they carry with them new experiences‚Ä¶ Alternative attitudes‚Ä¶ The foreign language of a different generation‚Ä¶ New music‚Ä¶ Indecipherable sounds that make no sense to you but your *Love Twin* somehow seems to effortlessly assimilate. She doesn‚Äôt even listen to any of *our* music any more. But then come to think of it she never *really* did listen to it. How could you not notice?\n\nSometimes she even lets you tag along for the ride and you pretend to enjoy yourself as you‚Äôre dragged around a flickering dance floor inhabited by people twenty years your junior. Amused to see you. Embarrassed to be seen with you. *I don‚Äôt really want to be doing this,* you meekly whisper under your breath, *but I love her and she‚Äôs probably having some kind of mid-life crisis. Yes, that‚Äôs it ‚Äì a mid-life crisis. It‚Äôs those pesky hormones again. Those irritating chemicals that are to blame for those infamous temper tantrums of hers. She needs my support so that one day she‚Äôll come back to me and I‚Äôll have her all to myself again. After all, I‚Äôm her husband and best friend. It‚Äôs my duty. It‚Äôs the least I can do.*\n\nBut yes, it can hurt. Deep down it can really hurt. You never mention it but you hate how she dresses these days. Skin tight jeans‚Ä¶ Plunging necklines‚Ä¶ So much bare flesh. So much cleavage. Who exactly is she putting it on display for? Well obviously it‚Äôs for your benefit because you‚Äôre the love of her life. You know this because barely a week goes by without her telling you so. Despite everything you still have that special bond that brought you together. That made you *Love Twins*. She‚Äôs still your soul mate. She never stops telling you that. 17 years is a long time in anybody‚Äôs book. And don‚Äôt forget that you created a daughter *together*. A living, breathing human miracle.\n\nAnd then one day your reality crumbles. It dissolves into a fine dust that floats through the air and clogs up your lungs. Purely by accident *(was it really an accident?)* you discover on *Find My Phone* of all things that your *Love Twin* is not abroad on business as she is supposed to be. She‚Äôs actually still in London. *Why on earth is she still here?* If texts could scream, your desperate pleas would be heard at the far edge of the universe. *Liar!* You exclaim. *How could you do this to us?!*\n\n*Stop making a fool of yourself,* comes her deadpan response. *He‚Äôs just a friend helping me go through a difficult time ‚Äì I‚Äôm trying to sort out our relationship*.\n\n*Give me his name then!* You demand. *I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôll do*, she says. *I can‚Äôt trust you.*\n\nSlowly, imperceptibly slowly, the truth is drip-fed to you over the coming weeks in bite-sized morsels. Hidden away in meandering sentences the lies detach themselves from fact and float to the surface like oil in a puddle of muddy water. *I have feelings for him,* she calmly admits one afternoon as you shrink before her, your voice hoarse from all the shouting. He‚Äôs 31 ‚Äì a whole quarter of a century younger than you ‚Äì Italian, thick of hair, tanned to perfection. His youth an incurable disease. Far better looking than the empty shell of a man that you‚Äôve become. *He‚Äôs a nice guy*, she casually announces. *You should meet him*.\n\nAnd he‚Äôs by no means the first. You discover this as you pick away at her tapestry of deception. There was that young guy at the gym, (*Ahh‚Ä¶ The gym! The penny drops and rolls away into the distance‚Ä¶ The gym!*) *I bet you didn't know that I was sexting him last year at the Xmas dinner table? Sending him naked pictures of myself‚Ä¶ You know, the ones that you took of me because I asked you to‚Ä¶ Remember?*  And even a couple of one-night stands at parties. *No, I can‚Äôt remember their names‚Ä¶ It's not important‚Ä¶* *And a Calvin Klein mode*, she announces, scarcely able to conceal her pride. Her achievement (*Her achievement is your achievement‚Ä¶*). *I‚Äôm pretty hot, you know*, she smirks in a voice you've never heard before.\n\nYou throw her out of the house and she takes an Uber to her Italian toy boy. You intercept the email that she sends to him in transit: *I‚Äôm sorry you had to be involved,* she writes. *My husband‚Äôs gone crazy! I love you xxx*.\n\nAnd you have gone crazy. How could you *not* go crazy? And all her young friends know that you‚Äôre crazy. Her family do, too. They know you‚Äôre crazy because she‚Äôs told them that you‚Äôre crazy. Your *Love Twin* has made it her duty to do so. The love of your life that was never the love of your life has somehow become the victim in all of this.\n\n*You‚Äôre pathetic*! she snarls. *You‚Äôre a sponger! Over the years you‚Äôve bled me dry*! *You‚Äôre a loser! Get a life/job!* Every day the insults smack you in the pit of your stomach. *You‚Äôre a fat c\\*\\*t! You‚Äôre vile! The gravy train is over! You need help! Even your daughter doesn‚Äôt want or need you! I hate you! Stop abusing me!*\n\nYou lose all understanding. Your world collapses around you. You don‚Äôt know where all these words are coming from. You no longer recognise the person saying them. You cry. You rage. You plead. You whimper. Your *Love Twin* has gone. Somebody else has her now and an imposter has taken her place. In a long-neglected alcove of your mind a memory flickers away in the half-light. And you find yourself thinking back to that morning all those years ago. And that alarm bell tinkling gently away in your loved-up brain.\n\nNaturally you let her back into the house. There was never really any doubt that you would not. A couple of days later you greet her at the front door. You and your hangover. Your only companion. Your new best friend. You tearfully tell her you‚Äôre prepared to forgive. *Have you no self-respect?* comes her retort. So cold. So icy. You explain that you‚Äôre willing to go into therapy with her. To try to work out why she‚Äôs behaving like this. Both of you know that this isn‚Äôt really her. Something has happened to mess up her head. 17 years together cannot be thrown away in the blink of an eye. *On one condition*, she frostily intones, *that I can carry on seeing him at the same time‚Ä¶*\n\nAnd then one day it all becomes too much for you. The pressure crushes your spine. Your shoulders are blocks of ice. Nothing you can force into your body can nullify the pain. You pack a couple of bags: Underwear. Socks. In only a couple of months you‚Äôve lost that thirty or forty pounds that you‚Äôd piled on over the years. You look older than ever. And even the pills cannot bring the blessed relief of sleep. You say goodbye to your daughter, almost an adult now. You cling to each other and she tries to hold back the tears. And then you bid a last farewell to your *Love Twin*.\n\n*How could you do this to me?* you plead.\n\n*It was bigger than me*, she shrugs.\n\n*But how could you tell so many lies?*\n\n*I lie because I can*.\n\nAnd then she wraps her arms around you and you feel her tears trickle slowly down your neck. *You‚Äôre the love of my life*, she whispers in your ear as you close the door behind you and head off into nowhere. Nothing to show for 17 years of commitment. Of love. Your thoughts flow like treacle. The pain of the loss, the agony of the betrayal overwhelms you like a rusty dagger has been plunged into the epicentre of your soul. *How will I ever recover from this?* you scream into the white-hot sunshine. *It‚Äôs just not possible.* *How will I ever live again?*\n\nBut life goes on for some people. Of course it does. Barely 24 hours after bidding that final tearful farewell to *the love of her life,* her life partner for the best part of two decades, the father of her child, your *Love Twin* is parading her shiny new toy before her parents and your dumbstruck daughter. His skin is taut and unwrinkled; his smile is sweetly earnest with unplucked innocence.\n\nHe‚Äôs in love. You know this because your *Love Twin* told you that he is (*Although I‚Äôm not in love with him ‚Äì I‚Äôm not in love with anybody actually‚Ä¶).* If there was any pity left in your heart you would hand it to him freely and without hesitation.",

I was getting my laptop fixed when the technician said it'll take him about an hour and I decided to go to a nearby coffee shop.\n\nI was at the counter when I heard a familiar voice. I looked around to see an old colleague from about 10 years ago. We had interned together but we hadn't worked in the same department, so I barely knew her.\n\nI asked her if she was who I thought she was and she recognized me. I ordered my coffee and cookies and invited her to join me. She said she was waiting for someone so she was happy to talk to me until her friend (another girl) turned up.\n\nWe got our orders and we sat down at the table. She ordered something I'd never had and I asked her about it. She offered me a piece to try, except she actually fed me. It felt a bit odd because my nex used to control what I eat and it felt nice to have someone actually give me food.\n\nShe was very touchy-feely, very quick. Not in a creepy way, but in a way you'd be comfortable with someone you've known for a decade. \n\nWe had barely spoken for 3 minutes. She had just finished telling me about where she worked and where she'd been in the last 10 years when she suddenly got up and said, give me $200 or I'll leave.\n\nMe: I'm sorry. What?\nShe: Give me 200 or I leave.\nMe: Is this a joke? I'm sorry, I'm confused.\nShe: Give me 200 or I leave.\nMe: What is this about? Do I owe you any money?\nShe: Give me 200 or I leave.\nMe: You're free to leave, I guess.\n\nShe got up and left. She had barely touched the coffee and the slice of cake she'd offered me. I was fine with paying for her when the bill came around. I'd basically had 90% and the amount was nothing compared to 200$\n\nNow, I'm confused because, well, she was more caring and respectful in that moment than my nex had been. I mean, she actually asked for the money instead of stealing it. But at the same time, this was not a normal conversation. I find myself confused and suddenly, not AT ALL angry with my nex.\n\nI mean my nex was a typical narcissist, but at least I knew what she was about.\n\nI mean, I hadn't even told this girl anything about myself yet, in the three minutes we'd met, for her to take offence to something I did, even if appropriate.\n\nWhat am I supposed to make of this situation, because the first thing I want to do is talk to my ex, because she never tried to extort money from me?",

        "text": "In reference to a socially aggressive, narcissitic woman, how long does their good person act last before they just cant anymore in a small town? What is your experience ? I live in a small town (32F) My husband  (35M, 5 years) has this destructive ex female friend from high school (31F) who has a rep for being a home wrecker she is aggressively trying to sweep under the rug right now. Years ago he wanted to believe in the good in her.  But he had to cut her off because she simply cannot have a man give another woman more attention. Its insane. I dated a guy when I was younger for a few years who had 3 awesome female friends, so it truly sucked for this one to be terrible. I tried but she is sadly conniving, aggressive and selfish. Shes been gone 3 years now. \nShe moved away and has now moved back. Shes caused 2 divorces since 2017. At one point she sat on the guys lap in front of their now ex partner in the only sports bar we have for all to see. Like boldly being a home wrecker. Tormenting the other woman openly being a sadist. When confronted She said stuff like she was only ‚Äúplaying around and people cant handle her strong vibrant Sun shine like personality, jealous of her etc‚Äù‚Ä¶ Showing people she can do this stuff with no consequence in her mind. \nShe works as a medical assistant and she can be very nice if she wants to be. But she enjoys being in control of people and will create problems for her own gain. So shes known to be a reliable person but can also be awful to work with. She gets off on making people look weak or foolish. Always has to be right. Likes to look like a model citizen‚Ä¶ or leader‚Ä¶ \n\nShe has been telling people she has changed from her past and is broadcasting going to church. \nShe annoys some of us very badly bc she loudly broadcasts how saintly she is now. But I have a weird feeling shes still exactly the same. \nI found out shes been hooking up / heavily flirting with different  guys here and trying to ruin my reputation saying im a horrible person, my husband doesn‚Äôt love me and im jealous of her‚Ä¶ ugh‚Ä¶ to them etc. Its just bc she couldn‚Äôt ruin our relationship, she got cut off due to harassing my husband for attention to try to get to me (didn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶.backfired on her lol) but she cannot ever ‚Äúlose‚Äù bc she has a huge ego. \nShes done this to other people in this area. Luckily im not her biggest target and shes mostly moved on except for occasional spite from what i can tell. I‚Äôve seen how she really is, so I know shes capable of it, but then around some it becomes he said she said. Really irritating. She makes up vile rumors then expects people to see her as this innocent baby angel princess. \n\nUnfortunately some people are believing her ‚Äútransformation‚Äù \nIm curious about how it tends to work out with that manipulative personality where Its like if they cant steal from you or ruin things (theyre actually jealous of) they try to throw dirt on your name. I‚Äôve started going out more and I wont have anything to do with her bc she has an obsessive / aggressive attention seeking personality. But then likes people to think she is this extremely wonderful person‚Ä¶ \nAt some point due to some character assassination shes trying to do its going to be my word against hers sometimes‚Ä¶ \nHow does stuff like this usually turn out? From people who already been through it‚Ä¶ \nI know a lot of people see through her‚Ä¶ \nBut it doesn‚Äôt change how persistent she is to create this transformed suuuper good girl facade. She is a fairly good looking person and she posts tons of selfies with Bible verses and passive aggressive / vague yet  ‚Äúovercoming‚Äù type things. She has a lot of people who are past fed up with her‚Ä¶but she seems to priss off labeling people she has maligned as theyre jealous of her‚Ä¶ I cut dramatic people off but what do you do with  bad people who put so much effort into looking good but do dirty things in the dark without a second thought or guilt ..\nI have a good calm group here. Yet I want to be sure to be smart about doing more in the community here bc she is so conniving and controlling, fake nice. \nTL;DR : woman in my small town has a long public history of home wrecking, but now constantly broadcasts she has changed and puts tons of effort to look pure while still acting nasty , socially aggressive behind closed doors",

        "text": "I have been in 3 relationships with Narcissists but only got discarded by one of them. I went NC with the other two first. The discard happened this year. He ghosted me after telling me he wouldn't pick me up from the airport when I flew back from having cancer surgery. The next day he posted pics on IG of himself having a jolly time walking around his favorite part of the city. I haven't heard from him since.\n\nWe used to live together and he caused fights all the time and was breaking up with me at the worst of it several times a week. I always sensed that these breakups weren't the real deal and I would pick up on little giveaways that he wasn't serious. These storms would pass and there would be a couple of days of calm then the cycle of abuse would repeat.\n\nExhausted by all of this I actually moved out. Then, foolishly, I came back 3 months later although we no longer lived together. When I came back is when devaluation really got going and it was so bad that I was actually looking back to when I lived with him as the good old days.\n\nOne big sign to me that things were headed towards a discard, not just a breakup or empty threats, is when he began showing a new indifference towards me that was never there before. He behaved the way a guy does when he's just not that interested in you anymore. He would cancel plans or casually move around our meetup times. He was much less affectionate and would only send business like texts, though I knew he texted often with friends and family. I could see that he was on WhatsApp all the time while telling me he was too busy to text with me.\n\nBy the end his treatment of me would be, at times, disdainful and very cold. Time with me seemed unimportant to him. It felt like I'd gotten a big demotion. So all of this culminated in him ghosting me after leaving me without a ride home from the airport. He did give me some closure the day before this, telling me in a text that he never wants to see or speak to me again and then saying he doesn't laugh or have fun when he's with me anymore (yeah bc he reserves that for other people!) and we don't have the same tastes (in fact we had many interests in common). He said he wishes to be alone.\n\nI'd heard a lot of this before but what signaled to me it was a genuine discard is how I felt reading this. I could sense that he was done and that it was over. His many breakups always felt like a door had been shut in my face, but I could still hear him moving around on the other side of the door. I would sense that he was going to open it again and he was just torturing me and this is always what happened. This time though was different. He shut the door in my face and then he disappeared. I could no longer hear him on the other side. There was only silence.\n\nIt felt like I'd been released by him from his web and I felt a relief, as by that point I was miserable but wasn't able to leave him. When it was just a breakup I would feel frantic and extremely upset. But when I read his message I felt a sense of peace come over me. I sensed that he had left the building and that any attempt to contact him would be futile. Two days later is when he posted those jolly pics of himself out and about on IG. I thought, this is what it looks like to be discarded by a Narcissist. They treat you like you are dead.\n\nSo for me the difference between a silent treatment/breakup and an actual discard was in how I felt in response. When he discarded me it felt very different and I just knew intuitively what was happening. I didn't get emotional or try to chase after him. When I looked back I could see the devaluation phase and understand that this was coming.\n\nHow did you know it was a discard and not just another silent treatment/breakup/empty threat? I see a lot of things online about this where people are upset and wondering which it is. This has been my experience.",

Meeting him seemed like the cherry on the pie of happy feelings, I was over the moon and thought life was just so generous to me with a new job AND a new boyfriend, who could have guessed!\n\nThings turned out differently, had to run from the new boyfriend as things turned creepy fast. Almost 9 months of shit, because we are both in the same friend group kept seeing him around, which led to mixed feelings of still this strange attraction and the shivers from ever more creepiness. Cut things off finally beginning of October and now sitting here looking back.\n\nThis crap triggered loads of further crap from my childhood again, apart from the stress of being stalked and having to say goodbye to the social events he is attending. I thought I had processed all of this years ago after my first bad relationship, but no, turns out I have more work to do. \n\nThank god I have a very nice team of colleagues and manager, and some of the sweetest friends. They really pulled me through when I wanted to scream and just quit my brand new job and hide under the blankets from all the stress. Past months had many ups and downs but I'm happy to say I feel like I'm getting there. \n\nSymbolic of this, I know he is at the bar tonight where we first kissed. I know I shouldn't know, long story I really can't avoid hearing about him sometimes. I could go there desperate for some attention, for him to see how awesome I am, or whatever. I could be crying now like I did for a pretty long time. Instead, even though I still feel a mixture of nostalgia, hurt and anger, and yes fear as well when I think of him, I stay home and putting together a fitness bench I bought as self care to excercise at home and feel fit. \n\nI hope 2023 will be the year I can leave all this behind me, including healing from the crap from my childhood even more, which put me in this vulnerable position with toxic people in the first place.",

Not things I wanted or would like because she knew me, just a checklist of kitchen utensils, pots, pressure cookers, fondue kit, etc. All bad quality, off-brand. The message was : you're on your own, you will settle now, don't come home. I wasn't settled, I hadn't finished school. Basically she gave me gifts that were controlling and telling me to get out of the house (I was in a college dorm).\n\nOne year, my mom said \"don't you need a camera ? You don't even have one.\" True. But I didn't feel the need for one. But yes, it was missing in my arsenal. Why not. How unpractical and... indulgent. No pasta strainer this year, uh ?\n\nShe ordered the camera with my father's coupons that he would get from his job as a perk, so that the gifts didn't really cost them anything anyway. Still, gift horse, mouth, etc.\n\nI was to get a Canon point and shoot. Cool.\n\nBut it wasn't the one I was promised. I didn't really care and wasn't set on getting the camera, and I hadn't chosen the model anyway.\n\nAnd then she explained : she had bought this at the last moment 8 hours prior (as opposed as 3 months prior when she first showed me the Canon -- we would open gifts on the 24th before dinner). \n\nIt was a nondescript brand from the supermarket.  Since my camera wouldn't come until January, MY SISTER would use the Canon point-and-shoot for herself (on top of her gifts), since she was doing photography anyway, she would have more use for a quality camera, whereas this one would do just fine for me.\n\nI said I might have waited a bit,  and my mom said \"nonsense, you had to have SOMETHING under the tree\".\n\nThis was the year when my sister got my christmas present because it would have been wasted on me.",

        "text": "Not sure if a TW is necessary, but this is about spiritual narcissism, or at least I believe so.\n\nIt's been almost a year since an event with two people and it still partially lingering in me.\n\nThis story is about two people, S &amp; E. Sorry if it's very long, I'm omitting several details but even so, it's long.\n\nS was a friend of mine with whom I had been friends for around 3 years. We bonded over spiritual matters and love for photography and creativity. We used to go on photography adventures in remote areas of our region while discussing spirituality, and send each other endless voice messages when we couldn't meet. We felt we both only had very few people we could openly talk about spirituality with, so we cherished this friendship. We also helped each other analyse daily events through a spiritual lens. We talked openly about only wanting a friendship off each other, not a relationship. At times he was a bit too reckless while out of in nature for my more prudent attitude, and I think I pissed him off a few times for not joining in on a couple of adventures, but aside from that everything felt ok. We had different takes on some spiritual matters, but being able to compare and dive deep was really something that added to our explorations.\n\nThe other person, E, is the sister of my ex partner M, who I have known superficially for years, only seeing her at M's family events. She's involved in a very closed, and from my perspective quite suspicious, religious group, revolving around a central guru who controls members and speaks on behalf of a god that only the guru can hear, so the whole family has been alarmed about this for years. In the summer of 2021 she broke up with someone I know, in part because of this guru, and wanted to meet up to offload. I accepted and we went out a few times to talk. She seemed to mean well but was quite judgemental and fixed on her spiritual views, often deeming others low-vibe, deciding who was a true spiritual person and who was only fooling oneself, often talking over others, diagnosing spiritual ailments in others, and trying to convince me to get therapies from her. All of that made me quite uncomfortable, but I attributed that to the influence of the guru and felt bad about her seeming so sad about her breakup and having very few friends. I felt like I could at least be more or less open about my spirituality with her, even if I never felt comfortable enough in sharing as much with her as I did with S. Plus I have a good friendship with my ex M, and felt that it was a good thing to do to try and support her sister, whom M was quite worried about, like the rest of her family. We only went out a few times, so I thought that even if she wasn't completely my cup of tea I could manage that, and she did seem to be well meaning and to appreciate the time I spent with her.\n\nAfter a while she asked me to be introduced to S, as she heard me talk about him and the fact that he was kind, creative and spiritual. I saw nothing wrong with that, S was always looking out for more people he could explore spirituality with, plus I've always loved to introduce people and get my friends to be friends with each other, so I did introduce them, warning him about the fact that she was a bit more dogmatic than us but overall well meaning. We went out all three of us a few times until they felt comfortable going out by themselves and they eventually started dating. She asked me a lot about the background of my friendship with S, and why we never got into a relationship. I didn't see anything wrong with that question, considering opposite sex friendships still make some people perplexed, and I openly said that while we were great as friends, we always knew we wouldn't be compatible as partners and we had talked about it several times and were happy that way. She asked if I ever had any trouble with him, and I replied that aside some nervousness when he tried to get me to climb stuff or curl into caves, I was always completely relaxed around him, that he's very gentle and kind. I also mentioned that a few times he got annoyed at me for not going to stuff (I tend to overwork and take on too many projects and this is a complaint I get from literally everyone in my life).\n\nAfter our first dinner all three of us, she told me she thought he was attracted to me and that probably he put me in those risky situations so I would cling to him and get closer, but I responded I really didn't think that was the case and this worry never resurfaced. Our second dinner together had a great atmosphere I thought, and I remember thinking that they could balance each other quite well, and S seemed to make E less fixed and dogmatic. From then on, I left them alone so they could shape their own relationship. I was ready for my friendship with S to adjust around this. As a woman with many male friends over the years (and a full faith that friendship is possible amongst any orientation, age, nationality, humanity, planthood whatever!), I'm quite used to take a back seat as a friend when a male friend gets into a relationship, and I would never want the new gf to feel treathened, which is quite natural when your new bf has a close female friend.\n\nFast forward several months and I go back to my village for Christmas last year (I live abroad for most of the year). They both (who had become bf and gf meanwhile) reached out to me to go out and S asked me which places I would like to hike to this time. I responded a specific place with a temple (a stunning place around my homevillage).\n\nAfter that me and my family got into quarantine because my nephew tested positive for covid and I ended up spending the rest of my holidays locked at my parents' house, which I thought was actually convenient as I had to finish up my PhD thesis for submission, and I was really stressed and full of work anyway. In all of this, I forgot completely about plans to go hiking.\n\nA few days into quarantine, E wrote to me to say she was sorry that my hiking plans were joepardised by the quarantine and to let S know as he was expecting we would still go. She then said she felt a bit left out that I didn't include her in this hiking plan. I responded that I was taking for granted we would all go, it wasn't an exclusive invitation, just a suggestion of a place. I was genuinely taking for granted they were talking to each other about this, as we were all texting. Other friends of mine were planning to come hiking to the same location as well, if it wasn't for the quarantine.\n\nAll of a sudden S calls me in tears, saying that E wanted me out of their lives and had demanded him to stop seeing me unless he wanted to break up with her, because in one of her spiritual practices she had channeled that I was infected by some sort of spiritual ailment, I was a negative entity. She said she could \"see\" that I was keeping him as a friend just to have him drool over me, that I do that with men in general. She also told him that I had complained to her that I felt really uncomfortable being alone with him because he kept on putting me at risks just to prove how macho he is, and that I said it was obvious he was in love with me and I complained about this with her and others, and a whole load of bullshit I never said. Through her \"spiritual practice and channeling\", she also claimed I was plotting to go hiking with him alone to that location to reinforce his bond to me, to always have him attracted to me.\n\nHe was both shocked by her ultimatum and heartbroken I would say those things, asking me if I really did. He was completely agitated and reminded me immediately of me and a narcissistic abusive ex (K) who had gaslighted me so badly years before. I completely recognised the cognitive dissonance in him and tried to handle it as sensitively as I could, without antagonising her, but also obviously stating I never said nor intended those things. We talked for over an hour and it took me a lot of self control to not simply react with anger, but I tried to keep as calm as possible and tried to support him as I could. I then wrote to her that I had learned about the situation and it was fine for me to cut our relationship (I meant me and E). I wasn't expecting anything from S as this was his situation to sort out with her, and I would have accepted and understood if he had decided not to be friends with me for the time being, for, as sad as it is, I did the same when I was with my abusive ex K, I got distant to so many friends, and I know that making him feel guilty about it would have been the worst thing to do and just caused him to feel misunderstood and alone. I knew how badly he wanted a relationship back then, and I didn't feel it was my place to highlight how bad giving ultimatums like this is or that I thought she was using spirituality to manipulate the end of this friendship. I simply told him I never said those things, I undestood why he felt overwhelmed and confused, and that I would have understood if he preferred to keep a distance for a bit, or if he otherwise wanted support I was there for him.\n\nHowever, I wasn't really prepared for what happened later. First, E got super upset with S because apparently he wasn't supposed to report to me any of that (in fact all along she was acting very nice and sweet to me ) and they went into a fight. They met and spoke and, by the end of the evening he started to become convinced that I was indeed a negative spiritual entity, and that probably she could see sides of me that he could not. He wrote to me saying he was happy that he could also see the good parts of me in the past, but now that they spoke, he could see why she thought what she thought, and that over the years I had worked hard to only show him my good side. He also said that he hadn't known me long enough to be sure that she was wrong about me, and that he didn't know anyone who knew me long enough to fully prove I wasn't what she described me to be (which was crazy, because he knows my brother as well as two of my closest best friends I have had since childhood). I was really hurt by that. One thing is putting some distance if you are being pushed around by a gf you have fallen for, one is to actually believe all of this, especially when I made sure for our entire friendship with him to be as transparent and real as possible, and especially when there were years of unpacking our dreams, prayers, manifestations, ideas, research, all of it, I never held anything back. But now he thought he didn't know me better than someone that only went out with me a handful of times.\n\nIn spite of being hurt, I sort of understood what he was reationalising. S had recently lost his grandma and apparently had a seance with E, and E had managed, according to him, to communicate with the grandma, something he was wishing for so hard. That for him was a proof that she was telling the truth about me too because she could see things we could not.\n\nAt this point I was sick of both of them, disappointed with myself for having trusted E in the first place, but also really perplexed about S' friendship overall, as I have some many other dear friends, who are maybe not as spiritual, but still would never have believed I could speak like that about them or that I was plotting to ruin a couple etc. Even at my worst with K, I got distant from friends for fear of losing him, not because I ever believed my friends were bad for me (and I still hurt them by doing so).\n\nI stopped responding to both and just focused on my thesis while being pissed off. A couple of days later, S wrote to me again, this time begging me to meet with him and E to hear her theory about me, so that I could respond/defend myself at least. Bear in mind this was ONE DAY before submitting my thesis, the result of 4 years of mad work and the most important step I had taken in months, workwise. Submitting a PhD thesis is one of the most stressful times of an academic career, plus they were basically asking me to breach my quarantine, which I wasn't doing even to see my beloved nephew and niece, my sister, my best friends, no one. I was shocked that at least S didn't seem to care about any of this and just kept asking over and over that I would go there and listen to this theory about me. For some mysterious reason, this encounter could only happen that day and it was my only chance to \"fix\" things.\n\nI told them to leave me alone and that I had no intention to withstand whatever process that was because I had nothing to prove. I was quite happy with myself that I set this boundary, because in the past with K I would constantly over-explain myself when he accused me of crazy stuff and I know now that the more you try to defend and justify yourself with someone who has narcissistic tendencies, the more you get sucked into an endless cycle of abuse.\n\nE kept texting me horrible texts (bear in mind until a week before she would call me love, send me kisses at the end of every message, being super sweet etc etc), saying that I prefer to hide behind a phone than facing my truth, that I was playing the victim as usual (?), that until I stopped lying my life would be ruined, and other accusations, including that I spent money on a tattoo instead of buying a therapy off her, sign that I didn't really want to progress spiritually, and other BS following which I decided to block her.\n\nSince then (a year go) S has never spoken or reached out to me again. E has done all she could to also get her brother to stop being my friend, including reporting other lies, but M wasn't fooled by this and we are still friends to this day. She has tried to get the rest of their family to turn against me, and since then their mum removed me from social media (which is not a big deal for me really), while their dad keeps being nice to me when I bump into him. She also kept a smear campaign with some of her friends, who I barely know, no one I really worry about. After a few months E and S broke up, M told me.\n\nNow, I have reflected so much about all of this, I have meditated, processed, journaled, cleansed, all of it. I have unpacked how this situation triggered what happened with my ex K, how I felt betrayed by S for believing those things. I have a good awareness I think of what got E to become narcissist (childhood abuse) and I fully understand that S wanted to desperately believe that the seance with his grandma was real, and to fully believe that, he had to believe that E was acting in good faith overall. I have some compassion for both of them but I also think I'm better off without them, and even if they would ever apologise (they won't), I have no intention of resuming contact with either of them.\n\nThere are often weeks or even months when I forget about all of this, but there is still every now and then a resurgence of those feelings of being misunderstood and most of all a need for wanting to explain to S why he was wrong about me. I don't really feel like I want to be his friend again, but just this need of wanting him to understand that he was fooled.\n\nI don't understand why a year later I still feel this need. This happens especially when I'm back home here. It's a small village and a few days ago E drove past me and looked at me with such sheer hate. This also makes me feel so uneasy, as I remember from my past experiences with narcissists how long their hate lasts and how much damage they can do if they have the chance. There's not much she can practically do but I still so wish she would forget about my existence.\n\nOverall, I do believe that if an event still bothers us and we can't fully let it go, it's because something is still active in it, something needs to come up (not with them, as I have no intention to reach out to either of them, but with myself), some shadow side that I need to address. Perhaps I was too calm in all of it and now I have pent up anger? I did try to express it by journaling and venting, and to me it feels like there's something else going on here. Maybe it was lack of a proper closure. Perhaps I should have handled it differently.\n\nMaybe by reading this overly long story, you might be able to suggest to me what I should do or look at to fully let this go and spot what keeps me from freeing myself completely from this story. Thank you!\n\nps - for context we are 38,37,32 so not kids or youngsters",

        "text": "Thanks for the the positive comments the other day. Here's the very final chapter of the book that I posted a taster of:\n\n**Chapter 58**\n\n**Thursday, 25 October 2018**\n\nThere‚Äôs not much to say to each other in the morning. We get up. Make coffee. Undertake more or less the same routine that we‚Äôve been going through for the last 18 years. I clear away the duvet and pillows from the sofa that‚Äôs been my wife‚Äôs bed for the last few months and we sit in silence watching Piers Morgan on GMTV as he talks over another victim. Except we‚Äôre not really watching at all. The air of melancholy that floods the room is palpable. Like a living, breathing entity.\n\nShe gets dressed downstairs. Me upstairs. Her plan is to take the train to Brighton today and return on Sunday, by which time I‚Äôll be long gone. It‚Äôs her dad‚Äôs birthday and everyone‚Äôs going out for a meal in the evening. I was even invited at one point but that was impossible of course. Our daughter has been in Brighton since Monday, the last time I saw her; the last time I might see her in a very long time. When my wife finally emerges ‚Äì makeup flawlessly applied as usual ‚Äì she looks beautiful. Just beautiful. And I want her even more than ever.\n\nThe tears come intermittently. From both of us. But the words refuse to appear. Everything we‚Äôve ever had to say to each other has already been said. The sun is shining today. It‚Äôs a lovely day for a funeral. A lovely day for the death rattle of the most important relationship of my life.\n\nShe asks me if I‚Äôd like to walk with her to the tube station and naturally I can‚Äôt refuse. So we leave the flat together one last time, arm in arm, both of us wiping away tears from the corners of our eyes. We take a slow stroll down the Archway Road and the memories come back to mock me. Of course they do. How many times have we walked down this road together? Probably thousands of times over the last 15 years. In my mind it‚Äôs ten years earlier and I can picture us pushing our baby girl in her pram. Her little face giggling or complaining about something. I can see the three of us, our little unit: my wife, my daughter and I, drenched in happiness, united against the world. Where did it go wrong? What happened to bring us here to this point in time? I‚Äôll never be able to understand. I know that for sure.\n\nWe get close to the tube station and slow down to a standstill. ‚ÄòWell I guess you‚Äôre going that way and I‚Äôm going this,‚Äô I murmur, pointing into the distance, scarcely able to force the words out from my trembling lips. We stop and wrap our arms around each other. We cling together for several long moments. Every second has now become a marker; in this case a marker that signifies the last time I will ever see my wife. The last time I will smell her. The last time I will feel her body heat against mine. I fight to hold back the sobs.\n\nWe kiss. Another milestone: the last time I will ever kiss the woman I love. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre the love of my life‚Ä¶‚Äô she says softly, as she has said to me so many times before. Only this time with inestimable sadness.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure that she can hear my feeble response: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre fucking fabulous,‚Äô I splutter.\n\nThen our bodies pull apart and she slowly moves to cross the road. I turn away as she disappears into a crowd of commuters on their way to work. I don‚Äôt want to see her go. I just can‚Äôt look.\n\nThat‚Äôs it. Over. All done.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI‚Äôm in a daze, a mindless trance. I have no control as I go through the motions of navigating the saddest day of my entire life. I pick up a prescription from the chemist‚Äôs, a bulk order intended to last me a couple of months. I buy some food, although my body is crying out for sustenance I know that it will remain uneaten. I make sure I have lots of alcohol. Tonight I‚Äôm going to need it.\n\nI take some MDMA ‚Äì too much MDMA ‚Äì and later in the afternoon I begin to pack a bag. I look through my possessions and realise that there‚Äôs nothing I want to keep. Nothing I want to take with me for my new life, wherever that‚Äôs going to be. My new life without my wife and daughter. In the end I cram a few T-shirts, some underwear, some jeans, a few jackets, phone chargers, etc. into a trolley case; the exact same case that my wife took to New York four months earlier. Except, of course, she wasn‚Äôt going to New York on that occasion. She was going to Parkham Street. 33 Parkham Street. If I could leave with nothing I would. Because everything smells of the past, of a life which I no longer belong to.\n\nI‚Äôm up until three or four in the morning. As has been my habit throughout all of this. I listen to anonymous music as I aimlessly flip through Netflix. And I cry. And I cry. And I cry again.\n\nThe moon casts a white glow over the sitting room as I print out the two letters I have written: one for my daughter, one for my wife. I sign them and seal them in envelopes which I place on the mantelpiece.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Friday, 26 October 2018**\n\nThe next morning I awaken fully dressed on the sofa, which still smells of my wife. I go into the bathroom and inspect my face in the mirror as I clean my teeth: the thin, wrinkled, worried face of an old man. There are deep bags under my eyes that weren‚Äôt there in the summer. Just as my life has changed completely so have I changed physically. I‚Äôm a different person now: almost unrecognisable from the man I was before all the lies.\n\nI smoke. I drink coffee. I smoke. I go into my daughter‚Äôs room and give her rabbits more food. She now has two rabbits. They will be alone for three days so I pile up the straw and scatter vegetables around their cage; I fill up their water dispensers. Then I cram a few more possessions into my case and reach a decision. And as I reach that decision I hear a familiar noise from my iPad. A message:\n\n**Her:** I just woke up! 12 hrs sleep. My god. I needed it. You up yet?\n\n**Me:** Yes\n\n**Me:** Slight change of plan. I‚Äôm going now.\n\n**Her:** Oh OK.\n\n**Me:** I Don‚Äôt want to be here any longer. Have left food and water for the rabbits.\n\n**Her:** OK.\n\n**Me:** I will turn off messaging in about an hour. You can only contact me under extreme circumstances via that email I gave you.

I‚Äôve explained everything in the letter to her.\n\n**Her:** Oh my is that what you said?\n\n**Me:** What I said is between me and her.\n\n**Her:** So it‚Äôs your mothers fault basically\n\n**Me:** My mother?\n\n**Her:** She‚Äôll show me of course\n\n**Her:** No her mother\n\n**Me:** I‚Äôm sure she will.\n\n**Me:** Well of course it‚Äôs your fault. You did this to us.\n\n**Me:** Not me.\n\n**Her:** Ok\n\n**Her:** I‚Äôll leave you to go. This isn't helpful\n\n**Me:** Ok. Enjoy the rest of your life.\n\n**Her:** Stop it\n\n**Her:** We‚Äôll be in touch again\n\n**Her:** I‚Äôll make sure we are\n\n**Me:** I can promise you we‚Äôll never be in the same room ever again. You have that guy now. Don‚Äôt do this to him.\n\n**Her:** Stop it\n\n**Me:** What do you want me to do?\n\n**Her:** Have a break and get your head together and then eventually we can become friends properly\n\n**Her:** That‚Äôs what I want\n\n**Me:** Never friends with you.\n\n**Her:** I love you and you‚Äôll always be my best friend\n\n**Me:** You don‚Äôt deserve my friendship.\n\n**Me:** You‚Äôve torn me to pieces with your lies and your cheating.\n\n**Her:** Ok let‚Äôs talk again soon pls\n\n**Me:** Never\n\n**Her:** Ok\n\n**Me:** Ok.

        "text": "After 6 years of hell trying to make things right with my family of origin, I finally went \"no contact\" with all of them three days ago. They have been the three most emotionally turbulent days of my life and, quite frankly, I'm really glad Christmas is over.\n\nI've been married to a truly amazing and kind woman (40f) for 17 years. 17 years ago everyone loved her and she was instantly accepted. The first 12 years were magical. It was the family dynamic I always hoped I would have when I found \"the one.\" She's so kind, in fact, that when she saw my brother and SIL taking financial advantage of my parents, she called them on it.\n\nI realize now that my brother is a narcissist and my wife triggered his shame. Shortly after, brother and SIL decided that my wife wasn't allowed to see their young children anymore which was really shocking to everyone. I've never seen someone use their kids like that. My wife and their oldest were really good for each other and it's tragic that that relationship was crushed like that. My brother and SIL have lied to their children and told them that we moved far away when really we live 15 min away.\n\nI made the hard decision to side with my wife. If she can't see the kids, I can't either. It really sucks but I know in my heart I have to. I'm not going to be a member of a club that she isn't allowed to be. Especially a club as fucked up as that one. But, I'm left with the bitter taste of not know my three nephews and having my brother, mother, abd father passively aggressively remind me of what a shitty uncle I'm being.\n\nI've since learned that my father is narcissist, my mom is codependent, and my brother is both narcissist + golden child. Mom is histrionic. I grew up with truly terrible OCD from 8-13 y/o that were marked by some of the most horrific and intrusive thoughts I've ever had before in my life. OCD is still here but in a much more productive way in my career. \n\nIt's been a rough six years. I'm really fortunate my wife loves me as much as she does because I've said really ugly things to her over that time from a place of hurt, confusion, and anger.\n\nI set a boundary with my mom and dad that my relationship was with the just the two of them and nobody else. I wasn't going to be responsible for trying to mend any other relationships. They've been putting a lot of pressure on me to mend things between them and my wife and teen child.\n\nI tried to do Christmas with them but, after telling them again that it would just be me, my mom started crying and, when I told her that my wife didn't feel safe because she kept crossing her boundaries, my mom got mad at all this \"boundaries bullshit.\"\n\nMy dad texted from my mom's phone and said \"message received. we won't bother you anymore. dad.\" I just blocked them. I tried so hard and I can't do it anymore. I feel like I should have given them a warning before but I was just so hurt and it wasn't meant to be comforting. My mom always reminds me that she loves me but the last three times I said it she didn't respond and it just hurts so much.\n\nSo many feelings right now. The absolutely devastated pain from three days ago is slowly giving away to relief but every day I'm just feeling layer after layer of painful emotion. This Christmas was so different. We didn't up a tree or anything and it's been a month of creating new traditions.\n\nI'm so anxious about their next move and I hate that. I'm having to learn the difference between guilt and feeling sad for someone I love (my parents in particular) because I'm always afraid of feeling guilty again like I have for so much of the last 6 years.\n\nIt was good to write all this down and I really welcome your stories and thoughts. üôè",

After a lot of therapy I have found peace and balance. \n\nHowever, the narc has got married to one of his enablers a person who is just as toxic as he is.  I recently heard he has become ostracised from his family (who enabled his abuse towards me and my children) and she is pretty much controlling him. \n\nThey still don't speak out about it and continue the facade of being a wholesome family. \n\nI'm not gloating but I always knew she would be his karma.",

        "text": "TW: suicide \nShould have realized this earlier but there was def a N in my now totally collapsed group of friend. Hear me out‚Ä¶ this one is crazy\n\nI was never really friends with her, probably because there was nothing she wanted of me (read I wasn‚Äôt good supply) but she was friends with other couples who were exactly like her and her husband. The only reason she became friends with me is because she was looking for a job and she was interested in the company I worked for/wanted me to refer her. \n\nI consistently got excluded from lots of friends gathering, birthdays, weekends away we‚Äôre all happening with my friends behind my back and somehow my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù knew it was wrong but never said anything to her, they were just happy they made the list. \n\nOne of my ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends got particularly targeted by the N friend. Their friendship seems to be the closest, yet the N friend was regularly abusing her and triangulating her. She complained to me many times and I told her that she needed to set boundaries and/or cut ties. But she never did and always said that things got better blah blah blah so she still stayed. Meanwhile I was seeing how textbook that N friend was with everyone. \n\nUnfortunately, the husband of the ‚Äúreal‚Äù friend commits suicide and guess who completely takes over? N friend now owns ‚Äúreal‚Äù friend. Takes her to her house, becomes her savior and starts doing heavy gate keeping around her. To the point where I felt like I couldn‚Äôt communicate straight to my friend and had to go through N friend. I was heavily involved in organizing the funeral, did all the dirty work, dropped what I was doing many times to just go help with something and never got any credit (nor did I expect any but my point is that I was a really good friend and swallowed my pride of being bossed around by N). N friend did nothing, except for providing emotional support and build an even stronger bond with her victim. \n\nEverything got back to somewhat normal, my ‚Äúreal‚Äù friend goes home to her family, we‚Äôre texting etc. Yet a few weeks later after her not responding to my texts anymore, I realized  she blocked me from everywhere (phone, social media, even LinkedIn!). No explanation. \n\nI hadn‚Äôt seen N friend in a while or my other friends in that group after the events but realized that they had also gone silent. And so did I tbh because I knew this group was toxic and everything revolved around N. \n\nA whole year goes by, I still don‚Äôt have any news from anyone but I run into N in my neighborhood. Fuck. I can‚Äôt cross the street, it‚Äôs too late. So I decided to say hi. She is walking like she owns the street and her life is amazing. She acknowledges me, I ask how she is and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing great, everything is great, and you?‚Äù With a big fake smile on her face. Seeing that she was playing pretend, I said the same and then quickly continued my walk. But what a bitch! These are people that I used to celebrate Christmas, NYE with. People that I went on weekends with. I have no idea what happened or why I was blocked and basically shunned by everyone in that group of friend but I vote for smear campaign by N. I think she knows I know she‚Äôs a N and her tactics don‚Äôt work on me so for her that sad event was a way to get a stronger grip on my poor friend and shun me out. \n\nI eventually blocked N friend, and I‚Äôm considering blocking her husband too even though he did nothing to me. Next time I see them I‚Äôll pretend I don‚Äôt know them. \n\nI was raised by a N, dated several narcs and now that I‚Äôve become aware I feel like I see them everywhere.",

He could cuddle, hold my hand, but I just needed more.\n\nI often fantasized and still do about being kissed passionately, having great sex, being told I‚Äôm amazing, loved etc.. \n\nAnd thus I have 2 questions:\n\n1. How do I know I‚Äôm not the one narcissistic here if I crave this so much?\n\n2. Am I setting myself up for another narcissistic relationship, wanting to be love bombed? How do I get what I need and want, but can recognize when it‚Äôs unhealthy?\n\nI never had this passionate love bombing stage with my husband. \n\nThank you!",
