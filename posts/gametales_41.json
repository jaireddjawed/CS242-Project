        "text": "My first time posting in this sub, and it’s about the first campaign I ever played.  It’s been 10+ years since all of this happened, so bear with me.  I hope you enjoy.\n\nThe System: \n\nPalladium Fantasy Role Playing Game with more than a little homebrew.  \n\nThe Cast:\n\n**DM:** Josh.  The only grade school teacher I’ve ever met with full sleeve tattoos.  He would also reward good RP with a bypassed roll or a few extra XP.\n\n\n**LN Human Fighter:** Matt.  A pretty hardcore RP’er.  His fighter is the quintessential military man, straight forward and not unwilling to knock some heads together to get things done.\n\n**LG Human Cleric of Ra:** John.  He’s a fuckin’ loon, but his cleric is pious and deeply devoted to his duties.\n\n**TN Halfling Rogue:** Mark.  His halfling’s constant scorn of proper footwear may or may not come back to bite him in the ass when he steps barefoot into Hell.\n\nThe Setting:\n\nGeneric Medieval Fantasy World that may or may not have had a name.\n\nThe Story:\n\nJohn's order had received word that something strange had begun to happen at a nearby township, and he had been tasked with finding out what was going on.  Villagers had reported hearing strange sounds in the night and woken to find scratches on their doors and livestock missing.  There also had been reports of travelers going missing on the road.  \n\nThe Church of Ra had enlisted the aid of the city guard, and they were going to send a guardsman with him as an escort/second driver for the small covered cart they were to be riding.\n\nThe two meet just outside of town after spending their traveling stipends in the local market to begin the three day journey to the town.  Together, they make good progress and camp for the night just shy of the half-way point of the trip when they heard a small yawn from the back of the cart.\n\n“Uh,” John said, looking at Matt, “what was that?”\n\nMatt lifted up the tarp covering the cart’s bed to reveal a Halfling bundled up in the fighter’s cloak rubbing sleep from his eyes.  “What the hell?” he shouted and sprang to his feet.\n\n“Why are you shouting?” Mark muttered through another yawn.  He looked around and saw a wide canopy of stars instead of the familiar crush of towering buildings.  The young rogue hopped to his feet and pointed an accusatory finger at the two humans.  “Where are you taking me?”\n\n“Taking you?” John asked, still confused as to how the Halfling had ended up in the back of their cart.\n\nMark brought his hands up to his mouth and stifled a gasp.  “Is this a kidnapping?  Somebody help!” he screamed.\n\n“What?” Matt snapped.  “No!  You’re in *our* cart!”\n\nMark shook his head.  “This cart belongs to the Church of Ra, not you!”\n\nThe Cleric showed the excitable Halfling the emblem of his order in the form of a medallion hanging from a golden chain.  “I’m a member of the church, and I don’t think I’ve seen you among the parishioners…”\n\n“Well… That’s, uh… because I’m homeless and wanted a place to sleep?”\n\n“So you decided to climb into a moving cart to take a nap?” Matt asked.\n\nMark looked from one incredulous face to the other.  “Yes?”\n\n“And you didn’t wake up at all as we were questioned by the city guard on our departure, or when we bounced up and down on the road?”\n\n“I’m a heavy sleeper!” Mark protested.\n\nJohn hopped down from the driver’s seat and pulled back the rest of the tarp, revealing only a few pieces of the fighter’s armor and some various supplies.  “Where’s all of our food?”\n\nMatt’s frown turned to a glare.  “We had three days of food, theif!  What did you do with it?”\n\n“I ate it?”\n\nThe glare turned to The Stare of Death ^TM .  “So, you climbed into a moving cart, ate THREE DAYS worth of food, and went to sleep, all without us knowing?”\n\n“I’m very sneaky?”\n\n“You’re an idiot,” John muttered.\n\n“You’re going to jail,” Matt corrected, drawing his longsword.  “I’m placing you under arrest, surrender all of your weapons.  We’ll take you back to town in the morn-”\n\nMark, being the only one not staring at the Halfling, saw something shamble out of the darkness.  Its dark eye-less sockets turned to them, and the zombie began to moan as it moved toward them.  He whipped a small knife out from his sleeve and caught the undead monster in the head, but the beast seemed undeterred as it continued approaching.\n\nMatt spun about, swinging his longsword at the zombie, lopping off one of its arms, as John called down a pillar of cleansing light upon the monster.  The monster crumbled to ash under the Sun God’s wrath, but invoking such a powerful display of power left the cleric exhausted and more moans issued from the darkness.\n\nScrambling over to dig his throwing knife from the ashes, Mark looked over his shoulder at the two men.  “I don’t think you’ll be arresting me right now.  Those moans are coming from the direction we came.  We need to get out of here.”\n\nThe fighter nodded his agreement, and the three climbed back onto the cart.  John gave the horse its reins, and they leapt into the night, leaving the approaching moans behind.\n\nAfter a few hours of bumpy riding, Mark noticed that both the fighter and cleric were exhausted.  Neither of them had rested at all while riding earlier in the day, instead pondering what plight had befallen the village we were now scrambling toward.  When the cart began to veer from the road, forcing the cleric to pull hard at the reins to avoid a tree, the Halfling decided to take action.\n\n“You two rest in the back as best you can.  I can drive the cart through the night.”\n\n“Not happening,” Matt said.  “I don’t know or trust you.”\n\n“Have you even driven a horse-drawn cart before?” John asked.\n\n“I drive them for my Pa all the time.”\n\nMatt’s eyes narrowed.  “I thought you said you were homeless.”\n\nThe Halfling nodded, his eyes looking down.  “I am…  I *used* to drive them for him all the time.  He’s not… around anymore.”\n\n“Likely story, Thief,” Matt said.  “Why should I believe you?”  \n\nMark muttered something that was drowned out by the sound of the wooden wheels bouncing on the road.  \n\n“What was that?” John asked.\n\n“He sold me into slavery!” Mark screamed at the top of his lungs.  \n\nJohn pulled on the reins, and the horse slowed.  “What did you say?”\n\nTears began to run down the Halfling’s face, and his voice came out in a choked whisper.  “My father, he was a good man, but he had a gambling problem.  He went afoul of some members of the thieves guild, and he sold me into slavery to settle his debts.  It took me six months to escape, but when I finally made it home, the thieves’ guild had killed him.”\n\n“What of your mother?” Matt asked, sensing that the Halfling was telling the truth.\n\n“I don’t have no mother.  Not one that I ever knew.  Been living on the streets for the last few months.”\n\nThe fighter and the cleric shared a glance, and they both climbed into the back of the cart, leaving the Halfling to take the reins.  “You know where we’re headed?”\n\n“No,” Mark admitted.\n\n“Just follow the road until sunrise, then we’ll make camp,” John said.  “The undead must seek refuge during the day.”\n\nMark nodded and whipped the reins.  He wiped the tears from his eyes and was angry at himself over the unusual outburst of emotion.  Some time had passed, but when he looked at the two men, he saw they were sleeping peacefully, though the fighter had fallen asleep with his hand on his drawn sword.\n\n[Link to Next Part](http://redd.it/2r6muu)",

        "text": "The party: One dragonborn fire mage who likes to set everything on fire, one dragonborn ranger who is a pirate, one reluctant shifter cleric of Ioun, one hill giant warden, intelligence 8, who misses his sheep and gets drunk a lot, and me, a tiefling rogue with a penchant for shurikens and fuzzy things.\n\nWe have just shipwrecked, because the fire mage challenged the hill giant to a drinking contest then accidentally set our ship on fire. The ranger loots the wreckage and finds a comedically large sword. As we wander across the plains we have found ourselves on, we see a stone with, coincidentally, a slot just the right size for the comedic-sized sword. We make the logical assumption and convince the ranger to insert his sword. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l4ooX0ZZlk) bastard appears. He takes us to his magical, trap-filled dungeon where the walls change and then disappears, leaving us to navigate it alone. After fighting some absurd monsters, learning the hard way why we trap-check things *first*, and skating across a floor of ice, the fairy wish prince appears again to guide us, because the DM is tired of us wandering aimlessly.\n\nEventually, we reach a room filled with chests of treasure. I trap-check then open the chest I've designated as mine and a hand reaches out, holding a red ball. The party queries the DM and, pressed for an answer, he decides that the hand has come from a transdimensional K-Mart. Excellent, we say, we're going. \n\n\"Oh, fuck it, why not?\" Our DM is more than a little fed up with the party by this point - the fire mage is sporting a brand of Kossoth on his arm that covers up his bungled tattoo, the pirate is sulking because he failed as a pirate, the cleric has spent a lot of time in orgies, the rogue fell on her face in an encounter specifically designed for her, and the hill giant is still trying to let his moss filter the alcohol out of his system. \n\nSo we climb into the transdimensional K-Mart. It is grim and gloomy and the employees are surprisingly unintimidated by our half-beast group. We pick up a few supplies and climb back out of the K-Mart. At this point, the fire mage notices my red ball. \"What's that? I want to see it!\" he says. \"No, it's mine and you can't have it,\" declares the grouchy rogue who's just discovered that the fire mage has her missing shurikens. He had diplomacy'd me into believing that I stole my own shurikens after they had gone missing while he was watching, and he had received them back from his treasure chest.\n\n\"Fine,\" he says, then proceeds to roll a 34 diplomacy check to persuade me to hand it over. I roll a 34 thievery check to steal it back. He rolls a nat 20 diplomacy check to persuade it away from me again. The DM, long since fed up with our fire mage's antics, declares that the red ball is soulbound to me, and the mage can't have it anymore. He pouts, I celebrate, but we still have no clue what it is. We make our way out of the dungeon and find a town, where the DM tells us that the red ball is the Communist Sphere of Influence that grants a +5 to any skill check that helps the whole party. Our DM is a history major who is extremely fond of communism. I use the sphere to help get us into the port town which is extremely suspicious of outsiders and unwilling to let us in easily. Then we go looking for an inn.\n\nThe inn we finally locate wants to charge us 20 gold a night per person. We are all outraged by the absurdity of that price, so we attempt to bargain with the innkeeper. Using the Communist Sphere of Influence, the tiefling rogue rolls a nat 20. The DM sighs, shakes his head, then says, \"The innkeeper has had a sudden change of heart and thinks that communism is an excellent idea. He offers you the rooms for free, and appears to be growing a spectacular beard as you watch. In fact, if you suggested it, he'd probably help you with a violent communist revolution.\"\n\n\"VIOLENT COMMUNIST REVOLUTION!!!\" exclaims the rogue. \"We must have a violent communist revolution!\"\n\nThe DM: [...](http://imgur.com/iWKad22) \"Fine.\"\n\nOur hill giant, who up to this point has been relatively quiet, suddenly says, \"Can we convince him to rename his inn 'The Revolush'?\" \"I guess,\" says our poor worn out DM. \"He'll go along with pretty much anything at this point. Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" the hill giant says, far too pleased, \"Then it would be The Revolush Inn.\" Cue collective groan from the party.\n\nAnd that is how I secured my legacy as the worst rogue ever.",

        "text": "So my usual DM also runs a publishing company for tabletops and such, and has been working on a Savage Worlds ruleset game.\n\nThe story takes place in LA in 2120, far into the future. The streets are filled with cybernetic gangsters, crime lords, hackers, and all sorts of filth. The party consists of our leader, a businessman who's venturing into seedier territory, his 'investor' (also a handler too, I suppose), a dominatrix tech gal, TechnoRambo (for all intents and purposes), and a few others who I can't aptly describe.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, in this game, you can pick hindrances to your character to affect their rolls, abilities, penalties, or how they act. As we are building our characters, I see that the two 'best' hindrances are: Confused (penalty to all Notice checks, and Knowledge checks), and Delusional (Visually and audibly delusional, a nutcase so to speak). So, seeing these two *amazing* hindrances, and knowing that our party is a little on the slow side when it comes to decision making, I decided to roll a wildcard.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWe have our established party, and we are all hired by our party leader to go into some seedier business. Our leader collects us all, and we're a pretty rag-tag group of people. TechnoRambo has a deathwish, our Dominatrix wants to steal cars and beat the shit out of people, and the others want money. That's where I come in. I am El Fenix del Oro, the Gold Phoenix. I am a man who is delusional and thinks he is a Mexican Luchadore, in 2120 AD Los Angeles. The party groans, asks me to reroll, but the DM allows it \"for playtesting purposes\".\n\nFast forward to our contact. We get hired by a crime boss to recover a Pulp Fiction-esque briefcase from the Armenian mafia. We steal some cars (after stealing the low-intelligence Luchador's money), to get to the MegaTower where our target has his base of operations. We make our way quietly to the fourth floor, and speak with some goons at the entrance to what seemed to be a shipping/warehouse floor. \n\n\"We are here to see Yuri. We have a proposition for him.\" our leader says, successfully rolling a charisma check to not get shot in the face by a bunch of Armenian goons. One of them grumbles and steps away to presumably speak with Yuri, or another person to arrange it. La Fenix has another idea, and bursts into a full sprint towards the man. I roll to hit, success. Rolling for damage, I critical twice. I body slam the goon, and pin him, breaking his arm and making him drop his weapon. The party groans as we all roll for initiative.\n\nCombat continues, with Fenix being at the top of the board, beating the ever loving shit out of this guy on the ground. He becomes mostly incapacitated, and one of his buddies tries to get closer to avoid gunfire (due to friendly fire penalties, my party can't shoot him without risking shooting me). On my turn, I see an opportunity for a show of strength. I roll to use the grappled Armenian as an improvised weapon against his friend. I miss. Armenian is still grappled and can't roll to do anything. Party gets ambushed by a huge Russian with an LMG who was hiding in a shipping container, so they all leave to deal with him on the other side of the warehouse. My turn comes again, and I roll to beat this man with another man. I hit, by one point. Roll for damage. **Critical.** Roll again. **Critical.** Roll a third time. **Critical.**. Last roll. No crit, high damage. I deal a total of 42 points of damage to both the Armenian and his grappled, shattered friend. They both die instantly. I beat a motherfucker with another motherfucker. Sadly, Combat ended before I could climb a shipping container and frog-press the other goon. We find the briefcase, and hastily attempt to escape this bustling MegaTower full of people with a blood-soaked Luchador in tow. Somehow we make it out without alerting anyone, and set up a meet with our Crime Boss Employer.\n\nNeedless to say, they left me tied up in our hideout until they came back.",

        "text": "This is my first post. On the whole of Reddit, so just stick with me.\n\nMy friends and I have known each other for several years. Some I know from real life and others I met online in roleplaying communities and just kinda stuck with them outside of those communities.\nSome of us play a Dark Heresy campaign and enjoy it, but decided we wanted a more high risk/mortality game to go along with it so decided on an Only War game. All based in the same Universe as the other, the actions of one group affects what happens in the other. It's pretty cool, and our GM is amazing since our DH was his first attempt at running a game at all.\n\nOur Regiment is from an Oceanic Industrial World (Think Vostroya meets Kamino) that has strong ties with the Adeptus Mechanicus, as it has the ability to produce Skimmer Vehicles. Our Regiment is actually a Planetary Defence Force used against the Large amount of insurgents on the planet from an incursion of Chaos Space Marines years before. The Regiment is made up of mostly Gangers from any Hive Cities or Hab blocks and Tribes people who are basically Stereotypical Rednecks like Cletus from the Simpsons. You're sent there as either punishment or because you aren't useful to the world in any way apart from being a meat shield. Light infantry and Scavenger tactics are important to their success and are run by a Colonel who is ex-Imperial Guard, training up the new Recruits for the Planets Tithes, and also uses this to train up Auxiliary forces such as Abhumans by calling in favours.\nThey are the 495th Aquaticus 'Ceremite Kelpies', born to defend their Homeworld from the powers of Chaos they know so much about to honour both the Emperor and the Omnissiah (They aren't Tech Priests, they don't understand the full difference and similarity).\n\nWe rolled up a few characters, always having a back-up just in case.\nOur Squad is made up of currently:- \n\n* **Sergeant Bellis** - Our NPC NCO for the current moment. He uses the standard Guardsman stats and is a massive prick to the squad. Not really apart of the squad but is assigned to looking after us by the Colonel himself. Assigns us all nicknames. Nicknamed 'Bellend'.\n\n* **Corporal Danlin** - My character of the Sergeant(Squad Leader) Class. Ex-Ganger who is loyal to the Squad and the reason it's called Fireteam Blobfish. Nicknamed 'Scum'\n\n* **Private First Class Rye** - The Squad's Medic and resident Hillbilly. His previous medical experience was all preformed on Grox's. He's very Backwater and only wants to talk about Cheese. Nicknamed 'Tubs'\n\n* **Private First Class Izzy** - Our BFO - Big Friendly Ogryn. Exactly how an Ogryn is supposed to be is very dumb but strong as hell. He doesn't like the thought of killing people so we tell him his gun puts people to sleep. He daydreams a lot. He's nicknamed 'Big 'Un'\n\n* **Private Rachell** - Squad's Heavy Weapons Specialist. She is detached from the rest of the squad but is pretty badass with her Aquaticus Pattern Lascannon she can lift on her own. Nicknamed 'Fireguard'\n\n* **Private Eli** - Squad's Operator and Combat Engineer. Another backwater guy, didn'tt even know what cheese was and fights with Rye about the strange swamp legends both their cultures have. No nickname as of yet\n\n* **Private Klaus** - Squad's Little Pikey. A Ratling who is loud, proud and very fun to be around. Can't help but have a laugh and is very good with his sniper. Sadly though, he's a bit squishy. Nicknamed 'Mutant'.\n\nSo, I'll leave out the first mission as it was an introduction for us and the GM to the new system. However, I'll write up the newer stories as we finish them\n\nEdit: Realized I forgot to mention this, we're not using Comrades.",

        "text": "I've been running various games for about two years now and had been playing with my 17 years old sisters for about a year of that. But the rest of my family had never played with me before, so it surprised me when my Dad asked me to run a family DnD game when I was home for Christmas break. I agreed, and started rolling up characters with my family members. My 7 year old sisters took to it with gusto and started getting really excited about playing, so my dad suggested I run a game with just them to get them accustomed to the rules before the rest oft he family joined.\n\nSo I ran a short intro game with just my 7 year old sisters. One was a gnome druid who liked talking to animals and the other was a plain human fighter because she wanted to be a \"sword girl\". They were hired to investigate some missing cows, just a nice easy mission for a couple first time adventurers. They checked out the farms the cows had disappeared from from, found some tracks and other clues, and the druid had a conversation with with some of the cows that hadn't been taken. The eventually determined that some goblins had been behind the thefts. So they set a trap and caught the goblins as they tried to steal another cow. \n\nUpon examining the goblins, my sisters determined they looked very skinny and were probably hungry. So they shared some food with their captives. THey then convinced the goblins to show them the goblins home, and when they wee shown it they found that the goblins all had families and were taking the cows for milk. So instead of killing or driving off the goblins, they decided they wanted to get the goblins jobs. They went around to all the farms the goblins had robbed and made them apologize and return the cows then tried to get them jobs as farm hands at all the farms. Finally they found someone willing to accept the goblins as hired help and left the goblins at his farm where they moved their families in and worked hard in return for a dry place to sleep, food, and a little bit of gold. The whole time, the thought of killing the goblins never even crossed their minds. \n\nIt was the cutest game of DnD I have ever played. I can't quite shake all my evil DM tendencies though, so today they will be up against a few zombies. Let them try to get those guys jobs. ",

I'm always a little surprised to get the little orange envelope notification on reddit, and even more surprised when it's related to something I've written out for fun.\n\nThe finale has been waiting to be written out, and I've been dreading posting it. I usually live my life by trying not to be a dick, and this is one of the more shameful moments of my DMing career. But it is said that the show must go on, the internet provides anonymity, who cares what they think, etc.\n\nWithout further ado, and as promised in the comments of the last installment - the dick comes out.\n\nPlayer and Atonalxotl have come to a truce based on mutual respect and admiration... Well, he admires what she can do for him in the future, and she respects that - despite the lack of evil competence she has witnessed - Player is capable of threatening her people and their territory.\n\nAfter gathering his wits, Player sets off with the guidance of his elven companion, and they make their way back towards the city from which he came. Despite his history, he seems to think that he can begin sowing the seeds of chaos and rebellion among the citizens (none of whom he has given reason to like him) under the noses of the Paladins.\n\n**Dick DM emerges in force ahead!**\n\nOn the way back home, Player and Atonalxotl pass a rather large clearing, tucked away between the forest border, nearby mountains, and hills that will eventually run into the plains that will eventually lead to his destination. In the clearing is a small castle.\n\nPlayer thinks this will make a good point from which he may begin gathering power.\n\nThe quirky druid who lived there thought the same thing.\n\nInitially, I had planned on this being a potential ally against the Paladins - this druid representing the chaotic and sometimes destructive side of nature and the constant struggle of the natural world to retake the land inhabited by civilizations. He also had a particular affinity for dinosaurs, because they were so rarely encountered, and he wanted to see more freedom for nature, blah blah blah.\n\nLike I said, quirky.\n\nPlayer didn't really like the idea of recon, despite heaps of evidence (both in real life and in game) that it might be helpful. Instead of, say, observing from afar, or announcing his presence peacefully to see what was up, he begins charging towards the front door. Apparently, he didn't want to give anything time to run out and ambush him from the trees.\n\nThe druid - being paranoid - had set up some magical defenses to ward off intruders. Mostly simple things, such as an alarm system. Upon tripping the alarm, Player was hailed from the top of the castle tower by said druid, who gave him one opportunity to explain himself.\n\nPlayer said he was going to claim the castle as his fortress before waging war on the paladins, and that the man could join him or die. Not the best first impression.\n\nDruid took offense to this, used some spontaneous casting to summon a pair of Tyrannosaurs, then sat back to observe.\n\nContinuing with his traditional mode of attack (poisoning his weapons, running in, then flailing wildly), Player was quickly swallowed whole. Then he cut his way out. This happened no less than three times, maybe more, before Atonalxotl was able to down one of them, grab him, and flee to the tree line for safety. The druid, angered that one of his pet Tyrannosaurs had been slain, cast summon nature's ally a few more times, producing some megaraptors to hound them through the trees.\n\nPlayer and his elf companion debated on what to do for a while, before settling on a new plan. Atonalxotl, with her levels in monk, was pretty quick. She also had access to Abundant Step.\n\nShe grabbed Player's grappling hook and rope, sprinted across the clearing to the castle wall, and made her way up the side. At this point, the remaining Tyrannosaurus had expired, and the Megaraptors began to sniff Player out.\n\nShe found the highest place she could (while still allowing the rope to reach the ground), slow fell down the wall, sprinted back. The megaraptors were nearly on Player.\n\nOne abundant step later, Player was at the rope, and quickly began climbing, clearing the range of the megaraptors just as they reached the wall. They were in.\n\nThe pair fought pretty well after getting inside, cutting through a number of summoned allies, before it seemed that druid had run out of minions.\n\nThey finally reach the top of the tower, expecting an epic confrontation and a battle that would be told of throughout the ages. What they got instead was an unassuming cat, which meowed at their arrival and hid beneath a chair.\n\nPlayer - in a moment of supreme oversight - decides to try and pick up the cat, thinking he might use it as a bargaining tool when the druid reappeared. What he was not expecting was the *finger of death* that the wildshaped druid cast on him.\n\nSaving throw failed. Blackguard||Assassin dies. Adventure over.\n\nThe Dick strikes the killing blow at last...\n\n**The End**",

A half-elf bard (Alòuna) with a penchant for seduction, a human monk (Khan) with a heart of gold, an undine ummoner (forget name) obsessed with narwhals, a human druid (Yolm) who searches for the secrets of the Cult of the Mammoth, a hobgoblin barbarian (forget name) who fights for only his own glory, and a half-elf cleric (forget name) who preaches of the end of the world were the unlikely group that formed to discovery the secret of the disappearance of Menas Absalom, the main brewer of the city.\n\nMenas had been missing for two days, so the intrepid party asked his main rival, Imperia Wintrish, about his whereabouts. After being led to a warehouse on the coast, our heroes were attacked by a ferocious Leopard that was nearly felled by the hobgoblin, but at the last second was rescued by the druid Yolm and made it his animal companion. Through searching the warehouse and interrogating the man in charge of it, the party discovered that Imperia Wintrish was looking to cover up all traces of Menas' disappearance.\n\nOn their way to confront Imperia, multiple party members had... adventures. The summoner discovered a whistle that could summon his own personal hobo butler, who he proceeded to dress up like a narwhal. The bard Alòuna managed to gather the attention of a guard, and stripped him of his... information. And finally, the monk carried the unconcious body of the man guarding the warehouse.\nThe party confronted Imperia, but were made to do battle with a mysterious masked assassin, who proved to be no match for their combined might, and broke his leg jumping out the window to escape before being killed by Alòuna, though not before revealing the existence of a Brotherhood of Assassins.\n\nMeanwhile, the Leopard sat on Imperia while Khan interrogated her and found out the location of Menas. Unfortunately Menas was dead, and after bringing this information to the his Butler, affairs were tended to, and the party went to relax and gather information, in which the Summoner heard the tale of the Five Ancient Narwhal Stones, which could be used to summon a space narwhal. Also, the Hobgoblin lost a bar fight with a 7'6\" woman who threw him through the window.\n\nThe party is now at a standstill. They have yet to recover their reward for the retrieval of Menas, and also have heard of the mysterious Brotherhood of Assassins.\n\nWhat will they do next? Will the DM do a better job of the write-up of the next adventure? Will the summoner find the Ancient Narwhal Stones? Will Alòuna contract syphilis? Find out in our next adventure!",

Besides being completely wireless (so the government couldn't hijack her precious brain waves), she also instantly accused anyone she met of being a \"government agent\".\n\nOur mission was to take out a ~~government agency~~ gang that was targeting Orks and Trolls in the local government. We didn't know they were targeting goblinized people, just \"deal with the gang\".\n\nWe came into a small skirmish with a group of them, and managed to take one alive... by Twitch flying kicking him off of his motorcycle. Our Dwarf rigger called it \"The most metal thing he's ever seen.\"\n\nWe take him back to Twitch's safehouse (it's the safest. Lined with tinfoil and everything) to interrogate him. While all the other characters are mucking around trying to work out the best way to approach this, Twitch slaps him awake.\n\n\"ARE YOU A GOVERNMENT AGENT!?!?!?\"\n\nThe other players lose their shit, worried that I have now ruined our chances of interrogating this ganger.

I was just... huh?\"\n\nRepeat for about 4 times before he finally screams \"I'M NOT WITH THE GOVERNMENT!

She takes the unconscious ganger's commlink and calls random contacts, accusing them of being government agents, until she finally stumbles across the leader of the gang, who tells her they have a \"trog fighting pit\" in their base. He also gives Twitch the captured ganger's name, which she then uses later as a part of her disguise.\n\nTwitch is the best accidental interrogator ever.",

The two surviving characters are now on the deck of a knackered Chilean fishing boat, contemplating how the millenary city of R'Lyeh rises from the seas. The gargantuan outline of Cthulhu can be seen against the horizon, rising from its tomb like a walking mountain range.\n\nThe players are completely silent, coming to the conclusion that they have messed up along the way and none of this should really be happening. The sun rises behind them, revealing the Old One in all its terrifying glory. The unholy city is also revealed to them. Out of their minds, the fishermen jump over board and try the impossible swim to an Easter Island that can barely be seen in the distance, thus plunging to their deaths.\n\nWith almost the certainty that their characters are now paper bin material, I cue the players to roll the old 1D10/1D100 sanity check.\nPlayer one rolls SAN, succeeds. Rolls 1D10, getting a 3. A bit shocked after witnessing what in effect is the beginning of the end of the world, the battle-hardened WWI veteran lights up a cigarette and pretends to admire the view. A bit miffed, I tell player two to roll for SAN. Catastrophic failure. Time to roll 1D100 and see his character go to waste. \n\n... 01. Fucking 01. We all stare at the dice but there is no way it is not a 01.\n\nSensing my evident surprise and slight irritation, the gentle and eccentric librarian played by player two leans against the railing of the deck and shouts at the gigantic Old One \"Hey fucker, you almost had me startled for a second there!\"\n\nNow that the atmosphere is thoroughly ruined, I go with the flow and turn the remainder of the game session into a heroic and silly pulp-like adventure. In my mercy, and just for the giggles, I allow them to bravely send R'Lyeh back to the depths whence it came and survive to tell the story.\n\nOnce the session is done, my buddies give me the cocky look, sensing my irritation at having a decent terror campaign turned into a clown festival. I give them a solemn look and I tell them: \"From this day forward both your characters suffer horrible night terrors and are essentially incapable to sleep anymore. Soon afterwards, they are committed to separate insane asylums, where they will live the remainder of their short and shattered lives.\"\n\nWe look at each other in silence for a while, until player two shrugs and says, looking to player one \"It IS only fair\". \n\nPlayers one, three and four nod in agreement. Characters one and two are immediately discarded and inducted into our hall of fame, where they remain to this day. They even got to cameo as insane NPCs years later.\n\nAh, the memories, bros.\n\n**Disclaimer: ENG not the mother tongue. First post in sub.**",

The Festival of Lastlight, the celebration marking the end of the year, was due to begin that night. Velros was abuzz with preparations as lights were hung, ale brewed, food cooked, and fires lit. We, however, were not staying in town for the festival. We had been called, and Tar-Hal was insistent--we must meet up with Grayson as soon as possible.\n\nWhile he drove the cart through the town, the rest of us sat in the back. Avi was working on her song, Tungdill was reading up on mindflayers, Krom was petting his psuedodragon. Lyria appeared to be reading her spellbook. And I was putting the finishing touches on a plan. An evil, devious plan. \n\nI reached over, and nudged Lyria. \"Hey Liara,\" I asked, \"can I borrow your spellbook?\"\n\nShe looked up with a look of concern. \"Why do you need to use my spellbook?\"\n\n\"Well, don't all good Wizzymen learn spells from spellbooks? I want to learn a spell!\"\n\n\"That's true, but they learn them by writing them down in their spellbooks. And you don't have one.\"\n\n\"But I can start one! Can't I borrow yours?\"\n\n\"I just...I don't think you need it,\" she sighed. \n\n\"Not even for five minutes?\" I pleaded.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Four?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Three? Two-and-a-half!\"\n\n\"Fine! One minute! Only one, and I'll be counting and watching.\" With some reluctance, she handed over her spellbook. I happily took it, and began to rifling through it. I wasn't disappointed, it was very clearly a spellbook! Page after page of runes and arcane marks. \n\n\"Wow! Look at this!\" I showed Lyria the page I had just turned to. Happily, I then closed the book and exclaimed: \"I can't read this shit!\" \n\nThen I threw the book into the air.\n\nLyria screamed, and jumped at me. But she couldn't stop me from tossing the book into the air. I extended my arm into the air, hand open.\n\n\"Now watch this! BURNING HANDS!\"\n\nA jet of flame engulfed the book, incinerating it. Ash rained down. Lyria's response was immediate.\n\nShe blasted me with elemental damage. I went down, unconscious. When I came to, Tar-Hal was staring at me. I had been handcuffed, and Lyria was staring at me with a look of pure loathing. Of course, I immediately began to laugh. Oh, how I laughed. Krom and Avi were fighting back laughter too, but most of the party was fairly stone-faced.\n\nLyria yelled at me, her voice contorted with rage. \"Where's my book? Do you even realize what the fuck you just did?\"\n\nThis, of course, only made me laugh harder. Lyria could barely contain her rage. \n\n\"Unlock the handcuff! Then I'll give you the book back,\" I said through my giggling. The smile on my face was wide, though my clothing was scorched from the elemental blast.\n\nAgainst Lyria's wishes, Tar-Hal unhandcuffed me. I reached up, took off my hat, and pulled her spellbook out of it. I gave it to her, then loudly yelled \"WIZZYMAN!\" while sparks flew out of my fingers. The look on her face was utterly blank, probably somewhere between 'I want to murder this fucker' and 'Why didn't I murder this fucker'. Tar-Hal immediately punched me in the face, and I collapsed, unconscious, to the floor.\n\nIn the end, I was not slaughtered. Nor was I beaten to death. Lyria is, not unfairly, refusing to speak to me. However, it was all worth it.",

        "text": "Trolls! Trolls are lovely to troll with! Here is how to make the DM tear out his/her hair! I planned out the following questions to experimentally test when we managed to subdue a troll in a pit trap.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. What is the smallest part of a troll that can grow into a new troll.\n\n2. What happens when someone/something eats troll meat? Chestburster troll? Acid nullifies the growth and it digests normally?\n\nIn my case, after subduing our troll the answers were- fingers and toes are the smallest part that regenerates and that stomach acid digests troll bits, respectively.\n\nThis meant that I couldn't actually use troll toes as a badass and hilarious poison to kill giant monsters. The DM guessed my goal. Or so he thought. Always have a scheme for every outcome!\n\nThis basically provides infinite rations if you are willing to eat troll. Just slice off whatever section regrew recently and never leave your rations sitting for too long. Bonus from the chaos this causes if the party is ever incapacitated for some reason. There is a ticking time bomb of angry hungry troll slowly maturing in the saddlebags.\n\nYou can basically get 5 toes every time a foot regrows. This means every few days your stock of budding trolls Is multiplied by five. (Even if the DM says it has to fully regenerate into a new troll before re-splitting, you can still leave the troll in a pit and slice off fingers and toes as fast as they regrow them. This of course led to...\n\nThe game breaking result- my exponential troll splitting world conquest schemes. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScheme 1- bury tiny boxes containing hundreds of troll fingers/toes in major locations around a hostile kingdom, then charge a ransom to reveal the location.\n\nSadly, I was overruled by the party saying that either \n\nA: The kingdom would probably call in some sort of commando team of spellcasters to rip the information from the minds of our quickly cooling corpses.\n\nB: Someone would find out about our trick, the story would spread, copycat plans would be executed by other ambitious parties with questionable morality, and soon the party would be responsible for a troll apocalypse. \n\nScheme 2: Bombard a city during a siege with troll toes launched from a catapult. Even if the vast majority were destroyed at least some would land on rooftops, in sewers, and in out of the way back alleys. The end the result would be hundred of rampaging troll destroying the city from inside. In a reluctant attempt to get the stodgy moral members of the party onboard I suggested we sell this as a military technology to a somewhat ethical government which we liked.\n\nSadly the copycat issue reared its ugly head again, except instead of random entrepreneurs (criminals) being the copycats we would start a cold war between countries where the missile gap was replaced with a race to build ungodly huge toe launchers on the borders of kingdoms in order to instantly scatter troll toes across swaths of the countryside as soon as the kingdom was attacked. My party were a bunch of alarmists! All these consequences and stuff. It would have taken years to get to this point! Decades even! Priorities...\n\nAt this point DM fiat kicked in and the troll toes were ret-conned. As a bribe to get me to never do this again I was given a bag of troll toes which replenished themselves and acted as an incredibly nauseating bag of infinite rations for the truly desperate.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI (wisely) took what I could get, but I still remember my beautiful troll induced apocalypse that could have brought kingdoms to their knees and let me roll in chests of gold for the decade it took for the consequences to reach whatever bolt hole I found.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

        "text": "For a bit of context, we're all relatively new for DnD, and this is our first ever campaign in 5E. Our DM is also DMing for the first time, and is so far doing a bang-up job. But he forgot one thing: players like killing things that try to kill them.\n\nSo our party consists of:   \n\nThe Commander - Likely the most level headed, a Tiefling fighter with the battle commander trait. Wields a longsword and a shortsword in battle, and generally chaotic good.   \n\nThe Pirate: A human pirate raider (fighter) looking for some adventure and a fight, and maybe a bit of redemption. Certainly chaotic, but morality is dubious.   \n\nThe Monk: An Elf monk who's more of a handyman who's getting into adventuring, and helps provide comic relief to the group. Pretty neutral overall.\n\nThe Wizard: Another tiefling with a potential past with The Commander. A very chaotic spellcaster with a dubious hold on morality.  \n\nThe Paladin: Lawful good, and tries to act as the morals of the group, but often starts the combat. ^^Trying ^^to ^^be ^^unbiased ^^here, ^^it's ^^me.   \n\nTo cut a very long story short, the \"peaceful\" village's magic field preventing their surroundings attacking them, including a particularly strange mindflayer. The party had met with the mindflayer before, and he paralysed half the party before fleeing, barely taking a scratch.   \nThe village was evacuated after the field was disabled by the party, for a good reason that involved human torture and sacrifice. As midnight passes, the field drops for the first time in many a year, and quite soon, the mindflayer moves in looking for minds to flay and other strange intentions that no-one's quite sure of.   \nNature seems to be angry with the party, and suddenly about 8 boars attack the house that the party has holed up in. Most of the party stands by the front door, whilst the wizard stands on a balcony, ready to rain down hellfire. Which he did.   \n\nOur wizard casts a fireball spell, happy to use his first explosion of the day. All 8 boars, charging in the pack, are immediately charred and killed. At this point, our DM seems a bit annoyed at how easy it was for us.  \n\nRound two: Immediately afterwards, seven brown bears charge. Getting restless, as well as confused as to the sudden charge of more bears than they've ever seen, our melee heroes prepare for a battle. The Paladin makes a javelin throw that would make Achilles cry, and the Wizard deals constant damage from high ground with Scorching Rays. As the bears approach, now scorched and a few speared, the Pirate charges, breaking the line. Despite how stupid the move was, the party is used to it. Through sheer luck and quite some skill, the Pirate manages to hold the bears at bay, holding off three at a time whilst somehow not taking any damage. The Paladin makes his halberd do the glowy but holds the line, and the Commander considers his options, calling out attacks whilst moving about. The Monk, always happy to help, rushes in and starts using magic to damage the bears. Bears are focused on the Pirate, a few moving around in the back, but the Commander joins the fray and with the help of the monk wears down the force. A well placed shatter spell from the wizard weakens the pack, and the Paladin helps move in to finish them off. All around, the only hit taken was by the Commander, who parries it to take a whole 1 damage.   \n\nAs expected and intended, the mindflayer shows himself from nowhere, obviously enraged and deranged by how easily his minions were dispatched. He holds an NPC from earlier, and begins to take his brain in front of everyone else. The Paladin doesn't let this slide, and throws one of his few remaining javelins, striking the mindflayer in the chest. Amazed at the gall of him, the mindflayer begins to flay his mind; he didn't take into account the fact that paladins are proficient in intelligence saves. The mindflayer, getting even more angered unleashes a psionic blast of some sort, stunning most of the party and nearly downing the Wizard already. The monk remains standing, and here he shines.   \n\nHe sprints in and places four attacks in rapid succession. All hit and hit hard, the mindflayer is amazed as well as wounded. The Paladin recovers and charges, and swings with divine smite onto the tentacle-face. The halberd swings through his head and the radiance burns him, and he falls down dead.  \n\nAt this point the DM is angry. Apparently, we just pulled a three-quarter Henderson. We killed his BBEG who he intended to plane-shift out but we killed too quickly. His plot has suddenly been mostly derailed, and his schemes undone, and all of it with relatively little effort from the PCs. We didn't know this, and we're taken aback. We take the relatively huge amount of XP for killing a Mindflayer Arcanist by 5th level characters, pat ourselves on the back and revel in the fact we proved our DM did a stupid.\n\nTL;DR: Players killed a guy they had a grudge against with little effort, ended up killing the planned BBEG and completely derailing the DMs intended plot. \n\nThanks for reading, half for catharsis since we ended up laughing for a good few minutes at the DM, who laughed at himself as well.",

        "text": "Started my first pen and paper RPG with some old highschool buddies.\n\n\n40k Deathwatch, then 40k BlackCrusade, then 40k Only War.\n\n\nI'm getting more and more familiar and enthralled with Warhammer lore, and have met many amazing NPCs in campaigns, several of whom were commissars (insane war-general looking dudes that shoot a lot of their own folks to keep order.)\n\n\nAt the time of starting Only war, I had the highest player-kill count in our group. Not proud of this, it just happens a lot (played a Khorne berserker in BC.)\n\n\nGm wanted us to start a campaign playing tank squad piloting one of the smaller tanks (don't remember the name.) So, I created Commissar Connie Saur. I was to ride atop the tank in the open hatch, acting as tank commander. \n\nWe were to travel around with a column of 15 other tanks, through a small town, and over a hill to kill a bunch of orcs on the other side in a forest. \n\n\nOn our way through the town, a lone panicking sniper round (I know orcs don't have snipers) kills one of the sergeants with his head out the top of one of the other tanks. Immediately, all the other tank commanders dropped through their hatches and stopped. \n\nCommissar Connie Saur jumped out, stood on top of the autocannon at the top of the tank, and started firing his bolt pistol all over the fucking place.\n\nSniper takes a shot at me, just misses. Gm gives me a roll to sense what direction it came from. \n\nFailed the roll.\n\nFires bolt pistol around some more.\n\nGets shot at again.\n \nThis time it rips into my left shoulder, and I roll for a solid read that the shot came from the clock tower dead ahead. \n\n\nCommissar Connie Saur yells down at his comrades to fire everything at that big fucking ugly clock tower at the end of the street.\n\nTank aims and blows it up.\n\nSuccess. \n\nOther tanks panic and start blowing up every building in the small town, killing and panicking hundreds of cowering civilians. \n\nIn the name of the Emperor. \n\n\nAfter that was over, we drove up the hill and sat there with three other thanks at the top, while the rest of the tanks ran down and blew the ever-living fuck out of the orcs in the forest. \n\nThump\n*Thump*\n*THUMP*\n\nOut of the forest comes an orc stompa. (Huuuuuuge ramshackle orc mech)\n\nStarts killing all tanks down the hill. \n\n\nThe two tanks next to us turn around and start flooring it toward the town on the other side. \n\n\nCommissar Connie Saur is not pleased. Convinces (with a bolt pistol) his gunner to aim at the fleeing tanks with the main cannon..\n\n\nFires.\nReloads.\nFires. \n\n\nTwo dead tanks.\n\nStompa just finishes killing entire squadron of tanks down the hill. \n\nTurns toward us.\n\n\nCommissar Connie Saur climbs back on top of the autocannon, and starts firing his bolt pistol at the stompa while screaming at the driver to charge it.\n\n\nThrough some very clutch and real rolls, the stompa misses our tank twice, blowing the top of the hill off behind us. \n\n\nOur sniper gaurdsman on the main cannon manages to put 4 rounds into the stompa's GIANT dakka arm.\n\n We put every round of every gun we had into that arm, and managed to dodge its cannon shots.\n\n\nDisables it.\n\n\nBut its \"little\" guns destroy our treads.\n\n\n\nGet a call from HQ that they had just received word of a stompa in our area, and to pull back, that we are leaving the sector and calling for exterminatus (planet glassing.)\n\n\n\nCommissar Connie Saur calls the commander at HQ a gutless yellow bellied coward.\n\n\nTeam asks me what we should do now.\n\n\nI tell them to equip bayonets and charge.\n\n\nTotal team kill. No one is mad. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hello gamefans! So I was recently directed to the existence of this sub, and boy do I have some tales I'd love to share. I am currently a player in a long-running V20 Vampire: The Masquerade campaign, and though it is actually my first RPG ever, the ridiculousness and dramaness and awesomeness has gotten me tabletop-addicted for life. \n\nWe audio-record all of our sessions, which has lead to me painstakingly transcribing and novelization-izing each episode and hosting them on a blog, which has been excellent writing practice for me and excellent entertainment for everyone else. But, I've learned, the blog has its downsides; the anecdote I am about to share has become so legendary that real-life friends who are in no way involved with the game have started teasing me about it.\n\nThis incident occurred on California's Farallone Islands, which had been secretly taken over by Nazi Tremere running an illegal gargoyle production facility (you know, as you do). If that wasn't bad enough, at this time we were *also* trying to escape an arch-powerful half-demonic Lasombra Methusula who was rolling through the facility destroying everything in his path (you know, as you do). \n\nI play Tom, a Brujah of high strength and low patience, and at this point I was escaping with player-character Paul, a Silicon Valley Toreador entrepreneur, and our NPC-ally Sophia, a teenage Glasswalker (yes I know. long story). We also had a couple gargoyles Paul dragooned into his service and one useless Tremere ghoul named Bob.\n\nAnyway, so the Methusula was chasing us and we bolted deep into the bowels of the island, eventually stumbling into a room filled with an ancient, dusty mainframe. Paul and Sophia immediately started pouring over it, figuring out a way to use her werewolf magics to G-us-the-F-O. I, meanwhile, having nothing to kill at the moment, decided to occupy myself by playing around with my sword, one which I had recently discovered and *appeared* to be enchanted to change state depending on what it was battling. I wasn't sure, though, so I decided to try a couple experiments.\n\n[As this short audio clip should tell you, though, my scientific protocol was somewhat lacking.](http://raptor.zombox.org/vampire_recordings/2014_07_10_sword_computer.mp3)",

        "text": "This is the first installment of what might become a semi-regular short post. I figured I'd share this bit, because I'm still slightly in awe of how this turned out.\n\nI'm working with a brand new group, and we're tinkering around with the semi-new Star Wars: Edge of the Empire game from Fantasy Flight. We're having fun with it, it's an interesting system, and I'm taking them through the book's sample adventure so we can all learn the mechanics.\n\nThe adventure itself is designed to push the PCs into moving through town to the local cantina, where the next plot hooks are buried. On the way, though, it gives a few minor random encounter-type diversions. Nothing important whatsoever, just minor brushes with the kind of rogueish townsfolk that populate this particular Outer Rim craphole.\n\nFirst, they get approached at the spaceport by a stuttering Rodian. The guy mistakes them for the smugglers he's supposed to be approaching, gets close, then tries to back away. He's supposed to leave at this point... except the group's Wookiee grabs him by the tunic and hauls him off the ground, asking him what he's doing, except he has no translator so he merely succeeds in making the poor sap soil himself. The Rodian finally wriggles out of his shirt and bolts, leaving the Wookiee holding an empty shirt.\n\nI have to take a brief break to compose myself when the player, with a completely straight face, adds the shirt to his loot list.\n\nOnce we resume, they head out into town, tramping through the dry, unpleasant town on their way to the local cantina.\n\nOne more random encounter. They pass by a smuggler operation: someone pops their head out of a hidden tunnel, scans for the law, then a few guys come out of the tunnel with crates and head for a nearby speeder. They're meant to take no notice of the party nor to pick a fight with them.\n\nAs is, I'm afraid, becoming a pattern: the party takes an unhealthy interest in their smuggling activities and starts to bug them. The smugglers get belligerent, until finally a brief fight breaks out that ends with most of the smugglers bolting and a couple of them laid out on the ground stunned.\n\nThere's a commotion outside the alley. They hear people \"going about their business\" with haste and the kind of activity that suggests that a few members of the local Stormtrooper detachment are finally taking an interest in the gunfight. They try to break into the smuggler's tunnel but it's locked, so they grab the only crate that was left behind, steal the shirt off the stunned smuggler's back, and bolt.\n\nI frankly don't know what their thing is with shirts.\n\nAnyway, this wasn't the interesting part: just your fairly typical intro session with a new group.\n\nWhat I found, though, was that I was sitting on a conundrum. My players had just stolen a crate from some smugglers, without any one of us having any sort of clue what should be within. The crates are mentioned in one line of the book, with no indication of what they were sitting on.\n\nI chose to try something oddball, based on my fondness for the narrative system from another RPG some of you may have encountered: Houses of the Blooded. I'd allow the *players* to decide what they'd found, and work on a narrative structure from there. Their fates were in their own hands; if they'd ripped off a crate of exotic food or something, they'd probably just have a mildly annoyed Hutt giving them crap for a while. If they were sitting on a box of glitterstim, well, the regularly-planned adventure was going to have to go on hold because they probably wouldn't make it to the cantina before the first hit squad showed up.\n\nIn retrospect I don't know if this was the best idea I ever had or the worst. Each of them (in an order determined by a die roll) was given the right to select one more-or-less-unrestricted detail about the contents of the crate they'd 'happened across,' with the promise that things would progress from there.\n\nPlayer 1 (The Muscle): \"It's an ancient data core.\" (That's a much cooler idea than I would have had. So far so good.)\n\nPlayer 2 (The Face): \"That is being sought by the Empire, the Sith, and every Bounty Hunter from Kamino to Hoth.\" (Uh.)\n\nPlayer 3 (The Pilot): \"It's rumored that this datacore might contain coordinates to an undiscovered Rakata Temple.\"\n\nFor those not immersed in Star Wars lore, I'm pretty sure that they just signed their own death sentences. The Rakata are an ancient race, a Precursor-type society that was long gone even as of the Old Republic era. They made incredibly powerful weapons that fused technology with the Dark Side of the Force, and some of the old Rakata relics were dangerous on a level that makes the Death Star look like child's play.\n\nI'm curious to see if these guys manage to survive, but they seem pretty cool with whatever happens. Maybe in the next month or so, I'll have some crazy stories for you guys!",

        "text": "This is a recap of certain events (i.e. some of the most hilarious ones, even though it can be hard to choose in this case) from the *Vampire: the Masquerade* actual play podcast episode [Mark of the Hunter](http://www.fandible.com/vampire-the-masquerade-ep-1-mark-of-the-hunter-part-1-of-2/) from the Fandible gamers.\n\nThe group consists of five people: \n\n* **Angela** (who was the GM/Storyteller for this session - they all take turns behind the GM shield in their various campaigns).\n\n* **Billy** - playing a teenage Caitiff who bribed homeless vagrants with hamburgers in exchange for blood donations.\n\n* **David** - his character was a geeky Nosferatu whose annoying personality and grating voice was just as off-putting to people as his physical deformities.\n\n* **Daniel** - playing a stereotypical Ravnos small-time criminal who made a tidy living selling dodgy Rolexes and smartphones he'd \"found\" somewhere. (\"I've got Resources 2, I'm comfortably middle-class. Let's ~~make it rain~~ make it damp!\")\n\n* **Jésus** - his character was a Gangrel who specialised in tracking, outdoorsy stuff, and clawing people's faces off. (During the final boss battle, he managed to make a very impressive initial charge, which quickly turned less impressive when his claws got stuck in the enemy's body armor, doing zero damage.)\n\nThey called themselves the Incompetent Coterie, and that description is fairly accurate. They held down a miniscule patch of territory in New York City, and got embroiled in a dangerous mission for the local Prince when a (human) serial killer started imitating vampires by draining his victims of blood, thus raising the risk that someone would notice the *actual* vampires lurking in the New York alleys.\n\nDuring this exciting adventure, David's Nosferatu made good use of his supernatural abilities, allowing him to conceal his hideous exterior under an illusion. However, he'd decided that, due to his character's limited imagination, all his illusory disguises resembled the dour-faced visage of Edgar Allan Poe in some fashion. \n\n**SPOILERS:**\n\nAt the end of the scenario, the group had managed to track down the serial killer (who evidently had some power-ups of his own, making him a serious challenge for even a group of four supernatural monsters, however incompetent the monsters might be). After a brutal battle, they realized that a human NPC gotten caught in the fight - and they had no powers that would let them modify his memories, and weren't quite willing to murder the guy to keep him quiet about the gruesome spectacle he'd just witnessed (he *was* a somewhat useful ally). \n\nThankfully, one of them had the idea to convince him that the entire event had been a prank, an initiation ritual conducted by a local sorority who'd kidnapped him, sprinkled him with \"fake\" blood, and staged the entire thing for the LOLs. David, thinking he could make the story seem more believable, used his powers to disguise himself as a blond sorority girl in a Pi Kappa Pi outfit and walked over to the NPC, asking him if he'd seen her ear rings, etc.\n\nThe group universally agreed that this must clearly be one of the most terrifying sorority girls ever. \n\n...Until they remembered that David's character always made his disguises look like Edgar Allan Poe. \n\nHowever, they also decided that Edgar Allan Poe's clone, wearing a Poe Kappa Poe outfit and a blond wig, must be *even more terrifying* than they'd previously thought.",

The PCs work to track down Reginald so that justice can be meted out upon his head. They set about seizing his assets in the city, killing his known ghouls, etc.\n\nOutside the city was a warship. The PCs sent to the Venetian necromancers for aid, calling upon their prior agreement. The Venetians' answer, however, was going to be a long while coming. The warship, meanwhile, was owned by a French nobleman on his way to the Crusades and accompanied by a Ventrue and a trio of Tremere. \n\nThe Tremere seemed to know a bit about the city - particularly they were interested in the whereabouts of some of their distant kin who had last been in the area attempting to build a tower. It was argued that this tower was to secure a route to the Crusades that would have brought wealth and riches to the city, but bygones are bygones.    \nThe Triumvirate were hostile to the idea of the Tremere entering the city. Their Ventrue patron was understanding (diplomatic one might say), but after some trouble with another port allied to the Venetian moneylenders, he was more concerned that his other ships and investment sail through the Adriatic unmolested and thus he was blocking the city's port. It would be a small thing, he said, quickly done. And in recompense the city would enjoy his future goodwill and a small chest of riches in repayment.     \nThe Triumvirate were uneasy about this. Some of the city's vampires (Mirlinda, Jeton, and Jacob) were willing to ally with the Ventrue and accept his gold. But some (like the Triumvirate and Daniel) didn't trust this French vampire. \n\nFactionalism started to spring up in the city - Christian vs Jew, Catholic vs Orthodox, Clan vs Clan. \n\nThe French warship left the harbor-mouth after several other ships passed by in the Adriatic (the city had some fishermen who were sneaking past and using other nearby coves. The vampires of the city who wanted to ally with the Frenchman tried to keep in contact, sending messages overland to meet up with the Crusaders. The Triumvirate did their best to keep a lid on things.      \nThe Venetians finally sent aid - in the form of a cabal of Lasombra asssassins and necromancers (there was at least one Giovanni-Cappadocian among them) that took up residence in the city (Look! New NPCs! A source for future PCs?). The Triumvirate were mixed about this aid: while Obryn was intrigued in their shadow-power and skill as assassins and Livinia was interested in necromancy from an academic point of view, the outsiders as a whole didn't fit in very well in the city, largely keeping to themselves and surrounding themselves with a retinue of Venetian moneylenders, metalsmiths, and masons. \n\nA year passes in a few game sessions with folks largely working on personal projects and the city further dividing along factional lines. Word comes that the Frenchman (or at least his vampiric retinue) is returning to France to raise more levies and persuade more nobles to join the Crusade. The city is divided at this word. However, it seems that there is time to prepare as the retinue is traveling overland and slowly at that (vampires needing to be safe during the day and all). \n\nThe city goes into a frenzy of activity with a number of vampires looking to join or at least support the Crusader and the rest looking to either keep them away from the city (afraid of the Tremere and the growing influence of the Camarilla in the far West) or to at least maintain the status quo in the city. \n\nIt almost seems as if the city is tearing itself asunder in its competing goals, and the closer the Crusader gets, the more violent the outbursts between its vampires become. \n\nUntil... the Crusader is due any night now. The city is practically abuzz. Reginald, long blood bound and controlled, has somehow slipped away and vanished. There are men carrying weapons openly in the streets, gathering in clumps by night. It seems as if there may be a coup when the Crusader arrives and the Triumvirate is on edge. \n\nA large bacchanal and feast day is held in the city, to celebrate the impending arrival of the Crusader. The party winds into the night and the city's vampires come out to attend. Mirlinda has become a Camarilla ambassador and awaits the Crusader's arrival. But... he doesn't show.\n\nInstead, Obryn rides into town astride the back of a wolf the size of a large horse. Both he and the horse are covered in horrific barding and armor that wails with the cries of the damned (Vicissitude created bone plates with half-dead ghouls stretched over them). He rides up to the closest bonfire and lifts high the severed (but still 'living') heads of the Ventrue's Tremere advisers. He tosses the heads into the fire as the wolf he rides howls (and is answered by scores of howls from the hills outside the city). Obryn declares himself regent and swears eternal animosity against the Tremere and their Camarilla cloak.     \n\nThe city fractures. Half the city's vampires ally with Mirlinda and state their intention to join with the Camarilla. The others, afraid of Obryn and his wolves, swear fealty to him and his sister, Alyce. Livinia says that's she done with all of this and will sleep for the next century or so (\"until you lot sort this nonsense out\").     \nObryn and Alyce and their supporters put the other vampires onto a ship and tell them that while their old alliances still stand due to ages of shared blood and purpose, that on this matter they must stand apart. \n\nAnd so the game ended with the vampires who decided to join the Camarilla sailing off for France while a Tzimisce monster reigned over this Albanian port as a gateway to the Voivodes of the East.

        "text": "So, to prefix this adventure, my PC is a Level 24 High Elf specializing mainly in Stealth and Archery, but with some perks put into Heavy Armor for defense. Also important is that I've been putting ALL my increases in stats towards Stamina for holding more stuff, so I still had a cap of 100 health.\n\nI had just finished up the sidequest \"The Only Cure\" (the one where you get the Spellbreaker shield) when I came upon the strangest five-way NPC brawl I've ever seen (although I admit I only figured out it was a five-way fight after I checked the bodies).\n\nOn one side were the Forsworn, with three regular Forsworn, a Forsworn Looter, and a Forsworn Briarheart. The Looter, Briarheart, and one of the regular Forsworn  were fighting a Bandit and a Bandit Outlaw, while the other two regular Forsworn were fighting both a Bandit Chief and a BEAR that was right next to them.\n\nAnd then three Orc Hunters starting fighting the bear AND the Forsworn, RIGHT next to the Forsworn-Bandit fight. It was so close to each other that I'm pretty sure one of the Orcs aggro'd the Bandits, but I'll get to that in a second.\n\nAt that moment, I was witnessing this carnage from across a river (I was killing Mudcrabs for soul trapping at the time), so in the name of experience points, I pulled out an Orcish sword I looted earlier and decided to go to town on the Forsworn and bandits first.\n\nEasy enough. Killed the regular Bandit as the Forsworn killed the Bandit Outlaw, then I began taking the Forsworn down. Downed some Potions of Minor Healing during the fight, and all was good. Except as I moved forward to kill the last Forsworn, I got a huge chunk of health taken off.\n\nDrank a Potion of Healing, backed off, and then saw the last Forsworn get killed by the bear. Out of the three Orc Hunters fighting the bear, one was barely alive and still trying to kill it.\n\nRemember the bandit aggro, though? Mr. Bandit Chief then came out of nowhere and smacked the last Orc Hunter into the ground before a stray swipe from the bear killed him too.\n\nSo I'm left with this weakened bear to kill, thinking that this chaos is over. It's not. The bear limply fell to its side in the middle of its roar, and I hadn't swung yet. As the bear fell to its side, its corpse acted like a comical curtain drop as it then revealed to me TWO Giant Frostbite Spiders coming my way, with one having spit poison at the bear to kill it.\n\nI primed my bow to nail the first Giant Frostbite Spider, and as I shot at it, I saw its health bar was about one Fus Ro Dah away from dying. After I killed that one, I shot at the second Giant Frostbite Spider...who didn't move. Oh, it's already dead.\n\n...wait, it's dead? And the other one was injured gravely already? Then it hit me: before the Forsworn, Bandits, and Orcs aggro'd the Bear, that Bear singleclawedly killed one Giant Frostbite Spider and left the other one at ~5 health.\n\nTo recap: 5 Forsworn (3 regular, 1 Looter, 1 Briarheart) VS. 3 Bandits (1 regular, 1 Outlaw, 1 Chief) VS. 3 Orc Hunters VS. 1 bear VS. 2 Giant Frostbite Spiders\n\nHoly hell it was glorious. And I was just on my way to clear out some bandit camp for a sidequest!\n\nTL;DR: I got some soul trapping done thanks to some surprise volunteers.",

        "text": "Saving Asimov from Hades.  \n  \n  \nPreviously:  \n[Start at the beginning.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2csbp6/my_dd_35e_e6_planescape_game_xpost_rdnd/)  \n[Or the penultimate part](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2pd4nz/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_ten_dd_35e_e6/)  \n  \n  \n**Session 23 - Finale**  \n  \nSo the party meet up back at the shop which cleared a tidy profit of 2,000gp. Norril tells Ragnam about the Dwarven smith so he goes out to enquire and has his axe engraved with a rune that causes his axe to add thunder to it's strike (+1d6 sonic damage) and now allows him to throw his axe at a target. He can throw the axe, creating a Lightning Bolt (5d6 Electric, DC 18 for half) at a single target, the axe then reforms in his hand after 1 turn. So: Throw - Turn weaponless - Axe back.  \nThe party discuss the scroll and decide when Ragnam returns they will activate it, so they do.  \n  \nThey form a circle as Fortinbras reads the scroll and upon completion everything goes white, then they appear in a bright place that strains the eyes. I describe the scene as they look around. It is a wondrous, glittering fortress with windows made from gems set in silver and gold, walls of inlaid copper and ivory, and floors of beaten mithral. I can sense Norril's mind suddenly fly into a battle of \"how do I steal this\" vs \"I'll probably die if I steal this\".  \n[I describe an old man in the room with them, about 40 feet away, talking to a Steel Great Wyrm Dragon, seven canaries flutter about his head.](http://1d4chan.org/images/thumb/3/37/DragonAndCanaries.jpg/400px-DragonAndCanaries.jpg)  \nThe followers of Bahamut drop to a knee instantly, The rest of the party act with respect. The Dragon turns to speak, they recognise it's manner and eyes as the Archivist.  \n*\"We expected you, sooner, Heroes.\"*  \nThe old man, Bahamut (I believe everyone realised one by one by now.) walks toward them slowly. **\"I understand you were waylaid in the mortal realm, and encountered Yeenoghu's pawn, an impressive victory, likely worth the delay.\"**  \nNow, only Fortinbras and Kurask really spoke here, I think the party wanted them to have this moment. They thanked Bahamut and spoke about the Wand of Orcus, when Bahamut suggested it was safer in his care for the time being.  \n  \nKurask immediately went to give Bahamut the weapon, when the party objected as they believed it would kill anyone who touched it Kurask was undeterred. the Archvist, now in human from took the Wand of Orcus from him and when neither died Kurask simply said. \"I have faith.\" in response to the objections. The archivist left the room with the item and Bahamut offered Kurask his reward.  \n**\"I believe a weapon of power for the weapon of power is a fair trade.\"**  \nBahamut reached out and blessed Kurask's +1 Lance of Jousting, creating a Holy Avenger of Jousting.  \nIt is a Lance with all the properties of a Holy Avenger, except it can either be a Lance of Jousting, or swift action change to a Keen Longsword. It was overpowered, and it was earned.  \nBahamut turned to Fortinbras and handed him a ring, telling him he would know how to use it, when it was time to use it.  \nHe also granted Orngix (Kurask's Dragonnel Mount) a gem inlaid in it's armour, but Kurask didn't actually notice as he was busy writing down all the things his new sword could do.  \nHe then offered the party aid. **\"Seeing as you required the power of the Wand of Orcus to free Asimov and I have deprived you of that power I feel obliged to grant you an alternative. The Wand of Orcus can break Yurtrus's enchantment as Orcus was more powerful than Yurtrus, There are a handful of powers out there stronger than Yurtrus's status as a lesser deity. I am such a power. I will join you in your return to the Fleshslough. Be ready in 24 hours.\"**  \n  \nSo the party were a little taken aback by this, I don't think it was particularly expected because I avoid giving the party too much gold or loot... and it probably felt like christmas when I started raining powerful enchantments down on them last session and at the beginning of this one, so having a God join the party was appropriately epic... it wasn't just a case of DM gets to play a deity... not completely.  \n  \nSo once composure was regained some of the party returned to sigil to prepare, some remained with Bahamut to pray, meditate and ask questions. Norril asked Bahamut about how he attained divinity and was recited the story of Io, and told about how mortals have achieved godhood in some cases, but in appropriately obscure answers. Bahamut explained to Fortinbras how god's use pawns to effect the affairs of mortals. He is Bahamut's pawn and that is why he has found himself drawn to other pawns, such as Yeenoghu's Gnoll and Yurtrus's Dreggrot. Bahamut merely places him in positions to give him the opportunity to *take* another's pawn. He explains that the Archivist visited him and advised him that Fortinbras and his fellows could possibly locate the wand and destroy Tenebrous.  \nTHAT prompted another discussion, because when the party destroyed the skull bound to the wand of orcus and destroyed the skull they freed the paladin's spirit and destroyed Tenebrous - the undead shadow of Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead. Ensuring he could not re-enter the world of the living. That victory is worth enough that Bahamut is willing to help them personally.  \nBahamut explained that whilst he is a greater power than Yurtrus in his home plane, Yurtrus would be strong, and Bahamut would be weakened.  \n  \nTwenty four hours passed. Everyone was ready.  \nBahamut took those who stayed with him to a remote corner of Celestia, heavily warded and showed them a spring of water, he then summoned Charon, the boatman of the Styx and Bahamut explained that this pure water eventually circles round through the great wheel, to a point that connects to the waters of the Styx.  \n  \nThey travel and emerge in Hades a lot quicker than the last time they took the boat. As Bahamut approaches the Fleshslough, walking as an old man he shuts his eyes and wills his followers to him. Hundreds appear, at first the party members that were in Sigil and attending things. Then Dragonborn of all metallic shades, then Silverbrow humans (some of which Kurask recognises as his people), then Stonehunter Gnomes, Glimmerskin Halflings, many adventuring or warrior types with dragonblood in their veins come through.  \nFortinbras questions why no True Dragons have been summoned and Bahamut informs him that Mortals have more resistance to Hades' than Dragons do. Fortinbras thought about it and remembered Nidhogg and mentioned his name. Bahamut just nodded solemnly.  \nThe summoned adventurer's knew why they were here, they had a divine purpose etched into them and they came willingly, ready to serve. Bahamut turned to the walls of the fleshslough and threw out what I described as \"holy-fireballs\" with a flick of a hand, carving a path through the fleshslough walls, purifying the boils and tendrils the create a garden of pestilence and he led them to a clearing. A different place to where the party were before.  \n  \n***\"You have failed adventurer's, your friend's life is forfeit. That is not whom I commanded you to hand the wand to.\"*** A voice on the wind, Yurtrus's voice bellowed through the fog.  \nThe Party screamed cries of defiance and the fogs parted slightly, showing a gathering of Fiends. Demons. Devils. Yugoloths. Worshippers. Favours had been called in and servants rallied. The forces took this as sign to charge so they did.  \nBahamut's champions took the devilcharge as reason to countercharge, so they did. Bahamut himself strolled casually with his forces, Canaries fluttering about him.    \n  \nWe rolled initiative and I described the battle raging around them. I explained that these foes were focused on them, and about the field other small pockets of fighting developed.  \n  \nThe party were faced with 4 [Orc Plague Speakers](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PVgOPv29pJY/UaD-nYjYd2I/AAAAAAAANAU/JhHTBuB9Q0o/s1600/orc+plague+speaker.jpg), 4 [Arrow Demons](http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/45032/Arrow_Demon.jpg) and 4 [Mezzoloths](http://imageshack.com/handle_redirect.php?ser=29&amp;file=mezzoloth.jpg).  \n  \nThe party quickly recognised that archers hiding behind spearmen and clerics in plate are scary. Fighting erupted with Norril and Ragnam cutting their way through melee, Baha Abdur who has taken Barry the Sentient Survival Mule of Holding as an item familiar and adorned him in Mule Armour with a Metal Unicorn Horn attachment moved forward and flanked. Kurask flew and delivered devastating charges with his Holy Avenging Lance. Fortinbras fought tooth and claw alongside his Wyrmling companion. Stanley provided air support with eldritch blasts and drew arrowfire with his ranged attacks against him have miss-chance.   \n  \nBarry managed to crit on his first ever attack, running through a Mezzoloth horn first and leaving behind scattered limbs and red mist. Baha Abdur almost went down about four times, and whilst epic level magic got tossed around he could barely get a heal.  \n  \nIn the background Bahamut was fighting Yurtrus, Yurtrus looks like an Orc in black robes, no flesh showing except the bone white flesh of his hands. His flesh constantly sloughs off and regrows, maggots and worms fall from him as he moves. At first they fought hand to hand. Old man boxing versus plague orc martial arts. A demon tried to approach the conflict and was torn apart about 50ft away from the energy coming off the pair. Yurtrus slowly grew, moving slower but hitting harder as he gained in size, when he was huge the Canaries scattered from Bahamut and Bahamut changed into a Collosal+ Platinum Dragon. The gods then fought will spell, disease and dragonbreath.\n  \nWhen the party had wiped most the enemy a commander dropped from the sky and landed a lot like [this, a Nycaloth.](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070606192949/forgottenrealms/images/6/6d/Nycaloth.JPG) Fortinbras felt the urge to activate his ring and became an [Aspect of Bahamut](http://www.canonfire.com/wiki/images/8/86/Bahamut02.jpg) for the next 6 rounds. A canary landed on Orngix's head and whispered, Orngix's gem activated and he became a very young, golden dragon.  \nThe canaries landed at points about the conflict and transformed into the seven golden dragons of Bahamut. Borkadd the Claw, Kurya the Eye, Sonngrad the Wing, Gruemar the Voice, Marroshok the Tail, Troannaxia the Presence and Urgala the Fang. They proceeded to turn the tide of battle wherever they landed.  \n\nThe party fought off the remaining demons whilst Fortinbras and Kurask defeated the Nycaloth.  \n  \nAs the Nycoloth fell the party looked on to the god's battle. Yurtrus was huge, even larger than Bahamut now, Bahamut was flying in for a strafing breath, Yurtrus performed a move they had seen Dreggrot perform many times, Counter Charge. He took the breath and caught Bahamut's neck as he flew by, twisting him into a throw and slamming the Dragon-God into the ground, then he began to assault the deity whilst he was stunned.  \nthe floor shook twice, once when Bahamut fell, and once when a handful of the golden great wyrms landed next to the Party. They told the party to get on and no one argued.  \nNorril mounted Kurya the Eye and readied himself.  \nBaha Abdur mounted Borkadd the Claw, who picked up Barry in one Talon.  \nFortinbras (now back to Dragonborn form) mounted Sonngrad the Wing and Nero landed too.  \nRagnam climbed atop Marroshok the tail, and drank some ale.  \nKurask stayed on Orngix and readied a lance.  \n  \nThe Dragons circled the god and flew in formation, lining up their paths for maximum coverage.  \nNorril and Kurya went in first, Yurtrus raised a hand but in return took Golden Dragonfire all over his arm. Norril swung true with a critical strike from Merthuvial and took off a finger from the deity.  \nBaha and Borkadd went next, aiming for the deity's head, a faceful of dragonfire from Borkadd, Barry's horn struck true into Yurtrus's head and a Glaive-delivered shocking grasp from Baha.  \nFortinbras and Sonngrad flew past, Fortinbras summoned a spiritual claw that shattered against the god's skin, Sonngrad burned the deity with dragonfire and Nero blew cold breath.  \nRagnam threw lightning at the god, as Marroshok's flame covered Yurtrus's back.  \nKurask then delivered a high speed smiting charge, smiting evil as he plunged the holy avenger into the godsflesh, and orngix unleashed his breath into the wound.  \n  \nYurtrus exploded into millions of grubs, maggots, flies and roaches, showering down and covering Bahamut's fallen form. A few seconds later however Bahamut emerged, spewing cleansing breath into the swarm. Some of the creepy crawlers got away from the fire, and the party landed next to Bahamut.  \n  \nThe party gathered that whilst beaten and bloodied the plague god was not dead, Dreggrot was hard enough to kill after all.  \nBahamut surveyed the field, they had taken about 30% in casualties or deaths, the demons had been killed or fled. People gathered the dead and moved toward the Dragons. The Golden Dragons worked in unison to open a portal to Celestia, to recuperate the wounded and cremate the dead.  \n  \nBahamut looked bad, he was bloody, things crawled beneath his skin and he staggered. He moved to the ice fields and began to release the frozen. Eventually Asimov was found and released, muscles atrophied and mind erased by the styxian ice, he was brought back to Celestia to recover.  \n  \nIn Celestia Bahamut explained that his favours were for them to keep. His ring would transform Fortinbras into his avatar (1/week, 6 rounds), the weapon was fitting for the master of dragon riders, as Kurask was to restart the order. Orngix's gem could bring out the heritage of a Drakkensteed or Dragonnel and turn it into a true dragon if they were deemed worthy. It was up to Orngix and Kurask to find worthy paladins.  \n  \nThe adventurer's were given gold, enough for comforts of the mortal life... but not enough to allow them to become complacent. Ragnam asked for more and Bahamut laughed him away. **\"Your gold-lust is admirable, master Dwarf\"**  \n  \nThe players now have 1 last task, a year will pass, and that year will be our epilogue, until such time these heroes are called to battle again some time in the future.  \n  \nSo for now; The End",

Chalking it up to the wild-magic zones in Pandemonium and being a little annoyed about it because black dragons are chromatic scum; the party gets moving, following the towns-folk's directions and keeping alert for things in the woods. They reach the town in a few hours, they are welcomed with food and ale as heroes for saving the townsfolk. They partake a little and are able to secure horses and a wagon for a fraction of it's value due to their need and status. Fortinbras mourns his previous horse which was unfortunately blended into a [gore-nado](http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/25jdzm/35e_story_the_battle_of_the_cathedral/) last year. The party hear of troubles around the lands they mean to travel through, gnoll bandits, getting more and more cunning and vicious; attacking merchants, travellers and anyone else on the roads without prejudice. The party decide to travel along the worst effected roads and see if they could draw out the bandits, what could go wrong? On the bright side they discover the gnolls have bounties, some nobles in Valysar are offering 100gp per gnoll ear (only the left ones), and 5,000gp for the gnoll leader's head.    \n  \nSo the party are travelling along, they pass a wreck of a caravan with slaughtered guards which reinforces their \"We've got to do something attitude.\" despite having the Wand of Orcus in the same sentient magic bag of holding as their friend's corpse... The party are starting to give Barry weird looks now, because he's not vanishing like the normal temporary mules do, ever since Pandemonium and putting the Wand of Orcus in him... however whilst they're discussing this they're ambushed.  \n  \nTwelve Gnolls, six on either side of the road, stand up. They were lying in small pits covered until they heard the approaching wagon, the party didn't see them and thus the ambush began with the gnolls rushing the wagon and attempting to disable the wheels / horses. now Ragnam the dwarf got to dive into the fray showing off his Dwarvish Axe Whirlwind technique and suggesting the others follow the Advanced Dwarfish Military Tactics like: \"Twat 'em in the faaaace\".  \nKurask managed to lance the gnolls who were attacking the horses. Fortinbras covered the wheels, Norril helped Ragnam, Roku heroically fought four gnolls, knocking them down to the ground, however the tripped gnolls dragged him to the floor and grappled him; Roku wasn't took worried with his survival skills but once the gnolls pinned him and took turns with Coup de Graces he got worried fast. He succeeded his saves but it was close, but luckily his allies killed the gnolls before they could end Roku. The Gnolls only did 1d8+3, which barely scratched Roku's DR 8, however the pinning led to a chokehold, then the unconscious Roku was taking 1d8+3 x 3 as a coup de grace. Barely passing his saves vs death, he had enough HP to survive long enough for his allies.  \n  \nThe party captured a Gnoll and began to collect ears, including the live gnoll's ear. He felt compelled to tell them about the camp, with 30-40 more warriors and the master. The party felt that the 12 gnolls were quite a struggle, so they were not optimistic about fighting 30. The party got quite close to the gnoll camp, hiding in the woods, the captured gnoll was \"set free\" when the Paladin executed him and the party decided to plan.  \nFortinbras at this point noticed he was growing troll scales as he healed, his claws were bigger, he felt angrier (frenzy 1/day) and the party noticed he was starting to smell like a bog heap. He realised his ring was cursed.  \n  \n**Session 21**  \n  \nThe party notice a solitary gnoll riding a warg heading in their direction, not being ones to trust gnolls Fortinbras sends out his familiar, the Wyrmling Silver Dragon Nero. Paralysing breath leaves the gnoll rider on the floor and the unaffected warg guarding it's rider. The party rush into combat with the Warg, Baha ends up being almost eaten whilst they bring the Warg down which buys the rider enough time to surrender, telling the party he's only hear to deliver a challenge.  \n  \nThe Gnoll tells them that the master has offered them a trial by champion, should they win his forces will disband, should he win they will hand over their arms, armour and magical items and leave. Should they refuse his terms he will assault them with his full force; the party don't think they could outrun many more wargs.  \n  \nThey send the messenger back telling him they will accept the challenge and contemplate running, and talk battle strategies. They decide to send in Roku with a number of buff spells running as their champion.  \n  \nThe master of the gnoll bandits appears, riding a large warg, he has 8 gnolls with him each on their own wargs. They form a half circle as the Banditmaster steps forth and I describe him; [A Gnoll, large as a bugbear, covered in spiked armours and leathers. Wielding a jet black, triple headed flail and a heavy steel shield. He looks like he's barely containing fury, his eyes almost glow red and he reeks a repugnant gnoll stench.](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs32/f/2008/203/1/8/Domination_by_JasonEngle.jpg). The characters with knowledge religion realise the triple headed flail is a symbol of the Gnoll God, Yeenoghu.  \n  \nSo Roku wins the initiative, moves to ten feet away and attempts to trip the Bandit Master, who proves too strong to be tripped on this occasion. the Bandit master steps forward and swings his special flail. Now this weapon has a unique property, it's a +2 [Evil] [Triple-Headed] [Adamantine] Heavy Flail. Now, triple headed means the wielder can choose to swing all three heads at once, or one at a time. One at a time is as normal, three at once means 1 attack, roll 3d20's and then it needs to \"cooldown\" - I roll for the Bandit Master's first triple headed attack. 20. 20. 19. I roll to confirm 3 crits. 19. 18. 4. Two crits and a hit. Roku's damage reduction is overcome by adamantine. He takes 39 damage, 30 damage and 12 damage. Delays some of it to his crusader pool, and after all the math is worked out, Roku is on 1hp. This is the closest he's ever been to death and there's only been one swing so far. Fortinbras performs an untrained sleight of hand for something like a 24 and sneaks in a close wounds to help cover the delayed damage when it kicks in. The Gnolls fail to spot the cheating.  \n  \nRoku is shocked, he staggers back, using his reach to lash out at the Bandit Master, dealing small hits here and there, the Gnoll closes in, shield bashing as he goes, then again swinging his triple headed flails. Three misses. A collective sigh is heard, tension is palpable. Shield bashes catch Roku and keep his HP low, Roku's dealt about half of the Gnolls health in damage over the last five turns, using a crusader manoeuvre to self-heal as much as possible, but he's not been over 10hp for long before he's smacked right back down, luckily the shield is not adamantine so that is being reduced.  \n  \nThe frustrated Bandit Master disarms Roku, the weapon goes flying off, Roku heads after it, collects it and decides to go for a trip, he finally manages to down the Bandit Master and then with his free attack from improved trip he lays into him. the Bandit Master tries to stand but any movement provokes from Roku's thicket of blades, the whirling chain sends the master down to the floor again and on Roku's turn he lays into him again, the Bandit Master powers to his feet and moves back in, taking another attack of opportunity (combat reflexes!) and lashes out, bringing Roku low, The Bandit Master takes a knee, still furiously swinging. Roku swings the chain around the gnolls neck and the blade pierces flesh, the Bandit Master drops... unconscious. Roku cuts the giant gnoll's head off and raises it to the air.  \n  \nThen Ragnam points at the gnolls and shouts something completely unintelligible in his accent and they scarper.  \n  \nThe party repair the wagon with mend spells and the like, tend to Roku's wounds and head back to Valysar.\n  \n**Session 22**  \n  \n*triple flail, triple post*  \nThe party make it back to Valysar without further incident, it takes some time but it's appreciated for rest and whatnot.  \nWhen the arrive home they are summoned to meet with the patrician, rewarded for representing the city so well with a trove of magic items and generally praised.  \nThey got: Eldritch Gloves (+2d6 Eldritch Blasts), Green Dragon Draught (Drink it, breath a 6d6 Acid in a 50ft cone. 1/day), Ring of Counterspells, Raptor Mask and a Belt of ultimate athleticism.  \nThe party were also offered small selections of land and titles.  \nFortinbras stopped off at the Mage's college and talked to Wizard Apprentice; Wizard Cleanbreeze (Kurask's old character, his first name is wizard, so that's his full title.) and had them break the enchantment causing his black scales, they also took off the cursed ring before he went full-troll, and he returned to normal, they offered to cleanse it for him but the cost of the diamond dust was a little high for his tastes... although they offered to do the spell at material cost only due to his heroism for the kingdom.  \nThe party then took advantage of the portal back to Sigil and entrusted the triple-headed flail to Sir Hunter Von Huntington, Gnome Game-Hunter Extraordinaire, as a member Baha was able to trade the flail for \"An animated shield and something for my dwarf friend here.\" which turned out to be a 1+ Aurorum Animated Heavy Shield and a mug of endless ale. The mug was laughed at...at first. He soon discovered it was truely endless and a fine Dwarvern Ale. It also had one other function, it could create 1 tankard's worth of liquid 1/day, any non-magical liquid. Lava, Black Lotus Extract, Molten Platinum, Water, Acid, Ogre Piss... anything. Ragnam was a happy dwarf.  \nNorril found an armoursmith and upgraded his armour, the armoursmith told him about a Dwarven weapon-rune he had developed.\n  \nFortinbras and Kurask sought out the Archivist, the Archivist was not in the Archives, they were given a teleportation scroll and told when they were ready to find him by casting the scroll with their companions.  \n  \n[Next](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2pdii2/saving_a_soul_from_hades_finale_dd_35e_e6/)",

        "text": "So, this ought to be a bit brief, but I'll share a fun old tale.\n\nBasic framing boilerplate: Game was Galactic Civilizations 2, a semi-old 4X turn-based strategy. It was single-player only but made up for it with intelligent AI and deep customizability.\n\nThe race I was using was known as the Korx. The Korx are one of the races that naturally identify as Evil, and their particular \"hat\" is that of the corrupt money-grubber race. Their unique tech tree gives them better trading than any other race, and their Super Ability lets them start with *all* of the regular Trade technologies. Long story short, they stink at direct battle, but they're very, very good at making lots of money very quickly.\n\nThe early phases of the campaign were rough for me. My ridiculously poor production meant that in the initial colony rush I was only able to grab two other planets besides my homeworld before being surrounded; one relatively-decent middle-class world and one low-class \"Mars\"-type world that's guaranteed to spawn in your home solar system, that's habitable but only just. This was a very poor situation. Without lots of worlds and people to fill them, my tax intake was very low. More importantly, I'd also never be competitive with production or research.\n\nBut I had trade. Trade revenue is based on a lot of factors, distance being important among them, and so I took my shaky economy and turned every credit I could wring out of the poor saps in my empire into fielding scouts, trade ships, and range-boosting life support modules.\n\nI flung scouts to the farthest corners of my life support system ranges, heralding the trade ship after trade ship following in their wake. I met a race, I isolated their homeworld, and I set up a trade route there as fast as I could. Once the money started flowing in, I built economic starbases; special structures that were lightly defended but which gave bonuses to trade routes moving through their sphere of influence.\n\nI'd do business with anybody. Goody-two-shoes Iconians or their ancient, murderous Borg-like creations, the Yor. Terrans or Altarians, Arceans or Drengin. If they had any kind of presence in the galaxy worth mentioning, they got the Korx-Mart mobile storefronts.\n\nI was still, militarily, a nonentity. I was catching up in research because I was pouring a lot of my money into funding, but I was never going to be able to catch up in the military game because my production base was just too pathetic. But I was filthy rich, and I was friendly with just about everybody on the map because I was everyone's best trade partner. A couple of the bigger military powers were actually partly reliant on me, because they needed the funding from my trade routes to balance their budgets at all.\n\nAnd then the Iconians started getting irritable with me. \"Ooh, Korx, you're so evil,\" they said. \"We take moral offense to the fact that you sell baby meat to the Drengin,\" they said. (It's *cloned,* you elitist jackholes!)\n\nIt was all a pretext, of course. They saw me as easy meat! Their military, while not impressive by galactic standards at the time, was more than a match for my paltry patrol ships and scouts.\n\nThat didn't last long.\n\nOne turn after the Iconian embassy formally submitted their declaration of war, the galactic communications network suddenly lit up and the various Korx embassies started handing out credits under the table. A few trillion credits here, a few trillion there... a major shot in the arm to anyone else's economy, but to me, pocket change. I would have liked to see the Iconian leader's face when his advisors came to inform him that the Arceans, Drengin, Yor, and Drath had all declared war on him *simultaneously.*\n\nThe Iconian race never got around to invading Korx space. It turned out they were a little busy. But we learned a lesson there, and I promptly informed my scientists that they needed to do some research on better PR.\n\nThey presented me two solutions. First, a Propaganda Center that would help deceive our enemies as to our true military power. I constructed one immediately on my homeworld and purchased a number of military ships outfitted with the best weapons tech I could afford to buy from my trading partners. The ships were worthless in a real fight, being little more than unarmored freighter shells covered in missile ports, but the propaganda effect was the real point: with the help of the Propaganda Center, a few of these gun hulks looked to the rest of the galaxy like a sizable military. They orbited my homeworld, a massive paper tiger, but one whose fangs the rest of the galaxy believed. This meant that the tantalizing lure of lightly-defended worlds that had drawn the Iconians to their doom was no longer a factor.\n\nSecond, some serious public relations. We were viewed by the rest of the galaxy as an Evil race, more predisposed towards baby-mauling and puppy-punting than anything else. This put us on naturally bad terms with several major races, and was all around a net negative in the balance sheet. The answer, as with so many other things, was cash: I ordered my scientists to research the galaxy and come to me with a list of what they all considered ethical... and once I had it, I paid off my own citizens to change their ways.\n\nOvernight, the Korx adopted neutrality. No more baby-seal-clubbing parties, no more endangered species safaris. Neutral. Maybe not the most palatable option for either the evil warmongerers or the goody-two-shoes races, but considering that I was still the keystone of every notable economy in the known galaxy, they were willing to overlook minor disagreements. Our trade options expanded, as Neutral races are also allowed to have more trade routes...\n\nThat led us to the end, for Neutrality had one more benefit. Our scientists came before me and told me they had devised a way to build a Neutrality Learning Center. Much more powerful than our best labs, they were massive universities capable of attracting the greatest minds in the galaxy (regardless of ethical views). Mounds of cash payments to construction firms later, our research went from backwards and pathetic to one of the galaxy's best, and our course was set.\n\n\"Leader,\" my head of science proclaimed. \"The Precursors that came before us, they didn't die. They went somewhere. Somewhere else. Somewhere greater. I believe we can follow them! We merely have to understand how!\"\n\nI'm glad I managed to control my face. If he'd seen the gleam in my eye at that point, I'm sure the poor man would have been crushed.\n\nOur entire economy rapidly geared for pure research. The greatest minds of a galaxy, funded by an economy developed from skimming the cream off of every transaction worth mentioning on a galactic scale, went into overdrive. This drew ire from some, who felt that we were maybe overstepping our bounds, but their dissenting voices were rapidly silenced. I paid their enemies a handsome bounty to crush them, then reaped it back selling them the ships and guns they used to do it.\n\nIn the end, we never bothered to achieve Transcendence. It would have been a step down. We were rich beyond imagining, menial labor in my empire had been abolished and outsourced to less-important races, and everyone who wasn't already on our payroll had been crushed or enslaved. \n\nThe surviving leadership of all the galaxy's people met on my homeworld to jointly sign a treaty of unification. We entered into a glorious new era as the Federation of Peaceful Beings... a wholly owned subsidiary of the Korx Imperial Family, LLC.\n\nVeni, Vidi... Emi.\n\nI came... I saw... I **bought.**",

        "text": "[Another tale from that glorious time I got to DM a game!](http://redd.it/2oqfiq) For those of you who weren't here last time, the party (consisting of Rose the dullahan ranger, Pratena the cyclops murderchild, Fishnaut the starry-eyed sorcerer, and Sleazeball the greasy summoner) had just officially won a battle with about fifty goblins and some sort of gigantic furry thing by way of hucking acid in its face. The one responsible for most of the damage to the hairy goblinoid abomination, another cyclops holding a mace significantly larger than an anvil, was relieved and impressed that the battle was finally over. The cyclops then took the time to have a little chat with Pratena, as they both knew a little sign language.\n\nWith that, the party learned the name of the cyclops that was watching over them, and they were given business cards containing a set of geographical coordinates and the name of an organization- \"Asshole Patrol\". Pratena, Rose, Fishnaut and Sleazeball each pocketed a card and made a mental note to check this out later. Why later? Because it was time for LOOTING!\n\nPratena nabbed the giant fuzz-monster's axe (which had been a couple of rapiers during the fight, but now it was back to an axe for some reason) and started eating a bunch of corpses. Sleazeball decapitated the hairy whatsit and mouted its head on an incredibly shitty plaque, proudly displaying it to the townsfolk that the party had just saved. Rose gathered just about all of the weapons on the battlefield (including some sort of nifty crank crossbow), and Fishnaut negotiated with the local \"queen\" about getting a reward for their work. Fishnaut got paid, Rose started tinkering with her armor, Pratena acted on her best (non-murderous) behavior, and Sleazeball found a surviving goblin with a completely shattered pelvis and started melting its face with acid while it screamed for mercy. Wait, what?\n\nThe town guards (who *all survived the battle*, by the way) did not like this particular turn of events and ineptly chased sleazeball away from the sizzling goblin. Sleazeball complained bitterly about not getting the respect he deserved, but it's a bit hard to respect someone when they're melting the face of a potential intelligence asset while it screams and cries. I MEAN, WHY.\n\nThings perked up after that, though. The local inn offered the party free room and board for the night, Rose accidentally stole the queen's cat (who subsequently became Rose's animal companion), and Fishnaut got two flasks of feelgood juice from the town alchemist to cure the nasty diseases that had recently been plauging him. Against the alcehmist's instructions, he downed both of them at once and collapsed in the middle of the town square, shitting a flaming hole through his pants and hacking up blue gunk until he passed out. Maybe next time he'll read the warning label.\n\nThe next morning, most of the townsfolk and all of the guards had gathered outside the inn. Fearing the worst, the party opens the door to find... gratitude, new boots, and free supplies. D'aw. The townsfolk also tried interrogating a couple of captured goblins, but one of them didn't speak common- the one with the shattered pelvis. So the guards had gift-wrapped him on a cart and directed the party to a nearby settlement of gnomes, who would be \"quite interested in a live subject that nobody would miss\". Smelling more coin in the air, and checking that this was in the same direction as the coordinates on their shiny new business cards, the party set out with their prisoner in tow.\n\nOn the way, they came across a tree that had fallen across the road. As this was the premise of every roadside robbery ever, the party immediately started casting defensive buffs and looking for the assholes responsible. Not much later, they found the cause- a group of gnomes hiding in the bushes. The gnomes attacked, spells were cast, people were bludgeoned and Fishnaut got stabbed, but the gnomes ultimately surrendered when Sleazeball's eidolon got her shapely claws on the caster-gnome. Surprisingly, nobody was seriously injured- only one gnome had been knocked unconscious, and it seemed like the gnomes were intentionally going for painful injuries, not kills. Whatever. The party let them go with a stern warning and a swift boot to the ass.\n\nShortly after, they came upon a fork in the road, with one branch labeled \"Shiftscale Spring\" and the other \"Gizmo Gulch\". So obviously, the gnome town was down the second path. They set off, and soon arrived in a crammed little town with 5-feet-high buldings and the sounds of machinery everywhere. A gnome at the entrance of the village cheerfully greeted the party, saw their groaning prisoner, and shouted something to the gnomes at large. Soon after, a crowd of gnomes had gathered, each one shouting a number at the top of their lungs. The party offloaded the goblin prisoner for a tidy sum of about 300 gold, and he was carted into some largeish building for the purposes of \"testing a few theories\". There was a lot of buzzing noises, electrical sounds and muffled screaming.\n\nThe party also took the time to offload some other stuff they had on hand, like some weird books and the giant axe that was really much too big for Pratena to wield. Each seperate item brought a new gaggle of shouting gnomes, each participating in their own little makeshift auction. The party, now significantly wealthier, liked this turn of events a great deal. They decided to stick around and see what the place had to offer. Fishnaut chatted with gnomes about the possibility of a space program (which they were actually fairly interested in), Pratena ate several barrels of \"mystery meat\", Sleazeball kicked back and relaxed in a nearby tavern, and Rose went to a workshop in order to see if she could get some cool gizmo gadgets put into her armor. Like an arm cannon!\n\nBut as soon as the gnome caught sight of the weird, flowing text on the palm of Rose's gauntlet, all hell broke loose. With a wheezy, excited scream of \"TITAN!\", every gnome in the village sudednly decided that they HAD to be in that workshop, RIGHT FREAKING NOW. Rose was bombarded with questions about Titans, crafting techniques, metalworking skills and skyscrapers- none of which Rose knew ANYTHING about. Thoroughly confused, she decided to simply remain quiet until their nerdy glee wore off. It didn't. Pratena had to intervene with her fists in order to shut them the hell up. After that, it was calmly explained that Rose had no fucking clue what any of them were on about and could you PLEASE give me my arm back now?\n\nDisapponted, the gnomes were shepharded out the door by the insistent shoves of Pratena, and the party decided it was very much time for a bit of shuteye, thank you. Well, except for Rose, who continued discussing body mods all night with the workshop gnomes.\n\nThe morning, of course, brought adventure! Some of the gnomes let the party know that the town was troubled by undead creatures who had been popping up for some reason. Despite Rose's protests, they set off to investigate! They soon came upon a woodsy area (because it's ALWAYS a woodsy area, isn't it) that looked kinda deadish and covered with spiderwebs. Through the trees, they could see that the area up ahead was thick with zombies, and there was some dude in black robes up on a stone platform some ways away. Oh, and one of the zombies was holding a sword and crossbow.\n\nThat particular zombie advanced on the party and... introduced himself. Nobody was really expecting that. He gave his name, mentioned how he wasn't sure what exactly was going on, and how nefarious this whole situation seemed. \"Quite worrying, really! Perhaps we ought to do something. And I'm sure it'll all be jolly good fun!\" And so the party formed an uneasy alliance with Vince the undead warrior.\n\nRather than rushing straight in, Sleazeball held the party back while he cast Invisibility on his eidolon and sent her up to claw the dude in the robes. This worked surprisingly well, as the zombies just milled around in a stupor while the eidolon slipped past them. Finally, she got to the chanting guy, and...\n\n\"Omnis Hezzeck Mulvar Tarall- ***AH! WHAT THE FUCK!?***\"\n\nAnd with that, the zombies charged towards her. Unfortunately for them, she was still a ways away, but there was ONE upside- some cackling dude in the bushes yelling \"Yeah! Get him, honey!\" So about three quarters of them charged the party. Unfortunately for them, the closest target to them was Pratena. Several sickening cracks later, most of the zombies had been reduced to a pile of shattered limbs. A few more slipped around her, targeting Vince the battlecorpse. This also proved unwise, as Vince was holding a greatsword and knew how to use it. Fishnaut was blasting things with heat rays (only narrowly missing his fellow party members), and Rose was staying as far back as possible and making potshots at things with her crossbow. The last zombies were caught in a pit summoned by Sleazeball and forced into a cage match with a dire rat.\n\nMeanwhile, Sleazeball's eidolon was having some fun with the necromancer. Zombies were charging up the stairs behind her, so she maneuvered to the other size of the necromancer, and with a swift kick to the sternum, sent him hurtling into his own minions. And the stairs. The necromancer was not having a good day. But the necromancer wasn't done- he paged through his weird book and rattled off the first incantation that looked promising, which turned out to be Black Tentacles. The eidolon was grappled, but there's certain perks that come with being an eidolon- namely the fact that you can get dismissed and resummoned to a completely different location. Back in business, the eidolon advanced on the necromancer again, while the rest of the party moved in for support. The necromancer decided that now would be a very good time to not be here, and tried to leg it- until Fishnaut nailed him with a heat ray and brought him to the ground.\n\nThere was a brief argument about what to do with the still-breathing necromancer, and the party ultimately decided that they could probably pawn him off to the gnomes as another \"patient\". So they strapped him to the cart and headed back into town. With Vince the battlecorpse, too, presumably because he was bored and had nothing else to do.\n\nThe party arrived and another auction started for the wounded necromancer. When the party asked why the buying price was so low this time, the gnomes insisted that his injuries \"weren't that interesting. I mean, he's just burned and bruised!\" So Pratena marched up, grabbed the necromancer's arm, and twisted it into a pretzel. Oh, and Sleazeball kicked him in the nuts, too.\n\nThat doubled the sale price on the spot.\n\nAfter that, the party once again retired to the inn (with its surly european-sounding proprietor, Tarlov) and got some ice cream and shut-eye. Good times.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Attack of the nerds\", TEARFUL GOODBYES AND MEETING THE MANAGEMENT!](http://redd.it/2rxzcc)",

        "text": "IF YOU WANNA SKIP TO THE FIGHTING / AMUSING PART READ PAST THE DOTTED LINE. FOR BACK STORY READ EVERYTHING!\n\nHello, this is my first post on /r/gametales and I would like to share the story of Nyan Atah, champion of The Deepmire Arena.\n\nI am running a Pathfinder campaign with friends with a lot of home-brew mechanics as we normally do. We've been playing this campaign for around two months, and it revolves a lot around a Great War that is on the verge of happening after many generations of peace. The party consists of your standard classes: Paladin, Rogue, Fighter, and Ranger.\n\nAt one point during the campaign, the party finds themselves fighting in a small mountain village at the base of this huge Dam. (Think Hoover Dam). This is one of the first battles of the war, and during this, a giant celestial eagle flies overhead and causes years of Explosive Rune spells to trigger and destroy the dam. The party makes a break for the nearest cave entrance and all need to roll fortitude and reflex and what have you as chunks of mountain and debris and water are collapsing around them.\n\nThey all roll high enough to not die, but they all pass out and find themselves bound hand-and-ankle travelling to an underground city known as The Deepmire: Something most of the surrounding villages believe to be a myth or legend.\n\nThey arrive, along with hundreds of other soldiers, and are greeted by The King Under The Mountain, Drex Stonefury. They are told they are all prisoners and are given an ultimatum: Either work the mining shafts for the rest of their days or shed blood in The Deepmire Arena to earn your freedom - after which you are no longer allowed to return.\n\nThis entire part of the campaign was meant to add a little lore to the area, and also a way for me to sort of rough up and hopefully kill a few of the PCs because I boasted about how lethal this campaign would be. (If you're curious, so far two have died in the three months we've been playing).\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo all the players have now decided to partake in this underground Deepmire Arena fight to earn their freedom and what have you. All the players drew straws on whom would go first, and it seemed that the Cat folk, Nyan Atah, would be first to shed blood in the arena.\n\nThe entire premise of the fight was to entertain the people of The Deepmire and shed blood in the most imaginable way possible: If you were previously a slave you may even choose to fight for your freedom. \n\nThe beginning of the instance has me introducing the two fighters, so it all goes as follows:\n\nDM: \"In the Red Square, we have Oswald Trueshank, a man who was born in The Deepmire, has swung a pickaxe his whole life, and never once witnessed the sun. He fights today on behalf of his family, whom he wishes to release them from captivity while he spends the rest of his days in captivity fighting! Should he perish, his family shall too!\"\n\nGreat round of applause all around for Oswald; he's been a slave his whole life, found another slave, made a family. People know him and they want this for him. Huge thunderous applause.\n\nDM: \"In the Blue Square, we have the cat folk from The Bog; the furry menace and soldier, Nyan Atah\".\n\nNot as much applause, but he isn't really here for that, now is he?\n\nSo there's this wizard whom kind of acts as a referee and he's going to announce the start of the fight. Oswald prepares his buckler and pickaxe. Nyan Atah readies his bow and arrow.\n\nDM: \"The wizard teleports into one of the safe boxes around the arena and announces the fight to commence! Roll initiative!\"\n\nNyan Atah goes first. He rolls to fire his arrow. Natural 20.\nWow, alright. Cool, no big deal but he's got to confirm the crit! Nat. 20.\n(In my homebrew, we have a multiplier of crits. So for instance, he started off at x3, but then went up to x6; If he confirmed that crit he would do x6 damage).\nNat 20. \n\nOH SHIT.\n\nx12.\n\nNAT 20!!!\n\nx24 ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?\n\nEveryone leans into the table. I'm just festering with rage.\n\n18. Okay, no 20 again but he is doing 24x damage to this guy.\n\nRolls max dice damage.\n\nSo pretty much I said this\n\nDM: \"You uh... you step out of your square... and you pull the string back quick as lightning... and uh... turn your head and stare at the King of the DeepMire right in the eyes and let loose... it flies across the arena and pierces Oswald straight between the eyes with such force he actually does part of a flip...\"\n\n\"The crowd's cheering turns to a dead silence as you walk away without even saying a word...\"\n\nSo yeah, for Christmas I'm getting him a t-shirt with a Nat 20 on it that says \"I win.\"",

        "text": "At this point in the campaign, our party is made up of **Remi Latreaux**, a French noble and sheriff appointed by the Empress to oversee gathering war support from religious leaders, **Lizardman**, a Lizardman mercenary, **Guillermo**, a young assassin in training, **Henry Locke**, a steampunk gunner with a magitek cannon, and **Micah**, a mercenary looking to get the war done and over with as soon as possible to keep it away from his homeland. After pissing off the Assassin's guild in the steampunk city-state, they've had five highly trained assassins attempt to pick them off in their own special way. Three of five are dead.\n\nLizardman and Henry have managed to locate where one of the two remaining assassins are spending his nights and spend the night outside his house on the roof across the street, waiting to snipe him when he comes back to rest. He doesn't appear until nearly 2:30 in the morning, looking tired and dressed like a guard at the king's castle. Lizardman snipes him with a longbow, and they spend the rest of the evening sleeping on the roof. \n\nThe next day, they hear that there was a murder in the castle, where Remi was staying, and they hadn't heard from Remi since the previous morning. They send the assassin Guillermo to find out if it was him. The guards have the hallway blocked off while investigators are taking notes (no sign of struggle, no forced entry, Remi had to have let the assassin in, thinking he was a guard). Still needing to see the body, Guillermo decides to pose as staff sent to clean the room once investigators were done. Only issue is that Guillermo doesn't speak the language in this country. \n\nGuillermo finds the servant quarters, assaults one of the servants by punching him in the face until he was unconscious, stealing his clothing, and hiding the KO'd servant in a storage closet. Another servant walks up to Guillermo, trying to find his way back and begins trying to hold a conversation with him *in a foreign language*. He rolls bluff checks and simply smiles and nods and laughs when the servant is laughing, but eventually the servant gets suspicious and starts asking him questions in an accusatory tone. \n\nGuillermo starts brawling with the servant, whose high HT score is allowing him to stay conscious while blood is draining from his nose, lips, and he's getting two black eyes. He throws the servant in the same closet as the other one, and once he closes the door realizes that a horrified maid had witnessed the entire attack.\n\n\"Are you going to assault this one as well? There are only so many servants in this castle, Guillermo,\" I ask the player. He says no, he's just going to be more careful. He pulls out the Needle Bird Mask, an ancient artifact that transforms the wearer into a Needle Bird, which is a *foreign* bird to this country that's the size of an eagle and has loosely attached feathers that end in needle tips. He begins to fly around the castle and is eventually spotted by the guards, shouting \"What a strange bird, hey, come look at this bird!\" \n\nHe's now trapped. He tries to find his way back to the servant quarters door and realizes that either somebody closed it or the wind had. He hides behind a statue, and of the three guards that came by, one managed to pass the perception check to notice him. \n\nGuillermo starts to sway and bird dance to try and buy time while he thought of a plan. He could not think of another plan, so he turned back into a human and ran to the door, smashing it open and bursting into a run, running back to town. The guards immediately shout for his arrest, being that he's suspicious as fuck and impersonating castle servants, and now the entire city guard is looking for him. \n\nA battlemage casts a binding spell and paralyzes him long enough for a few guards and the sheriff to come arrest him and throw him in the slammer, where he later reveals to the sheriff's translator that he was only looking to confirm the death of his friend/employer and made bad decisions. He plead guilty to the battery of two castle servants and was to spend the next two weeks in prison.\n\nWithin 24 hours, the party had its noble murdered and its assassin imprisoned, and they still weren't sure whether or not Remi had died until two days later when the sheriff himself visited the group to explain to them what happened. All you had to do is find out if Remi died.\n\nFor those who are wondering about what happened with Remi, I asked the player who wasn't there if he was okay if his character died if shit went down. He said as long as it made sense and it wasn't a cheap shot, it was fine. So I asked him if a castle guard who he had never met before entered his private room and asked to speak in private about the assassins that were following them, would he let them in? He said yes. The guard wasn't a guard, it was one of the assassins posing as one.",

Pausing only briefly to allow Prince to lie on the floor, clutching his belly in pain, the party sets off to find the ruined temple where the goblins are holding Lily. Throwing well on their spot checks, the party manages to spot a pack of dire rats (and scare them away, avoiding combat) and a poorly disguised goblin pit trap, which the party steps around. Pretty quickly, the party arrives at the ruined temple. Contrasting with the old, worn temple bricks is a large, magic-looking door.\n\nTurlog: “Oh God. It riddle door, isn’t it?”\n\nDoor: “I am at the beginning of the end; In the middle of the beginning; And at the end of the middle. What am I?”\n\nEldamar: “Oh come on, that’s too easy! It’s the letter ‘e’!”\n\nMe: “You sure?”\n\nEldamar: “Completely!”\n\nEldamar confidently walks up to the door and exclaims, “The Letter ‘e’!” The door begins to think long and hard about this.\n\nDoor: “Uh…goblins not know how to spell. You spell too much like human. You probably wrong.”\n\nSpikes shoot out of the door and Eldamar limps away, his leg (and his pride) wounded. Turlog laughs at the elf before rolling up his imaginary sleeves (Turlog was raised by wolves, it’s a miracle he wears pants) and shouts at the door, “DOOR OPEN FOR TURLOG!!!!!” \n\nThe door swings open and the party enters the gloomy darkness inside. Somebody lights a torch. The entry room is full of rubble and broken furniture. Tapestries and carvings of the word GLOBNOB are everywhere. Finding little in the room, the party continues into another room. Yrioth walks in front, planning to find and disable any traps, but only ends up setting everything off. \n\nMost of the rooms they blunder into are full of rubble and junk, but eventually the party walks into what appears to be some sort of shrine, again covered in the word GLOBNOB. A torn note lies at the base of the shrine, but its contents are indecipherable:\n\n\n*GLARDNAL: DOO YOO BEELEEF IN GLOD?!*\n\n*GLONGREGASHUN: YEZ????????!!!!!!!!!!*\n\n*GLARDNAAL: GOOOOOOD!!!!!!!**\n\n\nPrince also finds a white, pointy hat, which he puts on.\n\n\n- - -\n\n\nAnother room contains only 2 ‘harmless’ centipedes. Turlog attempts to “PUNCH WITH DEATH” but ends up being bitten into negative HP. \n\nPrince: “You should probably heal him, Eldamar.”\n\nEldamar: “I can’t. We used all the healing spells on Yrioth.”\n\nWith Turlog unconscious, the party decides to drag him to safety in one of the earlier rooms.\n\nPrince: “Uh…which way is the room?”\n\nYrioth: “Has nobody been keeping a map?”\n\nMe: “Don’t worry guys, I have a map.”\n\nYrioth: “Can we see it?”\n\nMe: “Nope.”\n\nYrioth: “Bugger!”\n\n\n- - -\n\n\nYrioth takes it upon himself to draw a map from now on and the party decides to leave Turlog in the room in which he fell. Turlog’s player, fortunately, is still in the game through Turlog’s geriatric wolf, Old One Eye. Prince leads on (not trusting Yrioth’s abysmal spot checks) and the party ends up in a barracks, fortunately empty of goblins, containing close to fifty beds.\n\nPrince: “Oh shit…that’s a lot of goblins.”\n\nA quick search reveals nothing other than a few plants (which Prince eats, worsening his stomach condition), moldy food and an old sandal.\n\nEldamar: “I set fire to it.”\n\nMe: “What?”\n\nEldamar: “The sandal. I burn it.”\n\nMe: “Ok. Roll a d20.”\n\nEldamar rolls a nat 20 – the beds catch on fire and the fire begins to spread\n. \nEldamar: “Woops”\n\n\n- - -\n\n\nThe party backs away slowly and make their way into another room. Fairly quickly, the party comes face to face with a pair of zombies.\n\nEldamar: “Oh my! Undead! I have waited my whole life to encounter you! I shall treasure this moment for the re-\"\n\nPrince: “Just turn the bloody things!”\n\nEldamar holds up the symbol of St Cuthbert and the undead crumble to dust.\n\nEldamar: “That…was…AWESOME!”\n\n\n- - -\n\n\nThe party continues into yet another room, this one with a pit trap in the doorway. Prince jumps over easily.\n\nPrince: “Come on over guys, it’s safe.”\n\nMe: “You feel an evil presence behind you.”\n\nPrince: “Maybe not!”\n\nA ghoul jumps out from the shadows and grabs Prince.\n\nPrince: “No! Not me! I’m too beautiful and talented to die!”\n\nBort: “Don’t worry. I’ll save you!”\n\nBort fails to jump the pit and lands up in the bottom. Old One Eye tries to jump and ends up joining him.\n\nPrince: “Stop mucking about and help me!”\n\nSusan: \"Susan can try to make it sticky?\"\n\nPrince: \"No! Somebody do something useful!\"\n\nEldamar: “It’s undead. I have Knowledge (Undead). What do I know about ghouls?”\n\nMe: “If a ghoul bites you, it paralyzes you and you turn into a ghoul after some time.”\n\nPrince: “No! What will become of my beard?”\n\nMe: “I imagine it’ll fall off.”\n\nRose, who until this point had remained almost completely silent, shouts out, “NO!!! NOT THE BEARD!!!” She lets loose an arrow which hits the ghoul in the head and the ghoul lets go of Prince to focus its attention on the others. A well placed bolt from Prince’s crossbow finishes off the ghoul. Rose jumps the pit and runs into Prince’s arms.\n\nPrince: “My dear. You saved my life. I am in your de-\"\n\nRose: “Shhh! Can’t you see I’m having a private moment with the beard.”\n\nHere begins the romance between Rose and Prince’s beard.\n\nStevie: “Stevie apologise for interruption, but Stevie wonder where annoying gnome man is?”\n\nYrioth had indeed disappeared.",

        "text": "I must remember to be more faithful in my writings if I am to make any sense of these last few days.  [After the disruptive events following the burning of The Lucky Dolphin](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2lvbjp/an_explosive_entrance_part_2_the_dirty_thongs/), things began to take an even bigger turn to the strange.  For example, we (Turel the Shifty, Angelica the Bard, and Gerard Green-eyes as he will soon be known and myself, Kain, servant of Kord.) visited a neophyte in the ways of the arcane who through a bit of conversation and apparently some much needed attention he agreed to cook Alchemist's Fire for us...  Keeping up with the track record of this group, naturally this led to the poor fool creating an unstable batch which detonated a few hours after we left leaving his study a burnt out wreckage.  I will spare you the horror that was the stench and sight of his charred remains.   All because of a kind word.  I take this as a sign that I should not indulge in the weak anymore.  After seeing him buried we ran into a very peculiar halfling who seems to be convinced that he is some sort of chain devil.  Without much agreement on my part he began tagging along  with us as we investigated the crypt in the church's graveyard which seems to have been forced open.\n\nAs we entered the tomb to the warlock Diabella, servant of the Fey Lady Varen, we caught sight of three figures in the tomb who claimed to be recovering artifacts from within the tomb for their draconic patron.  Chains, the halfling we had just acquired immediately began hauling off with some sort of fel magical blasts, causing the tomb robbers to attack us.  We charged in and killed the first two closest to the entrance, however the third robber managed to slit Gerald's throat in the swirl of melee.  Enraged over the slaying of my companion, I beat the robber into submission and bound him with the help of Turel.  While torturing the poor bastard to see what his true intentions in the tomb were, we learned two things: First, putting the blade of a knife slowly into someone's knee just under the kneecap is a very strong motivator to get them to talk.  Second, the tomb robbers were nothing more than that, desperate souls who heard the story of Diabella's adventures and thought some relics of hers might gain them some quick gold.  As the robber passed out a wondrous sight did appear above Gerald.  The spirit of Diabella had come to her resting place to see who would dare to disturb her long sleep.  After explaining what had happened she granted us a boon in the form of intricately carved jade eyes that returned Gerald to life after she placed them in him.  I am not comfortable with the possible meaning of this action however I am glad to have my companion back.  \n\nLater that day we caught onto the trail of a doppelganger that had been terrorizing the town.  Notably the Mayor offered us a reward for tracking the thing down and dealing with it.  After looking about for a while we happened to pass the town smith, which jogged the memory from one of the party that doppelgangers are mildly allergic to silver.  Thinking that we might silver our weapons to better combat them we enter and speak to the smith, a dwarven man who told us such a thing would take time and money, of which we had none to spare.  Suddenly I had an idea, I asked the smith to exchange one of my gold pieces for 10 silver and off we went, the strangest group in town what with rubbing silver coins on everyone we saw.  Eventually it payed off.  One of the town simpletons caught sight of what we were doing and ran like the Demons of the Abyss were right behind it.  We gave chase, eventually holing the thing up in the Mayor's house.  Turel and I entered from the front to see the Mayor's wife screaming that the monster had run out the back door.  Finding this suspicious I told Turel to continue ahead while I checked the Mayor's wife to ensure she was safe.  Seeing that her ruse was up she let out an oath and ran out the back door and into the cellar out back.  \n\nNow here is where it gets really strange, when we descended into the cellar we were greeted with whispers and gnawing voices at the edge of our hearing.  Sensing something was wrong we ran back up the steps and barricaded the cellar doors.  Regrouping and planning, we decided to summon the town guard for assistance, who in turn brought the mayor seeing as it was his house and all,  We ended up fighting some form of abomination that had too many mouths and too many eyes, it tore at our very sanity and broke the concentration of many of us, myself included.  Deciding that we had nothing left to do but open the cellar doors and face the monster within we let it out.  In my wild fury and thrashing to land blows upon this affront to nature my swings were wide and uncontrolled.  I swung at the creature with such force I was sure it was going to be a deathblow.  It was, but not for the creature, I swung my blade wide and clear of the abomination and severed the head of the mad halfling that had been boldly standing at my side to do battle.  After which we made short work of the creature.  As there was nothing to be done for the halfling we proceeded into the cellar to find a room with the foul odor of magic, along with the remains of a magical circle.  In another room we found the corpses of the simpleton, the half-orc bartender of the Lucky Dolphin and the wife of the mayor, all in varying states of decay.  \n\nTo say that the mayor was distraught that his sister was dead would be an understatement, he was in no shape to talk about payment so we felt it best to move on and rest for the night, especially since the great dragon Veryll is scheduled to talk to the town as a formality in his conquest of it as part of the great game that the dragons seem so fond of..  On an unrelated note, this annoyingly exuberant halfling has been showing up at the most inopportune times, asking all sorts of questions and wanting to be included in what the party has been doing..  I hope he gets the gentle hint that we are a bit preoccupied at the moment.  \n\nI will write again after I hear what news this dragon brings.\n\nFaithfully,\nKain Spellbinder\n ",

A human rogue who's maybe not that human... *wink* *wink*\n\n- Tonttu Tolja: A gnome paladin (Our FIRST campaign) who's the moral compass of the party and the only one with a finnish name.\n\n- Morgan Mcdonald: A human cleric of *love* (Don't ask) who's one of the murder-hobos of the party.\n\n- Thorgan Mcdonald: A human cleric of *love* just like his bro. He's the second murder-hobo.\n\n- Unnamed gnome bard: The player is out of town. \n\nSo the party is out partying in a border bar between a desert and a jungle and after they pass out they wake up in a hotel room next morning. They sober up and then someone knocks on the door Thorgan opens it and asks \"Who the F*ck are you?\" \nan attractive woman answers \" The gal your gonna kill 7 rats for!\". Thorgan and Morgan immediately start flirting with her (Thorgan got her number... that rat bastard) while Josh gets up from the couch and asks her \"Why?\" (a valid question). She responds \"  Because i saw you sneaking in here and if you don't want to get thrown overboard your gonna do everything i tell you to!\". So Morgan is about to start threatening her but Josh shuts him up and asks \"Ok... So where are we going ?\"the woman hands him the address and leaves. So the party goes down to street level and a bus stops in front of them. The door opens and there's smiling smugly Clint Eastwood....  Well, basically he looks just like him. Anyway he asks (LIKE A BADASS!!!) \"Where the f*ck do you four want to go?\" . So OOC i start laughing like hell so of course Morgan's and Thorgan's players start getting suspicious  and decide to walk to their destination while Tonttu and Josh ride happily in the bus. By the time Josh and Tonttu get to the Caterpillar market (Don't ask...*yet*). And while they are  walking the rest of the way Tonttu notices that someones selling Fish (Caterpillar) and starts asking the price. The half-caterpillar looks at the little gnome and whispers to Josh \"*Ill buy him for 20000000GP*\" Josh looks at him for a while then takes the money and walks away while a very confused gnome looks at him. Then the half-caterpillar turns into a green hag and starts strangling him... So Josh calls Clint (Josh got his number, big-whoop wanna fight about it?)  and asks for help. 1,2,3 KA-BOOM!! Clint rams the hag and she flies into the wall that's in front of her. Josh climbs into the bus just in time to see a deva (angel) climb out of the hole the hag was in ...\n\nNEXT TIME: Clint gets a heavenly cigar!",

        "text": "As requested, more stories from my Ork Trader game. Character profiles are [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2o32j0/rogue_trader_a_collection_of_short_stories_from/), the TL;DR is gathering a WAAAAGH! to take to Terra.\n\n___\n\n**DA WARBANDS**\n\nOur GM was pretty \"traditional\" when it came to balancing characters, which was mildly infuriating, but it created some fun. Eventually, every character became a Warboss of their own Warband, which created some hilarious results.\n\n**Zagbar's** Warband was formed mostly out of Orkz he had experimented on. Most Nobz in the Warband had had a limb or three replaced with Power Klaws. He also had an elite group of \"Megagrotz\", grotz he had experimented on, and had them function as elite assassins and commandos. The other Warbosses were less than impressed of his favourable treatment of grotz, but then they woke up with no armour or weapons, so they let it slide.\n\n**Gazbag's** Warband was aptly named \"Da Dakka Klan\". Lootas, flama boyz, and mob upon mob of ork armed with a shoota. He directed his mob from his specially \"modified\" Leman Russ battle tank, which he called \"Da Dakkatrakk\".\n\nLater on in his life, **Zapstrak** fell in with Da Kult of Speed, so his warband was made up of bikers and drivas hepped up on a special blend of 'urty juice and fungus ale that Zagbar gleefully brewed for them. Since the last story he has built himself a new trukk, which is now even more heavily modified.\n\n~~**Snagagrub's** Warband was very shortlived because he took every Weirdboy he could find, dropped them all on a planet and watched from Orbit as they blew it up.~~ We do not talk about Snagagrub's warband.\n\n**Waagor's** Warband consisted of \"Squig Knights\". Insane, mostly tribal, Orks who agreed to ride Facebiter squigs into battle. Zapstrak constructed special fitting armour for the squigs. His \"knights\" would scream \"GET ME CLOSA! I WANNA HIT DEM WITH MY CHOPPA!\" when riding into combat.\n\n**Maggrim** surrounded himself with ~~imbeciles~~ like minded individuals and mostly relaxed in the cargo hold, shooting the wall. However, at Maggrim's request, Zagbar made them a special berserker brew that whipped them into a frenzy. It was standard practice to fly over places we wanted them to capture and drop them, or they would go mad on the ship and cause considerable damage.\n\n___\n\n**ZAGBAR'S NEW GUN**\n\nZagbar was just experimenting with some junk he'd looted from a \"spiky gits\" lab. Orks, being immune to corruption, don't really care for safety when it came to handling daemonic artifacts. He pulled out a heavy bolter, glowing eerily pinkish red. So Zagbar, being the keen mechanical mind that he is, proceeded to hit it with a wrench, because he decided it wasn't loud enough. A strange voice echoed through his head, promising him power if he opened his mind to the warp. His immediate response was \"SHUT IT YA GIT!\" and hitting his grot assistant with a power klaw, instantly killing him. (He assumed he talked because guns don't do that)\n\nDeciding that his new gun was \"ded killy\", he decided to go down to the armoury and test it out. He sets up and fires, but it shoots huge bursts of raw warp energy, incinerating the terrified grots serving as targets. Dissatisfied, he took it to Snagagrub, who said: \"Dere's onna dem daemons in it! You'z got ta purge it! LIKE DIS!\" They then spent the next three days (without sleeping thanks to more 'urty juice) hitting it with various objects, until the daemon finally left the weapon. He was much more satisfied with the much more explodey and loud result.\n\n___\n\n**A DAY IN THE LIFE OF DA KREW**\n\nA very interesting \"itinerary\" written up by Snagagrub da Grim, proposing that our ship be more \"orderly\" like dem canned 'umies. We later found he stole this from a Space Marine world we raided a while back, and he edited it appropriately. And yes, it is the daily itinerary of a space marine.\n\n0400\tMorning BEATINGS:\tLed by the MAGGOR, DA ORKZ BEAT DA SNOT OUTTA the GROTZ and the LOOTED relics are HIT REPEATEDLY. This time is also used to YELL orders, THREATS and other administrative tasks.\n\n0500\tMorning DAKKA:  DA ORKZ engage in target practice with their personal and squad weaponry. BEATINGS and SLUGGAS TO DA FACE are dispensed consistently BECAUSE DA KAPTIN IS BORED.\n\n0700\tBattle Practice:\tGenerally this is close quarters oriented, BECAUSE IT'S PROPPA.\n\n1200\tMidday SQUIG EATING CONTESTS:\tIn addition to EATING OR GETTING EATEN any injured ORKZ can report to ZAGBAR FOR SURJERY!\n\n1300\tMidday Meal\tNormally GROTZ killed during the morning activities.\n\n1315\tTactical Indoctrination: This can take many forms, from information on WHATEVA ZAGBAR HAS CREATED DIS TIME or NEW LOOT to DA FINA POINTS OF CHOPPAS. ANY ORK DAT DOZES OFF WILL BE SHOT OUTTA DA TORPEDO TOOB!\n\n1500\t~~Battle Practice~~ PERSONAL TIME: DA KREW BREAKS UP TO DO IMPORTANT WARBOSS BIZNESS. This is where most of the stories come from.\n\n2000\tEvening BEATINGS:\tWE NEED'Z DINNER HURR HURR.\n\n2100\tEvening Meal\tA feast (by normal human standards) is provided by DED GROTZ AND SQUIGS, and DA KAPTIN WILL DRINK ALL DA GROG! WAAAAAAGH!\n\n2130\tNight FiTing Exercises: HIT EACHOTHA! WAAAAAAAGH!\n\n2315\tMaintenance Rituals:\tEach ORK is expected to maintain his own CHOPPA and SLUGGA, and it is often checked by ZAPSTRAK.\n\n2345\tFree Time: WE SPEND IT FIGHTIN!\n\n0000\tRest Period: YOU GITZ SPEND ALL DAY SLEEPIN' ANYWAY!\n\n___\n\n**ZAGBAR'S ~~ABOMINATIONS~~ CREATIONS**\n\nShuriorks: As mentioned in a previous story, Orks with all limbs replaced with Power Klaws. Usually thrown by Maggrim or another suitably dim witted and strong Ork.\n\nEmptyboyz: A true abomination. No really, even he was disgusted by this. In a team effort with Snagagrub, Zagbar successfully cut of a small group of Orkz from da WAAAAGH! energy. They didn't have the same violent tendencies as the rest of the Orkz, were repulsed by Zagbar's creations, and insisted on spending days philosophizing and discussing the finer points of culture. Zagbar turned them into Shuriorks.\n\nDa Megagrots: Grots injected with a series of strange chemicals brewed in a squig. They ran faster, shot straighter, and weren't afraid of anything. Zagbar put them to use as his elite task force, stealing things before the other Orkz could. \n\nCygrot: Same as the Cygrot in Deffwotch.\n\nPsygrot: Grot he fed a Chaos Sorcerer's chopped up staff to. Killed about 200 Orkz in the cargo hold on a power trip before Maggrim ate him.\n\nMegajuice: Ork Blood, Daemonic Ichor, Squig Stomach Acid, and whatever is lying around the shop at the time, mixed together in a tub of 'urty juice. It makes the Ork incredibly strong and violent, but they explode shortly after drinking. Zagbar thinks this is hilarious, so he sends out the Megagrots to inject random Orkz with it when he gets bored.\n",

        "text": "The second scream shredded what little bit of willpower everyone had. Suddenly everyone but Jimmy was lying on the ground in agony. Finally, it was time. Time for Jimmy to shine and show what he could really do. Unfazed by the shrieking, Jimmy calmly waltzed toward the oncoming horde, brushing past the seemingly disinterested zombies and straight to their leader. She looked up at him, confused, and in one swift movement he plunged his shortsword straight into her brain.\n\nThe short work he'd made of the leader didn't seem to translate well to her minions as, even though they couldn't bite him, they could smell the gnome in his barrel-backpack. As they started to try and climb his metal frame it was all Jimmy could do to try and shake them off. The first few came off easily, but more and more started coming and soon they were latching onto him faster than he could shake them off. Luckily, the shriek having been at least partially muffled by the barrel, Fizzle was the first to regain his composure. He popped the top off of his mobile home and came out wands (yes, that it TWO wands) blazing. From one he volleyed Magic Missile in 3s, and from the other he summoned an enormous fireball that moved at his whim.\n\nBy the time the rest of the crew was up and moving, most of the horde had been burned to a crisp or exploded into a thousand tiny bits of flesh. On top of that, once Fizzle was able to keep the closest ones off of him, Jimmy had time to draw his broadsword and was hacking his way through a good portion relentlessly. Jeffery managed to get a couple good kills in, and Edward physically melted a few of the brains with his horrific phrase, but ultimately Fizzle and Jimmy had done most of the work. As Jeffery put a sword through the eye of the final zombie, he caught a glimmer out of the corner of his eye. He looked up to the roofs surrounding them and, if only just, saw the shape of someone disappearing deeper into the fog. All he managed to make out was the faint hint of a two-colored mask, one half red and one half black.\n\nHaving dealt with their zombie foes, everyone looked at their handy work and took a moment to wipe the sweat from their brow. Everyone except for Oscar, who was once again on the ground, clutching at his neck wound. Upon removing the bandages it became clear they needed to find some Chesto Berries hella quickly. Purple veins shot every which way from the wound and Oscar's already pale skin was only growing paler by the second. Jeffery, technically the most skilled at medicine, offered to remain behind to tend to Oscar while the others searched for Edward's fable Chesto Berries.\n\nWhile looking in what remained of the nearby house's gardens, Edward admitted that even the Chesto Berries were not a permanent fix. It would only stave off the infection temporarily until a high level cleric could perform prayers and advanced magic to completely cleanse the body of evil. Grimly, they all took note and resolved not to inform Oscar of his presumed impending doom. The Chesto Berries would provide relief and they would have him reapply it every could hours under the guise of “changing the dressing”.\n\nSoon their found a large bush covered in Oscar's saving grace. They took as many as their bags could possibly hold and ventured back from whence they came. By this time, Oscar's breathing was shallow and he was barely conscious. To his credit, he kept cracking jokes about wanting to eat everyone's flesh and how, if he turned, they'd have quite a fight on their hands. Edward quickly made a mash of a handful of berries and slathered it onto the wound. Almost immediately the veins receded and Oscar's skin regained some color. He was stable, if only for now.\n\nAfter taking a short breather for everyone to eat something, they continued onward. hella soon they came to the town square which, strangely, seemed almost untouched compared to everything else they'd seen. One building in particular, on the northeast corner, was in particularly good repair. It didn't appear even a single speck of dust had touched it or the sidewalk around it. A quick inspection revealed that the entire building and its immediate surroundings were under countless magical protection spells. Various seals, invisible to the naked eye, covered the outside walls and the sidewalk surrounding it.\n\nBefore the next course of action could be decided, a shout cracked across the silent square.\n\n“WHO BE YE?!” The voice was thickly accented and carried a tone of vague authority. Along the top of the immaculate building, a line of 10 men stood with crossbows aimed directly at The Devil's Threeway. They announced themselves to the 10 men.\n\n“We are The Devil's Threeway! We mean you no harm”\n\nThe man on the roof speaking seemed a little bewildered. “Isn't...that's a bit of an odd name for a wandering group!”\n\n“We understand! It was decided...well, sort of on the fly.”\n\n“It's just...I mean, of the acts one can commit with a lady--”\n\n“WE KNOW. It was an inside joke that was really funny at the time, then it was too late to change it and...here we are.”\n\n“And there's more than three of you so it's not even clev--”\n\n“WHY ARE YOU POINTING WEAPONS AT US?”\n\n“Right! Right. Why have you entered the Fog? Be you friend or foe?”\n\n“We're Friendly! We work for the King! He's hired us to find out what's going on in Portsmith.”\n\nAt the mention of the King the 10 men all share a similar look of relief and quickly motion for The Devil's Threeway to come to the front door. As our wandering mercenaries approach, their skin tingles and here something large being moved from the otherside of the door. It opens and they're greated with a new face. A shining clean, smiling, perfectly sculpted new face.\n\n“Welcome, friends, to The Outpost!”\n\nA remarkable amount of people were stuffed into this building. It was a large space already, but it seemed to be larger on the inside than it looked from the outside, and every available space was being used for one purpose or another. The man who greeted them at the door introduced himself as Christian, the sole remaining Lieutenant of the Portsmith Guard. He informed them that once the Fog rolled in and the dead began reanimating, he gathered those that he could and they had held up in this one building ever since. \n\nAs they found more survivors, they would bring them back to the safety. At first it was rough keeping the dead at bay, as a new horde would show up every few hours, but while scavenging during a brief silent period they found a small family huddled in attic of a home. Turns out the patriarch of the household was well versed in defensive runes and magical seals. He helped them set up magical security, and redundancies for that magical security, and things had gotten a lot easier since then. They'd been waiting for word from the outside for a few weeks now.\n\nThe troupe advised him of their mission, and of their time frame (though not of the impending Nuking), and Christian said he would gladly assist. After resting and taking a tour of the place (Fizzle even found another Gnome who used some scrap metal and other assorted knick knacks to upgrade Jimmy's right arm into a grenade launcher that shot sealed bottles of holy water), the whole building suddenly shook. In the distance they heard what sounded like a building collapsing, followed by a loud roar. Christian asked if they would like to investigate, but just as they were leaving a squad returned from scouting and many of them were greviously wounded. They couldn't get any information out of them, but a couple kept shouting about a “humongous bear”.\n\nChristian advised that he needed to stay here and help get the squad stable, and The Devil's Threeway took off on their own to investigate.\n\n[Character Descriptions](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ovq2a/the_devils_threeway_in_portsmith_anchor_dd35e/) | [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2owwgj/the_devils_threeway_in_portsmith_anchor_part_2/) | [Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2p0ir2/the_devils_threeway_in_portsmith_anchor_part_3/)",

        "text": "“Halt! Identify yourself!”\n\nBoth Edward and Jeffery were yelling this and variations at the oncoming threat. Oscar, on the other hand, was close enough now to make out some features. “Here's bloody injured! Badly! Stop shouting at him and let's help him out.” Oscar took forward quickly only to stop five feet short when he realized he was looking at some sort of shambling, reanimated horror. “SHIT! NOPE! NOT FRIENDLY, KILL IT!”\n\nAs Oscar tried to draw his axe and his cohorts shot forward to aid him, the walking flesh lunged forward and sunk his teeth deep into Oscar's neck. He streamed in agony and tried to shove the beast off, but to no avail. Quickly, Jeffery arrive and grabbed the beast, ripping it off of Oscar's neck and quickly dispatching it with a knife to the eye. “Fucking dickhole with his fucking biting and stupid FOG.” Oscar was visibly perturbed.\n\n“There's no need to curse directly into my ear,” added Fizzle as he took a look at Oscar's wounds. “It's not nearly as bad you think it is.”\n\n“I'll curse if I fucking want to because it HURTS you gnome bastard.”\n\nFizzle looked confused. “It shouldn't be hurting that bad at all, I've put a healing salve I procured from the King's Cleric that should be numbing it on contact.”\n\n“Are you sure you didn't get the bottle of salve mixed up with ACID!?”\n\nSuddenly, from deep within the Fog came a chorus of low, rumbling moans and the sound of shuffling feet. They all turned and saw two shapes coming toward them. Then four, then 10. A whole flock of the beasts had heard Oscar's screaming and come to investigate. Our heroes took to arms, save for Oscar who walked himself a little bit back across the bridge and had a short lie-down until the pain went away.\n\nThough the actual number of walking dead ended up being around 16, they were all dispatched without incident. Having not truly gotten the jump on any of the group, they were quickly dealt with and it came to light that they were surprisingly dimwitted. Easily tricked by misdirection.\n\n“The mighty Dwarf, slain by a lone enemy because he tried to be its friend,” chided Edward.\n\n“Can we trade insults later? This wound feels inflamed.”\n\nUpon further inspection, Edward manages to recognize that Oscar has been afflicted with a magical infection similar to one that had befallen a nearby town when he was a young boy in the 5th Hell. He knew of only one cure, a moderately common weed that our troupe would happily refer to as Chesto Berries.\n\nThe Devil's Threeway took to the Fog with confidence this time, their guard up and on the tips of their toes. Everyone was as silent save for the Dwarf who was so grouchy from the dull throbbing in his bandaged neck that he was almost begging for something to hear him and come shuffling into his field of view.\n\nFor about 10 minutes they came across little of consequence. They knocked on some doors receiving no answer. Eventually they just started breaking down doors to see if they could find anything inside. Finding nothing of note in any of the residential houses, they soon came upon a home that stood out from his surrounding brothers. The door was jammed shut and bodies littered the front yard. An upstairs window to broken out, no lights could be seen from the outside and nothing seemed to be moving. Jeffery, with his climbing prowess, managed to climb up to the broken window and climb inside.\n\nInside he found a blood bath. From what he could tell, a great many people were holed up in this moderately-sized, two story building and something had gotten through whatever defenses they had. On one side of the upstairs (which was more of a big, open attic than anything else) the floor was weak and brittle where it seemed a fire had broken out.\n\nAfter finding his way downstairs, it was a similar but different story. Corpses littered this floor too, but they weren't human as upstairs. They were the corpses of demons, all trying to claw their way to the same corner of the room where a lone body lay slumped against the wall. There was no blood or bodies on the floor for a five foot circle around him, implying some sort of magical barricade. The reason the front door wouldn't open is because bodies were piled against it halfway to the ceiling.\n\nClutched in the lone body's hand was a blue orb that was glowing faintly. It had etchings across its entire surface and seemed to pulse gently every minute or so. Jeffery quickly pocketed the door, rummaged through the corpse he'd taken it from unceremoniously, and moved the bodies from the front door so he could go back outside.\n\nUpon his return, everyone asked what he had seen inside. He explained the situation and what he thought had happened, but when asked if he'd found any objects or tokens or loot of any sort he gave a flat, “Nope.”\n\nTo his credit, Jeffery certainly tried to deny the obvious bulge of the Orb from his pocket, but Jeffery had always been a terrible liar. Oscar, fed up with trickery, gruffly reached into Jeffery's pocket and withdrew the Orb for all to see.\n\nNone of them could figure out what language the etchings were, or why it was glowing and pulsing, but it was universally decided that it was probably important and that Jeffery should obviously not be the one to entrust it with. By order of Rochambeau, Fizzle would carry the Orb. It was noted later that it was the best choice anyhow, as Fizzle had affixed a metal-reinforced barrel he'd found while looting to Jimmy's back and liked to hide out in there before, during, and after combat. It would be safest out of sight and attached to the walking one-machine army.\n\nJust as everyone was wrapping up and getting ready to head out again, a piercing scream sliced through the Fog and brought everyone, briefly, to their knees. Except for Jimmy. Jimmy, ever-stoic and without ears, stood stock still and confused as the why everyone was kneeling.\n\nFrom the Fog shambled a new horde, this one double the size of the one on the bridge and led by what appeared to be the reanimated remains of a teenage girl. Her jaw was unhinged and hanging by nothing but one of her cheeks, and her eyes had long-since grayed with death. Her shoulders heaved with another breath and she filled the air once more with a scream.\n\n[Character Descriptions](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ovq2a/the_devils_threeway_in_portsmith_anchor_dd35e/) | [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2owwgj/the_devils_threeway_in_portsmith_anchor_part_2/)",

        "text": "*DM Note: We use homebrew races, but I've changed them to their closest vanilla match for clarity.*\n\nThe party was tasked with investigating several vanished ships in what was (until now) a popular shipping route between two capital cities. The team consists of :\n\n* Cyneric Kai, a male elf fighter (with a substance abuse problem)\n* Car'rok Helmsworn, a female half orc naval officer turned druid\n* Renji, a human shadow monk\n* Rachel, a human paladin of SOL, the sun god/chief creator god\n\n*After fighting a water elemental and getting sucked down a maelstrom, the party met a wizard's pet Awakened giant octopus (a very friendly fellow) who is concerned he hasn't seen his master in quite a while. While the wizard seems to be insane - judging by his horrific experiments on the surviving crew members from the other wrecks, and the partial flesh golem on the back table - he's also the only person who might know a way back to the surface.*\n\n*The party investigated the wizard's chamber and found evidence of an attack. Pulpy (the giant octopus) said they'd been having problems with \"strange fish-people\", and sure enough creatures fitting that description approached and attacked the party from further up the tunnels.*\n\n*After dispatching the kuo-toas and the Whip that was leading them, the party explored the sub-ocean cave network, eventually coming to tunnels that seemed to be where the kuo-toas lived, and with strange chanting and drums ahead...*\n\nThe warriors crept cautiously along the tunnel until they could peer around, absorbing what they could from the dim, pulsing glow filling the chamber ahead. More than a dozen kuo-toas stood on the shore of a small lake, chanting in unison in their strange, burbling tongue. They were led by a four-armed kuo-toa standing a few feet out into the water, next to a large stone throne. A slumped humanoid figure with a long gray beard and curiously mismatched robes sat on the throne with his head resting on one bony fist. \n\nThe enthroned figure's eyes glinted as he caught sight of the party in the tunnel mouth. He raised his head and looked sharply at them. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked in a rasping, querulous tone. The four-armed kuo-toa immediately stopped its gesturing, and all the kuo-toas in the cavern turned to regard the interlopers with madness in their their watery, staring eyes.\n\n\"Um\" said Cyneric, intelligently. \"We were looking for... you?\"\n\n\"Yes I'm sure that's the case,\" the old man replied. \"Step forward, and you may bask in my magnificence, as befits a new god!\"\n\nUncertainly, the party stepped foward, the kuo-toa's giving ground and separating to allow them a wide avenue for passage.\n\n\"That's close enough,\" croaked the mad wizard. \"You may worship me from there.\"\n\nWith only a moment's hesitation, Cyneric bowed dramatically, spouting obsequious flattery. Renji and Car'rok, though less enthusiastic, still hesitantly genuflected, preferring not to anger the erratic wizard until they knew what they were up against. Rachel, however, remained standing.\n\n\"You are no god, you are only a madman,\" said the paladin. \"And I will not bend my knee to an idiot's mortal vanity.\"\n\nTorkenveer's face immediately fell from rictus grin to sour distaste. \"I never have cared much for your kind. You paladins nauseate me with your tight-arsed rules and unbending arrogance. Someone should really teach you a lesson. And what's worse...\" Torkenveer stood and stepped out to stand on the surface of the water. \"You're making me look bad in front of my followers. These mad creatures decided I am truly their god, and I am loathe to disappoint them. So...\" He raised his arms with a sound like thunder. \"now you must face my divine wrath!\"\n\nCyneric, Car'rok, Renji and Rachel all furiously attempted to ready their weapons, but the wizard's magicks struck first. With a crackle and the burning smell of ozone, Torkenveer fired lightning bolt straight through their midst. Burning hair, flesh, and armor filled the air with their sickening stench, and Rachel collapsed entirely, doubled over and senseless.\n\nCyneric quickly dropped to his knees and tried to stabilize Rachel, but lacked the knowledge. Desparately, he cried out for Torkenveer's mercy. \"O mighty lord of Storms!\" he yelled. \"See you have smote the one among us who angered you. Surely you can show mercy to we who have not wronged you?\"\n\nTorkenveer narrowed his eyes, but lowered his hands. He looked at Renji. \"And you?\"\n\nRenji looked back Torkenveer, an uncertain look on his face.\n\n\"Worship. Me.\" said the mad wizard.\n\nWide eyed and still smoking, Renji bowed low. \"Hail, mighty one of thunder. Surely you are beyond compare in power and in mercy.\"\n\nTorkenveer began to smile. \"And you, druid?\"\n\nCar'rok wore an incredulous expression, but raised his hands and managed an \"All hail the Storm King!\" as Torkenveer broke into a fit of giggling laughter.\n\n\"Excellent! Excellent! This is good and proper.\" He turned to his four armed attendent. \"You see, Morbo, your god is powerful. And he can be merciful.\"\n\n\"Now then,\" chortled Torkenveer, settling back onto his throne. \"Do you bring your god tribute?\"\n\nCyneric thought through what he was carrying, then produced a pouch of powdered sunstone acquired from a dwarven ruin. He offered it to the wizard, who had the four-armed acolyte fetch it forth. He pinched the powder, rolled it between his fingers, and even snorted some up his nose before nodding gravely and setting the pouch to one side. \"A suitable gift indeed. Now what boon do you ask of your god?\"\n\nConferring for a moment, the party decided to risk the direct approach - sort of.\n\n\"O great Torkenveer,\" said Renji, \"We desire only to carry word of your magnificence back to the surface world.\"\n\n\"Granted!\" Torkenveer beamed with delight.\n\n\"But,\" interjected Car'rok, \"we fear we may be too few to spread your message swiftly.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Torkenveer, somewhat subdued, \"that could be a problem. Perhaps some of my followers should accompany you.\" He gestured to the drooling fish men, who had resumed their chanting, in a muted tone.\n\n\"Or...\" said Cyneric, \"there were a number of other people back in your former lab who I'm sure would be only too grateful to spread your fame in the surface lands.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said Torkenveer, now positively radiant. \"What a brilliant suggestion! I'm so pleased my divine presence inspires you so! Take them all, and you may use the passage in the back of this chamber to return to the surface. It should only take you a day or so, if I recall correctly.\"\n\nAs the party left the throne chamber to collect the people they were rescuing, they heard Tormenter muttering to himself. \"Wonderful thing, this god business. Wonder why I never tried it before?\"\n\n*Fin.*",

This was actually fairly difficult as they'd fled Venice without much in the way of portable wealth, their ghouls were gone, and they had to spend every day resting in unknown and sometimes hostile areas. They *did* manage to bring back more news on the Omen War that was erupting between the Tremere and other clans. \n\nBack in the city, the Triumvirate played host to competing ambassadors from the Venetians. One ambassador was pleased with progress the Triumvirate was making and their martial stance against outsiders; the other had disturbing news from Venice. While never quite clear about Daniel's blunder, the PCs were worried that Daniel and Mirlinda might not make it back to the city. \n\nThe uncertainty and instability were just what Reginald was looking for: a wedge to divide the city while increasing his own power. Or at least that's what the Player said.     \nInstead, the character's \"first move\" in this bid to gain power was to see Livinia, the oldest and perhaps most powerful of the Triumvirate. Gaining a chance to see her alone, he then decided to Dominate her and implant a command...      \n... *to forget that she was a vampire.*     \nLet's go over this a moment: Livinia was *old*. As in, she remembered Scipio, the Roman general who defeated Carthage in 200-something BC. She had lived in this city since those times in a Roman manor home, slumbering in Torpor every generation or so to keep herself looking young, to hide from old enemies, or to allay suspicion. While she wasn't some monstrous looking or acting vampire, she was clearly powerful and mighty. Even *if* Reginald's attempt to Dominate her worked (unlikely, as I told him) and she *did* forget that she was a vampire, it wouldn't erase or alter her memories of things done for centuries. At best, it might cause her a momentary mental discord.     \nNope. Don't care, Reginald says. It's all part of his plan, he says. It will make sense later, he says. \n\nFine. A player wants to dig their own grave...      \nWait a minute. This is this player's ***third*** damn character. I'm not bringing in another, no way, no how. Gah. \n\nOK, I tell him. As long as you understand that whatever it is you're attempting isn't going to work very well with this as a first step. As long as you understand that your attempt to Dominate Livinia is more likely to fail than succeed, fine. \n\nHe botches. \n\nLivinia, a bit shocked at his audacity of attempting to Dominate her a second time and with a horrifically ridiculous suggestion at that, continues her meeting without comment. Then, after she sends him on his way, she contacts the other members of the Triumvirate. They all decide that *something* must be done with this Reginald fellow.      \nHang on, I comment. Don't kill him. Blood bond him. Dominate him into servitude. Forced house arrest. Anything but removing the character from play.     \n\nThey agree and get all of the vampires in the city together for an event, they say. Everyone's there. Mirlinda and Daniel arrive (amazingly) from Venice. They're present and give a report to the city about the strange Venetians, the Cappadocians, the slumbering ancients beneath that city, and the Tremere war moving across Europe. Then the Triumvirate get up and summon Reginald forward. They list his 'crimes' against their rule and pronounce judgement on him - he's to be staked and blood bound to the Three of them (sort of an early Sabbat vinculum) then released after three days.  At first, Reginald seems to go along with this, resigned to his fate. But then when Daniel goes to seize him (or maybe stake him), Reginald fights back. Chaos breaks out with some of the city's vampires (like Jacob and Paul) siding (somewhat) with Reginald. They weren't *exactly* saying he should be released or arguing against his punishment, but they were saying that he had a point in arguing that the city's rule was not as stable and secure as it could be. They get pushed to the side while Obyrn gets all scary (Vicissitude 4 {?} lets you become something similar to one of the xenomorphs from the Aliens franchise of films) and leaps down to grapple with Reginald. Reginald manages to escape (barely), but as soon as he gets outside, he attempts to seize a torch with the intention of throwing it back into the building he just left (the one with all of the city's vampires in it). Well, he did not set the building on fire, but he did pretty much unify the city's vampires against him. \n\nThe PCs all flee the lightly burning building and several of them attack/grab Reginald. He gets staked and over the next month gets blood bound first to the Triumvirate then (allegedly) to all the vampires in the city. In reality, this second bond of course didn't work. Instead he was simply Dominated to serve and protect the city. \n\nAnd then, warships blocked the harbor. ",

        "text": "The story opened in a nameless wilderness town in the northern wasteland of Anchor. All but Jimmy and Theodore had, one way or another, found their way to a single tavern (though perhaps not entirely by chance). They did not know one another. The bitter chill of the weather had halted any adventuring and most folks were either in their homes or at the Tavern. \n\nOscar had taken to his ale early that day, just as the cold front had been pushing in, so he was well beyond a comfortable inebriation. While clumsily hitting on a *hella* disinterested and *hella* spoken-for Half-Orc, Oscar was tapped on the shoulder by her boyfriend who was just returning from the washroom. Being drunk as shit, Oscar couldn't understand why this Half-Orc gentleman was so upset with him. Oscar began wildly gesturing and trying to bring the general demeanor of the room back up (as everyone was watching, waiting for a fight to break out between this piss-drunk dwarf and a Half-Orc two and a half times his size) and in his stupor wasn't paying attention to where his arms were going.\n\nMug in hand, Oscar's fist slammed into the jaw of the Half-Orc, shattering the pewter mug on contact and showering the surrounding area in ale. Fully aware of what he'd just accidentally done, Oscar stood in shock. His opponent, obviously, started swinging.\n\nTo say a fight broke out is a little bit of an understatement because the entire tavern, which was filled to the brim with patrons, erupted into violence. Every single person was suddenly under attack. The whole thing was basically a powder keg just waiting for someone to throw the first punch. After effectively taking out half of the tavern patrons, it became clear that the only ones in the place that had any sort of real experience in mass chaos were our future party members. They would've kept going had a squad of the Capital's thugs (a military division nicknamed Anchor's Chain) not suddenly stormed in and started knocking people out cold. Jeffery was the only one to put up any sort of real fight, as his quick reflexes and knowledge of the political climate of this country helped him identify immediately who was storming this building. He tried to make a run for it out the back door of the Tavern, but there were only more jackbooted soldiers waiting there.\n\nIt wasn't unheard of for the king's army to enlist low-level troublemakers and brawlers throughout his land into the military, and they were often times rounded up and taken by caravan-load from wherever they were arrested to the capital for enlistment. This was different, though, because when our heroes woke up they were in the King's Court, unshackled and no worse for wear. There were, of course, guards at every exit as well as a great many archers in the room, but no one seemed to be immediately wanting to murder them. Shortly after they woke, the King strode into the room with his grand, purple robes and perfect hair billowing behind him. He spoke with a high-pitched regalement, and in whispers the soon-to-be-party began referring to him as King Susan.\n\nAfter the formalities, the King informed them that they were to be enlisted as a sort of special-forces for the Kingdom. He had heard of their separate adventures (we were all starting at 5th level) and had orchestrated that they all be in the same place at the same time so he could kidnap them.\n\n“Why not just contact us each and give us an offer to join,” asked Pazuzu, clearly irate.\n\n“Because you wouldn't have taken the job if you'd known what it was beforehand,” replied the King.\n\n“I hella much doubt that. You've got money and I love money,” spouted Jeffery.\n\n“And you've Ale! What fool of a dwarf would turn down an offer of Ale,” spouted a still somewhat drunken Oscar.\n\n“Yes, well, obviously you're allegiance can be bought with little more than a Mug, Dwarf, but with how pressing this matter is I couldn't risk you all turning down my offers. It was easier to quickly corral you into one place and bring you to me directly.”\n\nOscar picked up on the insult and went to rebutt but was shut down by Fizzle, “Hold your words, Dwarf, they'll only serve to foul the air of the room more than it already is from your sweat.” Considering his position, Oscar shut up but only begrudgingly. He was visibly perturbed for the rest of their stay.\n\nThe king of course offered them payment for their services, and made it clear that he had no intention of withholding their freedom as long as they promised to “come when the bell rang”, so to speak. In exchange for their freedom (and a good deal of gold thanks to Fizzle's diplomacy), the group agreed to the terms. They were briefed on the situation, outfitted with the gear they'd need, and shipped off to Portsmith.\n\nAs it turned out, Portsmith was the second largest port in Anchor and accounted for a great deal of trade. A month or two ago, communication became hella sporadic and eventually stopped altogether. Scouting reports told of a thick fog that covered the city from border to border, but did not spill out into the countryside or over the sea. The King suspected a spell of some sort, but every time he sent troops in to investigate they were never heard from again. No ships were seen leaving port since the communication shutdown, and the only other way off of the island-city was a single, quarter mile bridge connecting it to the mainland. That bridge is where they were to be dropped to begin their mission. Standing orders were to discover the source of the fog, find the missing troops and do whatever was necessary to protect the Kingdom and its interests.\n\nAs soon as they boarded their transportation, the group was introduced to Model  24395. He advised them of his history and that this was his first mission as a soldier of the King's army. He delivered his enthusiasm with trademark monotonous tone fit for a robot of his stature. Fizzle took an immediate liking to him and spent the entire trip asking questions about how he worked.\n\nWith the aid of some fairly expensive and rare spells, the journey was made in little more than a day. The caravan dropped them off with their gear and supplies, turned tail and headed back the way they came. One additional bit of knowledge their driver told them that the King had neglected to mention was that if they hadn't solved the issue in a week's time, the King was going to have his Court Mages nuke the island. They were going to level the whole damn thing and start from scratch. Apparently the King was hella nervous about the fog and though it hadn't left the island yet, he didn't want to risk it longer than he had to.\n\nArmed with that knowledge and a new-found appreciation for efficiency, they took up arms and started toward the Fog. As they crossed the bridge toward it they started discussing what everyone thought they'd find within, as it was about 50 feet tall and was more like a thick wall than anything else. You couldn't see more than about 10 feet into it. With Oscar on point, their conversation was soon interrupted by a pained, guttural moan that pierced the otherwise silent bridge. Everyone stopped in their tracks as an obscured figure shambled toward them from within the Fog.\n\n\n\n[Character Introductions](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ovq2a/the_devils_threeway_in_portsmith_anchor_dd35e/)",

        "text": "A close group of friends and I used to play D&amp;D fairly regularly. This is the story of the only campaign we ever finished. We named our Adventuring Party \"The Devil's Threeway\", which makes no sense because there were six of us. But, we were all dudes, so take that for what you will. There's a healthy dose of homebrew here, so bear with me. We'll begin with our party:\n\n**Edward Pazuzukin (Tiefling Warlock):** Edward (or, more colloquially, Pazuzu) grew up on a pleasant farm in the 5th Hell. His father was a strict disciplinarian, but the love from his mother kept his heart from growing too cold. As such, though the source of his power may be dark and wicked, Pazuzu is quite a generous and caring individual. According to him it's due to his need to compensate for the fact that his magicks come from a horrible place of pain and suffering. His go-to plan-of-attack is to get as close to his enemies as possible that he may whisper a horrible phrase of destruction and banish them to the terrible planes of Hell. If you were curious, he actually chose a phrase to say out loud, in character. It's the whispered titular phrase from “Round Here” by Counting Crow. Truly did its horror lay destruction upon the land.\n\n**Theodore Werebear (Werebear):** Discovered shortly after our party arrives at their destination, Theodore quickly became an asset thanks in part to his large size and aloof demeanor. With no weapons to speak of an no particular skills (especially outside of his bear-form), Theodore spent most of his time playing punch-fist with the faces of his enemies.\n\n**Model 24395 (Warforge Fighter):** After falling out of a transport and being left to rot, 24395 (or “Jimmy”) was put into use by the local militia. He served for a time dealing with drunkards and petty thieves before being sold at a high price to the kingdom's military. That's where he was put to use with our heroes and their siege of the island-city of Portsmith. Never-sleeping, ever-watchful and built like a 9-foot tall brick shithouse, Jimmy was the concrete wall of the party when there was no cover.\n\n**Fizzle Ginswocket (Gnome Wizard):** An annoying gnome too smart for his own good, he became quick friends with Jimmy after discovering he could easily attach a metal-reinforced barrel onto Jimmy's back and use it as cover while shooting Magic Missile from his wand. Seldom did you ever see those two apart, but when you did it was typically because Fizzle was off scrounging for scrap to throw together into some wacky new gadget.\n\n**Oscar Oakfire (Dwarven Fighter):** Due to his name alliteration, Oscar started off life a little better and punching things than everyone else. He liked to drink and be merry, and ultimately he was foolhardy but skilled in combat. Though his tongue was less than silver, he more than made up for it when it came down to protecting his allies and stopping his enemies. Though neither cunning nor witty, Oscar was an integral part to the party as he was the only one foolish enough to always volunteer to take point.\n\n**Jeffery Piel'o'Rats (Fey Elf Ranger):** Jeffery's characteristic last name (pronound Pie-el-oh-rats) came from the miniature his IRL gentlemen chose to use for him. We had PLENTY of other miniatures to use, but he saw the pile of rats, asked our GM, and his fate was sealed. Quick with a Bow and never one to forget a grudge, Jeffery was an indispensable scout. His high-class upbringing after being adopted by a particularly kind and wealthy Elf King ensured Jeffery would have a lineage worth passing on. His skill with arrows helped as well, and the fact that he had no trouble scaling 20-foot high flat concrete walls. In addition, Jeffery had a pet rat whom he also named Jeffery. Not Jeffery Jr., or Jeffery The Rat. Jeffery.\n\nIn our first installment, our heroes will meet and discover the militarized world of Anchor and the misted-city of Portsmith.\n\n[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2owwgj/the_devils_threeway_in_portsmith_anchor_part_2/)",

        "text": "Recently my regular D&amp;D group finished a 5e campaign which had been going since the closing stages of the public playtest, early last August. Here’s the hook: Each of the party members were from a different setting, and we’d somehow slipped free from the moorings of existence. We’d disappear from one location, and find ourselves somewhere--and sometimes somewhen--else. When all the reality-saving was said and done, we all popped back into our relatively quaint and quiet lives, as if we’d never left. For most of us, it was as if we were gone for mere moments.\n    \nXlash, a disgraced (read: beardless) Dwarven exile, returned to the harsh mountains now equipped and capable enough to tear down the despot who seized his barbarian clanhome from within. Long ago he vowed to avenge his shattered family, and he would finally fulfill this promise.\n\nVitalian, an odd-mannered half-elf and servant of a Fey lord, met his goal: find novel stories which might delight and entertain the childlike Seelie court for the next hundred or so years (as well as stopping that bothersome world-rending event).\n\nCedric, the human, the weathered mercenary captain, the Champion of Arkin. For him, the world he knew had shifted in his absence. He would return to Arkin, picking up the pieces after so much planar turbulence had left it a shadow of its former glory. Within two years he would become a full-fledged lord in this service to his native princedom.\n\nFaun, an Elven druid, who...I don't remember the details of, to be honest. Neither I nor the DM even remember what his Background was supposed to be, or much else about him.\n\nAnd Duwen, the half-elf rogue. His story is a long one.\n\nDuwen's mother was a slave. It is by great luck and greater effort on her part that his face was spared the disfiguring scar used to mark the untouchable non-persons on whose backs the Empire flourished. She had somehow sheltered him from the bulk of their cruelties.\n\nAs Duwen matured, so too did his Elven features. He learned early to make great use of this natural poise and charm, the only things he would receive from his unknown father. It is with these gifts that he was able to talk his way out of under the imperial bootheel: he became a con man, integrating himself into the narrow middle class, amongst merchants and scholars. They were largely unsuspecting of someone who by all appearances was of fine breeding and old, blue blood. Duwen lived a comfortable life thanks to their inattention and overconfidence.\n\nBut this was not the end of Duwen's ambition. Over time he constructed an entirely separate identity: that of a minor Baron, whose manor and lineage, very real and vetted things which he ‘borrowed’ for the identity, had fallen into complete obscurity years ago. Duwen was cautious. He’d only ever used it once before it was ‘complete’, in a bid to save a friend's life. He was almost ruined then, thanks to an especially sharp watchman, and afterwards redoubled his efforts.\n\nEventually the Baron Hoemmir von Assal’Ai was ‘finished’, and air-tight. He had friends and acquaintances, he had money in his name at various financial institutions, and he had good credit and a glowing reputation for fifty miles in every direction. There were even rumors circulating amongst a few well regarded gossips that a certain young Baron had a penchant for Dwarven women. After the better part of two years’ dedicated toil and hard work, of risking so much, he strolled right into the palatial estate of the most esteemed family in Com-An-Qwur, his name on the guest list.\n\nAfter that it was all so startlingly easy. They didn’t care about any of the smaller details which felt so necessary in the past when their absence almost saw him at the end of a rope. After the first few hurdles, everyone was eager to believe the lie: the charming young Baron, heir to a languishing family, eager to please and with no political teeth to worry about. Welcome company. He was fox in the henhouse.\n\nAs the evening began to draw to a close, he found himself in a moment of contemplation, suddenly so self conscious of the weight of the ostensibly decorative sword and dagger on his hip. He was so close, and the blade so sharp. He could have a measure of revenge--quick, petty, and short lived. Would it be worth it?\n\nIt is then, in a blink of an eye, that he would find himself in a bewildering catacomb surrounded by several other equally shocked strangers. Through various misadventures, trials, and tribulations, they disrupted the efforts of an ancient cult and would return to their own not-so-simple lives.\n\nThe Baron would come back from his adventure with a bevy of new tricks up his now thoroughly enchanted sleeves, and the better part of a dragon’s hoard in a magic bag.\n\nSince then I've been thinking over what the Baron would do with his new-found riches and keenly focused skills. Would he retire? No. After so long and coming so far he'd never allow himself to stop here.\n\nWould he found a Thieve's Guild, and take from them over years, while training other paupers like himself? Become an assassin?\n\nHow much would he have to take from them?\n\nHow far would he have to go to sate his frustration and subtle rage?",

Livinia and Alyce decided that someone needed to go to Venice, not only to represent the city and her Kindred, but also to get the measure of these Giovanni. \n\n*DM Notes: Long time fans of V:tM will recognize that its a few centuries too early for the Giovanni to be a clan, and some of the players did as well.     \nWe also had a new PC in the city (the Player of Verik and the Mad Monk needing a new character after previous gaffes). This time, he went with a fairly old (years and generation) ... ah, hell, I don't even remember. I think it was a Ventrue, there being few of those in the city. It was very close to being 'the Mad Monk' part 2, but I nixed some of his Flaw choices. The end result was Reginald, a Ventrue wandering ascetic who had been unhomed by previous Crusades.*\n\nIntroducing a new PC to the powder-keg of paranoia that the city was at this time was hard. Reginald appeared via ship and asked to speak to those in charge. He flung around applications of Dominate and Presence like they were second nature. This worked fine when he was dealing with mortals and then ghouls in the city. It even worked on some of the vampires (Jacob and Daniel and Jeton, to be precise). Then, he ran into problems when he was introduced to the Triumvirate.      \nLivinia was a higher generation so his Dominate didn't work on her. Alyce had a pretty high Willpower, so the Dominate failed. And then, when he rolled against Obryn, Reginald came up with a botch. His attempts at Presence had engendered enough temporary good will that the Triumvirate didn't have him staked out-right for attempting to impress his will upon them. Also, they decided not to let him know how badly he'd come up against their indomitable will.     \nThey allowed him to remain in the city, and even extended him some local currency and credit with which to establish himself and construct a Haven. Reginald immediately set about building what would be a small fortress-tower, complete with basement Haven and ghouling some hired hands. Obryn was not impressed.     \n\nThis session also saw the return of Saban. He'd been retooled as a werewolf and a backstory constructed that he'd always been a werewolf and had been working for/with Obryn to patrol the forests and mountain passes. The retooled Saban was the head of a small pack, though most of them were simply wolf-blooded wolves and woodsmen.    \nObryn and Saban's players however had a huge scheme for Obryn to start manipulating and altering and shaping Saban's pack into bigger, tougher, stronger wolves with Vicissitude. There was a definite Spartan-inspired warrior culture mingled with the worst sort of uber-mensch bio-experimentation going on.      \nIn short, Saban and the small pack he ruled were flat out outcasts severely tainted by the Wyrm (among other things). There were increasing attacks by other werewolves anytime the PCs tried to leave the valley overland, and the mountain passes were patrolled by hideous wolf-things loyal to Saban, Obryn, and the Triumvirate (in that order). The wolf-things were keeping out other werewolves as well as packs of foreign vampires but at the cost of making the valley a target for certain groups of supernaturals. Obryn realized this, but decided to keep it secret from everyone else. Saban just didn't care. He was the biggest, baddest wolf in the woods and that was that. \n\nMirlinda and Daniel were eventually sent to Venice to see what was going on. Obryn sent a group of Vicissitude-modified ghouls with them; mostly men-at-arms, but also a pair of ghouled war horses and an experimental hound/wolf hybrid (one of Saban's successes).     \n\nMirlinda and Daniel were actually off in Venice for several game sessions. Their players would sit in the kitchen, drinking and eating, occasionally writing in-character letters that I'd carry back to others in other rooms of the house.     \nOver their time in Venice Mirlinda and Daniel would run afoul of competing vampiric families/groups in that distant city. Essentially there was something of a shadow war going on through the various noble families and trade guilds in the city. The Giovanni were (at this point) the pawns of not just the Cappadocians, but there was also a faction of Lasombra influence a competing branch of the Giovanni, providing them knowledge, aid, and ghouls. These Lasombra were the vampires who had reached out to the PCs through their Giovanni pawns. Mirlinda was fairly well ensconced and caught up in some of the intrigue when Daniel made some majorly social faux pas - he'd gone wandering through the submerged ruins of the city and stumbled upon some really really ancient Cappadocians and then blabbed about it. The two of them hastily left the city on the ghouled war-horses, with the men-at-arms covering their retreat (left behind). The Giovanni actually learned a lot about ghouls and bloodlines and internal anatomical changes from these left behind Vicissitude-crafted ghouls. \n\nBack in the city, things were starting to look up. With trade coming into the port again, merchants were starting to prosper once more. There was still a great deal of concern about travel overland, across the mountains - it seemed that very little actually got through. Some of the city's vampires (read: other PCs) started to grumble that Obryn and by extension the Triumvirate weren't doing enough for the city.    \nObryn got pissed and said fine. He had been working to get other passes through the mountains clear to the north and south, not just the east. He declared those open but also announced that the Triumvirate wouldn't protect any of the routes until the city's vampires changed their tune. Then, he publicly told Saban pull back his pack (not all of the city's PCs actually knew that Saban was a werewolf and assumed this meant packs of young vampires).     \nIn reality, they did pull back... but then Saban's pack and wolf-born started to attack every caravan coming or going (unless it was a caravan going to Obryn's Tower; some Triumvirate required things were allowed to pass, but not all of them). The werewolves also started prowling the edges of the city, attacking (but not destroying) some of the vampires.     \nSaban and Obryn staged a big public fight with Obryn and his mighty bone sword (read what was once Verik) fighting the huge hulking monster that was Saban's man-wolf form. Though it was all an act, they made sure it was witnessed by several vampires and that it seemed that Obryn destroyed the monster.    \nThen Obryn goes back to the nay-sayers and says that he's reconsidered. That he'll protect the routes over the mountains with Saban, but that he asks for a small tribute of neonates - one from each of the city's vampires - to be given to him as troops to defend the valley. Everyone says yes (well, Livinia declines), and a mass embrace occurs. Obryn takes those vampires and uses them for further experimentation, blood hunts for Saban's pack, and some are blood bound to him and turned in to powerful soldiers. \n\nThen, the city gets word of a mass upheaval - the rise of Clan Tremere. The Tremere had already been formed (to a degree) but they were spreading and making war against other Clans in Europe. That war was edging closer to the valley under the cover of the start of the Second Crusade. ",

        "text": "After sunrise, the party heads outside to see that their poor little vampire has turned to ash. Being the good friends that they are, they decide to spread his ashes out among a nearby river to make sure he could never disturb their stay at a bed-and-breakfast again. \n\nThe party then releases the Innkeeper. The man is very grateful, however he is somewhat distraught by his third room, as it still contains the three gore-piles that were once his fellow villagers. The pack of dead wolves all over his establishment and the broken windows and front door were just a disaterous cherry on top. After a quick breakfast of wolf-stew, and burial of the villagers on behalf of Paladinbro, the party then resumes their journey to the city of Resteed. \n\nThey enter the city with little trouble and quickly secure rooms in one of the taverns. Soon after, the citizens of the city are called to the square to hear a message from the keep. The party takes their place amongst the crowd. On the second level of the Keep sits a balcony, and with a flash, the balcony doors swing open, and it's none other than the Lady Resteed herself (the woman they were sent to \"rescue\"), and her companion, SaladTosser. ST refers to himself as Captian of the Guard, and informs the city that the lady has been returned from the greedy clutches of her kidnappers. Captain ST then proceeds by explaining that even after his heroic rescue of the Lady, that a group of 5 armed and extremely dangerous criminals had managed to escape his wrath, and that the city of Resteed will pay hefty bounties for their heads. \n\nIt isn't long before the wanted posters are posted. Captian John Williams (ST), leader of the city's guard is offering 25,000gp for the capture of any of the 4 party members, and 40,000gp for the Druid's dog. The party decides to hole up in the tavern, only traveling out two at a time, being as inconspicuous as possible. \n\nThe Druid and the Sorcerer head out first to sell the items they had acquired in the Vampire's village. They find a magic shop and identify/sell their items. The owners introduce themselves as Fisk and Donovan (two characters I played from a previous campaign that the Wilder recognizes OOC). After the Sorcerer and Druid finish their transactions and begin to leave, Donovan grabs the Sorcerer by the sleeve. \n\nDon: \"Hey, you do know you're wanted, right?\" Sorc: \"I know, I'm quite a catch.\" Don: \"Besides that,\" DMeyeroll&gt;9000 \"You two are wanted in this town, have you seen the posters?!\" Sorc: \"Yes, which is why I'm surprised you're telling me this, rather than trying to turn us in.\" Don: \"Look, my brother (Fisk) and I aren't giant fans of the Resteed family, and you two seem alright (An unseen Detect Evil spell vouched for them) so if you two need any help, we'd be happy to assist.\" Sorc: \"Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\nSo the duo head back to the tavern and begin discussing their next move with the party. \"It's simple... we kill the Batman...\" Or in this case, kidnap the Lady, because now's not the time for Captian John/ST. \n\nThinking I'd have at least another session before such a bold plan, I leave the room to write out a floor plan of the inside of the keep while the party discusses their battle plan. Time passes in-game, and it's about 10:00pm when things resume. I return in about 30 minutes of real time to see the party with their heads in their hands. \n\nDM: \"What's wrong?\"\n\nDruid: \"Well... we came up with a plan, that the party could have Paladinbro head out and try to accuse the Lady of dastardly deeds, since Paladinbro is a Paladin, and Paladin's can't lie.\" (Umm... sure, yea ok.)\n\nDM: \"Ok?\"\n\nDruid: \"Well the problem is, as soon as we mentioned this, Paladinbro went outside, and started the plan.\" (lolwut?)\n\nDM: \"Well, I wansn't here, so we could essentially take back the action since nothing's happ-\"\n\nPaladinbro: \"No,\" sighs \"He's alreadying doing it.\" (Okay?...)\n\nSo, now Paladinbro is in the middle of the square, crying out to anyone who will listen about how horrible Lady Resteed is. Meanwhile the Druid, the Sorcerer, the Wilder, and Krypto (Group A) all try to get help from the shop owners, while the Monk sneaks off into the shadows.\n\nUpon Group A's arrival, Donovan waves in the four, recognizing the Druid and Sorcerer from earlier. After a quick explanation of the situation and their need, Fisk and Donovan agree to provide an immediate safehouse, at Fisk's price of 125gp per person. \n\nMeanwhile, after 3 rolls of natural 18 or higher, Paladinbro's words are hitting home with about half of the city populace. He's got a decent sized uproar, and has now got the attention of the City's guard. The guards form a lose semi-circle around the crowd, trying to rein them in. The citizens grow restless, so much so that Captain John/ST himself has exited the keep from it's front with half a dozen guards, which was his crucial mistake...\n\nIt was during this commotion that the Monk had managed to sneak near the entrance of the Keep, waiting on the guards inside to help outside. Luckily for him, with Resteed being a smaller city, roughly 80% of the city guard is now outside, trying to calm the citizens and peacefully arrest Paladinbro. The monk manages to successfully sneak his way across the keep, knocking out a guard or two until he discovers a secret passageway that leads to a false wardrobe in Lady Resteed's room. \n\nThe Monk can hear Lady Resteed outside of her room, arguing with a guard about how the combined incompetence of that guards, as well as the other \"iron monkeys\" outside should somehow be enough to stupefy the crowd into submission. (She wants the crowd calmed and she wants it done NOW.) It is during this conversation the Monk exits the wardrobe and proceeds to hide underneath her bed. \n\nThe Lady eventually finishes berating the guard and returns to her bedchambers. She sighs as she slips into her nightgown and sinks into her bed. It is then when the Monk decides to strike...\n\nMonk rolls a 1 on Move Silently to get out from under the bed. DM: \"Uhh... You hit your head on the bedframe on your way out.\"\n\nThe lady peeks over her bed to see someone creeping out from under it and does what anyone would do at the sign of an intruder in an unexpected place, scream. The monk acts quickly and manages to pin the Lady. Guards burst through the door, so the Monk reacts quickly and, without thinking, grabs the Lady and jumps out the window. Even with a -5 penalty for holding the Lady, he still manages to land safe-ish-ly, and begins running like a madman away from the keep. As soon as he sprints across the Captain, an old Dwarfish woman in the crowd begins to cast a spell. Fog pours into the city, obscuring everyone's view. The old dwarf woman manages to find Paladinbro and MonkMan inside the haze and guide them out of the crowd.\n\nEventually, the pair are lead inside the magic shop, where they are reunited with the rest of the party. The dwarf woman then proceeds to shape shift, back into Donovan. They're lead upstairs, where Fisk guides them to a door-sized portal. \"Quick! Get inside!\" is all he has time to yell as he beings to drag and throw the party, one by one, into this portal. Once inside, the party, followed by Fisk and Donovan, find themselves inside a Magnificent Mansion the likes of which the party has never before seen, along with their captive, Lady Resteed. \n\nTL;DR: He's not the Monk we need, but the Monk we deserve...\n\nEDIT: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2or90m/adventures_of_a_new_dm_pt_1_xpost_from_rdnd/)\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2oraiq/adventures_of_a_new_dm_pt_2_xpost_from_rdnd/)",

        "text": "So after being evaded by the terrible \"Salad Tosser,\" (ST for short) our band of heroes decide to instead learn all they can about the dastardly villain that had swindled them into killing innocents and nearly rescuing a highly suspicious murder suspect. \n\nAfter a brief investigation throughout the town that hosts the lovely festival where they met ST, the sorcerer discovers that ST and his \"Troupe\" reserve all the rooms from one of the local inns each year for the festival. After convincing the innkeeper to assist them in their investigation, and breaking through an arcane lock, the party has now arrived in ST's room. \n\nInside they find some lost clothes, some abandoned trinkets, a few suspicious documents, etc. But as they continue through through the rooms of the \"troupe\" members, they discover a belt of giant strength. The documents suggest that this facade of traveling entertainers included a strongman among their group. Now, as the DM, and after having rolled the item from the random loot table, I thought it to be an acceptable piece of treasure that the Paladin could use to get a bit on an edge. Lolnope. \n\nThe Druid brings to the Paladin's attention that they only know that ST is a bad apple, and that the troupe may in fact be innocent of the entire plot around them. The Druid then entertains the possibility that they very well could be in on it as well. So to avoid leaving the belt in hands where it might do evil, the Druid convinces the Paladin to let her keep it until they've determined the innocence of the troupe. \n\nOOC: Sorc: \"But what will you do with it? You're a Druid, and you tend to cast more than fight in melee.\"\nDruid: \"Oh it's not for me. I'm going to let my dog wear it as a collar.\"\nDM: *Screams Internally*\n\nIn Game: So now that Krypto the Demon Dog is sitting on top of some extra strength points, courtesy of moi, the party is left without much to go off of. With what few leads they have, they decide to visit the city of Resteed, as this was where the woman they had been requested to rescue was native to, and investigate the alleged murder of the city's lord. \n\nOn the way to the city, as the sun sets the party arrives in a small village. The town is mostly vacant, as most of its residents had left to attend the annual festival. There are approximately four people walking among the small homes and cabins. Thankfully the innkeeper is among the four who had stayed behind to watch the village, so he sets the party up with some rooms so they can rest for the night. \n\nA few hours and a few more listen checks later, three of the five party members inside the inn (Krypto was outside) were awakened in the night by a small band of wanna-be Nazgul (cloaked figures with blades) trying to sneak in to their rooms and murder the party in its sleep. \n\nAfter a short skirmish between the party, the cloaked stooges, and a hipogriff (courtesy of my favorite Druid), all but one of the cloaked figures lie dead, with approximately 89% of their insides on the outside.\n\nThe lone survivor of this band of cloaked would-be-sandman-killers is, unfortunately the innkeeper. The man is bound, and after a brief round of questioning, the party realizes he is clearly possessed or in some way not in control of his own free will. So, doing what any good party would do, they throw him into a wardrobe, lock it, and lay the wardrobe on top of it's doors to prevent him from getting out. After that, they bring in the dog, throw all the remaining pieces of the dead into a room and decide to sleep in shifts until tomorrow to recover their lost spells and wait for the charm spell to wear off. (Known to me, but not to them, this would take a week.)\n\nBy now I should have realized that of course sleep and spell slots mean more to a party than the immediate well being of an innkeeper, much less the fate of a village, so I decide to speed up the encounter in an attempt to squeeze a drop of valor or at least pity from the stone souls of this party. \n\nAbout 20 min later, a large pack of wolves (About 12-18) arrive at the inn, barking and howling. (\"4/5 say it's the Best Bed and Breakfast in DnD amiright?\") Party peeks out the windows to see the enclosing pack and begins to block off as many windows as they can with all the furniture they can find. They manage to block off almost the entire building, save a few from the front. After a few rounds of attacking the door, the wolves manage to break it down. Wolves begin to pour in from the door as well as from a few windows. \n\nAs the pen is mightier than the sword, so too is the domesticated animal companion far stronger than the pack of savage wolves (especially when you're dumb enough to give the party strength boosting items that aren't 100% species specific). \n\nThis dog tears through these wolves like a +4 vorpal sword through butter. All in all, I think 3 of these wolves were killed by a member of the party, while the other 9-15 merely served as fragile chew toys for Krypto. \n\nThinking themselves victorious, the party lets out a sigh of relief, but then they hear clapping...\n\nThe sorcerer risks a peek outside to see a single figure standing in the center of the village, about 60ft beyond the entrance of the inn. \n\n\"Well done... Well done...\" The figure speaks. \"But I must ask, who is it that so brashly intrudes upon my kingdom?\"\n\nOOC: Sorc (Wasn't paying attention): \"What did he say?\"\n\nDM: \"Who the f*** are you?\"\n\nIn Game: \n\nSorc: \"No, who the f*** are you?!\"\n\nFigure: \"No, who the f*** are you!?!\"\n\n(It's about 2:00 in the morning so we're all a little tired and creative dialog is... lacking.) \n\nThis exchange continues about 3 or 4 times until I finally give up on getting this stubborn Sorc's name. So instead the figure continues...\n\n\"I am the King of the immaculate land, though I must admit I do remember it being far more pleasing to the human eye last I saw it. Nevertheless, you filthy creatures have slain all but one of my servants. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find good thralls?\"\n\nOCC: \n\nSorc: \"Oh shit. Ohhhhhh shit shit shit.\"\n\nPaladin: \"What?\"\n\nSorc: \"It's a vampire.\"\n\nDruid: \"Quick, Paladinbro, it's undead, see what you can find out from a Knowledge Religion check!\"\n\nPaladin: \" rolls \"\n\nNatural F***ING 20*.\n\nDM: \".....I seriously hate you guys sometimes.....\"\n\nSo after some discussion among the table, we've determined such luck in a roll allows a peak at the MM to read the Vampire page, so long as Paladinbro doesn't write anything down and has to go off of memory. (But when the druid's got 10 years under his belt, who even needs the book to begin with?)\n\nIn Game:\nThe Druid then instructs everyone to apply the magic oil he had every get at character creation to their weapons, so they can bypass his DR.\n\nEveryone except the Monk, the Wilder (who made her own character and did not have the oil) and the Sorcerer complies, as the Sorcerer is busy talking to the Vampire, and the Monk is just \"too pro\" for magic and instead sneaks out of one of the broken windows.\n\nThe conversation between the Sorcerer and the Vampire is getting nowhere fast so the Vampire cuts to the chase. \"Become my thrall, or I beat you until you become my thrall anyway.\"\n\nNeedless to say the Sorcerer's \"Go f*** yourself!\" was taken as less than compliant so the Vampire replies with a pair of scorching rays. First one manages to burn the frame of the inn's front door pretty well, however the second ray magically manages to hit the Sorcerer. \n\nThis is the first time the entire campaign I've managed to deal damage to a PC, so I had to pause for a quick happy dance. However I guess fate thought they'd have to give me a bone as this was the last progressive thing I'd be able to do with this high and mighty Vampire. \n\nIn the midst of all of this, the Monk is quickly and quietly sneaking up on the Vampire, just narrowly beating my Spot checks. Once Initiative is rolled, the Sorcerer goes first and hits the Vampire with a Ray of Enfeeblement, which is then followed up by the Monk's attempt to grapple my Vampire.\n\nNow as most of you know, if a Vampire has you in a grapple he/she controls, they can drain your PC's levels in exchange for temp. hit points. Our Monk was completely ignorant of this fact both in and out of character. The monk continues to decimate my Vampire in a slew of grapple checks and has the poor undead guy pinned. Meanwhile the party proceeds to close in on the pair and take almost free attacks against the helpless bloodsucker, with the Sorcerer's rays making it harder and harder to win the grapple checks. \n\nAfter about five rounds of kicking, stabbing, blasting, and in Krypto's case, biting, this poor Vampire like he owes them money, he hits zero hp and goes into his gaseous form, fleeing to his coffin. \n\nAt this point it was intended for the party to search for clues throughout the town to eventually determine the location of the Vampire's coffin. But apparently they have bloodhounds in hell, as the Druid then commanded Krypto to track the Vampire back to his coffin. \n\n\"Ok, give me a Survival check.\"\n\nNATURAL FING 20!!!*\n\nSo, throwing my pages of notes on rooms, clues, and a dash of world lore out the window, the party proceeds straight to the hiding place of the vampire's coffin. Which is now guarded by two more competent thralls (Originally they would have been able to walk right up, but after such an \"exhausting\" and \"brutal\" boss fight, I felt like being \"sadistic.\") \n\nSurprisingly enough I manage to actually do damage this fight and did half of the monk's max hp, as the Druid was holding the dog back this fight. Plus, once the Sorcerer had run out of spell slots, he just proceeded to /dance in the middle of the fight, because he could think of nothing better to do. Once he started this, the Wilder couldn't hit with her powers to save her life, so we all blamed the Sorcerer's white hot dance moves for being so distracting. The thralls are slain, the Vampire is found, staked, and then left outside to dry in the sun.\n\nTL;DR: My Vampire was pinned by the party's monk, then left helpless as he was practically curb-stomped without so much as a fighting chance.\n\nEDIT: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2or90m/adventures_of_a_new_dm_pt_1_xpost_from_rdnd/)\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2orcc9/adventures_of_a_new_dm_pt_3_xpost_from_rdnd/)",

        "text": "(Before I continue, a little background information: This was before 5th Ed started getting published and we had started a campaign in 3.5 to hold us over. I've only personally ever played 3.5 up until this point; however, the player who'd been playing DnD in all its forms for over 10 years wanted to kick his feet back this game so I was passed the torch. I've only played with one group before this so my DM experience was, and in some fields still is, lacking. But apparently I did well enough to get my group to insist I post this story so here goes...)\n\nSo the party consists of a Paladin, a Sorcerer, a Monk, a Wilder (Ring of +1 Wife Intervention got her out of the standard PHB classes), a Druid, and most importantly, the Druid's animal companion: A dog. \n\nNow, if only to further emphasize my lack of preparedness, I'd never seen anyone play a druid before, and with what little experience I'd had with animal companions, they were next to useless so I wasn't worried. It's been said the greatest trick the devil ever performed was fooling the world into thinking he didn't exist. Well apparently he does, and in this incarnation he took the form of a 1/3 CR dog. We'll call him Krypto. \n\nParty meets in the middle of a festival celebrating the end of an Armageddon-esque age that ended approximately 200 years ago. An older man in a green cloak approaches several heroes (the party) and manages to gather them together to listen to a proposition. \n\nHe introduces himself as \"Salitorius\" and asks for their help in rescuing a woman, his singer/main act, from a group of bandits that had ambushed them on the way to the festival and kidnapped her.\n\nThe party is mostly in agreement and the old man admits that the more of you there were when he asked, he thought he'd have a better chance at getting the party to agree to help, especially with the promise of 250gp for their help. \n\nThe party sets out, and eventually arrives at a small ruined keep. After some scouting, they decide that waving a lantern around with mage hand is their best option to distract the pair of guards on the wall, while the monk sneaks to the broken wall from another side so he can climb up and take out the two watchmen.\n\nNow, as anyone from this table will tell you, I have terrible luck with dice. If I get double digits on a d20 twice in the same night, I'm on fire. So the guards manage to get distracted, and the monk manages to knock one of them out, but the other notices and alerts the keep. Fighting ensues, the monk manages to hold his own on the wall until the rest of the party arrives. Then the dog shows up. \n\nNow, unbeknownst to me, when the druid buffed herself, her dog was also buffed. So due to buffs, dog armor, and a high dex, this dog is now storming through the keep with a 21 AC at level 3. My \"legendary\" rolls bounce across the table as pointlessly as crossbow bolts bounce off of Krypto the Demon Dog, before he rips out the calves and throats of the bandits who foolishly chose to continue existing in his presence. So the dog, combined with a well-placed grease spell, easily repelled the bandits and murdered them, viciously.\n\nAfter a quick search, the party hasn't found the singer, and determine she may be in the barracks. In a true throwing-caution-to-the-wind fashion, the party kicks the door open. Inside there’s a dwarf cleric and an elven ranger. Seeing as how they heard the combat outside, I felt they deserved a surprise round to let off a few attacks. My dice disagreed and made sure to make this elf appear as harmless as possible as his arrows proceeded to hit everything except the party. \n\nFighting ensues, elf falls unconscious, and once the dog has the elf’s throat in its mouth the druid yells “STOP!” Combat pauses for a round as she turns to the dwarf. “Fellow holy man, there is no reason to continue this! Please, drop your weapon so that we may spare the elf and peacefully resolve this!” This compelling argument, combined with a 20+ Diplomacy check nets the party one disarmed dwarf. \n\nAfter some discussion, the party is informed that the keep was training facility, and that they had just slaughtered some of the Holy Emperor’s finest trainees. The woman they were looking for was indeed present; however, she was being held in a cell beneath the barracks pending transfer to the capital city so she could be questioned concerning the death of her late husband, a lord of a nearby area who had been poisoned by an unknown assailant. \n\nThe druid was allowed to go down to the cell, alone, and unarmed to verify their story and confirm that it was the same person. After a brief conversation, she confirms it’s the same person and then the party apologizes profusely and leaves, after burying the dead trainees. \n\nThey return to “Salitorius” (Who they’ve now taken upon referring to as “Salad Tosser”) and tell him that they had cleared out the keep and the woman was nowhere to be found. “Salad Tosser” nods, hands over a bag filled with 250gp, and leaves without a word. \n\nThe party members attempt to follow “Salad Tosser” out of the festival, however he, and his green cloak somehow manage to elude them. The party then dedicates the 250gp to a “Kill That Guy” fund and continue their travels in search of revenge.\n\nTL;DR: Learned two things about DMing: 1) Never underestimate an animal companion. 2) Always run bad guy aliases by a group of 6th graders first to see how easily it can be perverted. \n\nEDIT: [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2oraiq/adventures_of_a_new_dm_pt_2_xpost_from_rdnd/)\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2orcc9/adventures_of_a_new_dm_pt_3_xpost_from_rdnd/)",

        "text": "This post follows on from [part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2omm9z/dd_35_debauchery_tea_party_part_1_susan_has_to/) in the [Debauchery Tea Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ocq3g/dd_35_introducing_debauchery_tea_party/) saga.\n\n•\t“Cock-a-doodle-doo!!!!!!”\n\n•\t“Bort, do you have to that every sunrise?!”\n\nIt’s sunrise in the humble village of Thorpe, and the Debauchery Tea Party wakes up in the Dead Duck Inn. After waking up Prince from his beauty sleep, the party takes breakfast and leaves the inn. \n\n•\tMe: “It’s about 8am and the wedding starts at 2pm, so you have about 6 hours to wander around the village.”\n\n•\tStevie: “Stevie wander to the blacksmith.”\n\n•\tEldamar: “I join him.”\n\n•\tYrioth: “I’m going to stay in my room.”\n\n•\tMe: “Ok. What about the rest of you?”\n\n•\tSusan: “We’re off to see the mayor!”\n\n•\tTurlog: “The wonderful mayor of Thorpe!”\n\nAnd so, to that delightful tune (which Prince attempts to play on the harmonica), the party (save for Eldamar, Stevie and Yrioth) goes over to the mayor’s house and knocks on his door. A few moments later, a portly, moustached man opens the door. \n\n•\tMayor: “Ah…you must be the fellows Seamus invited to the wedding. How can I help you?”\n\n•\tPrince: “Will you be attending the wedding?”\n\n•\tMayor: “Of course! It’s my daughter Lily’s wedding, after all.”\n\n•\tTurlog: “Do you realise that Seamus and Lily have been living together?”\n\nAt this point, I realise that in the handout I gave the party, I marked in that Lily and Seamus live in the same house.\n\n•\tMayor: “Uh…yes. We’re very open minded about that sort of thing here.”\n\n•\tSusan: “Doesn’t it bother you that he’s probably been all over her knockers!”\n\nAt this point, most NPCs would attempt to inflict some sort of physical injury upon Susan, or at the very least close the door. But people underestimate the power of a nat 20 and its effects on a diplomacy check. Needless to say, Susan spends the whole six hours discussing premarital sex and its moral and religious implications with the mayor. By the time the wedding comes around, the two are fast friends.\n\nThe rest of the party spends the remaining hours wandering around the town discovering just how little the starting gold can buy. Turlog gets swindled into buying a fancy hat for about triple its base cost by Tobi the dwarf merchant (short for Tobikhrankht Ul Khrthnarkthanz) and then joins Prince in spending the remaining hours pretending to be a pirate crew in a duck pond with a crazy man called “The Captain”.\n\n2pm comes around and the whole village turns out to the local chapel of Pelor. The ceremony begins and straight away Susan begins crying. “Susan never good with weddings.” Susan is led out the chapel to compose himself before returning, at which point the ceremony has progressed to the bit where the priest says, “If anybody has any objections speak now or forever hold your peace.” Fortunately, Seamus succeeds in his intimidate check and the party remains silent. Unfortunately, this is the moment when a group of goblins and a single, brutish ogre burst through the back window. All hell breaks loose as the congregation scatters. The party attacks and kills the intruders after a few rounds (during which the only critical miss comes from Bort, hitting himself in the face with his sling). By the time congregation is settled, there is a notable absentee – the bride!\nThe party agrees to rescue her, but being unable to track the goblins, they loot the goblins to try and find clues. Amongst the loot is a strange orange flower.\n\n•\tPrince: “I eat it.”\n\n•\tMe: “What? Are you sure?”\n\n•\tPrince: “Of course.”\n\n•\tBort: “Wait, I identify the plant!”\n\n•\tPrince: “Too late.”\n\n•\tMe: “Ok. Just as Prince swallows the plant, Bort manages to identify it as a rare flower known as boompetal.”\n\n•\tPrince: “Oh…crap.”\n\n•\tMe: “You begin to feel a slight rumbling in your stomach.”\n\nThe party quickly establishes, with a quick visit to the local wizard, that boompetals only grow outside a ruined temple in the middle of the forest. And with that, the party sets off to find and rescue the damsel in distress.\n\n[Part 3 - Goblin's can't spell](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2p96g0/dd_35_debauchery_tea_party_part_3_goblins_cant/)",

        "text": "This is a story from just the other night.  My first DMing, and several players' first times playing.  There was a little exposition in a shared dream, which is not important to the story as it is.\n\nThey woke up in a large prison cell, all six of them missing their equipment, all of them in tunic-style prison rags, and none of them remembering exactly what they had done to be placed here.  One of the group, the noble warrior Saiban, rooted around in a pile of shit and piss he found in the corner of the cell, hoping to find some way out of this impossible predicament.  Meanwhile, Snorri Vilhjalmson, the resident Skald, resorted to more conventional methods and tried to see out of the bars of the door, then holler at the top of his lungs at whosoever would hear him, whilst waving his arms through the bars.  Despite his success at acting a fool, no one would answer him.\n\nThere were a few introductions after all of that.  The Rogue, Corde Tenis, was one of the first to offer his identity to the small crowd, followed by Naria, a young Academician, and Brenna, a foppish bard.  There was only one sitting in silence:  The pensive Cecil, a priest of Bragi who was very obviously disconcerted at the absence of his personal items. \n\nSnorri tried to find anything of use in the seemingly empty room.  He scoured the walls, and after a time, found a large brick that was just a little wiggly.  With some effort, he managed to loose it enough to start pulling it out of the wall.  Somehow it stopped after about a foot.  He exclaimed, \"This must be the way out!\" and asked Brenna for a boost up.  She complied, barely making her strength check, while he rolled a nat 20 and performed a front flip out of her hands onto the stone, giving everyone a flourish and shouting, \"TA-DA!\"\n\nAs he searched for another stone to continue his ascent, a man's gruff voice came through the door:\n\n\"What are you pricks doing?!\"\n\nA man all in black approached the door, holding a set of keys, and the party turned and began to explain, almost in unison, the fools' errand they had undertaken in trying to escape the cell.  He interrupted and mentioned in no uncertain terms he had no interest in what they were actually doing, only that he had been paid to get them out.  They immediately quieted and one of them asked what they needed to do.  He introduced himself as Grimly, a mercenary.\n\nHe said, \"I was only paid for four. Who's staying behind?\" He met with vehement opposition to this request, and complied once he had been made aware of Saiban's lordhood, implying dark deeds if the bond of trust (and more importantly, money) would be broken.  They traveled out of the mountainside prison once they had retrieved their personal belongings from the \"Prisoner Item Containment Room\" which had been conveniently cleared of all three guards by the mercenary Grimly.  They started traveling to River's End, a small town, which, as you may imagine, lay at the end of a river.  \n\nDuring their journey, the party tried to get information from Grimly, and he was certainly less than forthcoming. They had to stop and rest after an encounter with a group of wild boars in which nearly everyone cowered behind Snorri, who braced against a charge, whilst Corde deftly lassoed the poor creature to the ground and Snorri stuck it with his polearm, killing the then defenseless beast.  The other boars thought better of this crusade and fled the scene.\n\nDusk was settling.  They found a suitable place to make camp, away from the breeding grounds of the boars, and after a bit of trial and error, they got a fire going to cook the remains of the boar.  Naria got to work cooking up the wonderful meal in her first opportunity to really prove her worth so far this day.  Corde searched for some extra wood and kindling.  \n\nThe boar was cooked.\n\nAfter the meal, and Brenna realizing she had a deathly aversion to Naria's cooking (critically fumbling a taste test, and vomiting violently behind a nearby tree,) everyone settled in for a sleep, with Cecil and Snorri staying up with first watch.  Snorri carved a small horn out of one of the boar's tusks, playing it rather horrendously. A couple members of the band set up tents, with a couple others content just sleeping under the stars.  Grimly set up a small lean-to against a large boulder.  Then he abruptly stated he had to leave, and he would be back by morning.  A few concerned individuals objected at his departure, worried that he may not return, considering he was the only one who knew the final destination of the party.\n\nSuddenly, Grimly blurted, confused (and in a soft and frightened voice,) \"Why are you all shouting? And, on that note, where am I?\"\n\nThey expressed again the disdain they all shared with Grimly leaving.  Grimly then revealed that he, in fact, was not Grimly, but a man called Bindo, and boy, was he ever confused.  \n\nAfter some prodding, they found that Bindo knew absolutely nothing of his condition, but frequently woke up in strange places with even stranger people, and he was oftentimes mistaken for this Grimly fellow.  The group's first concern was that of their destination, again.  Bindo did not know where River's end was from their location.  Given his unstable state, and the party's frustration with the situation, they recommended he use the small lean-to that Grimly had wisely set up and get some rest.  He complied.  \n\nThrough the night, Both Cecil and Snorri found they could not stay awake with how exhausted they were.  A few hours passed with no watch, and fortunately for our adventurers, no problems.  Saiban awoke, and kicked them both awake, scolding them for their disregard for the peril of their situation.\n\nMorning came with no further problems.  Everyone woke up, feeling refreshed.  Saiban ate a bit more of the leftover boar, and they packed up and moved on.  They realized early on that the man accompanying them was indeed Grimly once more, and they demanded answers of him.  He implied that if they knew what was good for them, they would not ask questions and just go along for the ride.  Snorri, in his infinite wisdom, chose to press the issue further, and got thrown to the ground faster than he could say \"Multiple personality disorder.\"\n\nFinally, after his pride finally gave way, Snorri fell in line and they kept moving.  Half a day passed, and the intrepid group found their way to River's End, which, if not for being at the edge of a forest, would look just like a Desert town in the old west.  Only approximately twenty buildings in the whole place.  Grimly led them to The Frosty Mare, the local inn, in which his employer was to be located.\n\nThey came to the second floor, and arrived at a small room.  Grimly told them to wait outside for a moment while he discussed his additional fee for the 2 extra bodies.  After some time and obvious heated debate, he called them in.\n\n\"Oi, Arseholes!\"\n\nThey found him standing at a small desk, waiting expectantly. He spoke in a direct, businesslike manner, and with the higher timbre they had heard from the argument.  He spoke:\n\n\"Welcome, my name is Steve, and I require your services.\"",

        "text": "Just as the denizens of this alternate history 1850s Earth probably had no idea how the 5th mounted army of Arabia found itself flying over the tundra of Siberia towards  Giza, I don't know how the glitch happened.  Worse,when this happened 6 years ago I never thought to take any screenshots, and the game data has been lost to the sands of time.\n\nThe 1st Arabian-Egyptian War should have been a crushing defeat for the newly unified Arabia, but the incompetence of Egyptian generals allowed me to use mounted armies to skirt around their large regiments, capture undefended towns and generally bring the odds from 10:1 to 1:1 through attrition.  The Empty Quarter killed more enemy troops than all my armies combined.\n\nBut it  couldn't last.  More Egyptian troops were produced, and  eventually my second largest army was trapped.  Though I was easily keeping half of the Syrian provinces under my control, it was not enough to win the war, and as incoming troops made the theater more crowded, my hit and run strategy was becoming less and less viable.  I needed room.\n\nWhen the general of the 5th mounted army was ordered to leave Medina and try to slip by the Egyptian army, it was a suicide mission.  The massive Egyptian army at Suez was moving towards Aqaba, a move that would either threaten the 2nd mounted army, or trap the 5th.  I decided that the 5th army should engage the secondary Egyptian reinforcements so that the 2nd could slip past Suez and begin capturing Egyptian core provinces en masse.\n\nPerhaps the general prayed to Allah, or perhaps he found an alien artifact.  All I know is that when he sent his ETA and his travel path report to high command, I thought he was bonkers.  Instead of taking months to reach Suez, he claimed that he he could do it in just 1 day, and stranger, he claimed that in order to do so, his mounted regiment was going to take a hard right turn, fly over the ottoman empire and head into the Arctic, take a U turn at the Arctic circle, head straight back, passing over Suez, and heading straight past Argentina into Antarctica, take a U-turn back, and stop at Giza.\n\nMoving at Mach 2 over water, mountains, snow and jungle, the 5th Army found itself exiting a wormhole that formed in the center of the pyramids.  They quickly relayed the information to high command, but the warp gate closed behind them.  Stuck in the heart of Egypt, they began capturing territory in the name of a united Arabia.  The warp gate turned the tide of the war.  The 2nd army, left without a distraction, fell back to Medina and followed the 5th into the trans dimensional space towards victory.\n\nThe warp gate was not limited to Giza. It was a one way connection to all the provinces around Bani-Suwayf.  By the time the Egyptian army discovered the Warp gate itself as it sped back to reclaim Cairo, most all of Egypt's territory had been captured by a thinly spread mass of mounted infantry, and the war was declared over.  Egypt made concessions in Syria and Israel.\n\nThe 2nd Arabian-Egyptian war was less of a struggle.  Just as Egyptian troops began to mobilize and receive supplies from the government, the organized Armies of Arabia warped into Egypt's capital, and the valuable provinces around it, quickly defeating the unorganized and spread out Egyptian armies.  The warp gate strike proved to be a staple in the series of wars that Arabia used to usurp Egypt as a regional power rivaling the Ottomans.",

        "text": "[Another tale of that spectacular time I got to DM a game!](http://redd.it/2nqpkq) For those of you who weren't here last time, the players are currently grouped into two miniparties. The Punchy party (Rose the dullahan ranger and her best friend Pratena the cyclops brawler murderchild) had just finished clearing out a small dungeon and set up camp in a small safe-ish area while their employer for this expedition (a constantly enraged flaming dryad) recovered from the scuffle that had liberated her sister. Meanwhile, the Casty party (Fishnaut the wannabe-astronaut sorcerer and Sleazeball the greasy summoner, with his sexy female eidolon wife) were making a trek through the woods after a mysterious cyclops dude who had kinda saved their asses but also apparently had a penchant for eating people's faces. Oh, and they had to stop frequently because Fishnaut was coughing up blue stuff and shitting out several important-looking organs. It wasn't all bad, though- he found a termite mound and committed his own personal fecal rendition of Independance Day.\n\nTeam Punchy packed up and headed out after some band-aids and spot repairs, and after a debacle with some chickens, giant spiders, and a localized forest fire, they arrived home safe and sound, got paid, and said goodbye to McFlamy the dryad. Then they pawned off some of the artifacts that they had collected and Pratena devoured an entire cow.\n\nTeam Casty had just barely caught up with the cyclops, and the destitute Fishnaut staggered up to the dude and wheezingly asked for help. So the cyclops punched him in the gut and stole his lunch before running off again. Surprisingly, Fishnaut felt a lot better after that.\n\nBoth parties wound up in the same town a while later- Team Punchy was there because they knew the place and wanted to turn in some bandit heads (Cha-ching!), and Team Casty was there because they had lost the trail of the cyclops but finally found civilization- which may very well contain things like beds, food that doesn't taste like boots, and boots. Speaking of which, does anyone else hear footsteps? Like, a lot of footsteps? Like, marching footsteps?\n\nOh, hey, a goblin followed Team Punchy through the forest path! Wonder what he's- oh, five goblins. Wait, twenty- FORTY? And what in the name of The Five is THAT?\n\nA huge, lumbering figure marched into the depths of the goblin army- some sort of hide-bound monstrosity with fur jutting out at unnatural angles, malice in its eyes and fangs in its mouth. And it was carrying a really big axe. And it had its own personal army of goddamned goblins.\n\nAt the moment, the party is level 2. This was not an engagement they were prepared to win.\n\nWhich is why it was very fortunate indeed that a giant bolt flew over the Team Casty's heads while the enormous creature was bellowing some sort of warcry. The beast staggered back, crushing some of its own goblins beneath its lumbering feet. And then all hell broke loose.\n\nThe two miniparties immediately decided to work together and set up a defensive wall consisting of [a patch of grease](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/grease), an enlarged eidolon, an enlarged Rose, and Pratena guarding the flank. The stabby goblins came, and their efforts were less akin to a charge and more like a three stooges routine, only with more stabbing, clawing, and tearing out of throats. The warrior goblins were pretty much decimated immediately (except for one wearing an elaborate crotch-bandage that was pointing and screaming at Rose- something about 'Clanky Thunderfoot'). Unfortunately the rest of the goblins were smarter and stayed at a range, with crossbow goblins dinking ineffectually at Rose while casters moved up the sides to get a better angle on the party. The giant leader, who was rightfully pissed, stepped forward toward the party and gestured to each in turn, roaring something between a challenge and a death threat.\n\nRoll to see who has unsoiled pants! (Hint: nobody)\n\nThe party as a whole locked eyes on the hideous beast and decided that they would like to be elsewhere, right fucking now. They bolted, dragging along the slower party members, but leaving the sexy eidolon behind as a rear guard. The snarling beast charged her, axe somehow transforming into a pair of rapiers, and he went full Zoro on her ass. Well, something like that, only with more giblets and severed limbs. The eidolon was banished at something around -50 hit points. Lesson learned: DO NOT BE NEAR THE FUCKING WAR-GOD ABOMINATION.\n\nThankfully, the party was recieving some support- that of the cyclops that Team Casty had been tailing. The cyclops had abandoned his portable ballista (because yeah, he has a fucking portable ballista) and was now closing the distance with the goblinoid giant-thing while meaningfully readying a mace so large that it could have been repurposed as a minivan. The goblinoid war-leader thing tried to close the distance, but slipped on the patch of grease that Fishnaut had created earlier and took a huge whallop to the face for his troubles. He was not a happy camper.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the goblin horde was moving in to support their fearless leader, some reloading their crossbows and others casting first-level spells, including one clever bastard who had the forethought to cast [Burning Disarm](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/burning-disarm) on the cyclops's giant fuckoff mace. He dropped it, which was bad, because he was in threat range of the pissed-off giant hairy monster wielding the two rapiers. It was pretty clear that the cyclops needed a hand.\n\nThe party obliged. Sleazeball started hurling acid splashes while Fishnaut enlarged Pratena, who was very happy at this turn of events. She pounced on one of the goblin wizards and ate his torso. That distracted those crossbow goblins right quick. The second group of crossbowmen on the opposite side of the titanic cyclops-vs-chewbaccazilla was very distracted by a sudden charge from Rose (still enlarged), and the screeching crotch-bandage goblin immediately directed all the bolts towards her. It did not go well.\n\nFishnaut, meanwhile, had thought up a plan- he burned his last spell (Grease) to make him nice and slippery, and then slip-and-slided down the paved road into the town, where the guards and a few concerned townsfolk were advancing on the battle. The panicked Fishnaut just about tackled the town alchemist, demanding something that would make him feel less like shit and more like a god. What he got was a potion that tasted like the world's strongest coffee, if it was brewed in the intestines of a dead skunk. The alchemist bade the (now rather peppy) Fishnaut a fond farewell by means of a kick to the sternum, which sent him whizzing back to his fellow party members. Fishnaut flopped into action and hurled himself at a goblin caster, rugby tackling him to the ground with sheer slimy hyper-caffienated enthusiasm. Fishnaut spent the next few rounds pounding that particular caster's head into an unpleasant stain with his slimy, cold-infused fists.\n\nSleazeball, meanwhile, had accosted the town sorcerer and politely (belligerently) requested (demanded) some assistance (SOMETHING WHAT MAKE PEOPLE DEAD). The confused wizard stuffed a scroll of [Ice slick](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ice-slick) into his hands in the hopes of making him go away. It did, thankfully, and both Sleazeball and the confused wizard joined the fray once again. Sleazeball fired the scroll into the middle of the group of crossbowmen who were meaningfully drawing a bead on Pratena, turning the situation into yet ANOTHER bloodsoaked physical comedy routine. Pratena went to town on them while the unnamed wizard belched fire at the survivors.\n\nRose, meanwhile, was spearing goblin after goblin until her spear could hold no more, and then she flung the clinging bodies into the terrified masses of their still-living comrades, indulging in some screamy bowling while their pitaible arrows dinked off her prodigious armor. Really, the archers and soldiers rushing to back her up were more for moral support than anything. That particular battle came to a head when Rose kicked the shouting crotch-bandaged goblin in the groin so hard that he catapulted into the caster goblin behind him, somehow lodging his sword in the caster's neck. After that, it was a turkey shoot.\n\nMeanwhile, the cyclops and the chewbaccazilla were having a throwdown of epic proportions. Disarmed, the cyclops had backed up to cast some magic shit on himself, giving him a massive bonus to strength and natural weapon damage. Why? Because when the hideous leatherbound fur-monster charged again, the cyclops make a flying leap directly onto the thing's face and started tearing off chunk after chunk with its hilariously powerful eye-mouth. He didn't get out of it unscathed, though- the giant goblinoid stabbed the cyclops and sent him hurtling away- which merely allowed the cyclops to get another running start for another pounce, this time bringing the hairy bastard to the ground with the force of the impact. A flew clubbing blows later, the cyclops was again dislodged, directly onto the space where he had previously dropped his mace. The cyclops readied himself as the snarling rapier-wielding ogre-thing charged, the cyclops taking two nasty hits while the thing took a vicious blow to the face. Both combatants were on their last legs, but-\n\nSleazeball's player: \"Fuck this guy, he killed my eidolon! I throw two acid flasks at him!\"\n\nDM: \"Roll it.\"\n\nSleazeball's player: \"Two hits, damage of- oh, DAMN. One and one.\"\n\nGM: (Checking sheet) \"...It's dead.\"\n\nParty: ***\"WHAT.\"***\n\nAnd that's the story of how Sleazeball saved the day with wits, cowardice, and the most piddly damage roll of all time.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Smatterings of gratitude\", CAT THIEVES AND GREENER PASTURES!](http://redd.it/2pa5p0)",

Kinmouth the party was greeted by Erik the Stout, another Inquisitor. He carried orders from the Temple Chapter in Orlene to investigate St. Bartholomew, a former estate turned into a research hospital. The medics there were investigating a plague that had broken out which resembled the one which had struck Sallot 30 years ago and killed nearly a third of its population. The hospital was administered by Tucker Cross, a Flowren doctor with whom William was familiar, the prior having treated the latter’s wounds after the engine explosion which took his eye during his stint in the navy. Research had been proceeding normally until about 10 days ago when the facility went dark and no more reports came back to the capitol. \n\nThe party decided to check up on the miners they left in Roanne on their way to see if anything else had been discovered. They were informed that a number of the miners had fallen ill with bouts of nausea, fevers, and headaches, though most were able to continue working. Phineas went to the home of one man who was too sick to report for work and found him bedridden, too fatigued to even acknowledge the Ochremarken’s presence. His wife had been dutifully taking care of the man but no treatment seemed to have any effect. Reading the man’s memory Phineas found that he had inadvertently swallowed a small fragment of the crystal which marked the beginning of his accelerated deterioration. Using a combination of herbs and alchemical compounds from William the two got the man to regurgitate the crystal. Disturbingly it had grown tendril like protrusions from the original body of the shard, almost as though it were a seed that had been planted. Taking the fragment with them the party ordered that filtration masks be worn by all miners and warned them of interacting with the crystals directly if any more were found. They then continued on their way, leaving behind another lump sum of funds for the miners’ continued efforts.\n\nWilliam suggested that they stop by the village where Roanne’s former mayor had retired to as it was also on the way. They found the old man enjoying the afternoon breeze on his porch with a fantasy book about a white haired, dark skinned warrior who wielded two scimitars seeking redemption for himself and his people. William tried to coax the old mayor to remember if Roanne had ever encountered a one armed witch. The mayor, between reminiscing about the ‘good old days,’ recalled a young girl, whose name began with an ‘S,’ raised in the poor house. She seemed to have a natural talent for magical abilities and was treated harshly by the house matron. When she was very young the Inquisition placed the Sin Mark on her so they could monitor her abilities and guide her away from the path of sorcery and heresy.  The child disappeared however after a conflict which left the matron dead, frozen by magical power. No one, including the Inquisition, had ever been able to track her down again though and she effectively vanished from the world. To the party it was apparent that this child was likely the same witch they fought previously. Bidding farewell the party left him to his book and continued to St. Bartholomew’s. \n\nComing upon the former estate just before dusk the party could tell that something was wrong. The grounds were deathly silent as was the facility itself. Approaching cautious, having learned many times that a grand entrance was never the best strategy, the party noticed a murder of crows lined the outbuildings that flanked the central grounds. Brother, with his superior perception, could tell that these were no ordinary crows however as many watched the group approach with jet black eyes. Fleshy growths covered their bodies and patches of heavy, hardened bone poked through the feathers. Brother motioned to the group and William prepared an incendiary bomb just in case. Their suspicion proved correct as the crows gave a shriek and descended on the group, racking at their eyes and exposed skin. Erik suffered the worst when a swarm blinded him with their claws and beaks. Several arrows, bombs, and wild swings of the hammer and the avian threat was brought down. William wisely decided to brew up some disease inhibiting potions and distributed them to the group, however, Brother refused the concoction for religious reasons (though the exact reasons were never elaborated). \n\nEntering through the large double doors of the main ingress William suggested that they find Dr. Cross as soon as possible. Since he was in charge he could give explanation for loss of communication and the outbreak of corruption discovered. As Phineas looked over the directory, finding that the administrative offices were on the third floor, Brother pragmatically pointed out that Dr. Cross may well be dead already. Erik, more cynical, added that he may even be the cause of the outbreak. William jumped at the allegation and defended his friend’s honour, citing the great care Tucker had when treating his wounds. Trying to avoid conflict within the party Phineas said there was no need to jump to accusations but there was no way of knowing until Dr. Cross was found. Placated, the party moved forward into the hospital. \n\nArriving at the second floor they found a number of offices for doctors and the support staff however no one, living nor dead, was to be found. Expanding his mind Phineas sought to detect the thoughts of any creature or person in the area but heard nothing. As they continued down the west corridor a great feeling of unease settled over the party. According to the mission dossier the facility housed over two dozen full time researchers along with the patients they treated. Some doubts over the later group turned up when they found the emaciated corpse of a woman, strapped down to a bed in one of the examining rooms. Though no life signs were apparent Brother decided, in a moment of divine meta-knowledge, to put an arrow in the corpse's head, “just to be sure.”\n\nExiting the room Erik picked up motion from the gloom. Two shambling humanoid shapes were coming towards the party. When they came into the light a mess of bone, skin, boils, and the like filled out their features. Thinking quickly, Brother loosed an arrow into the closest one, dropping it. As more shapes came out of the darkness William threw a grease bomb to slow them down. Coming from both sides now the battle was joined. In the back of his mind Phineas wondered whether these putrid foes were the aggressors or defenders in the scuffle, however the more immediate need to not die pressed him into combat as well. The last diseased body fell and joined its half dozen cohorts and the party took stock of their predicament. William had expended nearly half his bombs and much more of his resolve on the survival of Tucker. Phineas was still worried that their enemies may not have been so malicious. And Brother and Erik were more committed to finding the Doctor and getting the hell out of this damned place. \n\nContinuing down the hall the group discovered a research laboratory with numerous, scattered notes, medical diagrams, and experimental equipment. Looking over the notes William found over a hundred trial vaccines and test cases, none having any sort of success. One note stuck out in particular;\n\n*Serum 108: Patient physical symptoms abated. Noted increased strength and decreased mental functioning. Patients prone to periods of manic depressive behaviour, often ending in violent outbursts. Find method to isolate physical effects from mental degradation*\n\nThe next laboratory held a dissection table where a body, many days decomposed, lay open on the operating table. Next to the surgical equipment lay another note which read, ‘*get out they’re getting out.*’\n\nAt the end of the hall there were four more patient rooms. Erik and Phineas could hear the sounds of a struggle inside the closest one, though it seemed like only one individual was within. Entering the room slowly the party could see a figure with long dirty hair, apparently bound in a straight jacket, writhing against it while facing directly into the corner. Unsure of what to do Brother nocked an arrow and trained it on the figure, prepared to put him down. Phineas urged caution however and slowly entered the room while Erik stood guard at the door scanning for additional threats. Phineas approached the man but kept a good distance and called out to him. At the sound of his voice the man stopped his struggling and fell silent, giving no response to Phineas’ additional offers of aid.  Looking back to the party for support Phineas decided to ease closer to the man, while attempting to read his thoughts. Only seeing flashes of dark, angry colours in the man’s mind Phineas was unsure if the man should be left alone in case a cure could be found or if Brother should be allowed to put him out of his misery. Hazarding further communication Phineas reached out his hand to touch the man’s shoulder. At this his head turned completely around to stare directly into Phineas’ eyes with his own pools of pure hate, his mouth opened revealing a polluted mangle of teeth and flesh and roared a challenge. \n\nPhineas fell backwards as Brother loosed an arrow which plunged into the figure’s shoulder. The enraged zombie assaulted Phineas with the sharpened cloth and chain of the straight jacket leaving multiple lacerations along the Ochremakren’s body. Outside the other patient rooms’ doors rattled as more rage zombies threw themselves against them. Bursting into the hall two more figures quickly overtook Erik, who struggled against the foes even as they tore him apart. Phineas and William took down the madman in the room they were in while Brother brought revenge down upon the creatures who had killed yet another one of his Inquisitorial allies. Retreating into the room he joined the others as more foes streamed after them. Despite Brother’s arrows and  William’s bombs one broke through and assaulted Phineas leaving a deep gaping wound across his chest before it was brought down. Phineas struggled to hold onto his life while reality blurred around him,. but the injury was too great and he followed Erik and Javert into death. \n\nWhen the last rage zombie was finally dispatched Brother was covered in cuts and injuries and William was nearly out of bombs and healing potions. Both were at their wits end. There was too much death, too many friends and allies lost. Brother rallied the shell shocked William and brought him back with one purpose in mind; find Dr. Cross if he still lived and get out alive. William hollowly agreed while his mind was on the sample of serum 108 which he had stashed in his bag.\n \nThe living half of the party quickly ran up the stairs, ignoring any and all rooms around them and found the director of medicine’s office. Kicking in the door, the time for caution long since passed, they saw Tucker Cross pacing back and forth murmuring to himself. William did his best to coax his former friend to join them in leaving but the Flowren doctor was unresponsive. He was ranting, “Too strong. Too strong to treat. Too strong to kill. The only way to treat is to die. The only way to live is to join them. Join them we must. Join or treat. Join or die.” Brother heard quite enough and knocked the doctor out cold with a punch and hoisted him over his shoulder. Low on health and sanity the trio, one unconscious, made their way back to the entrance. unfortunately they were joined by the other, now undead, half of the party.Furious and distraught Brother hurled Tucker to the ground and unleashed a torrent of arrows at his now mutated and corrupted former allies. William threw his bombs with a grim determination usually given for gallows men. \n\nOver the burning, arrow full bodies of their former friends, the two shoved Tucker into the carriage and returned home to Orlene. During the entire day’s trip neither spoke nor ate nor slept. Entering the Inquisition Temple both looked as haggard and as strung out as the doctor they turned over to interrogation. Brother gave his report to Hierarch Enjolras who informed him that Hierarch Arleza would see that the facility was stripped of all relevant knowledge and purged of contamination himself. Brother only nodded weakly before turning in his resignation from the order. He would instead retreat to a monastery in the mountains and take a vow of silence. William on the other hand rented a room for an indefinite period of time on the outskirts of the city where he obsessed over serum that drove people to madness, seeking his own solitary reprieve from that chaos.

        "text": "And so, the great, recently-formed adventuring order of [Debauchery Tea Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ocq3g/dd_35_introducing_debauchery_tea_party/), having all just met in a wagon on the way to the village of Thorpe to attend the wedding of their mutual friend, the cartographer Seamus, began their legendary set of adventures.\n\nIn the middle of the forest, the wagon stops. The more aware members of the party hear a muffled scream, the pattering of small feet and the soft, high pitched chirping of goblins. After a few moments, Stevie breaks the party’s silence, “Stevie wonder if it would be wise to investigate?”\n\nYrioth agrees and attempts to sneak out of the wagon to investigate. Five goblins – a fairly straightforward encounter for a group of nine (albeit 1st level) characters. The party’s first ever roll was a critical miss, which basically set the tone for the whole encounter. Apart from Rose, Minerva and Prince, everybody fails to hit the goblins and end up getting in the way. Even Turlog (with his cries of TURLOG PUNCH MURDER!!!!!) fails to do anything useful. Many low rolls and facepalms later, the goblins lie dead. Prince grabs the loot and, upon finding an odd, slimy, glowing plant, eats it (come to think of it, Prince was in the habit of eating any strange flora he should happen upon) and plays a victory tune on his harmonica (have I mentioned that Prince’s player really sucks on the harmonica). Yrioth attempts to steal the harmonica, but an abysmal Sleight of Hand check results in Prince slapping Yrioth down to one health and, feeling the effects of eating the plant, pukes on the poor gnome. So began the Debauchery Tea Party tradition of Yrioth having low health and smelling of puke.\n\nAfter a short interlude during which the party attempts to tie Susan to the cart, they finally return to the task at hand and continue the rest of the way to Thorpe. Upon their arrival, the sun having set (Susan resisted), they meet Seamus, who welcomes them to the village, having already booked three rooms in the Dead Duck Inn for them. The wedding is to take place the next day at 2pm. With that in mind, the party purchases their suppers from Fergus Dale (the innkeep) and his daughter Daisy.\n\n•\tTurlog: “Uuuh...errr…ummm…you look…purdy!” (a.k.a. pathetic diplomacy roll)\n\n•\tDaisy: “Um…ok?”\n\n•\tSusan: “Susan suggest pretty lady come with Susan to Susan room!”\n\n•\tDaisy: “Uh…no thanks.”\n\n•\tSusan: “Susan know how to make it sticky!”\n\n•\tDaisy: “That’s disgusting.”\n\n•\tSusan: “Is that a yes Susan hear?”\n\n•\tDaisy: “No!”\n\n•\tPrince: “Young lady, you may touch the beard if you so desire.”\n\n•\tDaisy: “Sure!”\n\n•\tSusan: *begins crying in the corner of the room*\n\nAnd with that, the party retires. In one room sleep those with animals (Turlog and Old One Eye the geriatric wolf, Minerva and her pussy, Bort and his snake), in the other the midgets (Rose, Yrioth, Prince) and in the third, those who are yet to make up their minds (Eldamar, Stevie, Susan). And as the party begins to doze off, accompanied by the sounds of Susan, alone, making it sticky, they cannot help but wonder (especially Stevie), what will happen the next day.\n\n[Part 2 - Speak now or forever hold your peace](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2oqppg/dd_35_debauchery_tea_party_part_2_speak_now_or/)",

City defenses were shored up, weapons were bought and made, grain wine and water were all stored in safe houses. \n\nAnd then...\n\nNothing happened. \n\nNo attack, no retaliation, no warships on the horizon. \n\nFor a while, things were good. *(Since we were doing the Dark Ages, I sped up time between games; PCs would have long term projects they were working on and so between each game session as little as moments or a span of a year might go by.)* And then, the PCs noticed that they were getting far far less traffic across the Adriatic Sea. Since their city was at the mouth of a long valley between high peaks, this was pretty serious. The city could grow most of the food it needed in the surrounding fields supplemented through hunting in the high forest or fishing from the bay, but there were a lot of goods that either came by sea or had to make the longer more arduous journey over the mountains. \n\nJacob was especially tense over this since a lot of his Resources came in via the sea. \n\nIn the meantime, the Mad Monk was actually stirring up trouble in the city under the nose of the Triumvirate. He wasn't directly attacking anyone, but his crazy prophesying in the city streets at dusk and dawn were setting some of the mortals on edge. Too, he'd started to develop a band of loyal followers (a quasi-Herd-cum-Retainer force) who actually listened to his ravings and tried to interpret them.    \nThen... he ran afoul of Jacob.      \n\nIt was something slight. Jacob was a Jew and the Mad Monk was nominally Catholic (his Player didn't have a solid grasp on differences in Christian denominations so his rantings a mix of Reformist zeal and Catholic dogma; it really was kind of crazy). As some supplies started to run short, not only did their followers start to bump heads, the two of them did as well.    \nThe sniping between them at first was minor - refusing to deliver a shipment of candles, tossing a gutted pig through a window, petty insults hurled in the street, small brawls between Retainers.    \n\nAnd then... ships were spotted on the horizon. After several months with no ships arriving in the harbor, ships... big merchant ships... were spotted. But then they blockaded the harbor. The Venetians were back. This time they had demands - they'd be allowed to open a guild, they'd get a controlling interest in part of the harbor fees, they'd offer protection to trade ships coming and going (fighting off pirates and the like). Or... they'd declare the city the haven of pirates and law-breakers and no willing ship would put in to port ever again. \n\nThe city was in a tizzy. The Triumvirate did not want to bow to this foreign intimidation, but the city needed the trade and the port. There was a lot of hemming and hawing and debate back and forth. The Mad Monk railed against the foreigners by night and started to hatch a conspiracy to join them if the Triumvirate refused. He tried to plant some evidence that the conspiracy was Jacob's idea, just in case he himself got caught, but Jacob caught him in the act. There was very nearly a fight over it, but the Mad Monk fled into the city when Jacob went to find Alyce to complain of the Monk's behavior. While Jacob was telling Alyce and Livinia what was going on (Obryn wasn't present for this game night), the Mad Monk was heading down to the port. He found the various stockpiles of wine and spirits that had been laid aside near the docks and had his followers break open the barrels and casks. While the followers were chasing people off the docks with accusations of sin and foretellings of doom, the Mad Monk set the dock and the adjacent buildings on fire. He was about to flee, back into the city (perhaps with the intent of shifting blame) when Jeton and Daniel caught him still holding a torch. The Mad Monk chased them back with the open flame and then walked off into the bay.    \n\nJeton and Daniel assumed he was going to the Venetians and quickly grabbed Paul and Livinia so that the four of them could all give chase along the sea-floor of the bay. They never caught up to the Mad Monk, however. (The Mad Monk's player had another character to bring in, wouldn't you know?)\n\nThe Venetians, seeing the blaze from their ships, headed with all due haste towards the docks. The PCs on land panicked. The ones on the sea-floor were too blinded by silt to tell much of what was going on - though they did find some old stone ruins as well as some sunken ships.      \nThe Venetians, however, were not interested in attacking the city. Quite the opposite; they were scared that what they came for - a viable sea port on the eastern Adriatic - was going up in flames (they didn't want to displease their Master back in Venice with such an abject failure it turns out). So there was a lot of panicking, arming the citizens, and then two sets of people all trying to put out the flames while attempting to defend themselves and their own bucket-lines against attackers in the smoke that didn't exist.      \nThe party in the bay eventually emerged, giving up the search, just in time to find the fires extinguished and Jacob and Mirlinda heartily thanking the Venetian sea captain. \n\nThe next week, when they were explaining all of these events to Obryn (whom it was said was secluded in his Tower up in the mountains during this time), he pointedly asked what they found in the bay. Which really was nothing of import in comparison to the Venetian 'attack'. But he kept pressing the issue, looking at me, looking at them.      \n*See, I had forgotten that Obryn had fleshcrafted a bunch of blood-bound Neonates into an aquatic defense force and chained them in the bay. Aside from Obryn (in part three, linked above), no one else had known about the 'watchers in the bay.' Obryn's player pulls me aside and whispers to me \"what about the childer I put in the bay.' It took me about 45 seconds to realize my mistake. I, however, nodded at Livinia. \"She was in the lead, had the Auspex up. There was a lot of silt in the water, but no chains were found. No bodies to be seen.\"     \nObryn, standing there amidst his fellow Lords of the Long Night, says \"Oh. Poo.\"      \n*(Literally, that's what he said. He was in character, his long fingers steepled before him, glaring at Livinia and the others as she tells him there was no life in the Bay.)*     \nObryn spills the beans. He'd experimented on some captured Venetians, Embraced them, and secreted them in the bay with some aquatic modifications. The fact that five heretofore unknown Kindred had been outside the city was not the alarming fact, but the the fact that they were suddenly irrevocably *gone* and no one knew how, why, or had seen them leave. The immediate suspicion was that the unknown and still unnamed vampire slumbering somewhere in the city had awoken and consumed them wholly. \n\nThe other two members of the Triumvirate privately warned Obryn not to do too much unnecessary 'experimentation' in the future. Little did they know that Obryn had been stashing bodies beneath the tower, experimenting on shaping ghouls to use in what everyone thought was an upcoming war. He'd been pretty wild so far. He even had some of the ground around the Tower 'sown' with Torpid vampires who only needed blood to awaken them (likely in a frenzy) - the idea was that if there was a battle outside the Tower, the spilled blood would soak the ground and the shallowly buried vampires would burst forth in a frenzy of killing and hunger. Obryn didn't tell them any of this, only that he'd seek their counsel in the future. \n\n***\n\nIn the meantime, we needed to bring in a new character for the player of Verik/the Mad Monk. It was getting more and more difficult to introduce new vampires to the city given the paranoid and increasingly antagonistic stance they had towards outsiders.    \nI cautioned everyone on this. Especially the Player in question.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ojlx5/storythe_merciless_wastelands_fallout_3_readable/",
        "text": "Might drone on a bit, but hey, feel free to not read it. Some details are romanticised for the purpose of storytelling. I wrote this all in one go, so apologies if something doesn't make sense somewhere. The quest is named \"Tenpenny Tower\" if you want to refer to an external source. I finished this quest only yesterday.\n\nUpon exiting the RobCo facility after a close shave with a few rogue robots, I spotted an odd highrise in the wastelands closeby, boarded up some, and walled in on all sides. I checked my Pip-boy for the map, and my next quest was far, far away, and this structure was worth investigating, in my opinion.\n\nThe entrance was found after a bit of walking around the wall, and by then a ghoul with his bare flesh hardly covered by his peeling skin, was just leaving the premises. The entrance was closed, and it was apparent that whoever was behind the gate turned the ghoul away. I spoke with the man behind the gates, who then let me into the wall after a quick bribe of 100 caps. I was already feeling uneasy of this place, it reeked of corruption. The quest called \"Tenpenny Tower\" was added to my pip-boy.\n\nThe insides the tower had a homely, warm feel to it, however. Gentle, soft yellow lighting all round, and many residents in shops and their suites, wandering about the lobby and the hallways all making this place feel as lively as possible. However, as I spoke to the residents, they all mentioned one common fear: **the impending invasion of the ghouls.** And I was to speak to their security chief, Chief Gustavo for further details. I tried to speak to the rest of the security guards, but they ignored me, treated me like dirt.\n\nI had encountered ghouls only once before. They were also humans once, who, unfortunately, survived the radiation from the fallout, but with big consequences. From the accounts of the tower residents, their skin started to peel off, with their minds slowly degrading into nothingness, until they are classified as feral. Foolishly, I believed them, and did not raise concerns as to the mysterious ghoul who spoke with the gate guard briefly. At last, I spoke to Chief Gustavo. He revealed that he was the man behind the gates when the ghoul was turned away. He offered to pay me 500 caps if I took care of his little... \"problem\". Chief explained that the ghoul who was turned away had a little following, and they plan to take over the tower sooner or later.\n\n*\"Look kid, eventually all Ghouls go zombie on your ass. It's only a matter of time. Kill them when you find them. It's a win-win. You put them out of their misery, and save someone else from getting torn apart.\"*\n\nThat made sense to me. The argument was convincing, and plus I really could use some caps. I raised the payment to 700 caps through some counter-convincing, as he was reluctant to send any troops to assist me. He sent me on the way with an assault rifle, and promised that the residents will be grateful for what I was about to do.\n\nI reached the quest marker after a few minutes of walk. It was an old, abandoned underground tunnel. A few feral ghouls spotted me from afar and attempted to attack me with bare hands.\n\n*\"Pour things.\"* I thought, as I put them out of their misery, buying into the Chief's speech.\n\nI entered the tunnel, encountering a few more feral ghouls along the way to a train station. By then, I was pretty tense from the scares that a few ghouls had given me when they appeared out of thin air. I spotted a few red markers on my radar, which indicated that enemies were close by. I figured they were the same feral ghouls I'd been euthanising for a while now, and fired at the vague figure visible on the screen. The figure shot back at me, at which point I saw the quest marker indicated that this figure was one of the ghouls that I needed to put down.\n\n*\"A bunch of thieves and liars.\"* I thought as I decapitated Roy Phillips, according to his health meter. I was then deducted of karma, a rating of the good and evil I'd done in the wastelands. I was ruthless but I still maintained a high karma level by generally not being an asshole to fellow friends and strangers.\n\nWhoever Roy Phillips was, good or bad, he attempted to murder me. And I acted in self defense. That was my justification for murdering Roy Phillips.\n\nAs I neared his body, a shot rang past my ear. Another figure was firing at me. He wore a motorcycle helmet. That didn't stop a bullet entering his brain. Another loss of karma. Another follower put down.\n\n*\"Self-defense\"*, I still maintained.\n\nI searched the body of motorcycle helmet wearer first, who went by the name of Michael Masters. He was dressed like any other human, except that he was a ghoul.\n\n*\"So there are some ghouls who aren't feral. Big deal.\"* I reassured myself of my moral ground. *\"Still doing them a favour. And they shot at me.\"*\n\nThe first figure I murdered was named Roy Phillips. He was less properly dressed, however donned armour that was impressive nonetheless.\n\n*\"Wrong place, wrong time.\"* Perhaps if the circumstances were different, these two ghouls wouldn't be dead under my gun.\n\nI continued on with my quest, looking for more hostile followers.\n\nThe last marker led me to a service tunnel, off to the side of the main tracks. I entered with extreme caution, fully aware of the potential deadly traps that could be waiting for me inside. This was their hideout, their last stronghold. The last marker was around the corner.\n\nI turned the corner, expecting an army of a hundred ghouls with their guns at the ready. Instead, the quest marker pointed to a bed. A woman slept on the bed. She was a ghoul, but she still had features which identified her as a female. I decided to wake her up. After all, she couldn't be the last \"follower\". There had to be more.\n\nBessie, her name was. She woke up, and was terrified at first. However, I decided to coax her into telling me where the rest were hiding. We chatted for a bit, and I learned that she had a boyfriend. His name was Roy Phillips, and he was the leader of their little \"following\". I felt sudden guilt, and promised not to kill her. She was still oblivious to the fact that the weapon murdering her boyfriend was still smoking, strapped behind my back. She thought of me as a friend.\n\nI walked about, leaving Bessie to sleep once again. There were no hidden rooms, no tunnels, nothing. The quest marker still pointed to Bessie but she droned on about how beautiful she once was. She wouldn't talk about the other followers.\n\nI checked my quest again. \"Kill Roy and the other ghouls.\" Where are these \"other ghouls\"? Then it dawned upon me.\n\nI went back to Bessie. She was still sound asleep, assured of the fact that she would roam the wastelands one day, with Roy at her side. I had to do it.\n\nI sliced her throat. She woke for a brief moment, staring into my soul, questioning my own moral judgement.\n\nShe was dead. The quest was fulfilled. She was the last follower.\n\nI turned my back on the tunnels, never looking back again. The Chief congratulated me upon my return to the tower, giving me my payment of 700 caps. I spent it restocking my ammunition. The ammunition I wasted on murdering those ghouls. The residents all congratulated me on my success, and me \"solving their problem\". The guards all treated me with respect, giving me a firm nod as I walk past.\n\nIt was unjust. But it was the way of the wastelands. The loss of karma from the murders hardly impacted on all the other good things I did. Disarming a nuclear bomb in a town. Helping rejects from the cities. Donating to the church. I continued to try to be as fair and good as possible. But this unjust I'll forever remember.",

        "text": "I haven't played DnD for more than a couple months, but I still feel like I have to share half the things that happen in game. This is one of the more memorable moments.\n\nSo our party has cleared a room after 20 minutes of fast turns and clutch rolls. It's a small bed chamber for a cult of sand people, the Sand Sharks. The ranger/merchant of our party is going through and looting chests and bodies while the rest of us get our medicine checks on. He comes across a chest with a lock on it and just bashes it open since its a wooden chest. We only had a day and a half to save our friends before the corrupt politician became leader of the Frozen Sands, so we were a bit pressed on time. Lo and behold, the chest bleeds and screams, and shortly thereafter curls on the floor to die. \n\nMimics aren't a big deal. I've played Dark Souls before, so I already had that stupid mentality of hitting chests before opening them. Inside the now rotting mimic was... (the DM had to think for a few seconds.) A small red ruby that could be sold for quite a few gold pieces, a small sword of little importance, and a croissant. But not a normal croissant, its was a *crisp, fresh out of the oven* croissant.\n\nOur ranger decided to take a bite. How could you not? It sounded delicious. As the croissant met with the ranger's lips he tasted \"the most delicious and savory food of his life.\" At this point, we had been surviving off of hardtack and the like for a week, so being the lawful good person he is, the ranger split the croissant into equal bites for everyone. We were all eager to take a bite of such a tasty croissant, but the DM made sure that everyone was sure they wanted to eat it before they did. And we all felt sure.\n\nAt this point the DM sighs, and mutters, *\"shouldn't have done that...\"*\n\nWe all licked our lips and wondered the DM seemed so sullen. Then the cracking noise was heard. Small rocks fell from the ceiling and the walls. There was a deafening blast, and everyone lost vision. When we recovered we saw 1, just 1, ancient undead. He wore a chef's hat, and by the way he was holding his meat cleaver, I could tell he didn't like the pastry indulging. After a few relentless bashes to the head, our Warlock rolled to take the recipe for the croissant. The DM made it pretty clear that the only thing that this undead was wearing was the hat, and there wasn't any real good hiding spots for a *recipe*. \n\n\nOf course, **nat fucking 20**.\n\n\nThe DM, a real nice guy, decide that this 20 shouldn't go to waste despite the lack of a recipe. He says \"The Fiend of *Warlock* saps the recipe from the mind of the undead.\" **It would be real nice if anyone could cook, *or if our Warlock knew how to read*.**\n\npls be gentle ^^this ^^is ^^my ^^first ^^story",

        "text": "The year is sometime conveniently just ahead of the present day to justify slight futuretech but close enough to be recognizable. The timeline is one in which Canada made America its bitch and went on to become a bastion of badassery throughout the 20th century. The plot is that demons are doing demonic shit, and a paramilitary of task force of soldiers with Faustian pacts has been assembled to save the world. And what a band of maniacs we are:\n\n1. Jo Longstreet - Team telepath, wrench wench, and unacknowledged voice of reason. Prefers the subtle art of using a laser drill as a precision cutting weapon. \n2. Shawn Fergis - Team demo guy and hockey enthusiast. Wields an \"all natural Canadian redwood\" hockey stick and a bandolier of hockey-puck-shaped explosives.\n3. Hayden Vaughn - Team techie. Gets bored easily, makes good use of his brain sometimes when it's important.\n4. Professor Translonny - Team clairvoyant. A hermaphroditic European aristocrat with glitter grenades and a .22 pistol. Conveniently tells us if we're about to fuck up majorly. Part time gospel preacher.\n5. Allen Fucking Churchill - Team assault and gloryhound. Obsessed with outdoing his hero ancestors - dad saved the Queen more times than James Bond, and grandad killed Hitler with a broadsword. Yeah, grandad was [Jack Churchill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Churchill#Capture_.281944.29). \n\nOur system is FATE fudge. Ho boy.\n\nThe adventure begins with one of Her Majesty's Demon Slayers outside of Halifax City Hall. One of the service's psychics had predicted the hall would be burned down by demon activity, so the team was dispatched to investigate. How do you begin investigating a case of arson that hasn't occurred yet?\n\nWell, Captain Jack Churchill was a bit of a gloryhound. And by gloryhound, I mean he'd be the type of guy to push a teammate out of the way of an explosion so that they wouldn't die a heroic death and upstage him. A combination of 'roid rage, adrenaline, and sheer, unadulterated enthusiasm led to him taking the first action of the night - grabbing the nearest team members by the collar, sprinting forward, and kicking in the front door with guns blazing. This also led to the first combat of the night - the doors slammed open to reveal a demon in a smoke form.\n\nGunfire was ineffective, and the cloud of smoke enveloped Churchill. Seeing his Captain in danger, Fergis lunged forward, hoping to push his comrade free of the attack - only to be stiff-armed by Churchill, since getting his ass saved by a lackey wouldn't look good in the aftermath report. In doing so, his audacity shocks the demon just as much as it shocks the DM, leaving it stunned - which Churchill immediately takes advantage of. He drops to his back, shoves hard against the floor, and slides backwards across the waxed marble. From his vest, he pulls a flare and a can of aersolized thermite - the flare he ignites, the thermite he sprays, and the result is a fireball that'd make Michael Bay weep in shame.\n\nAnd now, we've been playing for five minutes.\n\nThe rest of the team runs inside, and immediately encounters another demon, a minotaur of shadow.  Bullets fly, and the demon dodges - it's clairvoyant, and is practically plucking the bullets out of the air. Fergis throws a grenade, but he only manages to topple a wall. Vaughn throws a canister of knockout gas, only to have the demon snatch it from the air, throw it back, and bean the poor nerd like a far-sighted little league catcher. Churchill, up to this point, has been gloating his annihilation of the smoke demon, but he turns around to see his team *stealing his glory.*\n\nThis will not do. Churchill draws his grandfather's broadsword. The demon is clairvoyant. It braces for attack - and is taken back in surprise as Churchill charges with a medieval blade. The action is so audacious that the *future-seeing abomination* is caught off guard - the attack immediately decapitates it.\n\nThe game has been going for ten minutes.\n\nFollowing this, the team is kinda stuck for options. We'd killed the demons, so now what? Our gender-bent faux-royal casts forth with her mind, and can detect the presence of a great evil in the basement of the building. Our technologist, in a stroke of genius, begins a search for the schematics of the building - and immediately gets bored and gives up. Thankfully, though, we  have a stroke of genius - the evil is straight down, and the floor can't be *that* thick, right?\n\n Longstreet pulls out the laser drill. Fergis pulls out the C4.\n\nWhen the deed is done, Translonny cries out in warning: due to imprecision in shaping the charges, if we try to blow a shaped hole in the floor we will only succeed in blowing away the *entire* floor, killing everyone in the process. Unfortunately, we've still negated to look for the stairs, and our course is set - stairs are for people who aren't demon slayers. Churchill looks to the heavens - and sees a chandelier. A few minutes later sees Churchill, Vaughn, and Fergis dangling from rappelling lines far above the floor, detonators and grenades in hand, with Longstreet and Translonny cowering behind cover nearby.\n\nOn the count of 1, the grenade pins drop. On the count of 3, the floor explodes and the grenades drop. On the count of 5, the *team* drops. After that, well, things get a little fuzzy - Translonny is on fire, Vaughn is clutching leg, Fergis is rubbing his head where Vaughn landed on him, and Churchill is completely deaf. Since jumping down a gaping hole in the floor isn't much to their style, the psychics *find* the stairs and begrudgingly use them. Soon, the team is reunited. Except they aren't, because *dopplegangers.*\n\nThe team thinks for a moment, and cooler heads prevail - except Churchill, because his head is so hot you could run a steam plant off of it. Seeing no danger, he stops to reload his weapons as Vaughn and Fergis stumble into combat - and, being preoccupied as he is with proper magazine placement, he fails to notice when one of the demons dissolves on death. Confused, he comes over, asking where Translonny disappeared to - only for the other doppleganger to slip behind him and slash out with black claws. Noticing this movement, Churchill thinks his \"trusted teammate\" has actually spotted a demon in the darkness behind them - he whirls around, rifle in hand, and since he's holding it with one hand with a flare in the other he smacks the demon in the face - it contorts and twists with the blow like putty.\n\nChurchill again rolls to see if he realizes that it's a doppleganger. He rolls a critical failure, with full negative fudge dice. Rather than realizing the reality of the situation, he grabs \"Longstreet\" by the shoulders and begins to profusely apologize for bashing her across the face with an AR-15. The demon rears back for another attack...\n\nAnd disappears, as Fergis, hockey stick in hand, roundhouses Churchill out of the way and slapshots the demon across the room. The sheer force of the blow is enough to reduce the demon to ichor, which flies across the room and coats the *other* unfortunate members of the party, the psychics - who immediately realize that they, too, are up against dopplegangers. A scuffle ensues - Translonny throws a grenade into the fray, mangling one and vaporizing another. The third charges forward, pinning Longstreet to the ground - Translonny tries, and fails, to drive her heels into the demon, succeeding only in nearly killing Longstreet.\n\nChurchill *still* hasn't realized what's going on, but as soon as Translonny pulls a gun in desperation, it clicks - because, gloryhound that he is, he can tell that *someone besides him is about to save the day.*\n\nTime slows. Churchill grips his sword. A sound like a cracking whip is heard in the room, and the demon strangling Longstreet is replaced by a cloud of blood. The bullet fired by Translonny, or rather the halves it has been split into, ricochet harmlessly to either side of Longstreet's head. On the other side of the room, Churchill sheathes his sword.\n\nIn the background, the A-team theme starts playing. Mainly because Fergis, wanting to go home, has just set explosives to level the building without asking, and set a timer in real-time for *three minutes.* Translonny passes out, and Churchill slings him over his shoulder as the team sprints for the exit.\n\nUnfortunately, there's a demon at the top of the stairs. *Again.*\n\nChurchill opens fire - no effect. He drops his rifle and draws his pistol - no effect. Vaughn and Fergis open fire, no-oh, wait, the building **explodes under their feet.** Most of the team is badly injured in the blast, only barely avoiding death. Churchill and Translonny are nowhere to be found - Churchill does not dodge the explosion.\n\n**He rides it.**\n\nSword in hand, Translonny slung over his back, and concrete surfboard under his feet, he flies through the air like the majestic Canadian he was meant to be. [Reenactment was required.](http://www.imgur.com/VqqC1k8)\n\nBut, now, how to get down?\n\nHe rolls a 7 on a Flashiness check. *Parachute.*\n\n---\n\nThis game might be a *little* bit stupid, but my god did we have fun.\n\n",

        "text": "Part [One](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2o6g73/vampire_the_dark_ages_blood_sweat_and_tears/) and Part [Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2oa01o/vda_blood_sweat_and_tears_savage_loss/) \n\n***\n\nSo, in the space of perhaps two or three game nights, we'd lost one PC permanently (Verik) as well as another who would later come back under the same name and background, but as a werewolf (Saban). \n\nVerik was replaced by a PC I can only remember as 'the Mad Monk' - he was a Malkavian, he was a monk, and he wandered into town the week after Verik's disappearance.    \n\nIn no time at all, the Triumvirate impressed upon him that they were the ruling power, that he was fine to stay, but in addition to keeping hidden from the mortals (lest a new Crusade arise), it was also forbidden to attack any other Vampire in the city without the permission of the Triumvirate.      \nThe Mad Monk agreed to his and set about moving into the catacombs beneath the partially burned Catholic Church (see part two). \n\nAs the PCs went about their business - keeping those villains who had been pursuing the strangers on the move as well as keeping the strangers allies away - the Mad Monk started to try to build up some influence in the city.      \nHe wasn't very good at it. \n\nIt's not that the player didn't have some decent ideas, it's not that the character concept didn't entirely lend itself towards it (it kind of worked in game); no, it was that every time he tried to sway someone to his opinion, he'd roll really really *really* poorly.      \nThe player didn't blame the dice, though. No. The character blamed the Triumvirate and their blasphemous hold on the city's people. \n\nMeanwhile, the city was approached by an outside group - merchants from far off Venice. However, these merchants were the ghouled servants of a cabal of Vampires. The PCs were worried about their presence and not entirely convinced by their promises of lucrative trade routes. \n\nDuring the night, one of the two ships the Venetian merchants came in caught fire and sank the city's harbor. A tragedy.      \nIn the chaos and confusion, Obryn had several of the Venetian sailors abducted. It would be assumed that they drowned when the ship went down. However, the Tyrant's hand was suspected in not only the abduction, but the fire as well. Obryn's capture of these poor souls would be slightly important later on - they became a sort of long term project for his experimentation with Vicissitude. Eventually (out of game, months later; in-game I think it took the better part of a year), after Blood Bonding them all, he would shape their flesh and bones to make them into aquatic vampiric childer. He'd take those childer and chain them to the bottom of the harbor in the city - being vampires, they wouldn't need to breathe. They could eat aqautic life to survive and/or feast on bodies sunk in the bay. He did this behind the back of the other members of the Triumvirate, but had some help from Paul and Jacob.      \nThe Venetians who were left made haste to leave town. \n\nWhen the Venetians left town, the City's vampires were happy to be rid of them; however they'd soon discover that the Venetians had taken several people hostage and spirited them away aboard the departing ship - including two Kindred, the new Mad Monk and Daniel.      \nThe Mad Monk and Daniel awoke in a wooden cell. They'd been taken during daylight hours (along with a pair of ghouls who were in another room and a pair of random townsfolks in yet another room). It actually took the Monk and Daniel several minutes to figure out that they were in a locked wooden room below the water-line of a large sailing ship. To their credit, they didn't just try to force the door and fight they way to the deck of the ship.    \nNo. No, instead the Monk convinced Daniel to instead tear a hole in the wooden wall of the ship so that they could then swim out into the sea.    \nDaniel actually started this and got the start of a hole made, seawater flowing in, when he went \"Wait. What the hell am I doing? The force of the water will pin us in this room and all the innocents aboard the ship will drown and die.\" And then he tried to plug the hole with the measly bedding and cloth that was in the room.     \n\nUnbeknownst to the pair of them, they were being pursued by several smaller ships from the city filled with sailors, armed men, and a few angry Vampires. This led to a big, set-piece naval battle in the Adriatic, with the Venetian heavy merchant ship and three, much smaller, fishermen's boats. \n\nThe battle wasn't very decisive. While the PCs were able to rescue the Mad Monk and Daniel, the Venetian merchant ship got away (it had been joined by another vessel that did have armed guards aboard - arrows are nasty if you're a vampire). The Venetians were sure to become enemies and the PCs didn't even have a face to put to them, only the name of a powerful family: *Giovanni.* \n\n\n",

If anyone was willing to help flesh it out, I'd gladly play that, but it seems a bit impractical right now. So, does anyone know any free tabletop RPGs anywhere? (Pirating *whatever RPG here* is not an acceptable solution.) Thanks in advance, and if this works, I'll be sure to get something up here in return for help. :)\n\nEDIT: Okay, so I've got links to rules for Pathfinder and DnD, which is good. Would anyone be willing to play a game over the internet somehow? I could probably use a forum page on Wikia or something, but if anyone has any better solutions, let me know. :)\n\nEDIT whatever: Using Roll20, since it looks best. Since that seems to be sorted, I'll need someone willing to be the GM. I've had a think on how to go about it- I'll need a GM that can act as a mentor OOC and play as a mentor figure IC. Post something if you'd like to GM, and I'll get to work on helping get a game up and running. I've already got my planned character class and rough backstory sorted (though not race or stats).

We had spent about 30 minutes before we got onto the main session looking for a place to stay and not get found by the local PD. At about that time the DM thought it'd be fun to throw the catholic church against us. Soooo we found out about a local sect of witch hunters. I thought it'd be easy to just try to make friends with them, seeing as this was my first time ever to play OWoD, I had no idea how fanatical they could get. So To start off the parade of mistakes we had that night.... I walk into a church covered in ash.\n\n\"H-Help me father I-I just.... I just murdered some one.\" I stammered out as I approached the priest. My character, being a devout catholic, had requested a moment alone with the priest. I got the moment... and immediately had a gun pointed to my head as a group of witch hunters dragged me off toward a car. Astares, already in our car, watched as I was dragged away from the church with bag over my head and shoved into a vehicle. Soooo Astares gets in a car chase in which another witch hunter joined up and smashed into our car with a semi, totalling our car and leaving him behind. Thankfully though he was able to find me soon afterward.\n\nI got tossed into an interrogation room where they started to ask what kind of supernatural I was, who did I work for, etc etc when suddenly Astares burst into the room and shot the two fuckers interrogating me. He breaks me free and we head over to the next room to see what we can find, which turned out to be a dissection room with a thrall on the table groaning with his innards exposed to the air. There was also a woman in a cage. While I was trying to heal the thrall the woman looked at me and said to let her out. Astares had ran off about this time.... And main rule of thumb for any party..... NEVER SPLIT IT\n\nAstares had found a nice set of double doors which were locked with a simple lock. He chuckled and kicked the door open as he yelled out \"RISE AND SHINE!\" The dm stopped the game for a moment and started laughing for a moment before going serious. \"You kick the door open to see 13 witch hunters in the same room. As you say your line, rather than saying Shine, you yell SHIIIIIIIIIIIT. Gedderick, you hear this. What do you do.\" Annnnd then I release the woman in the cage... who turned out to be a demon. She shifted form and bumrushed the witchhunters while Gedd followed with his shotgun in tow. We start combat and the combat ends with 13 dead witch hunters, Astares at -7 [Not dead mind you, just bleeding out] Gedd at -6, and our demon friend splattered all over the floor. Our DM had a main boss planned this run, but with how bad we were hurting we just ran for it... well.... dragged for it.",

The group, along with the village elders and the sergeant of the scouts, hold a council of war to determine their next course of action. Brother sent his messenger pigeon to the inform the army of the invasion force, though it would likely be several days until any force could be mustered to aid them. Freemont was obviously indefensible given the number of civilians and the terrain. Javert was of the opinion of continuing the evacuation to the next village until the army could respond. Brother and William however pointed out the infeasibility of this plan, instead suggesting that they take the fight to the invaders. If they staged an ambush at the previous trading post, leaving behind the villagers to spread the message to the surrounding area in case they failed, there might be a chance to head off the invasion before more people came to harm. Ultimately the party decided that this was the best course of action and made the trip back, accompanied by the scouts and a few able bodied villagers. \n\nThe trading post was basically a clearing in the woods where a number of buildings were grouped into a loose circle around a central point. William took the time to lay proximity mines at each of the major entrances while the party arranged themselves on the roofs of the smaller buildings, or the second floor of the two larger ones. The Sergeant organized 3 teams of two men to scout the perimeter to give early warning while the others were arranged as auxiliaries to the party. \n\nA day passed with no action. Early the next morning Brother’s pidgeon returned bearing the message from the Lord Commander of the Regional Guard saying that a battalion was dispatched to Ft. Kinmouth to retake it and would reach it in a little over two days. Brother replied asking for a contingent of soldiers to be sent to their position in case they arrived before attack. Unfortunately this was not to be the case. As dusk fell on the second night two of the scouts returned reporting enemy movement to the south. The defenders watched the woods and waiting for the hammer to fall. The forest rustled with movement and the scouts readied their bows. The party buffed themselves with whatever skills and equipment they had. The rustling stopped and silence descended over the clearing… Then nets launched from the darkness between the trees, entangling a number of the scouts on the closest building.\n\n As they tried to free themselves two mechanical hounds burst into the clearing, setting off some of the mines. The shrapnel and flames engulfed the hounds as even more mechanical men charged into the open. Some scouts were dragged off the roofs into the woods, clawing at the nets that held them. Brother and the Sergeant shot a volley of arrows into the attackers, hoping to free their comrades, and though many of the men fell to arrows many scouts still disappeared into the forest. Joining the fight William launched bombs into the clustered automatons with measured success. That is until one bomb slipped from his grip and exploded behind him, engulfing not only the alchemist but the building as well in flames.\n\nJavert was taking potshots at the mechanical men with his crossbow when he noticed a larger shape coming from the north. Into the fray burst the mechanical scorpion and its barbarian rider flanked by two more mechanical soldiers. In response Javert made an illusory image of Brother, hoping to bait the new enemies into triggering another set of mines. Though he was successful with the two lesser automaton the scorpion launched a harpoon from its tail into the building where he and Brother were stationed and attempted to bring it down.  \n\nMeanwhile Phineas was waiting for a chance to steam one of the downed automatons for inspection when he noticed the smell of smoke. William confirmed the fire when he ran into the main room where Phineas was waiting, himself still in flames. \nPhineas stared at his flammable friend who sheepishly said, “Ummm, the building is on fire Phineas.”\n“You don’t say?”\n“I had nothing to do with that…”\n“I suppose I have reason to doubt that.” William shrugged and muttered, “no time to put it out now,” and ran out the back door to flank the attackers. Phineas ran out the main entrance noticing the barbarian notice him as he ran around to the other building that housed Javert and Brother.  The barbarian leaped off his mount in pursuit of the Ochremarken Engineer roaring.\n\nBrother took a break from raining down death and decommission on the automatons to launch a series of arrows at the Scaldval warrior, one of which found purchase in his side, but did little to slow him down. Perhaps he should have paid more attention to the scorpion which succeeded this time in taking down the building with his harpoon shot. Brother managed to remain surefooted on the roof, though Javert was less skillful and fell two stories and was half buried in rubble and debris. \n\nPhineas continued to retreat expeditiously from the enraged warrior chasing him down and with an intense burst of speed he returned to William who was busy turning a group of automaton to scrap, despite still being on fire.\n\nJavert decided to for a death or glory assault on the scorpion and managed to clammer aboard the mechanical monster’s back.  Unfortunately he came down with a terrible case of “too stupid to live” and was impaled by its tail. His last words couldn’t be heard of the din of the battle but they were, “I did it… for the… log!”\n\nBrother himself could do nothing to help his friend as he was face to face with an angry barbarian who, deprived of his initial prey, turned to the closest one. With a bellow he swung his massive warhammer catching brother in the side, cracking ribs and damaging internal organs. Half dead, Brother launched a final all or nothing volley at point blank range into the warrior, bringing him to his knees, his rampage temporarily abated. In an Apollonian effort Brother turned his sight to the scorpion now stalking his remaining comrades who were badly wounded from their own, though successful, skirmishes. Releasing 3 arrows, two found critical junctures, one in a leg piston and the other in the spine causing the machine to overload and collapse. William stood before the felled beast and cheered, then promptly sucumbed to his burns and passed out.\n\nThe battle was won, though not without cost. The scouts, along with their Sergeant, as well as the villagers were all either dead or captured. Phineas revived William, though there was nothing that could be done for Javert. Brother’s rage and grief were only contained by his intense moral code. With a boot on the barbarian’s neck and an arrow notched and pointed at his head Brother had Phineas and WIlliam tie him up. In the meantime the party gathered their dead and respectfully laid them out. Phineas and William also took to collecting the bodies of the automata and assembled a full one, though deconstructed. Examining the machines they found it to be a remarkable piece of engineering, with nearly identical structures as humans. The skeleton was wholly comprised of bronzed metal alloy which a sophisticated system of pumps, gears, and hinges, fed by an oil circulatory system provided motion. In the back of the chest was a welded panel, which, once opened, housed a marble sized fragment of crystal; the same crystal that was being mined in Roanne. The scorpion had a similar panel and housed a much larger crystal, similar to the excavated hole in Roanne. \n\nWhen the barbarian regained consciousness Phineas led the interrogation. He refused to respond, if he could, in any language other than Scaldvalish, which was probably for the best since Brother could not understand his responses. The only information that the party could get out of him was that he was named Belial and that the automata were gifts from his Master. Phineas assumed that by Master he meant the witch from before, though Belial showed amusement when Phineas referred to the Master a “her.” The party could glean no understanding of a motive for the attacks, nor any future plots or attacks. When the army finally arrived late that evening Belial was given to their custody while the party was commended for their actions and instructed to meet the Agent of the Inquisition at Ft. Kinmouth. For now the crisis was over.",

        "text": "Character profiles and backstories are [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2o32j0/rogue_trader_a_collection_of_short_stories_from/).\n\nThe TL;DR is Orks are gathering a WAAAAGH! to attack Terra.\n\nAlso, something I noticed I didn't mention in the last story but I think I let drop a little in the comments, Dok Zagbar is my character.\n___\n\n**Waagor's Pet Squiggoth**\n\nWe were visiting a jungle planet with a bunch of Feral Orks on it. Kaptin Gazbag figured that Feral Orks are \"right sneaky\", and we'd be needing them to take Terra. Waagor's player was late to the session, so we left him on the ship to \"find those zoggin' 'Eadbiters\". Everyone else goes into the Feral Ork camp to negotiate with them, which involves beating up their Warboss, impressing them with our technology, and Maggrim entering in a squig eating competition.\n\nAnyway, we take a meal break and when we return to the session, the GM informs us that the ferals are all of a sudden furious with us, and are amassing a mob to take us down. Unfortunately, this is AFTER we'd fitted them all with proper equipment, so we decide to leg it.\n\n**Kaptin:** \"LEG IT BOYS! WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!\"\n\nThe cargo area of our ship is already open, so we run inside, to find ourselves face to face with a Squiggoth. Maggrim lets out a battlecry and charges it, before being stopped by a shout from its back. SOMEHOW, Waagor managed to climb onto the thing and make it accept him. Runtherdy animal handling bullshit god rolls.\n\nWe later learned that when Waagor arrived at the game (maybe about an hour before meal break), the GM told him \"the party is to far gone for you to reasonably catch up with him. During meal break, speak to me about what you want to do.\"\n\nHe spent the entire time breaking into their camp, killing their runtherds, and stealing their Squiggoth.\n\n**Waagor:** \"OI! MAGGRIM! YOU GET ONE STEP CLOSA AND I'LL LET OL' STOMPY HERE... STOMP YA!\"\n\nWaagor hopped down from the beast and told us his story. The Kaptin would have shot him, if not for the giant green beast roughly the size of a tank that only listens to Waagor. As much as we would have loved a pet squiggoth, it was much to difficult to keep it, so the rest of the party started devising a plan to dispose of it.\n\nFirst, we had Waagor put it to sleep. Then Zagbar and Zapstrak set to work [\"adding more DAKKA\"](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/mediawiki/images/c/c6/Big_Squiggoth.jpg), much to Waagor's disappointment. With that done, we found the nearest human planet, fitted the Squiggoth with a giant parachute, flew over the top of a major hive, and dropped the Squiggoth on it. The Squiggoth was manned by 5 gretchin, and carried about 100 boys. We didn't really care what happened, we just thought it was funny.\n\nAlso, I only realised this after having wrote it. Yes, I realise there is not enough space on a smallish squiggoth for 100 boys, weapons, and a crew of gretchin. The boys hung onto the armour plating. We lost about 30 in the drop.\n___\n\n**Negoshiashun**\n\nContrary to popular belief, Imperial Guardsmen, especially the cowardly ones, are willing to negotiate with Orks, and even more surprisingly, the Kaptin was willing to keep his word. We (as in the entire krew of our ship, approximately 120,000 Orks at this point) went on a massive rampage across some sort of Imperial Guard outpost planet. While the boyz went around killing the masses of guardsmen, we busied ourselves taking our important locations, and killing commanders. \n\nEventually we get hailed by Commissar Severus Titanius, offering to negotiate with us. We let him know we'd meet him in an hour. We spend this hour fixing our weapons, taking count of the boys, gathering any spores we could find, and fixing our wounded. One of those wounded was Zapstrak. Unfortunately, Zagbar was lacking the time (nor did he really care) to properly fix up the Mek, so he just pumped him full of fightin' juice, took a few teef, then threw him out.\n\nGazbag noticed that Zapstrak seemed a little \"on edge\" as he put it, so he made the wise decision to lock Zapstrak in the ship. What he forgot, was that Zapstrak is a Mek, and leaving him in a locked room with all of his tools is stupid. Zapstrak broke out of that room, got his Trukk, and drove ahead of us to the meeting. He actually drove past us on the way, and shot Gazbag in the foot. When we arrive, we arrive to a horror show. Zapstrak has somehow blown up his trukk, stolen a leman russ battle tank, and gone batshit insane, killing all the Imperial Guard, including the Commissar, and making huge craters in the ground. We were going to negotiate for explosives to make a mega bomb to drop on the next planet, but we walked away with a new tank, so we were pretty happy.\n\n___\n\n**Facebiter Nob**\n\nShort story. Zagbar dragged a decapitated Ork back from a battlefield and attached a Squig to the stump where his head used to be. Once the Orksquig woke up, it immediately attacked Zagbar, who retaliated by shooting it with his handy \"Zappa Kannon\". He then fitted it with a power klaw and put it in Gazbag's room.\n\n___\n\n**List of Zapstrak's inventions**\n\nDa Zappa Kannon: An extremely powerful taser that can knock most creatures out in a single shot. Unfortunately, it's to heavy to carry about, so we keep one on the bridge, one in Zapstrak's lab, and one in Zagbar's shop. Maggrim could probably carry it, but he can't use firearms, as he has no hands. Zagbar replaced them with Power Klaws.\n\nDa Shooty Hurty Drivamajigger: A modified to hell Trukk. Fitted with 3 big shootas, a rear mounted Zappa Kannon, a wrecking ball, and enough space for 10 boys. Destroyed by Zapstrak during his rampage.\n\nBoyapult: Really just a highly technologically advanced catapult. With advanced aiming technology we stole from some Tau, some Orky knowwots, and a lot of wishful thinking, this weapon can sometimes reliably shoot Orks roughly where they might want to go... maybe. Broke after we attempted to launch a sleeping Maggrim. He was too heavy. That day we learned that if you have to use a crane to lift something, you probably shouldn't put it in the ramshackle catapult.\n\nRokkit Powered Boyz: In collaboration with Zagbar, Zapstrak created a \"rokkit powered klaw\" that launched the boy backwards, leaving the klaw to fall to the dirt. We have no idea WHY Zapstrak wanted to make this, but Zagbar thought it would be funny, so he went along with it.\n\nOrkital Drop Pods: Zapstrak felt that Roks \"don't gots enough dakka\", so he built the first Ork Orbital Drop Pod. Inside it featured 4 kustom mega blastas, and a roof mounted Shokk Attack Gun, with a supply of about 10 gretchins stuffed into a small compartment in the roof for ammo. Most of them blew up the first time we dropped them, causing a massive hole in the warp because of those Shokk Attack Guns, making daemons pour through, much to our delight.",

        "text": "This is a tale from the final session of the inaugural five-session campaign of my very own RPG, Straight to VHS, which is centered on the following theme: Bad Movies.\n\n\nI won't bore you with much about the events that lead up to our tale, though this means we'll be skipping over Hombre De Espacio, the raid at the sperm bank, psychic operation of a motorcycle in order to distract a van full of ninjas and. . . well, much else. . . But we're here for the humiliating death of Theodore Albright. I must warn you, the nature of this story may cause distress in those of delicate sensibilities or weak constitution. It is. . . not proper.\n\n\nFirst, we must know who Theodore is. He was a PC played in sessions 2, 3 and four. He was a beautiful, drug-dealing surfer dude who was dumb as a rock and who had earned the ire of fellow PC Ivy Proudmore (a Pam Grier-esque character who is amazingly caucasian) by his being a hippie, a nitwit and for selling a ton of weed to Ivy's up-until-recently estranged space-vampire father.\n\n\nYou all with me? Good.\n\n\nSo, as these thing tend to go, session four ends with everyone stowing away on the \"sperm-zombie\" sarcophagi which are being loaded into the Valopian mothership. With Theodore's player having moved between session four and five, it's explained that his sarcophagi was loaded into a different room, along with that of Ivy's father (and another NPC who I'll leave out for brevity). After learning how to wrest navigational control of the ship with some help from the Flerjervtlinblerks (oh yeah, Penelope learned that she's half Flerdjervtlinblerkish, which really explains her psychic powers), the PCs end up on the navigation deck where they have a showdown with the Valopian leaders. The PCs are victorious and they unlock the navigational controls so that they may send the ship crashing into the moon, ending it all. But before they can celebrate. . . \n\n\nA slow clap is heard. It's Ivy's recently unestranged space vampire father. . . turns out the PCs have been used (as tends to happen). Now he can claim the ship as his own. . . and there. . . at his side. . . it's Theodore, though he looks to have been recently turned into a space vampire thrall.\n\n\nAnd so the actual final showdown commences. It's great. And I'm surprised when the father is the first to fall, leaving Theo as the very final baddie. Ivy attacks. . . and gets a critical hit! She has a choice of effect. She chooses. Oh my. . . Theo's penis is shot clean off of his body, fair readers. I warned you, didn't I? Yes, quite cruel of Ivy, but you must remember that she never liked Theo and now he was trying to kill her and all. It should be said that Theodore was clinging to life by a fingernail.\n\n\nTheo's turn came next. He goes for Ivy and. . . gets a critical failure! There's only one thing for it ladies and gentlemen, I steeled myself for the narration that the dice had laid before me. Ivy had shot off his dick and in pain-soaked fury he goes to lunge at Ivy only to slip upon his own dismembered pud and fall forward, his mouth wrapping around Ivy's gun. \n\n\nIn a roar, hands held aloft, the other players defer their turns to Ivy who tells the vampire to \"suck on this\" before granting her lead mercy upon him.\n\nKlaxons herald the imminent crash into the surface of the moon and a mad dash is made for the escape pods. From their capsules they watch it all shatter in unspeakable spectacle as the campaign comes to a close. We had all bore witness to much at that table, but among it all, rest assured that Theo will be remembered. . . though perhaps not as he would like to be.\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ocq3g/dd_35_introducing_debauchery_tea_party/",
        "text": "It’s the end of the school year and what better way to celebrate than with a good ol’ game of D&amp;D. Originally the group was to be me (the DM) and four other friends. Before the first session had even begun, this group had expanded to **9 players + DM**. Apparently I’m that popular…\nAnd so, after a long final assembly, we journeyed home to begin our first session. We agreed on D&amp;D 3.5 and the party began rolling up their characters. The result was the great adventuring order of Debauchery Tea Party, consisting of:\n\n•\t**Prince** – the charismatic dwarven bard with max ranks in Perform (Beard). Merely by stroking his luscious beard, Prince is able to seduce, fascinate or impress his targets, and through his magnificent facial hair can even cast his bardic magic. Failing that, he also had a few ranks in Perform (Wind), which of course meant his harmonica (I gave him my harmonica to use during the course of the adventure). Prince quickly emerged as the party leader.\n\n•\t**Bartholomew** (a.k.a **Bort**) – the elven druid with a pet snake. Bort is famous for his…unorthodox approach to druidism, such as his attempts to cleanse racism from the forest (with fire). Nevertheless, Bort was an integral part of the party, being one of the few party members capable of healing.\n\n•\t**Minerva** – the human sorceress, one of two female characters, with her pet pussycat. Minerva was born into a noble family and has been brought up to expect nothing but the best. Spending hard earned loot on excessive amounts of jewellery, refusing to sleep in a substandard inn or refusing to deal with those below her in birth, are all examples of her noble snobbery. She ended up as the party’s primary spellcaster.\n\n•\t**Turlog** – the half-orc sorcerer with incredibly low charisma (his pet geriatric wolf had more charisma than him). Turlog had been raised by wolves, explaining his low charisma and tendency to sniff party members’ butts. According to the rules, a sorcerer with a charisma score as low as Turlog’s should not be able to cast spells, but I loved the character so much I decided to allow him to cast spells anyway…with his fists. Basically, Turlog would announce that he would punch his target and explain what kind of spell he wanted and what level spell he desired. Rolling high, Turlog would cast an appropriate spell (or even a higher level spell with an excellent roll). Rolling low, Turlog would cast…something else, perhaps even the exact opposite of what he wanted. Turlog was also well versed in Perform (Poetry), and his awful verses punctuated certain moments of the game.\n\n•\t**Susan** – the human barbarian. Susan’s parents had wanted a girl, but upon giving birth to a boy, they named him Susan anyway. Susan’s main goal was to prove his manliness. Throughout the game, he had mixed success. Susan had also put a few ranks in “Make it Sticky”. None of us are quite sure what purpose it serves, but we all assume that, at the right moment, it will reveal itself to be a highly useful skill.\n\n•\t**Eldamar Elrohir** – the elven cleric of St Cuthbert, dedicated to eradicating the undead; so obsessed was he by his task that he would begin any conversation with, “You don’t happen to have any undead problems, do you?” Nobody could pronounce his name, so the rest of the party began to refer to him as “El Dummo”, which infuriated Eldamar to no end. Nevertheless, Eldamar and his healing was the only thing keeping Turlog alive.\n\n•\t**Steven** (**Stevie**) – the goliath paladin, dedicated to the Great Goat in the Sky. Thanks to his awful dexterity, Stevie’s highest possible initiative score at the beginning of the game was 3 and his flat-footed AC (his AC when caught unprepared) was actually higher than his regular AC (I’m pretty sure the rulebook has a thing for this…but what the hell). When thinking, Stevie would begin his thoughts with, “Stevie wonder…”\n\n•\t **Rose “Swiftarrow” Hearthshire** – the halfling ranger. She is a quiet, shy character in social situations, but in combat her skill with the bow and arrow are unmatched (at least, not by any PCs), and this has allowed her to keep the party alive.\n\n•\t **Yrioth** – the gnome rogue. Drowning in skill points, Yrioth is a font of skill, from stealth to stealing, from acrobatics to alchemy. Unfortunately, his lack of ranks in Spot or Search have often caused him to fall prey to nearly every trap the party comes across. His chaotic antics often lead to his injury and it takes a great deal of persuasion on the part of the good characters to get somebody to heal him. \n\nThe characters all met on a carriage on the way to the village of Thorpe, to attend the wedding of their mutual friend, Seamus. Before the adventure had even begun, they all knew it would be an adventure worthy of poetry (Turlog’s poetry, of course).\n\n[Part 1 - Susan has to Make it Sticky alone](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2omm9z/dd_35_debauchery_tea_party_part_1_susan_has_to/)",

        "text": "The system is 3.5. Setting is homebrewed. Party was level 5, I think. We were young and naive... :)\n\nThis is a story from my first and currently only campaign I played (it's still ongoing). The players are... very varied, personality-wise. This happened mid-quest, because one of the players (referred to as Nameless) got bored of his Ranger and wanted something new. A caster, to be specific.\n\nCharacters:  \n**Ansung** (me), a rather paranoid CN Warlock with an unhealthy interest in everything Lower-Planes (In all fairness, that interest has yet to be brought up, because we haven't met anything from there)  \n**Megara**, a professional bounty-hunting Fire Elf Ranger, perhaps a bit greedy, certainly not lawful... Her bounty-hunting career started around the time she and her twin brother burned down the orphanage where they lived.  \n**Ghaz**, a half-Orc Barbarian. He likes cats and fighting. That'd be about it.  \n**DMPC_Fiora**. Well, not a typical DMPC. We ended up saving her from some bandits and *some* of us refused to give her some gold and put her in an orphanage.  \nAnd finally, **Nameless**. He appeared to be human. He rode a hippogriff, wore mithral armor and used immaterial weapons... After the events of the story, I learned he was a Psychic Warrior / Soul Knife dual class.\n\nBefore further ado... \n\n------------------\n\nAs Those Things usually go, we were in a tavern. Not just any tavern, but Grey's. Grey's is, for the lack of info, a chain of taverns where your average adventuring Joe can buy a drink, warm himself next to a fire and cash in a bounty for the 20 Ogre heads he's been towing for the past fortnight. \n\nAt the moment, the party consisted of Ansung and Megara. While doing some shopping, Megara met Ghaz who was, at the time, weaponless and promised to fight for us if she gave him a greatsword she planned to sell.\n\nNameless was... much harder. Back at Grey's, who gave us some more info about the person we were tracking, we first saw him in pretty much the same pose as Frodo saw Aragorn. Grey told us Nameless saw the person after which we were going, so we talked to him. Well, he did and he joined us... IIRC, he pretty much invited himself. Naturally, Megara and Ansung didn't really trust him much.\n\nFollowing a cold, nearly dead trail led us to two things. The first one was a massive battle between Hobgoblins and Goblins. That was one of the problems in the area. Like all smart people, we swooped in and killed what few survivors remained. Amongst roughly 50 or 70 corpses, there was a pile of dirt, sort of like a pedestal. Nameless swooped in and took whatever was on it (artifact-level Mcguffin, but not for that quest) while the others were looking around. Strike one - what little trust we had, suddenly disappeared.\n\nThe second thing was a tavern. A nice, comfy tavern that appeared to be doing well, despite being in the middle of nowhere, near the border with a hostile country, on a dead road. Tavernkeeper, Mezarr, seemed like a fairly nice half-Elf. And terrified, because Ghaz and Nameless took it for themselves to ransack his cellar in search of things. And things they found... He was a slaver, torturer and possibly a cold-blooded killer. Ansung, who was chatting him up and trying to comfort him, got a bit too relaxed and let him get away. Whoops.\n\nMezarr got away and summoned a dozen or two of fire elementals, which led to a tough fight. We won, noone died and the tavern was razed to the ground... Combination of fire and blowing down a supporting wall had that effect, for some reason. Even though she couldn't find his tracks, Megara thought he was still in the vicinity... And after a night-long stakeout, we caught him.\n\nThat night was fun... For starters, Nameless disagreed with Ansung's and Megara's interrogation methods. Former's included a swarm of spiders biting him (Str damage, which results in paralysis and no HP damage), while latter's involved a blazing-hot branding iron heated on the remains of Mezarr's tavern. Well, it came to pushing, shoving and even an attempted kidnapping by Nameless (he was \"saving\" Mezarr from the rest of party) around dawn of the next day.\n\nDuring those events, Ghaz found a cat, Mezarr's cat to be specific, renamed it and started playing with it. Quite a bit. It was... a bit weird, honestly. The night before he was a bloodied killing machine, and now he was playing with a cat the same way as a 5 years old kid.\n\nWell, while we were fighting and arguing, possibly to Mezarr's and GM's dismay, a guard patrol from a nearby guardhouse checked out that fire. Nameless managed to put our prisoner onto the hippogriff when the guards came. After trading some words and disobeying a direct order to step down from the hippogriff, he decided it was a good idea to escape. So, he charged STRAIGHT at mounted guards wielding lances... The poor thing never properly took off. \n\nAnsung, Megara and Ghaz shrugged their shoulders and just remained there, pretty much motionless. Nameless tried fighting, then running on foot. It didn't go too well.\n\nMezarr ended up dead. Hippogriff was barely alive, but we healed him. He's still with us. And he's MUCH more popular than his old owner. :)\n\nWhat happened later... And before... is completely unimportant for the story. Those guards did end up dead, because they brought in a torturer.\n\n-----------------\n\nThe bottom line is... If you don't make connections to others, they will not feel obligated to get you out of trouble. If you play a loner, you die a loner, simple as that.\n\nFor the curious... Total number of sessions Nameless lived was 3. Introduction-and-(Hob)Goblins, Tavern-fight and Aftermath. He's now playing as an intelligent weapon and I'm pretty sure he spends most of the sessions Redditing. ",

        "text": "The set of this scene of a great mortal act is in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East starting in the year 1257 AD. The Mongols are wreaking havoc across the civilized world, the Crusaders hold Jerusalem, and Italy is fractured into Republics and warring noble families, and of course, the Pope wields absurd power and influence on the Christian world. Our focus is in Northern Italy. \n\nHarald is a major Lord of Genoa, a foreigner by birth and of the North, young, fair haired and bright eyed, earning his reputation as \"The Northman\". He fights to find honor and glory in this Italian Republic he swore his allegiance to... for now. He has a reputation of being exceedingly more belligerent than his noble peer, the Marshall of the republic.\n\nDecember has come, a harbinger of death \n\nDespite previous positive relations, the ambitions of the Holy Roman Emperor surfeited his mortal limits, and he would bring his wroth down on his adopted homeland, a small Republic on the North West cost of Italy. The German peninsular campaign had began years earlier after their annexation of Bohemia, and as their sole enemy Poland under full invasion by the Mongols, the Emperor turned his eye on Genoa, a peaceful land, still recovering from a successful but bloody campaign in what was Carthage. The Hafsid Dynasty was in ruin. Oh, how the mighty have fallen, and how they will fall again. \n\nWhile the other Geonese lords indulged themselves in North African exoticism, Harald stood vigil from Pisa, his prize for his critical role in the war against an aggressive neighboring Republic. His wealth was extensive, accruing money and fame from the tournament rings, widespread business endeavors and trade with the Baltics. When war was declared, the Marshall, a good man, but a timid one, called the banners to the capital. A valiant effort, but with Harald being the only Lord on Italy proper due to the absence of the King at a frivolity of a minor lord in his new African fiefdom, he  would have to act diligently if he was to turn the odds against the Empire. \n\nEven at the Northman's full might he could not withstand 20 lords in all their wroth, and even with Genoa's 7 present lords the situation was still dire. Harald rallied as many men as he could, hiring mercenaries and knights and heavy infantry. 200 men plus the garrison of Pisa, not yet at capacity, around 200 men. 400 against 3600. \n\n9 to 1, a fearful odds. Besides, they were veterans, and fresh. All based outside the walls of Pisa. The gates are strong, and shut. \n\nThey came upon them like a tempest wave, and shook the strong-based promontory of the walls. The Germans sent up three waves to meet their death. The defenses would not yield so easily, and the tide receded as the light of the day drowned in the creeping dark of the night. The Emperor would try again when morning came. Or sooner, or later, either way, the garrison would not rest easy that night. It seemed death was naught but certain, all they could do was wait. But Harald had strategy on his mind, and seized the opportunity of the night to escape the city and slip past the siege lines.\n\nDay broke to the thunder of hooves. In the East, Dawn crowned the glory of Genoa's nobles as they came crashing down upon the Imperial host. The Imperial army was scattered, German lords sent into disarray at the ambush. The 7 Lords of Genoa separated and engaged with their infantry. They had carved their way past the Germans and stood between them and Genoa. Despite the attrition of German lords too cowardly or foolish to rally, the Emperor managed to divide his nobles to engage each of the 7 hosts of Genoa. But it was awkward, uneven, although the Germans were never outnumbered in any engagement. Harald would not trust the valor of his allies to carry the day.\n\nHarald doubled back to his fiefs around Rapallo, a village outside the capital of Genoa. There he rally the entirety of his strength, and the greater portion of the local population. It would cost the wealth of his fiefs and his treasury but it made no matter. 200 men at his back, Sergeants, Knights, Geonese crossbowmen, mercenary companies and common folk. Behind him are two hosts led by captains, bound and loyal to the Northman. 250 Each, he came down upon the chaos around Pisa with 700 men.\n\nLike the hammer of god he came down on the flank of the enemy, sending them to route. But horses are faster than men, and none were spared. The Emperor saw his cause lost and fled to Strasbourg, leaving his subjects to be butchered. One by one, the Geonese lords that had fought valiantly through the night to hold their position found themselves chasing down their foes that had shown them such a fierce display when they thought victory was easy. They ran and died like chattel, and the Lords came under the Northman's custody. \n\nThe imperial army was annihilated entirely. 3600 fell to 1200. 19 German lords in Pisa's prison tower. The other Italian Lords went home to replenish their drained forces. \n\nThe North came to Strasbourg. \n",

        "text": "Over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2o6g73/vampire_the_dark_ages_blood_sweat_and_tears/), I set up our location and we get our base group of PCs (way too many!). \n\n***\n\nThe first game night, we had all the players meet one another, introduce characters to one another, set up the basic hierarchy of the city. That first night we didn't get much else accomplished aside from some general setting of the city - who did what where and Havens and connections and such. \n\nJeton was a pretty bright star. The character was obviously very tied to the city and its people. He quickly became a local legend - a ghost that haunted the local cemetery, pining for his lost love and shortened life. Some quick vignettes as we worked out the group that first night demonstrated this.      \nConversely, Verik was fairly well despised around town. He was big, intimidating, and mean. Overly quiet (still half-playing to that Mute flaw that I nixed), he seemed to resent the people of the town and they him.     \nIn a similar fashion, two of the Tzimisce players decided that they were related - siblings to be precise. One of which was loved or at least respected in town - Alyce - and another who was feared and loathed - Obryn. \n\nThe main plot that got latched onto (unintentionally) that first night was the unknown Vampire in Torpor under the city. It highly worried the PCs. It seems that by 'giving' them the city to control and administer, I had inadvertently made the slumbering ancient an immediate and poignant threat to that stability. They wanted to know who and what it was as well as how to find it, excise it, and possibly destroy it.     \nThat seemed to take a front stage to what I had intended to be the main plot - the arrival of strangers in town seeking to establish ties with the city and distant Constantinople. The strangers were militant, armed, and had started to build a tower-fortress overlooking the one mountain pass that lead east away from the coastal valley the city itself commanded. \n\nThe strangers were in town, buying up supplies, hiring woodsmen and masons, and asking questions about the local Catholic Church. Somehow, the PCs decided that the unnamed vampire *must* be slumbering under said Catholic Church (another NPC slept in the crypts beneath the Orthodox Church after all) and that the pointed questions the strangers were asking was (in some way I never quite understood) a clue because those strangers were obviously being manipulated by the terror under the town, right?!     \nUh. Yeah. Sure. That sounds good. Whatever you say, players.\n\nThe strangers loaded up a wagon and team of horses along with a train of a few mules loaded with supplies and their hired help and headed east. Two of them stayed behind.      \nThe PCs pretty much split up into three groups at this point - one small group was following the strangers back into the mountains to the strangers' tower; a second group was half-watching the strangers left in town; the last group were PCs who didn't seem to care one way or another and were going about their nightly lives and dealing with their own issues. \n\nSecond game night, up in the mountains, one group (Obryn, Daniel, Saban) found the strangers' tower.  They were doing their best to be stealthy, but soon figured out that there was no way they could hang around and investigate if they wanted to get back to their havens (and out of the sunlight) come morning. This was intentional to give a sense of how distant this tower was from the safety of the city. The PCs however took it differently. The sunlight was clearly their enemy and these fiendish strangers were holding the only thing that meant survival - stout stone walls. I tried to point out other options when it became clear that the PCs were intending to stay - digging makeshift 'graves' for themselves, stealing the wagon and sleeping beneath it, going the social route and asking the strangers if they could stay with them. This last was what I preferred, clearly, as I pointed out that a bunch of the townsfolk who had come up here to help were going to be sleeping in tents, but that at least two or three of the strangers were Vampires as well.      \nThat sealed it. No other vampires in their territory.      \nI rolled with that. I worked with it. The strangers were Tremere. They were expanding into the area, they were trying to establish a route to Constantinople because of some mystical significance. They had some Blood Magic that they would use to secure the tower. Clearly, they needed local allies.     \nIt was a bloodbath.      \nThe PCs summoned away some of the workers from the city and started working to convince them that they'd been hired by cruel and sadistic invaders, that they should arm themselves with their tools and be prepared to fight off the men-at-arms that were with the strangers. Then, Obryn walked right up to the tower and the stranger that seemed to be in charge... and in a sudden assault, tore his head off. Before dawn, the three PCs had killed the vampiric strangers, slaughtered a bunch of the (presumably ghouled) men-at-arms, and told the workers that they'd double their pay to finish the tower in the next week. Obryn promptly claimed the tower as his and had mortal workers take the wagon back to the city to start moving his goods out here to the city. Some of the workers who'd shown the best skill were made into a temporary household guard, and the PCs went to sleep in the basement of the tower to await the next night. \n*Note: this would be the last time for several sessions that Saban's player would be present. The first game session he missed, we didn't know why, so I said that Saban was just out watching the tower. Then he became a wandering woodsman/sheriff around the Tower. Eventually, we found out that his player was in prison! (Long story there.) We started mailing letters back and forth - we'd tell him what was going on in game, he'd write back with a bunch of character goals and actions. Which was how he eventually became retconned into a werewolf instead of a Caitiff.*\n\nBack in the city, during all of this craziness at the tower (I actually switched back and forth between the action during the game), the PCs watching the strangers in town figured out that at least one of them was a vampire and they sort of figured out that they were Tremere. At the very least, they got the idea that the strangers needed allies and were trying to establish some sort of Haven in the area. Their questions about the Church were due to prior prosecution by Hunters supported by the Church (one of the strangers had a flaw related to the Church).    \nThe PCs in town decided to leave them alone, keeping hidden, but not stopping them. (Pretty good since they knew what was going on up at the Tower where the assault was in the planning stages by this time.)      \nAnd then, disaster struck. The PCs had stopped their surveillance of the strangers in town so that they could deal with other mundane things. Then the Church in town caught fire. The Catholic priests were running around, wailing. The townsfolk were scared and nervous. There was a lot of panic.     \nAnd then, Jeton - beloved ghost in town - used his power over emotions to try to calm the townsfolk, to organize them into some sort of defense to save the Church (or at least the area around it). Jacob, who had some sway at the port, got the sailors involved in wetting huge canvas sheets and carrying buckets of water up into the town to save as much as possible. It was kind of cool to see the Vampires working to inspire people, command them, and use them to save things instead of just destroying it.      \nAnd then, Verik got bored. He'd been watching from the shadows and after using some blood to help some of the sailors carry things, he claimed to be hungry. He didn't want to get too near the flames, nor did he particularly care about saving the local Catholic Church. So, instead, the player said that Verik wanted to grab one of the nearby priests and drag him off into the shadows to drink from him.    \nIn front of everyone there who were all looking to the priests and to Jeton to try and save the church. In front of the locals and the local vampires (admittedly, of the local vampires, most of them weren't really working to save the Church, but really only interested in saving Havens near to the Church). Verik rolls but botches his attempt at stealth so it becomes a public spectacle of him dragging one of the local priests away.    \nJeton, who doesn't understand vampires remember, is having none of it. He has a big fancy silver cross (that can do double duty at a knife and a club) and he brandishes it aloft while flinging himself towards this manifest demon that dares attack one of God's workers.    \nThere's a brief bit of silence. Player vs Player combat is about to start. This could shake the foundations of the city and the players seem to feel it. I ask both parties for some clarification. Verik is determined to protect his meal, like a dog growling over a favored bone. Jeton, however, doesn't care about Verik. He wants to save the priest, doesn't care if he himself gets hurt in the process, doesn't intend to hurt Verik but only get him to drop the priest.     \nSo, Jeton charges towards the shadows. There are a number of other PCs in the area and none of them interfere, they only watch. Jeton comes within striking distance of Verik, Verik gets initiative. Verik drops the priest (injured and terrified) and pops claws intending to attack Jeton. Jeton changes his action into catching the priest before he hits the ground. Next round, Jeton turns to flee back towards the burning Church and the townsfolk; Verik slashes at Jeton's back, flaying it open with some aggravated damage. Third round, Jeton flees. Verik starts to pursue, but is stopped by Alyce. She coldly informs Verik that while he is indeed free to feed upon any unclaimed Kine that he is not to assault any of the city's Kindred population.    \nVerik decides to flee. \n\nWhile Jeton is being hailed as a saving angel, a vision appears over the nave of the Church. The fire under control nevertheless is still sending up clouds of black smoke. Amidst this, atop the nave, a figure like an angel but completely comprised of shadow and smoke and darkness appears. It is silent but seems to bestow some blessing on the assembled townsfolk below before it vanishes once again.     \nThe PCs take this mysterious sign to be from the unnamed slumbering elder. They also thought the fire was set by the mysterious slumbering elder, however, so their theories carry not much weight. \n\nVerik, before fleeing, decides to blow off some steak against Alyce and her noble house. He heads off to brood for the rest of the night, deciding to get his revenge for her slight against him the next night.     \nThe next night, however, Obryn has returned from the Tower, flush with success. He hears about Verik's assault on Jeton and while Obryn doesn't really care about Jeton and think's he's a bit of a prat doesn't like the assault Verik made. \"Punches and kicks and blows are one thing, but tearing the skin of the undead is outlawed.\" Obryn and Alyce and Livinia decide that as the ruling triumvirate, they have to make an example of Verik.      \n\nThey run into Verik just as Verik is approaching the manor where Alyce resides. Obryn wastes no time in ordering his household guard to seize Verik. Verik kills a few of the mortals in rapid succession, but takes a few wounds in the process. So he flees.    \nAboard the wagon (the same wagon that journeyed to the tower and back), Obryn and his men give chase. When Verik leaves the city, they pursue. Eventually, they stop off the road in a clearing outside of town, Verik turning to make his stand. Obryn orders him to come, subject himself to their judgement and be done with this shameful behavior. Verik is having none of it. The men-at-arms, armed now with long wooden pikes (giant stakes, baby!), advance. There's some initiative rolls. Verik decides to go to ground, melding with the earth in order to hide and escape. The men-at-arms attack. One of them and Verik have the same initiative. I roll for the man-at-arms and his attempt to stake Verik remarkably succeeds (it's actually hard to stake a vampire in the game and for this mortal to pull it off was kind of astounding). Since they had the same initiative total, Verik gets staked *as* he's melding with the earth. So, he's staked, but under the ground and can't be attacked further.    \nObryn is furious. He orders the men-at-arms to stand watch, sends others back to town for shovels, and has the entire area dug up as one huge piece, a tarp put under it, and the whole thing put upon the wagon and carried off to the Tower (not the city, you'll note).      \n\nThe night's game ended there, but we worked out what was going on. \n\nSince he was staked, Verik couldn't voluntarily leave the ground. Obryn had a powerful Tzimisce Koldun (blood magic of a sort) come and magic Verik out of the ground, still staked. Then Obryn stripped all of Verik's flesh away and crafted his skeleton into a huge bone sword. Technically, the sword was still Verik and was still \"alive\", but obviously Verik wasn't a viable character anymore.    \nAs far as anyone in town knew, however, Verik had fled the city and never returned. Only Obryn, Alyce, Livinia, and Verik knew his fate. Saban would learn about it eventually. *(And of course pretty much all the Player's knew.)*     \nI failed to see the wisdom in keeping Verik's fate secret. I thought that it would be a good deterrent to other Kindred in the city who might question the Triumvirate's rule, but... the Player's were calling the shots.   \n\nVerik's player would create a Malkavian wandering monk next. I don't remember the character's name; he was called the Mad Monk (obviously) and I think he only lasted two game sessions. ",
