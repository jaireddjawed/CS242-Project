After the weeks following his death I got a text message from a number that I didn't realize saying sorry we haven't talked in a while. I showed it to my aunt, and she said that I may want to delete it, and I did because I wasn't sure if it was a scam. \nNow I'm kinda questioning it because I was looking up how to tell if your loved ones are near you, and someone saod that if you receive a message via text, email etc then it's a possibility that they're around, and then that memory came to mind. I think that this is pretty interesting. I'm not saying that it's a fact because I'm not certain. I really like the idea of it being a maybe because even though he was an absent parent he was still my dad. \n\nMore about him is on my page if you're interested. Thanks, and have a great day/night wherever you are 🫠😊👻",

I know these things are common with people, I’ve done a lot of digging. \n\nBut lately it’s been getting worse. My house is not haunted, I believe in the paranormal but I am determined to figure out some sort of explanation for this. I feel my mattress underneath me rolling underneath my body and I also feel my mattress like breathing. I hold my breath and everything to see if it’s just me. It’s not lol. It just feels like someone is inside my mattress doing weird hand motions under my body. It only happens at night, and I sleep alone. Sometimes I will lay down facing the wall and it feels like something pressing down looking at me on my other side. And when I’m facing the opposite direction, away from the wall, I feel like a whole ass person laying next to me and sometimes I even think it’s pulling the blanket towards it or something. I look and nothing is there. \n\nAnother thing that freaked me out a bit is that when I tried to look up on google to see if anyone else experiences it, and of course I saw that other people did, so I clicked on the links and such to read their stories but the pages were not loading and my phone was frozen and I couldn’t look anything up. So I gave up on that and just tried to fall asleep but it was still happening. Idk what to do, it’s starting to make it harder for me to fall asleep because it freaks me out a bit. \n\nAnyone have any ideas? Again, I don’t experience anything weird around my house. I am even considering that maybe I have restless leg syndrome, idk. It’s definitely not sleep paralysis, I’ve experienced that before so I know what it’s like. It’s just when I’m laying down wide awake. Let me know if it’s physics being weird or if there’s some sort of banishing ritual I need to do lmao.",

        "text": "Hi all. Thought I'd share something interesting that happened to me about 15 years ago.\n\nMost won't believe me but for what it's worth I promise everything I tell you is 100% true and how it happened to the best of my memory however names have been changed\n\nI was about 18 and I was hanging out at my friend Joanne's house with some other school friends.\n\nCan't quite remember how we got onto the subject but towards the end of the evening Joanne thought it would be fun to perform a seance! Joanne's and her family were from Capetown South Africa had a deep rooted interest in the spiritual (or at least that's what Joanne made out to us)\n\nWith the lights off and candles lit We all sat at a round table, with cards fanned out around the edge. Each card had a letter of the alphabet arranged A-Z and a shot glass placed in the middle. Joanne starts speaking out to the spirits in Afrikaans. I remember pulling a face and rolling my eyes (it was too dark for anyone to take offence) at the time I was an insufferable 'enlightened' atheist teen dork! You know the type, cringey 4chan edgelord who thinks any form of spirituality or religion is beneath me and my superior intellect! I never wore a fedora but I was damn close! However what was about to happen made me question everything\n\nIt started mundane enough, a few questions were asked and the shot glass we were resting our fingers on started to move to and fro until eventually one of my friends asked 'the spirit' if they were associated with anyone in the room. The shot glass moved directly towards me. Incredulous I asked 'the spirit'  \"if you're associated with me then what's my mother's maiden name?\" My eyes fixate on the letters that spell out her maiden name (Jones) but the glass started spelling out something different. First the glass went to \"T\" then \"H\" then \"O\" I thought then it was bullshit as it was completely wrong then I was struck by a horrific realisation!\n\nWhen my mom was 6 months old her biological father died of a heart attack and a year after that she took her step father's name! I completely forgot this in the moment as I was expecting the glass to read out the maiden name she had for the majority of her life but it was actually spelling out her original maiden name of Thompson! \n\nIt was a fact so trivial that I barely remembered it myself! It was something never talked about even within my family as it happened so long ago! It would be hard to believe that any of my friends would know this esoteric piece of my family's history that occurred 20 years before I was even born but non the less some how it was being spelled out Infront of my very eyes! THOMPSON! My school friends and I wouldn't talk about anything deeper than video games and tits at that age yet there's no way I ever mentioned this to any of them! \n It's not like one of my pot smoking looser friends had a copy of my mom's birth certificate and none of them had ever met anyone else in my family. There was literally no way anyone could have known this!\n\nBefore I could contemplate this for too long or ask any other questions to my ghostly associate Joanne's mom came into the room and turns the lights on and with a thick SA accent shouts something like \"bloody hell Joanne, stop messing around with this silly crap\" And put a definitive stop to the proceedings\n\nOf course at the time I played off as a prank but the more I think of it, the more my mind wonders. Did something actually paranormal happen that night? I know it's nothing dramatic or exciting, I didn't see an apparition or a cryptid, but unlike 90% of the shit you read on reddit this experience is actually true and something to this day I can't explain. I'd love to hear your thoughts\n\nTLDR: Very obscure information about my family history was divulged during a seance which non of the participants could have possibly known!",

We have 3 cats, but it is definitely a sound of human knocking, and at a human level. Like, if you hear it  you think someone in your family needs to use the bathroom. I always ask my boyfriend if he needs to use it after I hear the knocking, but he responds from the couch... And he couldn't possibly knock on the bathroom door and run back to the couch without me hearing it, because I ask immediatelly after the knocking. \nThe knocking happens at around 6 pm one day, and the next at around 7 pm. \nThe days when it is at 6pm, it sounds like \"knock-knock... knock-knocks\" (2 pairs of knocks separated by about 2 seconds of silence after the first pair). But the days when the knocking happems at 7pm, the 4 knocks are all together.\nAt first I thought I was going crazy, but this evening my boyfriend came from his home office, and asked me if I knocked but I was on the couch crocheting with a cat on my lap so...\nI don't know if this is related or not, but for the past 10 days - or nights should I say - I just can't sleep. I keep laying in bed and mostly look at the doorway leading to the hallway that separates all the rooms in our apartment, until at least 1am.\nMy cats have also been acting weird, they usually snuggle with us in bed at night, but our youngest cat now just sits in the doorway and sometimes looks up at the bathroom door just like she does at us when we call her name.....\nCan someone explain what is going on please?",

So as I was lying there staring at the wall I kind of felt the bed shaking a little as if it was a tiny little earthquake and I tried to ignore it because I didn't think it was that big of a deal but then the shaking intensified and the bed was shaking vigorously in a way that jolted me and I was holding on to the rails attached to the bed. I tried waking my mom up but she was sound asleep and then the shaking stopped and I fell asleep\n\nThe next day I googled if there was any seismic activity happening in my area but there was none, I even asked my mom if she felt something, but she was as clueless as ever. I don't know what exactly happened and I don't even know what could've happened so I'm just curious",

I’m sorry if my post is riddled with any spelling issues or grammar issues I am dyslexic.\n\nI have had many paranormal experiences in my life from as common is seeing shadows dart around, to seeing something hanging over my boyfriend in his sleep. It is to the point where it is a common joke with my friends and family how often I see spirits. \n\nwhen I was a kid I used to be a little bit more skeptical and I would mess around with Ouija boards all the time and play any kind of paranormal game that was out there. Before then I never really saw or experienced anything paranormal.  after playing all those games when I was younger however, now I see spirits all the time. this is just to give a little background this is not really the issue that I need help with I have seen ghosts and spirits many times and never really been scared. However over the past year I’ve seen a new spirit that I have never seen before and it terrifies me. \n\nOne night I was up late playing the Sims on my computer (as one does) and something catches my eye through my peripherals. when I look at it I saw this lady hanging from the ceiling on all fours. The best way to explain her appearance is something similar to the girl from the grudge but all black. now this isn’t one of those situations where it was super dark in my room and my eyes just saw and made up something in the shadows. my room has a bathroom in it and I had that bathroom light on and the door open. I saw her in between the opening of that bathroom door and my room, she was crawling in my room, very slowly but i saw her moving in a crawling motion. \n\nafter she had caught my eye I stared at her for a couple seconds and then looked back at my game pretending I didn’t see anything this is usually what I do if I have seen some kind of spirit in my room. A couple seconds after me staring at my game I hear some thing whisper “hey” in my ear. I’ve never heard voices in my life. after being scared shitless i run downstairs and decide to sleep in my baby brothers room. The rest of the night I heard footsteps pounding on top of me from upstairs. \n\ni’ve only seen her maybe four times since then and it is nothing like the first time she does not speak to me. but it still terrifies me and I cannot sleep without lights on in my room and the bathroom door closed. I have tried sage. I have tried everything.  Does someone have any recommendations for what this creature may be and why she’s following me.",

I was originally planning on staying 4 nights but this incident cut my visit short. \n\nI got startled out of my sleep by the sound of very loud and fast banging on my door, over and over. It sounded like someone was rapping on my door with their fists, kind of like a drumroll sound. It only stopped when I turned on my lamp beside my bed. It was so loud I literally thought it was morning and my mom was trying to wake me up but it was almost 5 AM when this happened and she was dead asleep. I knew better than to open it or anything, but it freaked me out so bad I didn’t sleep for two or three hours after that. \n\nTo make things even more interesting, my sister (who has always had a sensitivity to the paranormal) has also been staying at home for a little while and has been hearing her name whispered in her ear. So much so, the first couple nights she stayed here she went into my parents bedroom because she was so freaked out and thought they were calling her. Her room also just so happens to be across the hall from mine. \n\nI’m sharing this story to better understand what is going on in my house and if I should be concerned. I have a cross on my door, I’m wondering if that’s why whatever that was was so violent with the knocking? Whatever it may be, I’m glad to be back in my dorm and away from that!",

I’ve been living here for over 18 years and I know I’m not mentally sick or having auditory hallucinations or having visual problems since I have been medically checked by multiple doctors on many occasions by my request. So now I’m more confused than ever.\n\nVery often I wake up in the very early mornings to clearly hearing my living husband’s voice calling me by his loving nicknames he’s called me for years and that no living person has ever known about. It wakes me up right away because I’m not a heavy sleeper, so I answer to his voice immediately while opening my eyes, yet he’s never in the room because he’s already woken up and gone to work.\n\nThis is been going on for about 2-3 years. I even wake up to our living little girl’s voice too calling me “mommy” (she’s 7 y/o) and same thing, she’s not in the room.\n\nThese are not yelling calls, but a sweet right next to my ear calling sound.\n\nAnother thing that’s been happening is that I also wake up in the middle of the night to a strong sensation that someone is literally in front of my face watching me. These feel unsettling, always around 3am. Then on other occasions I am sleep yet I can clearly see our bedroom in the dark of night and someone, is this case a sick looking young woman in a long night gown waking towards the side of my bed. She doesn’t scare me, she’s very clear and I can see all her physical features.\n\nAn now in the last 2-3 weeks I keep seeing these shadows see through (white in color or dark gray), either standing right there in front of me in the hallways or doorways or walking by me at random times mostly in daytime. These look like a medium size dogs or small size people, and other times an adult size one. They don’t scare me, yet at times they have appeared in front me catching me off guard causing me to stop on my tracks or jump back.\n\nI have also been having very vivid “dreams”, that really I can’t call dreams, because they feel different, like literally meaningful messages from people that are living but located in other states or countries. All people that I know too or sometimes total strangers that I don’t know who could be deceased or living. These “dreams” don’t scare me, they are very good and tranquil experiences.\n\nCan someone offer some feedback as to what all these experiences might be? and is there anything I need to do to help them or myself. I am not ignoring it because whatever this is is clearly trying heard to her my attention.\n\nThank you so much.",

        "text": "  \n\nWhen I was younger, I remember having some weird experiences that I can’t explain to this day. For context, when I was younger, my Mom had to go into work around 6:00am so she would wake me up around 5:00am to put me in the car, and drop me off at my Aunts. Since my Aunt was retired, she could take care of me and drop me off at Elementary school in the mornings. Every morning was the same, Mom would carry me out of the car, into my Aunts house, and she would either place me in the bed that was in the main bedroom, or when I got a little older I would get out of the car and go there myself. Elementary school didn’t start until 9:00am so I would sleep for a little while, have breakfast, then get ready for school. My cousin would also stay there in the mornings and my Aunt did the same for her. One morning in particular, I was very exhausted, I managed to climb into the bed, falling face first into the pillowcase with my rear end sticking up into the air. A weird position I know, but after a few minutes had passed, it felt like someone pushed me from behind with enough force to knock me flat on my stomach. I wasn’t fully asleep yet so as soon as I felt the push I looked over to the door, assuming my cousin was messing with me which she often does. But no one was there, I didn’t hear any footsteps running into the hall, and the living room light was spilling into the hallway so if she had made it past the doorway by the time I looked I would have at least seen a shadow, but nothing. Another event happened when I was very young and in the same house, but in a different room. I was laying in a bed, my Aunt with me, and right before I fell asleep I felt my body lift up off of the bed very slowly, I think I hovered for a little bit before I felt the sensation of falling and then crashing down on the bed. When I woke up the bed was still moving from the fall, and I remember asking my Aunt if she felt that, whatever she said I can’t remember exactly. I think she was just more concerned about getting more sleep. I should also add that I have had a lot of nightmares taking place in that house, the most reoccurring taking place in the bathroom. It’s always dark, the door never locks and constantly opens itself even after I keep shutting it. And I can feel an overwhelming and evil presence in the bathroom with me, or outside of the door. Another note I should add was that one time I noticed height measuring marks on a certain doorframe. I inquired about it to my Aunt because the names I didn’t recognize. She said the house was previously owned by a man, and when I asked where he was she said he had passed. I remember asking her if he passed in the house and she was tight-lipped about it. I am sure she was that way because she didn’t want to freak me out, and I am sure if I asked today she would tell me everything.",

I knocked on the door, and the sound stopped. After 5 minutes, she came out smiling. I asked her what she was doing inside, and she completely denied it. I told mom about all this, but she did not believe me. She laughed at me. I don't know what's happening. I  am thinking of recording her if this happens today.",

        "text": "Hi all, I'm not a definite believer and I never thought I'd post anything on here, but I need some help!\n\nTLDR : good presence waking up, bad presence falling asleep, bite mark on her body, feeling scared -&gt; I wanna investigate but don't know where to start\n\nMy friend lives in an apartment (we're in France, if that matters). It's a studio, meaning her entrance and kitchen as well as the bedroom are in one unique room. The bedroom is separated from the kitchen by a mere curtain. She has had sleeping issues for a few years. Insomnia, and occasionally sleep paralysis when she saw people maintaining her down. Nothing new here, the usual trivial stuff.\n\nHowever, lately, she's been feeling different. Different things happen when she's trying to sleep. When she wakes up, she frequently has sleep paralysis, but instead of a scary figure, she sees/senses a blonde woman, with a woolen blue sweater, who enters her apartment, passes the curtain (that she sees moving) and comes to gently stroke her cheek to wake her up. This is a calming, protective presence.\n\nOn the other hand, pretty much every night for the last few weeks, when she tries to *fall* asleep, without *being* asleep or having any kind of sleep problem (being lucid), she feels a bad presence. She usually turns around in her bed to face the wall instead of the curtain and the rest of the apartment, but then she feels like she's being watched behind her back. So she turns around to see, and she says she doesn't see him the way she sees people in her everyday life, but she has this image of him in her mind and when she turns around to look it feels like \"when you see a spider in your room right before turning off the light and then you *know* the spider is still there and you look for it, but can't see because it's too dark\". So she doesn't actually SEE someone but she strongly feels there IS someone and she has a mental image of him.\n\nHe's a small man, or maybe child, with curly dark hair, a yellowish, used white t shirt, and gray sweat pants. Who stands right behind her, leaned above her, his hair falling down over her, and just stands there looking at her falling asleep. Night after night he stands closer and closer to the end of the bed, recently he's standing around her bottom/legs area. She says his presence scares her. He used to stand closer to her head, not like she's in immediate danger, but she's still scared of him, and it's starting to really bother her. She thinks this isn't regular sleep problems, but maybe paranormal stuff is going on. \n\nSo I thought it's probably another, new sleeping problem. And I'm still not saying it's absolutely NOT that, BUT... Today she woke up with a bite mark on her thigh. I haven't seen it yet (will maybe update), but she says it's blue (as in a bad bruise) and there's like 5 or 6 defined marks seemingly in the shape of teeth, or maybe fingers that would have gripped real hard. And right around the area the dude is currently standing.\n\nI wanna know more about the history of her place, to know if there could be any connection to anything paranormal. Since I'm no sleep doctor. The dude's clothes sound modern, so ig modern history. That's where I'm stuck. I've made a quick search on the internet, but the amount of info you can get about a random building online seems limited. Do you guys have any tips for doing such research? Where should I start? What should I look for? What data bases, on or off line? Archives of any kind maybe?? Again, we're in France. So if there's something like public archives in your country, I'd still like to know, so that I can at least look if there's anything similar in mine.\n\nThank you to all those who will try to help, I'd really appreciate it as I've never done this before. If there is any additional info to give I'll edit or leave a comment.",

        "text": "So last night, I woke up at around 3 am with an eerie, uncomfortable feeling in my gut that I could not explain. Something told me to turn on my bedroom light, so I did. As soon as the light flicked on, I saw what looked like tiny worms floating around. Everywhere I looked, I saw the worms. But when I closed my eyes, they were gone. I began quickly turning on as many lights as I could, and as soon as they were on, I saw them. They followed me out into the hallway, and into the bathroom where I locked myself for a good 30 minutes trying to figure out what was going on. No one was answering my calls, which is to be expected at 3 am. But I desperately needed help. I started to realize that no one would believe me anyway. I hyperventilated on the bathroom floor and opened the door again, and I saw this massive translucent worm that would not escape from my sight. I wanted to rip my eyes out just so I wouldn’t have to see them. It was like an invasion. And I still do not know if they are supernatural beings, my old gangstalkers playing a trick on me, or alien life of some sort. I will not give my exact location, but I will mention that I live somewhere that is full of mountains and wildlife and many cryptic things do happen. I batted at the air, but they would not move. I was so panicked that I eventually simply blacked out and do not remember much of what happened, but I will say that I woke up from a fetal position in the living room floor. I do not see the worm-like beings anymore, but I have been on-edge all damn day because of this. Someone please tell me I am not alone in this.",

        "text": "So, this event happened a few years back, I was probably ten at the time. I remember a part of that day where my family and I were delivering groceries from our car to the kitchen. It was sometime in the afternoon, because the sun was still bright. For context, if you go through the front door, straight ahead of you would be the hallway that turned left, and there were three rooms lining it. Two bedrooms and one bathroom. On the right side of the living room was a giant space that led to the kitchen. In the middle of the living room is a table. \n\nI clearly remember that I was carrying a few bags, and when I was about to pass the table, in the corner of my left eye, in the hallway, there was this strange figure. It was tall, probably about seven feet tall. It was pale white, like albino. It didn’t have any face either, no features at all. No nose, eyes, ears, bellybutton, or reproductive organs. \n\nI saw it for a split second before it was just gone. But during that time, I felt that it was staring at me. When I looked at it during that split second, I felt actual, genuine fear. It ended as soon as I noticed it, but I never said anything about it. However; I’ve seen it about a hundred times since then. It is always in that hallway, I’ve never seen it anywhere else. Sometimes it’s just standing, sometimes crouching, or just peaking around a corner. \n\nI’ve told my father about it before, and he just tells me of his sleep paralysis experience. A strange thing I picked up on in his story is that his “shadow person” was very tall, which I thought was interesting. I haven’t seen it in about two years or so, and I still have a room connected to the hallway. \n\nI don’t believe that our house is on any important land, and as far as I know, nobody has died in the house. If you guys have any experiences like that, maybe you could share them?",

Many unexplainable phenomana such as: footsteps from something other than the living, phantom smells, objects being thrown, items disappearing completely (and never found even after gutting the place before moving). I've always been sensitive to the paranormal since I was a little girl. I even truly believe I've had evil entities enter my dreams. I had a truly evil and gory one when I was only 7 years old, before I was even allowed to be influenced with such things like violent movies and tv. Well a couple years ago I moved to an apartment that is located in the basement of the building (if you follow paranormal stuff you'll know basements are notorious for activity). Since I moved here, I've had poltergeist activity I have seen with my own eyes, I've been woken up to an unknown female voice saying \"hey\" directly in my ear, even causing a breeze on my face from the breath behind the voice. I've also seen orbs with both my own eyes and with my phone camera (that my cat has seen at the same time as well). My bedroom door has been knocked on more than one occassion and woken me up from sleep. I had another dream recently after moving here that I believe was paranormal. I was not myself in the dream, I was not even the same ethnicity or age of a person in my dream and it was beyond vivid that I saw this person's death at the end of a handgun (I'm in a very bad neighborhood so that kind of death is not uncommon here). Only a week ago I was physically (what felt like) burned, and it left a mark that stayed for hours. Last year I almost drowned and since then my sensitivity to the paranormal I have noticed is stronger than ever, almost I feel, bordering on me being a medium. \n\nThe point of this post is I'm really kinda at the end of my rope. I can't sleep at night because of being afraid of these spirits waking me up or entering my dreams and giving me nightmares. I'm new to reddit sort of, maybe someone can direct me to a sub for people that are paranormally sensitive/mediums that I can connect to people who are the same? \n\nALSO any advice on how I can spiritually protect myself from the evil here?!",

Others had seen her too, I didn't even have to mention anything to them, they'd tell me that they saw her. \n\nI had also talked to my exes first wife before and she told me that when she lived here, the most paranormal thing that happened to her was seeing \" the cavalry\" coming towards her. Which caused her to freak and her friend that was with her at the time didn't know what happened.\n\nThere are strong Native American ties to this area.",

        "text": "I've debated posting this because of how unreal it sounds. Even in my mind when I remember this instance I doubt myself. However strange and fantastical this story will seem I assure you it is true. \n\nSummer 2006:\nI got a summer job at a hotel working split shifts. Soon after I got my sister in, and she took the night shift. It was nice working with her for half the day, but this left me by myself at the house at night.\n\nOne particular sweltering night in June:\nI stayed up pretty late playing Sims. It must have been close to 2AM, and I decided I better get some sleep. It didn't take long and I was out like a light. \n\nI always sleep with the TV on this night was no different. It was a hot night. I had 2 fans on me, and it was still hot. It must have been 85°F. \n\nAfter I fell asleep I woke up because I felt extremely cold. My arms and legs were freezing! I opened my eyes, but I couldn't see anything. I waited for my eyes to adjust and they never did. I just stared straight up, and I saw what looked like smoke swirling. Inside the smoke was an inky blackness. \n\nNot only could I not see anything but the swirling smoke, but I also noticed I couldn't hear anything.  Remembering I had the TV on I turn my head and see it's on still! A sinking feeling stuck me. Something was wrong. \n\nMy feet were on the floor. My legs were spread apart, and my arms were crossed above my head. I turned my head back, and there it was again. The black and smoke. Almost on top of me! It had a human shape, but absolutely no features.  Just smoke. \n\nI can't explain to you the amount of fear that pumped though me. I still don't know how I did it, but I pulled my legs up back onto the bed and scooted all the way back to the head of the bed. \n\nI curled into myself and I could still see the shape. It almost seemed hooded. The smoke swirled only in the face area. The rest of the form was blacker than black. Darker than any shadow in the room. \n\nIn my new position i could see the light from the TV.  This only made the shape even darker. I broke the silence when I said \"Oh God! Help me!\" \n\nAs soon as I spoke the shadow just... faded, or fazed out. It's hard to explain. Fazed is probably a better word, but was slow and sudden at the same time. Once it was gone. The noise from the TV came back. My sisters dog was on her bed whimpering and crying. \n\nI got up to cuddle him. To make myself and him feel better. He had peed all over the bed. I cleaned him up and the bed. He and I went into the living room and stayed up all night. \n\nI refused to sleep in there for the rest of that summer. I left to go back to college. Shortly after I left that house caught fire when no one was home. The FD said it was an electrical error, but honestly I don't know. I'm just glad I never have to go there again.",

        "text": "I was about 9 yrs old, my dad, me, and my siblings went on a vacation to my grandparents house that’s so far away from home. To visualize the setting, my grandparents’ house was half renovated with the living room and upstairs room. It was a deprecating ancestral house but the kitchen, and bathroom, the upstairs that used to be a boarding house with few rooms, and backyard was still the original house not renovated at that time. Everything was still in construction so the tv was in the kitchen because the living room was a mess. \n\nIt was midnight we were watching a tv show with 2 of my cousins, my sister, and my aunt. We’d laugh so loud at the shows and during advertisements cracking jokes. After a while, suddenly there was a very loud noise from upstairs sounded like kids running around, and we thought it was my aunts children playing, but we didn’t even had the time to react/shout at them because this loud noise came downstairs and I think the best way to describe it, it was like a brown colored wind or ash speeding with stomping sounds down the wooden stairs it passed by the tv and into the sink where the glasses in the rack rattled. We were still frozen in shock and fear and confusion, the wind came back from the sink and past the tv again and up again to the stairs with the stomping feet noise which sounded like it’s in a hurry running up the stairs, the frames hanging on the walls of the stairs shook and one of it even fell. I couldn’t believe at the moment in my life that I just witnessed something that I cannot explain. I’ve told this story to a lot of people some did not believe me and some did. My aunt who always cooked in that kitchen said she was used to that paranormal as well as my cousins and my dad who grew up in that house. They seem to brush it off the day after but my mind as a child at that time was horrified to my core. That experience is something that will haunt me forever, even now in my adulthood.",

        "text": "\nHey everyone, I'm going to try keep this as short and readable as possible, but there are a lot of parts to this story. So apologies if it's super long but might be interesting to you. This is all as true as true can get, I needed to talk about it to people who get it as the people I'm currently living with keep brushing it off. Firstly I want to say that I do believe we create things with our thoughts, and I try my best to control those and keep fear held away from me. Second I want to say that some of the parts of this are stories told from my grandmother and my father, both members of the six nations in northeastern Pennsylvania. They never had a name for this but told me these things without ever speaking to each other about them. They both spoke of it as a cautionary story, not something just to scare me. \n\nI've lived near the Jack's Mountain Ridge part of the Appalachians all my life apart from a few years when I lived in the valley of the Allegheny mountains. Both locations I've experienced things I can't really explain. My grandmother and my father (two separate families and different tribes) also have lived in the central PA area most of their lives as well. The first story was told to me by my dad on our picnic table in our backyard at night where I lived as a five year old. This same house was the childhood home of my grandmother who had given it to my mom (her daughter). My dad warned me to only go outside at night if he walked with me from the house,  or if he was in the shed a few yards away from the house to take long steps but don't run, and go straight inside with him, not to screw around in the dark. That same year I was watching my favorite VHS in my bedroom which at that point was previously a screened porch but now covered by sliding glass doors. Outside those doors we had many stray cats on a little ground level deck, behind this house are woods for miles going up the mountain. That night my curtains were open so I could watch the new kittens that were just born run around and practice hunting bugs under the old light mounted on the outside wall. But the kittens and their parents had gone somewhere else during me watching my tv in between. A few moments after I noticed that they were gone I heard a heavy weight creek all over the deck. Then I covered most of my face with my blanket when I saw a dark colored or soaking wet cougar looking right into the glass doors at me, just watching me for a long time but not making a sound. It eventually left but I had trouble sleeping that night and my parents wouldn't allow me to sleep in bed with them anymore. We had cougars in our area but most of them stayed in the mountain where there was a surplus of deer, and my street had many houses where my extended family lived, and they'd all shoot guns and fireworks so big animals wouldn't frequent thru, usually only a small bear wanting to eat my aunt's pear trees. The really scary part is, I spoke to my grandmother about that experience offhand a few years later. She sighed, stopped for a moment, and told me that the same happened to her as a child living in that house but it was at their front door which was just an old beaten screen door. She also described it as a black panther which I don't think we have up here unless it migrated from the south. This must have been at least 40 years in between. She also revealed to me that her parents told her not to go out at night, no whistling even in the daytime, and don't go close to the farm animals that used to be there (two cows and a horse) at night. She said when she married her husband at 14, Christianity started coming into her life around that time so tradish stories and values eventually were seen as demonic, especially those stories so she put them at the back of her mind. \n\nThe next part comes when I lived in two different places. In our next family home before my dad passed, we lived less than a mile from a woodmill tucked into the same mountain. The woodmill would start it's loud noise at around 6am but some mornings I would wake up before that when I heard flute music coming from the mountain. This sounds corny but it is definitely what I heard. My window was two stories up so I felt safe opening it. The music sounded distant but it was distincly a song. This happened like four times. Sometimes I would also see a strange light in the mountain where there were no houses. I know the buildings of this area well as my family has lived and still lives in buildings all over this mountain. About five years later I lived in the Allegheny mountains outside of Pittsburgh. I lived with my boyfriend there temporarily so every other weekend we would take the long drive back to the Jack's Mountain area to stay with our respective families. On our night drives back to Allegheny, when we would get about ten miles from our house, we drove on a route of curvy back roads. One section of this road went into the woods where there was a small shoulder that people would drop off very old fat back tvs for them to rot without having to pay a dump fee. Almost every time we drove past that part at night, there would be a wonky looking deer standing among the TV's just staring at the car when we drove past. We had laughed about it and named him Tim and just thought he was an outcast deer who made friends with the abandoned TV's. But nowadays I question Tim the deer.\n\nSo currently I'm staying with that same boyfriend and his parents as our apartment had lots of safety issues that were not going to be fixed. His parents live on the opposite side of the mountain I lived as a kid. So this is all the same ridge and forests. First off, his parents have told us strange stories that they brush off as silly that have happened while they lived here alone, with all their kids moved out. One was about an escaped man being tracked by a light from a helicopter the same night someone banged on their door. Keep in mind this is another road owned by one family in a small neighborhood in the mountain's valley. Another time they told us they saw a man standing by their collective mailboxes at the end of the road, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase who then walked up into the woods going up the mountain. My boyfriend told me before that when he and his brother were little they would play in the mountain. They had seen trees that were bent over halfway up, some ripped out by the roots and lying on the ground away from the original place of the tree. They would play games inside a huge and deep bowl shaped crevice in the dirt that seemed like it was dug and dried out years before. My boyfriend said he used to keep his ground level bedroom window open during the summers in middle school usually to sneak out easily or other \"activities\" teen boys hide from their parents, no screen in the window but with the blinds pulled down while he played video games. He'd done it many times before but one night he heard an  incomprehensible deep voice talking in what he described as what english would sound like if you didn't speak english right outside his window and shuffling in the garden beneath. He slammed his window shut, turned the lights off and hid until he fell asleep. \n\nA few months ago when spring was turning into summer, he and I took our old dog out front to go to the bathroom around 9pm. We were right in front of the house which is catty-cornered from his grandparents, all on a stone road surrounded by grass and trees. We suddenly heard what sounded like 50+ people laughing hysterically, but also yelling, male and female, and dogs going nuts in the distance probably a mile away behind us. Us and the dog froze, my dog didn't bark, we just stood terrified. The sounds only lasted about five seconds and they all stopped at once at the very same second. Then three more seconds passed and we still couldn't move until we heard a flemmy snarl coming from a bush about twenty feet in front of us. We we're both in shock that we would hear two terrifying sounds we'd never heard before that seemed far away from each other happen so close together. We pulled the dog inside and ran with our stomachs ready to shoot out our asses. A few weeks later I was out in the daytime and heard what sounded like something doing a bad impression of different cat noises coming from the backyard. I didn't bother investigating and just wanted to forget the sound as it sounded unnatural and not like any bird I'd ever encountered. \n\n\nCut to last night. I work evenings so I stay up late on weeknights, sometimes until two or three am. Last night I went to take my dog out to pee at around 1:45am. Earlier in the night I took him out at dusk and heard two men whistling getting in a truck down the road and my mind went straight to what my grandma had said about whistling. When I took him out later that night in pitch black I stand in the doorway with the leash in hand while he goes off the front porch into the yard. Fall is turning into winter now so I try to stay inside. Its usually fine with just frogs and other night animals making noises. But last night my dog barely walked onto the porch and started barking to the right of the woods in front of the house. Something was coming towards us only about 30 feet away, parting the bushes and I saw a big flash of cream color before I ripped him inside. I feel bad about pulling my dog but I would rather him be pulled by me into safety than whatever tf was coming at him. We've had a small bear come thru here before but he is very shy and runs from our dogs no matter how small they are and is quickly chased off by a flashlight, never has it ever come towards us and it wasn't a cream color, just a simple black bear I wish I had stood a little longer to see the shape of this thing but my adrenaline kicked in and I had to get my dog and me back inside and locked the door quickly. Boyfriends parents woke up because the door caused their dogs to bark, also my dog continued barking when inside which he doesn't do as he's a super meek and quiet 16 year old dog. I was up shaking for like an hour after that and my bfs dad keeps writing it off as the bear but I am insistent there is no way it was a bear. His dad still doesn't believe us about the sounds we heard previously and writes it off as a party going on. But what party have you heard where the people act like dogs, yell and laugh, and suddenly all cut off at the exact same time? Didn't think so. They don't even want to believe in the many ghost experiences weve all had in this house. We do have a ring doorbell camera but we switched wifi providers a few days ago so it's not synced up to a phone right now until my bf gets home later to connect it, but it may still be recording. If I'm able to see last night's footage after we get it reconnected to a phone I will post anything it caught. \n\nI know this is long and all over the place but I was hoping someone could read and maybe help me make sense of all this. I couldn't figure out which subreddit to post in because I can't identify what the hell has been going on, so this seemed like the closest or possibly most helpful sub I could figure. This has all happened over the course of 25 years, not including the stories of people who lived before me. Do you think this is multiple creatures or one thing that can encapsulate all of these events? There are things that seem to mimic other things, and parts that sound like bigfoot encounters, and just strange events by themselves that don't sound like either, especially the man in the suit. Thank you for reading and whatever responses you may have. Its nice to not feel alone with these stories anymore. If you want any other clarification I'd be happy to give it. I posted this on another sub but also posting here bc the other one doesn't have many active members to help me.",

She's been staying with me for a month or so because she has nowhere else to go. One time not too long ago she was talking while I was in the shower so I just thought she was being sneaky on the phone. I called her out she said I was just crazy or schizophrenic like my brother, even tho she claimed to hear the scratching noises on every door she's around too. I set up a camera and recorded her talking to something in the attic with the shower running and the same day downstairs with the water running when said she was doing the dishes. Mysteriously the videos got deleted. She attacks me all the time, I found out 911 was blocked so I couldn't call the cops. I change my password all of the time there's no way she knew my code. The police just tell me it's a civil matter so I got a protective order. I literally just walked in the room an hour ago when she was still here And caught her speaking like a demonic lizard like language in tongues and shit and I was terrified! This is not a joke or a game. Something was talking back to get right in my face and her eyes were rolling back in her head. Then she snapped back into reality or whatever and packed her shit up and started beating on me she also said they will be coming for me when I least expect it. I'm so confused right now. Anybody have related stuff happen to them? It's interesting honestly but I'm so scared lowkey.",

After describing intelligent vs. residual haunts, he asked “why do all the residual haunts wear old Victorian clothing?” Our answer was “Well, we don’t believe all are from that time period. But would you even recognize a more recent residual haunt? The ones dressed in Victorian attire certainly stand out, but would you notice someone wearing jeans, a flannel, &amp; a baseball hat?” \n\nThis kind of blew his mind &amp; he stuck around asking tons of questions afterward, &amp; probably left a little less skeptical, which we love.\n\nDoes anyone have any other examples of moments where you’ve “wowed” people using layman’s terms that us more seasoned paranormal enthusiasts might overlook?\n\nThank you!",

I left my room to go downstairs for a \"nightcap\" of Martini myself, which I drink while writing this, hoping it'll get me back to sleep.\n\nFrom upstairs, I hear a stool at the breakfast bar creak, as it does when someone is sitting on it, since they're old and creaky. I assume my dad got back up and I go downstairs, but, nothing. We do have 2 cats and a dog, but all we're sound asleep in the living room, as was everyone else in the house other than myself. I know this sound by heart. There was no mistaking it.\n\nMy house was built in the 70's. No one has died in it, and as far as I'm aware, the previous owners are still alive too. I was talking to an old woman earlier while I walked in the woods at the back of my property, who casually mentioned, as many older people here do, that they were haunted. She mentioned seeing a family picking blackberries, before vanishing out of thin air. I have seen what I believe to be the exact same thing, in a different part of the woods. All the while, her dog was staring off down the path. She claimed the dog could see a spirit. I actually felt something too, but payed it no mind. The dog took a liking to me, and I to it.\n\nDid something follow us back from the woods? Maybe. Or The chair just creaked on it's own somehow, despite me never noticing such a sound before. That is perhaps more probable. I'm sorry if this was boring, but it's true, at least. My first thought after hearing the sound was something my mother always used to talk about; Stone tape theory.",

        "text": "10 years ago I had the weirdest dream, which led me to a book. \n\nFor some context, I was living with my ex, been together for 5 years, and thing weren’t going very well anymore, since we didn’t really have much in common. I was in the phase where I didn’t know what to do, if to break up or just live like that, which was very sad to me. I was 23 at the time, and I had started again to read philosophy, and learning some physics on my own. Since very young a had this internal “struggle” , not sure what to believe in.\nMy grandma was very religious, I lived with her until 7yo, and kept going to church and Sunday school until 15yo, but on the other hand my father was teaching me science and I became fascinated by both. I always thought there must be some middle point that we are missing, and I’ve been always reading, looking for answers . \n\nThat night, the last thing I did before falling asleep, was listening to music, randomly, and “Send me an angel” by Scorpions was the last song. For some reason, that song made me cry myself out so so desperately, I have  listened to that song hundreds of times and it never had that effect on me. \nBack to the dream, I was in some kind of town , no idea where , walking and observing the buildings and the busy life , the people on the streets. They couldn’t see me, and I was not alone. I will do my best to explain it, as I can’t really describe it with words. There was this “someone” with me, very tall, very thin, grayish, I can’t remember a face, and it wouldn’t speak with words , or in any language, somehow I could just feel it, “understand” it in my head. This being was on my right side whilst showing me this town, and explaining something to me , it was kind of a long dream, and I felt I knew this “person” , it was more like a reunion, like a meet-up. In my dream it was all crystal clear, everything made sense, I knew all the why’s.\nThen this being took me on the top of hill which left the city unfolding in front of us, I have the image in my mind, seeing the town from above, all of it, and now he/she ( it wasn’t a female or male, I can’t remember a name or age) was on my left side, slightly behind, with the left long and thin arm extended , showing me the town from left to right, explaining something, and I acknowledged it, like I knew what I had to do, I was ready. \nI knew then that I was supposed to wake up, and I also knew , and I could still hear this person in my head, that I have this information somehow, somewhere , but I’m not supposed to “remember” it, I was not supposed to have that clarity. It felt like I was studying for an exam, and the book was about to be taken away, leaving me with what I learned . Everything started fading and I was slowly waking up , and this voice turned into a “real” voice, in my language, and I could only hear these words repeating in my head, every time louder and louder, with echo, until I was fully awake. The words were “The spirits book” , over and over again. \n\nI woke up, the words were sounding in my mind, but I dismissed them without a thought, it was nothing familiar to me, and the only thing I could remember from the dream was the long hand extended and the view of the city, but i don’t know why, I didn’t even stop to think about it. \n\nThose words remained in my mind all day long, like a catchy song, until that evening when I suddenly “noticed” and I stopped and “listen”. I then remembered everything ( what I wrote above) but I didn’t know what to do with those words, they weren’t familiar at all. I decided to Google it, and to my surprise, it was a book by Allan Kardec, which I read immediately. A lot of things started to make sense … between that book and all that I learned before, about religions, philosophy, science, it all started to make sense , and I kinda found my middle point. \nShortly, my favourite part is: there’s an axiom that says : there’s no effect without a cause. Look in nature, there are intelligent laws, hence a bigger intelligence must have started it all. That intelligence , call it Ra, God, or the pink unicorn if you like, that is God ( added my personal touch) . And just hay it’s only natural that we can’t understand certain things, as we lack senses for it. \nI only told a couple of people so far, I find it very weird, and even those “friends” kind of dismissed it, I know it’s hard to believe, but I needed to get it out of my chest.\nAnyone else read the book??? Or experienced anything similar??? Cheers!",

        "text": "It started 7 days ago. I (22M) was in my apartment playing video games and our curtain fell. It’s a curtain that uses tension rods and will fall if you step on the curtain and has fallen once or twice in the past 8 months. I’m not sure why I just thought it was the cats and went to bed. The next day they were still on the ground but I had to leave for work. My fiancé (22F) said she came home the next day from staying at her sisters and the curtain was back up. The only reason she noticed this was because she asked if I had fixed them and I told her I thought she had put them back up. I work very long hours and have basically been gone for the past week only coming home to sleep then go to work again. 4 days ago my fiancé was cleaning our room and was dusting our bookshelf. She put a snow globe on our bedside table adjacent to our bookshelf when she got back the snow globe was the only thing on the empty shelf she was dusting. Right after this she continued cleaning and put a bunch of hair ties on the bed to vacuum and when she turned around there were 7-10 hair ties all stacked like a tower. 2 days ago she was cleaning the cat box when she heard what sounded like me from our front door calling her name. I was at work 40 minutes away. She thought I was locked out but had just checked the location of my phone to see I was to far away to make it home in that time. 2 hours after this she heard my voice again from the kitchen calling her name. She went to the kitchen and found all 4 burners on at max heat. Nothing has happened since but we are freaked out. Any advice would be encouraged.",

        "text": "I have been dealing with what people refer to as being managed out from my job. From the things that were happening I will say that maybe it was stressing me out a bit much and I started assuming some \"paranoid things\" which still might have been actually going on. Skipping right to it, I thought my company had been monitoring me on my work computer which is totally possible. From the things that I assumed were happening at work (thought they were going to set me up/frame me or something), I started typing on a blank word document on the computer and not saving it, just typing to anyone that might be watching. This was October 25th so not long ago. I kept saying things like, -break the veil, just tell me what you need in order to make this all stop. If you want me to sign something I will. Lets just figure this out. Please just break the veil. We can talk about this, its okay. Please just talk to me. I'm willing to play ball.\n\nI was super distressed about everything and crying and typing and sitting waiting and watching for a response. I must've repeated break the veil several times. I ended up quitting two days later since I couldn't handle the stress of being managed out. \n\n\\-adding this in here quick. Also within in a couple days of this I was getting myself in the mood for Halloween and was looking up haunted objects for sale on eBay on my phone, most of which were dolls. I clicked on photos of one that had really red eyes and I was gazing into them for quite a while because they just looked bizarre and I was surprised a doll maker would give a doll red eyes so I was also trying to tell if it was like some Etsy persons little art project or something, any ways..\n\nWell a couple days after that I'm in my basement late at night looking through a crate of records singing out loud to a Gram Parsons song I had in my head. Then something pokes me in the back of the arm with a reasonable amount of force. Not like it hurt, but like my arm moved from it. I look over and there's nobody there and I'm home alone. So I walked right upstairs and closed the door and over thought about it for quite a while. \n\nTwo days later my mom comes over to visit and goes in the basement to try and help with laundry (I swear she doesn't still do my laundry! It was a bit surprising) and the dryer is going now so she starts coming up the stairs and I hear her yell \"who is down here???\" and then she pauses, and then comes up. I ask wtf was that? She said she thought she heard someone talking to her and then she assumed she was hearing things. -The dryer ran all night. I had to go down there and turn it off in the morning.\n\nA couple days later I'm missing my notebook that I was documenting work happenings in and I searched everywhere. I seriously moved everything in my office and bedroom which are the only areas it would be in. Didn't turn anything up for hours. So I put it off for a couple days and just assume I set it in a dumb place. Well I found it my closet under a sleeping bag when I was organizing the mess in there. Okay. \n\nHonestly don't remember where this fell in-between the start and last part of this but I was in the kitchen and the basement doorknob turned and the door opened. I heard it, but didn't see it happen. I look around the corner and sure enough it's open two inches. I usually close it, and I began making sure it was always closed after the poking incident. So i walked over and closed it again.\n\nLast Friday I'm in the basement in the middle of the day and I'm already freaked out being in the basement but I need to finish my laundry and shower (only shower is in the basement) so I turn the lights on in that room even though there was plenty of light coming in the tiny glass block windows. I strip down and throw everything in the washer and hop in the shower. When I get out of the shower, the lights are turned off... I dried off super quick got dressed and got upstairs. I'm all goose bumps and freaking out. \n\nI did have a dream on Sunday that I don't want to type out. I'll call it a visitation dream.\n\nI've gone down there twice since which was normal except for me running and having goosebumps because all I could think about was all the things I've mentioned. I was researching online quite a bit today trying to see what I could figure out and thought I would write on here to see what I hear back. Not really sure what to do except keep moving forward but probably very fast ventures in and out of the basement when I need to go down there for laundry and showering... :( Any remedies I could try (given assumptions)?",

Metallic, whirring sound, like it was just hovering. \n\nTo anyone asking if it is maybe some plane, radio, I dont think so. It goes on for like two hours and a plane goes from point a to b. This is constant, one place where it comes from probably.\n\nCheers.",

Some I could confirm with my parents, in the sense that I’d tell them what I remember and they would give me more details and tell me it’s not possible that I remember as I was only months old. \n\nThe one that intrigues the most:\n\nI see it vividly in my mind as if it was minutes ago, I was sitting on the bed at my grandmas, and she was there with my mom. I know I couldn’t walk yet, it was something very natural that I would sit and they would move me around. They were talking loudly and laughing about something ( now I can’t remember the details , but it was something about a woman and whatever happened to her) and I could understand absolutely everything, as the concepts and facts, not only the words , just as an adult, and I started to participate in the conversation in the same loud / excited tone. I remember I went on and on , and I knew very well what I was talking about, I was even explaining something they didn’t seem to understand. \n\nAnd all of a sudden I see my mother confused, looking at me smiling nervously and nodding ( as now as an adult I see parents talking to babies) and telling my grandma, sort of laughing “I have know idea what she’s saying” . My grandma, with the same look, started asking me something in like baby talk, completely unrelated. \n\nI then realised (felt more like I remembered) that in fact they do not understand me, and they were saying words like “mama” and ask me to repeat them. I got very annoyed, as I was absolutely sure I could talk, and I tried again, slowly, but I realised no matter how clear it sounded in my head, out loud it would be just gibberish, and I’d feel my tongue so weird, I just couldn’t control it to make the words sound! \n\nEventually I gave up, but I felt literally stupid, ashamed and humiliated (??). How could I even recognise those emotions?? \n\nSomehow I knew I was a baby , but I can’t understand my lucidity and clarity at that age! It felt like we were all the same, I was “an adult” as well , just my “body” wouldn’t respond to me yet, because it wasn’t ready, that’s what I knew. \n\nAnyone else has experienced anything similar?? Any possible explanation? Thank you.",

        "text": "I am 37 and am writing this because I am at an utter loss and it's becoming concerning......\n\n\nI moved into my apartment a year ago. It's a one big house, but divided into 3 apartments (tri-plex) . I live in one of the upper units.\n\nBefore moving in my downstairs neighbor ( who has known me for 22 years ) said the prior tenant had cats, and they said one of them died up in my apartment. The prior tenant was a hoarder and it was a mess. So much so they never found the body of the cat .........\n\nI never thought anything of it.....\n\nA month or two go by, and I start noticing my cat... She would sit down n just stare off into the corner where my bathroom is, like she sensed something, or someone......\n\nNever really thought anything of it, \" Aphrodite, what are you looking at ?? \" \n\nMore time goes by and out of nowhere, at random times of the day or night, my cat would run around the apartment like she is physically playing with another cat.... Even would get low to the floor, butt in the air type stuff.....\n\nIt started to become an everyday occurrence, so much so it has become an inside joke amongst my neighbors and myself \n\n\" Oh I heard your cat running around up there playing with the ghost cat again.. \"\n\nWe would always laugh it off, and go about our life.......\n\nBut then, after a while I started to noticed a change in my cats demeanor.....\n\nInstead of greeting me with happy kisses n smiles upon getting home from work, immediately opening my door, my cat would wanna bolt out into the hallway in fear for her life..... I thought that was strange.... \n\n\nThen at points when I would feed her... Instead of her running up to the food, she would cautiously approach, look over both shoulders to make sure nothing was coming up on her....\n\n\nI thought that was odd... \n\nJust kinda been going about my life all year watching my cat sense something and her demeanor change... Just never thought anything......\n\nThen a few nights ago, I'm about to sit down and do some gaming, and I hear my cat ( who was laying down on the floor behind the couch ) let out these 2 defensive, stand your ground meows, like \" don't come any closer \" \n\nIt concerned me so much I turned around and said \" Aphrodite, what's wrong?!?! \"\n\nAnd I swear on everything I love, when I turned around and looked , I saw my cat being hoisted up into the air by something I could not see.\n\n\nHer arms were stuck straight up into the air, stiff, and it looked as if someone took her n violently shook her left to right, and she let out this insane \" MeeeoooOOOOOWWWW\" and I ran toward her like \" OMG APHRODITE!\"\n\nAnd as I am running to her I see what can only be described as an imprint in her fur.. like when you push your hand down on the bed sheets....\n\nAs I got a bit closer, I felt this insane energy, bum rush me and it felt like I got instantly kicked into a freezer.... All the hair on my arms went straight up, I got goosebumps..... Shaking cold.... Trembling....\n\nI say \" WHAT ..THE FUCK .. IS THAT..!?!? \" \n\nand now I swear my cat and I haven't been the same since .. it feels like some force has itself attached to me..\n\nLike I'm here but my soul is being held against it's will.... Super hard to explain \n\nMy family wants me to seek out medical help..... \n\n\nWhich I am.. cause I know they defies logic.. it's such an issue in my life right now I'm at the point where I hope they diagnosis me with schizophrenia or something so I can be medicated n move on..... And that's a powerful statement ...\n\nMy family thinks I'm hallucinating, but if I'm hallucinating, why is it effecting my cat? .\n\n\nI have video of her minutes after it happened and I'm standing next to her calling her name, and I keep getting louder until I am screaming her name.... And I get absolutely no response...\n\nSo again . What the fuck?\n\nSo I'm at the point where I'm hoping there is some logical, scientific explanation for all this, cause I truly have been watching my cat sense something all year.. never thought anything of it .. ..\n\n\nI wouldn't be on this reddit right now if I didn't turn around concerned over my cat making those distress calls . I'd be going about my life joking about the ghost cat ...\n\n\nBut here I am... Feeling like I am myself, but some outside force has me captive, and it wasn't ever like this until that moment I felt like I got kicked into a freezer........\n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated cause this is absolutely fucked ......\n\n\nThank you\n\nCATZ",

But I’ve recently noticed that I seem to get migraines when I enter certain historic buildings that immediately go away when I leave the room/building. \n\nAt my college I’ve started to feel followed in certain places and see figures in my peripheral vision in specific places.\n\nI’m only posting about this now because last night I kept waking up between 2 and 5am feeling watched and when I got up in the morning I saw that some of my books fell of the shelf and a poster fell down. \n\nI’m very confused and have only experienced a few hallucinations due to migraines but nothing like this, I thought it might all be in my head until one of my friends said she felt like there was someone right behind us and no one was there.

We were in an upstairs bedroom with the door closed. He took a drink of water before bed so I know the mat/bowl were in the normal spot. Husband was already asleep\n* Woke at 6:30 and found the mat/bowl moved to under the table.\n* Water dish was still full although there was a little spillage on the mat and at the original location. No water was found spilled/dragged between the 2 spots\n* My dog has never moved the mat/bowl in his 14 years of life.\n* The house was built in 1727 and we've only lived here 6 months. No signs of ghosts or hauntings so far\n* It's only me and my husband. Neither of us did this nor do we have a history of sleepwalking, mental illness, etc. Honestly, if we were sleepwalking, the stairs are so steep and rambling, we would likely break our necks.\n* We have carbon monoxide monitors.\n* We know there are mice in the basement\n* There is barely enough room between table or chair legs to drag the mat/bowl to this spot. They were moved 10 feet west from the original position and 2 feet south.\n* Nothing else in the house seems out of place\n* Doors were locked and bolted. (Original wooden bolts across each door. )\n\nOkay, other than ghosts, please help me figure this one out.",

Immediately my mother called me to tell me and it’s by far the most shocking thing I’ve ever had happen in the family. \n\nSo my family lives in the state of Colima in a town called Tecoman. My parents and I moved to the U.S decades ago now but we’re in contact with them everyday. Well today just a couple of hours ago, my aunt, grandma and 3 of my cousins were driving around doing some groceries. My grandma after doing a stop to buy some things noticed an old man having a hard time standing and looked like he would soon collapse. Immediately she walks over to maybe catch him if he collapsed but he stabilized himself. My aunt saw and got out the car and they both ask if he’s okay. He responds that he is but seemed lost. They offer to give him a ride wherever he needed to go but he kept insisting that he didn’t want to derail them from their trip almost as if he knew where they were going. Eventually after much convincing he asked to be taken to an address and they were on their way. He seemed to be a very nice guy, thanking them for the ride and saying how good of a person my aunt was. My aunt eventually asked for his name and when she heard it, it seemed familiar. One of my cousins suggested that maybe he was lost and decided to take some pictures of him and post it on her social media to see if anyone recognized. Shockingly none of the pictures were able to get him clearly even though they all have iPhones and only one picture got a picture of him but amazingly his face was blurred. Eventually my aunt remembered who the man was and asked him if he was related to a certain family. He said yes so one of my cousins decided to reach out to the old mans daughter through Instagram. While they were arriving they noticed that the directions seemed to be to graveyard. So my aunt decides instead to take him to his families home since he knew the family. Eventually they drop him off and on the way back they finally get a respond from the daughter. Come to find out this old man had died 5 years ago. We’re still in the process of finding out what happened and tomorrow my family in Mexico will meet with his family to make sense of all this.\n\nUPDATE* Sorry guys, I usually just read stuff on Reddit I never post anything but I got the Imgur link. The first picture is the best one they got and I’m not sure what the second one is or what the angle of it was. I’m working on getting more clarification and trying to get the rest of the pictures for those of you interested. My cousin is apparently to afraid to even open her phone gallery to see them",

Now to my story ....\n\nYesterday , after watching TV with my mother in the living room ( we were only me and my mother , as my sister her husband and her three boys have their own apartment in a town close to our village and they were not here that night) and when I felt like I want to go to sleep I told my mother so and I went to wear my pj's and sleep on my bed. I slept very well and I also had a dream of my late father hugging me and he was so alive in the dream , well ...at the morning as I woke up I thought I saw my nephew ( his name is Chris in english) standing at my bedside like he wanted to ask me to get up .....well I said not now boy let me some more minutes and I closed my eyes.....some minutes later I woke up , had breakfast and I watched TV as I do every day ( I have impaired hearing and I cannot do hard jobs because of muscular dystonia)  and I waited for my mother to come home from town where she was babysitting the youngest son of my sister at the moment. When she arrived at home and she prepared the lunch to eat together I told her about seeing my nephew on the bedside and she told me it is impossible because Chris did not slept that night on our home as he and his older brother Constantine had to attend school the morning.....so my mom said what I saw was a dream....due to my ear condition and stress I guess it was some kind of hypnopompic hallucination....our house has no history of haunting.....it was a mimic or a doppelganger?",

Hoping people here will understand where I’m coming from. \n\nUntil I moved earlier this year, I lived in an old flat (100+ year old tenement flat) and while I lived there I could always feel a presence of someone in the flat. \n\nI don’t know why but the presence I felt felt like a young boy with a pet of some sort. My partner and I could always hear small footsteps, and kept seeing shadows and noises of a cat walk and sit with us (we do have a cat but he really just sleeps in his bed 90% of the time.) \n\nThis “presence” did not feel aggressive or anything, actually whenever I felt the presence I was usually overcome with a feeling of calm and happiness.\n\nWhen we moved house I could no longer feel this anymore and I miss it. It was probably all in my head but it was a nice feeling. I just hope whoever is in our old flat now, the ghost or whatever it was feels at ease with the new owners. \n\n\nAlso, I must add that just before we moved my partner and I found some old archives from our town that had been digitised and posted online. It had details of an old cinema disaster in our town and an 8 year old boy who lived in our close/apartment building (not sure if same flat) died later on due to injuries sustained during the incident.  I wonder if his soul was somehow trapped in this building.",

I hurried to check the weather because I was scared we were being caught in a tornado warning but the weather was perfectly clear. We stopped at a waffle house in Kentucky 30 minutes later and I asked my mom and my aunt if they had heard it, they didn’t. I’ve never hallucinated before, never. It was bothering me until I was scrolling through tik tok and saw something about Sirenhead. I had never heard of it before and I wish I hadn’t. Highway 65 is surrounded by forest at least the part where I was at the time leaving Tennessee. If anyone has any similar experiences please let me know because I’m freaking out. A mutual told me it could’ve been a siren from something in the distance which is also very likely but no one else in the car heard it besides me.",

We were renting it to a friend and eventually bought it from them. Because we were good tenants never complain about anything about the house. But anyways we bought the house in 2021 we been living in it since 2016. Like I said I had some weird experience in the house by myself when I am home alone. I get the feeling likes someone is watching me and I hear someone running in the attic even though it’s a 1 story house ranch type. mom told me that they had a horrible experience yesterday. They were asleep when all of a sudden my father got woken up by a woman who demanded him to sing to her and he refused and waking my mother up and that she said that the woman got so mad she ended up hiding underneath a small table they have in their room and that the woman started to violently shake the table and a few minutes later it stopped. And they eventually went to sleep and prayed that night. And she told me that the our neighbor who have been living next to our home for a long time said that the previous owners had a accident that the wife had died in the master bedroom in which my parents are currently sleeping in.  And my little brother who sleeps with them always refuses to go in the room alone never wants to go in there by himself he claims that there is something there. And out of all of the rooms in the house that master room is the coldest one. Every time I try to lay down in there bedroom to sleep or relax the room suddenly gets cold out of no where. And I had also had two times sleep paralysis one was in my room but it was a dream type sleep paralysis but the second one felt real I had slept In my parents room and I had work that day and my brain told me that I was going to be late for work and that I had to get up but I couldn’t I tried to yell for help because my mom and my uncle where in the living room at the time but I felt I cold gaze stare on my left side of the body I was facing the right side and I tried hard to turn around all I could see at the corner of my eye was a woman with curry hair and I got real mad and scared at the same time because one I was late for work and two someone was staring mad hard at me until I eventually got control of my body I was ready to punch the person next to me but No one was there. I am not sure if it’s the same woman or not. I do believe my mom because they have also experienced weird things in their room. Sorry for the long as texted I just wanted to get it off my mind can’t sleep and I don’t want to dig any deeper about the past of my current home.",

I was staying with a family that had a lot of land and the did some sort of farming because there was a hay barn on the premises. All the kids in the home (about 4-5 at a time) would play Man Hunt (Essentially it's hide and seek tag) and the oldest boy convinced everyone to play after dark and he would be It first. I was always pretty good at hiding because I was smaller than most kids my age at the time and I decided I'd hide in the hay barn. I ran and ran as fast as I could because I could hear; we'll call the oldest boy Kevin, calling out that he was coming specifically for me first. He's maybe 13-15 and a bit of a bully. I got to the barn and dove underneath a machine used to bail up hay into stacks and for a moment I took a sigh of relief. I couldn't hear Kevin anymore so I started looking around the barn to make sure I was safe. I scanned all along the walls and when my eyes met a hook on the back wall all I could do was shut my eyes and tell myself it wasn't real. I saw the disembodied head of a farmer hanging on the hook, his skin grey and sagging... I felt my blood chill and the hairs stand end to end. When Kevin did find me, the look on his face told me that he knew I saw something horrible. I never played at night or went near that barn, every again.",

There is currently 5 of them who claim to be people who I knew in my childhood. Basically, they just hang around me all day, every waking hour, being annoying as hell, Hurting me, giving me headaches, toothaches, various bodily pains, back pains, muscle aches, and generally making me feel like crap, sapping all my energy. Throughout the day/night I smell various awful smells like feces, extremely bad B/O, bad breath, even semen.\n\nIn the beginning, it started out as just feeling like I was being watched, and sometimes I could feel a presence behind me. I had recently started to use meth, so I just brushed it off as drug related paranoia. This lasted for about 6 months or so until I did some stupid stuff and ended up in prison for 2 years, which is when things really amped up!\n\nI had been in prison for about 5 months, when one night a voice claiming to be someone I knew as a teenager started to talk to me. It started simple enough, just basic \"Hey, remember me? Remember this? Remember that?\" type of stuff. The same \"entity\" would also briefly pretend to be other people from my past. After a week or so another couple of entities appeared and started to talk to me. At first they would claim to be interested in me, but after a couple of weeks they started to harrass me. Badly. Every night they would threaten me, saying all sorts of nasty stuff. They would pretend to be other prisoners in the cell block, telling me that they hate me, they would bash me and I should kill myself. All sorts of vile stuff. They started to threaten and harrass me constantly. I wouldn't sleep for 4-5 days at a time because they would be there harrassing me.\n\nEventually, after 10 months or so things began to calm down and were mostly amicable. They would be there, trying get me involved in their little mind games, talking to me every waking hour, with the females of the bunch always wanting me to masturbate for them, or they were masturbating for me, or the other entities.  For the most part, I didn't want them there and would tell them and ask them to leave, but they would ignore me.\n\nWhen I got out of prison, things started to get worse again. A lot worse.. What appeared to be another entity joined them and this on liked to just me, and affect my breathing. All day and night they would give me toothaches, affect my respiratory system to the point I could barely walk up a slight hill and various other things they would take turns doing. \n\nThey are really having a huge impact on my life and I need to be rid of them!\n\nThe last couple of weeks I've finally been doing some research into what could possibly be happening, and for the most part they appear to be Astral Parasites, or with the sex stuff/masturbating, maybe succubus/incubus?\n\nSince i have been calling out to Archangel Michael/God for help they have calmed down a bit",

To our left is a large plot of farming land with loose dirt and to our right is a wired fence.

All figures were wearing bright colored shirts like red, yellow, orange shirts. All running full speed through the loose dirt towards the wired fence. Running on loose farming dirt is not easy and not possible to run full speed. All 5 figures ran towards the fence jumped over the 5ft fence on the first try without slowing down or thinking about slowing down to pass through the fence. Almost seamed like they jumped and floated over.\n\nWe lost sight of them after they jumped the fence. To scared to check the area of where they jumped. Just a weird experience. Want some feedback.

        "text": "So I don’t know if this is actually paranormal, but I wanted to share this experience with you guys.\n\nA while ago I was living far from my hometown while at uni. One day, I went to bed and I dreamed that my dad died. He got sick and he passed away. In the dream, I came back home and I was with my family, everything was extremely sad. I woke up, super worried, because it felt so real. I wanted to call my mom but it was super early in the morning. I couldn’t get back to sleep, but when it was late enough, I called my mom.\n\nI asked how she was and I told her what happened in my dream. She stopped talking for a bit and told me not to tell my dad about it. And so I did.\n\nYears later I remembered this, and I asked my mom. When I called her that morning, they were at the hospital because my dad woke up in the middle of the night because of an arrhythmia. \n\nCoincidence? \n\n👀",

Shortly after cleaning everything (the bulb sockets, mirror, walls, etc) I went to another room to play video games. When I turned my PS5 on it made it’s usual sound, but then something behind my tv mimicked that sound twice. It sounded small and more robotic, but almost perfect. There’s nothing in that room that can mimic anything or that really makes any sound on its own. Then this morning I hit my hand on something in the bathroom I cleaned and made that “sshhhhhhh” sound you make when you hit your head or foot or something and I heard the mimicking sound again. Sounded like me but smaller and robotic. After the first mimic I looked around the bathroom but saw nothing and the second mimic sounded like it moved around and flew out the window almost(?) \n\nI live in a coastal town in California. Not a big town but it’s the most populated in the area but still somewhat rural. Any idea what it could be?",

        "text": "I’m sorry if there are any misspellings but english isn’t my first language\n\nTonight i had the creepiest experience i ever had in my life.\nI was sleeping and around 3am i woke up, with a strange feeling that i was being watched. I looked over to the window and i saw the silhouette of a head watching me. Note that i live in an apartment at the 2nd floor, and i had LEDs on, so i’ve seen it clearly. I immediately panicked and jumped up the bed, looking outside the window and in every corner in my room, without finding anything. I waited a bit and then went back to the bed, trying to sleep. I had again the same feeling i had before, but this time there was no one, so i tried calling for my parents while in the bed, but i couldn’t speak properly, i could only mumble. After a while i managed to talk and i screamed “Mom help” a lot of times. I heard sounds coming from their bedroom so i thought they were coming, but soon as i screamed, the figure appeared in front of my bedroom door. It was a completely dark man, with a borsalino hat. At first i thought it was my mom, so as it started coming over the bed, i reached for the figure and took of the hat, jokingly saying “mom take off the hat, you seem like” and as soon as i said this, my blood freezed, and i was completely in shock, it was a total black figure. I couldn’t speak or move, so i just laid there in bed, as this figure crawled towards me. As soon as it reached her hands around my neck and it’s face in front of mine, my dad opened the door, and the figure vanished completely. My dad asked me what happened and i mumbled “i don’t know “. I stayed in the bed for a few minutes, and i went up to go to the bathroom. Everything seemed to be normal, so i went to my parent’s bedroom to ask them if they heard anything and make sure i wasn’t sleeping. They told me they heard me speak with a very low tone and then they heard my screams. I was creeped out and i slept in their room. \nNight went on good but i had a very hard time sleeping because i was creeped out.\n\nI’m not sure what happened or what it was, but i’m scared to sleep again in that room and still thinking about it makes my heart beat fast",

        "text": "There is at least one resident ghost where I work. I don't know if anybody who works there knows who it is, there have been lots of people with strong emotional attachments to the place. \n\nI had been working there for a few days when I mentioned seeing a ghost that kept making me jump thinking someone had wandered in during cleaning hours, which does occasionally happen. \n\nThe rest of the staff immediately confirmed there is a ghost, everyone sees him. Some people quit suddenly and I dont know if it's because they were unsettled by him, every encounter I've had has been nonthreatening. \n\nIt started out catching glances from across the room. Then I started seeing shadows pass across doorways when I knew nobody was in the room. \n\nThen I there was a day when the door of the bathroom I was cleaning opened and I saw a person out there, I thought it was a coworker then when I stepped out realized she was on the other side of the building. \n\nA few days later I came out of the same bathroom after cleaning and he was standing right on the other side of the door. I expected to run smack into someone but just passed right through him and he vanished, leaving me feeling very warm and calm. \n\nMaybe a month ago, I was in a room alone and he gave my ass a good squeeze and tickle. It's been a long time since I've been touched by an entity, and this is the first time one has goosed me lol\n\nI wasn't scared or offended, I thought it was hilarious and the second I got home I told my husband \"The ghost is getting really familiar.\" He asked \"Did he goose you?\" joking around and we had a good laugh when I confirmed it. \n\nA week or so ago, me and a couple coworkers (one female) and a (male) manager were chatting and the subject somehow got onto the ghost. \n\nThe female coworker said she'd been felt up, and another female had told her she's had her back touched and shirt gently tugged on in a teasing way. I told them about the ass grab. \n\nThe look on the manager's face was priceless lol He had plenty of firsthand experience with the ghost and had no reason not to believe us, it was just clearly the first time anybody had brought it up and he had no idea how he was supposed to handle it. Not like he can take the ghost into his office and give it a stern talking to about sexual harassment in the workplace lmao",

        "text": "Before I begin, let me just say this is a true story. I’m not really into paranormal stories or movies or anything because it freaks me out and I feel like it invites stuff to you. So I’m not the type to go write a creepypasta or anything. But here it goes.\n  \nSo just a few days ago I was at a grocery store with my baby in the cart. I was entering an aisle and from my peripheral I got a glimpse of a young looking man (maybe around my age which is 25). I was mostly looking at his profile but he had young smooth skin and a very sharp jawline.  And he was wearing a green bomber jacket.\n  \nHe was smiling at my baby so I knew he was about to look at me and address me (that’s how it always goes with people). So when he looks at me I realize that  he’s actually very old and has at least one bloodshot red eye. Like he just looked messed up and I honestly wasn’t even able to look at him too much.\n  \nHe said to me “hi, sweetheart” in an old voice.\n  \nI’m not a judgemental person and I love when people give my baby attention at the store. But I do follow my intuition almost to an obsessive/compulsive extent. My intuition was telling me to walk away. I felt uncomfortable.\n  \nI chalked this up to maybe he’s kind of losing it and might try to trap me in a long uncomfortable conversation. Let me just say, I didn’t feel afraid at all. I’ve felt what I think is evil before and I did not feel that from him. Just uncomfortable like his energy was overbearing and not something I wanted to be around.\n  \nSo I anyway, I smile in his direction and then keep walking. I actually needed something from that aisle but decided to loop around. So when I come back around to the aisle, he’s still there but he’s looking at the opposite side that I need to so I just go ahead and go into the aisle. As I’m looking for what I need, my baby starts making noises and I can sense him look at her. I turn around and this is where it gets weird.\n  \nThis guy now has the exact young face I saw on him originally. This time I’m looking at him straight on and clearly. He has young skin, no red eye, and he looks like a totally clean cut guy. Same exact jacket. Then he says something like “she’s so cute,” and he has a young voice!!\n  \nAfter I got home I realized the similarities between that first season of American Horror Story with the ghost maid who looked young to everyone except one guy who saw her as old with one red eye. That’s weird right?? I don’t think he was a ghost lol but like huh??\n  \nAlso, this guy looked like he could be from like the 50’s or something. Military green bomber jacket with some normal straight jeans and his hair had a deep side part with it combed over/gelled to the other side.\n  \nDoes anyone have any theories?",

        "text": "I don't really know where else to go with this story. I feel like when I try to tell it to people they're silently judging me for what I'm saying. This has been going on for close to a month now and I'm honestly getting scared enough to the point where I want to move.\n\nAbout a month ago I managed to find a new rental house to live in. I had previously lived with a roommate, but when she got married I moved out. The market is horrible, but I was able to find a two bedroom rental house for pretty cheap. It's pretty big with a very spacious back yard. I was lucky enough to find it. \n\nAfter a few days I got the impression that something wasn't right. I just got the impression that I wasn't alone. You know the feeling you get when you have eyes on you and stuff. Like no matter which room I was in I always felt like there was something staring at me. \n\nAs with other moves I've had, I had all locks changed. I don't chance a previous resident trying to get in. Also I have a Ring doorbell camera because the house is about a mile off the main road, so if somebody comes over unannounced, i want their faces documented.\n\nIt was about a week in when the activity in the house really started. I would come home to find cabinets and drawers open. As far as the cabinets go, there didn't seem to be any food taken or anytjing like that. Just open cabinets. Also nothing really seemed to have actually been gone through. I did stay with my boyfriend for a couple of days though after this happened because I was too scared to stay alone.\n\nNext thing I noticed was a severe temperature change. The house would be extremely cold despite not touching the thermostat. I would have to grab sweat pants and a jacket. Then it would become so hot that I would basically have to get down to my bra and underwear to stay cool. It was extremely uncomfortable. I had this looked at, but nothing was found wrong with my air/heating system.\n\nWhat got me the most was one night I was watching TV and suddenly I could hear a loud noise coming from behind me in the kitchen. I was extremely startled. When I saw what had happened, I noticed that it was a container full of my cooking utensils that had been knocked onto the floor. I was frozen with fear. I called my boyfriend to come stay with me for the night. Until he got here I just sat on the couch and cried. I didn't know what else to do.\n\nMy boyfriend and one of his friends did a sweep of the house and found nothing. Nobody could have entered. I have an attic, which we all checked. There was simply no way of entering the house. Even my windows are painted shut.\n\nSince that one night I have been finding myself waking up between 2 and 4 AM every night. No particular reason. But when I'm awake, I'm fully awake. Almost as if I hadn't gone to sleep at all.\n\nAlso, when I've been sleeping, I wake up to heat extremely loud noises. This usually comes as a door slamming or something being thrown. I did once walk into the living room to find a picture frame knocked over and a lamp on its side. When this kind of stuff happens I usually just sit there and try to regain my composure. If this is indeed something sinister, I don't want ot to see me afraid.\n\nThe main reason I'm typing this out is because yesterday I found a little purple bag tucked away in my closet. I almost had a panic attack when I found it because I once again had no clue as to what it was. I've just been a nervous wreck lately.\n\nThe bag looked like it was hand sewn. Inside were just some little rock fragments, some ashes, and what looked like maybe seashells (?)\n\nI didn't even want to think about what it could have been, so I dumped it into the trash and tore the seams of the bag. I didn't really know what else to do with it. I don't know if that's some weird voodoo bag that's been causing the issues, but I wasn't chancing it. If that didn't work then I'm just going to say screw my security deposit and then get the hell out of this house. \n\nAnyway, feedback is welcome. So is any form of rational thought. Please be kind.",

        "text": "(My brothers expierence)\nMy brother was telling me a story about our sister, and how one time he had been crying in the bathtub when he heard footsteps and our sister came into the bathroom with him. She walked in with her head down and then put both hands on the bathroom vanity and just looked into the mirror and asked him why he was crying- never looking at him and just staring into the mirror. He climbed out of the bathtub and went into his room and he never really thought about it again until he went to lunch with my sister and he asked her if she remembered that day and explained why he was in the bathtub crying. After he finished the story my sister was extremly puzzled and said she doesn't remember it all. He was about 6 yrs old at the time which made my sister at the time 12 yrs old, so for him to remember it so clearly and her not to remember it all was weird to him and after he shared the story with me and it brought up a weird memory with her as well. \nIn the same house that this happened to him, there had always been weird things about it (things being moved in front of me and weird feelings really), but this almost shared expierence took the cake. \n(My expierence)\nI lived in the back room of the upstairs in our house and along the hallway were 3 other bedrooms, but the room in front our stairway was my 2 younger sisters bedroom. I was painting in my room because the upstairs was finally quiet with everyone playing outside when all of a sudden I hear someone running up the stairs, so I went to see who it was; when I  opened the door and saw my older sister run into our younger sisters bedroom but she was wearing my favorite shirt. I immediately got upset and went into the room to yell at her but as soon as I yelled her name, no one was there. I called her name again and told her it wasn't funny and I want her to take my shirt off. I looked under beds, the closet, I ripped off the covers but still no one was there.. Feeling uneasy I went downstairs to see everyone was, my mom was the only one in the kitchen and I asked her where my older sister was only to find out she was down the street at a friend's house and had been gone for the last few hours. \n\nWhen my brother and I shared these stories we were immediately creeped out by the fact we had BOTH seen the same sister in completely different situations but she was actually wasn't there at all. We both felt the house was off but hadn't thought much about it until these scenarios happened to come out at a seemingly random time. As for our other siblings, we're not sure if any of them had seen or anything strange, as we're all a bit estranged and it'd be weird to just hit everyone up and ask if our old house was haunted. Another unusual thing is although were both 20+ and have moved several times/to different states, when we both dream of a house in our dreams, it's ALWAYS in that house. Sometimes the features of the home are slightly changed but as we move through the dream we're able to identify it's the same house we grew up in as kids. I've heard various paranormal reasonings as to how we could've seen her when it wasn't her, but never anything that felt concrete.",

Since the feeling wont leave i would just share it, maybe you have some ideas.\n\nToday i was driving home from work between 5 - 6pm and got stuck in some traffic and slow driving. As always i use that time to listen to music, make some phone calls or collect my thoughts. Now i was just slow driving and just thinking about some stuff going on in my life, till i suddenly felt something like a hand on my arm. (just below the shoulder) my first reaction was put my own hand in that exact spot and not feeling anything. I checked my mirror and just see the work junk on the back seats. The feeling of the hand was strangly comforting and unsettling at the same time. I think maybe a minute, or less later i get a cold chill down my spine and my car console completely froze up, which never happened before. \n\nWhile trying to shrug it off and continue on my drive back home i kept this weird feeling someone was with me in the car. \n\nIs this just my imagination playing tricks on me with a random event with my car or something else?
