        "text": " Another slow sunday at my curent workplace, so it is time to tell another story from back when I was working at \\[huge European Cable Provider that shan't be named\\].\n\nThe company just introduced an new reciever for cable tv/radio and the first few months after its release our team was the only team to support it. Most notable feature of the new receiver was the ability to output 4K, besides that it worked pretty much the same as the old ones.  \n\nAnyways, a few weeks after the release, a wild call apeared!  \n\nMe: This is $ISPsupport, What can i help you with?\n\n cu: I can't find my channel \n\nMe: What channel do you want to tune into? \n\ncu: $radiostation  \n\nMe: No problem, just tune into chanel $chanelnumber  \n\nCU: i cant find it \n\nMe: do you get some kind of error message?  \n\n CU: No, you misunderstand, i can't find the numbers on my remote. I'm blind.  \n\nFor for some reason the remote has a 2 by 6 layout for the number keys, instead of the old 3 by 4 he was used to. So i explained it towards the customer and had him finally change towards the radio station he wanted to hear. However, he was greeted by silence.  \n\nLuckily the reciever had a bit of remote support, so i checked the channel number. Sadly, the error messages are only displayed to the customer and can not be read through the remote support. So I, without knowing what error message came up, applied a fix for the most common problem and hoped for the best. I told the customer to call again if the problem still occured, but this time he should get some help to tell us the Error code.   \n\nAs this was a pretty odd story, I shared it with my a colleagues. A day or two later, a colleague approached me during lunch break to tell me that the blind guy called again. He still wasn't able to listen to his favourite radio station, but this time he had brought someone to help read the messagees on screen. So my colleague was able to tell him that the problem was most likely a bad wifi connection interfering with the 'always online DRM system' (Yes, I know) the Box used. So he told him to use an ethernet cable. In theory this should have fixed the Problem.  \n\nWell, theory being theory, of course new problems arose and over the next few days he called regulary with almost every error message in the book. Everytime we solved one, he got a new one.  The next time I had him on the phone I couldn't resist to ask, why the effin hell he got the new receiver, despite the old one never having any problems (his ticket history told me so).  Turns out a sales person told him the new receiver could be controlled by voice commands, wich was on the planned feature list. But it was to be implemented in about a year. So, while he was following the orders i gave, I hinted at our return policy as much as company guidelines allowed. So did many of my colleagues. After all, it wasn't his fault and he was a nice guy. \n\n After about 2 weeks and dozens of calls, the calls  suddenly stopped . I never found out  if he was finally able to get the damn thing working or if he just gave up. But to this day I curse the sales rep for ripping him off. \n\n **tl;dr**: blind guy got talked into getting the 4K cable receiver and is suddenly a beta tester, but only wanted a feature that would be implemented one year later.

        "text": "[As $GoodSister pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/patches765/comments/8wt8t8/languages_and_cultural_immersion_part_1/), I've been a bit busy these past two weeks covering vacation shifts. I do take vacation, but I can't take it at the same time as certain individuals due to coverage. This time... $Tunes... \n\n\nWhich is annoying on multiple levels. First, I miss $Tunes... we have wonderful, intellectual conversations on a variety of subjects. Second, it is kind of creepy being the only person on the floor for the last three nights. \n\n\nIt is finally slow at the moment. Time to get some writing in.\n\n\n**Holiday Coverage**\n\n\nYou know we had a holiday this week? I couldn't really tell looking at the maintenance calendar. Freaking hard moratorium and I was double booked... seriously? It was supposed to be ZERO. I was looking forward to writing.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, my entire department was supposed to receive a holiday lunch. One of the perks for working a holiday. Except... the person in charge (fairly new) completely forgot our department existed. Ok... shoot... \n\n\nExcept... I didn't bring a lunch... and I couldn't buy a lunch... because everything was closed due to... you know... A HOLIDAY. \n\n\nBasically, I was screwed. \n\n\nTo make matters worse, one of the maintenances went REALLY bad. Not my fault, I swear!\n\n\nI was granted permission to buy something... but would have to go downtown to do so. I would be away from my desk for about an hour... in the middle of working maintenances. Was not an option if I gave a damn about customers.\n\n\nMissing one meal wasn't going to kill me. However, management WAS made aware of the screw-up. \n\n\n**Access Denied!**\n\n\nWe had some transport gear fail in the field. The maintenance was an emergency card replacement. Fairly routine. Shouldn't have been an issue. Except... the alarms didn't look right to me. Transport is handled by a different group. I have zero visiblity to the gear or their alarming systems, but I can read their ticket worklogs.\n\n\n*Circuit Pack Mismatch*\n\n\nThat isn't a card failure alarm. That is something else. It just felt wrong to me. I told $Optical what I felt.\n\n\n&gt; **$Optical:** $Vendor said it is a failed card.\n\n\nSome how transport was still working, but it was definitely sketchy. I agreed that it needed to be fixed. A critical alarm was not something to be scoffed at.\n\n\n$Tech gets on site, and has problems accessing the building. He had a key card, but it wasn't working. One hour, fifteen minutes later, that finally gets straightened out. He now has access to the building. I should note, $Tech was an employee of the very same company that owned the building. A bit odd, but apparently there was a recent change made and not all techs were set up correctly. I'll just go with it.\n\n\nHe arrives at our cage. These at one time had card readers as well. Except, they were recently torn out and replaced with padlocks. $Tech was not informed of this recent change.\n\n\nWho has the combination? There wasn't any record of locks being on site. Another hour wasted to track this down.\n\n\nFinally, $Tech is able to view our equipment. And... $Vendor had him verify the critical alarms were active. THEN... they decided to have the card delivered. This was pre-ordered twelve hours ago. The courier was close by, but couldn't find a parking spot. He ended up just pulling in front of the building so $Tech can just grab it.\n\n\n&gt; **$Patches:** Now, don't drop it.  \n\n\nI don't think $Tech appreciated my joke. This card... would probably pay off my house. We aren't talking cheap gear here.\n\n\n**Definition of Insanity**\n\n\nTime to do my part. Most traffic we re-routed to other paths, and what remained were secondary. This should be quick and easy.\n\n\nPer $Vendor's instructions, $Tech powers down the gear, inserts the card, and powers it back up. Except... nothing is working. We only had a singal alarm come in through the management port.\n\n\n*Circuit Pack Mismatch*\n\n\nAnother power cycle.  \n\n\n*Circuit Pack Mismatch*\n\n\nNot good. Ok, due to the late start we were approaching the end of the maintenance window. Those secondary paths could not be kept down all night. $VIP-Group gets VERY cranky when they even have to go down for maintenance. They consider it an outage if they pass a certain threshold.\n\n\n&gt; **$Patches:** We need to attempt a back out. We don't have time for additional testing.  \n\n\nDue to the critical nature of $VIP-Group's data paths, no one except $Vendor argued with me. The original card (which was working before they toucehd it) was put back in and powered up.\n\n\n*Circuit Pack Mismatch*\n\n\nThe shelf was effectively hard down. It did not recover after the power cycle and $Vendor insisted the issue was the card.\n\n\n&gt; **$Patches:** $Vendor, I want to clearly state... I find it statistically improbible that a brand new card would have the exact same error as the failed one.  \n&gt; **$Vendor:** Oh, it happens. Occassionally you get a card that is DOA. We try to test the refurbished ones before they go out, but sometimes these things happen.  \n\n\nNow THAT was an interesting slip. He said it was refurbished. According to our contract, it was supposed to be new. Notes made for management's sake.  \n\n\n&gt; **$Patches:** Have you looked at the back plane or shelf? The alarm in question is indicating something else is there.  \n&gt; **$Vendor:** Why? What are you seeing?  \n&gt; **$Patches:** I don't have visibility to any of this equipment. That would be $Optical. I am just familiar with how things work.  \n&gt; **$Vendor:** Perhaps you should leave this to the people with experience.  \n\n\nI wasn't going to fight it. After all, this wasn't my gear. I just felt they were looking at this wrong.  \n\n\nTwo hours later (poor $Tech, I suggested he take a nap, but he was afraid to)... another card arrives.  At this point, the maintenance has turned into an outage. \n\n\n*Circuit Pack Mismatch*\n\n\n&gt; **$Patches:** Ok... come on, there has to be something else wrong.  \n&gt; **$Vendor:** It's rare, but two DOA cards can happen.  \n\n\nTwo hours later (once again, poor $Tech... he was struggling)... another card arrives. The outage got upgraded to higher visibilty.  \n\n\n*Circuit Pack Mismatch*\n\n\n&gt; **$Patches:** Really? Come on... There has to be something else.  \n&gt; **$Vendor:** I'm ordering a new card now.  \n\n\nThe irritation in my voice was definitely coming through. Some of my local support team expressed concern via IMs. Remember that holiday meal I didn't get? Yah... I was getting cranky, and it was starting to show.  \n\n\nI handed off to the next shift (was really hoping to see it completed), and headed home. I was already way past end of shift (and my shift is 10 hours long). \n\n\nAfter grabbing food ($Wifie's Korean BBQ experiment), and sleep, it was time to go back to work. The very first thing I did was follow up on the disaster of a maintenance.\n\n\nAnother card... and one more after that... A total of SIX cards were tested.  \n\n\n*Circuit Pack Mismatch*\n\n\nNot a single one worked. Then, $Optical (not sure exactly who on that team, since I wasn't physically present) noticed that about five minutes before the alarm, the equipment experienced a power hit. There were storms in the area, so this wasn't completely unexpected, except... no one looked at history. (Something that I do on every ticket.)  \n\n\nThis equipment had an interesting glitch that occurred during power surges, such as when power is suddenly turned back on after a power outage. It drops its configs on the shelf.\n\n\nAnd... wouldn't you know it? The default configs are looking for a card that hasn't been used in over five years. Which would give you an error similar to...  \n\n\n*Circuit Pack Mismatch*\n\n\nConfigs were restored from backup. Service came up immediately. Case closed.\n\n\n**Take Two!**\n\n\nThe night after the holiday was once again filled with maintenances even though it was a hard moratorium. Go fig. Another one... was IDENTICAL... to the issue from the night before.  \n\n\n*Circuit Pack Mismatch*\n\n\n&gt; **$Patches:** $Vendor, by chance are you the same individual who worked on a similar issue yesterday?  \n&gt; **$Vendor:** Yes, that would be me. I am the on-call all this week.  \n&gt; **$Patches:** Second question before I go back on mute. Will you be checking the shelf configs before ordering new cards tonight?  \n&gt; **$Vendor:** I just realized who you are... yes... and... Huh... Did this site lose power?  \n\n\nI was giggling at my desk. \n\n\n&gt; **$Optical:** Actually, the building was struck by lightning. Why do you ask?  \n\n\nI completely broke down laughing.  \n\n\n&gt; **$Vendor:** The configs are missing on the shelf.  \n\n\nAt this point, I had to excuse myself from the area and grab some coffee. Between lack of sleep and being slaphappy, I wasn't going to be much use on that call.\n\n\nWe had it fixed within the hour.\n\n\n**Just When You Think It's Over...**\n\n\nIt's close to end of shift... almost there... and... FIBER CUT! God, damn it! \n\n\nThe next shift wasn't in just yet. Let's ignore the part where there is supposed to be people scheduled one hour before I even leave. So, focusing  on customers, I worked the issue. Coordinated various groups, dispatch sent techs en route, breaks being identified, the usual.\n\n\nManagement, who were notified as part of the outage process, started asking very good questions.\n\n\n&gt; **$Manager:** $Patches, why don't you hand this off to day shift?  \n&gt; **$Patches:** They aren't in yet.  \n&gt; **$Manager:** Wait, what? It's past eight.  \n&gt; **$Patches:** I am very aware of that, sir.  \n\n\nI am not sure who was more pissed. Myself or my manager. This was Friday. The office should have been filled. And no one was in to release me.  \n\n\nI ended up getting out of here at a quarter to ten. I was not happy about it. Management was not happy about it. \n\n\nI still haven't received an explanation on what the heck happened there. It wouldn't be the first time a manager accidently gave an entire shift the day off. \n\n\n**Epilogue**\n\n\nMy buds from around the states checked with me the next night. They wanted to make sure I was feeling ok, because I just had two nasty nights in a row. I really appreciate that. I told them so. I also explained that I try to start each day off with a clean slate.\n\n\nStill... not much sleep this week.",

        "text": "Ok so I moved and got a new job at a big company (fortune 50). When I got the job it was a huge step up. I am now an engineer. I rarely take calls or do desk side support unless it is something weird or I have it scheduled. Yesterday, after a two hour architecture meeting I was walking back to my desk. The director for my division is wandering around my section (windows engineering). I ask him if he needs anything and he says he can't find anyone but I'll have to do (he reviewed my resume when I was hired and knows I did tech support). He says there is a Windows 10 problem with one of the executives. \n\nWe head over to the executive team. They explain the issue (constant lockouts from their windows 10 PC).  I am not above desk visits for software I customize and support. I rushed over. They tell me what's wrong and how to fix it. I fix it in 2 minutes (cleared credential manager). They look at me and say that was really professional and very good support for an engineer. I find out later that desktop support was only given 2 minutes to respond to a ticket before he went looking for me and that they knew how to fix it the whole time but wanted to see if the team knew. I missed my next meeting to go over requirements for a rollout for their test. I thought I was done with this when moved to engineering. \n\nDisclaimer: the drinking game suggested below is  fictitious and in good fun. It is not to be attempted for obvious reasons. You will most likely have a bad time and/or die. Last check was 28 mentions of the offending word. \n\nTldr got brownie points for being a good support representative while in engineering and missed an important meeting for a ridiculous test that wasn't even pointed towards me. When you leave the desk the work always seems to follow you. ",

        "text": "This happened several years ago, but I just wandered over here and remembered this story. Some of the details are a little hazy, but I'll try to fill in.\n\nI used to work in a helpdesk that serviced a couple thousand workers in a rather large, multistory office building. I haven't worked in IT for years since this place, and that's in part due to the clientele, one of which stars in this story. Due to the large ticket volume, our helpdesk was broken down into very specific groups, and I was one of maybe 5 people that mostly just took care of printer/MFD maintenance. Should be a relatively low-drama ticket queue, I thought when I started working there.\n\nI had been there for over a year at the time of the \"incident\", and knew just about all of the ins and outs of the office. In this case, make sure all of the printers in high-traffic areas don't have any tickets out on them before going out for a long weekend. Having done that, my team and I head out on a Wednesday afternoon to enjoy some holiday that I can't remember. I'm sure I had a good weekend, as I usually did when I didn't have to show up to work for longer than 2 days.\n\nI get back to work the following Monday and notice the helpdesk area (it's an \"open office\" workplace, we don't really have rooms) has scratches all across the tile floor. That's odd. I sit down at my desk and browse some vaguely tech-related news articles while my coffee kicks in before I face the ticket queue. I finish up and go check in with a coworker that usually picks up the big jobs first thing in the morning so that we can work them together and not have to lone-wolf it all day.\n\nThat's when I notice it. A big-ass Lexmark MFD with collating and stapling and large document and whatever else attachments, weighing in at probably 250+ lbs, sitting in front of his desk where it oughtn't be. With feet sitting neatly at the end of the floor scratches. \n\nHe chuckles and pulls up the ticket to show me.\n\n&gt;Department Head Such Andsuch (totally his real name, you can look him up! ^^/s ) had put in a ticket for a jam late Wednesday evening after most of the office had cleared out.\n\n&gt;Mr. Andsuch updated the ticket Thursday morning to bump it to the top of the queue and marked it Urgent. I believe he even noted that there was another nearby, but slightly less convenient, printer that he would use until the issue could be resolved.\n\n&gt;Updates it again Thursday afternoon, saying he called the office and received no answer. We put the on-call phone number in the voicemail for emergencies, and because he's a department head he has the (home) phone number for our department head as well. Neither of these phone numbers were called.\n\n&gt;He updates it once more Friday afternoon, notifying ~~the ticket system~~ us that since nobody had handled his ticket, he was going to come upstairs and have us fix it personally.\n\nThere were no further ticket updates. Only evidence.\n\nThis poor guy pushed the printer down a long basement hallway, into an elevator, back down the vertically adjacent hallway and into our office, only to find it completely empty. Did I mention we remove the casters from our large printers to dissuade users from relocating them to \"better fit their needs\"? The scratches along the floor extended the entire path he took, less a couple of carpet patches along the way, including into and out of the elevator that his bosses' bosses' boss takes to his/her office.\n\nWe laughed a bit more after having gone through the ticket history together. My coworker is more of a morning person than I am, plus he gets there an hour before me anyway, so he had already gone over the internals, cleared the jam, and replaced the maintenance kit for good measure. He was told to leave the offending paper and any parts with the unit in our office space for \"future reference\" by our department head.\n\nI don't think much came of the situation other than a nice, probably long-winded, verbal redressing of Mr. Andsuch, and he probably still works there to this day. We had a good laugh and a good story for the new people, and it didn't really inconvenience us much to put back in place. Mostly because of the large flatbed cart we keep in our space a few feet from where he left the printer.",

Important note: the ticket system is all online through an internet facing page (not intranet, internet) as some tickets are raised by outside contractors and remote users. \n\nuser: ticket open - printer not working every day\n\ntech: ticket response - more information required, printer location and do mean the printer is broken and not working?\n\nuser: the printer is located downstairs in the warehouse, and it will print for the accountant and then everyone else but the next day it will not print until the accountant prints again\n\ntech: thank you for the info, I am heading to that printer now. will update ticket with result soon\n\ntech: ticket response/update with resolution.  found that accountant was plugging in the previously networked printer via USB to laptop which was then shared via windows network share. removed cable and networked printer to LAN cable. tested printer via LAN and all works ok. Ticket closed.\n\n\\~1 hour later\\~\n\nUser: ticket re-open - printer not working every day. \n\ntech: this issue was already reported and fixed earlier today, can you confirm this is the same issue with the same printer in the warehouse?\n\nuser: yes, and it does not print any day that accountant is out.\n\ntech: as per above ticket response, this issue has been fixed and the printer was tested to be working. Please open a new ticket if there is an issue with your workstation not printing. Ticket closed.\n\n\\~30 mins later\\~\n\nuser: ticket re-open - printer not working every day\n\ntech: is this that same issue with the ware house printer again? if so, can you please confirm that your workstation is the only one with the problem or is anyone else having the same problem. \n\nuser: yes, my workstation is having the issue. \n\ntech: is anyone else unable to print? it might just be an issue with your workstation. I will come down to your computer and see if it is a local problem or the workstation itself. as the printer has been tested as working on the network I will close this ticket and create a new one if your workstation still has an issue. \n\ntech: update/resolution - tested workstation of user when user was not present (whole office was on lunch break) tested network printer located in warehouse. test successful, no issue found. ticket closed.\n\n\\~1 hour later\\~\n\nuser: ticket re-open - printer not working every day\n\ntech: can you please confirm if this is the issue as report as the start of the ticket history? the warehouse printer?\n\nuser: yes, i can't print to that printer until the accountant prints. I really need to get this fixed because the accountant is going away for all of next week.\n\ntech: this printer has been has been tested as working on the network, and your workstation has been tested as working to that printer. Can you please confirm that you will be at your workstation so that I can come to you and see this issue you are having?\n\nuser: no, i am not at work today, I am at home. I have been sending my printing to the accountant that sits in the next desk to mine and he takes is laptop to the printer for me. I need to be able to print when he is away. \n\ntech (internally screaming at the sheer disconnect of logic here): in order to print to that printer you would need to be connected to our network internally, for example, from your workstation. when you are in the office please test the printer from there, if you still have an issue you can raise a ticket. ticket closed.\n\n\\~5 mins later\\~\n\nuser: ticket re-open - thank you, I will try that when I am back at work next week.\n\ntech: ticket closed.",

        "text": "Hello TFTS. LTL; FTP, etc. Also, english is not my native language, so if I mess something up, feel free to point it to me and I'll correct my mistakes. TL;DR. at the end.\n\nLet's start with a little background.  My last job was a mix of audiovisual, events and integration work and I covered a lot of ground between those. For this specific tale, let's just say I was employed by a company that was a subcontractor to a subcontractor to a big telecom company (Big Telecom) that sells comprehensive videoconference systems (from monitors to backend infrastructure). This is about one of the first installs we did. Since we were the ones that installed the devices in the VC room that today's story is about, we were the ones sent when something happened.\n\nThe setup in this room vas what we called a vanilla setup: two monitors, a camera placed between them and a codec hidden behind one of the monitors.  This setup implied that if you wanted to display someting on the TVs, you had to go through the codec. Note that.\n\nNow to the actual story:\n\nA user from the client company called their inhouse support, that then called Big Telecom, that called... well you see were this is going. There was something wrong with the camera. They said it wasn't moving or responding to commands sent with the system's remote.\n\nI was assigned the job and as I read the problem description, I thought that somehow the little servos powering the camera had been disabled as they would do so when someone manually (as in with their hands) move it.\n\nTurns out I was right.\n\nWhat I didn't expect was to find a whiteboard marker *wedged* in the camera yoke, effectively blocking its movements. Some user decided that the camera pointing towards them while presenting content was annoying. Instead of using the remote that was in **plain view** on the conference table to have it pointing somewhere else, the used the next obvious solution. A whiteboard marker.\n\nI restarted the codec and the servos where working again.  We still laugh about this one to this day.\n\nHope you enjoyed my story. I have a few more where that comes from.\n\nTL;DR: Cameras are annoying!",

        "text": "Related to my previous [tale from tech support ](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8srhto/sorry_was_that_server_important/) I was going through the email settings for 2 of my client systems. One was heavily reliant on EWS and as such was highly tested by the client before use, the other system used the exchange as an SMTP relay - solely for sending canned and SSRS reports to local users, as such SMTP relay beyond their domain was not allowed. \n\nI had gone through the code bases for both systems, and the backing SSRS setups for both systems to ensure the new mailbox was being used. The last step was to test my changes; the EWS reliant app worked perfectly well, reading mail and sending it. \n\nAs the SMTP relay was blocked outside of the domain, I could only send it to our account mailbox, which was fine as it was an account set up solely for our Application to use. \n\nI tested each instance of our system, sending a sample report to our mailbox with the subject line \"Hello Friend\".  Each system worked, I reported to the client they were ready for testing and head off home for the weekend. \n\nMid-day Monday a support ticket comes through with some high urgency from our client, we think our mailserver has been hacked. With my curiosity piqued I read the ticket. Something along the lines of - \n\n&gt;\"our administration mailbox received an email *from itself* and the text of the email is somewhat concerning. It contains a singular line which says 'Hello Friend' - what is more worrying is that they seem to have been trying to collect data contained within $ReportIwasTesting\" \n\nSo it turns out that $CNA had set up a rule in our mailbox that any mail sent to our exchange account was automatically forwarded to the business admin's inbox, not only that but the same identity was used for both accounts - so unless you looked at the mailto address you wouldn't see it was from our inbox. \n\nSuffice to say I found it hilarious having to explain to a very worried team that the mail was from me; and that \"Hello friend\" just how I talk. \n\nGlossary\nEWS: Exchange Web Services\nSSRS: SQL Server Reporting Services",

        "text": "Previous story from the silly datacenter in the middle of nowhere [here](https://redd.it/8w494i).  By request, I have one more to share from this place.  Will try to cut down the ramble (yes, this was longer), add more four-part harmony and feeling.\n\n**Background** - My career so far has been a series of IT gopher positions, where I have learned near every subject in depth because no one else could or would.  My previous job had a large database oriented system... lets call it DB600.  Biz had bought this app to run on, but the system was an arcane and magical black box to all the muggles.  Once I came on as gopher, I got shown a dinky SQL prompt and was told \"make all the reports\".  So I learned SQL, and I did.  Lo, the gopher became the wizard, I pried many secrets from the arcane DB600, and I was even modifying the core app and writing simplish programs (lets call the language \"BFG\", it amuses me).\n\nWith all my ad-hoc learning though, I was pretty much a competent amatuer.  I longed to learn the \"right\" ways, from real pros.  Thus my pilgrimage to the datacenter, who had a DB600 that needed overseeing, and the holy mages of programming, who said \"Shaddup kid, you don't know anything, and we're too busy to babysit, so do what we tell you and dont touch our stuff.\"\n\nLe sigh.\n\n**Here we go** - The operator gig on DB600 used a simple custom tool to process and log incoming backup and job requests, sending pop up messages to let us know what needed doing and telling users to get out.  It didn't control the entire system, just the part they wanted more order on.  Maybe a year or two in, said tool starts losing jobs here and there.  We'd get an incoming notice, acknowledge it, and then just find nothing available to run.  We work around it, or user resubmits.  Time goes on, problem gets worse.  Problem gets documented, system programmers take over.\n\nTheir response:  \n- The problem is caused by duplicate records in the tool's history database. (er, how'd they manage that, but ok, yeah, sure)  \n- To correct the issue, we need to purge out of date records from the history. (OK, keeping this year and last year, uh huh, got it)  \n- Ops team is directed to use the tool to manually remove these records.  (*thud*)  \n\n... The tool does have a function to view history, page by page, and remove entries, one by one.\n\nMy jaw dropped.  I checked my understanding with my $coworker, and his jaw dropped.  We asked for clarification, and got it.  They seriously wanted us to go through some 7-8 years of history and purge the history file line by line.\n\nBeing a dutiful sort, my $coworker started.  I helped streamline where we could, but at our best guess, with one person dedicated on it, we *might* get done in two weeks.\n\nThe more I saw him work it, the more the monotony, the repetitiveness,... the sheer *stupidity* crushed me.  *There was zero reason to do things this way in a database system*.  I absolutely knew that.  I hadn't heard of any crush project or programmers burning the midnight oil.  The only logic would be keep-our-tape-slingers-busy, or just plain spite.  And I got pissed about it.  More pissed I got, the more I indulged my unprofessional side and put my wizard hat back on.\n\nNeed more info.  \nWhat database is this in?  \nCheck $coworker session locks.  He's using the same $TOOLDATA tool always uses.  \nSo there's not a \"history\" file, just one file. Tool must present a view for new jobs and a view for old jobs.  \nWhat can I find out about this file?  \nNo access to that.... No, not useful.... Ah! Here's the file layout!  \nJust the fields we see in the tool.  Submitted timestamp, job number, user details, release details...  \nJob number is the index field?  8 digits long.  Even I know the system re-uses them eventually. Not a timestamp, or a combo?   \nNo wonder \"duplicates\" popped.  Bad design from the start.  \nStill can't work the file though.  I need the data too.  \nStart \"BFG\" tools... access denied, not surprised.  \nStart data file utility... access denied.  \nStart query manager... access denied. *sigh*  \nStart SQL tools... access denied.  \nStart dinky SQL prompt.... HELLO WORLD.  Careful now, step by step, don't screw up.  \nSELECT * FROM $TOOLDATA;... its all there.  Only diff between old records and new records is release timestamp.  Scroll through a lot to make sure.  Can even see the recorded job numbers cycle back to 0000, two or three times since this record started.  \nSELECT * FROM $TOOLDATA WHERE SUBMITDATE &lt; lastyear;...  review data rows again, slower, to make absolutely double-sure I caught only what fit the purge criteria.  \nHey, $coworker, stop that and back out of the tool a moment.  \nChange SELECT * to DELETE.  Try not to flinch.  Hit enter.  \nStart up tool.  Check history.    \nI just saved us weeks of useless stupid busy work, by spending a little over an hour learning their setup.  \nDocument steps taken and inform.  \n\nSupervisor calls me over later that day to issue me a formal written warning, approved by everyone upstream, for failure to follow instructions (absolutely true), and failure to use test environment to test my solution (true, but bullshirt, we werent even given logins for it).  $Coworker thanks me profusely.  Double-check two days later, yep, locked out of dinky SQL prompt.  \n  \nWorth it.  ",

        "text": "Hi everyone!  LTL FTP, the usual... \n\nNot too sure if this tale fits here, as it is technically not \"tech support\" I was providing, but was mostly explaining how tech actually works or not works... If you like this, I got tons more.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not actually tech support, but handle all cloud computing topics for a startup, from the ETL processes to the DBs and writing up the queries other departments use to actually utilize the massive amount of data we collect. Technically I do this because nobody else can, my officially a \"Product Manager\"\n\nBit of background of the company:\n\nWe market browser and mobile apps that are free, but allow users to spend money on premium services. our products are available all over the world and are used by a lot of people. Company has been around for some 8 years. I've been working here for over 7 years now and, apart from the CEO and one finance guy, have been with the company the longest.\n\nThis tale took place in late 2014. Since we are an EU based company and do all our business online we were dealing with some VAT (value added tax) changes that would come into effect January first 2015 for all EU members. Basically what the the changes entailed was that we could no longer slap the VAT of our home country on all our sales and report to our tax authority anymore. Instead we'd have to determine where someone lives based on a list of criteria (which were not specified), and pay the VAT of their home country instead.\n\nCue the actors for one of the most infuriating meetings I have ever had to attend:\n\n**$Me**: take a guess          \n**$HOF**: Our head of finance, generally clueless about technology though she worked in tech companies all her life          \n**$PTL**: Pregnant Tax Lady, our tax adviser, probably 8 months pregnant at the time, thinks the internet is some kind mystical mumbo jumbo. Has worked with us for 3+ years at this point.          \n**$DPG** Data Protection Guy, cued in via phone because I demanded him to listen in. Knows his stuff but makes things way too complicated most of the time. (getting paid per hours must be nice)\n\n\nDiscussions were already underway.\n&gt; **$HOF**: So, we need those criteria to figure out which country people are from, which ones should we use **$PTL**?\n\n&gt; **$PTL**: Easiest would be to use their address, that is more than enough.\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Like IP address?\n\n&gt; **$PTL**: No their physical address.\n\n&gt; **$Me**, sighing internally: We don't have that in 99% of the cases, as we do not ship physical goods. Would the IP also work?\n\n&gt; **$PTL**: What's an IP address?\n\n... she has worked with us, an online company for 3+ years... I explain it in as simple terms as I can.\n\n&gt; **$PTL**: Hmm, maybe, but is that accurate?\n\n&gt; **$Me**: As long as nobody uses a VPN, fairly accurate yes.\n\n... cue me trying to explain what a VPN is for some 10 minutes until DPG chimes in.\n\n&gt; **$DPG**: I just checked and we cannot store the IP address for that matter.\n\n... long discussion with me suggesting things that might actually work, always getting shut down by **$DPG** or **$PTL** for reasons beyond my comprehension. Meeting has been dragging on for close to 1.5 hours at this point.\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Okay, what else we got... I could use the Random_kpi1, currency paid and cross reference that with the payment provider chosen. We also let people choose the \"server\" they want to connect to which technically represents a country. That makes the minimum of four criteria we need for this, right?\n\n**$PTL** just looked at me for a moment, I was 99% certain she did not understand anything I had just said.\n\n&gt; **$PTL**: Yes, that sounds good.\n\nSome typing and mumbling can be heard from **$DPG**\n\n&gt; **$DPG**: Sounds good to me, no data protection issues with that.\n\nI give HOF a long look, wondering if she realized I was basically grasping for straws by now. The criteria I stated are basically anything from conclusive for determining where somebody lives. But hey, **$DPG** had shut down anything I came up with that would have been conclusive by saying we could not do that because of Data Protection laws.\n\nI just want this to be over with and get to work on the actual problem by now, so people stop asking me when it will be done (yes, before the how is decided....)\n\n&gt; **$HOF**: Great! Seems like we finally have a way to do this! Think you can write all of that up **$Me** and send it to **$PTL** and **$DPG** so we can get written confirmation that this is a valid process?\n\n... She looked at me, and I realized she also had no clue what I just said.\n\n&gt; **$Me**: Sure thing, you'll have it in an hour.\n\n... Unable to believe just what happened I write out the email and send it off. Sure enough the next week I get confirmation. Mail gets forwarded to investors to show we are working on stuff. Investors gets interested in process. Big Auditing Girm gets hired to have a look at the processes we build. They take 2 weeks to go through all of it, interviewing me (telling them the data is fairly arbitrary and not really 100% accurate) and the analytics guys (telling them the same). \n\nSurprisingly, they got no complaints whatsoever. We get official letters signing off on the process and I begin implementation. \n\nThis system has been in production since late 2014, with minor tweaks. It's accepted by all European tax bodies we report to and we have passed every financial audit thrown at us so far. The analytics guys and I still cannot believe that we actually got through all this given the nature of the data passed along.\n\nedit: some typos",

        "author": "Hikaru1024",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8wfzz0/the_restaurant_pos/",
        "text": "To begin, I feel a bit out of my depth making a post here. My skills in your field are mediocre at best, I have not been to school and been trained, nor have I held a job in the industry.\n\nThat being said, I have had a few wacky experiences trying to help friends, family, co workers and in a few exceptional cases did what I might call 'consulting' for discounts or gift cards from businesses, as I sometimes found myself on friendly terms with people who had absolutely no idea what they were doing. This is one of the latter stories, and as requested I've decided to make a post out of it.\n\nSometime ago, my favorite restaurants owner asked me to look at their register. Their POS terminal was glitchy, and no longer covered by the company they'd bought it from - that company wanted them to pay for a new subscription for software and totally new machines for what seemed to be shockingly absurd amounts of cash. Googling showed that the company was now devoted 'to the cloud' and had 'upgraded' everything to keep all of your data on their servers.\n\nSo I dug into trying to figure out what exactly could be done about this. The hardware they had was very old, custom made, and the software was mated to it. The thing ran on top of some version of windows XP, - fortunately this was while XP still had support - but there was no guarantee that it'd actually function if I imaged the disk and stuffed it onto a new machine. I wasn't able to find almost anything out about the hardware nor the software that ran on it - the company had kept things very close to the chest and did *not* like anyone modifying anything, ever.\n\nThe hired help and owner kept talking about how the software required a server to run everything which is why it had to have an internet connection. Putting 2+2 together in my head made me realize this thing might be validating the license vs the hardware, so if I touched anything at all, even if I tested a new machine with an image of the old one, it might break for both new AND old machines permanently.\n\nSo I decided lets NOT touch the black box full of magic yet, and ask some stupid questions.\n\nFirst, what exactly did this register *do* and why was it so critical? Couldn't they just replace it with another company's (possibly) less insanely expensive product?  Turned out this wasn't simply a pretty register. It handled all the scheduling for the employees, kept track of all of the things the business needed to buy and all of their sales, and *absolutely everything they had ever done*.\n\nSecond, where is this mysterious server that they kept talking about, as if we could find *it* and find out what *it* was running, we could find something that might work with it instead of the glitchy POS. I got confused stares and shrugs. Nobody knew *what* a server was, just that it had been a requirement along with an internet connection for the POS. So I walked the cord from the POS through the store to the... DSL modem?!\n\nResidential DSL. And it's the *only* wired connection. Boggling, I ask around if they've got any computers they keep on all the time, maybe in a closet or closed space - nope. Owner owns two laptops they give to his kids, hired help uses phones and they allow customers to use the wifi. The question nagged at me, the POS terminal had to be saving its data *somewhere* - but if it was just a terminal where is the server?\n\nOne night they allowed me to watch as they shut everything down, and showed me how they did the nightly backup. Which... They canceled. I objected and asked them why they cancelled it, and they explained they had to. They cancelled it because the subscription was expired, and so they were no longer allowed to backup the database to the *server*.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAiee! I'd found the mysterious server I was looking for was right in front of me. The terminal *wasn't* a terminal at all - it held *everything* important. There are **NO** backups!\n\nAlthough I tried to explain, the owner couldn't understand why cancelling the backup every single day meant they *had* no backup. He had no plan, and mocked the idea that the register was going to eventually fail saying that he'd have to shut down the business if that happened. Worse, he wouldn't stop the employees from web browsing ON THE POS. I started paying with cash only after that.\n\nEven before I found out the POS was where all the important data was, I did *NOT* want to mess with the thing, but now I absolutely wasn't going to. I told him outright I wouldn't even try and that he needed to either cough up the cash for the new contract, or get someone familiar with the software and hardware to figure out a better solution.\n\nThe owner chose to do nothing.\n",

        "text": "Background: IT Manager (read:only IT) at a medical practice with many, many doctors and specialties). \n\n\nAt the request of one of our dentists, I set up TV screens in every patient room to act as both TVs and secondary monitors where the doctor can show the patient images, such as Xrays. To facilitate this, I connected each TV to each computer via HDMI as a second monitor, and purchased Hulu with live TV.\n\n\nThe job of the assistants is to, in the morning, open up Hulu via a desktop shortcut, and then pick whatever the patient wants to watch (invariably either ESPN or masterchef reruns). Relatively simple, and they all know how this works. Where I ran into problems is with the dual monitor set up itself. \n\n\nToday, I had the following conversation with one of the assistants:\n\n\n$A: “This computer’s mouse doesn’t work. I don’t see the arrow. ”\n\n\n$me: “Well, it’s on the second monitor. Just move the mouse all the way to the right like I told you to and you should see the pointer.” (I can’t just lock the cursor to one of the monitors because that involves hotkeys to lock and unlock the cursor, and they have no idea how to use that)\n\n\n$A: “I did that. Still can’t see it.”\n\n\nSo this I have to see. You know, that wierd tingly feeling you get sometimes when you know you’re about to see a mindboggling display of computer illiteracy? Yeah I got that. I get up from my comfy office chair and go down 3 flights of stairs to take a look.\n\n\nI get there, and she tells me it’s all good, and that the doctor helped her out. So ask what happened. \n\n\n$A: “I was moving the mouse to the right.”\n\n\n$me: “That’s what I told you to do.”\n\n\n$A: “yeah, but you didn’t tell me to drag it. I just picked up the mouse and moved it as far to the right as I possibly could. I even undid the velcro that makes its wire shorter.”\n\n\nI’m reconsidering the hotkey idea. Maybe that’ll actually make things easier. \n\nFace...meet palm. \n\nTl;dr: dual monitors confuse a dental assistant\n\n",

        "text": "I work IT support at a primary school and, due to some previous experience teaching, have been helping teach digital technologies with some of the less technology-confident teachers, along with the dedicated digital technology teacher. \n\n\nMost of the teachers are responding really well to this, and have really tried to take the opportunity to improve their own knowledge, but by the end of the semester they were all a bit stressed and just over the whole thing. This is a short story about the substitute teacher that was a breath of fresh air on a difficult day. \n\n\nAfter teaching a lot of computer basics last term we moved on to some Scratch projects. The kids were pretty excited about this and we spent a few weeks on it. \n\nBy the end it was getting a bit tedious but the kids enthusiasm helped keep us going.\n\nOn one of the last days we were teaching one of the hardest parts and I happened to be the lone IT technician that day as my coworkers were away. This meant I had to pop in and out a lot to make sure I was on top of everything else too. This made for an extra stressful day. \n\n\nIt was the last class of the day and we'd already had these kids before lunch for an hour. Their teacher had left for the day thus we had a substitute teacher (ST) helping us for the rest of the day. \n\nAs the kids are coming in, we talk to the ST and hand her the instructions, 16 pages long. This is usually when the teacher flips through it, gives us a confused look before saying they probably won't be much help. \n\n\nToday was different, I pointed out which pages we were working on today. ST had a bit of a read and after a little she said \"I have no idea what you're doing or what this program is, but I can read and follow instructions!\"\n\n\nNever had we had a more helpful teacher, we got though all we needed to and more. The kids listened and enjoyed themselves. ST seemed to have fun and learnt a thing or two too.\n\n\nTl;dr: After a hard day teaching Scratch programming, a substitute teacher says she can read and follow instructions, proceeds to be exceedingly helpful in teaching Scratch programming for the rest of the day, despite a lack of knowledge.\n\n",

        "text": "So the EVP over sales recently got a new PC and had immediate issues with it. We, in the IT Support area, never knew about the issues. \n\nToday I get an email demanding my attention at a meeting in the main corporate headquarters 10 miles down the road from the IT facility. I drive over there and immediately walk into the meeting 10 minutes early.\n\nAll of the execs, VPs, higher ups, supervisors, and I believe one guy eating popcorn all showed up to watch me get roasted. \n\nThe meeting started out very confrontational with everything directed at me about some issue I had no clue about and some VP who I never met who was pissed her issue was not resolved. Ill skip the preamble and go straight to the head desk. \n\nAfter proving beyond a shadow of a doubt, by calling the CIO directly and putting him on speakerphone, I took a look at the issue. \n\n&gt; $DVP = Dumb VP  \n&gt; $Me = Algernop Krieger\n\n&gt; $ME - So you are missing files since getting your new PC?  \n&gt; $DVP - Yes. I thought one of the reasons we got citrix was to prevent these kinds of issues.  \n&gt; $Me - I can go ahead and look at this to see where you files went. (30 seconds later) Umm... your citrix profile is completely empty. Is your username $DVP?  \n&gt; $DVP - Yes, but you wont find anything in there as I don't use citrix. \n\nFreeze frame. Full stop. Queue the word music from ff7 after Meteor had been summoned. \n\n&gt; $Me - So you dont use citrix at all?  \n&gt; $DVP - No. I hate it, its slow, it reduced my productivity, and generally is not a good experience to use.  \n&gt; $ME - So why would your files be transferred over from one PC to another if you never used citrix?  \n&gt; $DVP - Citrix makes backups of all files. You said so yourself in your email to me 3 years ago.  \n&gt; $Me - Well I was not with *our company* three years ago but I do know the email you are talking about. That only counts for files inside citrix.  \n&gt; $DVP - I do not understand what you mean.  \n\nSeveral people around the room did not either. The more technically inclined did. Several eyes focused on me like a laser while several more started rolling. The guy eating popcorn was eating his popcorn at cartoonish levels now. \n\n&gt; $ME - *Does not even hide his exasperated sigh.* Imagine this. Say you did not have an office assigned to you.  \n&gt; $DVP - I fail to see how...   \n&gt; $ME - Just roll with it. Imagine that every day you had to go to a new desk. Also every day you carry around a box with you with all of your office supplies. Now what goes inside the box, stays in the box for you to use. What is outside the box, is lost when you change desks.  \n&gt; $DVP - oooookaaaay?  \n&gt; $ME - Citrix is that box. Your files are those office supplies. Because you did not use citrix, your files are still on your old PC. I would need that before I can do anything at all to assist you with it.  \n&gt; $DVP - Ill have to make a call.  \n&gt; $ME - Make it. \n\nShe calls facilities who brings the old laptop up to me. I hook up an external drive to it and startsimply xfer the non appdata side of her local profile and merged it with her new local profile. Its been 6 years since my last local profile transfer. \n\nThe CIO had made it down to the building by this time and was sitting in on the meeting... where I was performing live tech support for a much smaller crowd and the one guy still eating popcorn. (That bag was bottomless)\n\nThe local profile xfer went perfectly, I removed all old shortcuts that were to old 2010 office programs and cleaned up any duplicates she had on her PC. \n\nAt the end $DVP questioned CIO on why this took 4 days to fix. The CIO said he send an email over to the server guys as soon as he got it. They responded with the news that she never used citrix and to contact IT to do a local profile transfer. $DVP never responded to the email and magically thought my dept would be able to read her emails. \n\nIn the end the CIO thanked me for my work and told me he would try to get this to our team first since that was company policy.

        "text": "**Update/Correction:** Due to my goofup of the title, it was not until 1:20pm the next day, it was 1:20am the next day, in the morning, night has already set, and in bed by 2am. For all those who wonder, against the opportunity my boss gave me of sleeping in, I still went to work the next morning.\n\nI work in a (small) computer and network, management and repair, shop. About a dozen of us, nine of us actually techs. We're not in a big city, or big town, just big enough to have a college and a few restaurants, so we travel a lot for clients (home visits or companies), when we absolutely can't do it via remote desktop.\n\nMy role, besides general computer support and projects, is VOIP work. Other than my boss, I'm the go to guy. I've been asking for an assistant at least. We setup clients with a server that manages all their voip (network based) phones in their building, with a couple clients that use a vpn with their phones for their satellite (other towns) locations. The server then connects to a voip service to use with one or more phone numbers.\n\nNot counting this week, the last two weeks I had installed two new phone servers, one of which included new phones, while the client reused their old VOIP phones (their previous VOIP provider was, well...), which I had the luxery of reprogramming each on site during install, majority of the server OS install and setup is done in house. Before the two installs for about a year, I've been working on other installed phone systems. Occasional requested changes, answering questions, fixing issues, and updating the systems. About this time last year was our previous server install and setup, and one the year before. Frequency of installing systems is not that great. Normally it takes about a couple weeks after a system install for the dust to clear and change requests come to a crawl for each client.\n\n*Now for the fun part of the story.*\n\nI get a call at 4:15pm. One of our older clients calls about their phone system. It was installed two to two and a half years ago, then replaced with a new machine a year later due to hardware issues. Their calls were coming in and out just fine in the morning, acting strange the afternoon until they couldn't make calls, then once it cleared up, they gave us a call. \n\nAfter an hour of trying to remote into the system, same method I've always had, I couldn't get a webpage to load up, or SSH to go beyond asking a username, just instant disconnect. Confirmed with our network firewall techs that I'm not being blocked or the like. Contacted the client and asked if they could force a reboot the system, as I wasn't able to from our end. 15 minutes later, everything was still down. Network switch shown the server's port was in use, so the system was on, at least, but now no ping responses or ssh login prompt.\n\nMy boss insisted someone to go out and take a look, as the client does international sales, and their day begins at 7am. So after an hour drive, and boss covered for my dinner (subway) which I ate on the way there, I'm on site and see the odd, PBX runs on linux by the way, error on screen, and I couldn't do anything to move it along. After another failed reboot, I booted it up in an environmental ubuntu, and checked the health of the drive.\n\n&gt; *Oh ya!* My boss had the wild idea last year to use a flash drive for quicker system upgrades and swap outs in the future. Three bad blocks (sections of data) on the 8GB drive.\n\nDiscussed the issue with my boss, we toss around ideas, and gave in with the idea of installing a new drive, which was not brought, and at least get the basics out of the way. This is now 7pm. Go to a nearby walmart and pick up a TEMP flash drive, and get the OS installed on it.\n\nAt this time, I am glad I keep two flash drives with me. One with general tools (bunch of diagnostic software), and a multiboot drive (many ISOs of OS installations and environmental OSes). No need to waste time downloading the OS installation off the net and finding another flash drive or disc.\n\nAfter visiting the nearby walmart, and swinging by a coworker's house, per boss's request to save time for tomorrow, to pick up some equipment unrelated. I return back to the client at 930pm. Flash drives in hand. Begin the installation, wasted half an hour troubleshooting the initial installation setup, and got the very basics going for them. \n\nAll they now have is incoming calls rings all phones, the construction garage ringer, and a cordless phone. Nothing fancy, no time controls, interaction menus, no voicemail to email. Finished by midnight, home by 1:20am. Roughly a 15 hour day.\n\nAt this time, we are working on a schedule to go back on site, install a real drive, HDD or SSD, install the OS, and configure as needed. Will have to be in the evening, again. Luckily, if I can copy over from the flash to the new drive (backup and restore), I can save time and get them going the same way, and finish and fine tune the day, to a week.",

But, now I've lost all my data, that shouldn't have happened. \n\n*super goes ahead and says the same thing I did* \n\nSuper: A factory reset erases all your data and reverts it to factory specs. You can go ahead and redownload the apps from the store. \n\nUser: Oh, okay. \n\n",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, apologies for any formatting woes, etc.  I think it has been long enough now to tell this silly little story without implicating the guilty.  \n  \nLet's roll back to early-middle-ish 2000s.  I worked as an operator slinging tapes and running batch programs at a fairly small data center in the middle of nowhere, or rather, across from a cow pasture. It centralized some IT functions for one to two dozen remote businesses.  It's a tiny two story building with just enough room for some raised floor and maybe ten offices for developers and engineers.  Said engineers are terribly protective of their ~~jobs~~ equipment, refuse any access that might lead to us learning anything above our station, and regard our station as monkeys with wrenches and tape drives.  Sadly, I haven't had a whole lot of better experiences with upper level engineers.  \n  \n$me - tape monkey that pays attention to detail  \n$coworkers - my fellow ops team and witnesses  \n$maint - electrical monkey  \n$eng - one of many superior beings that demand we never touch their stuff  \n  \n**The Setup** - on my last work day during a weekend shift, we start getting a couple of power alarms on the facility panel.  This place took their reliability seriously enough to get a UPS system, closet full of batteries, generator, the full kit.  The alarm indicates some electrical noise.  Nothing critical.  Alarm recorded to be passed on to $maint during the work week.  \n  \n**The Plot** - I come back in after a few days have passed.  Facility power still has an alarm on it, I follow up with management and get notified the UPS has a fault and vendor will be in today.  Work goes on, as usual.  $coworkers are running the usual morning backups.  Vendor shows up later in the morning, $maint in tow to supervise.  \n  \nFrom what I pieced together later, it went down like this.  The UPS was put into bypass and worked on.  The vendor found a faulty capacitor that was the cause of the dirty power alarms.  Capacitor replaced.  In theory, fine, right?  Well, I don't know how electrical is supposed to work, but they didn't test the replaced capacitor.  In fact, they just tested it... by throwing the switch and taking it off bypass, $maint nodding the whole way.  \n  \nIt worked.  For ten whole seconds.  Then the whole building went black.  Everything.  Every light, every server, every router, phones, workstations, the big db system, all dead.  \n  \n$coworkers jaws hit the floor.  I perform the facepalm required by cliche.  \n  \nThis isn't even the part that kills me.  \n  \n**The Punchline** - Our team takes a few minutes to get our shock and laughter out of the way.  We definitely choose not to wander over and pester $maint or vendor, figuring all the important people are about to descend in storm and fury soon enough, and we're safer over here with a quieter day ahead of us.  \n  \nSurprisingly slowly, one of the developers finally comes in to see what's going on, checks with us, gets our brief summary, then goes over to pester $maint.  $eng comes in shortly after and beelines over to me.  \n  \n$eng: What happened?  \n$me: Vendor was working on the UPS, I'm not sure of the specifics, but clearly something went wrong.  \n  \nAnd then, with all the assurance of someone who has clearly not taken enough stock of the situation...  \n  \n$eng: We need to send out an email.  \n  \nHe was three long steps from the completely dead email server, and surrounded by our clearly nonfunctional workstations, and *in the dark because the lights were out*.  \n  \nI don't recall if I gave him a beat to reconsider that, or if there was a grand spread of arms to take it in, because my mouth simply overrode my brain, and just spouted a flabbergasted...  \n  \n$me: \"On WHAT?!\"  \n$eng: *blink*, *blink*, *180 spin and hasty retreat back to office*  \n  \n$coworkers, like a good troop, waited for him to get through a door and then fell over laughing.  \n  \nThe $VP comes in two minutes later and outlines a plan for us to call out and notify all our remote customers of the failure as soon as the phone system, likely the quickest to recover and easiest to verify, can boot back up.  I get, in hindsight, that $eng really wanted some way to reach out... but, no, it still just breaks my brain.  \n  \nVendor managed to find a third part to swap in and data center was repowered maybe 15 minutes later.  Once we could, remote offices were contacted ASAP to let them know why all their apps were down and would continue to be down a bit while we got everything checked out.  I was not talked to for insubordination or pointing out the obvious, this time.  \n",

This alarm system would start screeching and doing it's thing even if people were home and it was disabled.\n\nThe technician attended, couldn't find anything wrong with the sensors or control unit, and went away. This happened again-and-again. The tech started replacing each component. Eventually, he'd replaced every sensor and control unit but the issue remained. The home-owner was not too happy, but was willing to stick with this system until it worked properly (clearly, customers were a lot more understanding 30 years ago).\n\nOver time, the tech noticed a pattern. This seemed to occur mostly on Friday and Saturday evenings.\n\nFinally, the technician decides to perform some RFI scans - just on the possibility a neighbor is using something that is causing the alarm to trigger. He stakes-out the house on a Friday night and runs his scans.\n\nHe discovers a take-away food shop about 400 metres down the road. The tech walks into the shop and his scanner is showing levels like you wouldn't believe.\n\nThis take-away shop has a microwave oven. The tech can see staff are putting things in and taking them out while the door to the microwave stays open. The oven ran continously.\n\nThe owner of the shop had disabled the door interlock on their microwave oven so they wouldn't have to keep opening and shutting the door, as this was slowing down food preparation.\n\nTo finish up: all staff have to be checked for cancers. :(\n",

        "text": "This story is quite lengthy and is mainly networking focussed. Anybody who has read my previous TFTS posts knows although I work 2nd line support I also did Dev work, as well as this, being the only hardware tech in the office and our infrastructure being based 300 miles away meant I was also the most qualified to set up PC's and manage the local network.\n\nWe operate in a managed office, so we share a building with other businesses, although we run our own network. We have our own network here which is connected to our HQ in London, however the building handles our phone lines. All our PCs and desks run to the local comms room, where they are patched into 2 x 28 port switches.\n\nOur phonelines require 1 direct connection to the switch, while the PCs can daisy chain or hook into a smaller switch which we keep under the desks. We have some local kit like fileserver, dns and firewall but we ultimately tunnel our connection, while the rest of the building operates on a different setup altogether, most importantly however, we all operate on the same physical lines.\n\nI know a few of you are already starting to itch at how bad this all sounds, trust me I've tried to get our infra to improve this - however since I am *not part of the team* my advice is often ignored.\n\nThis story is probably a strong example of *why* they thought this, having rewrote the tale from my youth I realise I took a lot of unnecessary risks, came to a lot of incorrect conclusions, and while ultimately the blame didn't rest with me; I made a lot of actions which made things both better and worse.\n\nI guess the main point of my tale is that everybody who did know better than me was eager to place the blame at my feet and tell me they weren't getting involved - even when that was exactly their job, but I digress. Here is the tale of the time I broke the buildings network.\n\n**Friday**\n\nSo one fine Friday afternoon we are setting up for some new employees starting on Monday. Our new desks arrive and the entire office joins forces to shut down, shift the new desks and set up the new computers. I have some tasks to set up some new hubs under the desks and hook in the new phone-lines, I take the opportunity to catalogue which floor ports are in use so that I can try and clear some space on the switch, with over 30 employees requiring phones and desktops, as well as printers and other devices we were starting to run short on space.\n\nAfter each desk is moved I mark each floor port in use, whether it's a phone or a desktop, then in the sever room I change the cable to the switch, blue for phone and grey for data. Afterwards I marvel at the cleanliness of it, each connection is clearly catalogued so we can trace from PC to floor port to switch port - and vice versa. Everybody is online, everybody logs into their phones, the office is ready for new staff - everybody pats themselves on the back and heads home for the weekend.\n\n**Monday**\n\nI come into work to more or less complete chaos. Nobody has access to the internet, those who do have access to the internet can't access our servers. I log into my PC and do some diagnosis. My machine connects to the internet and I ping our servers with no response. I try to ping the server by direct IP and this works for some reason. I check my IP and notice I'm not on our network, but one belonging to the building.\n\nI go to a few of those who can't connect to the internet and check their DNS settings, the DNS is unreachable and I try changing it over to a google DNS - which works. Okay so maybe our DNS is down - I go to see the building manager and ask if there were any power issues over the weekend. He tells me that there was a powercut in the area on Sunday night, but that we were supposedly unaffected.\n\nWith my limited knowledge of networking I start to form a theory in my head - there was a small powercut or a surge, our DHCP has gone offline and come back up but has been reset - so it's not allocating IP's - some of us are therefore finding a route to the next DHCP it can find, which is the buildings.\n\nI go back to my desk and try to access our DHCP server, I'm asked for a password and decide to try some basics like \"changeme\" or \"admin\". Remarkably one of those work and I'm met with the client listing. I can see a number of devices from our office, the ones which can connect - the IP range, subnet and gateway are all wrong - I call up our Infra team and let them know our findings, as well as make sure I'm on the right thinking. They agree that resetting the DHCP back to it's settings is probably good, agreeing that a power surge or power cut probably reset it.\n\nI set the DHCP settings - connection comes back for everybody in the office, servers visible. Everybody pats me on the back and we all get back to work.\n\n**Tuesday**\n\nI arrive at the office and am greeted by the Building Manager at his desk on the phone, as I walk through the door and smile at him I hear him say \"2 moments he's just walked through the door\". **Well that can't be good.** He tells me that nobody in the building can see their servers and are having intermittent connections, and that when he rang up our office to tell us about the outage they had told him that not only was their network fine; it was thanks to me messing around with the network yesterday.\n\nHe calls me over to his desk and asks me to speak to the buildings network engineers, who are a remote company and reluctant to send out an engineer to come take a look. I explain the situation; that our offices connection went down and we believe it was due to a power cut. The remote engineer agrees that I may be on the right lines, but changing settings on our own equipment shouldn't impact the rest of the building; although they might have had similar issues with power and he would check the rest of the equipment remotely to ensure it was configured.\n\nI go to our office and everybody is sat working happily - our network is running smoothly. I let everybody know whats going on in the building, then get on with my job.\n\nAt around lunch the Building Manager comes to the office and asks me to look at his PC. We go down and he's trying to remote to a server, the server is unreachable. I run a quick ipconfig and notice something awful. **He has one of our IPs.**\n\nThen it clicks into place. I hadn't modified our DHCP to have the correct settings; I had changed the entire building's DHCP server to force everybody onto our network. I imagine my face probably turned a lovely shade of green. I quickly (and I meant really f\\*\\*king quickly) reverted the settings on the DHCP server I was on yesterday. People in the rest of the building started to reconnect to their services, which some of our offices machines started disconnecting at random. \n\nThis was bizarre. We weren't automatically being put onto our network and were in fact connecting directly to the buildings wider network. But our network was still there, and we could ping our servers but only when we forced our clients to use our direct IP details, furthermore the rest of the building could suddenly do the same, and we were on the verge (probably far over the verge) of a data breach.\n\nThankfully there was a team of engineers on site who ran their own networking business (but didn't do networking for the buildings). $BM asked if they'd take a look and they'd asked me to come along. After a lengthy wander around the whole building, they asked me if we'd recently changed our floor ports. I told them about the work I'd done on cleaning up on unused space. They told me the building uses a spanning tree protocol and that there can't be any loops in the network.\n\nI was tasked with once again ripping up our floor ports, remapping the whole lot and ensuring that nothing plugged in was plugged in anywhere else. I went through all of our floor ports, all of our switch ports, til I was happy there were no loops - it was 9pm and I checked my desktop. The network was offline completely. There was nothing more I could do that day, I was exhausted and figured I'd go to sleep early, be in before everybody else the next day and figure it out.\n\n**Wednesday (Final Day of outage)**\n\nI come in at 7am (that was early for me) as we established the day before, the building's network was fine, ours was not. I try a few solutions I thought of over the last few hours but to no avail. My colleagues started to filter in at 8:30, some being understanding of the outage and others asking me when I'd fix it. Tired of pointing out I didn't actually cause the outage I just started trying to get in touch with anybody who knew more about the network than I did. Our Infrastructure denied all knowledge of anything being wrong, as one point asserting they never even set up the physical network and only handled configuration. Our Building Manager put me in touch with the remote network engineers who were singing the same tune, that we set up the physical network and they just handled configuration. Completely lost for solutions I started trying to set up contingency, we had some small WiFi hotspots, since they couldn't hold more than a few clients, I decided we would connect 1 PC to the hotspot, and bridge the rest of the connection through the hubs. It wasn't pretty but it'd get us online and we could use our VPN as if we were \"working from home\".\n\nI disconnected each hub from the floor ports as I didn't want the building network to interfere and set up the first bank of desks. The plan worked, everybody connected to the internet and started to connect to the VPN. I got to the second bank of desks and disconnected the hub from the floor port. No sooner had that been done than people started to shout about the networking being back. In my head I started to curse. That wasn't a coincidence. I asked somebody to connect to a random website to ensure it wasn't cached data. Not just people on this bank, the entire office was back online.\n\nI plugged the cable I had just unplugged back in. The network fell once more. I remembered the local Network guy from yesterday saying to me \"Make sure there are no loops\". I checked the floor port, 3 phone lines and 1 data connection, the data connection went to the hub, and 7 more cables came out. Wait? 7? There are 6 computers and 1 connection to the switch, so why are there 8 cables plugged in? I asked each person to tell me when windows said their network cable was unplugged, each one called out until 1 cable did nothing. I followed it, it went around the entire bank of desks, back around a desk leg, into *another* *separate floor port*. What's more is that the floor port it was plugged into mapped to the other switch in our cabinet. Making a perfect little loop in our Spanning Tree.\n\nThe fault wasn't with anybody really. When everybody pitched in moving the desks on Friday somebody had spotted a spare data cable and thought they were being helpful plugging it back into the floor.\n\nSo there you have it, a 3 day outage brought to and end, by unplugging a single 5m cat 5e cable. A cable that managed to bring down an entire buildings network. I reported my findings to everybody concerned, our local infra blamed the buildings topology. The building engineers blamed our local infra, the engineers who helped out were happy it was resolved and everybody in our office continued to blame me for touching it in the first place.\n\nI was quite happy to put on some music, and start dealing with some regular user issues.\n\nMuch needed TL;DR: entire buildings network goes down because we accidentally plugged 2 switches into eachother",

No problem. Happens all the time. So i go through the troubleshooting tree (think google but with drop down menus for options). Made sure everything was set up right with her account. Even clicked the magical button that was supposed to fix everything(they never told me what it actually does. just that they had to turn off their phone for it). It was looking like i'd have to transfer to T2. I didn't want to transfer to T2 bc they where known to be jerks and being pretty new they would usually try to rake me over the coals for the littlest things.

        "text": "Hi my fellow TFTS'ers,\n\nThis is my story of the time I saved almost 10 years of a family’s life. I know there are plenty of hero data recovery stories already but this one is all mine and I’m proud of it.\n\nFor some backstory, I currently work as a “Jack of all trades, Master of none” tech at a small local IT/Telco Business. We do anything and everything IT/Telco related, from pc servicing and building to Internet plans install and setup. We service many local businesses and residential clients. We are always getting new things to do and learning all the time. I love it and as a 26yr old I’m learning new stuff every day!\n\nA regular of ours came into the shop asking for one of our senior guys. She was in tears and we all came out to see what was wrong. It turns out that their families external HDD was dropped and was completely dead. Like dead-dead. It dawned on us what was coming. She explained that they had lost over 12+ years of family photos and videos… Jesus… 12+ years of baby photos all the way to tweenagers for their 2 kids, grandparents who were no longer with us, beloved family pets no longer with us… it was pretty awful. \n\nWe didn’t have the kit in store to attempt a recovery like that. So, we had it shipped off to a trusted dedicated recovery company to give it a shot. Unfortunately, that drive was donezo. We broken the news to the couple and they we understandably distraught. As I had taken over dealing with them I suggested a few things.   \n\n\n$ME: Do you have any other external drives or USBs lying around that you may have saved stuff to.\n\n$Customer: \\*Sobs\\* No nothing  \n (The poster children for the importance of regular backups right here)\n\n$ME: What about CDs/DVDs?\n\n$Customer: No\n\n$ME: “aww jeeeez rick”… Hmmm how about old laptops or PCs? We built you a new machine last year, didn’t we?\n\n$Customer: Oh yeah, we have 2 old laptops in the shed but they’re dead too.\n\n$ME: Sweet, it’s a long shot but bring them in and I’ll have a look.  \n\n\nThe customer brought in the laptops the same day and I spent the afternoon taking them apart and retrieving the 2.5” drives.\n\nBOOM! Sure enough, the 2nd laptop had a working drive (barely. It was making some odd noises). I wasted no time cloning the drive to a new drive and started sifting through all the data… It’s all there… well most of it. Scattered in random folders in Documents/Pictures/Desktop and a storage partition. The pictures went back to about 2008 and the latest we had was 2017. I organized it all onto 1 folder and backed it up in their client file on our server. We made the call as a group announcing the good news. It was the best feeling. They purchased 2 new external drives from us and we loaded on all their organized data free of charge. (only charged for the drives).\n\nAfter all that they got back about 60&amp;#37;-70&amp;#37; of the total lost data, but all the important sentimental stuff was there, and they couldn’t be happier.\n\nI have more stories from my relatively short time in professional IT and Telco that I’ll get around to posting as well 😊.",

        "text": "Long time lurker, not quite first time poster (I have like two or three stories here, but they're very old). This is a short one that goes back around a year or two and of which I was reminded of by a friend's misadventure. It is not technically tech support, although I ended up solving a weird problem that affected quite a few users, none the least myself.\n\nI'm a CompSci student, hoping to someday become a sysadmin or DevOps dude. I'm also in dire need of a job, since literally everything available in my region is outside of my skillset (I'm not good at front-end development). Basically, my whole building knows that if a computer needs to be fixed, my door is one to be knocked on, mostly because I don't leave that often.\n\nOne day, I am interrupted from ~~browsing Reddit~~ important schoolwork by a new tenant from one of the apartments. She says she no longer has any cell signal, and came to me because I'm known to be \"good with computers\". I politely explain that I have neither experience nor access to the nearest cell tower, and to wait a few days to see if the situation improves.\n\nA few hours later, a different person knocks on my door. This one I know, though, but he has the same issue, no cell reception. I give him the same answer and send him on his way.\n\nHalf an hour later, another tenant. Then another one. Then someone from the building across the street from mine. All receive the same answer from me. At this point, I (FINALLY) check my phone; no signal either. I figure that it can't be tower related, as we have coverage from at least two towers (at the time, I think there are four nowadays), but, unable to do anything about it, decide to call my phone service provider the next day from school.\n\nLater that day/evening, the power to the entire building is cut. A quick glance out the window reveals that it's not a blackout, every building in the street has power except mine. I go down to the basement to check on the panel, and find... nothing. The breaker flipped for apparently no reason. I flip it back on, and go back to ~~attempting to make sense of some C#~~ watching Twitch. Not ten minutes later, the power goes out again.\n\nI make my way downstairs, but again, nothing strange about the breaker. Except that it was off of course. I turn it on, then decide to stay for a bit, see what happens.\n\nFive minutes later, one of my neighbors (different than all the previous ones) shows up, intent on turning the breaker off. What follows is a bit fuzzy in my head (you will understand why in a minute), but basically, he explained to me that he needed to turn off the electricity to prevent the government from spying on him through the magnets they hid in his walls. Or in other words: my neighbor went insane.\n\nI just nodded along, feigning understanding his ranting, and let him cut the power. I then went out for a smoke, far enough as to get cell signal to call the cops. An hour later, they show up, and promptly escort him to an ambulance. Then one of the cops comes to speak to me.\n\n&gt;$cop: By the way, have any of you had cell reception trouble lately ?  \n&gt;$me: Actually yeah ! Why do you ask ?\n&gt;\n&gt;*$cop produces a large-ish homebrew device. Based on the context, I guess it was a signal jammer of some sort.*\n&gt;\n&gt;$cop: We found this inside his apartment.  \n&gt;$me: The hell ? What is this guy doing with a signal jammer ?  \n&gt;$cop: Says he needed it to \"cleanse the air\" or whatever. Might not be the only one around.  \n\nIt wasn't. The insane neighbor made at least two of them, one of which he somehow hooked up to the closer of the (then-)two cell towers, and it definitely looks like he was going for the second. I'm not sure of what happened to him after that...\n\n**tl;dr:** Insane neighbor thinks the governement is spying on him with wall magnets (?!). Decides the most logical course of action is to jam cell signal and cut power to the entire building. Gets thrown in the slammer by proxy of pissed CompSci student in need of Twitch.",

        "text": "Hello TFTS,\n\nA little story that happened today, you will see that the issue is quite simple in itself, but the real problem is coming here from a specific user, who I've already talked about in other stories (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8k5kmy/when_two_wires_are_too_much_to_handle/))\n\nIt was near 04:00 PM now and I was ready to take my fifteen minutes break of the afternoon, since we work in a \"IT Kiosk\" system (though we are in an open space... I know, it makes sense), one of us must always be here on site or take a company cellphone we have here and put a forward from the phone line of the IT support to the cellphone.\n\nSo taking the cellphone and heading to the cafeteria, I'd just pressed the button for the coffee on the machine when the cellphone started to ring.\n\n&gt; $Me: Hello, IT Support, $Me speaking.\n\n&gt;$User: Yes hello, there is an emergency ! My laptop's screen is dead, it's entirely black. When I plug the laptop on the docking station, it displays properly on the monitor, on the desk, but on the laptop itself there is nothing !\n\n&gt; $Me: Alright, have you tried to shutdown your laptop by pressing the power button for about a minute, before pressing it again once to turn it on ?\n\n&gt; $User: Yes, I've tried that many times already but the screen remains black !\n\n&gt; $Me: Alright then, you'll have to come by at the IT kiosk with your laptop so we can have a check.\n\n&gt; $User: Can I come now ?\n\n&gt; $Me: Sure, you can.\n\nSo, heading back to our \"kiosk\", $User finally appears fifteen minutes later with the laptop. I can see that the laptop is powered on, but there is indeed no display on the screen.\n\n&gt; $User: So, yeah, I tried to reboot it many times with the button, and it has been doing this for some time and-...\n\n&gt; $Me: *(pressing the power button for about fifteen seconds, the laptop turns off. Pressing it once again, the laptop turns on, the DELL logo is now visible on the screen and Windows load normally)*.\n\n&gt; $User: Oh. Well I tried exactly that and it didn't work ! Thanks anyway !\n\nIf users can't even reboot their laptops now, may Roy and Moss help us.\n\nTL;DR =&gt; User calls in about her laptop, saying her screen is broken and that it remains entirely black all the time. She claims she already rebooted it many times, and after she came to our IT kiosk, I fixed the issue by a simple reboot of the laptop.",

        "text": "My environment is a mix-mash of aging crap that was set up wrong 10 years ago, aging crap that was set up wrong 5 years ago, and new crap that I set up (mostly) correctly. The REALLY old stuff has no concept of centralized account/password management. The old stuff is linked to AD for non-prod, but not for prod because my predecessors had NO idea how any of it works, and thought that they had to put servers in a different domain to get them to authenticate against AD in that domain. As a result, all of the really old stuff, as well as the old prod servers have individual accounts and passwords on them. If you login to one of those and change your password, it ONLY gets changed for THAT system.  \n\nI built out a new dev, test, and QA environment for one of the dev teams. Due to a typo in the server template, /tmp got the wrong permissions. Now, when you login with AD, the kerberos portion creates a credentials cache file for you in /tmp where it keeps your ticket. With the bad permissions on /tmp, nobody but the superuser could create that file...so nobody but me could login. It took me less than 15 minutes to find and identify the problem, and 15 seconds to fix it.  \n\nOPS opens a ticket stating that he can't login. My first thought is, \"Did I miss one of the servers?\" I check, and no, /tmp looks ok. I start checking logs...sometimes sssd will try and talk to the wrong AD server, but that's been mostly fixed, too. The logs report that the password is wrong. I tell him that he probably fat-fingered his password.  \n\n\\*\"What password should I type?\"\\*  \n\nDude. Contrary to what the TV shows would have you believe, the SysAdmin has NO idea what your password is.  \n\n\"Uhhh...your AD password.\"  \n\n\\*\"Which AD password?\"\\*  \n\nNow, to be fair, this is a valid question. My domain is separate from the corporate domain. But we've NEVER used corporate domain accounts to login. OPS knows this, though. Right? I ask when the last time he logged in to a domain-connected system was...he doesn't know what I mean. I figure I'll save some time and just reset his domain password. He's now able to login, is forced to change his password, and all is good.  \n\n...for about an hour.  \n\n\\*\"I can't login to $OLD\\_PROD\\_SERVER\"\\*  \n\n\"What's your local password on that system?\"  \n\n\\*\"Same password I just set.\"\\*  \n\n\"Well, there's your problem. This server is local authentication only. It doesn't talk to Active Directory. You need to type in your local password.\"  \n\n\\*\"What's my local password?\"\\*  \n\nDude, are you freaking serious?  \n\n\"I don't know your password. When was the last time you logged in to this server?\"  \n\n\\*\"Yesterday. My password expired and I had to change it.\"\\*  \n\nAnd like that, the lightbulb goes off. He changed his password on a standalone system, then tried to login with AD to a new server with the new password...that AD knows nothing about. \"Use the password you set this one to yesterday.\"  \n\n\\*\"I don't remember.\"\\*  \n\nI reset his password and add this server to the list of systems that need to be scrapped and redeployed with AD integration set up properly.",

        "text": "Many years ago, I was an Air Force avionics technician. I had some very interesting experiences while in uniform, some of them I can even share with all of you. This story is of the day that was the beginning of the end of my Air Force career. \n\n[As mentioned in this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8ozx2m/tales_from_aircraft_maintenance_sort_of_tank_you/), I was injured on the job which resulted in my permanent transition into civilian life and a much better life (it took a while to get here too) as an IT guy.\n\nIt was an oppressively hot day (triple digits hot) on the flight line of $deployedlocation, otherwise known as a normal day at $deployedlocation. I had returned to working on jets just days before and was longing for my semi-comfortable previous job running comms at our command post. The days were shorter and didn’t require me to bake in the direct sun or worse in the large and even hotter aluminum cylinders known as C-17’s. I was “lucky” this day, I was working night shift. I am always happier at night. It’s not so bright out, nor does everything metal require thick leather gloves to be touched.\n\nShift begins and I grab my tool kit and other equipment and head out to the ramp for the first of three landers I will be working that night. I perform all my checks on the generator and AC unit for the jet and do my FOD walk. Once the prep is done, I sit on the Hobart and definitely did not take a nap for about 30 minutes while waiting for my jet.\n\nMy radio goes off, announcing “my jet” is on approach as is another jet that is declaring some kind of issue, effectively this call amounts to one step shy of an inflight emergency (IFE). With this call, the fire department and medical are soon standing by just in case. The pilot was vague in his call out.\n\nFast forward about 15 minutes, my jet is on the ground, parked in its spot and ready to be serviced. I get to work. The first task is to make sure nothing fell off in flight or looks like it will next time it flies. As I am performing my task, I notice the “follow me” car leading the IFE jet into a spot next to mine. I also notice that there is a generator sitting there right about where the inboard engine (#3) would hit it. The driver of the follow me does not see me waving like a crazy person or the generators. \n\nBad things are about to happen.\n\nI turn on my marshalling wands and signal the pilot to spot, the jet continues to taxi towards the Hobart. About 100 yards to go. After I realize that the jet isn’t going to stop, I run as fast as I could to move the power cart. Of course this is one of the Hobarts with stuck brakes (about half were stuck). I put my back into it (literally) and push this thing out of the way.\n\nCompletely out of breath from pushing the cart, I collapse on the ground in time to watch the nonresponsive jet taxi past. Moments later, my adrenaline wears off and I feel immense pain in my abdomen. I proceed to collapse on the ground and curl into a ball hoping for a quick death, just to make this pain stop.\n\nI was found a few hours later next to that power cart when shift change occurred. After my coworkers were done giving me sh- a hard time for laying around all shift, I am loaded on to that very same jet that had just taxi’d in. It was a medevac mission on its way back to the states and I was on it.\n\nWithin 8 weeks, I had my hernia surgery and was back to work. Day 3 back at work, I push another power cart and get another hernia in the same spot, nearly the exact same way. I found out later that the doc who did my first surgery was lazy and went in the easy way. Surgery two, the doc did it right, but it was too late. Permanent nerve damage. I haven’t worked on a jet since that day.\n\nNote: This is not the last of the Tales From Aircraft Maintenance story. I had eluded to this event in my last story and got a few requests for this in comments and DM.",

I'm able to quickly pull up his account based on his phone number.\n\"OK, I have the number for $electriccompany here, are you ready to write it down or would you like me to transfer you to them?\"\n\nCustomer: \"Whut? Youenz needs to come fix it, youenz ran them whaaarrs\" (wires)\n\nMe: Rather amused at this point \"We ran the fiber optics to your house, but not the electricity. $Electricconpany would need to fix them. Would you like me to transfer you to $electriccompany?\"\n\nCustomer: now quite upset, starts yelling at me to come fix his electricity because \"We ran the wharrs\" \n\nMe: I begrudgingly start to open a ticket, whereas before I didn't even feel the need to log the call as it seemed like a wrong number. As I pull up more account information, I see that several set top boxes are up and functioning normally.\n\"Uh, it looks like your TV service is working, and I also see your data services are up and running too-- did your power come back on?\"\n\nCustomer: \"No damnit, the power is only out in ma garage! Where youenz ran the wharrs!\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, you mean the battery backup for your fiber services? Yes that's installed in your garage. But it seems to be working, I'm seeing a normal battery status from here, so the power must only be out for some of you outlets.\"\n.....\n\nThis leads to me teaching a grown man about GFCI outlets, even though this has nothing to do with our service, all the while with him ranting about how our wharrz messed up his power.\n\nEdit: \nBy request, adding the resolution. I just asked questions regarding the outlets in his garage to see if any were GFCI. We found one with the button out, so I told him what that means-- that something shorted or faulted an electrical circuit, and all the outlets on that circuit would stop working. He found a crappy extension cord running through a part of his garage with a puddle. I recommended he unplug it before resetting the GFCI. He did so, then reset it. Power was restored to his garage, including to his garage door. He was actually very thankful and apologetic-- I don't remember the exact words but something to the effect of realizing it \"wasn't youenz whars after all.\" Happy customer with problem (albeit not our problem) fixed.\n",

I'll give him your phone number!\n\n&gt; Super!\n\nJeff is a happy old man, and his personality is like the perfect granddad. He starts shooting me pictures of some software I have never seen before and start talking about a server he can't connect to. This leads me no where, so I ask him if we could do some remote support. He responds back that it will not be possible but he will be over the next day if that is okay. I tell him it is.\n\nThe next day there is a knock on the door:\n\n&gt; Me: Hi Jeff!\n\n&gt; Jeff: Hi, thanks for helping me. Here is the machine.\n\nJeff hands me this very old laptop. Looks at least 15 years old and I look at it and see a sticker that has been torn off where i can make out \"avy\". \n\n&gt; Me: What operating system is this running?\n\n&gt; Jeff: Windows 2000 NT (this story takes place in 2018).\n\n&gt; Me (kinda excited): Wow! Really? Well lets see if we can make it work. What is the software you are trying to install?\n\nJeff: &lt;REDACTED NAME&gt;\n\n&gt; Me: Never heard of it.\n\nWe get the computer started with no issues\n\n&gt; Me: Is it this shortcut?\n\n&gt; Jeff: Yes\n\nI click on the shortcut where there is a radar on it. And I get an error message. I quickly figure out that the installation is wrong and I go through the process of reinstalling it. I will skip this part because it just trouble shooting and following 2 guides that are both right and wrong, but I get through it and gets the server started.\n\n&gt; Me: There we go the server is started.\n\n&gt; Jeff: Super, try the client.\n\nI start the client and it pops up fine and suddenly I have a screen of my nations outline that looks like a RADAR picture and all surrounding contries. I look up on the task bar and see plane, boats, tanks, and nuke icons plus alot of other military looking things.\n\n&gt; Me: Err... Jeff... What is this!?\n\n&gt; Jeff: Ohh yeah, is it a program our army used to decifer radar signals and play out war scenarios. It has been decommisioned 10 years ago. I am going to use it for roleplaying games.\n\nSo what I have not said yet was that Jeff is a veteran and a highly ranking one at that. He somehow convinced the army/navy of my country to hand him a decommisioned tool that was used by our army for real and is now trying to use it for role playing games in a real world war 2 bunker where collages kids is going to see a scenario play out on a former real life war program, controlled by him.\n\n&gt; Me: WOW! That is cool.\n\n&gt; Jeff: That is not the best part. If I got it working, the army will provide me with a live feed from all radars of the country to get real life data.\n\n&gt; Me: WHAT!?\n\n&gt; Jeff: Cool right. Btw, can you install it on this old desktop to?\n\nTLDR: I did family support for a family freind, expecting it to be just normal computer error. Instead I got to play with software used by the army/navy 10 years ago on an old windows NT machine that is going to be used in a roleplaying game in a real bunker 2 months from now, with live radar feed from my country!\n\nCurrently Jeff is sampling the system. If it goes okay I may have an update on how the role playing went in about 2-3 months as I might need to help them set it up.\n\n*UPDATE*: I remembered wrong. Jeff did not get live feed. Jeff would get a CD with data taken from live feed where there was an ongoing drill happening with mock enemies and such, which dates back some years. So sorry for that confusion. I also talked to Jeff about releasing it online. He was not overly fond of the idea, even though the program has been declassified, so I will follow his feelings and not release it. I am sorry. I will however take some screenshots so you guys can see what the program looks like. I will posts these later today. \n\n*UPDATE 2*: Here is a screenshot of the program. I have covered up anything that would give away to many details. The maps is zoomed in to a local area. I added some object to it as good as I could. I have very basic knowledge from Jeff. I hope this is a good replacement instead of the actual program:\n\n[KRONOS](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uncf3emr21lbttp/KRONOS.PNG?dl=0)\n\n[KRONOS2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m0plqtz5u9jdowk/KRONOS2.PNG?dl=0)\n\nEdit: Fixed typos and wow, Thanks for the gold!\n\nEdit 2: A lot have asked for the program. I have it running on a virtual box at the moment, so this is possible. However, I will only do it if I get permission from Jeff. I will ask him.",

A good guy who knows his stuff. \n\n**$firm**: Independent IT consulting firm I worked for.\n\n**$exVendor**: Our (then) hosted Exchange vendor. They who control the servers control the emails.\n\n**$largeClient**: One of the firms larger, Windows-using, clients. About 50 users.\n\nI had just graduated from college and got hired at a small consulting firm. I was mainly hired due to my knowledge of Macs, as $firm had just taken on clients that used them. However, most of their clients used Windows which I had very little experience with and thus $firm was going to train me on. (This will be important later).\n\nThe first two days on the job (a Thursday and Friday) were taken up touring the various client's facilities and getting a look at their infrastructure, etc. Early Monday morning rolls around and I'm pretty excited. My first full day as a support tech! And then my phone rang....\n\n&gt;**$boss**: $hyacinth, I need you to get down to $largeClient right now.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$hyacinth**: Um, okay. What's going on?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$boss**: $exVendor had a server failure last night and they haven't been able to restore from a backup yet. No one at $largeClient can access their email. Actually, most of our clients don't have email. We need all hands on deck. I'm on my way to help $otherClient. Call me when you get to $largeClient and I'll walk you through what you need to do.\n\nSo I hauled ass to $largeClient. I nervously walked in the door, introduced myself to the folks I hadn't met on Friday, and did my best to pretend like I knew what I was doing. Luckily they were cool people and were anxious but not panicking. Some of our other clients weren't as understanding. Anyway, I called $boss and he walked me through what to do, which involved going through a series of Outlook hoops. This was maybe the third time I'd ever used Outlook, so I had very little idea what the hell I was doing. But I muddled through with only a few terrified phone calls to $boss and more than a few stupid questions.  \n\nAbout 3/4 of $firm's clients who used hosted Exchange happened to have their datastores on the $exVendor server that died. So we all spent the next two days dealing with our frustrated, panicky clients and trying to get everyone's mail back. But, you ask, why didn't $exVendor just restore the server from a backup? Ah, gentle reader, how I wish that had been possible. You see, as it turns out, $exVendor didn't have a viable, recent backup of the server that croaked. And in fact hadn't had a viable backup of that server for SIX MONTHS. Which we only found out when $boss kept pestering them and one of the $exVendor's support techs let that little tidbit slip out. Needless to say $firm switched our clients to a new hosted Exchange provider not long after.\n\nAll in all we managed to get most of the mail back. Only a few users ended up with missing emails, mostly due to using webmail so the message wasn't cached. It was a hell of a way to start a new job, though.\n\nTL;DR: My third day as a support tech was spent recovering about 50 user's emails due to our Exchange vendor losing a server and not having a backup of it.",

        "text": "Hello all, obligatory long time lurker first time posted, also on mobile so forgive formatting.\n\n\n**Brief background**\nI work for a small IT company providing 1st and 2nd line support for a range of companies/small businesses in our area. It's a great place to learn and there are some really good people to work with, also the end users are generally really nice and accept we know what we are on about...mostly.\n\n\nThis story takes place earlier this year and does not have a happy ending.\n\n\n**Cast**\n\n\nMe : Young enthusiastic tech support guy\n\nBO : Business owner who logged the call\n\n\n&gt;Me : Hello this is Me from company how can I help you today\n\n&gt;BO : Hello Me, this is BO from other company, we are having issues getting into users account, it looks like they have the wrong password\n\n&gt;Me : Ok so just to be clear the user has forgotten their password and need assistance resetting it?\nNot entirely uncommon as I'm sure most of you are aware\n\n&gt; BO : No users password is wrong, it's not what it should be. You see we all have the same password in case someone is away or sick so we can just login to their account to get any work we need.\n\n&gt; Me : .....\n\n&gt; Me : .....\n\n&gt; BO : Hello?\n\n&gt; Me : Sorry, yes I am still here. I'm just not sure I fully grasp what you are telling me.\n\n&gt; Me : You all have the same password and regularly login as other people to access data they don't save on the company drive?\n\n&gt; BO : Yes, we all use *businessname1* but user has changed it and is off so we can't get into their account.\n\n\nNow this is the point where my brain has completed its reboot cycle and is catching up. Not only do they all have the same password, it's literally in the top 10 of password not to use.\n\n\n&gt; BO : So can you please set the users password back to *businessname1* so we can access their account as they have critical documents saved locally.\n\n\nNow i've dealt with BO before and of he says it's urgent it is, I still had to try though.\n\n\n&gt; Me : Ok BO, firstly I do not recommend we do that. Having every user with the same password is not only a bad idea it's down right catastrophic and will (already had as it turns out) lead to problems if anyone outside the organisation guesses that password. I can reset it to something you know so you can access the document the you need for now, the user can then reset it upon their return.\n\n&gt; BO : No the standard password will be fine.\n\n\n*Cue 20 minutes of back and forth for why this is a bad idea, including me getting my manager involved*\n\n\nNow I'd like to say the logic and passion of my argument won over BO and a new era of security swept through other company, unfortunately this is real life.\n\n\n&gt; BO : Ok I understand what you are saying, but ultimately it's our system and this is our policy. I'll send an email saying I forced you to do it but just do it as I have asked.\n\n\nAs mentioned my manager was involved, he said Customer has ultimate say and will have to pay if their system is hacked/encrypted if they insist on that password, so I did what I had to do to keep feeding my family.\n\n\n&gt; Me : Very well I have set the password as requested (literally never felt so unclean), is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n&gt; BO : No that's all thanks, and don't worry everything will be fine *click*\n\n\nAfter the call I found out from a colleague this company was hacked last year, their response was to change their password to 'businessname1', it used to be 'businessname'. I still shudder when we get a new user request from them.\n\n\nThat's my tale of woe, let me know what you guys think, I have other more rewarding stories that have a happy ending if you want to hear them.\n\nEdit : correcting auto correct.\nEdit 2 : Yes we do have call recording and this call was recorded and specifically downloaded and saved because as has been mentioned we do need confirmation in case of any future *incidents*.\nThis particular company is looking to get cyber security certification so they can put on their website they are secure, top of our list for discussion is **you all have the same password, this needs to change**. We will see how that goes in a few weeks when the ball starts rolling.",

        "text": "Not IT, but I know about 5% of what a seasoned tech does which seemingly puts my knowledge above 85% of the population.\n\nA couple months ago, my company started rolling out new computers for everybody. I was fortunate enough to snag a brand new laptop and docking station (on ancient desktop previously). This required a bit of desk reorganization so I could dual-screen with my external monitor. The problem occurred the first time I had to unlock the system after it went idle. The external monitor would receive the signal to wake and display my desktop for about 3 seconds, then go black for 3, and continue this cycle until I pulled the cable for the dock for about 15 seconds before plugging it in again. Laptop display would be behaving normally during this time.\n\nOnce I was back to working the problem would not return until the system would automatically lock for inactivity. It would only be a mild annoyance if the timeout wasn't so short. In the time it took to go to the restroom or get some coffee I would return to a locked system and the pulsing monitor. Add to that multiple meetings per day I could have this issue up to 10 times in a shift. \n\nNot wanting to bug IT with something that I may be able to fix on my own, I began Googling. There were a few support articles regarding updating display drivers and BIOS--things I am prevented from doing without admin rights. Damn. Time to get IT involved. So, I call my boy, Red, and he explains that all drivers and BIOS are up to date and at versions equal to the articles that were to fix the issue. He says we'd probably just have to replace the laptop as nobody else was having this issue. I asked him to hold off on that while I try to dig more to prevent replacing a $1,500 laptop unnecessarily. Defeated, I sat down for lunch and pulled up /r/talesfromtechsupport to pass the time.\n\nReading along, I get to a post (which you'll recognize in a moment) where a problem that had been stumping the tech for weeks actually had a very simple solution. I shook my head thinking there is no way my bluetooth speaker could be the culprit. I mean, the laptop itself has a magnet on that side to hold the stylus! And the speaker is far enough away that it can't be the cause, right? But for the sake of science, I moved the little box 10 inches further away from the laptop.\n\nWell, here I am, over a week later, and I have not had the problem again. Earlier this week I saw Red walking through the office and I knew I had to tell him. \"In over 30 years of doing this job, I've even thought of a fix like that!\" Turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks.",

        "text": "Long time reader but first time poster, I finally have a story good enough to share. This all happened yesterday.\n\nBit of a background, I work in IT for a company that supports various restaurants with their POS systems and other IT related stuff. All of these are owned by the same $Owner who loves to make last minute demands leaving us to figure out how to make it work. Most of the time it's repairing kitchen printers, but today's tale was something different.\n\n**$Me**: Lowly IT guy\n\n**$Manager**: Manager of the branch. Actually a cool guy who has decent basic IT skills and can troubleshoot the basic stuff himself. Very easy to work with.\n\nIt all starts with me relaxing in the office, having gotten most of the major jobs out of the way, so was hoping to take it easy. That is until I got the phone call from $Manager...\n\n&gt;$Manager: Help! $Owner just called and wants to use the VIP room to watch today's match!\n\nI looked at the date and realised our country was playing this evening for the football/soccer world cup.\n\n&gt;$Me: I'm guessing you already tried hooking the laptop to the TV and using $FreeChannelSite to stream the game?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Manager: Yup, but the stream not stable and the Wi-Fi signal to the laptop is very weak.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: What time will $Owner arrive?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Manager: He'll be arriving an hour before the match starts.\n\nLooking at the time it only gave me 5 hours. 4 hours if I exclude the travel time.\n\n&gt;$Me: Alright, I'll pop over and I'll see if I can boost the signal.\n\nI then remembered the VIP room was actually the opposite end away from the router, and that the access point serving the main area is in the floor below, so it makes sense that the room will have almost no signal. Due to the lack of time though, running a cable from the main switch to the room won't be possible, as it will need to go through another private room which is also booked for the evening, and there won't be enough time to tidy the cable away. I searched the office and find a powerline Wi-Fi kit and a Wi-Fi repeater, decommissioned from other sites. Did a quick test with them and they still worked, so factory reset them, configured them with the correct Wi-Fi settings and off I went.\n\nArrived at the site, loaded up the Wi-Fi analyser app on my phone, and confirmed the room was getting a very weak signal, so $Manager was right. I installed the powerlines first, hoping not to resort to the repeater as I knew from experience how unreliable they can be, and $Owner would explode if the stream randomly stopped. One of the powerline modules acts as an access point as well which I know $Owner will want to use. And... it worked. Straight away with no issues. Connected my phone and did a quick speed test, and it was more than fast enough for the stream. Latency was also good too.\n\nThinking I could wrap this up quickly I then proceed to connect the laptop up... only to find while it was connecting, it was not getting a valid IP at all. Restarted the adapter and it still wasn't getting the right network settings. So I restarted the laptop only to find it took a while to boot up. During that, $Manager walks in.\n\n&gt;$Manager: Hey, how's it going? Is it working yet?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: I've managed to boost the signal to the room, and it's a good speed, but the laptop doesn't want to properly connect to it so I'm just restarting it.\n\n$Manager connects his phone to the powerline AP, does a speed test too and he's happy with it.\n\n&gt;$Manager: Wi-Fi is good at least. Forgot to mention but when we connect the laptop to the sound system, there's no sound coming out at all.\n\nOh. Guess this job will take a little longer.\n\n&gt;$Me: Alright I'll have a look once the laptop's ready.\n\n$Manager then goes off back to his job. By then the laptop has finally finished booting up and is happily receiving a valid IP and is able to connect to the internet with no issues. Loaded up the stream and it's running very smoothly.\n\nChecked time and had 3 hours left. No need to worry right? The laptop connected to the TV is happily streaming so let's see why there's no sound. I hook up the sound system to the laptop's audio jack and yup, no sound. Looked at the laptop's sound settings and... yeah, the default sound device was the TV. Switched it over to the correct one and and boom, sound is now going through the sound system. Except... only half the speakers in the room had sound. The other half didn't.\n\nI checked the amplifier and all seemed fine over there, however it was reporting it was only receiving the right sound channel with the left channel receiving nothing. I managed to nail the problem down to the 3.5mm to RCA cable, wiggling the 3.5mm side brings the left channel back but only for a fraction of a second. I went to find $Manager to see if he had any spares, and luckily from the store room there was one. Plugged it in and all was good. Sound is now happily filling the room evenly.\n\nExcept... the stream is for some reason now stuttering. I checked the internet speed again and it was still strong. I then noticed the laptop was a lot warmer than usual. Loaded up task manager and the CPU was on 100&amp;#37;. *Why*. Loaded up the processes, sorted it by CPU usage and there it was. To confirm what I'm seeing I load up the settings and y*up. Windows Update has kicke*d in. This laptop has not been turned on for over a year, and it's eagerly downloading/preparing the Windows 10 Fall Creators update. 2 hours left until $Owner arrives. Seeing there's not much I can do about this, I close the stream so all the laptop's resources can focus on the updates. I also decided to might as well remove the extra stuff installed on the laptop that could also be slowing it down.\n\nAn hour later with the laptop now having less programs running in the background and a lot less running at startup, it was now prompting to restart so it could begin the Fall Creators update. Seeing as how long that will take... not going to happen. I changed the restart option to happen well after the match has finished and changed the active hours to be after closing time. After all, there's also the Spring Creators update it will want to do as well. No time for that. I loaded up the stream, and everything was running smoothly, with just under an hour before $Owner arrives.\n\nI let $Manager know it's all up and running, he has a look and is happy with it. I mention the laptop also wants to update as well and $Manager said he can handle it afterwards. I then make my way home as it's also the end of my shift, expecting a call about $Owner complaining about the laptop randomly restarting. Luckily the laptop didn't restart. Unluckily $Owner was still angry. Mostly because our country lost the match.",

This is a minor case compared to many, but it's significant to me as my first unsolicited tech support request.\n\nI'm halfway done with my computer science degree and while I help immediate family out with tech stuff from time to time, this one's a first. About an hour ago, I got a call from someone who I don't know at all. I didn't hear the phone ring, so she left a message:\n\n&gt; Hi **Dielyr**, this is **JaneDoe**, I'm having a problem with my computer and talked with **FamilyMember** last night who said you could help me. I just need some help getting Microsoft Word compatible with my device, so that I can open resumes. Please call me back at your convenience.\n\nAlong with a text message from **FamilyMember** who almost never texts me: \n\n&gt; Good morning. Hope all is well. My friend **JaneDoe** is gonna call you this morning. She needs your advice on some computer questions and your dad said to ask you cause you can probably help her. I hope you don't mind. Thanks honey, enjoy the day.\n\nThey're seven hours away. I'm going to have to talk this woman through installing Word on what is apparently a vague nonstandard device over the phone with no visual, for free. Since my father refused to help I'm pretty sure it's macOS, which I have no experience with (so wish me luck with describing how to navigate the UI to where she needs to be, as I don't even know what the UI looks like...).\n\nClock's ticking; I'm gonna have to call back soon or else I'll look rude. \n\nEdit: Another family member, **FamilyMember2**, has now called me about it and I couldn't ignore this call - she doesn't want to install Word from Microsoft, she wants Word for free, oh no. His words:\n\n&gt; Did you have a problem with my question? Do you mind doing it for me?\n\nThis is getting much too aggressive for me.\n\nUpdate: I told **FamilyMember2** how to create a Google account and how to upload files to drive so that they can be edited/read. I assume he's passing that information on to her, as he 'had to go' immediately after and didn't instruct me to call her. Hopefully that resolves the issue. I still am pretty indignant about the fact that they volunteered my services to a stranger for free, and then framed it as me doing them a favor after calling me multiple times (**FamilyMember2** called me to ask me only 1.5 hours after the first call from **JaneDoe**). \n\nI understand I completely ignored the advice to just say no, advice that I wholly support and agree with. I am weak and susceptible to guilt trips and \"Oh come on, just do it for me. I'd do the same for you.\" If she still has issues/needs something better, I think I'll just send her the installation page for LibreOffice/OpenOffice and be done with it. Now I need to figure out how best to tell my family what just happened is Not Okay. \n\nUpdate: The Google Drive instructions are \"not working\".\n\nFinal Update: Oh god I'm so glad I never called her back, it was a pdf file so I don't even know if Word would be able to even open it, and now **FamilyMember2** is lecturing me on how if my friends had car questions I'd ask him, so why can't the reverse be true.

So, to give a little bit of context, it happened in 2015 when I was working as T1 Support in HelpDesk, for a very big bank. It was my first real job in the IT world and I received this call after three or four months in the job.\n\n**$Me =&gt; Guess**\n\n**$CB =&gt; Clueless Banker**\n\n&gt; $Me: Hello, $Me, IT Support, how can I be of assistance ?\n\n&gt; $CB: Yes hello, I'm $CB from the $SomeRandomTown banking agency. We just received three bags full of gold coins. What should I do with it ?\n\nAt this point, I stayed silent for a few seconds. That was the first time I ever heard about something like that, and I was still trying to figure out the link between **gold coins** and **IT Support**.\n\n&gt; $Me: Eum... excuse me madam, just to be sure I properly understood, you're calling about... gold coins ?\n\n&gt; $CB: Yes, the money conveyor company just dropped three bags of them here and we don't know what to do with it.\n\n&gt; $Me: Alright madam, if you can just give me a minute to check with our T2 team if we have somekind of... contact or process for this. *Now calling the T2*\n\n&gt; $T2: Hello $Me, what do you want ?\n\n&gt; $Me: Yeah, I'm currently with $CB from $SomeRandomTownBankingAgency and they're calling us because they received three bags of gold coins and they don't know what to do with it.\n\n&gt; $T2: Well, they... wait, what ?\n\n&gt; $Me: They're calling us because they received three bags of gold coins and they don't know what to do with it.\n\n&gt; $T2: Well, give them our address and tell them to send us the bags. If they don't know what to do with it, I sure know what I'm going to do with them ! But yeah, more seriously, we don't handle that, this is the first time I hear about this. Ask them to contact their administrative center in $SomeOtherTown.\n\n*Switching back to $CB*\n\n&gt; $Me: Thank you for your patience, madam. So I've checked with my $T2, we don't manage this kind of... *equipment*... you should contact your administrative center at $AdministrativeCenterPhoneNumber.\n\n&gt; $CB: Alright, will do, thanks !\n\nToday, in 2018, I'm still trying to understand why you would call the IT Support if, as a banker, you don't know what to do with three bags of gold coins.\n\n\nTL;DR =&gt; A banker called the IT Support because their banking agency received three bags of gold coins, and they didn't know what to do with it.\n",

        "text": "So, one of my coworkers $Coworker1 had what was the worst laptop (it's about four years old) at our company. I had told my boss $Boss that I was most concerned about $Coworker1's laptop repeatedly.\n\nNaturally, another coworker $Coworker2 has an issue where his screen is messed up. These guys are out in the field a lot, so I don't necessarily have access to their laptops regularly. So $Boss orders another laptop for $Coworker2, because he can't have $Coworker2 without one.\n\nWhen I finally get $Coworker2's laptop back, I am unable to duplicate the issue he was experiencing. I do open it up and make sure all the connections are connected. At this point $Coworker2 has a new laptop that he's quite happy with -- for once, $Boss listened to me about the amount of RAM he should get for it.\n\nSo I tell $Boss that I am still concerned about $Coworker1's laptop, and it would be cheaper to purchase additional RAM for $Coworker2's old laptop and give that to $Coworker1. He agrees to that. When I inquire about the shipping to choose, $Boss tells me to just give $Coworker2's old laptop to $Coworker1.\n\nThat's not great because we use some syncing software for a much larger amount of data than is recommended, and that software scans its entire directory for changes. I have been over this with $Boss. I've fought to get about half of what is needed for all of the laptops and that's solved a good portion of the issues.\n\nAnother thing that solved one of the issues was when I figured out $Coworker1 had a folder recursion and wasn't able to sync because of it. (There are multiple syncing directories at this point, which I am hesitant to delete in case something we may need is in the wrong one, and of course the syncing software isn't designed to resolve this.)\n\nAnyway, I know that $Coworker2's old laptop is still better than the one $Coworker1 is using. So I diligently start setting it up, anticipating reactions I am likely to get like \"Why is this folder called $Coworker2?\" and resolving them, as well as spending the requisite 72 hours syncing too many files with not enough RAM and doing it on a weekend when it won't be as much of a nuisance.\n\nI get it ready, $Coworker1 is having issues with his laptop, I let him know I have $Coworker2's old laptop. $Coworker1 is at the office the next day and I let him know I am ready for the switch at which point $Coworker1's laptop is suspiciously working fine. I sigh, and resign myself to the fact that I will be ready when it's. . . not.\n\nWe also get a new hire during the period where I'm setting that up, so $Boss orders $Newhire (new hire, new laptop) a new laptop. (It wasn't in the office one morning, so I panicked a little because it was there when I left, but it turned out $Newhire, who wasn't out in the field at that point, picked it up after.) She actually has a pretty decent laptop that she ends up bringing in and pretty much uses that. The new laptop ends up just sitting around for a while.\n\nEventually, $Boss asks me about getting a much more powerful laptop for something $Newhire will be doing. I make a recommendation with a little help from Reddit. $Boss orders it, I set it up and it's for the most part not used on my desk.\n\nEventually, $Newhire wants to use it for the thing she's doing. She tries doing from the file off her flash drive, so I move that file off the drive and run it off the powerful laptop's SSD. Instead of days, it takes less than an hour. Not too long after that, $Newhire starts using that laptop more, moves it to her desk.\n\nThe office manager who cleans helps $Newhire with her desk set up, and encourages her to switch to using the powerful laptop, which makes sense. Then $Officemanager suggests that I give the first laptop we bought for $Newhire to $Coworker1.\n\nSo I talk to $Coworker1 and let him know that we're going to do that and that it's faster than $Coworker1's current laptop. So I set it up for him instead of for $Newhire, spend another 72 hours syncing to his account.\n\nWhile I'm doing that, I compare the CPUs of all the laptops we have and saved the results. I notice that $Coworker3 has the second worst laptop, and again. . . $Coworker2's old laptop is significantly better than the one he's using.\n\nI mention to $Coworker3 that I would like to switch out the one he's using because $Coworker's old one is better. He responds that his is working, so why would we do that?\n\nI ask $Newhire why I keep getting this reaction, and she's not really sure, maybe they're just used to their laptops. She does remind me how $Coworker1 is resistant, having asked me about the new laptop and if it will fit in his bag. I apparently put it next to his current one to demonstrate they are the same size.\n\nSo, today $Coworker1 comes in and it's on his desk and ready (minus some maintenance I had not had time to do). Then he mentions having some stuff on the old laptop that he would like to transfer, which is fine by me. But I do tell him that I would like him to start using the new one. As I am doing some setup stuff for him, **he asks me if it's a cheap laptop.**\n\nI pull up my comparison of the CPUs of our laptops and read off the benchmarks, something like 1900 on the old one, compared to 4016 on the new one. $Coworker1 then states that's four hundred times as fast, and I repeat the numbers and state the benchmark's a little over twice as much.\n\n$Newhire gets in a little later today (she's been out in the field). Then:\n\n&gt;$Coworker1: Wow, this laptop is really zoomin'.\n\n&gt;$Newhire: See? That's why when OP tries to replace your laptop you shouldn't resist.\n\n&gt;$Coworker1: I wasn't resisting.\n\n&gt;$Newhire: You were asking if it would fit in your bag, is this a good computer. . .\n\n&gt;$Coworker1: I didn't do any of that.\n\n&gt;$Officemanager: *laughing* 20 minutes ago you asked if it was a cheap laptop!\n\n$Newhire and I were both laughing really hard after that.\n\nSet it to defragment as I was leaving.\n\nTL;DR: Trust your IT guy when he says a laptop is better than your current one.\n\n(Edit: Formatting dialogue)\n\n(Edit 2: Changed naming scheme)",

Walked to her desk, asked to preview the print from the Outlook, then i can see the Uber receipt screenshot from her phone in the email. Then she told there's nothing in the print preview (thank god she was not printing straightaway or else forests in Brazil would weep), first page was her email header, subject then a blank body, after that next page also blank with her email signature.\n\nIt took me less than a second to realize that she scrolls to the next page by dragging the scroll bar thus skipping to the last page which also blank body and her email signature. Then i asked her just to click on the page selector then there it is, Uber receipt in the second page. Then we had a good laugh together before I peaced out back to my dungeon. ",

If it was possible to break a computer by looking at it, she could do it.\n\n$E2: Employee 2, 28 year old customer service rep, filling in the order processing role as our normal employee who processes orders is out on maternity leave.\n\n$me: yours truly.\n\nBefore we get going, let’s talk about this maternity leave thing. We’ll call this person $Mom. 9 months ago, when $Mom found out she was pregnant, she told management that she thought $E1 would be the best person to train to fill in while shes out, because $E2 is cross trained in Shipping and Engineering (our engineering department is not filled with engineers. They just put together samples that a customer requests before placing an order)\n\n$mom is right, with $E2 being the most flexible CS Rep, we shouldn’t also rely on her to do processing because if Shipping or Engineering is short handed, she has to go there to fill in. So we train $E1. 6 months of training later, and management is basically giving $mom the “what the fuck is going on” look because E1 still doesn’t have the hang of it. We make an executive decision. $E1 can’t handle the job, we’ll change tactics, have have $E2 fill in. She trained for 2 weeks, had it down, and no issues. \n\n$Mom had her baby last week.\n\n$E1 is micromanaging the shit out of $E2. And she’s generally just a pain in the ass overall.\n\nThen I get this email.\n\n$E1: “Hey $Me, can you go in the $EXCELFILENAME.XLSX and delete the word “BUYOUT” from the notes column on item XYZ for $E2? She’s processing a new order but we’re going to make it here instead of buying it this time.”\n\n$Me: “Thanks $E1. $E2, is this actually something you need help with?”\n\n$E2: “No. i just click the cell and press delete right?”\n\n$Me: “Yep. Thanks everyone.”\n\nI think I earned my paycheck today just for not hurling insults.",
