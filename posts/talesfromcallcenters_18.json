        "text": "Today's most frustrating call.\n\nInbound call:\n\nMe: Hello you're through to -redacted- how can I help?\n\nCaller (customers husband): Hello I received a missed call.\n\nM: Ah yes it looks like we were looking to speak to ... we had an update that we needed to speak to her about.\n\nC: so why are you calling MY number.\n\nM: this is the only number on file she must have given it as her primary contact when she signed up with us.\n\nC: you're a liar, no she didn't. Stop calling me.\n\nM: I'm sorry, if you would like I can update the number so that we call her instead. What should I change it to?\n\nC: No you're not you're taking my number off the system. \n\nM: (actually hasn't got the authority to remove the number but can request it get updated, we are telephone based so removing the number isn't exactly helpful) well I can't do that. I can update it or let the system call you. We need a contact number. What number would she like us to use?\n\nC: no you're not listening. Stop calling me. She doesn't want anything to do wit you anymore and I will escalate this if you keep calling me.\n\n(This is an automated dailler because there is action needed on her file... it will ring every three hours until this is completed... nothing I can do about that) \n\nM: if she wants to cancel she needs to write I to the cancellation team and they will handle that. I can't take your number off our system nor can I simply cancel her file at your  request. I can update the number or she can write in.\n\nC: you're lying. I know you're lying now listen here stop calling me.\n\nRepeat for a good half hour... before he hangs up.\n\nWhy are some people so dense. \nI get it. You don't want calling. But you're not the client. You can't make decisions for her. But you can take the options I have given you. \n\nHanging up on me changes nothing.\n\n\n  EDIT: in regards to the harassment allegations.\nNope I'm not harassing anyone, at least I'm not trying to. Basically it's a claim that the customer is going through and what I do takes literally 10 minutes and is crucial to the process. 99% of clients only get called for a day or two and answer the phone or call back and do what needs doing and we don't bother them again till the end of the process. Others like the one above think that they're smart and will just ignore us or shout at us and lie about being called 30 times a day. We don't. It's maybe 1/2 calls depending on how many other people we are calling, 3 hours is the minimum time for it to call back.  As I said to him if she doesn't want to deal with us and wants to cancel then she needs to write in. Simple. \n\nI however as a lowly call center employee have nothing but connex dailler. All I can do is click \"done\" or \"hang up\" \"no answer\" ect. And I can email my manager to change the number and that person is blocked from being called until the file is updated. \n\nIt wasn't even his file. She had given his number when she returned the paperwork. If it's wrong I can get it updated. If she wants to cancel, she can tell us so in writing like it said so in her agreement. It's not rocket science. ",

Do you want to know if there is gluten in your 100% whole wheat bread? Call me.\n\nYesterday, due to Thanksgiving here in the states, work was stupidly busy. Most calls were about lifespan of food, how to cook something, can you defrost a 22 pound turkey in 24 hours. Normal stuff. \n\nThen Random Lady calls in. She bought some yogurt that was accidentally frozen at the store. She kept laughing about how absurd it was. Then she told me that the container somehow fell/hit her causing her to have a black eye.\n\nRL then says that she goes to the hospital a lot and they asked her if she was being abused. She tells them no and that her black eye was from yogurt.\n\nAt this point, my mood had steadily grown blacker because RL was not giving me the info I needed to help her. I was also dealing with stomach cramps due to eating cream in my dinner the night before that I didn't realize was there (I'm lactose intolerant).\n\nAfter getting a random bit of info out of her, she tells me she is anorexic.\n\nAfter some more general conversation, she tells me she's dying.\n\nBy this point, I had already helped her and was just mostly listening to her prattle on. I was now paying attention. She then asks me if I want to hear a joke. \n\nRL: What's Smokey the Bear's middle name?\n\nMe: I don't know.\n\nRL: It's \"the\".\n\nAfter that, we laughed and she got off the phone. I sat at my desk and cried. Her casualness about dying had just struck me as amazing. It helped me not be in my head for a moment and be grateful for my life. \n\nI hate this time of year. I did 15 years in retail and now 3 years in call centers. People are crass, attention seeking, petty, selfish, and assholes this time of year. Every year, I struggle just getting through the holidays.\n\nThis woman helped me in ways she will never know.\n\nHappy holidays folks.",

        "text": "I do [break/fix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break/fix) &amp; managed services tech support from home.  Service is provided as 'white-label' (no branding for the company I actually work for) to an ISP, as an incredibly inexpensive add-on.\n\nThe ISP recently did a full roll-out, and dropped the startup fee to $0.  It's honestly a great deal, and I trust my co-workers to do just as good a job as we do.  It's a great product for the non-tech savvy to have a tech that can remote-in at any time and help them.\n\nProblem is, the roll-out and price change went way too fast.  The ISP's first line has near-zero training on what we can and can't help with, what they support themselves because we don't have access to their databases, and are horrible at disclosing the cost of service.  Instead, they just seem to add our service, randomly, to people's accounts, and make us do their job for them.\n\nWe're pushing against that; hard.  We can't control their actions, of course, and while our name never enters into the picture, it's just not good business.  Even discounting that aspect of things, we were not ready for the roll-out, as the ISP kinda sprung it on us without warning.  We went from 5-10 minutes between calls on average, to a 10+ queue at all times, and hold times in the 30-40 minute range (malware removal takes time).\n\nWork has been... insane.  I've been pulling near-50/week, with some of my colleagues putting in 60/week.  That, plus the constant queue and stacking calls 3-4 deep has made me feel I'm not doing my job well for each call, and it sucks.\n\nWe just had our first training group hit the floor... and what a relief it has been.  They're still 'in training' for the week, of course, so it does pick up at night when their gigantic shift drops off phones to regroup and train and such... but it's already night and day.\n\nI'm not buried under an avalanche of people ticked off at stupid transfers and extreme hold times.  I'm able to chat with the other agents, and help out the new ones, even be a bit goofy in chat!  I'm able to tear apart and learn new stuff about the various malware/threats I'm encountering without worry, and actually write-up a couple articles on how to combat some of this stuff.  It is way more relaxed and productive, honestly, for all of us.\n\nStaffing issues suck.",

It’s a method of validation that many companies had. \n\n\nDD: (proceeds to fight me, yell and swear at me for trying to validate him before I’ve had enough of this.)\n\n\nMe: Okay sir, validating You is for the protection and privacy of your account. If you do not provide me the information, I will not be able to assist you. \n\n\nDD: Validate, my ass! There’s nothing to be protected, the account is disconnected!!! (Nonetheless, finally validates account but still swearing at me) I made a payment a few days ago and I want the late payment charge waived. \n\n\nMe: (the late payment charge is $6.66 which is funny because I thought this customer was the literal devil) unfortunately sir, this bill was due October 30th and like you said, you just paid it a few days ago and it hasn’t even posted to the account yet. This charge is valid as your payment was made late. \n\n\nDD: This is fucking disgusting. Put me to someone who will help me. \n\n\nMe: There’s nobody that can help you. The charge will not be reversed, it’s valid as the payment was late. \n\n\nDD: Oh, so you’re the supervisor are you?\n\n\nMe: Nope! If you would like to speak with one, you’ll receive a callback within 48 hours. What’s the best number to reach you at?\n\n\nDD: Nope. You’re lying to me. You’re all just alone there with no supervisors? I want to speak to him now. \n\n\n(Basically just repeating the same stuff, our policy is that they will get a call back in 48 hours. Managers don’t take live calls as we are short staffed and don’t even have enough for the floor)\n\n\nDD: You’re literally making all of this up. You think you’re God. \n\n\nMe: Sir, if I was God, do you really think I’d choose to work in a call centre? Nevertheless, I can see if I can find somebody but I can’t guarantee I will be able to. \n\n\n(I explained the situation to a TL, and he’s telling me to just give the customer the credit to get him off the line but I’m like, dude NO. I would HAPPILY waive the charge if he was nice and asked me but instead he was rude, swore at me and called me a liar. No way. This is a VALID charge and I’m not giving him ANYTHING dude. So my TL says ok, we’ll see if he has the reference number for the payment he made, and then we’ll see about waiving the charge.) \n\n\nTL: (takes over the call; I can hear the customer trash talking me and my customer service; once my TL asks for the reference number for the payment, the customer hung up.)\n\n\n\n\n\n(I also had 2 y-corders on this call listening in and they were so shocked that I managed to stay sweeter than friggin sugar on this entire call even through the customer calling me names and trashing me; and also wondering why people are so crappy for literally no reason. TLDR; customer fights me when I try to validate, fights me for not waiving a valid charge, says I think I’m God and hangs up when we ask for proof of payment..) ",

So what shall I put down as the reason for the appointment?\n\nDL: just put undisclosed. I need to find a doctor who’s not one of the bad doctors. I though dr. X would be fine but he just really committed an ethical violation and I can prove it. \n\nMe: Alright I’ll look into that. [starts pulling up all the attending provider’s schedules at the clinic. It’s a huge clinic so there’s a lot. I let her ramble on while I’m weeding through the list to pull out the residents]\n\nDL: You see, Dr. X won’t give me my pain medication. I bought some Oxycodone from my cousin because I couldn’t get anymore from the clinic and when I told dr. X he said I’m in violation of my opioid contract and said that if I ever do that again that I’ll never get anymore pain medication! He can’t do that! That’s so unethical!\n\nMe: [makes reassuring “Yes I’m listening” noises]\n\nDL: And he told me that I’m delusional and that there’s no such thing as the cannabis genocide but there is! So many children died thanks to the cannabis industry. My husband died because of the cannabis industry genocide. So you see, Dr. X doesn’t believe me. I can’t trust him. I need to see another doctor who will believe me. \n\nMe: [uh...]\n\nDL: [continues to talk about crack pot theories for awhile]\n\nMe: Alright DL. I have an appointment tomorrow with Dr. Y tomorrow and he’s an attending provider. \n\nDL: I’ll take it! Thank you so much! Please don’t buy from any commercial pot shop. Only buy black market. And make sure you google the cannabis genocide!\n\n*click*\n\nI took a look at this lady’s chart after the call out of morbid curiosity. She’d been sending cryptic emails to her doctor that sounded like incantations in old English for a long time now. Apparently this is just something she does in a regular basis. The nurse notes said things like “patient wouldn’t stop talking about her political theories again”. What a trip. ",

I shouldn't be held responsible for anything under that name anymore since it isn't me anymore!\n\n\nMe: I do apologize but legally changing you name doesn't just get rid of all your debts you owe, it is still owed and tied to your SS number.  If that was the case people would just pay the cost to change their name instead of paying all their bills.\n  \n\nSub: I will be contacting my lawyer and the ACLU if you don't give me service under Chelsea! You don't want to play this game here boy.\n\n\nMe: Due to threat of legal action I am ending this call and locking the account pending a review from our legal team. We will be expecting their call regarding this issue. Thank you for calling ISP and have a great day.\n\n\nSub: Wait, Don't end the call!\n\n\nMe: *Click*\n\n\nThey have no called back yet....surprising. \n\n\n\n",

Only person she has spoken with in 6 months was me. I documented the account in detail in August. I use very specific phrasing and include details when dealing with an account that a customer wants closed that I've convinced them to keep, both to cover my butt and to allow whoever speaks to them next to know what they've been offered.\n\nSo long story short, I am able to verify by my own notes that she is lying through her teeth. Of course, she didn't write my name down, so she doesn't realize I'm now the supervisor she's speaking to.\n\nI mute the phone while she chatters, lean back in my chair and have a bit of a chuckle, and then politely perform the cancellation and all other account actions. I was kind enough to not mention I was the one she had spoken with in August (also if we disagree with something a customer says, we get in trouble).\n\nThis happens a lot, but usually it's someone else who talked to them before when they claim they cancelled, and I can never be 100% sure of someone else's actions",

        "text": "So currently I work in a call center of sorts. Most of the time that I'm answering the phone, it's rather mundane. I'm lucky enough, that I don't have to deal with consumers, but rather I deal with techs that work with consumers, and the occasional company that works with or purchases from us. Anyways, like I said, most of the time, when I answer the phone, it's rather boring stuff that no one could possibly find interesting. However, there's always been one call that stands out in my mind as the most amusing thing to happen while on the job. One of our techs had called in, seemingly pretty flustered by something, and needed information about [I signed a contract so I can't really say]. So I go through the regular routine of looking up what he was asking and relaying to him any information I thought he'd need. At this point, I'd assumed that he and I were the only ones on the line. But as soon as I was finished, I hear him say \"Alright [Name redacted], did you get all of that?\" and to my surprise, I hear a female respond \"Super, that's just about everything we need!\" Slightly confused at first, I eventually recognized the voice and responded \"Glad to help.\" After all, I'm on the phones often and just wanted to go back to whatever I was doing that night.  The tech then said, \"Hey thanks again man,\" and then Immediately, without missing a beat, proclaims \"Alright [Name redacted], I hope you have a sweet night babe, You know how to contact me if you need me.\" I thought to myself, \"WFT did my tech just start flirting with one of the call center girls?\" but assumed I had misheard him. I quickly realized that I was the third wheel in this phone call because she then said, \"Don't worry baby, I've got you on speed dial.\" They fucking flirted with each other for another 5 mins, while I awkwardly sat on the line in disbelief! Eventually, I had to put my phone on speaker, so that my coworkers could understand my facial expressions. We ended up all snickering and trying not to laugh too loudly while listening in on these two, who by the way, in all likelihood, live in different states! I let it go on for another 5 mins or so, before chiming in and saying \"I really should get off the line just in case anyone's trying to call in.\" To which the tech replied with \"Oh shit! You were supposed to hang up bro!\" And maybe I should have, maybe I could have ended my time as their third wheel sooner. But then I'd never know of the beautiful Paramore between a tech, and a call center lady who probably lives in Mexico. ",

        "text": "This story is sort of a retail, customer service, call center tale combined, but since it physically took place inside a call center, that's where I'm posting it.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I worked in the small call center of an online retailer that sold wigs, extensions, pieces, falls, etc, and all sorts of hair-related accessories. I took calls from customers who had all sorts of questions, but most of the people who called were just looking for a Return Authorization number so they could send something back.\n\nWhen people placed orders on the website, they would stack up on a list, and at around 1-2pm, they would be \"processed\", meaning one of the grumpy girls I worked with would call each of the wig manufacturers one by one and order the wigs from the list. When people chose regular shipping, the wig manufacturers would send us the wigs all in one shipment, and we would send them to customers individually, along with any accessories they might have ordered (we stocked all the accessories in the call center). If someone chose expedited shipping, we asked the manufacturer to drop ship directly to the customer, and we would ship them any accessories separately. Expedited shipping was guaranteed in 3 businesses days.\n\nOne day I answered the phone and there was a man on the other end. He was calling for his wife, who he said had placed an order for a wig and some accessories with expedited shipping, and while the accessories had arrived, the wig had not come, and she had ordered a wig, so she was very upset and wanted compensation. He was very calm and polite, and had the order number ready when I asked for it, so I could look up the order and verify what he was telling me.\n\nSure enough, what he told me about the order was correct, a wig and accessories with expedited shipping, placed two business days before. I explained to him the way our shipping worked, and that the wig would be coming separately, which he understood just fine, and tried to explain to his wife. I could hear her in the background. \"Unhappy\" was an understatement. She was *pissed* that when she placed her order she had not been told that it would be arriving in two separate boxes. The husband relayed this to me in the most diplomatic way he could muster. Ok, sure, that was our bad, the website should have said to expect more than one shipment, and I apologized for that. But then there was still the fact that her wig was late.\n\nBut her wig wasn't late! Expedited shipping was guaranteed in 3 businesses days, and today was day 2. So it wasn't that her wig was late, the accessories had simply shown up a day early. I even contacted the manufacturer during our call to make sure her wig would be there the next day, and the tracking number they gave me indicated that this was, in fact, the case.\n\nThe man on the phone was nothing but cordial to me and had the patience of a saint as he tried to explain this to his angry wife, but she would have none of it. She was yelling and ranting in the background, screaming that we were trying to take advantage of her because she had cancer and was in a vulnerable state from her chemotherapy. She was so angry about the whole thing that she had her husbabnd get an RA number from me, so that when her wig arrived the next day, on time, just like we guaranteed, she could make her husband pack up the entire order and send it back for a refund. He apologized to me and his wife started yelling at him for \"taking my side.\"\n\nI wish I could remember better what all she had said, but mostly I just remember the resignation in that poor man's voice. I wonder how often he was in that position, having to apologize to an innocent customer service person who was honestly trying to help, only to be the recipient of a completely irrational diatribe from a woman who thought the entire world was conspiring to make her miserable.\n\nWhen we received the return, the man had written a very sweet note thanking me for being so patient and helpful. I wonder if they're still married, or if she's even still alive. I wonder what she was like before she got sick, and if her personality ever recovered.\n\n**TL;DR** A woman was so upset that she hadn't been told that her order would arrive in two separate boxes that she sent the entire order back for a refund.",

        "text": "Here's another story from when I worked as a senior billing agent for Canadian cell provider \"Red\". As a senior agent, I was authorized to take supervisor escalations while supporting the agents who were actually taking calls. As a point of knowledge, agents were encouraged to find the reason for the caller's issue before escalating to a supervisor.\n\nThe Cast:\n\n$Me: guess who?  \n$Veronica: our plucky new agent. Quiet, collected, new to call centres, and so, a little unsure  \n$AC: Angry customer\n\n\nThe sun was bright, and our hearts were light, as our story begins... (Who am I kidding. It was a call centre.) I was on support, as a new crop of ~~suckers~~ agents joined the production floor, fresh out of the training queue. While assisting one agent, I overheard the alarming word \"supervisor\". Ruh-roh. I start listening, just in case I need to take over.  \nWe join a call already in progress...\n\n&gt;$Veronica: Yes sir. I'd be happy to get you a supervisor. Can I please get the reason you need a supervisor? \n \nBrt, brt, brt, brt. (This is the spillover from her headset)  \n&gt;$Veronica: I understand sir. I just need the reason you need a supervisor.  \n\nRinse and repeat for about 5 minutes.  \n\n&gt;$Veronica: Please hold while I investigate the situation.  &lt;stabs the hold button like it was Caesar, and she, Brutus&gt;  \n&gt;$Veronica: &lt;wails&gt; Urashk! What do I do??  \n&gt;$Me: He has given you no reason to speak to a supervisor?  \n&gt;$Veronica: He says I don't need to know!  \n&gt;$Me: You're doing the exact right thing. Just keep repeating that without a reason, there is no transferring to a supervisor. We need the customer to know that an agent can resolve the issue 99% of the time.  \n&gt;$Veronica: OK. &lt;deep breath&gt;  \n&gt;$Me: You can do this!  \n&gt;$Veronica: Sir, at this point, to transfer you to a supervisor, I need a reason.  \n\nBRT BRT, BRT BRT BRT!  \n$Veronica stabs the mute button, and turns to me with unshed tears in her eyes.  \n&gt;$Veronica: He just called me a useless waste of space!  \n\nOh no, you didn't.  \nIt. Is. On.  \n\n&gt;$Me: I got this.  \n\nHeadset on.  \n\n&gt;$AC: ....and furthermore, I am going to make it my mission in life to ensure you NEVER work for &lt;Red&gt; again!  \n&gt;$Me: This is Urashk. I am $Veronica's supervisor, and I understand you need to speak with me about an issue you refuse to provide to her?  \n&gt;$AC: Thank G$d! You have the rudest, most ignorant people working for you! I want you to fire her! She was **so rude** to me, and...  \n&gt;$Me: &lt;interrupting&gt; You, sir, will stop lying to me immediately. I have been monitoring $Veronica's side of this call, and she has handled herself with dignity and professionalism. This is how the call is going to continue. I will pass you back to $Veronica. You *will* apologize to her. You will answer her questions. If an escalation to a supervisor is **required**, I will then take over the call. I am I making myself clear?  \n&gt;$AC: Buh...buh...buh...  \n&gt;$Me: Thank you for your patience.  \n\nI hand the headset back to $Veronica, while keeping one eye on the phone status. &lt;Call status - After Call&gt;  \nHe hanged up. Heh.  \n\n&gt;$Me: Problem? Solved.  \n\nCheering. Celebrations. I am carried out on the shoulders of grateful ~~peons~~ agents. Joking. We all went back to work.  \nAs a follow up, I reviewed the account history, and, lo and behold, *he actually did need a supervisor override to add a grandfathered feature*. BWAHAHAHAHA!! Fifteen seconds of politeness would have fixed the issue, and avoided a verbal smackdown.  \n\nTL;DR: Be nice to agents, or supervisors will not be nice to you.",

He can't even close the buckle. He's gone over the specs (we have the specs for every clothing item we sell) with the previous rep and his belt is ONE! AND ONE-EIGHTH INCHES! off spec. So he is irate. He also says that his other, two-year-old belt THAT SAYS 42 ON THE INSIDE, is THREE INCHES bigger than our current spec for size 42 belts. \n\nNot surprised dude, that belt has been living under your fat sweaty gut for two years and I'm sure it's been stretched more than a little. Of course, I don't say this. I'm still in the listening stage.\n\nConveniently, the measurement he gives me for the old belt that fits is exactly ON spec for the size 44 belt.\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience and offer to ship him a new belt without charging his credit card if he will kindly return the too-small belt within 10 business days per our policy. I recommend size 44 because the spec corresponds to what fits him.\n\nThe dude goes OFF.\n\nHOW DARE YOU. I TAKE A SIZE 42 BELT. I WANT A SIZE 42 BELT THAT IS THE SAME AS THE ONE I HAVE.\n\nHe keeps yelling for a couple more minutes and I shut down. I am done being invested in his satisfaction because he has shown me that he is determined *not* to be satisfied; and the reason he is angry has nothing to do with me, or belts. So I decide to bide my time until he uses profanity, which will allow me to hit \"release,\" or until he stops yelling long enough for me to politely reiterate his options and ask what he would like me to do.\n\nWhile he's rage-spitting into his phone, I peruse his purchase history. Every pair of pants he's bought from us in the past two years is size 44. He also owns a size 42 *and* a size 44 belt, and never returned the 44. So yeah. Dude gained weight, probably stretched his size 42 belt out and is now mad at me because I can't magically do that to the brand-new belt before it ships.\n\nHe says, \"I DON'T WANT A SIZE 44 BELT, I WANT A SIZE 42 BELT THAT IS ON SPEC! IF YOU PEOPLE [oy with the \"you people\"!] CAN'T PROVIDE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SIZED THE SAME WAY EVERY TIME THEN WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE THAT THE SIZE 44 BELT WILL BE ON SPEC?\" \n\nUm, because you're fat*** and you take a size 44? (Again, not stated aloud because I like being employed.)\n\nCustomer decides to return the 42 for a refund and will find a belt from a local retailer. Hopefully he will find one that does vanity sizing for men. I don't know of any, but maybe they exist ...\n\nFatphobia is a bitch, man. But suck it up. Buy the clothes that fit in the first place and vent your spleen to a therapist, not a $12 an hour retail CSR.\n\n_____\n\n***No judgment on fatties, I'm fat AF and accept my body -- and I believe in buying clothes that fit and make me feel good, regardless of the number on the tag.",

        "text": "My first call center job was in the mid 90's.  I worked at a call center for an international set of chain hotels.  This was before the internet was a place to get hotel information, for the most part.\n\nAnyway, one day the phone rings and I answer the call with our standard greeting; \"thanks for calling xxxxxxx inn, I'm sodabased; what city and state can I help you with\"  I can't tell you the word for word dialogue after that, but suffice to say the caller states that he put a bomb in the building.  \n\nI was fairly young, and inexperienced, but I knew that we needed to ask follow up questions.  I had an instruction book at work which I knew covered emergencies, such as a bomb threat.   I rapidly searched for it.\n\nI asked him where it was?  What building?  What city, what state? (since we were a call center for a set of chains of hotels we couldn't assume the \"bomber\" knew where he was calling; he could think it was one of the other call centers or he could think it was a hotel.)\n\nI found the instruction book.  I asked all the follow up questions.  As I did so I stood up and started gesturing like a mad-man.    One of my coworkers noticed my crazy gesturing and approached; I mouthed to her \"bomb threat\".   She ran to get one of the managers.\n\nThe phone call continued.   The \"bomber\" refused to answer anything, but he also wasn't hanging up.   All he'd do is tell me that he placed a bomb and that it was going to go off soon.   I kept asking him the questions in the book.  Finally the caller disconnected the call.\n\nManagement had been listening in the call since they were notified.  I got up and ran to the management raised cubicle thing they sat in and told them everything I knew.\n\nAfter telling the manager, not my manager, but the manager on duty, everything the following is the best my memory can remember:\n\nMe: Do you want me to help announce the evacuation?\n\nManager: We don't know if we're evacuating yet, we have to see if we think its a credible threat.\n\nMe:   Who's we?\n\nManager:  The management team, you can go back to the phones.  If we're going to evacuate, we'll announce it as soon as we figure it out.\n\nMe:   Yay, I'm going to be outside until the building is checked by the cops.\n\nI quickly went over to my area and said very loudly.  \n\nMe:  There's been a bomb threat.\n\nEveryone just got up and started to leave the building.   There had been several bomb threats there that summer, and I guess the managers thought that they could decide if a bomb threat seemed credible; I thought fuck that, I'm not getting killed because a call center manager thought the threat wasn't credible.\n\nThe cops came and left; I assume no bomb was found, but better safe than sorry.   I didn't get in any trouble, but had they written me up for it, I wouldn't have signed it.",

We are a very specialized company and if I am any more specific it would be very easy to identify who I work for. The type of training this woman needed is not important, it was her reaction to everything I said :)\n\n\n\nMe: _______, this is Sh605. How can I help you?\n\n\n\nC: I need training, please.\n\n\n\nM: Ok, what are you needing training with?\n\n\n\nC: Everything, I have never worked with your company before.\n\n\n\nM: Can I get you to log in to our website so I can direct you to the training videos available there?\n\n\n\nC: NO! I want PROPER training, or I will cancel my account. This is ridiculous, I've been on hold for over an hour! (Lol, no) If you can't be bothered to train me then I want your supervisor because I think you're being very rude.\n\n\n\nM: (a little taken aback as I've said about 3 sentences to her so far) Ma'am, it's not that I don't want to help you, it's just that we already have these very helpful videos available to first-time users like yourself. I also have a lot of people waiting to speak to me who need help just like you do, who may have an issue not already addressed on the website. If you need further assistance after watching the videos, I am happy to provide either my direct line or the number to this department if you would like to speak to someone else.\n\n\n\nC: NO! I want YOU to train me! Someone told me if I called you would walk me through all of this! I want to speak to the most senior official you have at your company! I'm not happy at all with your service and if you don't train me RIGHT NOW your boss will hear about your attitude after I cancel my account!\n\n\n\nM: I'm sorry if you feel that I was rude to you. Please hold while I try to find you a supervisor to speak to.\n\n\n\nAt that point, I was getting pretty upset and shaky. It's hard to make it clear over text how loud and snarky her tone of voice was, I know it doesn't seem like she was being too crazy but her attitude was starting to rattle me. I went to my boss and explained what just happened, my coworker who sits behind me spoke up and said she had been listening and I was never once rude to this person. My boss had my back the whole time, it's a small group so we all hear each other speak to callers and I'm known to always be polite and to have a very gentle, calm customer service voice. \n\n\n\nShe said to send the call over so I put my headset back on and got ready to hear some more yelling before I transferred her.\n\n\n\nM: Ma'am, I have a supervisor ready to take your call. Please hold while I get you over to her.\n\n\n\nC: Oh, I don't want to talk to her. I just want YOU to train me.\n\n\n\nM: I'm sorry, but again, what you're asking me for is available online and I do need to assist other callers. \n\n\n\nC: I don't understand! Why can't you just help me with *very basic, easy thing to do on the website* Do you just not care?? TRAIN ME NOW! I will not get off the phone or be transferred unless YOU walk me through every step of this!\n\n\n\nM: *giving in because my hands are shaking too badly to even properly hit the buttons to transfer and I just want to get off the phone* Are you logged in right now?\n\n\n\nC: Yes!\n\n\n\n\nM: *very brief, basic explanation*\n\n\n\nC: Oh, ok. And how do I *other very basic thing*\n\n\n\nM: *another quick explanation*\n\n\n\nC: Got it. Thanks for your time, I appreciate you! *immediately hangs up*\n\n\nM: What the fuck just happened?\n\n\n\nIn the middle of the call, the thought this was some sort of prank or test crossed my mind. She snapped so quickly she had me second guessing everything I had said, thinking I must have done something without even knowing for her to react so suddenly. I think that's part of why it got to me so much, but my boss was fine with everything I said and looking back, I almost feel like she was threatening me to get me to do something she just couldn't be bothered to watch a video on. A video that was far more detailed and would probably have been more helpful than my rushed explanation was, as it actually shows the website in action and I had to just describe it.",

Rather than taking calls, though, I had been handling emails sent to us by customers. One of the things we handle via email is, if someone sends us a letter by standard mail, someone in a receiving office somewhere scans the contents of that letter and sends it to us to respond by phone or email. A lot of times customers fail to provide enough info for us to ever actually contact them back, or they have doctor's handwriting so we can't parse their letters anyway, but we respond as much as we can.\n\nFor this particular letter, the customer stated they had found a foreign object in the store brand canned tuna. Fun, food safety issues. That's a whole lot of extra stuff I've gotta do now.\n\n... And they included that foreign object with the letter. \"What?\" I think as I look through the low quality black and white scan the receiving office had sent us. Sure enough, the receiving office saw fit to scan this foreign object for us as well, some sort of fleshy mass, possibly fish skin? I had no fucking clue, and the quality of the scan didn't help.\n\nI call the receiving office to see if someone could take a picture of it with their phone or something so I could get a better idea. Nah, they threw that out like a week ago, it was gross. Fantastic.\n\nI try to find an account based on the return address from the letter. No dice. We've got more than a hundred people with their name in our system, too. No way am I going to bother sifting through that. \n\nIn the end, the letter gets forwarded off to food safety without much getting done about it. Customer never gets a call back, and the weird fish skin mystery remains unsolved to this day.",

I would be happy to forward you to our financial department so you can update your payment information though, and then they can get you back up and running!\n&gt; C: um, no, welfare f***ing told me they would cover it.\n&gt; S (rolling her eyes at me): ma’am, I see here that welfare covers your phone bill because that’s considered a necessity, but your cable is not. So no, they won’t cover that.\n&gt; C: THEY F***ING TOLD ME -\n&gt; S (getting nervous about the language with her 14 year-old sister listening in): excuse me, ma’am, but this is a business line, so I’m going to have to ask you to refrain from using that lang -\n&gt; C: WELL I DON’T GIVE A F***! *click*\n\nMy sister and I just sat there staring at each other for a solid 30 seconds, and then burst out laughing. She then updated the notes about the call (excessive cursing, thinks welfare is paying for her cable, etc) on the woman’s account. Just out of curiosity, we decided to look through the other notes. Much the same.\n\nI wish I knew what ended up happening with that woman. I don’t think my sister ever got her again.",

If we couldn’t answer, you’d leave a voicemail. The company wasn’t big but it was big enough to afford a better phone system. It was so backward.\n\nAnd my boss? Oh she was a doozy. She was the poster child for horrible female bosses using bitchiness to gain respect. (She didn’t get it but she thought she did) She was everything wrong. I’ve never had a more horrible boss than her. \n\nSo anyway. It was a Friday at my call in center. Friday’s were really slow phone days and was a great day to catch up on everything else. We could go 10 mins between calls whereas on Mondays it never stopped ringing. It’s just how it was. \n\nI was so busy catching up this one Friday it didn’t dawn on me that the phones weren’t ringing. \n\nMy coworker noticed first and I agreed I hadn’t taken a call yet even tho we had been there nearly an hour. As we were attempting to see if there was a problem our boss (picture Ursula, as this boss was over weight with a knee issue rambling down the aisle at us) began screaming at us as to why we were not answering our phones. We worked amongst other departments so this was very embarrassing. \n\nBoss: (literally screaming) what do you think you are doing?!?! Why are you not answering your phones?? Why are you not doing your job??? I just got off the phone with sue and she said they’ve been getting bombarded with calls and you’re not picking up!!!!\n\nMe: our phones have not rung all morning. \n\nBoss: that’s a lie!!! How dare you!\n\nMe: I’m not lying. (My coworkers nod in agreement). They’ve not rung and we were just trying to figure out what was wrong. We think there’s an issue with the phones \n\nBoss: I don’t believe you. \n\nMe: go ahead and call the number. Here, I’ll call from my cell phone. See it’s not ringing. \n\nBoss: hmphgg well, SOMEthing is going on. \n\nSo it turns out something random and technical had happened that I don’t recall, phones got working again and started ringing. \n\nBoss never said a word to us. No apology, no amends. She took her two hour lunch and left early. 😒\n\n\n\n",

The campaign I worked on dealt with multiple lines of business including a rewards scheme.\n\nIn this call, the customer's reward points had been trickling down day by day for weeks. This is because points you earn have an expiry date and will disappear if not spent. It's explained in the terms and conditions and has always been a policy of ours.\n\n**ME:** Thank you for calling ###, my name is ###, can I start by taking your name please?\n\n**CUSTOMER:** Customer.\n\n**ME:** Thanks. How can I help you today?\n\n**CUSTOMER:** Now this has been going on for the past few weeks. I've noticed that my points have been getting lower and lower and at first I thought I was going crazy until I started making a list...\n\n*(She begins to make a list of her point totals on each day for the past few weeks, which is rather lengthy and goes on for several minutes. I try to interject but she shushes me, so I just let her ramble on.)*\n\n**CUSTOMER:** ...so why is this happening?\n\n**ME:** I can check for you. Can I take your postcode and the first line of your address please so that I can find your account?\n\n**CUSTOMER:** *(gives address)*\n\n**ME:** Okay, I have your account in front of me. I can see that your points have been expiring over the past few weeks. Points will begin expiring after this amount of time if unspent and we encourage our members to spend them frequently.\n\n**CUSTOMER:** What? I had no clue this was happening. I've been saving these points for a rainy day and you've been stealing them from me without even telling me and I want them back!\n\n**ME:** I can't do that I'm afraid. It's in the terms and conditions that points will expire after a certain amount of time and we do not offer refunds on any points that expire.\n\n**CUSTOMER:** That's besides the point. You've been stealing points from me for weeks and you won't give them back. I've had no warning on my account to tell me that my points have been expiring.\n\n**ME:** Well I'm sorry to hear that you are unhappy with my response, but as I stated, this is in the terms and conditions that you agreed to when registering on our website.\n\n**CUSTOMER:** That's bollocks. I wouldn't agree to anything so criminal. I'm going to write a complaint to trading standards about this, and I'm going to write to all the papers about your scam. Do *you* think it's okay to treat a customer like this?\n\n**ME:** *(taken aback by what the customer said and struggling to think of a response)* Well... erm.... you see...\n\n**CUSTOMER:** Excuse me?\n\n*(I continue to stutter, unable to answer the customer's question)*\n\n**CUSTOMER:** Are you British-born?\n\n**ME:** Yes, yes I am.\n\n**CUSTOMER:** Cause you can barely string two sentences together.\n\n*(By now, I'm shocked that the customer came out with such a racist outburst and I go silent. For the record, I'm a white-British guy.)*\n\n**CUSTOMER:** You're not helping me. I demand to speak to your manager!\n\n**ME:** Very well. Can I put you on hold and see if my manager's avai...\n\n**CUSTOMER:** NO, I WANT TO SPEAK TO HIM NOW!\n\n**ME:** As I said, I will see if my manager is available but I will need to put you on hold. Is that okay?\n\n**CUSTOMER:** FINE! I want to speak to him about how bad you are at your job.\n\n*(At that point, I put the customer on hold and got my TL, who calmly and politely explained the situation. She remains unhappy and tries to escalate further up the ladder, but my TL is the highest person available to speak to. In the end, she did get a postal address for head office, which we were generally not allowed to give out.)*\n\n____\n\nWhy didn't I call the customer out?\n\nI haven't been taught in my training how to deal with abusive callers. I didn't know until after I spoke to a Tier 2 that you could give the customer a warning for swearing at you or being verbally abusive, then disconnect the call the next time it happens",

She had previously setup an arrangement, had broken said arrangement, was denied service, then managed to convince a rep to restore her service on a promise to pay for today. It was pretty much the end of the line, and she was asking for more time. \n\nMe: \"I'm sorry Ma'am, but I'm afraid we have reached the limit of how far we can extend you.

        "text": "To start with, I work at a call center that revolves around providing non-emergency medical transportation, I normally handle reservations, but for one hour during the morning, I need to do some ride assist for the other states.\n\nSo about a few months ago I was just taking my regular ride assist calls and I receive this one call from Michigan.\n\nIt's a mother, angry because the ride for her son's appointment to have brain surgery done is not there yet.\n\nSo obviously I immediately turn on my empathy trying to let her talk it all through and try and calm her down while doing all I can to get this kid to his appointment.\n\nSo everything so far is ok, we find her a ride via a Lyft.\n\nSuddenly she is on the vehicle and she calls back yelling again that whoever set her up for the ride sent her to the wrong hospital and so of course I start working on it again, telling myself this kid needs his surgery asap and desperately needs this.\n\nBut then... Straight out of nowhere she goes and tells me this:\n\n\"How much do you earn? I am sure I make much more than you. I earn 50 an hour.\"\n\nYeah... I have empathy till you insult me directly, and more so, if you make 50 dollars the fucking hour, why is it you are trying to get Medicaid to take your son who needs brain surgery and can walk with no special needs to this appointment?\n\nIs it just to save a quick buck or something? If you make that much I am 100% sure you have your own vehicle.\n\nAfter that line, I literally lost any feelings I had regarding this matter.\n\nI grew a stern voice and told her:\n\n\"The insurance your son has is not one that we handle, this trip is made from the same system as us but you still need to contact the number I'm about to give you because even for ride assistance, the type of Medicaid your son has is not an insurance we even handle. Call them and they should be able to help you further with this issue.\"\n\nI was willing to extend the help the whole way, but in truth sending her to the other company that handled her son's insurance was the correct answer as it was. But to cause her less trouble I was handling it.\n\nNeedless to say she wanted a supervisor (Just note that she is completely screaming in anger at this point.).\n\nThe lead who took the call at the time saw how aggravated she was and was not in the mood for it considering she heard about the mother's job pay rate as well. She told her to call the other company, gave her the phone for the company that handled that insurance and disconnected the call before that woman could answer back with even more angry comments.\n\nNeedless to say; she called back and had the same action taken, before she (hopefully) gave up and just called the other company.\n\nLesson here is this:\n\nWe are CSRs.\n\nWe can be Psychologists at times and take your anger and help you through it while having a kind tone, but if you are going to call and insult us, who are hearing your problem directly. Be prepared to for passive retaliation.\n\nYou call me and you are angry, I'll hear you and go above &amp; beyond the line of duty to ensure your day gets better. But insult me and I'll do all I can in my power to ensure you have every bit of trouble meeting your goals.\n\nSide note: This happened long ago, and she did insult everyone she got a hold of in many more ways than just that. It's just to me the money comparison she made was the turning point of it all for me.\n\nOverall: I'm happy I'm about to leave this Healthcare call center. I'm going to a tech support call center which I am more happy about. Less angry people, callers have to have at least a certain degree of intelligence to be able to use the program I will do TS for, 20 minutes is the usual minimum talk time for a call (vs needing at most 5 1/2 minutes per call) and the leads actually sit in their desks and help unlike my current ones which just go around putting decorations and doing sales instead of assisting or being available to assist when we need them.\n\nUnless you really need the money. (Personal note) Please avoid Healthcare related call centers. The stress is just horrible.",

A collegue of mine gets a call from a lady that wanted clarification about some movie rentals on her bill.  \n\nOur company offers \"discreet billing\" so porn movies are listed on the bill as \"Movie rental\" but most movies are usually $5.99 or $7.99 for new arrivals.  Porn usually at $13.99 which triggered the Lady's curiosity.  \n\nThe lady calls and asks about it, my collegue avoids the details and simply says those are rentals during period X to Y.  \n\nL: I was away in Florida during that time.  My son was home sitting for us.  I know he might have rented movies but those are more expensive than usual and the titles are not listed.  I asked him about it but he just said they were new movies.\"  \n\nAt that point my collegue did not have a choice since the account is in her name if she asks he must give her the info.  \n\nL: \"I want to know which movies he rented.\"  \n\nMy collegue starts reading the titles and they were all hardcore gay movies.  The kind of titles that leave no doubt or leave nothing to the imagination.  The lady starts sobbing on the phone my collegue wishes he could crawl under a rock he does his best to console her but she keeps crying and eventually hangs up.  \n\nSo...yeah the young man probably did not think this would be how his coming out was going to happen.",

As you may or may not know, certain types of policies have a loan option where you can borrow a portion of your death benefit from the policy if you need it, and it goes against the policy as a loan and builds interest while the loan is open. \n\nSo this policyholder calls in, upset, because her loan had interest. The call was transferred to me as an escalated call. I'll be Me and the customer will be J for Jane Doe. \n\nImportant note: a caller will often change their tune when they get transferred and be very pleasant on the phone at first. \n\nMe: hi there, Ms. Jane Doe, my name is VeryStickyPastry, I'm a senior associate and your call has been transferred to me. I understand there is some confusion about your loan?\n\nJ: yes ma'am. The gentleman before you is saying I have to pay interest on this loan and I don't feel that I should have because no one ever told me. \n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that. I can certainly understand your frustration. Let me have a look at your loan form and see what we can do here. (Spoiler: nothing.)\nMe: well, Ms. J, I do have your loan request form here and I do see that you've  signed it, is that correct?\n\nJ: yes and my husband too. \n\nMe: yes I see his as well. Now, ms. J, here is the thing. The form does say on it that x% interest will be charged on an annual basis. Did you see that on the form?\n\nJ:  (short silence) well I didn't read it! \n\nMe: well ma'am, the thing is, you signed it. Your signature is an acknowledgement that you read and understand the terms of the loan. Because of this, I cannot waive your interest. \n\nJ: well no one reads the form! I should have been told over the phone!!\n\nMe: well according to the notes on your policy, the loan was explained, but even if the interest was not explained to you, and I apologize that it wasn't, we do send everything in writing because writing is legally binding and what we tell you over the phone is not. \n\nJ: rambling about how that's not fair and she shouldn't have to read the form\n\nMe: well ma'am it's also explained in your policy documents when you first took it out. Did you receive that?\n\nJ: yes I received it!\n\nMe: ... did you read it!\n\nJ: basically the same rambling from before. \n\nMe: I apologize ma'am, you signature does acknowledge--\n\nShe hung up on me.  \n\nThen she waited about 10 minutes and called back. Guess who's phone it rang to?\n\nThat time it was the same situation except she called me a stupid bitch before hanging up on me. ",

He said he was going to cardiology. Maybe just 10 minutes ago. \n\n[There are at least half a dozen cardiology clinics in this particular hospital] \n\nMe: Do you know which specialty within cardiology?\n\nPA: no but someone needs to talk to that patient and tell them not to cuss us out. That’s not okay. \n\nMe: I’m sorry that happened to you but I can’t do anything about it. You can call security but that’s not a clinic issue. If you don’t have any information other than the patient’s hair color it’s going to be very difficult to identify who it is. \n\nPA: Oh. Okay well... they still shouldn’t do that. You need to tell him that. [click]",

This morning! And they didn’t refill my medication!\n\nMe: I’m seeing that the refill is in process and the request has been sent to Dr. X. \n\nAP: That’s all you have to say?

        "text": "So I work on the email side of customer service at the call center and man I could tell you some stories. While I (thankfully) don't have to talk to many people over the phone about 70% of the customer service emails I get on a daily basis are pretty...bad. \n\nI've worked on the phone end, but emails are a special kind of venom. Someone telling you that you are a piece of crap over the phone is pretty not cool. Someone writing a novel about how you are a piece of crap and then having to write a very polite response back? An easy way to get your jimmies rustled, let me tell you.\n\nThe email I'm going to share with you isn't word for word the email that we received, but it's pretty dang close. We'll call the company I work for Generico Bland Food.\n\n\nEmail I Received:\n\nDear Customer Service, \n\nIt’s been a whole half hour! WHERE TF IS MY F-ing BLAND FOOD??????????? It only takes 20 mins to bake bland food not a half hour and it’s going to be burnt as hell! Seriously, I hate this! IT’S GOING TO BE OVERDONE AND I WILL NOT EAT IT ASSHOLE! I live less than 3 minutes away and this should have taken 10 minutes tops! How can you be this horrible??? This is why minimum wage exists.\n\nCustomer Serviced\n\n\nThis is pretty standard fare. And of course I wrote a very polite apology in return. But I mine is a very bitter and sarcastic soul. What I wanted to write was:\n\n\nHey Customer Serviced! \n\nThank you for your message! You seem to be having some misconceptions that I am more than happy to clear up! First, of all the misuses of punctuation in the english language, using too many question marks makes the absolute least sense. Are you trying to convey how confused you are? Because it reads as the literary equivalent of drooling like an idiot. \n\nSecond, I need you to take 20 minutes to get baked. Seriously, chill out. It's just bland food, and you not eating it is not our problem. I mean, we already have your money. The moment you entered your card information all of your complaints ceased to matter to us. \n\nFinally, the fact that you live 5 minutes away and waited for more than 30 minutes for a delivery speaks more to your ineptitude than ours. Put on your 5XL T-shirt, roll those cankles into some socks and sandals, trundle your ass down here and pick up your shit.   \n\nAlso, minimum wage actually exists to make sure your food isn’t prepared by legions of underpaid, overworked servants. You know, like back before the Civil War. But since you’re so okay with slave labor and keeping it classic, don’t be surprised if your product arrives with a touch more “special ingredient” than usual. Just like old times.  \n\nYou will eat what we send you and like it,\n\nCustomer Service\n\n\nI've got a folder of this shit just chilling on my computer. I sometimes come home from work and respond to emails the way I initially wanted to blow off some steam. If you want more I can definitely share more.",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI worked at a call center for 7 months. When I was let go, I cried but looking back, I was beginning to hate that job before I realized it so I look at it (the me getting let go) as a good thing. It was my first job at a call center and from what I've heard from my co-workers, the place I worked at was one of the better ones. Better guidelines on what we could and couldn't do, more resources so we could answer questions, competent supervisors, where to direct people if they got lost and much better guide lines when people got pissed. (if the cussed out out and/or wouldn't calm down, we could hang up on them as we couldn't do our jobs at that point and they were blocking queues... one thing I really liked!)\n\nI sometimes got some of the worse as I took french calls as well as English. We sold travel insurance across Canada. Now I don't have Quebec French (or Ontario or New Brunswick for that matter). So more often or not, I'd be asked where I was from, be told my french was weird or outright told that \"I don't speak French\" while we would be speaking in French. Occasionally, I'd have people refuse to talk to me because \"I don't speak Quebec French\" but whatever.\n\nThis one time, I had a Quebec guy call in and we had a nice time over the entire call. He asked where I was from, said that he lived there for a while and we laughed over how bad this one restaurant decor was but the food was awesome and he thought the people from that town were some of the nicest people he had ever met. In the end, he told me that my French was fantastic, that I gotta keep working at it and that my parents should be very proud of me for keeping it so strong. I outright told him that it was one of nicest things someone has ever told me.\n\nI usually have a somewhat bad opinion of Quebec people due to how I've been spoken to and treated when I was in school (I went to a French School, kindergarden to 12th) and from visiting Quebec but this guy reinforces my belief that they can't be all bad.\n\nHDS",

I can see it's zero at the moment, you said you need £2,000?\n\nC: well £2,000 would help but £2,500 is what I really need.\n\nMe: [system tells me he has missed loads of payments in the past, has a low credit score and generally doesn't have much money going through his account. As such it tells me he is eligible for zero overdraft. This is hard because people always think that i am personally making this decision and want to know why, and its tough trying to be nice while you say 'the decison is made by a system which monitors how you use the account, and you basically cannot be trusted with money, and here is a history of all of your mistakes which justify our decison'].\n\nMe: sorry sir, I've made the request and its came back declined. It does get reviewed monthly so you can try again next month.\n\nC: well, it may be worth speaking to a manager, I just won £500,000 on the lottery and if you give me this short temporary overdraft, I promise to keep my money with you. Your manager won't be happy if you turn me down. You should speak to them.\n\nMe: ok, let me place you on hold. [Hold customer. Wait at my desk patiently for 3 minutes]. Hi there sir thanks for waiting. Can I ask when you're due to get your winnings?\n\nC: next week, so it's really no loss to you guys, only 6 days then you'll be paid back and THEN some!\n\nMe: well sir, unfortunately your success hasn't changed the decision but you're welcome to reapply in 6 days and I'm sure the decision will be different by then. Anything else I can do to help today?\n\nC: remember my name for when you see me on the news next week. I'm going to phone 'bank #2', I'm sure they will have a different story.\n\n\n6 months later.

Its out responsibility to let you know when the price changes and it's your responsibility to read thru the bills. If you don't read the full bill, that isn't on us. \n\nCx: Well, it's doesn't matter.

About a year ago, I had this wonderfully sweet older lady on my line making a payment for her water bill. \n\nAs we were waiting on the payment to process, she had a rather interesting question for me: \"Do you know the name of the hold music?\" This question really shocked me because A) I've never been asked before and B) I didn't really think anybody CARED that much. So in my shock, I simply asked the lady, \"Why?\" She goes into this rant about how beautiful the music is and she said that it would sound really good for a funeral or sad moment. Since I appreciated her healthy curiosity, I placed her on hold to ask the leads if they knew the name of our hold music. They did not, but did suggest I ask a specific coworker in the IT/IVR department. \n\nI picked my customer back up and told her that I will find out the information for her and call her back. I was excited to have a project that wasn't inherently payment related, AND with management's support! So I hop onto our Skyle/Lync chat system and sent a really awkwardly worded message to the IVR/IT guy I was referred to, explaining what I needed. His reply was disappointing: he did not know either. BUT he offered to find out for me! I told him I'd be happy to help, if he needed it. \n\nThree Days Later\nI received a chat from Mr. IT Guy detailing the name of the mystery hold music. OPUS NUMBER 1! The Cisco-invented epic-ness of a song. :) I called my customer with the news and told her that it's even available on Youtube to listen at her leisure :) \n\nDoes your company use this hold music?

        "text": "So I work for a med-d drug plan call centre but I also do enrollment. I get a call from a Pharm tech advising me a lady (OL) called her and explained the situation before transferring her. \n\nOL had moved states and needed to be re- enrolled.  Because she's moving states,  she had a special enrollment period allowing her to still have coverage the next month,  instead of starting January 1st like AEP.\n\nOr so should have happened. \n\nThe person who had taken the enrollment ended up cancelling her coverage until 2018. OL was on inhalers,  insulin,  everything. And she just lost coverage for 2 months. \n\nI'm fuming and reach out to my senior dept to see what the hell I can do for November, since I can properly enrol her and have the coverage start December.  This call lasted an hour. \n\nMy senior rep is absolutely amazing (and angry at the prev. Rep who was ONLY enrollment trained and thus shouldnt have fucked up so badly) and does some voodoo magic allowing a 5day window in November so OL can get the meds she had gotten early October,  before the coverage was termed. Bless her.\n\n So now I'm back to OL and enroll her,  emphasising the date of coverage. Even put in the notes the confirmation number, date of effectiveness,  and everything that happened. \n\nSo to OL, I'm so sorry you lost a month of coverage. To my SR rep,  you're absolutely amazing.  To the enrollment rep, stop speeding through enrollments and pay attention. I'm tired of fixing your shit (This isnt the first incorrect enrollment I've fixed from this rep but I'm hoping it'll be the last)",

Why did I get this?\n\nMe- well you got it because you called in last week and added a PIN to your account. \n\nC- This is such bullshit. Why do I even need a code?\n\nMe- Well this is so that no one can call in pretending to be you and order phones on your behalf. \n\nC- Oh so this is to cover yourselves, not for my convenience \n\nMe- Umm no. This account is in your social and can rack up thousands of dollars in your name wouldn’t you want there to be some security behind it?\n\nC- All you want to do is make it as hard as possible for me, huh? \n\nMe- I don’t understand why you think that, but I respect your right to think it.

But it has its moments...\n\nI was on a campaign for a brand called Cherry Pie Wines (long time ago, we don’t call for them anymore).  They make an absolutely delicious collection of Pinot Noirs...but I’ll rant about that on another sub :P When we call out, we use a system that allows us to customize our caller ID to be the winery’s name - in this case the caller ID came up “Cherry Pie.” Not “Cherry Pie Wines”. Just “Cherry Pie.”\n\nIn this case, me will be ME and Suspicious Wife will be SW.\n\nSW: Hello?\n\nMe: Hi, this is -\n\nSW: Oh I know who you are, CHERRY PIE! Where did you get my husband’s number?!
