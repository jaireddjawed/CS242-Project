Although it never bothered me before now that I look at my self with another perspective and I am looking for a partner, this started bothering me a lot. Have anyone struggle with that? and how can I overcome this?",

        "text": "I have a lot of social skill challenges that I've created over the past few years for my students. \n\nWhat I like about these challenges is that you can dial up or dial down the challenge level based on where you're at socially.\n\nWondering if anyone would like to try challenges like the one below?\n\nIf this post gets any interest, I'll post more...just let me know in the comments!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Day 1: Go somewhere by yourself. Notice how no one is judging you.**\n\nüëâÔ∏è What to do:\n\nGo somewhere public by yourself today and just hang out for 20-30 minutes. \n\nNotice how people just go on about their day, and people generally don't pay much attention to you.\n\nüëâÔ∏è Why you're doing it:\n\nWith this challenge, we're combating the Spotlight Effect\n\nAt its core, the Spotlight Effect is responsible for making us feel like we‚Äôre being observed more than we actually are.\n\nIt‚Äôs the feeling you get that the people at the next table are talking about you, or that everyone is staring at you as you walk into a party.\n\n(Obviously, these things are possible, but they are much less likely than you think.)\n\nDon‚Äôt believe me? \n\nLet‚Äôs look at the science.\n\nIn 2000, researcher Tom Gilovich and his colleagues performed a study on the spotlight effect.\n\nThey had college students wear a Barry Manilow t-shirt (the horror!) to a social event and then recorded the percentage of people who noticed it.\n\nThe Manilow-clad students estimated that 50% of people would notice their shirt. This sounds pretty reasonable.\n\nBut the reality? Only 25% of people noticed their super embarrassing tribute tee.\n\nNow you may think, ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs Barry‚Äôs fault.‚Äù\n\nBut the experiment was repeated with several controls of both flattering and potentially embarrassing t-shirts.\n\nThe results were all the same:\n\nVery few people noticed what the subjects were wearing.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they were too worried about what they were wearing, who they knew at the party, if they had salsa breath, whether anyone noticed their new haircut, etc.\n\nIn short - they were too busy thinking about *themselves* to think about other people.\n\nIt all makes sense really - each of us is at the center of our own world.\n\nOf course we‚Äôre the hero of our own story. We just have to remember that this is true for everyone we meet.\n\nAs we become more social, it‚Äôs important to internalize that people are typically much too busy to notice or judge you. \n\nThis is great! When we realize that other people (no offense) don‚Äôt care about you, it makes it easier to be social!\n\nüî¥ **Does this challenge feel too hard?**\n\nGo to a grocery store and look around, notice how people aren't paying attention to you while you shop.\n\nüü¢ **Does this challenge feel too easy?**\n\nMake brief eye contact and smile at 1 person while out.",

        "text": "So we have a friend group where we just hang out have fun and talk but there's kinda a forming rift between two. The female friend hates the male friend because she hates being cut off when she's speaking and talked over, and she doesn't like people being persistent because she feels pressured and overwhelmed. The male friend is the cause of the discomfort because he has the tendency to talk over said female friend, and most of the time he doesn't notice he's doing something wrong because he cannot read social cues and is not sensitive of when he is meant to stop. The female friend is not vocal about her problem with him but vents out to the rest of the friend group when she is fed up. They have already had a discussion about this and the girl stated what she hated, and the boy apologized and and explained why he tends to act like that and that he did not mean to make her feel that way.\n\nThe thing is, the boy really is cutting her off a lot of times and by his background he didn't really get as much socialization as the normal person but he is pretty outgoing. Since the girl vents out to us, and I really understand her frustrations, I don't know how to act or how to judge and it's making me feel awkward when both of them are in the same space. Am I meant to pick sides? I can't really go the \"it's not my business, it's theirs\" route. It makes me feel uneasy about them both, especially when we have an outing planned where we were supposed to get together for several days (+sleepovers for the whole duration) but the girl became hesitant about going because the other guy will be there too.\n\nI don't really know if I'm meant to pick sides or what. I'm not used to this kind of situation.",

        "text": "I've never been the type to have many friends. The friends I've had in my lifetime have either used me, abused me or they've been friends of convenience (ie through work) and mostly superficial. I'm not hugely confident (although over time I've been able to feign confidence and social skills) and I'm a bit of an over-thinker/worrier. \n\nI'm 26 now and have started to really get my life together in some ways, and I've started to expand my friendships groups. I was feeling really down once I started to realise my current friendships were also kinda superficial, and felt like I was just never going to have anybody who cared about me. I decided to just go for a random meetup with a new group of people and some of us really hit it off. They were all different ages and from all walks of life. I watched the football with them and danced the night away. We kept in touch, and I started going out with them more and more. We all chat all the time, and meet up often, and we always end up having great conversations. I've never been one to go out to clubs or do new things with people because of my anxiety, but these people make me feel like I can move past that, and now I'm always out dancing or doing random things like rock climbing or going to the cinema or to music events. I started chilling with this guy from work and we have a great platonic friendship, I've just booked my first ever music festival with him and we've recently done an escape room and plan to go hiking, and visit his friends allotments for barbeques.\n\nKinda venting here\n\nThis is all super new to me. I have the time of my life whilst I'm out, but I suffer a great deal from anxiety once I'm back. I keep thinking that the other shoe is going to drop. I am always filled with dread, thinking something is going to go wrong. I fear that people are going to see through my mask, because a lot of the time I feel like I am putting on a mask and hiding my ineptness at social functions. A lot of my worry also comes from the fact that I've been getting a lot of interest from guys lately. I'm not really a romantic person and have absolutely no interest in starting up a romantic relationship with anyone, but I've noticed a few of the guys I've met seem into me, and I keep trying to alter my behaviour to try and put them off, but not so much that I'm not myself. I am used to my personality being too weird for people but it seems outside of work, people actually like my personality and who I am. I like being myself, but I don't like the interest I get sometimes. I'm out for a good time but not for romance. Everything just feels like it's getting a bit much.\n\nI'm sure it's just the over-thinking and anxiety that's causing my doubt, and without it I'd straight up be having a good time, but I'm terribly self-conscious and I think deep down I have a lot of issues I need to sort out with myself, and part of me worries that things are going to take a turn for the worse. Past experiences tell me that I'm not somebody who can sustain long-term, adult, fulfilling friendships but I keep telling myself past experiences do not dictate future ones. Perhaps, in time, I'll come to accept that good things can happen. But because of my tendency towards self-destruction and masking, I continue to expect the worst. I'm just not sure how to handle these new found friendships and the possibility that life might be getting better. It doesn't help much that I suffer with long-term depression and generalised anxiety which seems to be pretty consistent, with doubts that it'll go away any time soon. I've learned to live with it, and I feel I do it pretty well, but I'd like to believe that this is genuine progress and a glimpse into the future of a better, brighter life.",

Then, *during* the pandemic, when nearly everything went virtual/remote, I felt like it was easier to \"put myself out there\" in the comfort of my own home, and ended up joining. And it's been wonderful - it helped me feel like I was staying \"connected,\" and I met some awesome people I wouldn't have otherwise.\n\nSo it got me thinking - why not start an online group just for that? For people who might feel a little rusty with their social skills, or who could benefit (like I did) from finding a safe place to \"put ourselves out there\".\n\nLet me know if you'd be interested in this sort of thing - or what in particular might make it easier for you to take the leap and check it out :)",

Further dividing my energy into panicking about being alone for the rest of my life (no friends or partners) will just make it worse.\n\nI have to continue focusing even less on what others think and living the life I want. I'm not under any delusion that improving my situation, maturing, and learning more about myself entitles me to a better social life or partnership. I'm doing it for me. I want more tools in my toolbox as an adult.\n\nThe anxiety I've been feeling throughout this week has simply been a result of being 25, realizing that I'll be moving out perhaps permanently in a year or two (as someone who's lived in a religious family and been sheltered), and realizing that I can't use \"I don't have a stable well-paying job\" anymore as an excuse. Hell, the goal is to be making more by moving out since US programmer jobs pay well.\n\nSo in conclusion, I'm hereby for at least the next little while letting go of any my younger self's expectations of where I'd be at when I'm 30. I'll grow in my career, build-up routines and processes to better handle tough aspects of adulthood and moving out, and throughout the process, I won't shy away from social situations but I also know that when I'm living alone, I'll have no choice but to participate in communities and find ways to cope socially.",

I struggle with boundaries, in terms of attachment I am clearly anxious avoidant, and I do in fact have several legitimate mental health diagnoses, and may or may not be on the autism spectrum but because of where I get my treatment it‚Äôs not an option to even ask. \n\nSo yeah, basically I usually do OK with people superficially and just struggle to form close connections. However, with this one individual, I can‚Äôt even get a smile. Any attempt I ever make to engage her is instantly shut down. She won‚Äôt make eye contact, she exchanges zero pleasantries, she cards me every time (I have gray hair), and she is incredibly terse in issuing commands to me about payment. I don‚Äôt think she is just a sour person in general, because I have seen her shouting and laughing with other people there, I think her friends who just come to the store to hang out. On one occasion I got the impression that she might be upset at me for interrupting her social time to do business. But I wasn‚Äôt able to get anywhere with that. \n\nI understand that not everyone in the world Hass to be my friend, people don‚Äôt owe me their social attention etc. But this is a small town and someone that I see rather often who would be very difficult for me to altogether avoid. \n\nMy real worry is there is some  actual offense here that I somehow owe an apology for. Small town, again, and even if I don‚Äôt need to be friends with this person I definitely don‚Äôt need to be the center of rumors and accusations. In the back of my mind I can‚Äôt help but wonder if maybe she thought I was hitting on her the first time I met her and tried to be friendly. She is a relatively young woman and I am a middle-aged man; I could imagine that if she thought I was hitting on her she could find me to be a creep. But I definitely didn‚Äôt hit on her, I am pretty sure I behave the way I do with everyone which is to say hello and try to say something funny and I may or may not have even told her my name and that I‚Äôm new in town. That would‚Äôve been last summer, but I‚Äôve been going to the store more often lately as I am trying to get out of the habit of driving into the city so often. \n\nI guess I really just don‚Äôt know where to start with this one. She has not responded in any real way into any attempt I have made to start any kind of conversation. She basically just shuts up and looks away, and only engages in the absolute bare minimum required interaction, i.e. scanning my food and ID and telling me to push the credit card button. She doesn‚Äôt respond at all to things like how‚Äôs your day going, hello, thanks, see you next time, etc. \n\nAnd I really do think it‚Äôs just me, because she seems to interact normally with everybody else before and after me in the store. I can‚Äôt identify anything out of the ordinary about my own behavior relative to anyone else there, except again the fact that I‚Äôm relatively new to the town. It‚Äôs quite likely that everyone else I see her interact with she‚Äôs known for years. So do I just need to accept that I am a social nonentity until I‚Äôve been there for five or six years? Should I in fact make any effort at all to try to engage her, or just leave when I see that she‚Äôs there? She‚Äôs there basically all the time. So that‚Äôs kind of not a great option.  I honestly don‚Äôt know why introspectively this bothers me so much, but it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs this dark negative energy that descends upon me when I enter the space that she‚Äôs in. It makes me feel really unwelcome and more than a little uneasy.",

I'm open for book recommendations since i haven't search for some since there's too many out there and well videos and stuff, that consider the person not having friends and don't know how to talk at all, I'm not shy, if i knew how to talk to someone i would straight up do it, bc if i don't i stutter and have awkward silences. It would be easy if there was a book or video telling me exactly what to say,  bc is all just the same of say something funny, not that general they give some great advice but nothing comes out, ask about them, the people never talk about themselves or just give dry answers, oh and i didn't mention that i don't share interests with anyone, like idk military history, historic music, sociology, chemistry and biology.

        "text": "So I recently joined an online game group where people do jigsaw puzzles together. The way this game works, you need to bring an image from the internet to create the puzzle set. \n\nThere is this old man (probably in his late 30's and 40s)in the group and I noticed today that he brought an image of anime girls that are young and pretty. The picture had a couple of girls that exposed their skin on the upper breast area. The image wasn't outright sexual, but I still found it a little creepy that an old man brought that picture of his preference to play with others. It just reminded me of a predatory old man who likes young girls. \n\nAlthough I wasn't an established member of the group, I decided to bring the matter to the manager of the group first. (Which was a mistake) Cause we also belong to the other group where a similar issue got handled well...and so I expected a positive outcome, even tho the manager wasn't the same person in this game group. \n\nI was dead wrong. \n\nI told her that I feel a bit uncomforable about this man, and that I just reported the man's picture anyway even tho the pic isn't outright sexual (It's a function in the app) and that I messaged her privately so she's in the know... \n\nI wasn't entirely sure she's going to back me up or acknowledge the matter in the group, so this approach was my way of testing her. \n\nShe told me the pic won't be a problem the way she sees it, and that she feels confused about what I'm talking about. She said that I should've talked to the man first. (Why would I wanna talk to someone who's possibly a pervert?) She said it's a matter of preference and because the picture is not even outright sexual, she doesn't think she can talk to the man about it. And that I don't need to join the game session when the pic isn't my cup of tea. She also said he could be just innocently enjoying the pic...lol. It just reminds me of my toxic female parent that I cut off. \n\nIf it were someone else who shared the pic I wouldn't have the problem. But she kept taking it as a matter of preference. Is she acting dumb intentionally? \n\nI feel like she could've still talked to the man. Acknowledge that someone feels uncomfy by his sharing of his choice of pic. I would've done that if I were the manager. So what if the pic isn't outright sexual? \n\nWas my expectation not appropriate? I don't care if I was too sensitive or not. I felt uncomfortable, period. And that should be enough of the reason to acknowledge this in the group, am I wrong? Have I become too entitled? Is this not a healthy reaction? \n\nI don't even care about that man anymore, I just feel so bothered by the manager's response. She said she will make sure to say sth WHEN the pic is surely too much. \n\nThe problem is that other people who are all younger than this man in the group, accept and play with this old man in a quite innocent manner. \n\nI feel so alone and misunderstood. I don't think finding such a man creepy is an exceptionally abnormal reaction. Am I wrong? \n\nThe minute I realized the manager was set to misunderstand me I stopped talking to her and haven't responded to her \"confusion\". What should I do?",

Throughout my whole life I‚Äôve been bullied by everybody, including kids in school and my family who I‚Äôm completely estranged from now for that reason. All of this plus the divorce has caused me to lose any desire to socialize with anyone and not like anyone. Plus throughout my adult life I‚Äôve realized that having friends is most important in high school and college, but after that, adults go on to start families and become too busy to make new friends or hang out with existing friends anyway. This is why I lost all my friends. \n\n\nSo this has been my life the past couple years since the divorce. My job is work from home so I never have to see any coworkers. Because of my job I never leave my apartment during the week and only leave on weekends. Every weekend I travel somewhere different just me and myself, sometimes a local cabin in the woods, sometimes another continent, and that always brings me complete joy, this is a hobby I found and love. I hardly ever have a desire to socialize with anyone and if I do, I just do it here on Reddit, where there‚Äôs millions of people to talk to. It‚Äôs 2023, there‚Äôs no need to socialize with people in person anymore when there‚Äôs millions of ways to interact with millions of people online. That‚Äôs more than enough social interaction for me I feel. Especially because I have autism which makes it impossible for me to socially in person and make in person friends. I‚Äôm told that all humans need some kind of socialization, but I feel I‚Äôm that 1% that doesn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs people like that believe me",

I consider myself an extrovert, I love being around people and I consider human connection to be one of the biggest sources of fulfillment in life. But I am unable to do it. \n\nI have a large friend group. I go out often. But I never really speak. I just kind of sit there and match the facial expressions everyone else does. I feel so stupid but I cant think of literally anything to say. \n\nI have severe depression so that may be why. I try to keep up on current events and entertainment/culture stuff to try and have things to talk about but nothing ever feels right. Nothing feels worth saying. But I dont feel that way about other people's conversations- they always seem to be able to come up with worthwhile/entertaining conversation topics. But even when they get the conversation going, I only have a few things to add before we lapse back into silence.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this? Has anything helped?",

I don't have any  disorder. When I don't laugh, it's because I am just trying to focus on  homework or other important things. It's also usually because I am so  tired from not sleeping and I don't have the energy to laugh. It is also  because I don't follow movies, shows, and social media as they do.\n\nOne  time was in high school when I was sitting near my classmates at lunch  when one of them said a joke that everyone near him laughed at except  me. I was doing my homework, but he called me and repeated it. The joke  was something like, \"If my future daughter ever calls me daddy, I will  have sexual intercourse with her.\" I did not laugh because I did not  think it was not funny. I remember just blankly staring for a few  seconds, mumbling \"okay\", and going back to my homework.\n\nAnother  time was when I was doing my homework, and one of my classmates called  my name to point at some cartoon to say it was our teacher. It was just  so random. Again, I just blankly stared for a few seconds and went back  to my homework.\n\nYet another time  was when our teacher was not in class but still gave us some classwork. I  was sitting and doing it while most of the class was doing something  else. During this time, one of my classmates drew an ugly person on the  board and wrote my name next to it. The weird part was it looked nothing  like me. He drew some fat person with glasses. I am a skinny kid  without glasses. He called me to show it, and again I just blankly  stared for a few seconds and went back to my classwork.\n\nWhat  should I do next time? I think people are offended when I don't laugh  at their jokes. Is it my fault that I don't find something funny? Isn't  it the fault of people forcing jokes when I was trying to focus on  something else? It just feels so awkward when I don't laugh as expected.  Should I tell them a \"Good joke\" next time even if I don't laugh? Maybe  that helps avoid them from being offended. I don't enough how to do a  fake laugh. Thanks for any help.",

        "text": "Good day everyone\nI come from a small city (population of 15.000). Throughout my life, I was always your traditional \"nice guy\" : good grades, listened to my parents, no smoking or drugs, people used me alot, socially un-aware, shy guy, introvert... So yeah, I was never the hottest topic in my school, had a boring life, and everyone despised me, boys and girls, especially since most guys in my town don't care about studies or school. \nSpeaking if which, we only had one middle school, and one high school in our city, you can pretty much say most young people in my town already know who I am or at least have seen me exhibit nice guy behaviour.\n\nI just realized this now, but I'm afraid I'm too late, I'm 24 now, word is already out there in the city that I've been a simp, a chump, a \"he's a nice guy\". Whenever my name pops up,people would say \"Ah he's a nice guy\", \"he's so sweet\", \"I never saw him with a girl\", \"he would be good husband material\". \nI never wanted to be a jerk, but I took being nice real extreme, as in \"going out of my way to please people\" kind of nice guy. \n\nAnd not gonna lie guys, I absolutely hate the past me,... I was just \"too\" nice. Right now, I'm totally different, or you might say I'm being \"authentic\" about my desires. During the last two years I went to study in another town where nobody had an idea of who I am, and I had alot of success in that town with girls, since they had no idea about my past.\n\nI'm afraid the damage is deep, I don't feel like I fit in, girls in my old town already have that idea of me being a nice guy, and you know that's a bad thing because a) I'm not, b)a girl wouldn't show me her desire for intimacy or sex because she believes I'm only good to be a husband. Even worse, some girls unfollow me soon after following me on instagram, whenever a girl has an interest in me, she asks her friends about me and my past experiences  (you know how scary is the girls' network) and how boring I was. As soon as I start talking to a girl, you could pretty much tell she's wired. \n\nIs there a way to change my reputation and change people's perception of me? How hard is it gonna be? Of course I don't care about people's opinions, but I'm still human, I'd love to fit in more easily. What I want is for people to see the REAL me, not who I was. If then, they hate me for who I am, then that's fine by me.\n\nThanks everyone.",

        "text": "Hi. So I (16F) have always thought of myself as an \"observer\" in social settings. In groups, I enjoy just sitting back and listening to/watching other people interact (not for the whole time, but most of it). One on one, I really like learning from the other person, though I do get tired after a while in both situations.\n\nI never thought of myself as having a distinct personality, because when I am with other people I simply act how I would by myself.\n\nWhen I'm alone, I exist only in my brain... if that makes sense. I assume that everyone feels this way.  And in my brain, I feel entirely neutral. Simply a vessel for thoughts and observations, where no idea is ever concrete, only objective. If I ever have strong opinions/feelings towards other people, I recognise that they are limited because they are formed through my own narrow perspective. And suddenly I become detached from them. I'm peering at the Earth from space, an outsider looking in. Sometimes this makes me feel at peace, a lot of the time anxious because I don't know what is right. (if there is a term for all of this, I'd really like to know it).\n\nI used to believe that a person's personality was all that they were. To me, other people were like characters from movies and books, and you could describe them using a list of adjectives. But I could never seem to describe myself in the same way, so I figured that I must just be a really boring person, if not one of the \"shy\", \"quiet\" characters. It took me a while, but I realised that we are all the same in our level of consciousness, and that what we see of people is typically a small fraction of their actual lives.\n\nI eventually came to think of personality, or how we behave, as something we develop specifically for social reasons. Which seems really obvious now that I'm typing it.  \n\nYes, at times I feel like I would be happy to just \"experience\" for eternity, to complete my metamorphosis and become a sponge who lives to absorb the world.\n\nMy identifiers - my name, age and other things only become relevant to me when I'm around other people, to the point where those things are tied to a different me/person. Its very overwhelming to think that other people can *see* me and that my actions have an influence on their perception of me. So in social settings whenever I take the opportunity to speak or do something, there is a pressure on me. It usually ends up feeling awkward and unnatural, because I feel like I'm pretending to be what I'm not, *something,* even though I am nothing.\n\nI'm wondering if this is just a phase and a part of \"discovering my identity\" as a teenager. I'm in my final year of high school and was thinking of taking a gap year because I'm interested in travelling, and I think it would also help me learn about myself and determine whether I simply just haven't formed my personality yet.\n\n**To illustrate my \"personality\"/social self:**\n\nI am friends with a girl (17F), and we ‚Äúare complete opposites‚Äù, at least according to her. I actually think we have a lot in common in terms of ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and values. I guess what she meant was that there was a big difference in our personality/behaviour. She grew up a bit sheltered in the countryside, and is very outspoken about everything she feels, sees, hears etc. Every time we would meet up, which is not very often as she lives far away, she would find a way to bring up the fact that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúmajor‚Äù introvert whereas she was a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù extrovert. Whenever we would interact with others in groups or with her family, she would mention something about me being the ‚Äúquiet one‚Äù and her being the ‚Äúloud one‚Äù. \n\nI wondered why it bothered me so much, because it‚Äôs true, I do tend to be quiet because I get easily drained from social interaction and like to observe in group settings, and she tends to be very talkative and at the centre of things. I think it was a little jarring because I felt like I approached our friendship with an open mind, in fact I was the one to initiate it, but our differences seemed to be all she would focus on. I think it was also because when we met new people, I wasn't given an opportunity to be anything other than how she described me. \n\nAdditionally, it felt like she was constantly implying a different meaning of the words ‚Äúintrovert‚Äù and ‚Äúextrovert‚Äù. We tend to imagine introverts as shy/insecure/socially anxious. In reality, an introvert is simply a person who tends to feel drained after socialising (opposite for extroverts), and I guess for some people \"shy/insecure/socially anxious\" just happen to be a result of this.\n\nAt first, her mentioning this made me feel extremely guilty because I felt like I wasn't enough for her. I tried to change how I acted with her. I tried to make myself more enthusiastic and bubbly, but would end up feeling very tired by the end of the few days we spent together. Because of this, she would still end up reinforcing her perception of me in her head. Then eventually, I began to act exactly how she described me as. Quiet, shy, cynical. She would always feel the need to drag me into situations, even though my feet were already pointed in those directions, even though I never disliked them in the first place. She was the golden retriever, so I had to be the black cat. \n\n(there is a tiktok video that I feel really explains this and put into words exactly how I often feel about myself, I recommend watching his other videos: [https://www.tiktok.com/@austinambrozi/video/7176121627070123310](https://www.tiktok.com/@austinambrozi/video/7176121627070123310))\n\nOvertime I noticed that lots of people called me introverted (derogatory lol), shy or quiet, as if that is all that I would ever be. Their perception of my social self became my social self, a person I am now disconnected with. Having separated my true self a little from their perceptions, I feel like this was partially an excuse, a way to skip getting to know me or just to feel more comfortable in being able to describe me, rather than bothering to figure out otherwise. \n\nBut at some point I realised that I love to talk with people. While they drain my energy and make me feel hyper-aware of my reactions, I like social situations and big groups of people. All my life, people would describe me as shy and quiet, making me believe that I actually didn't enjoy these things. But unlike what the connotations of these words suggested, I never felt pitiable, only pitied.\n\nThat friend came to visit me for a couple of days, and on the day she was supposed to leave we spent the whole day out. That day, despite me having suggested our activities in the first place, I had felt her eyes constantly scanning, reading for my reactions. As I said, I had given into the introverted personality trope because it was less energy consuming, and stayed quiet at times when I felt exhausted. At these points I felt her trying to lighten the negative feelings she thought I had, even though I was having a really, really great time and was telling her so. No matter what I did, it was as if she believed I hated doing things with her because she already had beliefs that I hated being around people, and everything I did only reinforced this belief. \n\nAt the end, we were both very tired, but this was one thing that was on my mind at the time. We both agreed that we had a great time, and were in my room relaxing on my bed. I was hesitant to bring it up because I wasn't sure of whether it was the right time or how she'd react. I had gone quiet at that point, and she asked me if there was something bothering me, insisting that I tell her and \"blow out steam\". Normally I would have just brushed it off because the feelings weren't that strong, but I decided that we had developed past the point of a superficial friendship, and that I could share how she made me feel in a more casual manner. I explained to her that I couldn't always express myself to her because I felt boxed in by her perception of me, which is why I didn't seem to be having a good time even though I was. Hearing this, she broke down in sobs, saying \"you don't know how hard I try\", and that the whole time she had been \"compensating\" for my negative mood. She said that every time I looked away from her (which was really whenever I felt her trying to analyse my expressions), that I was suppressing anger or something else, when in reality I just felt uncomfortable with her constantly trying to perceive me. She said she was sorry that I felt like she \"disempowered\" me and preventing me from growing, and that she felt like all the experiences we had together had been \"devalued\" by what I just said, because I was \"just acting\" the whole time. \n\nI was shocked by her reaction, and my immediate thought was that I screwed up. But I was also confused, frustrated as to how she had gotten *that* from what I had told her. How she ignored the part where I said I had a great time, and wanted to be better for her (which I suspect is because she thought I was lying about it). How our experiences, which I enjoyed immensely every time I visited her but struggled to express to her satisfaction, had been so easily \"devalued\" in her eyes. I thought, if being friends with me was really that hard for her over the years of our friendship, why are we even here? So as she cried, I made no attempt to comfort her and shut myself off. I was regretting everything I had told her, all the while being frustrated that I regretted such a thing as expressing myself to a friend. \n\nA while ago I had asked her what she thought of me when we first met. She said she thought I \"needed a friend\". All this time my friend, whose bright, positive qualities had drawn me to initiate meet-ups and become closer to her, truly felt that it was her, the outgoing and fun one's, responsibility to help me, the shy and disadvantaged one, come out of her shell, when in reality it was her words that made me this way. All this time I felt like we were on the same level, but that was what she saw me as. \n\nSince then we have talked about it properly and reconciled, except now I feel inclined to show her an opposite side to me that is really transparent just so that I don't prove myself wrong by continuing to act in the same way. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI don't know if this was just a rant, but I guess my question is, why do I feel so withdrawn from my personality/how I behave around others? To the point where I would rather experience life as an invisible person than to be around people who don't understand me? Is it because the people who I feel don't understand me just choose to see me as the words shy, introverted etc because they are like how I used to be, and simply see others as characters with distinct, set personalities?\n\nDo I need to branch out to new situations to become less of a \"boring\" person and distance myself from people with limiting beliefs of me OR can I somehow change how people in my life currently see me to an image that is more true to myself, even though what I feel is true is \"nothing but a vessel\"?\n\nI'm sorry, this is long and confusing even to me but I really hope someone can relate to how I feel.",

In fewer cases we start talking (text) like normal humans and it‚Äôs great. We both respond in a day to a week. I rarely talk irl and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm spamming, but sometimes I end with like 5 paragraphs written on different days, and no response from Friend A for weeks. Or I get the one word reply.\n\nFriend B talks more but is on a site I rarely use. So partly my fault I guess I visit there about once a season. So when I respond I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm supposed to wait the 3 months usual cadence or longer? Everything takes months so I‚Äôm always worried if my last text maybe annoy or offend Friend B in any way.\n\nI usually don‚Äôt use questions since that feels like it‚Äôs compelling others to respond, instead of freely talking, but I‚Äôm not sure.

I prefer not to be seen as the annoying friend who spams too much.\n\nThese ‚Äúbetter friends‚Äù are the rare people who ever proactively talked to me.

        "text": " \n\nHey.  So I have all of the attributes I'd need to be the interesting,  mysterious guy who doesn't talk that much but is very interesting and able to make friends easily. So why am i not?\n\nMostly  i keep to myself as I'm introverted but when I'm around a group of people I usually stay in the background until there's something i want to say or i  think of a joke. I consider myself to be charming in some situations,  good looking, all that stuff.\n\nIf i  saw my life from the outside, yes, there'd be room for improvement, but  I'd consider my life as pretty interesting and adventurous.\n\nWhat  people don't realize is that my social skills aren't that good and I'm  usually pretty nervous, never knowing how to start a conversation or keep it going. It's not that I'm not self-confident, i carry myself  well, greet people with a smile, engage in the necessary smalltalk but  I'm just not confident in my social skills.\n\nSo,  is there a way to at least turn my silence into a good thing? Whenever  I'm at a social gathering i drift off after a few minutes, can't  concentrate on a conversation if there's more than one going on at the  same time and usually find myself sink into my thoughts alone. That  leads to people usually overseeing / ignoring me.\n\nHow  can i be the interesting, mysterious guy who others naturally seem to  take an interest in? I know they say \"to be interesting you need to show  interest in other people\" and i do, I'm genuinely interested in every  soul i meet. But i just don't know how to show an interest properly  because of my social skills so i never leave the small-talk-zone. Even  if I DO manage to ask them questions etc. it's a very one-sided  conversation. Any tips? (besides working on my social skills, i know i  gotta do that)\n\nTLDR: I'm a guy who  doesn't talk much but usually doesn't get seen. I want to become the  silent type of guy that attracts friends and others through his mystery.",

I didn't find it very rewarding in the end.\n\nSeveral people added me on discord but they never carry on the conversation when I messaged them or just never reply. I tried to arrange outings together and most of them didn't pan out either. They say they want to go out together, but won't give me their direct availability. The one person I befriended, keeps introducing me to their friends but I don't think any of them want to actually be friends with me. \n\nI tried to find common hobbies to do together as well, one of which is video games, but I don't think my acquaintances want to include me. Our tastes in games also differ greatly, but I am not picky and am willing to buy games I wouldn't normally but still feels like I am just wasting my time.\n\nHow could I improve my situation and get more direct communication from people?",

        "text": "I am a female in my late 30s. Really really sad in life right now. There have been such circumstances that I can never feel better about life. I have faced a lot of problems till now and have risen above them with confidence. I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 30. I finished my treatment and came out stronger. My husband divorced me after that because I refused to have my own kids (my cancer was genetic and hence it was a high risk if I had my own kids). The situation didn‚Äôt allow me to have my own kids. I was ready to adopt kids though as I have always loved kids. My family was against me getting the divorce because they also wanted me to have kids. My family imbibed on my mind that I won‚Äôt find any other person in my life. No one will accept a person who is cancer survivor and divorced as well. Only positive thing during that period was I had a good job and was independent. I moved to another city to stay alone.\nFew years later. I already have a boyfriend for almost 4 years (never married). He has been one of my really closest friend for past many years (long before my illness and divorce). He asked me to marry him. He was like i have no problem with whatever your problems were. He was even ready to adopt kids. Deep down, I knew he had always wanted kids. I told him he won‚Äôt be able to keep his word and it won‚Äôt work as no parents would allow him to do it. But he was really persistent about it. I kept convincing him for more than 6 months that he should move on and get married. That he shouldn‚Äôt upset his family over me.\nEventually, he stopped talking about marriage and all but we continued the relationship. My friends convinced me that I should give it a try and shouldn‚Äôt let this boy go because he seems genuine. So finally I decided to speak to him and ask him how he will handle his parents. But as soon as I started talking about this, he backed out. He said his parents will never allow all this and he can‚Äôt leave his parents for me. He also tried to justify saying he realised it wouldn‚Äôt work and that‚Äôs why he stopped talking about marriage to me. \nSlowly but steadily I was getting confident that whatever my parents said, there are people who will accept me for Me. But after he backed out, I felt really dejected. I am sure my parents were right. I know he was correct on his part and no one would have accepted their kid to marry me. So I dont have any hard feelings for him and I can also stay friends with him, if need be. Anyway, Its not that I have to have someone for me. But my confidence definitely felt that setback. I had been through mental issues after my divorce earlier. I was never interested in doing anything, was unable to get out of bed, used to cry for no reason. I consulted psychologist back then. Now I feel I am back to square one. I feel the same kind of depressed again.\nI am not looking for a solution or anything here. But I cant say all this to anyone. I just wanted to rant and I thought Reddit is the perfect place to do it as it will be anonymous.",
