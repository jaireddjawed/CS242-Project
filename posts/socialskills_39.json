        "text": "I’m gonna try to keep this as concise and readable as I can. Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nI’m a second-semester senior at a pretty prestigious college with a ton of great opportunities, and I have a decently solid job lined up for next year. The one problem is that I can honestly say I haven’t made a *single friend* in my nearly four years of being here, and overall my college experience has been less than positive to say the least.\n\nA bit of background about myself- I was a socially awkward kid growing up and it was always a constant struggle for me to “fit in” with my peers at school. I would often say and do various weird, uncalled for things that would drive kids away from me, and I would spend most of my free time at home on my computer/phone. My memories of middle school and high school are nothing but one big cringe compilation, and looking back on it makes me feel like I missed an important stage of development.\n\nFast forward to college and I was determined to repair the damage from high school and finally have a true social life like everyone else. But the issue was that I didn’t really know where to start. I lived in a pretty quiet dorm (not by my own choosing) and nobody on my floor knew each other or ever really interacted, so I didn’t have the first year “dorm experience” that everyone always hypes up. I tried joining a few clubs and I had a few acquaintances I’d see every week, but I was never able to make any true connections as my conversation skills were precisely zero. And most of my classes were in large, intimidating lecture halls and I had no clue how I was supposed to meet classmates when it seemed like everyone else already knew each other. Most of all, I was constantly anxious about acting “cringe” like I was in high school, and to this day it’s still tough for me to let my guard down in most social situations. My roommate and I were decently close my first year, but things happened between us my second semester of that year and I haven’t seen him since.\n\nThe rest of my college experience has been a mixture of pain and boredom. My entire life for the past 3 years has consisted of waking up, going to class, coming back to my apartment, and sitting in my room while everyone else (I assume) is out and about having fun. I tried joining a few more clubs all to no avail, and now that I’m a senior that ship has sailed. As I’ve progressed through college, it’s gotten harder and harder to make connections as everyone already has their friends by now and I can’t really break into any group.\n\nSo, as I close out my final year, is there any way for me to end college on a high note? And if not, how can I best prepare for the next stage in my life so this doesn’t happen again?",

I can talk to older ladies easier because I got so much experience with my mom and grandparents and their friends, but I struggle with younger women…even those around my age. It’s almost like I can’t understand the nonverbal cues. \n\nFor example, I can interview for jobs with men no problem, it almost always goes well when I have to interview with a man. Maybe I’m more straight to the point, I can’t tell. When it’s with women, I almost never get pushed forward even though the conversation seemed to go well on my end.\n\nI don’t particularly think of myself as someone who speaks masculine, but I can talk to guys really easily. Unfortunately I don’t have a lot of close female friends for this reason. Does anyone else have this experience? I am curious if this is widely experienced or all in my head.",

        "text": "Everyone says this to me. \"You have a heart of gold\", \"You're too good\", \"You're so well intentioned\". Even my own parents and brother say this to me.\n\nBut I'm literally trying to live my life and do what normal people do. It's like everyone else learned how to do things properly but I didn't. I am always the butt of the joke in my friend groups. I also have pretty bad anxiety. And before anyone says these are good traits to have, this has hurt me more than it has helped me in life. I have always been behind all my friends and peers. Whatever it ever was, social skills, professional career, etc. - everyone I knew was way ahead of the curve and seemed to understand just \"how to do life\" better. It also sometimes seems like I wear this on my sleeve, like people can just tell I'm easy prey.\n\nSocially, this has always hurt me. People always put me in the spot when it comes to doing favors, like I'm backed into a corner to say yes. When people joke with me, they do it because they don't think I can stand up for myself, and people tend to always double down. I have tried multiple ways to stand up for myself. One time I responded to a joke that someone made about me in a group chat and just took a jab at that person, but everyone else in the group chat was like \"dude, know your place\" - like I'm expected to take it because of the person I am. Another time, I just could not take the jokes anymore, and I ended up breaking someone's nose and basically ruined the entire weekend, because I didn't know how else to stand up for myself without violence. This also hurts me because I have had self confidence issues my whole life, and I remember EVERYTHING, and replay things in my head all the time.\n\nWhat is the key to people taking you more seriously? How do I put my foot down properly, whether it be for people I already know or people I meet moving forward. I don't wanna be a bad person, but I also hate being someone so well intentioned that all it ever does it causes me anxiety and make me a doormat for everyone.",

I was hanging out with my friends and I recently noticed an extremely toxic behavior from someone that i realized I, myself did. \n\nI noticed that my friend has a habit of literally saying a legitimate insult or callout then just saying \"just kidding\" after as a means\n\nexample: \n- telling a friend with obvious minor body dysmorphia he's a fatass in different ways (he doesn't even say it like a joke)(but just kidding)\n- accusing me of trying to steal his jackets when i forgot to give them back (just kidding)\n- generally just puts other people down for the butt of jokes\n\nI never realized this until recent and I was extremely annoyed at the thought of it. It feels like before I was dropped by my friend I was on autopilot and never noticed anything and just laughed at everything, and now im staring to be way more analytical of speech. Because when my friend use to call my other one a fatass I'd just laugh because I've been taught thats normal boy banter, but when i realized what he was saying, I didn't even break smiles. To give you an example of a \"joke\" of his:\n\nMe and my friends played a game where you have to collect falling pizzas on a pan that fall from the sky, my friend won the game and the other says \"of course you win a game about pizza fatass\" \n\ni was so angry noticing this, especially when he did this insult tactic to me. Then I came to the epiphany that I was like this with the friend that left me, I literally did the same thing, It almost felt like my brain thought of the first opinion, mean thing, callout, that would pop in my mind and I'd blurt it out then say \"just kidding\".\n\nI remember before leaving me she told me \"jokes can have some truth to them overtime\". but I think it's just that observing peoples jokes can tell you how they really feel/think about you.\n\nI remember before i was even 1% aware I had demeaning humor, when i first hungout with this close friend i either said her outfit was \"mid\" or \"aight\" then said just kidding after (yes i legitimately thought this was a FUNNY JOKE we could both laugh at). I explained this situation to a friend yesterday and they asked \"did you actually think that about her outfit though\" and I realized I was a perpatraor of this \"joke strategy\". \n\nThe close friend also explained to me i can be demeaning i DID and DIDNT realize how mean it was, i grew up in a mean environment so i honestly thought she was being sensitive but kinda understood, but after being more observing I can see why it got old and led to her unfriending me.\n\ni understand the idea of \"think before you speak\" but i always forget and it feels like my brains on autopilot and just says whatever.\n\nmy questions are:\n1. what is this called\n2. how do i stop doing this\n3. how do i deal with it if its coming from another person",

        "text": "Today is a tired day. I woke up early this morning to try to finish my task for my project, but didn’t manage to do so as I couldn’t stop my brain to think about all those negative stuffs 😔\nSoon at 9am, I needed to go to a class. I feel like my friends not talking much to me lately, and I feel very left out. Being physically with them doesn’t make me alone physically, but I can feel the loneliness. This week is such an emotional exhausting week.  Tears was in my eyes but I couldn’t let it fall down as I was still  in classes.\nAfter the supervisor’s meeting, I went my to my dorm, too tired to cook anything fancy so just went with instant noodles. \nI was looking forward to tonight dinner with another friend, so that I can finally relax myself and chill with that friend after a long week. While I was having my quick lunch, she sent a message saying she might be having dinner with her other friends, so dinner with me tonight is cancelled. I couldn’t hold back my tears at that time so I cried. \nI tried to stop myself from thinking about all those negative stuffs by forcing myself to continue working on my project. At night, I decided to hit the gym to release stress. Asking another friend whether she’s down to having supper or grab a drink together, but she wasn’t available. Asking another friend again and she’s not available as well.\n\nDidn’t manage to hang out with a single friend for this week. It’s tough going through all the stress by myself with no one physically available to talk to. Most of the time, I start doubting myself whether it’s my issue, why friends keep on leaving me. But I consulted other friends, they reassure me that I’m a good friends to them.\n\nYa, I guess I just need to find more friends that vibe with me then. That’s the end of my today story, thanks for reading~ and feel free to leave your thoughts and comments~\n\nRemember all these little unhappy accidents might come into our life once in a while, and maybe it’s just a phase! I believe things will get better eventually ✨✨",

I’ve noticed a trend on this sub where people come to ask for advice but then go into tangents explaining all the reasons why the world is wrong, people are unfair, and they don’t deserve to be treated the way they do. \n\nAs a person who once was also terrified of people and now has pretty decent social skills, I’d like to offer my advice to whoever this message speaks to. \n\nSometimes you’re the problem. I’m serious. People, in general, have a certain set of behaviors and they seldom deviate from it. You need to examine your own behaviors and evaluate why you’re getting the reactions that you’re getting. Nobody is coming to save you and no amount of pity will magically improve your interactions with humanity. If you don’t like the way you’re treated, if you don’t have any friends, or if you simply cannot hold a conversation that is a personal problem. \n\nMy intent isn’t to come off as rude, I’ve just noticed that a loooooot of these posts are centered around people complaining about how hard socializing is. Of course it’s hard. It’s a skill. Nobody wakes up one day being a pro athlete. They get there with practice. \n\nIt seems like a lot of people here can’t improve their social skills because they simply don’t understand how to improve themselves or change their behaviors. The first step to growth and learning is examining yourself and admitting your mistakes. It’s your responsibility to determine how you want to be treated and then act accordingly. Everyone else will follow suit. It’s up to YOU to change the way the world interacts with you because literally nobody else cares. The world is not going to adjust to your misery. Create your own reality.\n\nGood luck.",

This incident happened yesterday. My friend invited me to an event that gathering all the foreigners with different nationalities for language exchange. So, I agreed to attend and back to my home first for cleaning up myself due to whole day working and sweating. As I was on the train to the station, he texted me the fast food restaurant that he was at that moment, but he didn’t specify the exact location. So I take snapshot of the fast food restaurant that’s closest to station and sent to him so that I can know the exact location. However, he didn’t reply. So I assumed maybe this was the one he mentioned. As I got out from the train and rushed to the restaurant, I found he was not there. After a while, he replied and said this is wrong one, and he already left but didn’t tell where he went to. That moment, I was kinda pissed and just directly looked for the event location by myself with Google map and asking passengers in that area. As I reached the venue,  I found he was already there and chatted with a group of people. Then, I approached that group and started to have conversations with the groups, I found he was acting like he didn’t know who I am. Encountered with such response, ok fine, I chatted with other people. After 2 hours, he gave me eye expressions to leave. Ok, I followed him to leave the place. On the way back home, I accused him of being lack of consideration of others and expressed my upset the shitty way he ghosted people. However, he said he can’t text me because he was eating at that moment and being like no wrongdoings at all on him. I replied this is not the excuse that he didn’t tell the exact location for meet up and then left for happy event without informing. After that, I calmed myself down and not to talk about this anymore, then acting like usual way to talk with him. Am I being asshole for telling my anger over his action? This is not the first time I experienced this, he asked me out for dinner then didn’t tell me exact location and let me wandering around and guessing where it is, making me feel like a sucker. I know that I’m not a guy very good in such social events but I just hate the way I have to tolerate such shitty attitude to me and always try to please him without telling my inner feel. I know that he also faced many difficulties and unhappiness in job and study, I am also ok the way he made fun of me because of the stupid things I shared with , but at least being respectful to the friend that even spare private time to accompany him.",

Then one of my other coworkers asked if we got home safe in a group chat, and she didn't respond for a little while (like maybe 20 minutes) so I messaged her asking if she made it alright. I immediately regretted it but didn't unsend it. (which I now regret) She jokingly responded saying she was obviously fine since she lives like 500 feet away, and I said you never know so I just wanted to be sure and laughed it off.\n\nI feel extremely embarrassed by the whole situation.

So my team rarely interact with the other team because of this.\n\n\nThis one coworker is from the 2nd team. From time to time, when my team makes a joke and have small conversations, I noticed Bob stands up (since he sits across from us) and he tries to look over the computer monitors blocking him. He stands there and sometimes waddle (like needing to pee but i don't think that's it). Sometimes I notice he joins in on the conversation.

        "text": "Hey guys, as the title suggests, I have a lack of social understanding in certain situations.\n\nAs a kid, I would get bullied and mistreated and not realize it until after the fact. \n\nGirls would boss me around in elementary school and I didn’t know how to tell them to leave me alone and mind their own businesses since I interpreted it as them simply correcting me, albeit, in an annoying away and that I was wrong. I tried making friends and thought I had them but didn’t actually get the hint that they never wanted to hang out with me.\n\nOn my second day of middle school, this girl asked me out jokingly to humiliate me and I was weirded out and had no idea what she was planning so I genuinely asked , “is this harassment?” This was ensued with further bullying from other classmates. There was one girl in middle school who I thought was my friend and had no idea she was bullying me. I made stupid skits which I only sent to friends so I sent it to her; she forwarded it to all the kids in the neighborhood and I was the laughing stock. I had no idea it was her who did it but my parents helped me realize that she was the culprit. I then realized that other people who were friends with this “friend” that were bullying me were most likely recruited by her into doing so. How stupid of me not to realize 🤦🏽‍♂️. It was so obvious in hindsight she was a bully. Fortunately I cut contact before anything worse ensued. Same story, another girl was actually bullying me but I just thought she was simply being mean. Misreading the situation \n\nSo yeah with these stories of bullying and getting into friendships with toxicity I didn’t detect until after the fact, I just stopped socializing and isolated myself. I put up this “I’m cold, don’t bother me look.” I became “cynical and distrustful” or so I thought. I thought I learned from past mistakes and learned to suspect things but I didn’t.\n\nLast year, a driving instructor I had was not good at all. I made a small mistake and ignored a command he made because I was a little tense and he blasted out on me for a minor issue. He said that I’m too arrogant, that he’ll tell my dad, that he’ll quit teaching me blah blah blah…it was a small mistake and he was insulting me harshly but I doubted my confidence in my driving so much that I misinterpreted the situation as me being a bad student instead of confronting him. \n\nAnd recently, I made two online friends who both were creeps. One of them was actually stupid so I figured it out right away and blocked him but I fell for the other one. Fortunately I blocked him too but I should have realized in hindsight that he was always creepy. 🤮 \n\nAnd a classmate made a rude comment which I didn’t take as rude until a roommate I was chatting with pointed it out. And another roommate bossed me around a few times which I again didn’t realize.\n\nWhat’s even worse is that this is a vicious cycle. Due to my lack of social awareness, I have gotten into messy social situations in the past. Then I got distrustful and cynical and isolated myself later in life. \n\nThis created a pattern for me nowadays. I get me closed off to everyone , even the genuinely good ppl in my life. Then I feel bad and decide to be more trusting. But my lack of social awareness, potentially worsened due to loneliness, leads me again into a messy situation which again leaves me closed off from everyone.\n\nFortunately, I was able to get myself out of these situations before they got worse. But I’m not sure how much longer this luck will last.\n\nI’ve always been worried about this but having the misfortune of reading the Chris Chan saga made me even more concerned. Not only did this give me nightmares but it made me self-reflect, Now I live in an apartment, am job hunting, study in uni, go to the gym, eat healthy, have decent hygiene, am not homophobic or racist, and would NEVER do what he got arrested for. But I noticed how gullible they were which made them an easy target for trolls which unfortunately, I could slightly relate to, only that I’m not as naive.\n\nBut you get the point right? How do I improve my social understanding to avoid getting into trouble. What should I do to fix my problem?",

I’ve found in socializing that once I’m in an interaction I tend to at least hold my own in a conversation with other people and I tend to be effective when talking to men as well as women. My issue however is approaching people, particularly I have in my mind to “wait for the right moment” even though I’m aware often times there isn’t always such a thing. For reference I know well enough when not to approach, but anything short of that I second guess myself on talking to others. Call it anxiety, call it fear, or whatever you like but something is holding me back.\n\nI guess “Murphys Law” is my fear (anything that can go wrong will go wrong) putting myself in a space where it’s appropriate to mingle isn’t the issue, it’s having the kahunas to sometimes just talk to someone. After all we can be in the right place after the right time at every given moment. Those of you who thrive in bars, how do you do it? While just “doing it” counts as an answer I’d like to hear something deeper than that, for some of us it comes natural so we might not think twice about that ability, but it’s a gift. Fortunately I believe it’s something that can be learned:) Maybe one of you can enlighten me.\n\n(Well so much for keeping things short;))",

If I didn’t hear from my dad in a few days, it was fine and I understood he was busy. Same if my mom was dealing with one of my brother’s issues.\n\nBecause of this. I think I developed a tendency to not reach out to people. I incorrectly assume that if they like me, they’ll reach out, which isn’t always the case. And I feel like I push some people away bc I don’t reach out often. Like I’ll get someone’s number and never text them.\n\nBut on the flipside I don’t want to reach out because I feel like it’s intrusive (it isn’t) but that’s how my brain is wired.

It’s like everybody has this alpha complex and they have to prove their “dominance” over others even when the situation is uncalled for it. Being rude is not “cute” or “trendy” like some people think. I understand that there are multiple reasons to why some people may act like this (trauma, mental disabilities, etc.) and it’s a heavily nuanced topic that isn’t black or white, but sometimes I feel like a lot people go out of their way to be rude for little to no reason. I feel like common curtesy and being polite has just decreased so much!\n\nHas anyone else noticed this?

I feel stupid and left out. \n\nI don't understand how to socialise AT ALL. i hate myself a lot for being so damn socially awkward. I feel like it's my fault that i am not included in any groups. I don't know how to initiate a conversation, make myself present r be friends with them so they invite me to things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate myself so much for this, and get so upset and jealous a lot because of it. How do i cope? When i say i have no socialisation skills, i don't think it's an exaggeration. I don't ever know what to say to people, so it is my fault i don't have many friends.\n\nI get jealous and left out to see people socialise, as i wish i could do it. \n\nany advice? I have been like this my whole life so fear i wont even change.",

Problem is as much as I can carry on conversation after getting some information to work with, no matter how much I try I can never start anything, even saying Hello to a student coming in class can be hard. Not helping that I’m international student at English uni so while I understand perfectly, speaking is hell (obv for the lack of interactions with English people). My brain kind of shuts down because human interactions + second language = anxiety. And more complicated topics would probably end up with me looking for words for 5 min. So my question is, does anyone have some nice starters and follow ups so I’ll feel a bit more prepared ^ (excluding asking for a major and exchange destination, those are obvious ones). Or maybe something that would help me to calm down. Sometimes problem is that people are already in a group so I wonder how to deal with that. Any help much appreciated!",

        "text": "-WARNING, RANT.-\n\nOk, I have this friend, let's just call her \"M\" \n\nNow, M and I have been friends for about 3 years and we're in secondary school, however, our friendship is constantly on and off. She always randomly gets mad at me over something small and ignores me, pushes me, glares at me and shit for an entire week usually, before she'll decide that she's bored of being angry at me and suddenly switch up, becoming my best friend again. I hate her.\n\nFor example, one time she got mad at me for a week because, long story short, she and her other friend ran behind me whilst I was talking to someone, pushing me into that person and making us smash our heads together. It left a nasty bruise. So, you'd be thinking that M and her friend would be saying stuff like \"I'm so sorry for almost giving you a concussion\" but no, after pushing me into that other person, they gasped and laughed, so I went \"What the hell, guys? That fucking hurt.\" Like it REALLY hurt. My eyes were tearing up and shit, and I think my reaction was justified because my head was just smashed into another. Who wouldn't get upset? As I said this, I turned to the other person I had just smashed heads into to make sure she was alright. The other person had been hit pretty badly aswell. I turned back to M and her friend after speaking to the other person, but they were gone. They had walked off to their next lesson (this happened in school, btw)\n\n and since then, (this incident happened a few days ago) she has been mad at me, completely ignoring me, not even telling me what I did wrong, and laughing at me with her other \"cooler\" friends. She thinks I'm a joke. \n\nAnd, in contrast to that little story, one time when M was mad at me a month or two ago, she kept trying to push past me in the school corridors on purpose (she would literally go out of her way just so she could push me.) At one point, I snapped so I give her a nudge back. I go to my lesson and an hour later at lunch time, I find out from one of my other friends that M had gone out of her way to go to medical (in UK, its like a nurses office) AND to report me to the head of year for violence. Because of that, some teacher dragged me out of lesson to have a word with me. According to this teacher, M had said that I had \"punched her on the face\".. yeah.. in my mind, at the moment, I was just thinking how delusional M was. In the end, I ended up forgiving her after she randomly switched uo and acted friendly with her again. Sometimes it's better to just be on good terms with her even if I don't like her, rather then dealing with that drama.\n\nM is also extremely hard to be around. When I'm with her, I feel like I'm walking on egg shells. One wrong move, one wrong comment or joke and she's turning her back on me. I can't even be myself around her most the time. I noticed that with her other friends, she can have a bit of banter with them and call eachother offensive names as jokes, but if i even dared to that, well, she would probably murder me. M also tends to get mad at me for hanging out with my other friends, I know how toxic and controlling that is, but the drama of trying to fully end my friendship with her is too much to handle, plus, if I did cut ties with her, it would be hard to avoid her. She's literally in my friend group. \n\nM uses people, and throws them away when she's done with them. An example of this, is when M wanted to use our other friend's (lets call her L) summerhouse to have a sleepover and to invite all her friends. L said no, because it was winter and it would be too cold, and also her parents are super strict, so they won't allow it. M, who had been acting super nice to her the entire week leading up to this, had an entire personality swap when she found out she couldn't get what she wanted. And whenever M is mad at me, which at this point seems like a weekly occurance, she always starts talking to our other friends who she usually wouldn't talk to, like they're just there to be a replacement.  It makes me sick, and everyone in my friend group is wayyy to kind for their own good, so they all always fall for it, and never question how they're just being used for M's entertainment whilst her \"main\" friend is mad at her.\n\nM also likes to comment on my appearance and body. One time, I was walking with M and E (another friend) and M turns to E, and starts laughing, saying something along the lines of \"Oh, (my name) has like no boobs.\" I was 12. E, who is now one of my best friends, visibly gets uncomfortable but laughs it off. I laughed it off aswell, but ever since then, I've always been self conscious of the size of my chest. \nAnother time, M commented on my acne. I had just tried a new skin care product at the time, and broken out and was extremely embarassed and already feeling shitty about it. I walked into school, and I went inside the school building to find my friend group. I saw them, M was there and some other friends. \nM instantly looks at my skin and goes, whilst smiling, \"ew.. do you not wash your face?\"  M said this super loud, so almost everyone heard. My other friends all turned around  and looked at my skin. Them, being the actual nice friends reassured me that it wasn't that bad (ily guys) But M just kept on laughing. I was sad about that one for a while.\n\nHowever, when we're not fighting, she's genuinely fun to laugh with and joke around with. She does manage to make me laugh, and i manage to make her laugh. I think that's what's making it hard to stop being friends with her. Despite all of the bad stuff, we still have amazing memories together. \n\nSorry for the rant, I just really needed to get all this out. I have so much more to complain about her, but I don't want this post to be too long and boring to read.\n\nOk, so advice? Is she toxic, of just a bit of a control freak with a short temper? Should I ditch her, or just hold on?",

        "text": "I’m a 23M with ADHD and ASD, and I’m introverted to an insane degree, but I don’t want to keep it that way. \n\nI’ll already have 4-5 close friends whom I only speak to through social media nowadays, but I’ve wanted to expand for quite a while. \n\nThe thing is, I haven’t been sure what kind of friendship(s) I’ve wanted, so I’ve never put in the effort. But now I’ve decided that I would prefer to join some groups, whether through MeetUp, recreational sports leagues, or even classes that have regulars, frequent social settings such as bars and coffee shops, and even get a couple of part time jobs that involve a decent level of socialization, and use those opportunities to develop a wider network of casual friends or even acquaintances, just so I have a more consistent level of socializing, but at the same time don’t have to commit to deeper friendships, while still keeping the few close friendships I still have.\n\nIs this a good idea?",
