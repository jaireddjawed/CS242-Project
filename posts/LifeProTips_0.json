I decided that the damage was so minimal that I didn't need to get it repaired with insurance. My insurance, allstate, told me that I didn't need to do anything or file my own claim with them unless Allstate contacts me again for my statement (if progressive filed a claim against us). They said I didn't need to file a claim with allstate if I didn't want my rate to go up (accident was my fault). They said that there was a small chance that Uber wouldn't go through with the claim. \n\nBut I already gave progressive my statement 2 weeks ago and I haven't heard back from either one of the companies since then. Last time I checked with allstate, they said they didn't see any claim from their side 2 weeks ago. I'm not sure if Uber went through with the claim or if it's just taking a while. I'm probably going to call allstate tomorrow just to double check but as of now I haven't gotten any updates. \n\nHas anyone ever been in this situation before? Thanks to anyone that can help!",

In these cases, when treatment is futile or when treatment is declined by the owner, I will recommend immediate humane euthanasia. \n\nNot uncommonly, an owner will tell me that they want to bring this pet home to either be humanely euthanized at home by their vet or ‚Äúto die peacefully‚Äù on its own. Sometimes, they want to bring them home to have them humanely euthanized in the company of their entire family.\n\nI will recommend against bringing this pet home as this is only prolonging the suffering for which you have chosen to humanely euthanize your pet. Do NOT let your pet suffer any longer than necessary. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to humanely euthanize your pet. More than that, I don‚Äôt want your pet suffer for a longer period of time.\n\nIn this same light, if you elect for humane euthanasia of a suffering pet, be prepared to have this procedure performed ASAP. Waiting until the next morning when grandpa can also be there is an inappropriate prolongation of suffering. \n\nAlso, to add to a recent LPT, I agree that every owner should be present for their pet when the pet is being humanely euthanized. \n\nCall me a monster, but I don‚Äôt give owners the option. When an owner acts as though they want me to euthanize their pet alone, I tell them that they need to be there for their pet. If you own a pet you need to be there for them when they need you most. \n\nThe greatest tragedy in any veterinary hospital is when a pet dies looking for their owner.",

A regular urgent care is fine for strep throat, stitches, etc., but for joint stuff you want a specialist.  \n\nI took a family member to an orthopedic urgent care recently after they slammed their knee on the ground.  The orthopedic nurse practioner said the knee injury would be fine in a couple weeks but immediately noticed chronic pain on the xrays, described exactly what the person had been feeling, and prescribed physical therapy.  Six months earlier, the same thing happened.  I took them to a standard urgent care, the standard urgent care said it was fine and to ice it a couple weeks, and sent us home.  Despite this family member having chronic knee pain for 12+months.  \n\nI had an ankle injury, the urgent care said it was just a sprain and sent me home.  Now I'm getting ready to have surgery to repair a torn tendon.  \n\nAn orthopedic urgent care is worth the extra drive and hassle.",

        "text": "So I‚Äôve been living in my apartment for 2 years now, and I just got accepted into another apartment and I move in two weeks. The problem is I helped my downstairs neighbor throw away an old mattress (she‚Äôs elderly and lives alone), come to find out she has bed bugs and I just started noticing them in my furniture. Ive sprayed, used bombs, washed everything I‚Äôve had multiple times but they‚Äôre still here. I‚Äôve contacted my current landlord and asked for an exterminator but he says there‚Äôs nothing he can do. How can I get my landlord to get me an exterminator before I leave, or should I lie to my new landlord and say that I caught them from this new apartment and get them to get an exterminator?",
