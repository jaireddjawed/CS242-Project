So my question is: is there a structure present in the Spanish language that would account for the Spanish L1s I encounter overwhelmingly usIng \"Let me get that...\" as opposed to \"Can I/May I have the...\"? I'm more interested in the distinction between use of the/that, I have also wondered why they use the comparatively brusk \"Let me get\" as opposed to \"May I/Can I have,\" but I'm not as interested in that.\n\nEDIT: I should probably add that this phenomenon doesn't seem to be related to how well the person appears to know English, as it is demonstrated approximately equally across all skill levels as far as I've seen.",

I was called out for it, and when asked to pronounce the word, I re-unvoiced the dental fricative without thinking about it.  It wasn't until later that I noticed I was saying it like that, and after further thought I realized that I also do the same thing on occasion with \"thanks\".  However, most other words like \"thing\" and \"think\" are invariably /θ/, and some words have an invariable /ð/.\n\nIs this a notable dialectal thing, or am I just downright wrong?  Why do you think I would do this?  I'm a native English speaker who was born and is living in the Deep South of America.\n\nI'm looking at a list of unvoiced vs voiced th words to see what else I do this with, and I think I might occasionally voice: thousand, thermometer, wealthy, and bath.  I devoice only worthy as far as I can tell.  However, all of the above I pronounce either way, and I'm not sure what the preference is - except worthy, which sounds more correct with an unvoiced sound.",

All research I have done so far make it seem impossible to write a text of this length that is not almost exclusively based on other peoples work.E.g: It is impossible for me to make an argument that Old English long a changed to [ɔ:] solely on the spelling in these three texts. And all the observations i have made on my own regarding the spelling is also mentioned in the books.\n\nAny suggestions to how I can make it a somewhat independent work, and not only a repetition of the textbooks. Or should i change topic and go for syntax or morphology instead? My supervisor have not given me a useful answer and in this subject we have not been given any example essays etc. Thanks in advance for your answer.",

I want to become a forensic linguist, but I read on Quora that it's not really a job, so now I'm super concerned with things. Should I just become a prof at university? What if I don't want to do a bunch of research? :l\n\nPlease help and inspire me! I live in Canada, by the way.",

There is no ambiguity with intransitive verbs, so the unmarked form becomes the absolutive case.\n\nWhen a language develops a way to mark the object of a transitive verb, it becomes the accusative case. Again there is no possible ambiguity with an intransitive verb, so the unmarked form remains used and turns into the nominative case.\n\nYour thoughts?",

        "text": "Obligatory disclaimer: I'm not a linguist. This is based on personal experience, &amp; to a minimal degree about one particular piece of information a linguist friend shared with me.\n\nThis post is about how [ns] is realised in different languages, seeking analysis or information.\n\nWhat my linguist friend told me is that actually pronouncing [ns] can be very difficult. The timing of the release can be off, so if one makes a conscious effort of pronouncing the [n], then in casual speech the [ns] might turn into [nts]. I've had the chance to experience this IRL: a socio-linguistic meme has been around in Hungary for about a year now, where (elderly, right-wing) Hungarians deviate from the standard \"[migra:nʃ], &amp; say [migra:ntʃ] instead. (The word being migráns = migrant.) This pronunciation has a bunch of connotations, bottom line is that it's being ridiculed, &amp; it's not usual in educated speech. As a native speaker, I've been experimenting a lot with this word, &amp; others, &amp; I've come to the conclusion that the standard pronunciation is actually [migrã:s].\n\nHowever, this got me thinking, mostly  because I'm in the process of improving my German pronunciation. According this Wiktionary sound file, [the pronunciation of the German word ansonsten is approximately [anˈdzɔntstn̩]](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ansonsten), so the opposite is happening than in Hungarian.\n\nSo the question is: are there any studies on this topic? What do we know about the variance between the two solutions? Is one more wide-spread than the other? Are there any additional possibilities?",
