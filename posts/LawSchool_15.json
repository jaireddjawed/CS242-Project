I have some questions and things I'd like to get feedback on, any help is greatly appreciated! \n\n1. Is the following statement correct, or do you think I should just delete the following statement from my thesis entirely? \"Now in accordance with the American right to presumption of innocence, the term victim doesn’t necessarily imply guilt on behalf of the defendant, however, it is the official term for the main witness pressing charges.\" From my research it appears to be the term used, but I can't find an exact definition in any law dictionaries to 100% back this up. \n2. Is it accurate for me to refer to the prosecution or the public defender as the \"defendant's legal team\"? Writing out \"prosecution or public defender\" every single time seems to come off as  clunky. \n\nThank you so much! Again, any feedback is greatly appreciated.",

I wanted to share what I was told and what I feel was successful. \n\nEssentially, I barely passed two finals because I was involved in a car accident where I was hit twice mid finals season.\n\n1. Be Genuine.\n\nI wrote my appeal with a lot of emotion and made sure that I didn't come across as cold and uncaring. I used my full 3 page allowance in order to cram not only reasoning and evidence in but also *why* I wanted to stay at the school. I spoke about my love for studying the law and put a lot of appreciation into this. Additionally, I met with the committee to elaborate and answer questions for about 15 minutes. I came in ready to speak about what I could do to improve, but what I was told after the fact that had the most impact was my passion. I ended the meeting with telling the committee that I wasn't in law school becuase it was expected of me or i felt an obligation, but rather that I truly enjoyed what I was doing and wanted to be there. \\[I am a first gen URM KJD so the road here was tough, but I want to be the first professional in my family in a field I enjoy--and I think this is it--did not mention this;too sappy and seemed to be too try hard\\]. I'll admit I did cry a bit but also tried to negate that with saying I wasn't looking for sympathy. They said that it didn't matter if I wanted their sympathy but that they would much rather have passionate students than students just going through the motions. So, be genuine and be humble. \n\n2.  Be honest--Admit your faults and show growth.\n\nI did not do great 1L, but made huge improvements in 2L other than the classes where I was unproperly treated following my accident. In both my appeal and my meeting I was honest and said that I know I didn't start off strong but I recognized them and gave them a laundry list of things I changed to improve and how they actually showed improvement. I focused on my improvements more than my excuse--and this helped a ton in my favor as they said they saw I was improving and I was willing to change for the better.\n\n3. Give evidence.\n\nThis is KEY if you have an extreme circumstance. Don't claim something that can't be backed up, and if it can be THEN DO IT. Since my circumstance was a car accident I provided a letter from my doctor outlining treatment and visits as well as photos from my accident. I also had a faculty member that has been at the school practically forever and is notorious for not being the kindest to students write me a letter outlining my capabilities as seen in his class. I was told after the fact that this was a major tipping point as most students appealing do NOT provide a faculty letter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I was granted my appeal but it came with stipulations. Nothing too major, but I had to drop to part time this semester and attend workshops. This is a blessing in disguise for me, as I'm currently still treating about 7 herniated disks and a misaligned cervical spine (im not a doctor, but basically my neck is straight and my spine bubbles popped like boba), so now I get to free up the time to go to all my doc apptmts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo anyone going through this process now or in the future, remember to be agressive yet genuine in your appeal and if you ever need to talk feel free to PM me.",

And I'd have to move to the area near the school (NYC ugh). \n\nI'm wondering if it's too late for me unless I'm willing to be alone and childless forever (or left with no choice but to either through the expensive and gruesome process of adoption or the expensive and dangerous process of \"geriatric pregnancy\" IVF treatments or something) \n\nI know men also want to settle and have families too and live stable adult lives without being in constant debt or be able to work and study at the same time....but they aren't going to be as physically and mentally encumbered by things such as pregnancy, breast feeding, maternity leave, wage gaps, ...\n\nLike now that I've written it all out, it feels like it's too late for me. And I should just accept that I won't be able to get what I want in life without giving up something.",

You know, the soft skills that are gained from just working with people.  \n\nMany law students go straight from high school to college to law school to practicing without much office experience.  I know that summer jobs/clerkships are supposed to help with these skills, but, let's be honest, more often than not firms and courts are just happy to have cheap labor at their disposals. \n\nI am a practicing attorney.  The one thing that I wish I had \"training\" on was how to deal with asshole clients, or difficult opposing counsels.  Learning how to properly and professionally diffuse a tense, out of court situation was crucial for me.",

Post-graduation I believe I want to be in DC and in litigation. I plan on doing pre-OCI and probably spending next summer at a firm that is not one of these, but \n\nV10 NYC: Mainly transactional firm. Definitely punching up having an offer here. People have told me that it would be dumb to not accept this offer as it would set me up nicely going into OCI to have this firm on my resume. I also feel it would be odd not to accept, but I'm not sure it really makes much of a difference for what I do next summer. \n\nV70 DC: Government contracts, regulatory, and lit firm. The people were amazing. Compensation slightly below market, but I go to school in DC so would save money by staying in my apartment rather than moving to NYC for the summer. Opportunity to work at a firm client. \n\nV70 NYC: Tech and venture capital firm. Not a big NYC presence, but well known in its field in CA. Mainly transactional as well, but if I were to do transactional work I would want to do it in these areas. As I already said I want to go to a different firm 2L summer (or split), the scholarship is not that pressing. It is 10k 1L summer and the rest is contingent on coming back full time. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/112nwvl)",

        "text": "I am not in law school, nor do I know anything about the law, but recently something has happened in my school in canada, and I am wondering if there is something I can do about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically in my third semester of college in Canada, I have this instrumentation class where we mainly do labs and we have a couple of quizzes and our final exam. I had missed about 3 classes I believe, and each class we do about 1 lab, but I ended up missing 4 labs due to not showing up (because one class they ended up doing 2 labs) and I also missed another lab due to the teacher being upset that I had missed class and he had me do a lab by myself with no assistance, (and me being someone not great with instrumentation, and the equipment lab package being very different to what we actually had,) I ended up not being able to complete it. We actually had more weeks then labs, so I would have been able to complete them all one by one even with my missed days, but unfortunately, he had also missed 4 entire classes. I had also missed the exam (due to a personal family health issue), I had asked if he could make it available that same day just for a couple of minutes so I could at least get a mark better then a 0, but he said no (understandably), so with 2 weeks left of class, I showed up to class, and managed to do 2 labs under his supervision with a group. But, he had to leave suddenly half way through class. I had assumed that the last week of class would just be the exam and no class, so I ended up getting one of my classmates to help me with 2 very short labs that are basically the same with minor differences. So during the second last week of school, I had 6 labs ready to hand in (4 from the week before, and 2 from that week). During the last week, he sends out an email saying that he will not be in, but he will get another teacher to keep the class open so that the people who missed some labs are able to complete some, and he would come in later that day to pick up the lab packages for marking. So I went to class, and I ended up doing 2 more labs, and I handed in all of my labs that day. I needed 4 of those labs to be marked so I could pass. So I was anxiously waiting because I wanted to be able to pass the class, and a week later I get an email saying that I have cheated as it is impossible to complete 6 labs all in one week, so he marked 0 on all of the labs, including the ones he was present for and watched me complete. I had immediately emailed him back letting him know that he has it all wrong, and I actually had spent 2 whole classes of hard work doing all of them, and he didn't reply. So the following day, I had emailed him again letting him know that he was wrong and he shouldn't have given me a 0 for all of them, and he finally replied telling me that he had stated at the beginning of the semester that only one makeup lab will be accepted, which doesn't make sense, because the makeup lab was for reading week, but he allowed us to do more labs during the last class due to all of his absences. Also, a sidenote, in the course outline it doesn't say anywhere that we are only allowed 1 makeup lab, it only says that if they are not completed after the due date, they will be a 0, but there was never any due date on any of the labs at all. So, after explaining that I could only receive marks for 1 makeup lab, I replied telling him that 2 of those labs were on time, and 1 would be a makeup lab so he would have to give me the marks for those at least, to which he said it was too late and I had to speak with my student counciler.\n\nSo, after speaking with my student counciler, and sending her the emails and all of his posts about him being absent and letting us complete more labs during the last week of class, she told me she would send it to the dean for review, and if he decides that it is unfair, I will get my marks and I can start class again. But, there are 2 problems at the moment with that:\n\n1. Class has already started, in fact, we are almost a month and a half in, so even if he reviews my case and I get my marks back, I have to come back and pay for another semester to take the class that comes after that. and,\n2. He has been talking poorly about me, saying to the class that there was a kid last semester who cheated and tried to hand in all the assignments at once, saying that I failed, and since my course is pretty small, its pretty obvious who that person is. And so now it's making the other students think I failed and I cheated, which I don't like at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, my question is, is there any legal action I am able to take here? For dragging my name in the mud, or for accusing me of cheating? I have been very stressed about my situation because I was hoping to graduate this year and start finding a job or even a career path, but now I may have to stay and pay for a whole other semester just for this one class. I understand that I could have been smarter and been less lazy and just show up to all classes and stay on top of all that, but I also feel like it is quite unfair to fail me based of his hunch.\n\nSorry for the long paragraph, I am just very stressed and I would like some advice.",
