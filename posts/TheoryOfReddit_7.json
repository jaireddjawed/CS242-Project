Looking at the subreddit, there doesn't seem to be much correlation with which posts get to the FP and which ones are buried. I have even seen one post get buried, then someone else reposts it and it does well.\n\nThere's like 3 posts every minute. When your post is at the top of the new section, it will get upvotes fast, as people will just upvote everything. For example, a recent post of mine there got 6 upvotes in a minute. However, as soon as another post is submitted, your post is immediately ignored, and eventually buried.\n\nIs it mostly just a game of luck for this particular subreddit? Seeing upvote expert GallowBoob's recent /r/aww activity, it doesn't seem like even he knows many special tricks. Most of his submissions there get less than a couple hundred upvotes. He has had success there in the past, but it doesn't seem as solid as it is in the other subreddits, more that he just deletes his post and posts it again until it rises.\n\nIs it pretty much just 100% luck with /r/aww?",

        "text": "### Preface\n\nThe Teen Mom drama is no doubt the largest I've seen in reddit. And I've seen them all. I am a moderator of a circlejerk subreddit, I have participated in circlejerk subreddits, I've seen how nasty people get here. But this is really something else. \n\nThe teen mom drama [has been referenced in SRD](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/8u0j18/teen_mom_fans_attempt_to_abort_unwanted_mods/) before, but [this one is far more comprehensive](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tzu3n/since_metaposts_are_allowed_now_i_have_some/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=TeenMomOGandTeenMom2) and if you haven't really had a background on the drama, read these first.\n\n### The Blueberry Pie Perspective Edition‚Ñ¢\n\nThere's a lot of confusion about me. Who is /u/Blueberryroid? Is he Becca's brother? (No, I'm not) Why is he suddenly so involved? We'll answer that here.\n\nI didn't even know about Teen Mom (the TV series) till a day ago. I never participated in the subreddit ever. It started a year ago when one of the top moderators invited me to moderate the subreddit and add a few CSS touches. I'm a web developer, I write CSS for a living. So I added some CSS, then never went back to the subreddit for an entire year.\n\n[Then yesterday my name was summoned in a comment section](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tt1qc/announcement/e1ajyhq/):\n\n&gt;Who the hell is /u/blueberryroid\n and when did they get added as a mod? Transparency my ass.\n\nAnd just like that I've been looped into the Teen Mom drama.\n\n### The Art of Trolling\n\nTrolling is a delicate art. It is the art of making people feel confused and have extreme feelings against the things you have to say. This is not easy to achieve. People don't feel strongly against people who know aren't taking them seriously, and you'll see later I've fallen into this trap a few times. Yet I'd say this fun experiment was a success.\n\nThis situation is an excellent opportunity for trolling. We have an extremely passionate set of people at the Teen Mom subreddit that are already into some political drama. I'm still a moderator and god knows why (Becca probably thought I wouldn't do anything since I never did anyway).  With these two things, I had a chance to poke fun at a community that's taking themselves far too seriously.\n\n### The Plan\n\nPeople hate being told what to do. You tell them one thing, they'll do another. In the history of reddit, we've seen PR disasters with corporate community managers being shut down. \n\n[Just notice the EA community manager drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/). The wording is incredibly corporate and distant from the community. This became **the most downvoted comment** in the history of reddit.\n\n[Another great case study is the Ellen Pao drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cbo4m/we_apologize/csu2v63/) where Ellen tried to communicate in the most civil way she can, but the jerking was far too strong. She was removed from reddit. \n\nSo it's clear how to make people feel strongly against a moderator. Distant, corporate wording with lack of transparency and a lot of vagueness. This became my strategy.\n\n\n### The Sixteen ~~Point~~ Part Plan\n\nLet's begin with an analysis of [one of the most downvoted comments I've made](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tufwm/meta_overhaul/e1b6fh0/):\n\n&gt; Heather is our fantastic new moderator. She is part of the new moderation team that will execute [our new 16-part plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tt1qc/announcement/). Please do not be hostile to our great new moderators. Let's make them feel welcome in our warm and wholesome environment. \n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I feel like this subreddit has a bright future ahead of it, with tasteful new Teen Mom quality content that we all love. And an essential part of the vision of this future is with our best moderation team.\n\n* **16-part plan** \n * Was a ridiculous way of phrasing the new changes. \n * It's also a way of conveying the cold and disconnected message we're trying to get across.\n* **Please do not be hostile to our great new moderators. Let's make them feel welcome in our warm and wholesome environment.**\n * Note that this doesn't even address the reason why everyone is hostile towards Heather. It's these little things that really tick people off.\n * We're using the rule that people hate being told what to do. By telling people to be warm and welcoming, they become the exact opposite.\n* **And an essential part of the vision of this future is with our best moderation team.**\n * People despise the new moderation team. By calling them an essential vision of the future, we're invoking conflict.\n * The \"best\" bit was a Donald Trump reference of saying \"best\" too much.\n\n---\n\nI think I've gone so far [with one of my comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tufwm/meta_overhaul/e1b7btw/):\n\n&gt; &gt; wtf sub do you think this is\n&gt; \n&gt; A great new subreddit that rose from changes as detailed in our fantastic 16-part plan. We have the best new set of moderators carefully selected to make this community a better place. With your help, we can bring this subreddit to a bright, new future. \n\nI've replied too much. At some point, when you're replying the same things over and over, it feels like you're just parroting the same thing you've been saying like you've been saying like you have no real intention of resolving the conflict. And people have caught wind of this:\n\n&gt; [This is a joke right? No way this shit is serious.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tufwm/meta_overhaul/e1bmdj5/)\n\n&gt; [Your sarcasm is showing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tufwm/meta_overhaul/e1bc4i9/)\n\n&gt; [I‚Äôm sorry, you sound ridiculous and I can‚Äôt take you seriously.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tufwm/meta_overhaul/e1b7e00/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=TeenMomOGandTeenMom2)\n\nOops.\n\n---\n\nI'm surprised no one even called me out [on my EA copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tufwm/meta_overhaul/e1b6lv5/):\n\n&gt;**The intent is to provide subscribers a sense of freedom.** We don't want you to confuse less moderation with less intrusiveness. Our handcrafted set of new rules are designed to make this subreddit a better place and to set quality Teen Mom content forward. But make no mistake; Racism, off-topic, and doxxing are strictly prohibited and will be removed at first sight. And to execute our new strategy, we're bringing two new moderators, and they will be fantastic.\n\n&gt;**We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around Teen Mom here on Reddit.** Join us in our bright, new future.\n\nDirectly taken from [the most downvoted comment in reddit's history](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/):\n\n&gt;The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes.\n&gt;\n&gt; [...]\n&gt;\n&gt;We appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.\n\n---\n\n### Aftermath\n\n20 comments is enough to stir a community. I've left exactly 20, and no more. And to the success of the trolling, people really did feel strongly about the wholesome propaganda messages:\n\n&gt; But really, that's not even what brings me to this post. The claims of less moderation, transparency, and having our voices heard are actually great things if done properly. But then I woke up this morning and discovered u/Blueberryroid and their insanity.\n&gt;\n&gt;[...]\n&gt;Just in case of edits/removals, I went through and [made some screenshots and compiled things](https://imgur.com/a/aivbCUR). [...] sorry, I put off real-life responsibilities for this so I had to hurry.\n\nWow, someone put off *real life responsibilities* just for my comments.\n\n[**Source**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tzu3n/since_metaposts_are_allowed_now_i_have_some/)\n\n---\n\n&gt;Omg this blueberry mod is fucking ridiculous, sounds like trump, or a STAHM that runs a Facebook group. Derp.\n\n[**Source**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tzu3n/since_metaposts_are_allowed_now_i_have_some/e1bxvt8/)\n\n--- \n\n&gt;You don't even go here!!! You never participate or do any modding here. What bone do you have in this fight? I don't think its fair that a user who has never posted can just come in here claiming that they're gonna make it better. NEWSFLASH!! NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT\n\n[**Source**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tufwm/meta_overhaul/e1bakb2/?context=3)\n\n---\n\n&gt;Says a mod who has been a mod for a year and never participated until today. You are a whack job. All of you are. This hostile takeover isn‚Äôt going over to well and longname will become a dried up tumbleweed of a place.\n\n[**Source**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tufwm/meta_overhaul/e1b99ax/)\n\n---\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Right? I'm reading their responses and thinking \"is this person serious?\" I mean, surely they're joking?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Sadly I don‚Äôt think they are.

Maybe. But it *was* great entertainment:\n\n&gt;It's been a wild 24 hours.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;[Lmao I have never been a part of a community this dramatic and ridiculous and I was in the harry potter fandom in its heyday. Y'all keep me entertained](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tt1qc/announcement/e1a7uhm/)\n\n\nAnd we witnessed [the birth of a meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8u0oku/happy_return_of_meta_3/e1bqmcg/).\n\nSo good job /u/MillionBloodCapslets, [you called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenMomOGandTeenMom2/comments/8tzu3n/since_metaposts_are_allowed_now_i_have_some/e1bpnsy/):\n\n&gt;Lol.

What could be the cause of this recent increase in popularity? I don't know for certain, but here are a couple potential theories:\n\n* Maybe there has been a genuine shift in the type of person who frequents Reddit. This could be caused by the site's increasing popularity, or there could be some other factor. \n* Maybe the overall proportion of Redditors who frequent these subs hasn't changed, but they are splintering out into more subs. Is there an unusually large amount of overlap between the subscribers to these subs?\n* Maybe there has been a change to Reddit's algorithm for ranking posts that (unintentionally) favors the type of voting patterns that these subs tend to have. \n\nOr maybe it's something else entirely.

        "text": "Over the last few days I've been analyzing reddit comment data. I've been streaming every single comment, iterating over every word and making a tally of how often each word is used. \n\nI wrote a very simple and naive way to detect trending topics. My program keeps a historical tally, how often each word has been used since it started streaming data. It also looks at how often a word has been used recently (in the last 10 minutes). It compares the probability of a word being used recently to its historical probability and sends me a discord message if any term reaches a certain threshold. \n\nHere is a sample of its output. This is from overnight:\nhttps://imgur.com/mlsbAUG\n\nHere are more details that appear in the console. This is from a single 10 minute period:\nhttps://imgur.com/kbxEx50\n\nThe main thing I've learned so far is the Reddit is a *great* place to discuss sports! The primary thing getting past the threshold has been related to sports. This is most likely biased by the fact that the World Cup is currently underway, and the NBA draft was last night.\n\nI also think this is biased by my algorithm. A term like \"Trump\" would have a fairly high probability of use historically so the current probability ratio would be low compared to a sports player who almost never gets mentioned and then gets mentioned 200 times in a short period because he/she made a goal.\n\nIn fact, the only non-sporting related thing to break through in the last few days was some dramatic event that happened on RuPaul's Drag Race.\n\nI'm also convinced that the results might be influenced by the fact that I'm parsing comments and not something else, like post titles for example. I plan to do that too and see if it is better at getting more variety. I also will use the same algorithm on twitter posts to see what differences appear.\n\nJust wanted to share this with people who might be interested as well as ask for advice on algorithms to detect trending topics. This is all \"just for fun\" and for my own use. It would be great if I had something worth posting to r/DataIsBeautiful eventually.\n\n",

        "text": "r/conspiracy mods ban u/totesmessenger. \n\nEvident in the [mod log](https://snew.github.io/r/conspiracy/about/log) all the notifications of other subs linking to r/conspiracy comments are [autofiltered](https://linx.li/selif/w6ac59e8.png), also evident in the mod log is how commonly this occurs. It not only keeps r/conspiracy users from knowing when they are being \"innocently made fun of,\" but by who. \n\n\n\n[here's one from an r/conspiracy thread linking to an r/conspiracy thread haha](https://snew.github.io/r/conspiracy/comments/8aruel/ive_got_a_highly_disturbing_clip_to_bring_up_cant/dx5m0ts/) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; edit: wow realised just ceddit doesn't even catch these or [removeddit](https://removeddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8aruel/ive_got_a_highly_disturbing_clip_to_bring_up_cant/dx5m0ts/). Is there a way to search the logs if you're not a mod? \n\n\nObviously if r/conspriacy is the one being harassed  they shouldn't be the one's opting to take such  precautions. Idk how to explain this other than mods were tricked or their in on it. As in, on Top minds, or whoever else's side. \n\n\none sub that links often is r/betternews (other subs that seem [related](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyfact/comments/8ayng/one_year_ago_former_cia_analyst_ray_mcgovern/) and ping r/conspiracy regularly: r/conspiracyfact, r/conspiracyfacts, and r/topconspiracy) \n\n\nr/betternews Rules:\n\n&gt;1. Only approved users can submit links.\n\n&gt;2. Currently only /u/rotoreuters\nis allowed to submit links to this subreddit.\n\n&gt;3. /u/rotoreuters is a bot that automatically posts new stories from RSS feeds of selected news services.\n\n\nalll of u/rotoreuters links end in \"/?utm_source=ifttt\" which is a common looking referrer or whatever you call them. ?utm_source..... gets appended to the end of all Washington Post articles for instance (not implying this has anything to do with the Washington Post haha maybe though. \n\nutm is an analytics thing used to track marketing campaigns and shit. Fairly common. what about the \"ifttt\" \n\n\nWikipedia: [\"If This Then That, also known as IFTTT, is a free web-based service to create chains of simple conditional statements, called applets. An applet is triggered by changes that occur within other web services such as Gmail, Facebook, Telegram, Instagram, or Pinterest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFTTT)\n\n\n[here's another a shitty article about it from a website ive never heard of](https://marketingartfully.com/2015/10/16/ifttt-how-to-set-up-if-this-then-that-for-marketing/)\n\n\nsearch the \"/?utm_source=ifttt\" string with quotes and, naturally, you find  a number of pages stacked with links (all leading to reddit) that are appended using the same \n\nIt's mostly nothing but a bunch of horse shit. [a girl named lily colins pinterest, or one dedicated to her maybe](https://www.pinterest.dk/pin/376683956320212256/) if you [look at the source (right click and press view source) and search for ifttt, there's only 6 instances but they're all the same link:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gentlemanboners/comments/5id5ix/lily_collins/?utm_source=ifttt\n\nposted by u/u/PM_ME_UR_BOOBS_CUTIE who despite the outrageuouslyy high karma count and post frequency appears to be a regular person....\n\n\nsearch that gentlemanboners link in quotes and it shows up in a bunch of other pintetest pages. i have never used pinterest before and have now idea how it works though\n\n\nAnd then you've got reddit twitters like  [@SoccerRedditXI](https://twitter.com/SoccerRedditXI) where every links post goes to r/soccer and ends in ifttt there's more twitters like that.\n\nThis could obviously be way over my head but I don't understand how anyone could be getting paid, or paying to do this.\n\nwould r/soccer pay people to bring in users? or vice versa maybe? Or it could be an SEO thing but for what purposee?\n\nhttps://daslikes.wordpress.com/\n\n I noticed this user, [peterdollarbill](https://www.reddit.com/user/peterdollarbill/overview/) had a [removed comment](https://www.removeddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8azhai/simeone_impact_the_26_madrid_derbies_since_he/) from one of the reddit posts linked from twitter.\n\nHe's been a member since april 9, same day he made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Earwolf/comments/8avp1z/low_five_episode_540_of_comedy_bang_bang_jon_hamm/) on some podcast sub, racked up 240 points, commented a few more times in r/soccer, (once on the 10th) \n\n\nI'm not sure if the removed comment is related at all or not but what I'm getting at here is u/peterdollarbill is a shill in-vitro. \n\n\nSomeone is using ifttt to streamline this process for sure. I think the r/conspiracy mods are in on it, or at least most of them. idk what to say about the 2 oldest. idk much about the history of that sub tbh. But It seems like a good reason to keep u/totesmessenger from coming around telling us these sites are pinging. \n\n\nit's comon knowledge that sports and fap subs are popular dishillaries, because the users are generous with the upvotes. So it'sinteresting that we'd find one utm code ending in ifttt of al things linking to these subs precisely. i don't have the attentionspan to start looking at every userprofile in each of these links though\n\n\nr/topconspiracy and the other 2 i mentioned dont have anything appended on their links, or at least not most of them. bu like r/betternews, they all llink mainly to places like r/news, r/worldnews, and r/conspiracy.  so maybe r/betternews was an oversight, or something else completely unrelated to what I'm talking about. It seems like they get too many posts to be pointing people in any particular direction (unless they are directing a very large group)  but i think i think those subs are being used somehow, as a way to command the sockpuppets.\n\nmods need  to unblock u/totesmessenger bot\n\nAlso mods remove [posts like this](https://snew.github.io/r/conspiracy/comments/8aruel/ive_got_a_highly_disturbing_clip_to_bring_up_cant/dx5m0ts/) and I' starting to wonder if they aren't just doing it to fuck with OP, like \"omg r/conspiracy won't even let me post this,\" or just to be assholes.  But there no reason not to allow that post.   &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Edit: just noticed the pizza references in there. haha topminds can [bully users to the breaking point](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8287bk/polkadotgirl_farewell_i_was_bullied_online_into/), meanwhile r/conspiracy users can't say the word pizza for fucks sake.",

        "text": "u/PoppinKREAM is an active user on r/politics and r/worldnews\nThe user posts elaborate comments that connect facts piece-by-piece, citing sources for each axiom along the way. Comments usually have 5-15 cited sources that are summarized by a couple main points.\nBy doing such the user is effectively giving us a glimpse of a post-modern-era of how information could be delivered to the public in a decentralized manor. Getting information from only one source can be very problematic and critiques to such are limited if any.  But by citing so many sources the user is setting a new ethical standard of how factual information should be compiled and is raising the bar of journalism integrity that would be impossible without Reddit. The facts are threaded well together they complete a solid complete narrative. Without having to worry about the advertisers that fund the journalism industry or different higher-ups with conflicts of interest, the user is unrestricted, yet still can be held accountable by the Reddit community. They are left accountable through discourse and dialogue. \n\nAs many may critique, the upvote/downvote system is constrained by the minds that follow each subreddit i.e. 'circle-jerking'; however limited, the purpose of the system is valid: that comments based on quality will be highest ranked. Which this user's posts almost always find there way up the ranks for there quality content that is submitted.\n\nWhich gets to my final point: u/PoppinKREAM is conducting an extremely vital **public service** that is critical in ending such *information wars*. This *information wars*, the bickering back and forth with few creditable sources, has polluted the current state of the internet and exhausted peoples' critical thinking to a point that leaves them feeling overwhelmed and unable to be relevant in the conversation.\nu/PoppinKREAM's comments are elaborate and informative, yet simple and concise.\n **The high quality content is a breath of fresh air for any person attempting to be an informed citizen in our current online society.** \n\nI am curious of others opinions' on the user and subject, and interested to see where this discussion leads. \nDoes this user inspire and change the integrity of the community on Reddit making it a better place? I think so. And i think the importance need-be highlighted. ",

        "text": "I can see how me using \"him\" in the title makes it seem like I am only talking about men. But it can be whomever.\n\n-----------------------\n\nThis is something I have noticed a lot on Reddit. It makes sense that it is not used that often on social sites as Facebook or Youtube where it's hard to search through the comment history of a user. But it seems to be a well known and semi-popular attack strategy on Reddit and Twitter.\n\nThe internet rule might be described this way: *\"Any weird comment the other user made in the past can be used against him to make everything he says now seem ignorant and foolish\"*.\n\nUserA made a racist joke 3 years ago? UserB who is losing an argument, or disagrees with some point UserA just made, might just bring up the joke and post it without the context of the thread it was originally posted in. \n\nUserA says he thinks a certain celebrity or politician is a bad person? UserB might find out that UserA just once, one year ago, posted a neutral comment in a certain notorious political sub and call UserA a \"political extremist\".\n\nIt's something I see happen on Reddit pretty regularly in subs made for discussions but it seems like most people see it as a fair tactic to use in a discussion or idea sharing exercise on Reddit. To me it just seems like a really negative way to discuss a topic because UserA would want to at least defend his old comment first before continuing the discussion. Which will give UserB the excuse to abandon the current discussion topic he is losing, or just does not want to be discussed, and make the discussion all about UserA's negative comment history. You can derail a lot of fair and balanced points with this tactic.\n\nAlso, this is not always a \"fair\" strategy because people grow and change their opinions so the old comment might not be what UserA thinks today. UserA might just have learned something new since that comment. It also can only be used against users who don't delete their comment history. So because they are being open and transparent they are punished harder than users with exactly the same opinions but who do delete their comment history. This could make more people delete their comment history. Which would make Reddit a worse place as old threads often will have holes in them.\n\n\nFor me at least it's a problem because I see it too often on Reddit and I feel like this way to discuss a topic nearly always derails it. So I don't see why we as a forum community should blindly accept that this is a valid way to reply to a point one does not agree with. But then again, I have only brought up counter-points so far. Maybe some other person has seen this being used successfully to dispute a point? I do see how it's very useful to counter the Russian trolls that are only here to spread false propaganda. Their former lies should be taken into account when one reads their new comments. If you never look at their comment history then you cannot discover that they are trolls and that their current argument might be purposefully misleading.",

In this thread, I hope we can lay down some community-generated hypotheses about how comment-removal-notification strategies impact behavior on reddit.\n\nIn a later part, either a few weeks or months from now, I will post some data I've been collecting about comments that get removed. Following that, we can narrow the focus to specific metrics.\n\n**II. How comment removals work**\n\nA lot of redditors do not know a comment can be removed without the user knowing. The comment still shows up while logged in, so a user has to dig to discover a removed comment unless a moderator has notified the user about its removal.\n\n**III. How subs typically handle it**\n\nOften, a subreddit's moderators will let both the user and community know of the removal via a comment reply. In other groups, removals without notification are frequent.\n\n**IV. Questions**\n\n1. What effect does removing comments without notifying the user have on communities?\n1. Would it be beneficial or harmful to automatically notify users of removals? Does it depend on the subreddit? Please explain.\n1. Do you moderate anywhere?\n1. Assuming anything is possible, what metrics would we want to track in user or community-level behavior when (a) users are not notified of removed comments, vs. (b) when they are notified, in order to determine if notification is beneficial or not?\n\nThese questions are directed at reddit users and moderators, not the admins, per this sub's rules.\n\n/u/yeoldeuser, /u/virtueavatar, /u/ShiningDraco, any thoughts? I saw you made some thoughtful comments in a recent thread about mod actions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/8nohpd/i_feel_like_locked_threads_are_only_10_of_the/).\n\nTo be notified of future posts on this subject, write a reply to this post that begins with `Subscribe`.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "I've been a Reddit user for a few years now, but I just recently started participating in a smaller subreddit with less than 50 users online at a given time.\n\nI noticed that it's different from the bigger subreddits, for the better in many ways. \"Wrong\" opinions don't get downvoted. Karma for comments never really go above 10 or so. Since there's so many less eyes on the comments - since the stakes are so much lower - people care less about saying something funny/witty/trolly/radical/offensive to garner reaction, and more about communicating to the person who made the post/the previous comment.\nI actually enjoy looking at replies because I don't have to worry about whether someone stupid said something stupid.\n\nAnd yeah, that's nice and all, and people have made the observation ever since the beginning, that once forums start become popular they attract more trolls, and that smaller subreddits are nicer than bigger ones and that they progressively get worse the more people they attract.\n\nBut the thing is, having the experience of participating in a smaller subreddit is changing my attitude towards how I participate in the bigger ones. I feel overall less inclined to troll. I explain this by: humans are habit-forming organisms, and if you start acting nice in one situation, you start acting nice in similar situations out of habit. Through participating in smaller subreddits, I can feel myself becoming a better reddit person. Besides, it's a nice place to step away from the ubiquitous negativity of some bigger subreddits and reengage with the nicer sides of Reddit.\n\nWhich lead to my thought - wouldn't it be nice if every user could participate in such a small subreddit? Or if every user...was required to?\n\nNow, of course, this is probably one of those things that sound kind of nice in theory but could go horribly wrong in practice. That's why it's a crack theory. I don't think Reddit ever would implement such a thing. But let's still explore how such a system would be implemented.\n\nThe first problem is that not everyone has an interest that is shared by so few people. Most people don't. There are very few small interests that aren't obscure to the point of meaninglessness.\n\nSo okay, these small subreddits won't be natural subreddits, but artificial ones. At this point I toyed with the idea of creating 1 million arbitrary Reddit zodiacs, but realized this was stupid. Random hashing would be better. Perhaps they would be reshuffled once a year, so that small-group politics doesn't become an issue/so that you don't have to put up with the one guy you don't like for long.\n\nI have no idea what each small subreddit would discuss about. It would be incredibly awkward.\n\nPossible complications:\n\n- People with multiple accounts. This should be fine, as long as they stay active in each small subreddit for every account. Anyways, this prevents low-effort throwaway accounts.\n\n- Bots. Perhaps there would be a separate account type for bots, without the active small subreddit participation requirement. They would, naturally, have less rights \\*gasp!\\*, such as upvoting/downvoting. Bots must be created by and belong to a certain user, to prevent non-users from impersonating bots. Not sure about bots impersonating users though. I guess bots can be users if they pass the Turing test.\n\n- Russian troll accounts. Uhhhhh idk loooool\n\n- This is an awful idea.
