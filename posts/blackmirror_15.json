The only preface I gave was this is the only episode with a happy ending. He is a high stress type of person, and has had a long week at work. He asked me \"Is it heavy? I don't wanna do heavy tonight\"\n\n\"Uhhhhh, yeah, but in a good way, just believe me\" So we sat down for his first viewing and my 6th.\n\nAbout 10 minutes in he made a comment that he liked the acting, which warmed my heart, because I have heard others say differently.\n\nAt the end of the show, he was floored, while I did a decent job choking back tears (Belinda Carlisle is too much for me every time)\n\nHe bombarded me with questions, and said \"Who writes this shit!?\" And he was blown away when I told him about Brooker. \n\nAnyways just wanted to share a great night with my pops. Safe to say we have another convert.",

The level of perfection in every episode is unreal. They are so relatable and meaningful. They portray the underlying messages so beautifully. I'm in absolute love.

        "text": "Since we are debating this, I tried as best as I could to rate 'em all and I followed a couple rules: characters that think they have some moral justification for what they are doing lose Evil Points, characters that do stuff which is socially accepted by the society they live in too lose Evil Points. Finally, characters who only hurt cookies and not human beings lose Evil Points since we can give them the benefit of the doubt of cookies not being sentient.\n\nThe cheating wives from TEHOY and White Christmas do not fall in this rating, since their \"crime\" is too petty to fall in the same category of Mr. Ikillfourhundredthousandpeoplebecausef\\*ckyouthatswhy and Mr. Isetupamuseumwherepeoplecanelectrocuteahumanlikeartificialintelligence.\n\nThe suicide-murderer woman from White Christmas too isn't present since she's clearly non compos mentis. The dogs from Metahlead also aren't present because they are not human and likely just do what their code tells them to do.\n\nSo, here's the rating from the least evil to the most evil:\n\n1. **Carlton Bloom**, the artist from The National Anthem (while kidnapping a person and causing an alarm that shuts down the whole UK for a day is pretty screwed up, he didn't harm the princess nor her security, and he didn't even wanted the Prime Minister to actually make love with a pig, so he's definetely the least evil one)\n2. **The three judges** from 15 Millions Merits (I know manipulating a woman into porn is evil, but you have to put it into the perspective of the whole society wanting it)\n3. **Baxter** from White Bear (He does pretty screwed up shit to a woman, but again when you see the whole crowd cheering for it you feel the fault falls on the whole society)\n4. **The hacker(s)** from SUAD (aren't placed high here only because they don't do very very much evil, but still they are quite shitheads)\n5. **Matt Trent** from White Christmas (he's a torturer indeed, but only cookies and he isn't shown to believe that cookies have sentience, and also the whole society belives cookies don't have human rights)\n6. **Robert Daly** from USS Callister (a step higher than Matt since his purpose for torturing cookies is enslaving them to live his wicked power fantasies)\n7. **The policeman** from White Christmas who sentences Joe's cookie to millions of years in a room listening to the same song (loses Evil Points just because of the societal factor. But that's a gratuitous act of evil. Daly at least was doing it because of a mental illness)\n8. **Rolo Haynes** from Black Museum (he made his business around torturing cookies. Also, he is shown to believe cookies have sentience)\n9. **Garret Scholes**, the bee hacker from HITN (you just don't kill 400k people because you don't like them, I don't care if you believe they had it coming)\n10. **Jack Napier**, the producer from The Waldo Moment (the generic tyrant without any real ideology who only cares about gaining power)\n11. **Mia Nolan** from Crocodile (she has plenty of time to think back about her actions, feels no sincere remorse, kills a f\\*cking toddler, isn't convinced she's acting for a higher purpose. Just no.)\n12. **Arquette** from Men Against Fire (It is true that he has an ideology behind him and so the fact that he thinks he's acting for a higher purpose might make him lose points. But this ideology is literal nazism, and the fact that the government has to hide what they do to the public means the ideology wouldn't be accepted by the current society. So it's more likely they kill people and brainwash their soldiers just because.)",

I just do hope not.\n\nAs long there no is, everything's fine to me, I'm just curious if its intended and if there are some statements from the developers of the show.\nIt seems to me like no coincidence that every protagonist in the lastest season was solely female.\n\nI love this show but I'm not a fan of the premise when such episodes originate from the sort of some agenda, especially because I think Season 4 was the weakest overall. \n\nWhich should not mean that it's the fault of the choice of their protagonists, but when their first priority was to enforce minoritys, than maybe they disctracted to much from their primary goal of creating a superb show.\n\nI'm really into diversity and I like that this series has so much different protagonists from an ethical standpoint, much better than those typical hollywood clichee's but I'm a bit worried that they just try to hard to not implement... well... people like me.\n\nDon't get me wrong it doesn't matter in the end, but I'm worried that it sometimes goes to a point where the story just feels forced, I did have some of this vibes in Episode 4x03 which seemed to me like it was better suited for a male role... I don't know but I wasn't impressed of the performance of the actor. \nespecially when this skinny woman just strangled her physical more superior old boyfriend.\n\nSo yeah that's all, I hope for a peaceful discussion I don't want to make anyone mad it just came to my mind after watching 4x06.\n\nIt has it flaws in the latest episodes, but it's still a great show.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But Hang The DJ's premise is about having that perfect match out there based on algorithms, and you're put in a confined environment to determine whether the two of you are a perfect match.\n\nMTV's Are You The One brings in 10 males and 10 females, already pre-matched with their 'Perfect Match' and its up to each of them to find out who that Perfect Match is. There's even a honey moon room, similar to Hang the DJ, where you go to with your match and get to know them better, etc.\n\nWhat really struck me as similar was an episode in Season 4 (first season I've watched, just saw it on TV and checked it out) and this guy, John, was vividly upset because he believed he had found true love in this girl, but the computer algorithm told him that she wasn't his perfect match, and therefore, he should no longer pursue her, for the sake of winning the game. But his argument was, \"who's meant to tell me who my perfect match is, isn't that for me to determine, not an algorithm?\"",

And I don't care if it's realistic, this is a show about how you can clone someone's consciousness into a monkey!\n\nI think he should periodically come back with no explanation, no context, and just occasionally roll(o) through with a warm smile and an easy solution.\n\nFor a price, of course.

        "text": "Sorry if this has been discussed here before, I'm pretty new to this sub.\n\nRegarding the cookies in White Christmas.  I get that Matt breaks them mentally in order to get them to comply.  I understand that by the time they have been alone with nothing to do, the idea of running the functions of the house seems appealing, and the alternative is their hell.  But I do find it strange that Matt has seemingly never had a situation where the cookie attempted to rebel, and do something like burn the house down or sabotage the person's life.  He may have put safeguards in place to prevent something like that from happening, but I feel like even just doing a shitty job would be an act of rebellion that a cookie would try at some point.  This may have been talked about in the episode but it's been a little while since I've seen it.\n\nWhy not alter the cookie's mind so that it's not an \"exact\" copy of the host?  It seems like the technology would be able to take away, or at least reduce the cookie's desire to be free and have a mind of their own.  In it's place they could implement a desire to do anything for the host, and make running the house their passion as well as their priority.\n\nIt would have been more humane, and would have saved Matt a potential heap of trouble if his business had lasted longer.  I know it wouldn't have been as interesting as an episode, so I get it.  But it's just a thought.",
