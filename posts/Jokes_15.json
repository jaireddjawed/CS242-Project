This is a Catholic country; this city is the seat of Catholicism. People aren't going to give you money if you sit there with a Star of David in front of you, especially when you're sitting beside a beggar who has a cross.

Tom said excitingly \" as much as you can dish out!\". The trainer got a smirk on his face and told him to accompany him to the new state-of-the-art training facility.\n\nUpon entering the new facility, he noticed that there were no training machines nor dumbbells, just a running track. Tom asked: so what's going on here?\n\nThe trainer told him there are three levels to this program. And asked him to take the first one for a test drive.\n\nTom agrees.\n\nOut came a beautiful woman, like an 8/10. Gave him a wink and told him \"If you can catch me, you can fuck me straight up!\"\n\nTom's pupils dilated out of sheer excitement and agreed. He told her to run and she ran and he ran after her. 20min went by.  he then finally catches her and fucks her on the spot.  Excited with his result, he checks his weight and indeed he lost a bit of weight but not enough.\n\nHe asks the trainer for the second level.\n\n\nThe trainer obliged.\n\nOut comes a hotter lady, a straight 9.5, smoking hot, thinner than the one before, more athletic and with an ass that would bring the entire European union down.\n\nThe guy gets really excited for the second round, says to the lady Run! And rushes after her. A couple hours go by and he finally catches her and fucks her. He's sweating like an elephant just out of the pond. He looks at his weight and this time there is considerable progress! He's hyperventilating, sweaty and barely able to stand on his feet but he mutters to the trainer: \"Next level please\". \n\nThe trainer tells him that no one ever wanted to do 3rd level on the account that they were tired from the first two and already have seen progress. \"Are you sure you wanna do this ?\"  Tom with absolute certainty says \"yes I do\"\n\nSuit yourself, said the trainer.\n\nThe door opens... Out comes Shaquille O'Neal himself. Takes one look at Tom and says... \"Run bitch!\"",

You know what they say about rich men, needles, and camels ... anyhow, we use Amigas ...\" \n\nThen, suddenly, beyond the pearly gates, a familiar figure appears. The poor architect falls into an apoplectic fit: \"Look, look, you told me he'd never find a place in heaven, but it's him.\" \n\nSt.Peter turns around to see the sight. \"Ah, no my son, that's God, he just thinks he's Bill Gates ...\"",
