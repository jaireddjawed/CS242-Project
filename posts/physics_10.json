In order to get the proposal accepted, I had to agree to model the field in 3 dimensions rather than 2. To do this I have decided to measure the field strength in a 3cm^3 cube, one measurement for each ‚Äúunit‚Äù (center of each cubic centimeter). To model it however, I thought of assigning each strength a certain weight, and then making a heat map, showing the field strength at a point on a 3 dimensional grid. I am, however, uncertain about what software to use to do this. If you have any suggestions or potential improvements to the design please let me know! I made this post on my phone so I apologize in advance if there are any formatting issues and if there is anything unclear about the experiment please ask. Thank you!",

He told that if a person flinched less from the recoil when firing a gun, the projectile would go further. It didn't quite fit with me since I know a thing or two about how firearms operate. His argument was that the expanding gas also pushed towards the back, and if we were able to resist the \"push\" move energy would be transfered to the projectile. I said that the \"kick\" came from the reactionary force from the projectile and gasses that get expelled from the end of the barrel and the initial speed of the bullet is determined mainly by the chemical energy in the powder among other small factors. This is all assuming you are stationary while using identical bullets in the same firearm obviously. I looked up online so I couldn't find any direct answers, so I decided you guys might be able to help. Thank you in advance.",

The protons and neutrons are held together by the strong nuclear force because of their proximity. Then using quantum mechanics, you can show that electrons occupy different energy levels determined by the composition of the nucleus, and depending on the number of protons and neutrons, you can get certain practically stable arrangements, and we call them elements or atoms, depending on the context. And then of course you can have different atoms trade electrons or have them at least interact, and we call the behaviors that arise from that \"chemistry\". \n\nCan you have a parallel set of things happen with a different arrangement of elementary particles. Maybe if they last more than nanoseconds, could there even be a periodic-like table for different compositions, and even a parallel chemistry-like behavior. I'm on the chemical synthesis side of chemical engineering (heterogeneous catalyst synthesis), so this is completely outside of my wheelhouse. \n\nThanks!",

As far as I know, the vacuum could change into another vacuum with a different energy potential (which would have different properties like different symmetries [1]). For example, it is an assumption in some \"bumblebee models\" [2], that some vacua may break the Lorentz symmetry.\n\nThere are proposed fundamental theories of physics (like theories of everything such as string theory) that could underlie the most fundamental laws of the universe. Like any other theory, these theories of everything have a set of fundamental symmetries. But as I said before, vacuum phase transitions could change the fundamental symmetries of the theory... \n\nTherefore, even if we had a theory of everything like string theory, could there be a vacuum phase transition that would end up in a vacuum state that would be so different that all the fundamental symmetries of the underlying theory would break and therefore the underlying theory would cease to apply? Could there be a vacuum phase transition into a vacuum that would be outside the predicted landscape of the underlying theory? Would be a catastrophic vacuum be an example of this? Is there something forbidding this?\n\nJust to be clear, I'm not talking about \"spontaneous symmetry breaking\" where the symmetry is broken in the vacuum but it remains fundamentally. I'm referring to an actual breakdown of these symmetires where they do not hold even at fundamental levels\n\n[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2601\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee_models",

I understand how no information is passed, like for instance if you said I'm going to collapse the wave function of one particle and therefore when you observe the wave function collapse of the second particle, it means you should \"go to war\" or \"strike now.\" I understand that you can't observe the second particle collapsing, because observing it or monitoring the second particle will collapse the wave function no matter what so you can't tell if it was already collapsed or if you collapsed it yourself. So here's why I think you can still use it for communication. If you take let's say 1000 entangled particles and put 500 in one location and 500 in a different location and then at both locations you start shooting one entangled particle at a time through a double slit you should see an interference pattern emerge at both locations. Then if at one location you start to measure which slit each particle is going through it should collapse the wave function of both particles. Shouldn't you notice through secondary observation that at the second location the particles stop forming an interference pattern? And if they stop forming an interference pattern at the second location couldn't you use that as an indicator to \"do\" something?",

It is just spectacular.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is that, though we know things as facts, do you ever really think about what it is you know? As an example, Brian Coxx went to the world's largest vacuum chamber to drop a feather and a bowling ball. We know what will happen due to our physics knowledge; however, every single physicist who took part in the experiment was absolutely astonished.

        "text": "I'm a physicist and a science journalist. But I‚Äôm also a video game fan. Right now, I'm preparing an explanation of the physics hidden on the whiteboards in the Black Mesa game ‚Äî a fan remake of legendary Half-Life which was blessed by Valve itself. After all, Half-Life is a first-person shooter about physicists and enthusiasts decided to emphasize this by equipping the interiors of laboratories with excerpts from scientific articles on various topics: from gravitation and nuclear physics to superconductivity and nanophotonics. It's very interesting to figure this out.\n\nIn the course of such an analysis I made a small discovery and decided not to leave it for later, when I finish the whole text, but to tell you about it right now.\n\nMy discovery concerns the [tau cannon](https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Tau_Cannon) - a fictional weapon with which Gordon Freeman deals. Valve themselves did not really understand its physical basis, so at the early stages of development they considered it to be a [railgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun). Later it turned into a hand accelerator of the heaviest known leptons - tauons. The mass could explain the piercing ability of the weapon as well as the large recoil although in real life tau leptons live [no longer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_(particle)) than a picosecond and certainly could not fly anywhere.\n\nHere is a [link](https://app-images.website.yandexcloud.net/755655/87806ff55112ba3178d186da7605b884.png) to the whiteboard with the tau cannon scheme (which is no longer a tau cannon). The image is the result of AI-upscaling of the original whiteboard made by Steam user Cursed Gman (Dany).\n\nSo. The Tau Cannon in Black Mesa has its own whiteboard (see the image above). From it we learn that it is now not a Tau Cannon but an \"Accelerated Lepton Optronic Linearity Cannon\". From the diagram we can see that there is a battery closer to the stock that powers the synchrotron and accelerating coils. What do they accelerate?\n\nIf you look carefully at the formulae at the top, you will see the trace of a theory describing [Bremsstrahlung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremsstrahlung) (braking radiation) that occurs when accelerated electrons pass through an atomic cloud. The label \"EM Field Inducer\" next to the barrel with an arrow pointing to an unreadable writings with the word \"bremsstrahlung\" also indicates that electromagnetic radiation is emitted from the cannon.\n\nThis change, by the way, benefited the logic of the weapon. The protagonist finds it in a lab where powerful laser radiation is being studied. An accelerator of tauons or a railgun in this case would indeed have looked less appropriate.\n\nI have [posted](https://nplus1.ru/blog/2023/02/17/ALOL) my discovery originally on russian science news magazine N + 1. Here is an adaptation and a translation of this text for /r/Physics.",

        "text": " \n\nScientists have made significant advancements in mapping lightning in 3D, which has helped to improve our understanding of this powerful natural phenomenon. Traditional lightning mapping techniques, such as radar and satellite-based systems, could only provide limited information about lightning strikes, such as their location and intensity. However, the development of 3D mapping techniques has allowed researchers to gain a more comprehensive view of lightning and its behavior.\n\nOne such technique involves the use of high-speed cameras and sophisticated computer algorithms to capture and analyze lightning strikes in real-time. By combining the data from multiple cameras and sensors, researchers can create a 3D map of the lightning, which can help to identify its path, shape, and other characteristics.\n\nThis technology has been used to study lightning in a range of environments, from urban areas to remote regions. It has also been used to study the behavior of lightning during storms and hurricanes, which can help to improve weather forecasting and emergency response efforts.\n\nIn addition to improving our understanding of lightning, 3D mapping techniques have also led to the development of new lightning protection systems for buildings, aircraft, and other structures. By identifying the most vulnerable areas and components of these structures, engineers can design more effective lightning protection systems that can minimize damage and prevent accidents.\n\nOverall, the development of 3D mapping techniques for lightning has opened up new avenues for research and has the potential to improve our ability to predict and mitigate the effects of lightning strikes.",

Certainly, logically, there must be an energy, a base sustaining that movement and that base energy is prior to quantum fluctuations and the appearance of particles because it is their very existence that allows precisely that they can arise.  \nNow, that base energy is prior to the fluctuations, prior to the movement of particles and as I said at the beginning, measurement and movement are closely related so it would be impossible to calculate the total energy of that base energy of the vacuum, because essentially all our science is based on calculating on measuring but before that base energy that is prior to the movement we can not do anything, We can only calculate the effects of that vacuum energy once it manifests itself in fluctuations and particles but 'the base' of that energy will always be hidden from science, from calculations.",

        "text": " \n\nThe \"tadpole\" is a gas cloud with a tail that extends for more than 2.5 light-years and appears to be moving at an unusual speed of about 90 kilometers per second. The astronomers who made the discovery believe that the tail of the \"tadpole\" is being stretched by the gravity of a massive object, which they suspect to be a black hole.\n\nThe black hole in question is thought to be one of the so-called intermediate-mass black holes, which are smaller than the supermassive black holes found at the centers of most galaxies, but larger than the stellar-mass black holes that form from the collapse of individual stars. Intermediate-mass black holes are extremely rare and have been difficult to detect, but astronomers believe that they could play an important role in the evolution of galaxies.\n\nThe discovery of this \"tadpole\" is therefore an important step towards understanding the nature and distribution of intermediate-mass black holes in the universe. It also highlights the importance of continued efforts to study the center of our own galaxy, where many such rare objects may be hiding.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, which is a radio telescope that is particularly well-suited to studying cold gas and dust in space. The researchers published their findings in the journal Nature Astronomy in February 2023.",
