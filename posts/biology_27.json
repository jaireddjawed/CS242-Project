        "text": "Hi everyone. I've been using an E.coli variant of bacterial for over a year for a research project. My test system requires the bacteria to produce the secondary metabolite, colibactin.\n\nHowever, suddenly my bacteria have started growing at a much faster rate (3x-5x faster than previously) and have stopped producing colibactin. My growth procedure involves growing the bacteria in LB broth with kanamycin, incubating for 16 hours at room temp, then 1 hour at 37 degrees (shaking incubator).\n\nAny ideas as to why this is happening?",

New to the subreddit (definitely should have joined a while ago), but not new at all to biology - am a PhD student looking for some help in finding gear.  \n\n\nI'm doing experimental work with gps loggers on birds, and I'm in urgent need of a new source of gps trackers.\n\nThe most important specification is that we need ones that record at frequencies in the realm of 5Hz - 5 readings per second. A lot will only do 1 per second or fewer, which just isn't high resolution enough. The challenge in combination with this has been that we really only need the most basic of devices - our data is capture-recapture, so remote transmission isn't necessary, and the majority of available GPS devices become extremely expensive for all the fancy extras they offer which we've no use for.\n\nAlmost anything will do - we were using QTravel sports loggers; yanking the GPS chips out of them to miniaturise them, until they were discontinued...\n\nCheers!",

        "text": "Sources: NIH/ResearchGate. It's been proven the brain directly controls the immune system. Scientists have shown that someone with a verified allergy will not have a reaction to an allergen if they are hypnotised into believing they're no longer allergic to the allergen. Their immune systems actually ignore the allergen. It's also been proven that thinking about an allergen causes antibodies to be made specific to the allergen, causing an allergy. The brain and the body are closely connected. If the brain is convinced it is allergic to something, so will the immune system. If the brain is convinced it is no longer allergic to something, the immune system will be as well. Just because the immune system is a physical system doesn't mean it isn't controlled by thoughts or the brain. Recently it has been discovered that trauma and stress have been associated with the development of allergies. Follow the science even if it goes against your worldview. As the years go by more and more scientists are becoming convinced that allergies are neuroimmunological.\n\nBabies can have allergies, babies can also be born with neurological disorders and phobias/aversions.\n\nThe brain controls virtually every physical system in your body. You can have a physical reaction just from thinking something since the brain controls pretty much every physical system in the body.\n\nBurn blisters can actually appear on your body if you're hypnotised into believing you are burned. That's a physical reaction caused by thought alone. There's been several cases of full-on stab wounds appearing on people's bodies after they remembered a particularly traumatic event in which they were once stabbed in the same area. The mind is very powerful.",

        "text": "Bit of background info. I'm a girl in her early twenties, double vaccinated(moderna vaccine) Since the start of January this year I believe I have had covid at least two separate occasions. First time this year I was at a group where someone had a cold, then the next evening I did a covid test and it came back with a faint pink line on it, a week later on the next Monday I did another covid test(on the covid tests I had done between those dates, I was getting completely negative tests) and again I had another very faint line on it. It's now a week and a half later, and there's been a bit of a cold/slight cough going round at home, and about four days ago I started getting this weird ear ache/head ache and like every test I have done over the past four days is either negative or a very faint line comes up but then the line sort of disappears later on? I don't know what to fucking think at this point and I'm also really upset firstly because even with reading evidence that covid vaccine lowers your immune system, most people who had the vaccine that I know, typically went at least two weeks after they last had covid, without getting a reinfection of covid 19, I've read that three to four weeks is the point at which your immunity/antibodies starts to decrease. I'm also very scared because I do get anxiety but a few months ago I was sneezing and wheezing a bit and then the wheezing thing happened another time a week later. It feels weird because a lot of people I know in real life, are still very anxious about covid but at the same time when other people are at groups with coughs and stuff, compared to a couple of years ago, most people seem more relaxed with it. When I was 12 I had to go to hospital for surgery for self harm and I feel like this has made my health/death anxiety much worse because I'm terrified of getting/having covid and having to be hospitalised, like I'm honestly terrified\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10okay2)",

I want to do some exciting topics that aren't boring but are exciting to both novices and people who know a lot about biology. They should be relatively easy but produce cool results. I was thinking of growing bio luminescent algae, or possibly making mini self sustaining terrariums in water bottles or something.\n\nRequirements:  \n\\- Preferably something that doesn't involve an animal with actual blood (I'm sure there are a few edge cases but I'm sure you know what I mean.)  \n\\- I plan on getting fundraisers and funding some of this myself, but I'd prefer if it didn't break the bank or if various ideas can reuse previous equipment or equipment you would find in any simple science lab.\n\nHoping for stuff that can fill up a whole year (And maybe a second) and get as many of my fellow peers to enjoy it.

        "text": "I've been scrolling articles on Wikipedia about the life origins for the past hours and from further reading of the precambrian, I've encountered the hadean eon (which is, as understand, from formation of Earth to 4 billion years ago). During that period (about 4.5 billion years ago) the hypothetical \"Big Splash\" happened when the two planets: our young Earth collided with a Mars-sized Theia, which could have brought much of water and formed today's Moon.\n\nNow, the earliest exact evidence of known life on Earth are stromatolites, dating as far as 3.5 b years. But some other fossils suggest that life could exist 4.2 b years. On the other hand, University of Bristol, using molecular clock, moves the starting point even beyond - up to 4.5 b years.\n\nSo, my question is - if all above is true is there any chance that life rose from Theia (Moon?) and somehow survived the collision to then succeed in the absolutely new environment? I'm genuinely curious, though I know it sounds like a dumb thought at 2 am. However, that's not true. It is 4 am now where I live.\n\nWill be glad to know what you think!",
