You can actually divide it by 3 and get a whole number, as well as a whole lot of other divisors. Also, most people are familiar with the idea of a circle having 360 degrees, so it would be fairly intuitive to think of portions as being sections of a circle. it might make it easier to draw pie charts.\n\nthe one problem that it could run into is the fact that our counting system is a decimal system, so converting decimals to percirca will probably be a pain.",

Choosing the case k=4 you can clearly see that all the negative terms after n reaches 4 start cancelling out as well as all the positive terms after n=4 and we are left with 1/4(1+1/2+1/3+1/4). Noticing the pattern I understood that the series 1/(n(n+k)) converges to 1/k(1+1/2+1/3+...+1/k). If we assume that it also works for real k we can rewrite it as 1/k*H_k which means that H_k = Σ[n=1,∞](k/(n(n+k))). I checked on desmos and it really looks like the harmonic number function! Is there any formal proof that it works for any real k?",

I have a copy of “Measure, Integration &amp; Real Analysis” by Dr Sheldon Axler, and some of it simply does not compute. Can’t seem to grasp sigma-algebra, Borel sets and the like and I’m feeling it hard with Fourier nowadays.",

He told me that I could start by reading a paper first, which involves some applications of statistical physics to combinatorics. I’m new to statistical physics, so I am (painfully and slowly) reading the paper, and looking for other relevant notes and workshop videos and so on.\n\nI’m interested in pursuing research in combinatorics as a phd student in the near future, so I think it’s good training for me.\n\nStill, I was wondering that how you, master or phd students, read papers which may have some materials that are new to you? How do you digest and try to understand? What’s reasonable “reading speed “ in such cases?",

Now, I’m a pure math student, so I haven’t been terribly interested in the development, but recently I have gotten into category theory after finishing up my algebra textbook, and noticed some potential applications. This is still a very new thought in my mind, but one crude example is that category theory provides tools to view objects purely relationally, which seems perfectly applicable to language, where words are defined relationally to other words as well. Are there well-known applications of category theory to NLP and is it approachable for an undergrad?",
