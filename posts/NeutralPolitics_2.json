        "text": "The United States' federal government is a [bicameral legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress) with a House of Representatives and Senate.  Before the [Seventeenth Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) was ratified in 1912, Senators weren't directly elected; instead, State legislatures appointed two Senators for six year terms each. George Mason, one of the original founders, argued that [\"...state legislative solutions gave states the power of self-defense against the federal government.\"](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) Wendell Pierce held a different view, arguing that [\"...the contrast between a state legislatively-appointed Senate and a popularly elected House would increase the types of interests represented in the federal government. By requiring the consent of two different constituencies in the House and the state legislatures in the Senate-- the composition of the Senate was seen as essential to the system of bicameralism, which would require 'the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy'.\"](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii)\n\nContrast this with the German [Bundesrat](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/organisation-en/organisation-en-node.html). According to the [*German Basic Law (Article 51)](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Rather than two representatives with six year terms per person inhabiting the institution, the state governments send delegations of representatives that act in the will of the composition of that state, ensuring indirect majority-rule from the bottom-up. Each delegation receives votes based on the population of their state; [\"Länder (State governments) with more than two million inhabitants shall have four, Länder with more than six million inhabitants five, and Länder with more than seven million inhabitants six votes.\"](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Most German states use some variation of proportional representation for their electoral systems, so representatives tend to represent more than [two political parties at once](https://www.bundesrat.de/SharedDocs/bilder/EN/artikel/zusammensetzung.jpg?__blob=panorama&amp;v=23).  They're subject to [recall](http://www.senat.fr/senatsdumonde/english/germanyenglish.html) at any time by the state government, whereas U.S Senators [are not](https://www.dailysignal.com/2010/02/02/can-u-s-senators-be-recalled/).  \n\n\nIs the German system of majority rule in both federal legislative houses conducive to people's liberty or detrimental to the long-term liberty of the people? Does it represent everyone or is it failing in protecting minorities? By and large, do U.S Senators succeed or fail to represent their state, and if they fail, does the German system offer a means by which to achieve success?  Is it possible to reconcile gerrymandering and the two-party system with fair representation in government alongside the goal of Senators to represent the entirety of their state in the federal legislature?\n\nHow does one define the representation of a state:  If its the government, does that mean the entire legislative branch of a state is represented or merely the majority?  If it's the people, then does that include everyone, or the constituents who voted for said U.S Senators?\n",

[This article](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180905/NEWS/180909977?AllowView=VDl3UXg1T3dDdkdCbkJiYkY0M3pjME9najBVZERlRT0) summarizes the legal arguments. But several of the points don't make sense to me as a layman. I'm hoping to find some clarification.\n\n&gt; O'Connor, in his questions from the bench, cut straight to the so-called severability in the case—whether Congress, when it zeroed out the tax penalty in the 2017 tax overhaul, intended to keep the popular consumer protections in place. \n\nCongress voted to remove the mandate but Republicans could not get enough votes to remove the consumer protections. Does not voting to remove those protections when they voted on the tax bill constitute intent of Congress to keep those protections? Is congressional intent solely determined by the votes they take?\n\n&gt; The ACA contains provisions stating that the individual mandate is \"essential to creating effective health insurance markets in which improved health insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not include coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.\"\n\nHow or why does the original intent matter here? Congress decided to eliminate the mandate and keep the rest of the ACA. Does that change Congress' intent for the purposes of severability? Is the later Congress' intent the one which matters?\n\n&gt; \"If the only saving of the ACA is the Supreme Court's read of the penalty as a tax, and Congress knew that but zeroed out the penalty knowing that it cannot be upheld as a tax—and Congress is presumed to act with knowledge of the Supreme Court's rulings, why isn't that intent?\" O'Connor asked.\n\nWhat does he mean by \"knowing that it cannot be upheld as a tax\"? Is he saying that the mandate is not a tax despite the Supreme Court ruling? Or is he saying that a 0% tax is unconstitutional? If so, would the entire ACA be unconstitutional instead of just the amendment that zeroed it out?",

        "text": "You can find a full timeline of events [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists-timeline/timeline-reuters-journalists-detained-in-myanmar-idUSKBN1JY0U9), but I'll try to sum it up:\n\n&gt;On Dec. 12, 2017, Burmese Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were working on an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya men in Myanmar's Rakhine state by Myanmar's military when they were handed documents related to the massacre unsolicited from police at a restaurant. As they exited the restaurant, they were arrested under the Official Secrets Act for possession of the documents in an apparent set up by police.\n\n&gt;As more details emerged, the government acknowledged its role in the massacre, and that the information in the documents were already public knowledge. One police officer admitted in court that there was a police order to entrap the reporters.\n\nThe judge has now [found the reporters guilty](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists/reuters-myanmar-reporters-jailed-for-seven-years-in-landmark-secrets-case-idUSKCN1LJ09E), and sentenced them to 7 years of prison.\n\nThe case had been seen as a test of Myanmar's progress toward democracy, and the verdict has [received condemnation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-journalists-reax-factbox/factbox-reactions-to-verdict-on-reuters-myanmar-journalists-idUSKCN1LJ0AJ) from the US ambassador to Myanmar and a slew of human rights and pro-journalism advocacy groups.\n\nWhat I want to know is what effective action can be taken in response to the ruling, if any, both within Myanmar and in the international community. The US recently [enacted targeted sanctions](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-usa/u-s-imposes-sanctions-on-myanmar-military-over-rohingya-crackdown-idUSKBN1L21KL) against members of Myanmar's military in reaction to the Rohingya crisis, but left out its commander-in-chief. Could we see more of those?\n\nOne potential problem is that [China supports Myanmar](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-china/china-offers-support-to-myanmar-at-u-n-amid-rohingya-crisis-idUSKCN1BU070), including against international pressure regarding the Rohingya crisis. Could they emerge as a more dominant player in the conversation?",
