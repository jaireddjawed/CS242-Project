        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/5fpyp1/how_the_editing_by_uspez_could_potentially_limit/",
        "text": "**Edit:** /u/spez has now [made an announcement regarding this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/).\n\n---\n\nThere is an unfortunate misconception that Reddit is just a place to find pictures of cats and other trivial content. I see why Reddit has developed this reputation (there are many great cat pics), but it is a shame because meaningful things happen on Reddit every day.\n\n**On any given day you can find the following things happening:**\n\n* Leaders, professionals, and experts engaging communities and developing their audiences\n* Crowd-sourced Q&amp;A dialogues with influential and fascinating people\n* \"Random acts of kindness\" and other various charitable acts\n* Users developing long-term relationships with each other based on shared interests\n\nThese interactions and experiences are extremely unique and valuable in an internet world that is dominated by traditional follower/following social media feeds. The developers and administrators of Reddit now have an opportunity to not only increase the quantity of meaningful interactions, but also facilitate even bigger and more valuable activities. Reddit could be a more influential space where the most important problems are solved.\n\nWith great power, comes great responsibility and unfortunately Reddit administration continues to make decisions that prevent Reddit from being a platform for more people and bigger projects. The recent action by /u/spez is the latest example of how Reddit holds itself back from becoming one of the most important platforms online.\n\n*In case you are out of the loop, one week ago (November 23rd, 2016) Reddit CEO Steve Huffman (/u/spez) admitted to anonymously editing a number of comments that were personally attacking him. Huffman made a series of edits that followed a pattern. He edited comments that said \"fuck /u/spez\" (\"spez\" is his username on Reddit) and replaced \"spez\" with the usernames of moderators of T_D. Huffman said he did this under the stress of dealing with the /r/Pizzagate controversy.*\n\n##The Implications of \"The Editing\"\n\nReddit has always operated under the assumption that content would never be secretly edited by the site's admins. Many online communities allow moderators or admins to publicly edit comments, but this has never been a feature of Reddit. Since *The Editing*, users and the media have questioned their trust in the platform.\n\n*It has also surfaced that /u/spez [edited a title 7 years ago to change the word \"namefag\" to \"namefog\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/5f5en1/7_years_ago_spez_was_caught_editing_the_title_of/). Similar to the most recent editing, he made the edit secretly and admitted to changing it shortly after, citing \"hate speech\" as his justification for doing so.*\n\nFor users who want to see Reddit continue to evolve and take on more important projects, *The Editing* has raised serious doubts about the potential of Reddit:\n\n**Can major global leaders trust Reddit to serve as a platform for communication?** Politicians at the highest levels have used Reddit in the past (Barack Obama did an AMA in 2012), but the risk profile of Reddit has changed because of The Editing.\n\n**Can activists trust Reddit to serve as a platform for community organizing?** Any organization with a cause that is politically incorrect or out-of-step with the personal beliefs of Reddit administrators is less likely to consider Reddit as a viable option.\n\n**Can lawyers use Reddit content as evidence?** Content from social media is being used regularly as evidence in legal matters. I'm not a lawyer, but I would assume it is now much easier to discredit Reddit content in the court of law. This could have serious implications for individuals involved in both civil and criminal court cases.\n\n**Can an organization or individual hold a contest with high-value prizes on Reddit?** If someone wanted to give away $1M on Reddit, their lawyers would have to consider *The Editing* and the associated legal risks.\n\n##What is the Future of Reddit?\n\nThe concerns above illustrate how *The Editing* raises more questions about Reddit as a trustworthy platform and therefore holds it back from becoming more influential and valuable. Until Reddit takes action to restore trust in their administration, they will continue to be seen as a risky option for bigger projects.\n\nFor Reddit to make amends and regain its potential, Huffman most likely needs to step down as CEO. He made the mistake that hurt Reddit and his failure to see the implications of his action suggests he has a limited vision for the platform. From a practical standpoint, I do not see how he can lead the effort of restoring trust with the community.\n\nRegardless of whether Huffman stays or leaves, Reddit must roll out a new development workflow that prevents anyone on their team from making secret edits to user content.\n\nIt has only been a week since *The Editing* and it seems like Reddit might just let this mistake go quietly into the night. If Reddit chooses this option, they are betting that the Reddit community will largely forget about what happened and will ignore the users that insist on reminding them. While this would likely save them short-term headaches, it could also prevent them from becoming anything more than a place to find pictures of cats.",

Assuming I'm not the only one that's noticed this, why do you think comment scores have these dynamics?\n\nI would have thought that, for a good post that has above a certain threshold level of upvotes, the probability of a redditor upvoting the post upon reading would remain relatively constant. However, if this were the case, we would see a steady increase in score until the number of readers fizzled out. Instead, it seems that as the score increases, the probability of an upvote decreases, such that the system is attracted to the score where the probability of upvote and downvote are equal. This is the only explanation I can think of for the apparent period of high voting but constant vote score.\n\nAnyone else ever notice this?",

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5fbldc/this_little_village_won_my_heart/) post at the top of pics? [Spambot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5fbldc/this_little_village_won_my_heart/daj592e/) [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/5fbd0i/i_think_judass_biggest_crime_was_never/) one at the top of funny? Go through [his post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/nexttime7777), it's a spambot too. Notice that it posts a lot in jokonjok's threads who I'm guessing is also a spambot. Here's a few more spambots [1](https://www.reddit.com/user/ali458) [2](https://www.reddit.com/user/pertconverting) [3](https://www.reddit.com/user/AndreMBostick) [4](https://www.reddit.com/user/hithot-) [5](https://www.reddit.com/user/Olmosaio) that I messaged the admins about but they haven't done anything yet. I honestly feel like a good 20% or more of default subreddit activity is from bots, and they are infusing the site more and more by the day. And I'm just seeing the stuff that made it past the spam filter, so there must be lots more actually being posted.\n\nThere are 2 things I want to think about.\n\n1: Is this a bad thing for reddit.com? Well for me personally yes, I would like to communicate with real people, that's the point of the site. But it seems from the upvotes these accounts have that the vast majority of users either don't know they are spambots or don't care. These bots provide content for reddit and keep people engaged with the website. So I would argue: reddit inc. does not actually have a strong incentive to get rid of them. They basically provide free monetizable content and they never complain or leave. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5fbldc/this_little_village_won_my_heart/) shows that bots are good enough to get to the top of a default subreddit. But the logical conclusion of this mindset is that eventually bots will match or outnumber regular users and we'll eventually just be communicating under an AI's idea of content. Doesn't sound too good to me.\n\n2: What would be the best way to address it? Right now, the only way to reliably get these accounts banned is manually PMing the admins by modmailing the closed subreddit /r/reddit.com. My [submissions to /r/spam](https://www.reddit.com/r/spam/comments/5dy6h7/overview_for_ben2211/) go ignored. And even sending a message to /r/reddit.com doesn't work that great, I PMed those 5 accounts I linked above yesterday and they haven't been banned yet. All this is why I think this site is not as effective as it could be when addressing spam. Here are some of my brainstorm ideas for how spam could be addressed:\n\n* This one seems the most basic: Don't allow reposting the exact same source with the exact same title. Reddit even catches it but lets you submit it anyway, I don't know why.\n\n* After a spambot gets enough karma, it starts spamming links to malware and advertisement sites. Gather all of these shady domains in a list and if you make a post that links to one of them, automoderator deletes your post and flags your account for review by admins. Automod can detect if you aren't using np links in subreddits that require them, so it can also make sure users aren't trying to link malware. It would be best to coordinate this with Imgur's owner because these links are sometimes added in edited imgur albums.\n\n* Whenever you make a comment over X characters long, it is searched in reddits comment database by automoderator. If it matches another comment exactly your account is flagged for review. This is what I mean by exactly [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5euh78/do_you_like_winters_why/daf9df3/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3iqz8c/people_who_like_winter_why_do_you_like_it/cuiu8fu/) There is just no chance of an actual user replicating a post like that\n\n* On other forums I went to, they were able to ban a user's IP so they could never remake another account without going to a lot of trouble. Why isn't reddit doing this now with spammers?\n\n* Better tools for mods that allow them to quickly determine if a user is a spambot and flag that account for review. By quickly I mean, right now all you can do is go through their post history manually and google their posts looking for exact duplicates, there should be a way to automate this. While reddit inc might not have a big incentive to address spam because they are financially helpful, mods aren't paid and don't care about that, their main goal is to keep a functioning subreddit community, and they will work hard if given the right tools. \n\nAll of this depends on the admins so those ideas are probably not very likely. Instead here is an idea that does not depend on admins.\n\n* A concerted effort by the mods of default and other large subreddits to educate the user base about spambots and how to spot and report them. I'm thinking like an ELI5 level post similar to  [the first thing I linked](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/) stickied on the front page of every default for a couple months. HOWEVER the big negative is that these bot authors aren't stupid. They will find out that people know how to detect their bots, and rewrite them to avoid common ways of detection.

There are many communities which have capricious moderators, secret rules that automatically ban people who post in disliked subreddits, rampant comment removal, and other quirks. This strongly contributes to the echo chamber phenomenon and I have seen it firsthand in many subreddits. It would be good to have somewhere external and safe where criticisms (and praise) of a community could be collected and viewed by people who are unsure about trusting the people and points of view predominantly espoused by that community.",

        "text": "**Framework:**\n\nThere are many reasons why a user chooses to upvote or downvote a post, whether it adds to the conversations, contains factually wrong information, is funny, is disturbing, or just agrees or disagrees with your own point of view. These are understandable dynamics at play when both the upvote and downvote buttons are available.\n\nThe community here has evolved around using this system, and has grown from these simple rules to a fully-developed society with social norms and etiquette. In fact, it works so well, it mirrors very closely the IRL society in terms of the exchange of ideas and flow of information. Social checks and balances exist on reddit as they do in the real world. The Westborough Baptist Church exercises it's Constitutionally-given right for free speech, but other groups who oppose their message can exercise their right to blockade, protest, or shout down the WBC. Free speech is allowed, but those who exercise it to the extreme will face natural consequences from the larger community. This is what makes Reddit fundamentally successful and relatively self-governming, and this model has been used far and wide on the internet for good reason.\n\nAll of this completely breaks down, however, when certain factions of reddit are not subjected to the natural consequences of this system. When certain factions disable, remove, hide, or impede downvoting the natural consequences of a system that use up/downvotes no longer apply. The natural, social system of checks and balances within reddit as a whole is lost, and any faction within reddit willing to suppress downvoting gains an unreasonable platform. \n\n***\n**Identifying the Key Issues:**\n\nI understand, however, that in light of other problems like brigading, some smaller subreddit mods have found the ability to manipulate the ability to downvote to be a useful tool. Any rule or change in enforcement would need to be sure not to break other parts of the reddit ecosystem. Things to keep in mind would be:\n\n* The admin and moderators simply don't have the resources to police every single rule violation.\n\n* The nature of CSS and webpage design make it extremely difficult to prevent in software the manipulation of up/downvote buttons. There are myriad ways of doing this in CSS and always new ways being created.\n\n* The rules are kept vague so that the admin and moderators can wield appropriate action when they deem necessary. The rules are also kept vague so as not to stifle creativity or expression on the site.\n\n* Up/downvoting can't actually be removed by a subreddit's CSS, only masked or blocked. A user can freely disable the subreddit CSS to gain back access to all voting capabilities at any time.\n\n* Completely unrestricted access to downvoting has it's own set of perils, highlighted by your post above. This includes brigading, idea suppression efforts, trolling, and so forth. Moderators need access to tools and methods to combat these actions in order to keep their subreddits healthy and growing.\n\n* Masking or otherwise removing the ability for the community to downvote at all can result in one group on reddit gaining a disproportional speech advantage over all the other groups. By not allowing the natural social processes of the full community to be self-policing (via downvoting), the group which has suppressed downvoting is effectively able to amplify it's voice above all others.\n\nAll of these items above need to be addressed in any potential solution. The blanket outlawing of manipulation of ability to up/downvote seems to be unworkable. It would be unmanageable for the admins, difficult to enforce for the mods, and would take away an important tool that many mods rely on.\n\n***\n**Possible Solutions:**\n\nSo, what about these ideas (or combinations thereof):\n\n1) If a subreddit is over X-thousand subscribers, disallowing CSS voter suppression/manipulation becomes a rule. This wouldn't be enforced automatically by software, but could be self-policed by the community via the Report functionality at which point admins could look at the situation and determine needs.\n\n2) Mods are given tools to prevent downvoting for the first X-minutes of a post's life.\n\n3) If CSS styling of the up/downvote functionalty has been modified on the site, add some kind of disclaimer making sure people know that.\n\n4) Simply change the paradigm of what is considered manipulation of site functionality. I've argued above that masking the ability for any user to downvote breaks a) the fundamental nature of reddit, b) prevents any kind of natural community self-policing, and c) gives the subreddit doing this an unfair advantage in their speech.\n\n5) Allowing CSS to hide or mask up/downvoting for non-subscribed users, but making it an enforceable rule that subscribed users must be allowed 1-click access for casting a vote.\n\n***\n**Closing:**\n\nNo doubt, I'm still missing a lot of nuance with this issue, but I have confidence that the community as a whole can come up with a solution that everyone is generally happy with. Either from these ideas above, some combination thereof, or from ideas which haven't been created yet. \n\nThe removal, masking, or impeding of a user's ability to downvote is manipulation of reddit's fundamental voting system. It is no different than real-world suppression of speech, and it is closely related to voter suppression at the polls. While it can be useful in some cases, when it is applied in large quantities, it seriously harms the ability of this community to have a civil, rational conversation of ideas. \n\nImpeding a user's ability to downvote is vote manipulation.

        "text": "If you're not aware, mods can and do surreptitiously delete comments. \n\nIt's similar to how submissions are deleted. You will still be able to see your own submission like nothing happened, but for every other reddit user, it has been deleted. \n\n***THE ISSUE***\n\nYou may have noticed this phenomon in large comment threads that are \"nuked,\" or deleted with prejudice by the mods. You can still view your own comments in context, but every other comment appears deleted. If you logout, you will see your comment has been deleted as well. For example, [this is what my comment looks like responding to a troll when logged in viewed in context](http://i.imgur.com/XDp045N.png), and [this shows what the comment thread looks like when logged out](http://i.imgur.com/KfBpo36.png). If I had not logged out, or even looked at the context of the comment later in time, I would never realize my comment was deleted.\n\nAdditionally, if your comment is deleted before anyone responds, [deleted] or [removed] will not show up. It's like you never wrote anything at all, there isn't even evidence something had been removed. Again, example, [this is what I see when logged in](http://i.imgur.com/jMSDz0K.png). And [this is what I see when logged out, or what reddit at large sees](http://i.imgur.com/nAB42yX.png). In this situation, my comment was immediately deleted within seconds of posting. [I asked the mods why this was the case, and was told popular threads are set to \"remove all,\" and that because my comment broke their rules anyway, they would not reinstate it.](http://i.imgur.com/bnFnuDX.png) I appreciated the feedback from the mods, but if I had no idea this kind of deletion existed, I would have never even thought raise the issue with anyone, and my comment would simply have been like it never existed.\n\n***THE PROBLEM***\n\nThese surreptitious deletions are seldom, if ever, revealed to the people who have been targeted, and most people would never realize it. It is, at its core, deception. [In the same vein one poor user spent years \"shadowbanned\" without realizing it, due to the mechanics of a shadowban making it difficult for a user to realize they've been targeted](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/351buo/tifu_by_posting_for_three_years_and_just_now/), you too can have your comments indiscriminately targetted by a mod and never realize you've been silenced.\n\nWhy is this a problem, you might be asking yourself. Mods should have the ability to remove anything from their subreddit they don't like. And I agree with that. But the deceptive nature of the removal of comments is what bothers me. The fact that the user can still see their comments and never realize they've been tampered with is disturbing to me. It lacks transparency and perhaps encourages bad behavior by the mods. Being able to delete unfavorable comments without engaging does not help the community. \n\nSome subreddits are more heavy handed with their secretive censorship than others. As I showed above, /r/AskHistorians has a policy of secretly deleting all comments in threads they feel might attract \"unfavorable\" posts because they have become too popular. In this situation, most users would never know they've been deleted, or why. \n\nOther subs only use this tool to cull troll comments or spam.\n\n***THE SOLUTION***\n\nI have brought up the issue with the admins, and was told the secretive and deceptive nature of the deletion is necessary. Otherwise, spammers and trolls might be given some sort of advantaged when they know they've been deleted. I don't know if I agree with this. Submissions that are deleted in similar ways are often given an explanation by the AutoMod, for good reason. Users were upset they were essentially being tricked into believing their content simply wasn't good, rather than being told the reality that it was deleted.\n\nThe approach reddit took to deleted submissions needs to be applied to the deletion of comments. Users should be aware their comment had been removed, maybe an automod message or something similar. Ideally, the user should also be given an explanation for the removal, as that gives necessary feedback to correct bad behavior and encourages transparency among the mod teams. But, again, at the very least, the deception needs to stop. Even if its a troll or a spammer, having them realize they're being deleted does not give them an advantage. And even if it does, the fact this tool can be abused by duplicitous censors should at least raise an eyebrow.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I hope we can start a productive discussion about this very troubling aspect of the larger reddit community.",

Over the next few years Apple, Microsoft, and Google will be entering into spatial internet with Virtual and Augmented Reality devices and apps. Once the devices slim down, get ergonomic, and have high resolution, we'll see them hitting the mainstream, and with it, a spatial Reddit. My guess would be within 5 years.\n\n How would a spatial Reddit look like?\n\n My first thought was something completely exotic. Maybe Reddit could eventually be represented as a living and breathing virtual organism. Maybe a neon brain, the Reddit Hivemind, that you can explore in the comfort of your own room, and have it growing around you. Using your hands, you can swipe around and explore the most active parts of the mind (the evolved front page.) and see what individual humans are saying in each node. You can pick apart, 'upvote' and 'downvote' certain nodes, to strengthen the connections between them. The Reddit Hivemind could be visually represented as a group of neurons in a superorganism. Memes can be seen evolving in real time. Posts, comments, karma, everything, even user accounts can be represented similar to neurons firing in human brains. \n\n Spatial internet is coming sooner than most people think.

        "text": "For full disclosure: I am a moderator of /r/askhistorians and have recently written [something about recent effects of the election and US political discourse on our subreedit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5cpjki/meta_how_steadily_is_askhistorians_expanding_and/d9ygbmg/).\n\nHaving been made aware of this subreddit by one of the mods here, I decided to crosspost it here:\n\nOk, so to give a sort of state of the subreddit address:\n\n\nThree months ago [we hit half a million subscribers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4tng24/raskhistorians_has_just_hit_500000_subscribers_to/). Since then, we have gained an additional 34,248 subscribers, which averages to about 11,000 subscriptions per month.\n\n\nIt's hard to track subscriptions over a longer period of time with the tools provided by reddit but we recently had a discussion among the mods concerning traffic and /u/polybios has to that end compiled our traffic stats for the last 21 months:\n\n\nmonth | uniques | pageviews\n---------|----------|----------\nOctober | 849965 | 3046157\nSeptember | 851508 | 3080373\nAugust | 834234 | 3220940\nJuly | 827517 | 3433263\nJune | 861859 | 3364405\nMay | 919997 | 3864415\nApril | 1067563 | 4151194\nMarch | 1009819 | 3937443\nFebruary | 960409 | 3745492\nJanuary | 996364 | 4045804\nDecember 2015| 938279 | 3846543\nNovember 2015 | 886128 | 3617134\nOctober 2015 | 968708 | 4161369\nSeptember 2015 | 876385 | 3657345\nAugust 2015 | 885215 | 3957411\nJuly 2015 | 936069 | 4041760\nJune 2015 | 826107 | 3682569\nMay 2015 | 948375 | 4113199\nApril 2015 | 1028818 | 4569447\nMarch 2015 | 1014105 | 4371122\nFebruary 2015 | 914864 | 3938323\n\n\nSo, comparing this year to last year, while e.g. our best month, April, has seen an increase in both unique visitors as well as pageviews, on the whole comparing the traffic stats of the last 9 months to the same months last year shows that we’re on average down 2.5% in unique visitors and 12.5% in pageviews. The average for the last 4 months is down 8% in unique visitors and 19% in pageviews. In October 2016 we had 26% less pageviews than in October 2015. (again, thanks /u/polybios for having calculated that). Additionally, we are now at a point where for the first time in some time, we have fallen below 400 flaired users (due to inactivity for 6 months or deleted accounts).\n\n\nNaturally, we are not particularly happy about this and it has led to some intensive discussions regarding on how we can improve the content offered to our users and make the experience of our sub better.\n\n\nAt the same time, this phenomenon is not just confined to our subreddit. All of reddit has experienced a decline of about 25% unique viewers in the last year, from /r/funny to /r/askreddit. Other ask subs too have experienced an in some cases even more steep decline in uniques and views over the same period of time.\n\n\nWhile certainly not the sole reason regarding our sub and reddit as a whole, a major factor in all of this is, in our opinion, the change of culture on the site, especially related to the US election this year. Our relationship with reddit has always been an ambivalent one at best. While this site has offered us and continues to offer us and our mission to create a space for the historical education of the public a forum and huge audience, the corporate policies of reddit and the culture allowed to flourish as a result on this site has also stifled us in terms of outreach and credibility, especially when it comes to improving content with the help of people on the outside and when it comes to presenting our concept as one that can and should be taken seriously in the eyes of a wider public.\n\n\nThe fact that reddit is known among a wider public as a space which has [been a hub for child pornography](http://dailycaller.com/2011/09/30/anderson-cooper-vs-reddit/), the [dissemination of illegally obtained nude pictures](http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/staff-editorials/10749/reddit-broken-beyond-repair/), one of the [largest internet communities of racism](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/does-anything-go-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-racist-corner-of-reddit/277585/), and in recent months, the home of an [internet community that to many in the public represents one of the worst manifestations of the rhetoric and vitriol associated with the recent election](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/what-is-rthedonald-donald-trump-subreddit) is not only a problem for many of us personally, and for our image in the wider academic community, but also relate to the recent drop-off of users on the site and our sub as a whole.\n\n\nAs a primarily US American website, it is not just the image of this website and the number of users that have been affected by the above. It also had an effect on the culture of this site. Not only have we seen a rise in e.g. Holocaust Denial on our sub, we also notice that  the culture of discussion has suffered as a whole, as was only recently proven in [this thread on Melania Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5cg5yx/is_melania_trump_the_first_1st_generation/) in which we had to remove scores and scores of bigoted, borderline bigoted, and soapboxing comments. While this is to be expected with such charged issues, this one was particularly crass and hardly the only one recently. The most outrageous recent manifestation of such phenomena was one of our flairs suffering a six-month campaign of personal harassment by a group of racists who attacked them because of their topic of specialty. While this is indeed one of the dangers of the internet as a whole, the time period over which this took place and the intensity of said harassment is pretty unprecedented in our case.\n\n\nSo, on the whole, the election and the escalation of American political discourse has negatively impacted this site and by extension our subreddit in a way that's more radical than previous crises of reddit's image.\n\n\nWhere does this leave this sub and us as a community? As far as viable strategies go, it leaves us where any decline of users would have left us: at a place where we will continue to strive to improve quality and offer quality content on this sub. We are continuing to work on improving outreach and content of the podcast, which as far as I am aware has enjoyed steady growth in listeners;we are trying to – also after recent personnel changes – improve the twitter feed; and of course we are trying to take a more active role in recruiting more flairs in order to improve the question:answer ratio as well as offer interesting content to our users next to the questions asked in our regular features (where we might have something new for you soon too). We also are planning to have more and more high-profile AMAs in the time to come. While we can't promise anything yet, make sure to check periodically and the future might hold some amazing things on that front.\n\n\nFurthermore, we have been in contact with the admins recently in order to address the frequent complaint of the comment counter. While here too, we can't promise anything, know that as we said previously, we are trying to address the issue and there might be a way for that soon(TM).\n\n\nSo, in conclusion, the election and a variety of other things have affected our growth and reddit as a whole. Our strategy in dealing with that, is the strategy that can be considered tried and true vis a vis our approach as a whole: Keep content high in quality and aim to expand on more high-quality content. Find better ways for our users to find the most interesting content. And generate said interesting content via features and AMAs. I sincerely hope we succeed in this but on the whole, our community has been a great one from the first days of the sub to now, so I don't doubt that this might only be a bump in the road to further amazingness.\n",

Take for instance: /r/me_irl or /r/MaymayZone. Both subreddits appear to present \"memes\" from an ironic point of view, but at the same time, are still memes. \n\nIs this simply in the category of \"parody humor,\" or is it something else entirely? There are many subreddits, communities, and general culture that always seem to have a tinge of a bitter \"irony\" in their humor. I'm not quite sure how to put it into words - perhaps you understand my question and its point of view.",

Whatever, I then filter that subreddit (if it seems that's the entire purpose of said subreddit, not a random post).  My question is, why does it seem that about once a week I have a browsing session where I am filtering out every 10th post?  I read r/all/top at least once every day, and there always seems to be one day in a week I have to filter numerous subreddits whose sole purpose is porn.  The other days, nothing.  It just seems so weird.\n\nI hope that made sense.",

        "text": "The \"Known Rule Rule\" declares that any violation against a Reddit user of a subreddits special rules (rules not common to Reddit) can only be deemed to have occurred if the moderators of the subreddit have published the rule.\n\nIn other words, there can't be \"gotcha's\" that are not published ahead of time.  Enforcement of a rule that has never been reported or published would be similar to an ex post facto law - a law that can only known about to the violator after they have violated it.   \n\nUnder the Known Rule Rule, in the case wbere a user commits an egregious foul but one where no rule has been created by either Reddit or previously by the subreddit, the subreddit moderators should endeavor to record and publish the rule,  give the user stern warning, require that they respond, and/or only penalize them on any future occurrence. \n\nPlease recognize: It is a turn off for Reddit users when a sub decides to penalize them arbitrarily and without prior knowledge of a rule. This does not invite usage by would-be reddit users and does not grow the reddit community.\n\nAll penalities of any duration must state the duration in the penalty citation message and offer a hearing. It is also cruel to have a penalty of without known and definite duration.   Why is this?  Because human rights say that a person can not be deprived of a right without due process.  \n\nDue process must include certain aspects of evidence presentation and fact finding.  A freedom such as freedom of speech in early America was available where and when it counted - in the town square.  When town squares closed down and were replaced by shopping malls, our Constitutional freedom of speech - where and when it counted, became distressed.  Now it is practically non-existent.  Freedom of speech is now in the hands of moderators who are not judges or juries or prosecutors. The best we can do is to be fair and to preserve what due process would be and other rights so as to not unfairly treat a Redditor.  That way there will be future Redditors or at least they won't be discouraged by rules that are enforced but not published.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The Known Rule Rule is  named after its similarity to Josh Lyman/Bradley Whitfields \"Francis Scott Key Key\" from the TV series \"The West Wing\" because the alleged Key Key did not exist until after it was awarded to someone.\n\nI will be happy to include revisions and modifications and help with a recommendation if that becomes possible.\n\n-- Gonz\n\nBackground: The idea of this is to be fair to all users of a subreddit.  There are instances where penalties do exist for violations that simply are not published by a subreddit and users are punished without warning.\n\nTl;dr: Should all penalty rules be either published or penalties reversed and rules rescinded by subreddit moderators?\n\n\n",
