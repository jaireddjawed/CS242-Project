The trouble is, most of the titles that I can think of that involve important infrastructural projects/networks are novels, and often quite long ones. I'm running blank on short stories ... so, does anyone have any recommendations for short stories that might help my class bump up against a critical analysis of infrastructure? I've got road narratives pretty well covered, and I've got some Bridge poetry and some transit poetry to incorporate, but any short stories which focus on bridges, on waterworks, on communication networks, power grid, etc. would be appreciated.

Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.*\n\n*I am haunted by waters.*\n\n\nThe best I can come up with is two paragraphs earlier Maclean writes: \n\n*Now nearly all those I loved and did not understand when I was young are dead, but I still reach out to them.*\n\nIs he saying that time will uncover more meaning and he will understand those he loved more than he already does? What about the \"timeless raindrops\"?\n\n?\n\n\nI cannot believe this got down voted on this sub. Fuck whomever did that.",

I've posted in r/tipofmytongue too, but I think my chances might be better here.\n\n\nI believe it was a male poet who was mostly active in the first half of the twentieth century. He may have served in the First World War. He was talking about poetic form and its relation to (war) trauma. He felt that a traditional form helped him work through his emotions.\n\n\nThe quote amounted to something like this: 'Using free verse instead of traditional forms isn't necessarily a better way of expressing grief. The fact that Homer wrote about the death of [a character in the Iliad] in dactylic hexameter is not a disservice to the pain or grief. In fact, it helps to transform the grief and make sense of it. If I wrote about trauma in a direct and raw way like free verse, the poetry would be nothing but a confused howl.'\n\nI'd appreciate any help!",

Do my analyses belong to any \"school\" of literary theory, or are they just general \"interpretations\", or do they not count as interpretations at all?\n\nThanks!",

Some of the experienced soldiers and hardcore wargamers even state Hector should have seen an opportunity to destroy one of the Greek's major weapons by sending his army to  capture Achilles or have archers fire on Achilles during the famous duel, reasoning with Achilles's capture or death the Greeks both not only lose their best fighters and the leader of their best units, they also lose their biggest morale booster. They argue this would have been a big blow to Greek morale. At the bare minimal Hector should have avoided the duel since his ingenuity and leadership was so important in stopping the Greeks at that point in the story.\n\nInstead as we all know Hector chose to duel and quoting many of these critics \"died in vain\", indirectly leading to the fall of Troy.\n\nI am curious whats the reality of the situation if Hector decided to think like a modern military commander and get rid of Achilles on the spot? Was the decision to duel an objectively stupid one (as modern military analysis would criticize)? Or is there a deeper reason why Hector could not have simply avoided the duel by staying in his city? \n\nI mean many military officers, wargamers, history buffs, and well modern audiences cannot understand why \"stupid honor\" was worth making such a risky decision that would potentially lead tot he downfall of your country! Experts on Greek mythology what is your input on this? Are we modern people- especially military enthusiasts- failing to understand something about the Greek psyche of this time period?",

Last spring, I wrote a paper which explored philosophical connections between Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky and love and egoism. I loved writing this paper and approached one of my English professors about doing a whole independent study this upcoming semester with a very similar approach toward very similar subject matter. That is, I plan on analyzing Russian literature (specifically, writers/thinkers which are contemporaries of Dostoevsky and Dostoevsky himself) through a philosophical lens.\n\nTrouble is, she asked my to write up a tentative syllabus of what I want to do, and I don't know where to start--with either the literature side or the philosophy side. She said we'd definitely do Karmazov, which I'm already reading, and she also wanted to bring up existentialism and Nietzsche, for philosophy. Philosophically, I'm more interested in philosophy of emotion, philosophy of religion, punishment and ethics, and redemption. As for literature, I have not read any Russian literature outside of Notes and Karamazov. I'd also like to do Dostoevsky's The Idiot and Demons and Tolstoy (just don't know anything about Tolstoy!). With this in mind, if anyone has any reading/lesson suggestions for Russian literature and its various connections to philosophy and specific philosophers, that'd be great! And even if you have suggestions that have nothing to do with my interests, that would also be very helpful! Thanks!",

        "text": "William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the single greatest writer in the history of English literature. Reading his work, it's easy to see why people think that. However, it's baffling from a statistical perspective.\n\nEL as we know it today began, roughly speaking, with Geoffrey Chaucer (I'm sure that's a simplification, but it got us through A-level). If we ask what fraction of the authors since then predate Shakespeare, it has to be hardly any, because it's a fraction of the post-Chaucer history, and because since then the world population, fraction of it speaking English, and fraction of Anglophones who were literate have all skyrocketed. If all would-be-Greatest-Writer candidates had the same chance, it'd almost certainly be someone much more recent than the Bard.\n\nBut actually, early people were at two further disadvantages: the small market for their work was less of an incentive in an era when literacy was a path to other great jobs, and they had fewer giants' shoulders to stand on. The obvious advantage Shakespeare's successors had over him was that they could draw inspiration from his past work.\n\nSo given these facts, why hasn't anyone been able to dislodge Shakespeare, or at least make \"he's the best\" a more contentious standpoint? I'll offer my thoughts because r/literature discussions require the OP to do that, but I'm sure other people here will have much better ideas than mine (that's why I'm asking).\n\nWhen we call writers great, we're often talking about influence as much as or more than the \"quality\" (whatever that is) of their writing. When you're the ultimately most influential author from an early era, with very few contemporaries compared to the writing pool of today, you could easily have more reach than anyone thereafter. Unless everyone for the next century starts reshaping their writing style to learn from J K Rowling, his influence will be hard to beat.\n\nOr maybe he's the permanent pinnacle because he invented or reinvented so many different genres in his plays. (I remember one Reddit post explaining that what made him so great is that he mastered or even created so many different kinds of play.) In an era when there weren't that many examples of each to learn from, doing something innovative with each of them was a lot more achievable than it would be today, when our best living writers may manage that in one or two genres at best.",

For example:\n\nOedipus: Ah friend, still loyal, constant still and kind, / Thou carest for the blind.\n\n(...)\n\nCHORUS:  O thy despair well suits thy desperate case. / Would I had never looked upon thy face!\n\nSo, is the chorus supposed to be one man?

But she doesn't accept other information but her's, even though we cover same concepts. She gives us reading sheets, but I find it difficult to unlearn what I have read on those books. She recently gave me an F because I have given answers different from what she expected. She even stresses on 'how' to write (Autograph mistakes and punctuation) rather than 'what' is written. Any ideas on how to deal with it? Thank you so very much. ",

Could you spare a little time to contribute and let's build it together for a better academia :)\n\n**What's your way to pick an academic paper when facing a pile of literature??** By impact factor? By recommendations? Or…by feelings? Before trying, how do you know the paper in your hand trustworthy as your step stone? That’s why I was dreaming of a journal club where I can find comments on papers before examining it.\n\nWe are a small Danish team presenting a not-for-profit journal article hub \"[Crinetic](https://www.crinetic.com)\" which serves as a compass for academics, where you can find discussions and ratings of research articles, and more features fitting your needs. Just grab a \"DOI\" and input your comments, with simple steps and in minutes more readers will be benefited from your contribution. Of course, you are welcome to participate anonymously!\n\nIs time investment your biggest concern and hesitation for commenting a paper? We have noticed it and designed Crinetic with many innovations. We discarded the traditional commenting method and logic as all commenting likewise sites use. Crinetic introduces \"praise\" and \"criticism\" labeled comments, thus you are encouraged to express concisely and in a bullet way, and save bunch of precious time. By this, readers may also benefit from having an overview at a glance. Of course, you are more than welcome to upload a \"supporting material\" to back up your comments in your own format.\n\nFor instance, how about the comment goes like **\"I have repeated the experiment exactly as described 10 times and could not reproduce these results\"**? (Sorry I am an engineer, can only give this example...) It is a perfect example as a \"criticism\". It's short but it's the reflection from the effort you have put in the work. This kind of concise comment acts as an alarm to academia, even though not a conclusive and sound judgement which you might prepare more concrete materials as evidences. In fact, your short comment benefits academia and plays an important role as others, because basing on your quick input, novices can think twice before trying and people sharing the same experience can start discussing the hidden secrets. That's the scenario we are dreaming of :)\n\nAs a newly established database, we do need you to make it grow and prosper. If you have any feedback or would like to join the development, don't hesitate to PM here or on [Crinetic Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/crinetic/). We appreciate your participation, and of course, please help share this post and spread the word.\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/crinetic/) @ www.facebook.com/crinetic/\n\n[Official Page](https://www.crinetic.com) @ www.crinetic.com\n",

In order to understand how this network of forces is portrayed in his stories, I will examine how Hawthorne questions the moral perfection of institutional forces through portraying the duplicity and secret sin of elite figures, such as the crowd of pious church figures in “Young Goodman Brown”, and the titular minister in “The Minister’s Black Veil”. \n\n___________________________\n\nfor references, i am using F.O. Matthiessen's American Renaissance (historical background), and Hawthorne: A Life (biography). the project is exploratory, not argumentative, so i basically need to explore my question through a variety of lenses: biographical, historical/contextual, and critical (any school of criticism).\n\nhowever, when it comes to criticism, i am a little lost. my research skills need work. i am interested in papers that discuss how social forces are portrayed as 'dark', greedy, and ruthless in the three texts above, and also in papers that discuss how the individual is affected by those forces.\n\nwould love to hear your thoughts and suggestions.",

        "text": "Hi all. I'm in the first year of a two-year master's program in political theory. I'm studying at a none-too-prestigious school with a nevertheless strong/deep theory faculty, many of whom graduated from top programs.\n\nI'm looking into some theory programs, and I'm trying to understand the lay of the land in terms of program strength and ~reputation~. I know that program fit will depend largely on whom you work with and your research interests... My research interests include political theology, frankfurt school critical theory, and questions of sovereignty, especially concerning neoliberalism.\n\nIf you have any recommendations for me to check out, great. Hit me.\n\nOtherwise, I'm wondering what advice you can share with me about career prospects in the field. I know that most of you probably just snorted a bit, because, from what I can tell, theory is way too competitive for anyone's good. But I've gone through this song and dance when, long ago, I decided to apply to law school - \"it's only worth it if you can go to a top 10 school,\" etc., etc.\n\nIs there a maxim like that for political theory? Is it only 'safe' if you can get into school x or study with prof. y? I've been looking all over the web for resources on this, but haven't had much luck.\n\nThanks so much for your feedback! If there's anything else you think I should know, please don't hesitate to tell me.\n",

        "text": "I'll keep this short to save everyone's time: There's this guy i've met in a forum online who claims to be a really famous author. But since this is the internet, of course there's a big chance that he is lying. But the thing is that he does write really well, to the point that if he does indeed write professionally i'd love to read his books, so even if he's not too famous chances are he's some kind of professional writer or journalist.\n\nSo over the last couple years i've written down some (possibly made up) personal information he shared. Searching on my own i couldnt find any author that fits, so i've decided to see what the internet can tell me about him. Here's the information:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe lives in Texas, and is originally from Austin.\n\nHe is about 35 years old (34-36 just to be safe).\n\nHe writes fiction. Mostly fantasy, with the occasional mystery novel.\n\nHis first published book was turned down 18 or 19 times over the course of two years.\n\nHe's been publishing books for nearly two decades.\n\nHe \"Never sold out\" (his own words), meaning he never adapted any of his work for TV or movies, but claims to have written for TV under a pseudonym.\n\nHe has no children\n\nHe once claimed to retweet satires of his works because it helps them sell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have also talked to him on Discord a few times, so i can recognize his voice to confirm or disprove any suspects.",

He explained that the king had three daughters, two of which were wicked, and one was pure. The commentator referenced that this was much like Cinderella, and four other fairy tales that have the same archetype. The archetype being, three sisters, two are wicked and one is pure. My teacher wanted to find the names of these fairy tales, but to no avail. \n\nI've been researching what these 4 fairy tales could be, but I've only come across obscure stories that don't exactly fit the criteria. Do any of you happen to know the names of these fairy tales?\n\n",
