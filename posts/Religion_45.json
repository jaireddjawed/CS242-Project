        "author": "Aditeuri",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/9jljaw/what_would_a_truly_ecumenical_christian_biblical/",
        "text": "After a recent discussion in which the place of Scripture in my personal faith has came up, I have been looking into the composition of biblical canon which I'm familiar with and the canons of various groups within the Christian family and, as I'm sure many of us are aware, there is no coherent biblical canon for all Christians, and even within branches, there is not always cohesion. Furthermore, it's well documented that the canon differed over the centuries as well with diverse Christians including or excluding books as it fit their faith understanding.\n\nThat brings me to my original question: what would a truly ecumenical Christian biblical canon look like? I understand that this opens discussion up to a range of titles and may ultimately be arbitrary in its appearance were it to have one, but if we only consider the canons of modern Christian groups, as well as more-or-less authoritative ancient canons as found in translations or manuscripts such as the Septuagint or the Vulgate, how might such a biblical canon look like? I'm not saying this discussion should consider the array of theological reasonings why one group accepts or rejects a certain book or group of books, or whether it would even be plausible to physically compile such an ecumenical canon for all Christians, but rather which books would be included in a more ecumenical Christian canon.\n\nPersonally, my answer to this question tries to be as open as possible as to be considerate of diverse canons, but as cautious as possible as to avoid every and any ancient text being included. In doing so, I've identified **101 books** for what seems an ecumenical canon as seems reasonable to me:\n\n* The 24 books of the Tanakh, as arranged in the traditional 39-book Christian \"Old Testament\" format;\n* Included are the 7 books that Catholics call \"deuterocanonical\";\n* As well as the books of 1-2 Esdras, 3-4 Maccabees, and the Prayer of Manasseh found in some form in various Eastern canons, as well as in older Western canons which now classify them as \"apocrypha\";\n* The books of Enoch,  Jubilees, 3 Baruch prominently found in the modern Ethiopic canon, as well as the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs found in other Oriental canons;\n* The Psalms of Solomon and 2 Baruch, often found in the Septuagint and the Peshitta, respectively;\n* The traditional 27 books of the \"New Testament\";\n* And 1-2 Clement, the Epistle of Barnabas, the seven Epistles of Ignatius, the Epistle of Polycarp, the Martyrdom of Polycarp, the Epistle to Diognetus, the Shepherd of Hermas, the Didache, as well as 3 Corinthians and the Epistle to the Laodiceans, often found in early and some later Christian canons.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, without proselytizing or theologizing, either on the question, on my take on it, or both?",

        "text": " So I am a 53 year old husband and father. I have had moments of strong faith and moments of complete doubt. I'm talking of course about \"GOD\". I am like so many others. We want to believe, but God makes it so difficult to do so. He acts in mysterious ways and it's unfair. He made us to learn through our senses. We cannot see, feel, hear, taste or smell \"him\". Now some believers would argue that he does \"speak\" to us, but that is just nonsense and wishful thinking. To say he speaks to us through the bible is another \"cop-out\". The only answer I have ever heard from believers is that if God made himself \"known\" to us in a physical reality it would destroy our \"Faith\" and God wants us to choose him through faith as part of the free will he gave us to love him or reject him. That answer is the very basis for my \"lack\" of faith. If God appeared before me and spoke to me it would not stop me from having free will. I could still choose to reject him and unless he forced his powers upon me, I could still do whatever I wanted to do, which includes being human and remain sinful. What harm would it do to occasionally give us a sign or speak to us in quiet moments? What harm would it do to let us know that our loved ones who have died are OK. Why not give us comfort and peace in the knowing that they still exist....even if it is in a state that we are not capable of understanding. The older you get, the more loved ones you lose. That's just the reality that is forced upon us. If you are there God......why do you make it so difficult to believe? This post is mainly directed at believers. I'd like to hear your thoughts. ",

        "text": " The responses to my recent Rant regarding the three formative factors shaping my life have been extremely gratifying,   \nI feel it necessary to share further details about my perspective on life as MY clock winds down.\n\n I do this because the views I express reflect my lifelong philosophy that is rooted in a few beliefs which include: \n\n  \n1. I \tbelieve that the life of every human being has worth and dignity and is entitled to equal liberty, freedom, and justice. \n\n2. I \tbelieve in the motive force of love. Thus human relationships must consider the welfare of others, and that true love never seeks to hurt or destroy.\n\n 3.  I believe in the authority of reason and conscience and that humans are endowed with a never ending search for truth. \n\n4. I \tbelieve that humans have ever sought to find the source and meaning of life. From prescientific days of superstition. humans have created various dogmas and religions to explain and enhance \"the human condition.\"  Thus, all \"love based\" religious expressions must be encouraged as a way of seeking and providing ethical behavior. \n\n5. The \tindividual finds succor, support and encouragement from various \tgroups beginning with the family to the state. \n\n6. The democratic process provides means for members to share ideas, improve life \tconditions and equality under the law. Cooperative efforts recognize mutual dependence of people throughout the world.  \n\n7. The human experience is enhanced through cooperative endeavors.  Life for the individual is enhanced when there is a confirmation by one's peers, providing a critical platform for expression and mutual support. \n\n8. The work of all employees should be valued and that respect must be tangibly recognized by payment of a living wage.  \n\n  \n  This statement is my personal adaptation of a 10 point statement of policy developed by Dr. David Rankin, senior minister of the Fountain Street Church, Grand Rapids, Michigan 1982 – 1998 ordained is a Unitarian minister, David statement has been modified somewhat by the national Unitarian/Universalist church is a statement of their beliefs.     \n  As you can see, there is no mention of God. As a congregant of his Grand Rapids church I participated in a class in which the encouraged us to develop our own Definition of  the Word, God.   \n    \n  So that's a further background to my story. I think you will see it reflected in the way I look at life.  Next week or asap, I'll share my thoughts on the impact of “the sporting life” on children, the family structure and society. ",

        "text": "Hi Reddits :)\n\nFor some time I've been thinking about creating something for a better tomorrow. Technologies of ever more intelligent robots or more efficient computers are moving forward, but the progress in the development of the biological sphere is quiet, as if they were very slow and nothing to brag about. I would like to change this by creating a religious association based on more neglected areas that accompany us in everyday life, which is why the diversity of animals has come to the first fire.\n\nThe relationship would be based on slightly different principles than previous religions. Instead of basing on the written history of creating the world and the adventures of saints, our goal will be to learn about interesting issues of biology and chemistry in the world and to increase species diversity of animals and plants.  \nOn the one hand, new creatures will be used as domestic or breeding animals and on the other hand they will have the possibility of wild life in areas that are uninhabited by people (ie high mountains, wetlands, forests). In the case of a large population, one of the animals could also be used in a military way, thanks to which the number of dangerous means (chemical weapons, cartridges, bombs) that adversely affect us - humans - and the whole planet would decrease.\n\nOne of the first tasks undertaken by the association would be to build the first institute of biological engineering research in Poland, in which we would (or rather have been) scientists research on dt. above mentioned issues, from genetic diversity of animals starting.\n\nNow a few words about doctrine and statute.\n\n\\- Faith in other religions and the reception of sacraments connected with them will not be forbidden, the exception is the reception of ordinations,\n\n\\- a clergyman may be any person who knows the doctrine and is believer over 13 years of age,\n\n\\- Animals/Species created under the care of the compound are called **proteges** **(Podopiecznymi)** and killing them in the case of numbers below 1000 individuals deliberately results in an immediate loss of membership and (most probably) legal consequences\n\n\\- \\***Captain (Kapitan)** \\- the head of the association, the head of the clergy, has full power. It is not democratically elected.\n\n\\***Caretaker's Council (Rada Opiekunów)** \\- (from 3-5 members) elected by the Captain after consulting the General Meeting. It is not chosen democratically.\n\n\\***General Meeting (Zebranie Ogólne)** \\- consists of the Captain, Caretaker's Council, General Cet (looks below) and delegates. They counsel important matters regarding religious association, current research or ideas for research, and check appeals from being expelled from the association or taking the title (eg. General Cet) by the Caretaker's Council.\n\n\\***General Cet (Cet naczelny)** \\- there is one for each religious commune, some kind of superiors of the entire commune. They accept new believers, etc. Elected from the clergy of a given commune by democratic elections\n\n\\***Clergymen (Duchowni)** \\- Captain, Guardian and Cet are titles that give them additional rights, each of them is a Clergymen. A cleric without a title is the lowest degree, however, he is no longer just a lay faithful.\n\n\\***Delegates (Delegaci)** \\- lay faithful democratically elected once every three years in the amount of 1-2 per commune. They are part of the General Meeting, however, they do not have any profits besides being representatives of their commune. General Cet council may raise objections regarding the candidate's admission despite the majority of votes he receives, this matter is resolved by the Caretaker's Council.\n\n\\- In principle, apart from research institutes and meeting places, it is supposed to be a modern, partially based on the Internet community. Without historical buildings, with a clear and simple system of joining a relationship and easy contact with Cets, Caretaker's or Captain.\n\nI have just presented a general outline of the idea. I think that this could develop on a quite nice scale, maybe it would not be the second Christianity but after some time probably several thousand people would like to support the project :) In the event that we managed to create some animals of a new species, adapt them to life among people and priority will be given to the faithful, also expectation can bring harvest ;)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone had any questions, was not sure about specific issues or simply omitted something, I encourage you to discuss below, I will also listen to interesting advice.

        "text": "I know there are many religions (I am thinking specifically of Catholicism here) that place limits on birth control methods that can be used. My understanding was always that they did this because they viewed children as gifts from God, and therefore did not want to limit the number of children God gave them. \n\nHowever, I am a bit confused about the use of birth control methods like Natural Family Planning. In this method a woman tracks her cycle to determine when she is fertile, and then plans to only have unprotected sex with her husband during times when she isn’t fertile, thereby largely reducing her chance of pregnancy. How is this any different than the use of a barrier method, like condoms? In both scenarios steps are taken to limit the chances that a sexual experience will lead to children, without impeding the release of an egg or disrupting anything that could potentially be a fetus. \n\nI would love to hear from someone who practices this method of birth control or who understands the ideology behind it. To be clear I am not at all trying to come from a place of judgment, I would just like to better understand this aspect of some faith communities. ",
