GOW R is especially guilty of wasting the player's time with countless cliffs to climb and tight corridors that are just hidden loading screens.  I'd rather them just cut away to a cutscene, or even a loading screen.",

Rolls Royce is offering 1000 NFTs for the first 1000 people to go on [https://rollsroycenfts.org/](http://37.187.223.72/redirect?url=noref.io%2F%23https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FoYq6SpZiCe) and claim theirs for 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝗲 to gather more attention.\n\nThe luxury brand has one of the most famous car models like the Rolls Royce Ghost, Phantom and Cullinan and each of them have their own version of a NFT, varying in color and manufacture year. The Token runs on the Ethereum chain like any other NFT.\n\nI don't think you get to miss in terms of 𝗡𝗙𝗧 when it's Rolls Royce, because all their car models are simply amazing and the NFTs will consequently be worth a ton of money.\n\nI was very lucky to get my black Rolls Royce Phantom 2020 NFT, as I am sure it will be very expensive.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zk5vqg/why_is_objectively_used_so_much_when_referring_to/",
        "text": "I've already submitted such a similar post to r/Games and r/AskGames. Go to [these]() [links]() if you want to see those perspectives.\n\nBefore delving deep into this topic, it’s important that I define “objectively” and \"subjectively\" and how I’m going to be using it throughout this post.\n\n#Objective: uninfluenced by personal opinions or standards set by people; concerning only facts\n\n#Subjective: influenced by personal opinions or standards set by people; opinionated\n\nSo based on these definition alone, I think you can now understand why I take umbrage with common use of this term. Usually when I see conversations about any sort of art form, someone will say that \"such-and-such\" game is \"objectively\" bad or worse than another. The issue here is that saying something is \"bad\" or \"good\" (whether it measures how enjoyable something is or how much quality there is) inherently falls into subjective territory (or \"intersubjective\", as I'll bring up later) since base definitions of bad and good reference quality (which does conform to agreed-upon standards, but that still only counts as \"intersubjective\" at most).\n\nNow this is different from using facts to back up an opinion. To speak about competitive contexts, players will bring up specific measurable attributes (like speed compared to power, hurtbox size, tournament results, etc.) to back up why they think a character is good or bad. From there, they conclude that the character is an \"objectively\" good or bad character. The issue I have is that specific changes in a metagame may favour specific attributes over others, leading to characters initially considered worse to be better than initially thought (or even better than characters ranked higher than them in traditional tier lists). This doesn't change the attributes themselves, and they remain objective, but how good these characters are tend to be based on how people revolutionize the metagame and how these attributes match into it, thus making the conclusion still a subjective one.\n\nHowever, there is one final term I'd like to bring up that I alluded to paragraphs ago, and that's \"intersubjective.\" I would define it as such:\n\n#Intersubjective: shared between multiple conscious minds rather than just one's own perspective\n\n[In a post I submitted to r/Games years ago, I surmised that the way people use \"objectively\" in these kinds of discussions is done as a placeholder for \"intersubjectively.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/jygm7i/im_not_quite_sure_why_some_people_may_be_so/) Am I still right or am I misinformed? Do other people define the words above differently from how I do?\n\nAs a potential future reviewer, this really grinds my gears, as you can probably tell.\n\nBTW, why do people care so much about trying to create an \"objective\" review or just being the most factual when that's simply an unrealistic ideal? I struggle to fathom this.",

        "text": "So, I would call myself a fairly avid fan of action games, particularly “characters action”. Y'know our DMCs, Bayonettas, Ninja Gaidens etc etc. A huge part of these games is awareness and to be aware of the battlefield within the game we primarily use our sense of sight, our eyes. Wow I know enlightening, I just blew your mind, but bear with me here. So logic would dictate **not being able to fucking see the enemies is a bad thing**.  Usually\n\n***Clarity of information***\n\nLet me use a popular example and criticism. Souls games particularly Elden Ring. Oh do they love their big terrorfying behemoths. It's a cool concept I must admit. But you know what isn't fun? Being forced to stare at their toe nail and pray and guess what move they're preparing offscreen (the top 4/5ths of their fucking body). Hope you can tell the audio cue difference of saw Cleric Beast going “REEOOOAAUGHGH” and him going “BLARGHAGRGH”. Hope you can differentiate Fire Giant or whatever his name going “HRRNGH” and him going “GRNNGH”. Especially when a choir is popping off in the music\n\nLet's go to another game, Wonderful 101. For some reason the default camera is zoomed into ridiculous amounts considering  **we need to fit 100 controlled player characters on screen**. Usually they're zoomed out enough but on ocassions for some fucking reason the camera will just hyper focus on a corner of the battlefield (the one you're at) and now when you have tons of different colors and effects going around, the enemies are fairly fucking big which can block the screen and can have some pretty fuckign fast attacks, it can be a nightmare sometimes. Not to mention when their can be several enemies offscreen shooting things at you.\n\nAnyway my assertion is hyper focusing on one spot deprives us of vital information we need to defend ourselves and also can lead to a lack of clarity from the visuals about what's actually occurring.\n\n***Audio Cues as supplements***\n\nSo you might be thinking “it can be fine because you can hear an attack coming from offscreen and dodge”. Yes that can be true. For example DMC 3's Prides and Sloths and Lusts have very distinct battle cries for their limited movesets. Wonderful 101's cannon enemies make a bowstring noise to let you know they're about to shoot. MGR's Gekkos fucking moo before they try to melee/charge.\n\nBut even with great audio cues there's a often overlooked problem. Audio mixing. At least that's what I think it's called when you have several contrasting audios competing for clarity I'm not expert but I hope you'll get my point.\n\nFor example let me use my beloved DMC 3 as an example for it's shortcoming. Sure yeah a Slot witll go “YEOW” before it swings from offscreen. But **it can hard to hear** the “YEOW” between Dante screaming “HUH HAH HUH YEAH BREAKDOWN WOOOOOOHOOOO”” and the BGM blaring “THE FLINCH IN YOUR EYE CALLS YOUR BLUFF”\n\nOr let me use the new God of War for example. Now a disclaimer **I haven't played this game personally, only watched a friend play so feel free to disqualify this particular point if I'm off base**. So Kratos is swinging grunting pretty loud , the music's blaring and then Atreus will go“Father behind you!”. This in my opinion is a pretty shitty audio cue. It doesn't denote which **specific** type of attack is coming and if you're using subtitles it can distract you taking your eyes of the action which I don't need to tell you what that can lead to\n\n***Some final thoughts and my conclusion***\n\nI just fuckign wished more action games would just zoom the camera out more. I'm doing a Bloodborne playthrough and though I can get why sometimes they zoom in (enclosed spaces) it can get pretty claustrophobic and annoying. Especially if I can see we got room to zoom out\n\nThat's another thing ,I understand why a certain distance of closeness is needed to see your character. So that we know what the fuck we're doing and so we can confirm our inputs are coming through. But if the controls are good and our character has good consistent audio cues for our inputs like Dante going “BLAST/LIFT OFF” with a Rebellion launcher we don't need to see our character as much. It's more important usually to see the enemy.\n\nEspecially if the game likes to make “rooms” (enclosed sectioned off arenas) to fight in, there's usually no reason to not show the entire room\n\nThere's also workarounds like DMC heavily decreasing enemy agression (but not completely negating it) if the enemy's offscreen. Or good clear audio cues with enough time to react for enemies offscreen\n\nAnyway those are some thoughts I've been having on close cameras in action games. Please join in with examples if you have the same frustrations or just some thoughts to spur the discussion down below",

        "text": "So I just finished – and I mean *finished* *finished* \\- **Nier Replicant ver.122-lotsa numbers**, and while it’s not a perfect game by any stretch, it is a uniquely memorable and affecting experience. It reminded me of an idea I had after playing Nier Automata several years ago. Automata, at the very end, has the characters address the player directly and thank them for playing. Replicant does something similar via a bonus extra in the main menu, which, frankly, brought a tear to my eye. It’s something that Yoko Taro does quite often – openly acknowledging the player and their contribution to the story. It comes, I believe, from the same place as the ability, in Automata, to remove your character’s OS chip and die from that at any point in the game while getting the corresponding ending. There’s an understanding that a game is much more of a dialogue between the creator and the player than any other medium. It’s also something that Hideo Kojima goes to great lengths to acknowledge in MGS V especially, but not solely. Despite Kojima’s penchant for imitating cinema, his games are often some of the most player-driven on the market.\n\nAnd I believe it’s something that so many developers fail to recognize, including many so-called “auteurs” occupying a niche similar to Taro's and Kojima’s. With many games – something like The Last of Us comes to mind – there’s often this tension, this sense that the developer is like an older kid letting you play with their toys but hovering right above your shoulder making sure you don’t play with them wrong. And if they can’t make sure that you play the game exactly as intended, they can separate the story bits from the gameplay bits so that at least you don’t mess up their precious narrative.\n\nSome of the most impressive indies I’ve played in recent years, including **Pathologic** and everything by **Daniel Mullins**, also share the quality of always keeping the player’s role in mind, as well as often addressing them directly. I’m not saying that, to be good, a game has to specifically nod and wink at you through a hole in the fourth wall. There’s, after all, a little indie gem called Dark Souls that pretty much follows the same player-centric philosophy without openly flirting with you. But you can still see that it’s pretty much the same school of thought that’s quite different from the one inherent to your Uncharteds and Gods of Wars (all stellar games in their own right, of course, *of course*). Ultimately, I think I just wish that more developers spent more time thinking about what makes a game a game and less time worrying about whether all that pesky gameplay would ruin whatever 3D-animated movie they actually want to make.  \n\n\nAlso, yeah, Nier is pretty amazing. But, for the love of all that is holy, get a podcast ready for playthroughs C and D and the beginning of E. Your sanity will thank you.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zjbbsw/can_a_car_drivinghorror_game_be_scary/",
        "text": "Ahoy there!\n\nWhat I mean by the title is a game, where you're only sitting in your car and never leave it.\n\nSince people are creative and even managed to turn normal jobs into horror settings, I'm wondering: why not one where you're just sitting behind a wheel and driving?\n\nMost of those games rely on having an antagonist you often have no hope of fighting against and you either die (bad ending), escape but the monster/killer/whatever is still on the lose (neutral ending), or defeat them (good ending) and live happily ever after - or not, depending on the game's tone. What do they have in common? You're on foot, mostly without a weapon.\n\nNow, with a horror game set in your own car, I get the complications of making it terrifying. Namely, well, you're sitting in a metal cage weighing tons, with strong lights, can just get the hell out of there, and use your car as a very potent weapon when needed. Bonus points if you have a truck. Unless you are somehow forced to get out or your antagonist - if there even is one - is some supernatural entity who can manipulate your car, or outright gets on your backseat unnoticed for some reason, you're unstoppable. Thus, you have to devise a way to remove the protection your ride offers without making the player character act like an idiot. For instance, when he forgets to lock the doors.\n\nSo far, I only know of two \"true\" (meaning, they try to scare you) car driving-horror games:\n\n**Beware (Demo)**\n\nSet in an unnamed Eastern European country, you're exploring a desolate world in your trusty sedan with only very few inhabitants, weird locations, and hostile, probably not-human men who chase you in small cars when they spot you. While the atmosphere is truly unsettling and sometimes outright disturbing, the horror factor is severely hampered by the fact that the only danger comes from your pursuers. As long as you don't crash or they run you off the road, you can't die and so far your car is indestructible.\n\n**Dead End Road**\n\nAfter messing with the occult, you now have a demon on your tail, and must get to the other end of the British (right-hand-drive) countryside to an old woman in the hopes of ending this nightmare. On your way, you must evade animals, trash, jaywalkers, and oncoming traffic on both (!) sides of the road and have to stop in different towns to purchase items and service/upgrade your car. All while the demon attempts to distract you with hallucinations to get you to crash, or summons ghosts on your backseat who will kill you if you don't turn the light off. Now, this is the closest to car driving-horror, but it doesn't come without problems that turn the initial horror into annoyance and frustration. The jumpscares become quickly repetitive and happen every few seconds if you're unlucky, and the game's difficulty is artificially ramped up by reducing your headlight's range and making traffic suicidal. Also, for some reason, other cars don't illuminate the road themselves, so you can only see them once they are in your headlights. Likely when you're about to crash head-on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith both closest contenders not really scary, or becoming frustrating and annoying rather quickly, I'm asking: Is a terrifying car driving-horror game possible? What would it need for that? Can it work without forcing the player to leave their ride? What could be a suitable setting? Is an antagonist a must? Jumpscare-Simulator or not?\n\nTo be honest, I don't know and am inclined to believe that it isn't. A car is just an extremely powerful asset, and a threat needs to be specifically constructed to counter it. And if you must leave it at some point, would it still be car driving-horror?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReally grateful for your insights on this, maybe an indie-developer could take something from it? :)",

        "text": "I love Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence. One of my favorite games. It's primarily an action game with sneaking elements. I've played it on the hardest difficulty and had to learn how to use the tools the game gives you. Watching, observing enemy routes. learning how to take people out without being seen. On that difficulty, if you get spotted, it's game over.\n\nMy friend streamed it. He played on one of the lower difficulties. He ran and gunned through the whole. He had no idea how to use CQC. He doesn't bother with the camo. He doesn't care about getting alerts so he never learned how to properly sneak. There are some interesting tools that he never touched and he's someone who will never play the game again. The game doesn't force you on lower difficulties to learn how to use everything. Some bosses, he brute forced his way through. He would heal himself and not learn how to effectively dodge and take down the boss.\n\nThis isn't isolated to MGS3. In other games,  people play against bosses, don't learn them, brute force their way through with heals. Or in RPGs, grinding. RE2 Remake, there's a tactic for dodging zombies where you go in, you force them to lunge, then you run away in the opposite direction. I see people play the game, get bit all the time. They run out of resources from healing but they never put two and two together that they need to learn change their tactics.\n\nTheir way of playing is as valid as any. I don't want people to have learn how to do Mario 64 speedrun tactics on a basic playthrough. My problem is you can complete games without basic understanding of their systems.\n\n My opinion isn't that all games need to be harder. I think it's possible on easy and normal to get people to use other tools. I wish more games got people to learn more than they currently do so people can have a more clear picture on what the game has to offer. It bums me out that my friend has this picture of MGS3 that's so incomplete.\n\nDo you think think if it's a big flaw in a game if you can complete it without learning how to use a good amount of what it has to offer?",

        "text": "I've noticed a trend over the past 10 years or so that many games seemingly don't have a full tutorial in the game, where explanations for several more advanced mechanics are just straight up missing from the game. In the past these would be included in the manual, but since those no longer exist the developers and publishers have opted to just not have these in the tutorial, leaving the burden to fall upon the shoulders of indepent creators.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen playing several games I felt myself entirely lost at several points, requiring me to look up guides. Not just the standard \"I can't get past this puzzle\" type of stuck, but while playing the Dark Souls after leaving the tutorial area I walked forwards. I didn't understand that this takes you to a very difficult area, and a friend needed to tell me that I was actually supposed to walk around to an area I'd normally think contains an easter egg rather than the intended main route. While playing the third game I got through the first two levels and beat the bosses without much (relative) difficulty, but in the third I found a boss room entirely unaware that this time I was not supposed to face a boss but rather make my way through a puzzle further through the level than I had progressed. Maybe these are problems only I've faced, but regardless it feels like these games rely heavily upon online guides simply to progress in the way that's intended. (before anyone accuses me of salt or anything, I actually enjoy DS a decent bit, it's just moments like this that feel like they were designed by a blind monkey)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother similar topic I feel falls in the same general thought I don't think I've seen discussed before is online games that are \"better with friends\". Often I've downloaded a game at the suggestion of a friend and felt it lacking, but they'd just retort that it's enjoyable with people you know. While I don't dispute that games are better played with a discord call full of people you know, I'd posit that a game should still be entirely enjoyable with randoms or even just on your own. I should be able to queue into a match on my own and leave feeling satisfied, regardless of who I played with. Any game can be made fun with friends, some of the best memories I have with games involved my friends and games that most people consider mediocre at best. The enjoyable part isn't the game but rather the fact that I'm with someone I enjoy being with.",

And on the other hand there is CoD itself, a $60 game that releases annually with little gameplay improvements between releases. My question is why is there no middle ground between these two types? Something like a $20-25 multiplayer CoD-like that is updated regularly without monetization that affects gameplay. We know that multiplayer shooters at that price range can succeed, even when their genre is a lot more niche than CoD (Hunt Showdown, Insurgency etc.) And from what I know there are a lot of CoD players who are constantly looking for alternatives to CoD. So why are there no cheap, high quality CoD-like?",

I guess I'm showing my age here, I just believe it is a more satisfying way to play as Kratos, it's a system that just requires a human being's skill and a controller, something the newer games hamper with it's gear system. If you like the new combat over the older games, I'm not going to judge you, I just think games like Dark Souls might have influenced some games too much, but then again there's also some The Last of Us in Norse God of War. \n\nI feel like I'm going over what most have talked about before\n\n* Close camera angle obstructing view\n* no jump button(no air based combos)\n* Runic attacks are cool, but during an animation you can take damage and planning them is unpredictable\n* GMGOW has the gimmick where enemies level up during a fight, I think this is more of a nuisance than providing an actual challenge\n\nI can't trash certain games with the close camera angle, The Last of Us did it right, but you can argue it's a survival game and the shooting and movement is mean to be slow, unlike Uncharted where you're agile and the game is designed around mowing down enemies, so for some games it's an artistic choice that works, I don't think it fits God of War.",

So I thought I would sell my PC (R3 3100, RX580, spare RX460, 1TB SSD, 16GB RAM) and buy Xbox series S and buy post-leasing laptop in order to do school stuff (many programs wouldnt work on chromebook OS). This also would help me with internet detox I somewhat need rn. What do you think of that? I know it's weird take but it is what it is, I know I would have to say byebye to fivem, csgo and ets2 for some time cuz the laptop would be rather cheap but I think I can handle it. One more thing is that I am stationary for next 2,5 years, after that uni/college and living in probably academic so I would go for simple daily or gaming laptop after that.",

        "text": "A common complaint I see on Reddit about games with many dlcs, like paradox games or the sims, is that the ‘true’ cost of the game is the base game and all dlcs, and that this cost is prohibitively expensive and therefore the game is not worth purchasing.\n\nI find this line of thinking strange. I have many issues with dlc strategy and pricing, but this seems to be a misunderstanding of dlc.\n\nDlc isn’t something that needs to be purchased at the same time as the base game and often times this should be avoided. \n\nA lot of Dlc is really for extending the life of a game, once you’ve played through the base game and want to experience something new. It’s best purchased gradually. You often only need 1 piece of dlc breath new life into a game. If you keep coming back to the game, then it’s worth it to keep investing more in dlc.\n\nFor example, in the Sims 4, each expansion can sustain a new playthrough of the game. Buying them all at the start would do yourself a disservice and lose the benefit that slowly adding new features give. Additionally, not all are worth grabbing depending on your playstyle. Grab things that will enhance your game and ignore the others. \n\nGames like the Sims, Crusader Kings, Anno, and Rimworld have large enough base games worth playing themselves. Don’t worry about their dlc, until you’ve gotten your money’s worth and want more.",

        "text": "The biggest example is Bethesda games like Fallout and Elder Scrolls, maybe it's that these people are the minority and just the loudest, or maybe they actually are the majority? What I'm talking about is all these people who swear off the main story and just do other stuff, or no quests and just kind of exist. I'm in this group, and I wonder why devs/pubs don't offer more in this. I don't like most questlines in games, I really just prefer to do my own thing at my own pace. I especially dislike questlines which lock away the rest of the game, like GTA V, you should be able to do your own thing. But you can't, all the guns, gun accessories, properties, etc are locked away behind main missions. Hell, you can't even make money to any real extent without doing at least a heist. RDR 2 shares these problems too. So if people want it, why not sell it to them?\n\nA good example goes back to Bethesda, I want to play Fallout 76 but it's literally the only online game I'm remotely interested in. But they won't sell me the game so I can enjoy it as it is, I nave to pay for online and deal with others online, or pay even more to play privately. There are plenty of Fallout fans who would prefer to play offline, I know I'm not alone here. But this could be a bad example because Bethesda games have a thriving mod scene and they probably are afraid people would just play free mod added content. Because I was next going to question why companies don't offer the story as DLC? If you could buy an open world minus story, then wouldn't they benefit from the upsell of you eventually purchasing the storylines? And then they could sell to both camps of fans? Yeah, some are probably reaching for pitchforks now as I shouldn't dare give them such an evil exploitable idea...\n\nIt just seems to me that there are a lot of things companies could be capitalizing on where they're just leaving money on the table. Slapping together an interesting world with good mechanics and fun things to do sounds a whole lot cheaper and easier than writing questlines, making cutscenes, hiring actors, doing mocap, etc. And people would buy them, so why don't they sell them? If Fallout 76 released annually or semi-annually as just a new map to enjoy offline while we wait forever for the next numbered installment people would buy it. Not to mention just handing the keys to another dev team to make an installment \"in the meantime\" like New Vegas. If they pumped out another fallout every 18 months like New Vegas was unbelievably made in people would buy jt, in droves! Now 18 months is ridiculous, especially for current development. But imagine if New Vegas had no main story, ok maybe that's not fair, there's a ton of great side quests. Let's say no quests, just the improvements and new world. So things like hardcore mode, iron sights, soundtrack, weapons, armor, etc. People would buy that, or am I wrong here? Let's say the main and side quests are purchasable later as DLCs packs and the open world itself is reasonably priced and released first. Is this something enough people would be on board with that the industry could make a shift toward it or nah?",

        "text": "I didn't know where else to type this, but I've never felt so compelled to share my thoughts on a demo before. I want word of this game to spread, it needs to be delayed, there is a glimmer of potential here, but in the game's current state, it's 100% fucked. \n\n\nImmediately upon booting the game up, the first thing you will notice is, it's not a particularly good looking game. Is it the ugliest game ever? No. But it definitely looks like a mid-gen PS4 game at best, the lighting is really off, the environments look overly bright and washed out, but the character models seem extremely contrasty and dark, it's almost like the global lighting doesn't even work. The aliasing and shimmering of the foliage is really bad like there's a sharpening filter on everything, and there's quite a lot of thin lined grass and plants on the ground. It's just not incredibly attractive, even on quality or ray-tracing mode. At least the game is (mostly) stable, unless you're using one of the flashier spells like the flame circle which will cause a noticeable frame rate dip (as well as you not being able to see shit). \n\n\nAs soon as I started the tutorial and started getting walked through the combat, I could immediately tell the controls were convoluted and janky, the amount of slow-mo sub-menu navigation you have to do to swap spells mid combat is egregious, I feel like games have already done stuff similar to this in a far more intuitive system. There's absolutely no way to fast swap or cycle abilities, you constantly have to open these spell wheels to change your attacks as you wait for cool downs. \n\n\nFor some reason you seemingly can't have a melee attack and ranged abilities at the same time, so you have to menu swap to go from one ability set to another just to get melee attacks, games like Horizon or InFamous at least give you a melee ability that's always accessible,despite being a game focused on ranged attacks. This is a really bizarre choice when you just want to attack something up close quickly, but no you have to slow down the combat and swap to your melee attacks, it's just not very smooth. \n\n\nThe enemy AI is insanely braindead, it feels like you're playing a Dynasty Warriors games and every enemy is one of those generic soldiers that just stands around you in a circle and does nothing. They can barely track you, they sometimes won't attack at all, they will just stand there and whiff attacks 5 feet in front of you. They forget you exist if you leave their line of sight sometimes. It's bad, real bad. \n\nThe entirety of the demo, literally the entire time you're playing. There's some PS2 era sounding Harry Potter music playing non-stop. It sounds like something you'd hear on an amusement park ride at Disneyland. It feels like something you'd expect from a kids fantasy game made 20 years ago, it doesn't fit at all, it's incredibly bizarre. Even the menu music was terrible to be honest, some strange mashup of hip hop and fantasy music, that just does not sound good at all. Oh yeah and you have two characters talking the entire time you're fighting, with cringe DmC level dialogue featuring pointless excessive cursing and bad banter, not sure what they were thinking with that one.\n\n\nThe UI is trash too. The text is too fucking tiny, felt like text for ants, no accessibility option changed this. There's a weird fisheye bobbing effect on all the menus that looks like crap, and it's all a bit shitty to navigate. \n\n\nI'm 100% convinced this game will flop, and I'm surprised they had the courage to put out that demo, because the game needs way more time in the oven, the fact that the experience is stable might fool you into thinking it's a finished product, but it really doesn't feel like it is in practice. I've never come out of a demo, so sure of a games inevitable failure, I hope they delay this game. \n\n\nGod damn.",

I know there are a lot out there who will say HFW or possibly GoW:R, but I think that MWII, from a pure realism standpoint, is the best. That being said, HFW is probably the best from an aesthetic standpoint. Elden Ring is quite striking as well. I also think that Fortnite's new update is pretty impressive, even if the game is... well... Fortnite. Unreal Engine 5 seems promising but is very underutilized at the moment. I am excited to see what other devs can do with it. I think that Nanite seems very promising. I also really have been impressed by what some indie teams are doing, I thought Stray was quite impressive. Lego Star Wars had some impressive environments, and the little details on the plastics went a long way. As for worst graphics (in terms of more high-profile releases), I'd have to nominate Pokemon S/V. That game is concerning on almost every front, and I think they really need to get their stuff together.",

        "text": "As huge fan of the original **KoH**(I must have spent thousands of hours playing it alone or with friends, I listened its music thousand of times, it fueled my interest in history etc...) I am both disappointed and elated, that they did not change all that much and this feels more like a remaster or remake. But I had fun, there is no doubt about that. \n\nFirst although my memory of **KoHI** is not so fresh(Last time I played it was 3-4 years a go) and I haven't still fully explored KoH2(I played about 15hrs, I could not stop myself), I can already see some *downgrades*, like there is no (models on the map of)ports, the battles are somehow even more simplified, no camps, morale seems to play a lesser lore(or it doesn't exist)... I am sure there is more that I haven't noticed.\n\nThe other bigger problem is that the game like most of these strategy sequels somehow looks worse! At least the campaign map is so so compared to the original, but the battles are uglier*. The 2d gave the game a certain look and beauty, I remember as a kid going out of my way just to see how a certain unit looks on the map, with KoH2 I quickly lost that interest, cause the truth was, all units looked hideous, they looked so \"**mobile game**\", I am not a visual designer and I am sure someone who understand this stuff better can put it into words, but I just cannot stand seeing the units in KoH2, especially moving, it just looks like some free mobile game. This is not about \"graphics\" its about the visual direction, obviously they cannot have brand new graphics, the issue at hand is something else, cause KoH2 has better graphics than KoH1, but KoH1 looks better, it has a certain atmosphere and style that I don't get with any other game. \n\nNow my major problem is that since KoHI we've had SO MANY STRATEGY GAMES. I am **NOT SAYING THAT KOH SHOULD HAVE JUST COPIED TRENDS**, in fact I applaud them for it, what bothers me is that nothing of substance has been added to the game. Seriously, are you telling me that nothing from Mount&amp;Blade, Crusader Kings, Total War etc... could have been in some way adapted to KoH2? I was so disappointed to see the immortal knights(and the problems with experience/skills that brings...), the shortsighted set limit of knights, the simpleton insulting battles, the stiff diplomacy, the copy-pasted kingdoms, the start from 0 militaries(destroys all immersion when kingdoms of Europe have only peasants at the start, absurd...)...\n\nLet me give you an example, you have Total War, but wait, I know what you are expecting me to talk about, \"**MUH BATTLES!**\". \n\nOh no, the *diplomacy*! You see in KoH when you want to make sign some kind of treaty with another faction, you can't do anything except just ask the faction you want to deal with, for that treaty. That's it, if they say no, its a no, or they give you a counter offer, to which you can only answer with yes or no... But in Total War, depending on the game you can open the diplomacy menu and then make a bunch of deals, in most cases you are gonna try to offer/demand a specific amount of money, just enough to get a certain deal. But that deal can be really simple or really complicated. I mean c'mon, the Total War franchise should not make the diplomacy of a Grand Strategy look simpleton, that is hilarious... \n\nThe games I named, have already provided some venues or ideas for KoH2 to improve, but the developers just dismissed them and stubbornly added only minor things. But I know that disingenuous people are gonna respond this \"**LOL YOU JUST WANT KOH TO TURN INTO X FRANCHISE!!!**\" I just feel like there is fine line between jumping on trends and seeing what works and integrating it into your game, lots of games were made this way. \n\nAt the end of the day, I don't see myself playing this for much more, you just can't cause I already have had belly full of KoH for a lifetime, and I hope some DLC might or patches might give some big additions, but I am really skeptical, I am skeptical that this game will sell well, it is waaaay overpriced for a sequel of an obscure strategy game from **2004**, and there seems to be next to 0 buzz for it on the internet. The marketing was very confusing([what is a person supposed to make of this, if they haven't played KoHI?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjuuNM7-jVc], and if they did, the trailer again is really not saying much).\n\n\nThat said KoH2 seems to be a better game than KoH1(in most but not all respects) and its just easier to run, so for someone who knows not much about KoH, this might be a better starting point.  \n\n**P.S.** The soundtrack seems to be very good but not as good as KoH1, which was very hard to top, so I am fine with it. \n\n\n* Wtf is the deal with these strategy games who's sequels look worse and mobile gamey? Stronghold and Age of Empires (IV) being the worst example, even Total War with 3k and Troy has stepped a bit into this territory (more due to the UI). I swear late 90's early 2000s' strategies look either better or the same as strategy games released after like 2006.",

Despite being aware of the numerous problems with the series and the individual games themselves, I still play them and I still enjoy them and I still act like a total nerd and fanboy at all the moments when I'm supposed to and I still recommend them to friends (when they're not horrible).  \n\nAnd so, when the Elite Four representative conducted a pre-battle interview, I answered all the questions \"correctly\" because I'm basically a Poke-Simp.\n\n**She says: \"Why are you here?\"**\n\n**I say: \"To become the champion\"**\n\n**She says: \"Do you like Pokemon?\"**\n\n**I say: \"Yes\"**\n\nWhen we're done, my rival asks me where I want to battle.  Somewhere that means something special to the two of us.  I pick the city where we officially started our journey and where I knew all our friends and teachers would be.  She agreed!  It was a beautiful and super fun battle.\n\n\\---\n\nThree days later my boyfriend gets to the same point in the game.  He has to take the same Elite Four interview that I did.  All the technical questions he aces (Gym leader names, types, etc).  Boyfriend isn't a Poke-Simp like I am, but he appreciates good mechanics and enjoys being able to play co-op with me.\n\n**She says: \"Why are you here?\"**\n\n**He says: \"For fun, I guess?\"**\n\n**He fails the interview.**  We gasp.  I can't believe the game actually has that as a fail condition.  Okay whatever try again.  Same as above, but now he picks the same answer I did to continue.\n\n**She says: \"Do you like Pokemon?\"**\n\n**He says: \"No\"**\n\nHe should be allowed to say that!  **But no, he failed again.**  He literally failed the interview.  A prodigy trainer that's \"just there for fun\" and \"doesn't actually like Pokemon\" beating the Elite Four and becoming champion in spite of that is a fun story!  It's interesting!  It's like the total opposite of who I am and what I would have picked and a love that!  Why can't GameFreak?  This entire game is about choice, about choosing your own path, finding your own treasure, but it forces you to answer a personality quiz a certain way?  WHAT?!  \n\nLet's continue.  Boyfriend pushes through the interview, saying what he's allowed to, and is permitted to battle.  The battles are fun, he wins, good job.  He gets to the part where his rival asks him where they should do their own battle together.  Somewhere special to them. Boyfriend asks me where I did mine, he picks a different option, a place that he feels is more special (the beach of their first battle).  \n\n**\"No, that's kind of boring\"**\n\nWhat?  You give me three options but one of them isn't an actual option?  Okay....  He picks the restaurant instead (the other one I didn't pick).  \n\n**\"No, I don't think \\[gym leader who works there\\] would appreciate the surprise visit.  Pick somewhere else!\"**\n\nAnd so, with no other choice, he picked the same option I did.  \n\nI don't really have any more to say about this, but it definitely ruined the experience for him and retroactively ruined my own experience because it made me realize my choices weren't relevant or my own.  I dunno.  Just feels completely contradictory to the vibe they were going for in this game.",

        "text": " \n\nModern games are not as good as everyone's saying they are for multiple reasons. Allow me to give some examples.\n\nGod Of War 2018 and God Of War: Ragnarok: These games are the epitome of a game being overyhyped. The story is not something brand new, innovative, and a masterclass in storytelling. Kratos has always been a father. He had a daughter in the original games, and they handled fatherhood way better in those than in the new ones. In GOW: Chains of Olympus we see how much he loves his family. It's a struggle for him to push his daughter away as he leaves her to save her, at the cost of never seeing her again. Kratos has always had depth, he's always had compassionate characteristics, but he also had anger, as the person who he was is greatly shaped by the world around him. The old GOW games didn't need to show you this in a 30, 15 minute long cutscenes. You got to see it in mostly gameplay, and maybe a few 2-3 minute long cutscenes. The combat is incredibly lacking, as taking away aerial combat, speed, jumps, and a combo counter greatly staggers the games combat. What used to feel like an enjoyable challenge that needed skill now feels almost completely braindead. They just made the combat a super simplistic system that anyone can just pick up and be amazing at without actually having to learn the deep mechanics of combat.\n\nElden Ring: Elden Ring is a good game, but it's propped up by FromSoft fanboys. They say,\"Everything in this game is a 10/10, and if you don't think this is the most innovative game ever I'll castrate you, flay you, and then crucify you in front of your family.\" You can't say any reasonable criticism without getting attacked by the pack of wild animals that is the FromSoft fanboy community. This game is not a masterpiece. It's combat is the exact same combat we've seen in almost all other souls games, the only difference is that now you can jump and attack at the same time. Overhyped. The story sucks. The story in Souls games aren't even cohesive stories. They're a collection of characters and events that all happen to take place in the same world. Overhyped. Giving your \"story\" through item descriptions is bullshit. If any other game did that, it would be criticized heavily by everyone, but not Elden Ring, it's got its loyal fanbase to protect it from everything.(And don't pretend that you perfectly understood the story of the Souls games without having to go to a lore channel, because quite honestly, you can't.) Overhyped. The characters are the same characters we've seen in games 1,000 times before. Obvious bad guys with weird motivations. Obvious good guys. Obvious grey characters in the middle. Characters that the story doesn't affect. And they have almost no depth to them.\n\nCall Of Duty: Call of Duty suffers from the same vein as Elden Ring, but unlike Elden Ring which has an unwavering fanbase that thinks their games are the second coming of Jesus Christ, Call of Duty fans keep handing over their money to Activision. They keep buying this shit, year after year. The last 8 years of COD games have been incredibly underwhelming with nothing of note coming out. But Activision doesn't have to put any effort into their COD games anymore, because regardless of how bad they are, people will keep buying. Even if it's worse than your stomach after eating Taco Bell in the morning, people will just fork their money over and keep the sludge that is COD games flowing.\n\nWhat happened to games? What happened to trying something new, creating something, trying to be different. Games now are all just copy and pasting everything that works in other games into their own games. All of sudden every game now is an open world rpg. Every game now has a free to play battle pass system. Every game now is a movie, because what happened to buying a game to play the game, am I right. I know, I'll just watch a movie with light gameplay elements. By the lord, most modern games just feel like they're trying to be films, but that's not the point of games. If I want to watch a movie, I'll go watch a movie, just let me play the fucking game.\n\nTL;DR: Modern games are overhyped. They blend into a sludge of poor creative design, and very loyal fanbases that keep this shit afloat.",

        "title": "I no longer care about “the illusion of choice” in games",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/zfbaau/i_no_longer_care_about_the_illusion_of_choice_in/",
        "text": "I often hear the same complaint about many games that include some sort of player choice, be it RPGs, Telltale-style adventures or whatever else. It goes something like: “I went and replayed the whole game, and it turns out there isn’t much difference between various choices”. And, yeah, I get where people are coming from. Replayabilty is a big concern to many, I used to care about that stuff myself. But I think that most games don’t include choices for the purpose of providing radically different experiences across multiple playthroughs, but exactly to provide just that – an illusion. That’s what a lot of art is, right? Illusions, smoke and mirrors, tricks and misdirection, all in service of making the beholder feel a certain way at a certain point. Games are comprised of a multitude of illusions stacked upon each other – the illusion of a living city, the illusion of intelligent characters and enemies, the illusion of a boundless world. And, yes, illusions of choice. If, in the moment you actually have to stop and think, maybe even briefly agonize over a decision – then, I’d say, the goal is achieved. So what if it partly falls apart once you stop replaying, poking and prodding? Most aspects of most games do.\n\nSure, some games go the extra mile. And the seams are often apparent. Look at the Virmire survivor in the Mass Effect trilogy. Yeah, they really put in a lot of effort, and yet, be it Kaidan or Ashley, the character is never as developed or interesting as any of the ones that are intended to stick with you throughout the whole trilogy games, like Garrus and Tali. And then there’re games like The Witcher 2, where your choices are incredibly meaningful, unlocking wholly different locations and quests, but that’s just it – in the end, it becomes not about whether or not you want to side with Roche or Iorveth, but rather which of the Act 2 locations you fancy visiting this time – Vergen or the Kaedweni camp. The choice is as real as it gets, but the illusion is shattered nevertheless. And you actually have to replay the game multiple times or risk missing out on, like, 30-40% of unique content. Which, in terms of the developer’s dedication, is utterly amazing. But I can see why most studios wouldn’t go for something like that, nor, frankly, would I want them to. If the game was enjoyable, it’ll probably be replayable regardless of how malleable its story is. Hell, I've replayed Mass Effect who knows how many times, and I usually stick to the same Paragon choices every time. Because the game makes me care enough to be unwilling to make choices that feel wrong just to see how things might play out for the sake of novelty.\n\nUltimately, these days I’m satisfied if a game manages to weave a compelling web of illusions even once. If on replay it turns out to have been a trick – I’m fine with that. Same reason I don’t look too closely at a magician’s sleeves.",

        "text": "With Embracer Group taking over the IP earlier this year, it would be nice to see them produce a full AAA experience of all of Middle Earth set in the events the trilogy. Hears why I think it's perfect, and why it should be based around Peter Jacksons movies. Many things would need to be worked out, such as respawning, how you interact with the fellowship, and how magic would work. \n\n1. The stats system in FromSoft games (strength, dexterity, vitality, etc) comes from DnD, and DnD was heavily inspired by Tolkien (as well as many other fantasy elements such as dragons, elves, dwarves). It is essentially the source material. \n2. The world is incredible. A large, complex landscape filled with different biomes and each more distinct from the last. Traversing from the Shire, to Rivendell, Moria, Helms Deep, Minas Tirith, and Mount Doom would be a jaw dropping spectacle. \n3. Countless enemies and bosses are at their disposal to throw at you. Every variant of orc, urak-hai, goblin, and man can be created to keep things fresh. The bosses are some of most iconic in a fantasy setting. The Nazgul on Weathertop, a giant cave troll in Moria, the Balrog, Lurtz, Saruman, Sharku, Grima, Gollum, Shelob, the King of the Dead, Mumakil, the Witch King, the Mouth, and Sauron himself (personally I would make him a physical being). Certain bosses would have to be locked until certain others are defeated to maintain some continuity obviously. \n4. The amount of customization that could be implemented is astounding. Starting with character creation, you could pick a race from man, elf, dwarf, hobbit, or wizard (maybe, depends how magic would work). With each of those having unique starting traits (lol the hitbox on a hobbit would be interesting). Moving on with picking a class, a ranger, thief, knight, squire, etc. All typical RPG classes could apply. Armour and weapons from not only each of the main races (man elf, dwarf), but their different kingdoms (eg. Gondor vs Rohan vs Dunedain). As well as gear from the evil forces, orcs, easterlings, etc. \n5. A few other miscellaneous things to cover. The lore is already established, all that just needs to be sprinkled into the game through item descriptions, dialogue, and world building. Characters from the fellowship and others could be summoned for boss fights (eg. Eowyn for the Witch King). DLC or a sequel is planned out for you in The Hobbit (either book version or movie version, I'm indifferent either way). \n6. Please let me know an idea for magic to work in this game. It's sort of \"soft magic\", and very unclear (to me) on who is able to wield it and by what means. My initial thoughts are that somehow you find a staff from a blue wizard (since there isn't much to know about them anyways) that lets you cast. \n\nAny of your thoughts would be appreciated.",
