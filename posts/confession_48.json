My dad told me while I was living with him to quit school, get a job, and pay rent. \n\nIn his defense, I was doing terrible. I was only focusing on my girlfriend. I wasn't passing many classes. This was the first time I had lived with my dad, ever in my life. So, he wasn't a disciplinary by any means. \n\nI went to live with him only because of issues fighting at school and being expelled. \n\nAfter he gave me the news, I went back to my mother so I could finish school. I just didn't want to be like them. \n\nI moved to my mom's house, and she said the same thing. Just drop out and get a job. I guess that was the best approach. So I dropped out.\n\nMy mom, step-dad, and myself soon started doing drugs. We will say it like that to keep it short. I'm not talking about easy stuff like weed. I'm talking crack, meth, coke, needles... whatever....\n\nI was 16 years old when I got my first rock. I was 16 or 17 when. I used my first needle. What a good life to live. Right? \n\nAt 18, I left my family. My sister asked me to come stay with her to get clean. Perfect! I later joined the Army and left home to never return. \n\nI do visit my parents, I speak to them, but I can never move back ever again. \n\nThey say once an addict always an addict. I'm currently 38 yrs old, and as bad as I would love to move back home, I can never. As a man, I realize it would never work. \n\nI live a comfortable life with my best friend, sole mate, and the love of my life. I don't think we would last a year being back home. I think problems would find me again. I could never compromise my relationship with my queen.",

We were alright pals, going to same parties, going to class together, manoeuvring in the same friend groups etc. He by no means is the sharpest tool in the shed, but he has a good heart. \n\nI started logging into his Messenger probably once a week just to have a look. I don't know why really, it was just really exciting getting a 1st hand glimpse into another persons life - not that he was living an extraordinary interesting life. Quickly once a week became twice, eventually everyday.\n\nI moved towns a little over a year later and he began to go down a pretty dark road, smoking weed on a daily and going on drug benders every weekend. This is where things got really funny and interesting. I would catch myself catching up with his adventurous drug fuelled shenanigans multiple times a day - simply just for having a laugh. \n\nThe year is now 2023, and this has gone on for the better of 6 years with no ending in sight. I simply just can't not check up on him and seeing how it's going. For a while he've been a reference point in me and my friends group chat, all knowing him and having a laugh over him, because he was so such a weird, special figure back then and in the years to come. They know I look at his messages, but we never talk about it and I never bring anything up.",

        "text": "When my boss started his company 10 years ago, he was working as a consultant to a big company and got paid hourly. After that he hired me. I also get paid hourly now. While I was with him in a training class he was delivering, he was discussing the types of contracts in project management, and one of them is time and material (i.e., hourly pay). He said that when he writes an email in one minute, he charges his clients 20 minutes because to be able to write an email in one minute that requires years and years of experience and that he must charge for that. He did that with all tasks. I was sitting at the back of the room when he said that. He looked at me and said \"oh, I should be very careful now because my employee is here in the room and he might do that too\" and everyone started laughing in an awkward way. Including him. It was very cringy. I came to learn that what he was doing is illegal (I believe it is called \"padding\"?). However, I now do the same thing to him (but never to anyone else). I charge whatever I feel is fair for me. For example, I specifically charge him for the time and money I spend training and buying online courses needed for the job. I basically translate the money I spend into hours and add those hours to my monthly invoice. I charge him for the my shower time when he forces me to come to the office (PS: my contract is 100% remote, but he threatened to fire me if I object to that).",

        "text": " Growing up, I always thought I was in the low-income bracket. My father was a single dad raising my sister and I, and I remember the struggles we went through after my parents' divorce when I was just five years old. This trauma is probably why my memory of those early years is so vivid.\n\nIn high school, I discovered what it was like to grow up with money. My friends had the latest phones and wore designer clothing like Abercrombie. To me, owning Abercrombie meant that someone came from a wealthy family. My dad eventually bought me my first Abercrombie jacket, but when I asked for more clothes, he would buy me Walmart clothes instead, which I perceived as lower-class.\n\nI felt like I needed to prove that we were in the middle class, so I started stealing from stores like Macy's and Abercrombie. I would resell the stolen cologne and eventually started stealing clothes. Over the course of a year, I made a few hundred dollars, but it left me feeling empty.\n\nMy father started to notice and confronted me about my new clothes. I apologized and got rid of everything I had stolen. It wasn't until the end of high school that I realized my father was actually part of the upper middle-class. He was a frugal man who prioritized providing for my sister and I and investing in our education, like SAT prep and Kumon. Now, as an adult, I take care of my father in his old age and understand that his frugality wasn't a reflection of our financial status, but his values.",
