We're looking at hopefully 100-500 cups in a day and we've checked some cafes that are handling that load well with two group machines. I'm a bit of a nerd and I do care about extraction consistency even if majority of the shots are going to be mixed with other flavors so the saturated group head of the Linea Classic interests me despite the higher price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main choices are a Linea Classic, an Aurelia II, and an Appia Life though recommendations from other brands within this price range is appreciated (San Remo, some other brand, etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen a video where volumetrics outperformed manually stopping a shot at the exact same time in terms of extraction consistency but I have not seen any comparison of volumetrics vs manually stopping the shot at matching yields. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will be picking up a Decent machine too down the line for pop-up events and as a back-up and experimentation machine if that makes a difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever machine I get, I will be upgrading the dispersion screens as well as the baskets (any other recommended upgrade mods as well?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy questions are mainly: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Would you still recommend volumetrics from a workflow perspective or should I save the extra money? \n2. Do I need the extra temperature stability of the Linea's saturated grouphead or is the Aurelia already excellent at this\n3. Do I even need to go above the 2 group Appia Life for the volume I listed?\n4. Do you have any other recommended machines I should read on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh and we'll be using a DF83 with SSP HU burrs but upgrading to a more robust commercial grinder down the line.",

I mostly alternate between an Oxo single cup pour over device and an Aeropress. \n\nI’ve also started to use a food scale and I typically use 10-15g dark or medium roast beans per cup. I often do 15g per cup for my first 2 cups of coffee, and then I’ll switch to a “half calf” method for my third and fourth cups where I do 5g caffeinated beans each. That places me at about 40-45g caffeinated beans daily.\n\nGoogling “caffeine per 10g coffee” brings up surprisingly complex and confusing info. Am I correct to assume that 10g medium or dark roast coffee beans might contain around 120mg caffeine, and only 60-80mg actually ends up being extracted during the brewing process?\n\nIf I play it safe by over-estimating, would it be fair to assume each 10g of brewed coffee contains about 100mg caffeine? So 45g brewed coffee is about 450mg caffeine?",

After some practice, I’ve mastered the pour-over technique sufficiently enough to produce more or less consistent cups.\n\nHowever, one issue that I have with my coffee and can’t seem to solve is this weird, dry sensation I experience in my lips after drinking the coffee. The sensation seems to start when I finish my coffee and continues to intensify even after the coffee is long gone in my stomach. After around half an hour or so my lips feel awfully dry and sticky, and the feeling doesn’t go away even if I drink plenty water. It takes around two hours and a lot of water for the sensation to fully disappear.\n\nAt first, I thought that I was overextracting my coffee, leading to astringency in my cup. But having tried plenty of oversteeped and astringent tea before, the sensation feels different from true astringency. The dry sensation doesn’t pop up but appears gradually and I feel it only in my lips while the rest of my mouth is fine. It also appears no matter how fine and coarse I grind my coffee or what recipe I use. And like I mentioned, the feeling doesn’t go away for quite some time after the coffee is finished.\n\nHave anyone experienced the same thing?

        "text": "Ok let me start by establishing street cred. Skip this first paragraph. I've been a barista off and on for like 5 years of my life, I fluxuate between some immersion, steep/release and pour over methods for my home brews, and I get good fresh beans with a grinder that costs easily 10-20x some of my brew methods. This is to illustrate that, while I know I have some to learn in the craft, I also am definitely not new around these parts. On to the issue.\n\nI hate the coffee that I enjoy  drinking at home. I have recently realized that my tastes in what I make at home is F A R from the pour overs I get at third wave shops. When I brew at home I like my resulting brew. End of story. However, when I go to the most prestigious shops in town for pour over, I get what I feel is a watery, mostly flavorless brew. When it cools, I do get a little more flavor out of it. This is becoming a recurring theme. Is this a common issue? I'd say this happens only at the extremely hobbyist snob shops serving Geshas and rarer beans, so I am inclined to believe this is a third wave taste preference thing. It is wildly frustrating to spend 10-15 euro on a cup of coffee prepared by people much more skilled than I am, only to barely taste anything. I'm not trying to get q rating tasting skills here, but is there a piece I'm missing? \n\nTL,DR: Third wave pourovers are flavorless. The more I spend, the less I taste. What's wrong with me?",

        "text": "I'm a fan and evangelist of Baratza products, especially for their repairability and double-especially for selling spare parts. I  bought my Encore in March 2017. It's worked great, grinds well for my AeroPress/Chemex/V60 house. I'm now stumped on a repair issue.\n\nHave replaced the cone burr once (May 2019, after heavy use at an office) and the ring holder once (June 2022), both using parts from Baratza.\n\nA  couple months ago, the Encore started refusing to start grinding, especially when beans are loaded in before starting. I've taken it apart a few times to check for jams, unclog grounds, etc. I've noticed  that:\n\n* It **will** grind if you start the grinder before adding the beans\n* It will often/usually **not grind** if you add beans before starting the grinder; or, sometimes, it will  refuse to start again, beans or no beans, after finishing a grind.\n* I can get it **grinding again** if I take off the hopper, reach in, nudge the central burr a little bit in either direction, put the hopper back on, then start it again. In other words, nudging the central cone a bit is how I \"reset\" the grinder to make it start working again. Obviously sub-optimal to keep dumping beans out when I discover it's \"unhappy.\"\n\nI've done most of the troubleshooting I've seen on Baratza's site, manuals, and videos: disassembled, checked all the wires heading to each components, especially the safety tab up by the grinder. The burr holder has all three tabs in place. I've cleaned every crevice I can get to. The only thing I can think of is that that little wing-nut screw on the top of the central burr seems to be a bit off, angled a bit more than slightly level. I've taken it off and put it back on (reverse thread!) a couple times, but it always seems just a bit off.  \nTo reiterate, when the Encore is working, it seems to be grinding fine. It just doesn't want to start sometimes, either because beans are loaded—or the beans might have nothing to do with it, it might just be intermittent and it feels like bean-loading is the issue.\n\nAppreciate any help you can offer! I'm quite willing to do whatever it takes to keep this good grinder going, be it a motor, circuit board, drive shaft, whatever.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI modded my delonghi Dedica long time ago and it's been working great until now.\n\nYesterday I wanted to check if nothing is leaking so I opened it again but this time I accidentally opened 2 wrong screws which were the screws holding the end of the 2 thin hoses going to the espresso head.\n\nIt popped out and there was a cone shaped spring with a plastic ball on top in the middle of it. There is also an O-ring there.\n\nSince it popped out, I didn't manage to see the orientation the spring was inside.\n\nI didn't take a picture of it but I will try to open it tomorrow again to take picture but maybe some of you know what I'm talking about until I do so.\n\nI'm not sure I inserted the spring back in the right direction (although it seem the most logical way it goes inside), or if something else is causing the issue because now the machine has a problem:\n\nWhen I put the portafilter and press the espresso button, the handle starts unscrewing itself as if there's too much pressure that pushes it out.\n\nOr, the problem is because I didn't screw something else tight enough and it's not holding the portafilter strong enough? \n\nWhen I left it unattended, the portafilter blew away with force (and broke the glass)\n\nMaybe I didn't put the screws in the correct place? (Some screws are longer and some are shorter)\n\nIs there any manual for that? Last time I did it I took pictures of the screws location but this time I didn't and I don't have it anymore\n\nThanks",

Up until now, I have used the Eureka Mignon Specialita with light roasted coffee beans and the Fellow Ode (v1.1, original burrs). However, a few days ago, I placed an order for the Niche Zero and SSP MP burrs for the Fellow Ode. Now, I'm afraid I won't like the taste of conical burs, or that I won't notice the difference in the first place.\n\nI usually make around 20% espresso, 30% americano, 30% cappuccino/latte, and 20% V60. Right now, I'm considering selling the Eureka and Fellow grinders, cancelling the Niche and SSP burr orders, and just getting the P64 instead. I'd like to hear your thoughts, and maybe someone has already been in the same situation as me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Is it better to have a single grinder or two that complement each other?\n* Would it be better to have the Niche for roasts that are more medium, and occasionally light, and mostly use the V60 with the Fellow Ode for light roasts?\n* Once you dial in the P64 for V60 and espresso, are there any downsides to switching between brewing methods?\n* Is there anything else noteworthy to consider?",

Somehow I’m still getting mostly sludge and grounds in my coffee. And the drinkable coffee is going to the bottom chamber? What gives?",

Part of the reason I am drinking coffee is to give myself a break from feeling tired 24/7 so I still want to feel the effects of caffeine. Do you guys have any recommendations on types of coffee I should try that don’t taste too caffeinated but still have that effect or is iced lattes the way to go?",

Then i slowly got into Hario V60 as well as the vietnamese Phin Filter using vietnam beans. (which is my fav so far). I also got a Moka pot which I only tried once.\n\nFor the past year, I have been trying different recipes, brewing factors and etc and more or less got a rough knowledge. Now, I have gotten a little bored with my current set-up, so what is next for me? Be it trying out new brewing methods or trying any espresso based drink using moka pot, or any drink I can make using black coffee?\n\nI do not wish to invest in a home espresso machine as It is expensive and takes up space.",
