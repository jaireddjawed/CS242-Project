I'd say their isolationism may be more related to ethnicity and tradition than religion, since Christianity is very universalist.",

Everything else is an illusion.   \n\nThis is not an argument for human atheism. Humans are limited in their knowledge and power. We are not omniscient or omnipotent. We are not the cause or effect of everything. We are not real in the same way that Allah is real.   \n\nBut it is an argument that atheism is the only rational position for Allah to take.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/yr2618/so_what_makes_a_religion_a_cult/",
        "text": "I think this is a fair question worth discussing. What makes certain religions be considered cults and where should the line be drawn. I think it is quite disingenuous to take the US government approach and see pretty much anything as a religion as long as beliefs are sincerely held. On the other hand, the idea that \"religions are just cults that have been around\" position taken by many New Atheists is extreme at the other direction. In short, I think all reasonable observers can agree that the FLDS is a cult while the Anglicanism isn't. \n\nSo where do people draw the line. Many people for example argue that the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS, aka Mormons) are cults. When asked why, they usually say:\n\n - **Strict rules**: Both of these faiths are quite clearly high-demand religions. To start there is the standard stuff of no sex outside marriage, no gay marriage, etc. Mormons have strict rules against alcohol, tea, and coffee. They also require young men to serve 2 year missions away from home under strict conditions. Men and Women are required to wear temple garments as a form of underwear at all times which also serve as a form of modest dress code since they cannot be exposed (i.e. shoulders to knees must be covered; exception for sports and swimming). They have to fast the first Sunday of every month.\nOk, what about JW. While they do not have dietary consumption or fasting ules, they are required to spend 20 hours a week tracting for their faith. Men are also expected to serve two years at HQ. They have a modestly and formality dress code. They cannot celebrate anything - including birthdays and Christmas - and most infamously cannot accept a blood transfusion. Oh and you are strongly discouraged from getting a higher education. And of course, the standard stuff of no sex outside marriage, no gay marriage, etc.\n\n -**You cannot leave**: Quite self-explanatory - you cannot leave. Well I mean you can, no one with a gun is going to run you down. And it is not like Scientology where they will work overtime to destroy you. But your family will not accept it. JW have it as an official policy to Shun - i.e. never speak with you ever again. LDS has nothing official but culturally the same thing. People do not accept your decision to leave the faith.\n\n\nNow both those sound quite culty. But hold on, what about Islam? Muslims, whether Shia or Sunni - at least within the mainstream - have strict rules. To start there is the standard stuff of no sex outside marriage, no gay marriage, etc. You cannot drink alcohol or eat Pork. Meat must be slaughtered in a specific manner and with a specific prayer to be acceptable for consumption. You have to recite 5 mandatory ritual prayers a day and fast for 30 days in a row - including no water - once a year. Women have to cover up from head to toe, except face and hands, in a hijab and opposite gender interactions are strictly regulated. Mosques are segregated and Men and Women are not allowed to be friends according to many - professional interactions only. No handshaking either. And in many Muslim communities you can't really date. Marriages are either fully or semi-arranged. While it may not be forced, you don't really get to know the other person and are not really dating in the conventional sense. In short, Islam is a high demand religion.\n\nWhat about point two? While unlike JW or LDS, depending on where you live, you will be run down by a gun if you leave. And while that is not a concern for 99% of Muslims in the west, they face the same process as ExMormons or exJW - your family will not accept it and it would be hell. \n\nBut does anyone consider Islam to be a cult? No. On the contrary it is considered to be a mainstream respectable faith. What about Orthodox Judaism? Its rules and gender interactions are very similar to Islam and leaving it also likewise a problem. No one calls that a cult either. \n\nSo, it is clear that our view of what is a cult is biased towards mainstream / established religions. People only call something a cult if it:\n\n - Is a High Demand Religion\n - You cannot leave\n AND\n - It is a New Religious Movement\n\n\nNow I do not see how a religion being new makes it more culty than an established religion. On the other hand, I consider the first two factors to be determinative. However, I would replace the third with \"those at the top are exploiting the members for personal gain\".  I think those three factors need to be examined and based on how strongly the faith scores on these, it can or not be considered a cult or at least culty",

        "text": "I was recently asked, \"When people say they are \"spiritual,\" what do they mean?\"\n\nI thought it was a brilliant question — one that spiritual seekers themselves often don't stop to ask.\n\nWhile there are countless practices, beliefs, traditions that fit comfortably under the heading \"spirituality,\" I think there's a simple answer to this question that unites them.\n\nIn short, to be spiritual is to seek connection with the spirit of the world.\n\nOK. That's well and good. But what is the \"spirit of the world?\"\n\nTo answer that, it's useful to distinguish between \"spirit\" and \"soul\" — two words that are often used interchangeably.\n\nWriters like John Welwood and Bill Plotkin define \"soul\" as the essence of an individual entity. On the other hand, \"spirit\" is the essence of the universe.\n\nThe spiritual landscape can be roughly divided into traditions that focus more on spirit or on soul.\n\nPlotkin characterizes spirit as the upward path while soul is the downward path (though not in a negative way). Spirit is universal, transcendent, and is characterized by the upper world: the realm of light. Soul is personal, immanent, and is characterized by the descent inward to the essence of who we are: the intimate darkness.\n\nWhile all religious traditions acknowledge both spirit and soul in some way, Plotkin argues that the dominant world religion focus on the upward path of spirit. This includes Buddhism, Abbrahamic traditions, Hinduism, Taoism, where the goal is to know, unite, or align with the universal essence.\n\nBy and large the earth-based, indigenous, animistic, magical, traditions emphasize the path of soul, where the goal is to descend into the earthy, watery depths to find there your true self. \n\nThe traditions that focus on soul—those that are earthy, natural, or \"dark\"—have been considered \"less than\" the spirit based traditions or literally demonized.\n\nHowever, the movement upward and downward are really both a movement toward a central truth.\n\nWhether our spiritual practice seeks to touch the universal spirit (the essence of reality) or our personal soul (the essence of ourselves) we are reaching for, and connecting with, the same thing.\n\nIn Hinduism, atman is considered both the universal soul and the soul contained in every individual.  \n\n\nIn Kabbalistic Judaism, each person carries a \"spark\" of the divine.\n\nIn Christianiy, the Kingdom of Heaven is said to be within.\n\nThe last thing to mention about spirituality that distinguishes it from philosophy (as it is generally understood today) is that spirituality doesn't seek to understand, it seeks to experience.\n\nIn the practice of philosophy, the tendency is to try to understand the world with reason, keeping it at a distance in order to maintain intellectual clarity and control.\n\nIn the practice of spirituality, the aim is to let the world wash over and through us, to achieve an intimate, felt experience of connection - or union - with reality.\n\nTo be spiritual is to seek connection with the spirit of the world, and thus enter fully into the heart of life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal article &amp; video: \n\n[https://www.daniellevshkolnik.com/post/what-does-it-mean-to-be-spiritual](https://www.daniellevshkolnik.com/post/what-does-it-mean-to-be-spiritual)",

        "text": "It seems there is clearly a division between people who are religious by tradition and those who are religious by spiritual experience. This division seems fundamental even at the start of religions... Judaism always divided when a new prophet came, between believers and non-believers of the revelations. Christianity also seems to highlight the division between spiritual Judaism and the then-rising legalistic Judaism, and Jesus condemned the later while praised spiritual interpretation of the law in Judaism (Hillel school?).\n\nOf course, many traditionally religious people become spiritually religious, but often they point out to \"finding\" something or a \"revelation\" or a miracle. This is especially true in USA, where we have Christians and Born-Again Christians. However, I found that it seems Hinduism and Judaism also have some mystic paths that some of their believers follow.\n\nThere seem to be a dynamic equilibrium between spiritual and traditional religious people. Often, spiritual religious people have children to become traditionally religious people who later became non-believers, stay traditional or become spiritual in their own right. \n\nSome denominations seem to focus more on those \"born again\" believers than others. It also seems that spiritual religious people have no problem believing in miracles and have no problem claiming they see them often, and even tell stories about God making miracles for them (often as synchronicities, or unexpected healing of chronic illness). Meanwhile, traditionally religious people seem to be more realistic and often believe miracles do not happen anymore, or if they happen, they are very rare.\n\nThe downside of the spiritual religious is that they can be very rigid, while it may be satisfying for most practitioners of it. Meanwhile traditionally religious people may rely too much on institutionalization and see religion more as a set of rules.\n\nI find this odd because often these groups act and prioritize so many different things, and yet they both are labeled as \"religious\". Sometimes they practice opposite values and attitudes, and even different beliefs in the same religious community.",

I can relate to a god embodying the rage to overcome all foes, the Darwinistic brutality of warfare, the shrewd knowledge of myriad things mundane and arcane, the joyous submission to one's inevitable fate and living one's life boldly and recklessly, the constant murder-orgies in Valhall until the glorious final stand at Ragnarok. I can't relate to the hyperabstract embodiment of cosmic energies, even though She is more philosophically fulfilling, whereas Odin is more spiritually fulfilling.\n\nAnd before you propose to worship them both, that won't be possible, because I am a pantheistic monist.

        "text": "I read the Gospels for the first time as a Jewish adult and a few things jumped out at me. It's not the theology that caught my attention, but rather the character of Jesus. A few notes:\n\n-Following the teachings of Christ turns one into a lion. In a general contrast to the Tanakh, the focus with Jesus is on the soul/afterlife, not prolonging life or building legacy. It is the final destination of the soul that counts.\n\n“Don't be afraid of those who want to kill your body; they cannot touch your soul. Fear only God, who can destroy both soul and body in hell.\"\n\nWhether he is correct or not, this mindset leads to a very different life approach than the one we find in traditional wisdom literature which often focuses on living a long life or building legacy. If one is truly able to live this then one is fearsome... at least while alive.\n\n-Jesus seemingly teaches how to pick up women/become attractive even though he was supposedly celibate (in toledot yeshu he was a womanizer but I wouldn't think less of him either way.) In any case women played a huge role in spreading Christianity and its understandable why. I know of no other figure in the Tanakh who nails this subject so hard. \"Whoever is the greatest should be the servant of the others.\" I.e. show others that you are in a position to help; don't just command them. There is so much to say about this topic but Jesus somehow brilliantly mixes love, spirituality, a focus on the soul, and terror in a way that makes him jump off the page. He is either the world's greatest demagogue or an absolutely brilliant figure; in either case he is worthy of attention.",

For example, he claimed that it's not uncommon for theists to both believe that God created the world in 6 days approximately 6000 years ago, but at the same time also believe that Big Bang is true and that event happened 13.8 billion years ago. Do any of you believe this or know someone who does?\n\nAnother example is believing in both evolution and that the Earth is around 4.5 billion years old, while at the same time believing in Adam and Eve being created as the first humans about 6000 years ago. Do any of you believe both statements to be true at the same time, or do you know someone who does?\n\nDo you think these scientific theories can go hand in hand with our creation stories? Can both be true at the same time? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.",

        "text": "I’d like to preface this post by saying that I’m agnostic but i, in no way have any problems with religious people. I simply cannot wrap my head around it. \n\nI understand the pull towards religion; the moral teachings, spirituality, generally good rules to live your life by, ect. What I don’t understand is how people can truly believe that the religion they follow is the right one. The way I see it, the religion you follow is mainly determined by two things; the time and place of your birth. If your born in America in the present day, you will most likely be extremely exposed to Christianity, and therefore believe in it. But if you were born in Ancient Greece you would believe in the gods of Olympus…\n\nIt seems entirely dependent on chance and indoctrination. Add on the fact that there are thousands of different religions, and you just so happen to be born into the correct one? seems extremely illogical to me. \n\nSo why do people continue to believe? I’m not saying anyone is wrong, just how are you sure that you’re right? \n\nI’ve asked this same question to religious friends and family, but have only gotten the same illogical response: “My religion says it’s the right religion, therefore all others are fake”. How can you say that without seeing the absurdity of that statement? \n\nIm truly not hating on anyone’s way of life. I’m simply trying to understand it in a logical fashion. So please tell me, why do you believe? \n\nPs. I personally believe that humans cannot comprehend the truth of the universe, so why try with religion? I’m much happier saying “I don’t know” than believing thousand year old stories that claim to be the truth.",
