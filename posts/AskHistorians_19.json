        "text": "I mean using infantry to support cavalry at the wings. This tactic seems to be pretty effective at beating even superior cavalry forces. The biggest example that comes to my mind is the Battle of Gaugamela, where Alexander used his light troops and foot companions to contend with the heavily armoured and more numerous Persian cavalry opposing his flank.\n\nBattle of Pharsalus is another example, where Caesar baited the more numerous Pompeian cavalry to his hidden spearmen and those forces together routed the Pompeians. \n\nDe Re Militari has a line about this as well: \n\n\"If your cavalry is not equal to the enemy's it is proper, after the ancient custom, to intermingle it with light infantry armed with small shields and trained to this kind of service. By observing this method, even though the flower of the enemy's cavalry should attack you, they will never be able to cope with this mixed disposition.\"\n\nSo I'm curious why this wasn't a common tactic, seeing that it's pretty effective at countering superior cavalry forces, provided they can be baited. The usual tactic seems to be cavalry at the wings, and letting them charge the enemy cavalry while infantry fought each other, and whichever cavalry wins can encircle the infantry. In medieval battles such dispositions are even rarer, where it seems to have infantry blocks acting static while knights charged each other again and again, retreating to the infantry to regroup.\n\nThough past the age of swords and spears, I think Napoleon also had a quote about the power of infantry and cavalry attacking together, but I can't remember it exactly...",

Among other things, I find it very hard to visualize how people settle \"over\" the ruins of old settlements in a way that preserves \"layered\" evidence of the old settlement. \n\nIs it really as simple as people building new homes on the ruins of old ones, and archaeologists scrutinizing the accumulated layers of ruins? If so, it seems like that technique only works for sites and cultures that rebuild in that specific way -- without completely fully clearing debris. Is that right, or is there something more fundamental about construction and city planning that almost always preserves evidence of the prior layer? \n\nPardon the example, but the World Trade Center comes to mind as I lived in lower Manhattan while the old site was being cleared and rebuilt into 1 World Trade Center. Would a future archaeologist digging in \"the settlement mound of Manhattan\" see a \"layer\" for the pre- and post-9/11 buildings at that site, or do modern construction techniques obliterate prior construction so thoroughly that the pre-9/11 site would be invisible to a future digger? Is that a problem in other premodern sites too? \n\nThank you. If there are any graphics for helping people visualize settlement mound \"layers,\" I would appreciate it greatly!",

Why did that even exist in the first place and what was viewed as beneficial about Nazism? I can’t think of anything redeemable about their ideology other than the benefit of having power centrally located making it easier to make government changes since you don’t need to hold elections, etc. to get things done, which is something countries like China and Singapore have used as a beneficial thing, but other than that it’s literally just a dictatorship/monarchy with nationalist/patriotic elements.",
