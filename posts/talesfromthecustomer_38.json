Went to a local chain in Minnesota. \n\nUsed the self-check out, was entering in codes no problem until I got to the cantaloupe. There was a sticker, so I looked at it for a few seconds and was surprised to not see a 4 digit code, looked again, saw \"MAPS\" made in Guatemala, but not the 4 digit code to enter. So I went to the \"look up item\" section in the self-check out.  Soon after I entered the girl at the end of the self-check out says \"the code is 4050\" I look over and thank her, go back and enter it, she then says \"it says that on the sticker right in front of you\" \n\nI said, \"Oh, I didn't see it\" and because I am curious, I looked down again. No where on that sticker was 4050. \"Huh, I still don't see it on here, I don't think it is on here\". \n\nShe then rolled her eyes then said\" yes it is, it's on there\" sighed, rolled her eyes again then walked away From her desk. \n\n-_-  ok, I know I can sometimes miss things right in front of me and I know ppl do it all the time, but that was kinda rude. \n\nI finished checking out. Got home and looked again, still didn't see it. Had my boyfriend and brother in law look at it, in case I am blind or unintentionally missing the number right there.  That code is not there. Even if it had been, that was not the way to handle that situation. I know we all have bad days, and I am just putting that as a bad morning, maybe having to work on a holiday she maybe celebrates, but it just kinda rubbed me the wrong way this morning. \n\nTL;DR Don't assume you are right.

        "text": "Sorry for a second post in less than an hour.\n\nThis happened quite recently, about a month ago. \n\n**Context:** In my city, food trucks are NOT a thing. It is just too hot, and there are no places for them to park and sell the food. We don't even have street vendors, but probably for other reasons. Around a month ago, we had a small food truck festival, with big name trucks from Britain being shipped here and the cooks being flown out, plus some local ones.\n\n**Story:** Now, one of the \"local\" food trucks was actually set up with a tent next to it selling those high end snacks, and spices, and candies, and things, and providing small free samples of those snacks. One of those available snacks was Kale chips. I'd never had kale and was curious and hesitant to try it out and this was the conversation that followed. I will be Me, Sales Lady will be SL and Salesman will be SM:\n\n&gt; Me: Oh are these Kale chips? I've only heard bad things *wink and laugh*\n\n&gt; SL: *laughs* I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised, sir!\n\n&gt; SM: *in the most honest to god cheerful voice you'll ever hear* No you won't! They're terrible! *everyone laughs*\n\n&gt; Me: *eat one and visibly gag at the taste. It was so so salty* \n\n&gt; SM: Told you! \n\n&gt; Me: *still trying to recover from the horribleness and cracking up with laughter* I like you, mate. (Note: He was British) Can you recommend some good all-spices for meat?\n\nI didn't end up buying anything, but man, that guy would be able to sell glasses to a blind man if he tried. I just wanted to say that customers can always see through your spiel, and while some of us won't hold it against you (I'm talking about the sh*t-tier people from TFR, who are on the other end) a lot of us appreciate a bit of honesty, especially if it's hilarious. So use your corporate mandated speech, and if you have the energy, tell them what you honestly prefer. It helps. Believe me. Do it and see your numbers go up.\n",

        "text": "Hey everyone, first time poster, first time lurker. \n\nAbout 7-ish years ago, I was vacationing with my family in Holland, and it was quite a memorable experience, because of the beauty of the sights, and many other things. We were staying with a family friend in a tiny apartment in Nijmeigen (sorry for the spelling) so we had to take a train up to Amsterdam. I was about 12 at the time, so we didn't do any of the stuff Amsterdam is famous for, but at my insistence we went to The Van Gogh Museum, and I was in awe! They were missing my favourite painting of his, even in poster form. So we went outside, I was slightly dejected until I saw a tent set up outside selling prints of Starry Night! It was the same size as the small posters from the museum and a LOT cheaper. I picked it out, and my dad went to pay for it. The price was 1 euro more than we had in change. While my dad was scrounging around for change, asking the vendor if he could break a 50, a Dutchman popped a 1 euro coin down onto the table and gave me a huge ear to ear grin and winked at my dad, and told him not to worry about it. We tried to pay him back, but he was gone, like Batman into the night. He would forever be The Flying Dutchman.\n\nFast forward to 5 years ago, and many times since.\n\nI was now watching a very similar situation unfold but in my hometown (big city, actually) where a little girl didn't have the right amount of change to buy an ice cold drink on a sweltering day (think about 120+ F,) and not even thinking about it, I opened my wallet and dropped the few coins that were need to complete the transaction and winked at the cashier. Later I thought back to The Flying Dutchman and how much his coin meant to me, and how little it must have meant to him, compared to the feeling of helping someone with a little bit, because now that I had been in the same situation, I understood. \n\nIt feels good to give, even when it's an incredibly small amount. It helps those who are just struggling to find change or don't have any to begin with. I implore you to carry around change, you never know whose life you can help. \n\nTL;DR: The Flying Dutchman helped pay for my poster of a painting, I paid it forward for many years and still do, to this day.",

He was alone, without a shopping cart (unusual), but what was strange was he kept walking very quickly up and down the aisles.  When he passed by my wife the third time, she was standing four feet from her cart across the aisle. As he passed between her and her cart, she saw him place something into her cart.  At first, she assumed he mistook her for his wife, but at that moment, they were alone in that aisle.  He continue d to walk very quickly to the end of the aisle and disappear. She looked at the item he'd placed in her cart: pickled beets.  She was puzzled, and put them aside. A minute later, the guy walked by her again. She said nothing, but made full eye contact, which the 40-yr-old guy avoided.  After that, he didn't come by again.\n\nI think the guy was \"shopping cart bombing\": putting unwanted stuff into strangers' carts that they then pay for and don't discover until they get home.  He picked the busy day, Saturday before Easter, and who likes \"pickled beets\"?  The guy wasn't committing a real crime, just being a nuisance. We've shopped there 15 years and never had this happen before.  What do you think?",

        "text": "So last year my dad got a new phone contract. They sent him a SIM card that worked for a week, stopped working and so he phoned up customer services and they sent him out a new one. Job done right? Nope. \n\nThe new SIM didn't work either, so my dad called them up again, but this time nobody would answer within 40 minutes and if he did get in touch he'd be told the new SIM should work and they wouldn't do much else for him. He started to use a pay as you go in the same phone and it worked just fine. He tried to call up to cancel but couldn't get through to anyone.\n\nHe kept trying over the weeks to cancel this SIM but nobody would help him out, saying \"Oh we'll just send you a new one.\" or \"Try putting it in a different phone.\" even though the pay as you go worked fine. Eventually he just decided if he stopped paying the bill somebody would actually talk to him about the issue rather than ignoring him. \n\nSo they sent a debt collection agency after him, after explaining that he had never received the service he was paying for the debt collection agency sided with him and tried to dispute it. This was about 6 months ago now, so this has been going on for half a year.\n\nHe asks me to try deal with it, since he's too old and too tired to deal with it anymore (and he's kind of a pushover, no offence dad). I go in store then get told to call their customer service using their phones, and decline as we were in a rush. The next time I walked by the store I thought \"Ok, I'll just ask if I can call up since I have a few hours to spend.\"\n\nStaff tells me I'm not allowed to use their phones and they only connect to security. Oh ok.\n\nI phone up myself, and since this account has been closed for over 8 months in total since this all started we have to go a long way through getting the details with his address etc. They tell me they'll raise a dispute because they think it's unfair their own company is trying to charge my dad an early cancellation fee for a service he didn't get.\n\nNext week we get a letter from a new debt collection agency. A bit pissed off, I call them and explain the situation. Again, they side with us and say they'll raise a dispute and it'll take 7 working days. I call up 10 working days later and they tell me I didn't provide them enough details for the dispute so it didn't get sent out. \"Well okay why didn't you get in touch about that?\" They didn't reply to that and told me my dad will probably have to pay anyway.\n\nNow I'm currently waiting for the response on the dispute before I have to sit on line for customer service for another hour.",

        "text": "This was more weird than anything, and it really has more to do with another person than the employees, but here goes anyway... (Also, I'm sorry if this is long-winded but I've been writing novels for so long that long-winded is really the only way I know how to write anecdotes.)\n\nSo yesterday was Good Friday, and as such our department store was closed, meaning no work! Yay! Usually it's a pain in the butt trying to arrange meetups around shifts, so two of my workmates and I decided to celebrate by going out to lunch at a nice little bar/restaurant. It has beautiful views of the harbour and so, even though it was overcast and looked like rain, we decided to take our drinks to a little table outside. All was going well while we waited for our food to arrive; we chatted and laughed about work, the usual. That was when I noticed some flashing lights over the shoulder of my male coworker, who shall be named... uh... Flipper. Because. \n\nMy female coworker, Nana (she's only about twenty so she's not a grandmother, but she looks after her family's little'uns enough for her to be their effective nana) saw them too and we watched interestedly as a traffic cop got off his flashing police motorbike and started writing a ticket for this beat-up old car parked outside the restaurant. Behind us, a live band was setting up on this little raised dais, when one of the band members -- mid-thirties, maybe, kind of scruffy-looking -- just dropped his guitar and strode up to the car and the cop. It was enough of a distance away that Nana and I couldn't hear what they were saying (Flipper was facing the other way and didn't want to rubber-neck too much by turning to watch) but the man kept gesticulating wildly to the car and looked pissed off, which only incited the policeman to start inspecting the car more thoroughly. His ticket book was being filled in like nobody's business. This made the man even madder and he stormed back over to the dais shouting insults and swears back at the cop. We were fully prepared for an arrest at this point, but to our surprise the cop just finished writing the ticket, stuck it to the guy's car and rode off. \n\nAll's well that end's well, right? Nope. \n\nIt couldn't have been more than five minutes after that when, in the middle of a pleasant conversation about some of the more infuriating customers we'd had at work, a shadow fell across our table. We all looked up to see the same man staring down at us, his face utterly blank. \n\nMAN: Okay, so, we think it's going to rain so we're going to have to use this table to set up over here. *hesitates* If you don't mind.\n\nWe were not prepared in the slightest for this request. All the other tables outside were full besides one, which an older couple were currently heading towards, and we weren't even certain there were other tables inside that were free.\n\nUS: .... Uh .... Well, we .... Um ....\n\nAnd then, without waiting for a response that included actual words, he started scooping all the condiments and napkins and things off our table and dropped them on the table were the new couple were currently getting settled in. Then, before we could do much more than reach for our bags, he picked up our drinks and handed them to us before dragging the table further under the cover of the building. We were left standing hopelessly outside the restaurant, drinks in hand. \n\nThankfully, a lovely waitress with what sounded like a German accent came past then and noticed us standing there like idiots. She shall be Lovely German Waitress.\n\nLGW: Oh, are you okay here?\n\nN: *laughing, because she's cool like that* Not really, we just got evicted from our table. \n\nLGW: What? *looks around and sees what happened. Frowns but stays professional* I see. Well, come inside with me and we will find you somewhere to sit. \n\nAnd she did. We ended up with seats at a raised bar table, and all the waitresses were much cleverer than me when I waitressed because they seemed to know exactly where to find us now with our food. We ended up staying for some two hours eating and drinking and enjoying ourselves, but we did decide that, no matter how good the band's music was (it was okay, for the record, not really my thing but they weren't out of tune or anything) if anybody within said band can just evict one of their prospective audience members, pretty much leaving them high-and-dry with nowhere to sit for all he knew, we're probably not going to like them by default.\n\nTL;DR: Coworkers and I enjoy a nice drink and lunch on our rare day off together; get evicted from our table by a pissed off band-member leaving us with nowhere to sit.\n\n",

That being said, I always treat retail workers with respect because I know how it feels to be treated badly by customers.\n\nYesterday I took a trip to the mountains with some friends, and in the town below where we were going to, we decided to stop at a little convenience store to get some snacks and drinks for the rest of the drive. When I finished picking out what I wanted, I went up to the counter to pay.\n\nThe clerk completely ignored me, and he was standing right there facing me. He acted like I wasn't even there and I kind of cleared my throat, and said, \"I'm kind of ready to check out, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, uh okay.\" He said.\n\nSo he starts checking everything out and the total came to like $9, and he asks if it's debit or credit I'm paying with and I tell him it's debit. He tells me to slide my card and I do, and for some reason it declines. Okay, that's weird, but it happens, so I try it again. It declines again, and I usually don't like to be *that* guy, but I asked if I could try it one more time because I was concerned as to why it wasn't taking.\n\nFinally, I realized I was entering the pin for my other card and put the right one in for this card. It went through, and the receipt printed out and the clerk goes, \"It's declined.\"\n\nI looked at him, then the receipt and then back at him... Thoroughly confused. \n\n\"But... It said it accepted it and the receipt printed out...\" I said, trying to be nice but I was losing patience.\n\n\"Well... Oh I guess it did, yeah.\" Like he looked down at the screen and then looked at the receipt and said that. I was so confused.\n\nSo he gives me the receipt and my bag, and I walk outside, where everyone was waiting for me, and I was still super confused. They all looked at me weird, because apparently the guy came out after me and watched me walk across the parking lot, but when I got into my car, facing him, he walked back inside super quick. I think he thought it was fraud or something... But what the fuck? There are better ways to go about that.",

She also went down to the police station and filed a report. Things aren't done with either of those things yet, but it's a start. I'll make a new update post when I have more news.**\n\nThis is actually about my mom.\n\nShe went to a grocery store yesterday, a regional chain, and had a bad experience. No one was there to ring her up, and no one was watching the self-checkout. There was a group of employees talking to each other well away from the registers, but that's it.\n\nAt the bottom of the self-checkout receipt was the classic \"fill out this customer survey!\" thing, so she went home and filled it out online.\n\nThen, she got a call today. It was a man calling himself a manager of that store, \"returning her call.\" \n\nRight away, he had attitude. He said \"so, you had bad customer service?\" She said, \"not exactly.\" She was about to say there was no customer service at all, but he cut her off and said, \"so you're a liar then.\"\n\nShe attempted to explain the problem. He hurled insults, so she  said \"have a nice day\" and hung up on him.\n\nHe called right back and he said something like, \"Don't you fucking hang up on me.\" She tried to just say goodbye, and he was like, \"I bet you'll go to the other locations and tattle on them, as well!\"\n\nFinally she hung up and he didn't call back.\n\nMy mom is understandably distraught. She's trying to let it go, though. I suggested she call corporate, but she doesn't think it will help. Plus, the guy had her phone number, and could find her address and retaliate if he gets fired.\n\nWhile talking like that is absolutely terrible, the real problem to me is the fact that he was able to get her information from her survey to call and harass her. That should be *ILLEGAL.*\n\nI feel like I should do something. Maybe contact the company anonymously and tell them that it shouldn't be okay that they're handing out the personal information from complaints to store managers, but I don't want to make my mom feel unsafe.\n\nThen again, this shouldn't be going on any longer.\n\nWhat do y'all think?",

My biggest pet peeve is the hotel insisting on cleaning my room.\n\nIts pretty common to use the do not disturb sign on the door, and that works usually for a night or 2.  But usually by the 3rd night they clean the room anyways.\n\n\nMost recently I had a 3 night stay.  I should have expected an issue since I had to go ask for a Do not disturb sign.\n\nOn the 3rd day I took my luggage with me because I might of got stuck working late.  I didn't check out.  I left the DND sign on the door.   My reservation included that night and I was already charged for it.\n\nI returned to the room later that day.  The sign was gone, the room was cleaned, and all my stuff was missing from the refrigerator.  I inquired with the front desk and they called the housekeeper who said they \"thought I was gone\"\n\nThe hotel had no reasonable explanation.  Why is this so common??   They took my beer, coconut water, and some bottled water.   None of which are particularly cheap items.    I told the hotel I considered this theft and expected a discount which they eventually provided.  I still find this completely unacceptable.  ",

        "text": "So this is not so much a tale, more of a question hoping somebody knows the answer.\n\nI've noticed that almost everywhere I go, if I pay in cash there's a very specific pattern to how I receive my change.  The cashier counts out the bills, stacks them into a pile in their hand, tears out the receipt, puts it on top of that stack, then counts out the change and puts it on top of the receipt.\n\nMy question is: is this a trained behavior?  Are their cashier courses somewhere that teach this?  And if so, why?\n\nIt seems really inefficient.  First of all, it's ignoring a whole processor in the workflow: me.  While they are counting out that change, I could already be putting those bills in my wallet.  Not optimizing the workflow by using two processors instead of one makes the transaction take much longer than necessary.\n\nSecondly, the total amount of work done is increased.  A stack of cash-&gt;receipt-&gt;change is not useful to me, I have to unravel it to put bills in my wallet, change in my pocket, and receipt in the trash (most of the time).\n\nIt seems to me the best workflow would be: count out the bills, put them on the counter, count out the coins, put them on the counter, tear off the receipt, put it on the side with a pile of receipts.  Then while they are counting the change, I can be simultaneously walleting the bills, and when the change goes down I can just pocket it.  Finally the receipt I can take on my way out while they start on the next customer, or leave if I don't want it.",

When I signed up for the new ISP I got a package deal for 150 MbPS down and a phone line for $80, and then the next day went to pick up my router/modem combo. My new apartment was already wired for the ISP I was switching to (part of the reason for the switch, the other being 10X the speed at the same cost) and I thought everything would be smooth sailing from there. How wrong I was.\n\nAfter 30 minutes of troubleshooting a variety of weird router errors, I decided to bite the bullet and call tech support. After going through the basics, describing the problem that is currently in my way and cycling the power on the router, the tech and I settle down for 2 hours of repeated software resets and debugging program sweeps of my poor router, with nothing showing up. She decides to give it up and passes me off to her superior. This is where things get fun.\n\nThe superior asks me for my credentials and account details, which I give. He informs me my account has not been activated, seeing as I asked for a rental router and had not picked it up. I tell him that I have, give him the router number, default code, and store that I got it from. He marks the router as having been sold from the store and activates my account, getting me online. I ask him to make sure all my other details are in order because at this point I am leery of sales. Understandably the tech is reluctant to do another departments job, but he agrees to at least make sure my e-mail is squared away so I can get contacted by the company. I signed up using &lt;Email@College.Edu&gt;, my email is listed as &lt;College@edu.com&gt;.\n\nThere is about a four second pause while I rest my head against a wall, still on the phone, and then the tech, with a combination of amusement and frustration, says \"How about we go over the rest of the details, ok?\" In the end, we spend another 45 minutes setting my account up the way it was supposed to be, and the details that were correct were: My address. That is all.\n\nAfter this ordeal I thank the senior tech and say \"As much as I appreciate your dedication, I am sure I can speak for both of us when I say I hope that we never talk to each-other again.\" to which I get a hearty \"Amen.\" followed by a click.",

        "text": "This is going to be long, so apologies. \n\nJanuary 15th here in Ireland was icy. I found three icy patches on my 20 minute walk to my bus stop. I got on my bus, as I do every morning. I got the 8am bus, and knew that I would be in work for 8.30am, so I could relax before I started at 9am. And hey, if the ice slowed us down, well, I still had plenty of time. \n\nMy stop was in a business park near an airport. The bus driver refused to go into the business park because of \"health and safety\". It wasn't gritted, he said. Therefore all of us passengers had to get out of the bus outside of the business park, cross four lanes of traffic and traverse this business park that we had been told was deathly icy..\n\nI cross the four lanes of traffic. I get onto the path inside the gate of the business park. A path that has not been used before this day, to my knowledge. I can see grit on the road. I can see cars having no issue driving in. The path feels a bit slippy. I turn to walk out onto the road where it isn't slippy. I fall....and break my wrist. \n\nTurns out this was the only path in the business park not gritted as well... it is never used. All roads and paths that are used even sometimes were gritted. \n\nI decided to email our bus company with a complaint. I outlined what happened. I am polite, I am clear in what happened. I don't bullshit anything. I have checked with colleagues, who confirmed that the 7.30am bus and the 8.30am bus both entered the business park. \n\nI hear nothing about the complaint for over two weeks, so I contact the company on Facebook. Privately, as I'm not one to cause a public scene without need. I point out that the website says that I will be contacted in 15 business days. There are three more business days left. I get an email 6 minutes before close of business on the 15th business day asking for my phone number.\n\nAnother two weeks passes without contact. And this evening, I arrive home to a final resolution email. No one has actually bothered to call me.\n\nThe resolution email is frankly, insulting. Please read:\n\n&gt;Thank you for your e-mail to Bus Company Customer &gt;Care in relation to our Route [#x] service to Destination &gt;on 15th January, 2016.\n\n&gt;At Bus Company we endeavour to provide the best &gt;service possible to our customers.  The safety and well-&gt;being of our customers is our highest priority, and in &gt;order to ensure customer safety, we must, on occasions, &gt;adapt our services where operating conditions pose a &gt;potential risk to our customers and staff.\n\n&gt;On the morning in question, severe weather led to &gt;hazardous road conditions which had an adverse effect &gt;on our services.  Early morning services did operate into &gt;Destination, but encountered dangerous road conditions. &gt;After very serious consideration, the area was deemed &gt;unsuitable for buses and a supervisory decision was &gt;made to withdraw services from the Destination as a &gt;matter of safety.  As a result, the driver of the 08.00 &gt;service was operating under instruction not to serve the &gt;Destination.  The area remained under review and when &gt;road conditions improved, our services returned to the &gt;Destination.\n\n&gt;Please be assured that the decision to withdraw services &gt;from an area is made only after very serious &gt;consideration of safety aspects including the risk to the &gt;safety of passengers and staff alike.  We are aware that &gt;such decisions can lead to inconvenience for our &gt;customers, but every effort is made to keep such &gt;inconvenience to a minimum.\n\n&gt;Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention and I &gt;trust that this clarifies the matter.\n\nSo... basically, services were removed for one bus only. And apparently letting passengers walk on what is perceived to be a very icy area is considered a safety precaution. Additionally, no reference was made to the fact that this resulted in my breaking my wrist. It seems to have been considered an acceptable \"inconvenience\". On top of all of this, we were never provided with the information that the driver would NOT be stopping at my destination, thereby not giving me (and others) the opportunity to arrange alternative transport, such as a taxi.\n\nI will be pushing this complaint to the regulating body for our public transport as I am far from happy with this response. I work in a different heavily regulated industry and we have standards for handling complaints, such as.. referring to important details of the complaint when sending a resolution letter. Apologising when in the wrong. \n\nI was out of work for a week and a half instead of 6-8 weeks. I work on a computer all day. I was not able to properly perform my job to the best of my ability, but I went back because I couldn't afford to be out of work for longer than a week and a half.\n\nEven though I could have, I made no threat to sue or take legal action. Am I over reacting in not being happy with this response to a complaint about not being brought to my destination, which resulted in a broken wrist during icy weather? I know that, had I been brought to my correct stop, this would never have happened.",

        "text": "This is a tale of how an innocent transaction lead to an argument in a store full of people.   Lately I have been working on my appearance.  I have been working out and eating right and due to my hard work I have lost weight and am now in need of clothing for a smaller size.  Being super proud of my accomplishment I decided to go shopping at the mall.  Unfortunately, I don't like to shop alone.  Therefore, because all my female friends were unavailable I called one of my guy friends to go with me.  I may have omitted the fact that we were going to the mall before going to a show but he didn't fight too strongly.  \n\nSo to set the scene my friend is a 6'2 Viking full beard and tattoos covering more than 60% of his body.  He is carrying my bags and generally ticked off about having to visit places like forever 21 and Maurice's, but he's playing along fairly well.  We enter this particular clothing store and he beelines for a chair near the changing room.  He then puts out his \"do not bother me sign\" and pretends to fade into the background.  I then start looking for pants. I selected no fewer than twenty different kinds in various sizes and types. \n\nSeeing me drowning in denim he reluctantly makes his way over and relieves me of my burden as I flit off in search of more.  He proceeds to find a clerk and requests a dressing room.  The clerk looking around to find his female companion and comes up empty as I am in an entirely different section.  She then asks my friend his name and to her credit barely bats an eyelash as she writes it on the door and ushers him into the room.  Taking full advantage of the clerk's mistake my friend starts asking her which style she thinks will accentuate his figure best as I return and rescue the poor girl who is trying her best to remain professional.  Having chastised my friend I try on my plethora of pants and choose a couple with accenting tops.  \n\nI then join the line of waiting patrons. Once my turn comes the clerk asks for my reward card. I give it to her.  Then in the most chipper fake retail voice she informs me that the rewards policy has changed!  Oh joy!  Not really I very, very rarely patronize this particular shop and only signed up for the rewards card to shut up the last overly chipper sales clerk.  So I'm not exactly interested in the 'new' program but figuring she has to tell me about it I patiently wait as she starts in on her pitch.  \n\nNow previously the program was that for every $10 spent you receive a point and after 10 points you save $10.  Well, she is now overly happy to inform me that for every $1 I spend I receive 1 point and for every 75 points I save $5.  She beams at me from ear to ear at delivering this news. I turn to my friend and quietly said \"That's not better\". Apparently this is the bell for her to come out swinging.  She then begins explaining to me how this is so much better because I'm earning so many more points per transaction. After listening to her drivel for about two minutes longer than I should have I just said \"ok whatever what's my total\". This is not enough of a clue for her as she doubles down to convince me that this is so much better!  \n\nMeanwhile, the line behind me is growing and my friend is getting angrier by the moment at the way this lady is talking to me.  \nI look at her and say \"So what you are saying is in order to get the same amount of discount I have to spend $50 more.\"   \n\nShe then says \"But if you spend $500 you get an additional $5 off!\"  \n\nI then say \"If I'm already spending $500 I don't think that $5 is going to make a big difference.  And besides I already have the rewards card so you really don't need to try to persuade me.\"\n\nNot taking the hint she once again tries telling me how much better this is.  I finally snap and become that customer. \n\n\"Lady I am a math teacher just stop.\"\n\nShe doesn't stop. \"Well then you should know how wonderful this new program is...\"\n\nMe: \"Listen don't spit in my eye and tell me it's raining.  Can I have my receipt?  There is a whole line of people who are waiting and I'm not trying to argue with you I just want to leave.\"  \n\nShe then hands me my receipt and points and says \"See look how many points you already earned!\"  With a grin like the mad hatter. I just left. \n\nTl:dr;  clerk spends ten minutes trying to convince me how great a rewards program I already have is. ",

I've been working like crazy to get a good inventory built up, and one of the last things I needed to make were Star Wars blankets.\n\nMy local fabric store stocks a really nice, fluffy fabric printed with Star Wars characters. It's heavy and warm and easy to make throws out of.\n\nI go to this fabric store a lot, so I know that you need to take a ticket to get your fabric cut. I was planning to buy an entire bolt of fabric, but I still needed to have it measured and priced at the cutting counter before I'd be able to pay for it, so I took a ticket and I waited. When my number was called, I scurried over with my bolt.\n\nThe cutting table lady was talking to a rather confused, meek older woman who was saying that she'd thought she was next. The cutting table lady explained that she needed to take a ticket. The meek woman looked lost, so I helpfully pointed and said \"The ticket machine is over there.\"\n\nThe cutting counter lady glared at me like I'd just slapped her mother. \"I believe this woman was here first.\"\n\nI was taken aback, because it had sounded to me like she wasn't going to serve the meek woman because she didn't have a ticket. \"Oh. Okay; she can go first.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" The cutting table lady was having none of it. \"Just give me the bolt!\"\n\nI gave her the bolt and asked her how much it would be for all of the fabric. As she began to unwind the bolt to measure it, the fabric fell into two pieces. I said \"Oh!\" again, in surprise.\n\nThe cutting table lady grabbed the cardboard that the fabric had been wrapped around and thrust it at me, pointing emphatically to where \"Pieces\" had been written on it in small pencil letters. \"Did you even read this?\"\n\nI said that I hadn't read it because I'd gotten it off the shelf and remnants were usually stocked separately. The cutting table lady rolled her eyes at my incompetence and long-sufferingly went and got me a different bolt of Star Wars fabric. She asked me how much I wanted.\n\n\"Well, how much for all of it?\"\n\n\"I have to *measure* it first, honey.\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah...I'd like you to measure all of it and let me know how much it'd be.\"\n\nShe measured the fabric in stony silence, printed my ticket, and thrust it at me. I asked, again, how much it would be.\n\n\"They'll tell you at the register. I need to help the next woman now.\"\n\nThe price at the register turned out to be higher than I'd been anticipating, and I might've told her to knock a few yards off if I'd known what it was. ",

We both usually get the same thing and the total is just under $40.\n\nSo today we decided to stop in rather then cook at home and everything was fine until our waitress came over to our table. She was pleasant enough and we ordered our drinks. During the time she was away we had decided to get an appitizer along with our food as neither of us had eaten much that day.\n\nWe go to order our food and the train wreck begins. We ordered loaded fries with the sour cream on the side as an appetizer. I order my usual burger, no onion as that is all that comes on it besides cheese. The waitress then checks that I said no mushrooms, which doesn't even come on the burger to begin with and asks what type of cheese, chedder or american....even though the burger comes with swiss. My girlfriend orders steak and wasen't asked how she wanted it cooked, what sides she wanted, and I hadn't been asked that either at this point. We both figure that she was probably new, she was all over the place, but it wasen't a problem. Later we found out that she isn't new and actually has been working there at least a few months now.\n\nFast forward roughly 20 minutes we are waiting for the appetizer still and we started to doubt it would ever arrive, or probably come with the food. Another few minutes pass and she brings out our food, but no appetizer. We mention it and she said that they are in the window, she will go grab them now. Jump ahead a bit more and we are about halfway thru eating, still no appetizer and my girlfriend was out of soda. She comes over and askes if she wants a refill, my girlfriend says yes, and the cup is wisked to narnia never to be seen again.\n\nCome the end of our meal, we are both rather full and still have a bit of food left to take home so we ask for boxes. Rather then return with the boxes first, she returns with the plate of fries we had wanted as an appetizer after we finished and better yet it had sour cream on top.... We inevitably told her we no longer wanted it which was fine, she took it off the bill. Returned with boxes and the bill, everything looked to be in order. The service was rather crappy, but one time isn't going to stop us from going there. \n\nHere is my favorite part though. We get up to go pay the bill at the front, a different girl is working the register. The total was $37.62, which is fine, I hand her my card, she swipes it, types in the numbers, pushes the green button, then begins furiously mashing the red button. She didn't bother to say anything to me until the approved appeared and the recipt printed, to which she replied \"Oh shit\". My bill went from being $37.62 to $376.22 because she didn't notice she hit the number too many times until after. The manager came over and voided the transaction, but because it cleared, the money is still being held until the void clears. The only thing I got from all of this was a half hearted shrug and a half-assed apology. I still paid full price for the meal, crappy service and all. ",

        "text": "Greetings my fellow travelers.  Tonight's tale comes from two encounters which have made me reevaluate my stance on piss bottles. \n\nMy first encounter with the convince clerk who will be forever entitled Rude Rudy began several months ago.  I sing in a rock band that happens to be located in a large city about four hours from where I reside.  I may or may not choose to travel this far simply to avoid anyone I know from witnessing my attempt at playing rock goddess. Because I am involved in this extracurricular pastime I travel often through the barren wasteland that is western Kansas.  Anyone who has ever attempted this feat will tell you, that four mind numbing hours of driving, is akin to being stuck in an elevator with six large smelly women who have just left a particularly garlicky dinner, for four hours while listening to the Muzak rendition of crocodile rock on infinite repeat.  In other words it sucks.  \n\nBeing as there are very few places to stop on this journey through hell, I always stop at a gas station in Larnard, and yes it is impossible to say that name correctly.  This particular instance I stopped to get gas on my way home as there are no gas stations for the next two and a half hours on the route.  After filling up my tank and paying at the pump I jumped in my car and began to leave when the thought hit me that I should probably use the facilities as squatting on the side of the road is not exactly high on priorities list.  So I pull up and park and wander in.  I use the restroom and begin to make my way back out to my car.  \n\nAt this point I meet Rude Rudy.  Rudy is the only other person in the station.  He is manning his counter and as I make my way out of the store he hails me.  \n\nRR: \"Hey aren't you going to look around the store?\"\nMe:\"No thanks. I have everything I need!  Have a nice evening\"\nRR: \"So you aren't even going to buy a drink or anything?!\"\nMe:\"No thanks I have one in the car.\"\nRR: \"So what? You just use the bathroom and leave!?\"\nMe: \"I already purchased gas at the pump.\"\nRR: \"So?  You came inside and used the bathroom!  You should purchase something to pay for the use of the restroom!\"\n\nAt this point I just walked out. Now I can understand if this was a small mom and pop shop but it is a national chain that is connected to another chain with a loyalty card which I used when paying at the pump. I just let it go and made the decision not to stop at this particular station again as I did not appreciate being yelled at. (And yes he was yelling)\n\nFast forward to this weekend.  I once again returning home at a very late hour. It was around 3:30am when I hit the city limits. As I slowed down to a crawl of 20 miles an hour through the abandoned streets I notice a patrol car sitting in a parking lot. As I crept by I saw him turn on his headlights (not his pulling me over lights) and start following me.  Keeping my speed well under the limit and my hands on ten and two I continued through town as the officer followed me at a creeping pace.  After about ten blocks I saw the station I didn't want to return to. Deciding that I didn't want to give the officer ten more blocks to find a reason to pull me over before I reached another gas station I figured I'd roll the dice and stop. \n\nI entered the store to find that Rude Rudy was at the helm. There was also another patron in the store as well. I used the restroom and then in order to avoid confrontation I picked up a drink and a snack. I walked up to the counter and pay and this happened.\n\nOther Customer:\"Hey how's it going?\"\nMe: \"Not too bad. Just a little tired it's a really long drive home\"\nOC: \" Yeah not much scenery out here at night nothing really happens around here it's pretty boring\"\nMe: \"I could tell!  I turned into town and a police officer was so bored he followed me doing 15 all the way here!\"\n\nWe chuckled having a nice conversation. And suddenly;\n\nRR: \"WELL WHAT DID YOU DO?!\"\nMe: \"huh?\"\nRR: \"Are your tags expired?!  Do you have a warrant?  You must be drunk and swerving all over!  I can tell you are a criminal!\"\n\nAt this point OC and I are struck dumb at the blatant audacity of RR. OC finds his voice first and tries to be a white knight. \n\nOC: \"Jesus Randy chill.  I'm sure she didn't do anything.\"\n\nNot to be deterred RR continues on with his rant. \n\nRR: \"Well, YOU MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING!  I should call the cops right now!  Are you planning on stealing something? What were you doing in the bathroom?  Trying to flush your drugs?\"\n\nAt this point I have already paid for my snacks and with a final stupefied glance at OC I walked out with RR yelling at me the whole way out.  I will never stop there again, I would rather pee on the side of the road.  \n\nTL;DR:  Gas station Nazi looses his mind over two customers having a friendly conversation. ",

I called my bank, explained this to them, and they reversed the charges.  I've gone in since, and the people I experienced are no longer working there.  This is, by far, the worst customer service I've ever gotten.  \n\n",

I was really worried about my dog overheating and started googling ways to keep her cool while she was stuck outside all day while I worked. She had shelter and heaps of water but I wanted to see what else I could do. I found that there's these cooling mats for dogs to sit on, usually made of gel.

My partner and I went in to find out if they had any. \n\nWe got there and asked a staff member.\n\nStaff: Um no we don't sell those.\n\nMe: ..well it's on your website so maybe it's something that has to be ordered in or available at another store..? \n\nStaff: (laughs and looks at us like we're complete idiots) No I mean we don't sell them at all, I don't think that even exists.\n\nWe decided maybe they just didn't know and tried another staff member.\n\nStaff2: (laughs out loud) What?

        "text": "First time posting here, frequent reader.\n\nHaving previously worked in retail and still currently working in retail, I know how it feels to be on the other side of the counter and am generally nicer to retail workers. I know what often creates trouble or is an annoyance for them since I have to deal with that most of the time myself. However, there were a few times that I was met with rudeness from a retail worker that I felt was unwarranted.\n\nOne example would be when I was purchasing a simple chocolate chip cookie from a popular coffee company. This happened last fall I believe, on a weekday morning at the foodcourt inside a mall, as I had some time before waiting for the bus to University.\n\nI had received an e-gift card from Corporate, which I had already used once at another location of said coffee company close to my campus. I received the credit because I had a credit card that was affiliated with the coffee company that was newly introduced at the time, but there was a mistake on their end, and to apologize for the inconvenience that was caused, they offered to send an e-gift card to me, which I loaded on their app in my phone. I did not request for the credit, they gave it to me when I called about the error regarding the credit card asking for it to be fixed.\n\nAnyways, I was sure there was enough remaining credit on the e-gift card when making the purchase, but for some reason, the machine wasn't reading the balance on my e-gift card. Every time the cashier scanned it, it wouldn't go through. There were two machines at the location, and I asked the cashier if I could try my e-gift card with the other cashier, because sometimes machines have errors, it happens. The cashier flat out refused and questioned if I even have enough money on it, and that I was not allowed to line up with the other cashier to try their machine. I just wanted to spend the remaining value on it, I don't see what the hassle was, it wasn't like she had to void out a large order, and I asked nicely. She made it seem as if I was causing trouble for her by not paying by other means. I looked at her and she glared at me and just kept scanning my e-gift card over and over again, and a receipt showing the balance could not be read would pop up each time. She did this quite dramatically, and soon a line of receipts of perhaps eight to ten of them popped up. I was willing to wait patiently for the other cashier too, as they were at that moment occupied with another customer but would soon be done. \n\nTo add more detail to how the set-up was like, it was two cashiers, but one line. So there weren't two lines, one for each cashier, that kind of thing.\n\nI was just caught off guard by the whole interaction, and it was my only day off work that week too, so to have to feel like that on a day when I wasn't facing customers myself, it was very off-putting. I decided that since she wasn't willing to let me try my e-gift card in the other lane, I would just forget about my order and leave. The man in front of me insisted on paying for me, which I refused several times, because it's not that I didn't have money, I just wanted to spend the value on the e-gift card. The man then paid for the item despite my refusal, and handed it to me. I thanked him, felt very embarrassed about the whole situation, and then left to go take the bus to my class.\n\nI was upset about how the cashier treated me over something so simple. I completely understand that sometimes people are stressed out from serving long lines of customers. I feel that way too. Sometimes people have to go to work when they are having a bad day. It's not really an option to decide to not show up to work, unless you want to not have that job anymore. Some workers are burned out from their retail jobs.. but I don't treat the customers I have to deal with like that, especially if they are polite with me. If they have an issue, I usually go beyond to try to help them. I am exhausted most of the time at work as well. In the end, I still felt really upset by how the worker humiliated me, so I complained to the manager, it's one of the very few times I've ever complained about a worker at a retail establishment. The manager did not seem to care, but put on a show so as to appease corporate, to avoid issues. I now rarely frequent that location even though it is very convenient for me and I used to go there sometimes, because most times I passed by, I would see that cashier again and I didn't want to have to deal with her. So that was my experience of bad customer service.",

        "text": "Per request, this is my second story from a large US pet/pet supply store. [My first one is here :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/49nfn4/i_know_where_the_birds_are_im_trying_to_let_you/)\n\nThis happened just a few days ago. I frequently go to this store to visit with the shelter cats. I usually ask permission from a store employee before going into the cat room, but none of them ever seem to mind considering the cat cages are locked and you can easily see into the cat room. It is also not at all unusual for people to ask to go into the cat room. \n\nFor clarity's sake, the cat cages make up the outer wall of the cat room. Facing out into the store are clear windows so people can see the cats and easily into the cat room, and the locked cage doors face into the cat room. \n\nSince the cats are there through the local animal shelter, volunteers from said shelter work with the cats rather than employees of the store, and subsequently they also have more authority over the cats. On this particular day, a volunteer was there. I struck up a conversation with her, she welcomed me into the cat room, chatted with me about the cats, and even let me babysit a loose kitty while she was busy. (So it was a good time for me, as a cat lady and all)\n\nThe volunteer eventually started getting ready to leave, and she left the room for a few minutes, leaving me alone with the cats who were all in their locked cages at this point. I was playing with them through the cage doors with one of those stick toys, when an employee I've never seen before saw me and stopped dead in her tracks to stare at me through the windows. I smiled, but it was one of those instances where someone doesn't respond to the polite \"stop looking at me\" smile and just keeps looking at you. \n\nWell, apparently I, a 21 year old girl dangling a cat toy for the cats and giggling like a little kid at how cute they were, looked threatening or up to no good to this employee, Blonde Pixie (BP). \n\nBP finished staring at me after a few uncomfortable minutes, only to begin yelling at every other employee within 20 feet. \n\n\"Do you know this girl?!\"\n\n\"Hey, Other Employee, do you know who this girl is in the cat room?!\"\n\n\"Are you with this girl?!\" \n\n\"Who is that girl in the cat room?!\"\n\nObviously, this caused other customers to start looking at me and it was just causing a fuss. I just stood there, playing with the cats, kind of embarrassed and confused because no other employee has ever minded people playing with the cats. \n\nFinally, the volunteer came back and BP directed her panicked yelling at her\n\nBP: Did you know about this girl in the cat room?!\n\nVolunteer: Yeah... I told her she could go in there.\n\nBP: ...oh. \n\nThen BP wandered off, a vigilante in the world of pet supplies. \n\nAs I was leaving, I spotted BP and gave her a weird look. I would've said something like I come there all the time, but I figured her anticlimactic answer to who the hell was in the cat room was enough. \n\n**Edit:** (if this is against the rules, please tell me! There's no indentifying info here though) [Here are some pictures of a kitty](https://imgur.com/a/Efsz3) I took on that day. He was so cute! :)",

This particular night, the lone sandwich artist was a young, newer employee. The line is fairly long, but not as bad as it is some nights. \n  \nRG is a customer ordering a sandwich in line right in front of me. It is now RG's turn to start creating his dream sandwich. \n  \nLW: Sorry about the wait, what can I get you today?\n  \nRG: Jesus, about time. *looks at me and rolls his eyes* ... Yeah I'll take a roast beef on wheat. \n  \nLW: sure! And what kind of cheese would you like on that?\n  \nRG: is that all the meat you're going to put on there?? You need to put more meat on that. *looks at me* don't you think that's a ridiculously small amount of meat? Would you eat that??\n  \nMe: uhh.. \n  \nRG: (to me:) No, seriously. That is hardly any meat. Just tell me if you would eat that? (to LW:) you raise your fucking prices and them give the customer LESS meat?!? (to me:) seriously, isn't this ridiculous?!?\n  \nMe: I'm pretty sure the company decides the prices and how much meat you get, not him personally. He's just doing his job...\n  \nRG: Ugh, whatever. This is just ridiculous. So you think this is okay to just rip people off? \n  \nMe: umm... no... He's just doing his job. Please don't drag me into this. \n  \n  \nHe finished ordering his food, being an ass pretty much the whole time. Even shot me a dirty look when he was paying!   I don't understand why people take their frustrations out on the employees, especially when they are not the ones who make the rules!! ",

        "text": "This happened several months ago at a popular US pet/pet supply store. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were walking around looking at the rodents and birds, when we noticed one of the parakeets was belly-up, seemingly dead at the bottom of the parakeet cage. Figuring this was something employees should know about and something that wouldn't be nice for one of the many kids there to see, I went to find the nearest worker. \n\nI found Skeptical Lady (SL) an aisle away. \n\nMe: Excuse me, I think one of the birds over there is dead...\n\nSL: (furrowing her brow at me) What? Yeah, birds are over there. They're fine. \n\nMe: No, I think one of them might be dead. It's just laying in the cage. \n\nSL: (still scowling) What? Did you want to see one? \n\nMe: I'm pretty sure one of the birds is *dead*. \n\nSL then gave a half eyeroll and scoff before finally heading over to see what this Dumb Customer^TM (me) was so worried about the birds for. \n\nAs she went, Another Employee (AE) spoke up: What is it?\n\nSL: I don't know, she was talking about the birds.\n\nMe: (a little frustrated) I think one of the birds is dead. \n\nAE then followed SL to the birds and I watched as SL opened the door to the mini room behind the cages, muttered a slightly shocked \"oh\" once she saw what I was talking about, and scooped the undeniably expired parakeet out of its cage. AE stood there seemingly shocked as well, I guess they weren't used to stuff like that, but did I really have to repeat it that many times?\n\nI realize you work in retail, you have to deal with stupid people all day, but I doubt they're usually coming up to you telling you one of the animals is dead. I just found the reactions bizarre, like I was just supposed to ignore the dead bird (RIP).\n\n\n\n**Edit:** I have another story from this same store, caused by my ~~obsession~~ love for cats. Not crazy or anything but I'd be happy to share. :)\n\n**Edit:** [Link to the cat story!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/49qecb/code_red_stranger_in_the_cat_room/)",

        "text": "Background:  Last month, Super Bowl Sunday\n\nWith Valentine's Day approaching, I planned to give my boyfriend a poster-sized picture of London as a housewarming gift.  I went on the website of a well-known pharmacy's photo lab where website indicated an image meant for 26\"x40\" was able to be uploaded.  Since I was at work, I did this while I was on break and chose the location closest to me.  All that was left to do was to apply the 30% off promo code and choose my pick-up time.  Sweet deal, right?\n\nInstead, the system indicated my image was larger than the size I chose and scaled it down to 11''x14''.  Okay, fair enough. Once I reached checkout, I chose \"Pick-up at [location] between 4 and 8 pm\" since I would be done work by then.\n\nFast-forward to 5:50PM: I arrived, anxious to see what the poster would look like.  I walked in to a near-deserted store except for the employee I passed waiting in line with water. I went straight back to the photo lab and proceeded to wait.  \n\n...and wait.\n\n...and wait.\n\n...And I still waited.  Now I should mention that the employee I passed walked over to a coworker and gushed over something on her phone.  I was watching this whole exchange and growing more annoyed when the employee put her phone away and walked to me.\n\n&gt; E:  \"Are you being helped?\"\n\n&gt; Me: \"No, I've been waiting to pick up a photo.\"\n\n&gt; E:  \"Ok, I'll get someone.\"\n\nShe goes to a door secured with a keypad and calls back, \"Someone needs to pick up a photo\".  Then she disappears to the back of the store.\n\nIn all, I waited 15 more minutes for this mystery person to make their appearance.  I marched up to the un-enthused cashier, who then proceeded to call for assistance on the intercom.  Finally, the person from the secured room graces me with her presence and feigns, \"Oh! We're so *short-staffed*!\"  I had no sympathy and told her that I watched two of her coworkers dick around on a cell phone.  She gave a half-assed apology and asked for my name, but could not seem to locate my order in the bins.  It took her and the cashier to figure out that the photo printer set up for online ordering **was not working**.\n\nI'm tapping into patience reserves and tell her that I would appreciate a call from a store manager, and that it's not too much to ask for me to have my order free of charge.  She used my information in the system and said her district manager would call me right away. \n\nThe next day (Monday):  The manager in question *did* contact me, but it wasn't until almost 5:00.  I wasn't able to call back until after 5:30, where I spoke to an employee who told me the manager only stayed for 20 minutes.  I asked that they pass on that I called back, to which he responded that he was aware of the situation and apologized that I had to go through that.\n\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday...nothing. I decided not to follow-up and take my business up the road. Why should I have to keep playing telephone tag with these people? Since it didn't seem to matter to the manager, maybe corporate would be interested.  That night I drafted an e-mail and sent it.  I figured that if a detailed e-mail did not get their attention, then corporate was just as incompetent.\n\nLiterally a day went by and I received an e-mail from the manager of the store.  Long story short, they gave me this sweet line \"...and since I did not hear back from you and I got so busy, your order has sat here.\"  Well, since they put it that way, I responded:\n\n\"Hi [store manager],\n\nThank you for responding.  I returned your call Monday and spoke to _____, and he assured me that you would get the message.  As the week has gone by, I felt the same inattention was being shown to me and I took my business to [photo lab up the road].\n\nHave a great day.\"\n\nGoing somewhere else meant sending out the image and waiting three weeks, but the end result of seeing how happy my boyfriend was, was worth it.",

        "text": "I'd call it the worst dining experience ever but we didn't even get to dine. \n\nSo a couple friends and I went to this hip tiki restaurant for dinner before going to a theater show for the theater my friend performs at. \n\nWe get there around 5pm, and we have to use valet parking. It's a $5 charge, so fine. We walk in and there are three hostesses. The way this place is set up is you walk in a main level and then the eating areas/bars are upstairs and/or downstairs. They tell us upstairs isn't open, and to just go downstairs and seat ourselves. \n\nSo we go down there and it's jam packed. Every seat is taken, even the bar. The only way to get a seat is to roam around and wait until someone leaves. There are several people doing this, so it's all the luck of the draw. No matter who got there first, it's just if you happen to be near a table when the previous people leave, you grab it. \n\nWe walked around for about 10 minutes, and decided to go somewhere else. I felt it was rude to be hovering around the people eating like vultures, waiting for them to leave their seats, and the whole thing was a disorganized mess. We ended up deciding we were just going to find a place downtown, closer to the theater and eat there. \n\nWe decided to leave, and went back upstairs and asked the hostess if we could have a refund on our valet, since there were no seats and we had to leave. They would not even do that!! The whole thing was so disorganized and so not customer friendly. When we left there were at least 10 other couples wandering around looking for a seat. Not the best way to run a restaurant, IMO. And I have no idea what the 3 hostesses were there for, they did absolutely nothing.\n\nedit: clarification, no story content edited. ",

I like to make fun of my condition, so event didn't make me feel bad in any way... well maybe for him. \n\nAnyway.. The story:\n\n&gt;ME: Ello this is ME\n\n&gt;PS: Ello, this is phone seller, I can see you’ve subscripted to one of our magazines, and I wish to offer you a great deal, unique for previous customers\n\nTo be fair, they had often did some interessting subscription offers, where they throw a great book or a DVD pack in for less than 10$, along with their magazine, which tends to have some interesting content, so I would hear them out\n\n&gt;ME: Well, let me hear then...\n\n&gt;PS: Only today we can offer you 2 issues of the magazine \"Active training\", with an exclusive pulse monitor as a gift. Should I send you this offer to you right away sir?\n\nOhh, the of irony.. But as I don’t want the pushy seller to feel unnecessary cringe, I calmly, with a big smile, thus to the ironic situation, say \n\n&gt;ME: No thank you, it has no interests..\n\nBut as always, these sellers are in no way done with the conversation after the first no, and now the sellers is using his selling toolbox\n\n&gt;PS: This magazine will help you plan your training sessions, and bring you the latest news to stay healthy. Statistics say that the number of sick-days can be more than halfed, if your exercise daily, won’t you help out your boss with less days away from job?\n\n&gt;ME: Eh, yes but sorry, I'm not interested\n\nI would really feel bad to just end the conversation by force, one of my many faults. But this conversation gets even better! \n\n&gt;PS: You do know that according to statistics, people who don’t exercise, die years before healthy people?\n\nAt this point I almost couldn't handle the scream of laughter in my head, if I could I would’ve rolled around on the floor! He had basicly just told a disbaled guy that he will die younger becaurse of his lack of activity. With a fairly controlled giggle I say:\n\n&gt;ME: That makes sense, but it still has no interests.\n\nThe Phone seller is now out of ammo, and only have a shot of a sell if he can invert my reasons to decline\n\n&gt;PS: Can I ask why you aren’t interested in this great offer?\n\n&gt;ME: Well sir, I’m in a wheelchair, I can't move without help..\n\n&gt;PS: ...\n\nI don't think saw seen that comming, I sat and waited for the response, and it just got more fun the more silence there where. I’m not sure if he could hear me trying to control myself. Finally I felt like I just had to take control of this gem of a sell\n\n&gt;ME: heh well, I’m gonna hang up now..\n\n&gt;PS: ...\n\n&gt;ME: Bye\n\n&gt;PS: .. bye..\n\n*ClicK*\n\nThis was pure gold. I had a smile on my face that whole day.. I have told this story several of times to family and friends, and thought it make sense to share with you : )\n\n[Bonus joke which were made by Humon some time before the conversation](http://satwcomic.com/unfair-advantage)\n\n**TL:DR; Phone seller try to make potential customer feel bad about not working out, and says he’ll die younger if there is no exercise. Customer is disabled.**",

        "text": "This story is the update to https://redd.it/47gzcw cluck cluck nope.  \n\nLadies and gentleman I bring you continuance of the tail of our disillusioned heroine who only wanted to feed her children and collapse in bed.  Today was a difficult day to begin with. I started my day attempting to make good choices. I awoke early and for some insane reason I decided to walk to work. I live less than a mile from my school and I figured I should attempt to work off the contraband that my cookie dealer has guilt tripped me into.  Seriously, those little girls are pushy!  I start strong but a girl can only hold out for so long before she fears for her life at the little hands of girls in braids. \n\nAnyway, having purchased and consumed more cookies than I am comfortable sharing with complete strangers I chose to do the responsible thing and walk.  So here I am rocking out to my music and probably looking like I am having a seizure as I attempt to bust a move while walking down the street.  I make it about a block when I noticed a car following very slowly. In fear that I am about to become the victim of either a drive by, kidnapping, or being stalked by the ice cream man I turn around to find one of my students hanging out the window yelling \"Are you okay? Do you need a ride?\"  After assuring them I am actually choosing to walk I continue on my way. Only for this exact scenario to play out four times. Yes that's right in the seven blocks it takes to walk to work no fewer than five students stopped to ask if I needed help. I know that I'm a little bigger but damn I can walk a mile without passing out in the ditch.  Apparently this is hilarious to my friends in the office who were now expecting me to come crawling through the doorway.  Then I proceeded to do state testing for the rest of the day which anyone who has experienced this atrocity will tell you will make you practically suicidal. \n\nAfter walking home and once again turning down three offers for \"help\". I finally arrive to see a letter in the mail from the friendly southern man who sells chicken.  Yes!  Someone actually listened I have made a difference in the world!  Yeah right I wouldn't be writing this if they had enough sense not to poke the bear. I opened my letter to find myself in shock much like a child at Christmas who came down to find Santa passed out drunk in his underwear surrounded by reindeer poop.  Inside is the most patronizing and pathetic attempt at an apology I have ever witnessed.  First of all it is a form letter obviously meant for people who have had undercooked chicken. It specifically said \"We apologize that your experience did not meet your expectations\".  Seriously?!  I'm sorry I have such lofty expectations such as not having freaking cockroaches in my food!  Then the cherry on top was that they included a coupon for $5 off my next order. Yes five whole dollars!  You can't even buy anything there for five dollars!  Not that I would ever eat there again but really. Really?  It was like a slap in the face.  All I wanted was to have them acknowledge what happened and fix the problem. I didn't want anything I even told them I didn't want anything other than an apology and an assurance that they would clean the store. \n\nI was not about to take this offense lying down. I grabbed my phone and called corporate back. A very unimpressed lady answered my call and once again I explained the situation and that I just wanted to know something was being done. The lady informed me that the letter was just a form letter they always send out and she is \"sorry\" I was insulted and that they are looking into the issue. All of this is said in the same voice and tone like a 40 year old stripper telling her drunken John how 'sexy' he is. I'm even more upset as this lady tells me that she is not authorized to give me any more than five dollars. I don't want money I don't want chicken I just want you to acknowledge there is a problem that needs correcting. After five minutes of not getting through to this lady I request a supervisor who answers and before I can even explain the situation she begins telling me that she is afraid she cannot authorize any compensation. What!?  I'm livid at this point no one is listening I don't want your freaking chicken I wouldn't eat it if you brought it to my doorstep in a silver chalice. \n\nHaving exhausted my patience for stupidity early in the day my eye is twitching from holding on to my anger.  After another five minutes of the supervisor I snap. I tell them to take their chicken and coupons and stick them where the sun doesn't shine and inform them I intend to put on every single social network their complete lack of tact and cleanliness.  I informed them I'm going to call everyone I know and tell them about their total lack of cooperation or sense of responsibility. I tell them that I have given them more than ample time and leeway and they have insulted me for the last time. \n\nLess than an hour later I received a phone call from the district manager who is falling all over herself to apologize. Turns out that corporate had not followed up on my complaint and the manager had not said a word about it to anyone because he was afraid he was going to be fired. When the district manager called him the manager came clean and told her everything that happened. She begged me to reconsider and swore that not only was it being addressed immediately but that I would personally be kept informed of the progress and I would receive a copy of the review after the cleanup. I agreed that I would keep my peace for exactly one week and if in that time it was not addressed no amount of pleading would change my mind.  \n\nTl;dr. No amount of chicken is going to keep me from clucking. \n\nBONUS STORY!\n\nWhen I was fifteen my mother was driving about six of my friends and I to a competition. I had a snack cake and as I bit into it with relish I bit into a screw.  My mother who is very like me called the company to inform them that they might want to check their machines because she was afraid something worse would happen in the factory.  Having told them what happened they told her that it could never have happened and there is no way that something like that would get past their screens. My mother was extremely upset that they basically called her a liar and offered to get affidavits from every one of the seven other people in the van. \n\nAbout a week later we received a shipment of a dozen large boxes filled with every kind of snack cake the company makes and a check for three times the price of the snack. There was also a ziplock Baggie for the screw with a return envelope and a form that basically said we agreed not to sue the company or tell anyone about what happened. We refused to sign and my mom said that we should send back the bribe.  The company also called and apologized to my mother.  She felt the apology was enough but us kids enjoyed the treats more. \n\nTl:dr got screwed by a snack cake company and then was paid off like a cheap hooker with snack cakes. ",

        "text": "Last night I decided to forgo the usual home-cooked meal as it was late and I really felt like having a take-out.  On the main road round the corner from me are no less than six different fast food places - 2 Chinese, a fish shop, one that does chicken, one Indian and one pizza place.  In fact, if you walk an extra five minutes there are even more.\n\nI go to the pizza place, and there's a young girl on the counter and the first thing that strikes me about her is that she's very politely spoken, clearly pronouncing all of her words.\n\nIt's almost like English isn't her first language and she's attempting to hide her natural accent by using the [received pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation) accent.  She takes my order, but then turns to one of the guys in the shop who (and no, I'm not being racist) barely speak english.  Judging by the flag at the rear of the shop, they're from Jordan.\n\nHer words are:\n\n&gt;I no use this screen.  Is Blank.  You need to fix before I use.\n\nShe turns back to me and hands me my change, saying:\n\n&gt;Here is your change.  twenty-five pence.  Your meal will be with you shortly.\n\nBack to the kitchen guys and says:\n\n&gt;This order Delivery, this order that gentleman's.  You do gentleman's order first, yes?\n\nI still have no idea if she was talking down to the non English staff, or if English wasn't her first language",

        "text": "Hi everyone. Long time reader, first time poster. I have a small business and usually post in Tales From Retail, so I especially hate complaining about an employee or experience I've had at another retail store. This was, however, share-worthy. \n\nI hand make the majority of the items for my business, and as such, I use a lot of fabric. Several different stores - both craft stores and regular retail stores - in my area offer a wide variety of fabrics, and I had gone to one to pick out fabric to make some flowers with. My mom was with me, and between the two of us, we spent well over a half an hour picking out several different fabrics, figuring out what we could get on the budget I had, and deciding what would sell better and create the best flower. \n\nWe got to the cutting counter just after another female customer, and it was clear she was already deeply frustrated by the employee cutting fabric. We soon found out why. We couldn't figure out if the woman at the counter had no idea what she was doing, or if she knew and was hoping if she acted like she didn't that we would just leave. \n\nShe would pick up a bolt of fabric, start to measure it, stop, write something down, measure some more, and repeat. Then she would forget what she had measured and do it all over again. At first we thought her scanner wasn't working and she was writing down SKU numbers and keeping track of what she was cutting, but it turned out it was working just fine. She also seemed to have little understanding of what a yard was, so much so that the woman who was getting her fabric cut ended up coming back behind the counter and showing the employee how and where to cut the fabric. \n\nThe other customer wanted all of one of the fabrics. When the employee started unrolling the fabric to cut it, she realized there were two pieces of the same fabric on the bolt. The employee then insisted that she had to go and find out what had happened to the fabric. The customer finally convinced her that it didn't matter - she wanted it all, but by this time several minutes had gone by. The employee then stated that she had no way of measuring and selling her two different pieces of the same fabric, therefore, she couldn't have the fabric. Very slowly and sweetly, the customer explained that all she had to do was measure one piece, scan the barcode, and put that amount into the scanner, then do the same with the second piece, essentially treating it as if it were two separate pieces of fabric. The employee was befuddled by this and the customer physically ended up picking up the scanner and doing it herself.\n\nEverything the employee did was in super slow motion. She would stop every so often and stare off into space and just completely ignore everyone around her. She was a middle aged lady - not old enough to be a little old confused lady. She also seemed to be a native English speaker, so the issue didn't appear to be a language barrier. \n\nIt got to the point where the customer politely asked the employee to please call someone else to cut the fabric. The employee gave her a kurt, \"No,\" and then went back to staring off into space somewhere. The customer asked for a manager, which the employee also refused to call. \n\nAfter fifteen minutes, four of the seven fabrics in the customer's cart had been cut. I had three times that many fabrics that I needed cut, so I ended up deciding against getting the fabric, which was upsetting, because by this time I had wasted a good 45 minutes of my time picking it out and waiting at the cutting counter. I was not rude to the employee. In fact, I said nothing to her at all. We silently put my fabric back and left. I've been buying fabric on a weekly basis for years now and have never had to walk away from a cutting counter because of an employee. \n\nMaybe this woman was new and simply didn't know what she was doing, though I've had my fabric cut by people in different departments that weren't trained to cut fabric and they did it just fine. Maybe she was having a bad day. Maybe she didn't understand what she was doing, and it was the management's fault for leaving her on the counter herself. However, it's up to the management to ascertain if an employee is capable of doing a job or not. Not everyone is cut out for every job, and perhaps this just was not the job for this specific employee. I can be patient and understanding of all of those things. What was upsetting was that, when the other customer asked her to please call someone else over and to call a manager, she flat out refused. We walked off to look for a manager, but were unable to locate one. \n\nI did go back the next day and get the fabric. The same employee was there with another employee, who happened to be the manager of that department. I very politely pulled the department manager aside, asked her if she could please cut my fabric and made her aware of what had happened the day before. The poor girl, bless her heart, just shook her head and said, \"She's been here a year and does that all the time, and I don't have the power to do anything about it.\" My heart goes out to that employee, because the look on her face told me it wasn't any easier to work with her.

        "text": "Hello /r/TalesFromTheCustomer!\n\nI'm a frequent lurker on this site and first of all, I'm deaf and I have worked in retail for almost 10 years and I have enjoyed reading a lot of stories from /r/TalesFromRetail, /r/TalesFromTechSupport and this subreddit, because I can relate to half of the stories I read! I do have some stories to share about my experience working in retail, but that will be for later. \n\nI'm here to share what happened to me recently, as a customer. My family and I occasionally enjoy a late indulging dessert from the restaurant with the freckled girl who looks like Pippi Longstocking with the subliminal \"Mom\" message on her collar. Alright, I get it, you know who I'm talking about. \n\nThe lobby was already closed so I had to go to the drive thru to order, otherwise I would have walked in and ordered from inside. I usually skip the speaker (or intercom?) because of me being deaf and drive up to the window. I am also a frequent patron of that location and practically everyone knows me there. When they see me, they know what to do by how to communicate with me and I usually have a piece of paper with my order written on it then I hand it to the cashier. There has not been a problem in the past.  \n\nHowever, this time it was different because there were new employees working the closing shift. There was one vehicle in front of me so I had to wait some time before my turn comes up. While I waited, I was looking at the window and I saw the cashier glancing into my direction and she appeared very concerned because of the furrowed brow look on her and the alternating between looking at me and looking into the kitchen, talking to someone I assume. I didn't really look into this too much and I just shrugged it off until my turn came up. Then I realized what was going on when I pulled up.  \n\nAs I drove up to the window, the cashier stepped away from the window and there was this hulking 6 foot 3 something tall employee with tattoos on his arms and he leaned toward the window, obscuring the cashier. I was a little puzzled but when the cashier spoke from behind, \"May I help you?\" I quickly said, \"I'm deaf\" verbally and gesturing to my ear with my index finger at the same time, to emphasize that I'm deaf. \n\nThe minute they found out that I'm deaf, they jerked their heads back in harmony, showing signs of relief and probably saying \"OH!\" (I saw their mouths opened up while jerking back). I handed the hulking employee my piece of paper and he took it with a smile on his face, as opposed to the stern look on his face before he found out that I am deaf. He read out loud my order to the cashier, but the cashier was fumbling through the touchscreen as she was visibly shaking as I could tell her index finger was shaking while hovering on the touchscreen and she was fidgety. \n\nAfter a while of fumbling around, she called for the manager to come around to override the system. She told me my total and I handed her the money then it took some time for the manager to open the till. Finally, he resorted to using his keys to open the till manually and I got my order soon after I got my change and drove away. The cashier waved good bye to me and as I drove away, I thought about what happened recently and it hit me. \n\nThere was a robbery that took place at that location not long ago -- probably a few months ago. I think they thought I was about to rob the place because I skipped the speaker and went straight to the window, plus I was alone in my vehicle and I'm a man. From my perspective, it was a funny scenario to see but from their perspective, I can see why the cashier was scared and had to get the hulking employee to stand in front of her as this was something out of the norm for them. \n\n**TL;DR: Am deaf, went to restaurant to get dessert, bypassed speaker for the window, cashier mistook me as a potential robber and asked The Incredible Tatted Hulk to stand in front of her. After finding out I'm deaf, everyone were shaky but relieved and I got dessert for the family!** ",

So instead of running to the store when we realize that we're out of food, we place an online order with a local place which delivers pitas.\n\nThirty minutes past the time the food (two pitas and cookies) was supposed to arrive, no sign of them. The online site has been known to be faulty, so we give the place a call. I will be Me. The guy who answers will be Employee.\n\nEmployee: Hello?\n\nMe: Hi! I wanted to ask about my order. I placed it an hour ago and-\n\nEmployee: We're busy, it's been out for an hour.\n\nMe: Ok, I just wanted to make sure because I placed it online and I know that sometimes online orders don't go through.\n\nEmployee: It's been out for an hour. If there's nothing else, I gotta go. We're busy.\n\nEmployee: *hangs up*\n\nI'm fairly sure calling again tonight will lead to more of the same, so I figured I should call back in the morning, when they won't be busy and a manager will be there. For the record, the site stated that the food would arrive within 45 minutes, but it is a third party site. I have already paid, and tipped, by credit card.\n\nAm I over reacting?\n\nEdit: for clarity. Also, not from the US so a little confused.",

        "text": "Short one from last year when I was still going to college. Got an email notification relating to it, which reminded me of the story.\n\nDuring one of those many weekends where all my friends were either sleeping in past 2pm or working, I went out on a solo shopping excursion to a popular US clothing store with the same name as a type of eye makeup. This store, known for its almost constant sales and discounts, has a rewards card you can sign up for.\n\nWent through the store, grabbed my stuff, tried it on, got in line. My cashier turned out to be an older Indian lady who was as pleasant as could be throughout the transaction.....up until it was time for the rewards card spiel. \n\nLady: *rewards card spiel*\n\nMe: *politely as always, as I feel I don't go to the store enough to justify getting the card* No thank you, not today.\n\nLady: But you'll be saving so much money when you come here. You'll get a point for every dollar spent.\n\nMe: *polite again* Thank you, but I'm not interested in signing up today.\n\nLady: Are you sure? It'll be so easy to just sign up today and save yourself some money.\n\nMe: *still polite, but getting a bit annoyed* No...I'm good, thanks.\n\nLady: So you don't want to save money? *At this point, she sounded accusatory.*\n\nMe: Yes, but I'm not interested in signing up today.\n\nLady: It won't take long at all and you can save X money for X spent.\n\nMe: .....All right, I'll try it.\n\nYeah, I caved, but only because this little back-and-forth had been going on for longer than I'd expected it to go and I figured I could just cancel the damned thing later if I remembered to. It was free, but I didn't think it was too odd of me to say no to it, considering I didn't go shopping all that much unless it was for groceries. I also didn't want to look like -that- customer, because I know you have to upsell your ass off in retail nowadays. \n\nOh well. A year later, and I'm staring at these emails in my inbox wondering if I'll feel like shopping there again anytime soon.",

        "text": "Inspired by [this tale.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/47drbg/bad_late_night_delivery/)  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nBack in the day, a pizza shop in my college town had ice cream available for delivery.  We ordered some, and the guy on the phone - the shop owner - said it would be 45 minutes.  90 minutes later I called and asked what was up.  Owner guy said he only had one driver and \"it'll get there when it gets there\".  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nAnother hour later - 2 1/2 hours after ordering - I called to just cancel the damn thing, and he screamed at me \"YOU CAN'T CANCEL, I SENT IT OUT WITH MY DRIVER ALMOST AN HOUR AGO, AFTER YOU CALLED THE FIRST %&amp;-@ TIME, HE HAD 27 ORDERS TO DELIVER AND YOURS IS LAST BECAUSE YOU COMPLAINED!\" and hung up.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nA bit later the driver finally arrived ... with my completely melted ice cream, which I of course refused ... and it turned out he was a friend, same major, lots of classes together, etc.  He thought it strange when the boss told him to deliver the ice cream last.  When he heard my side of the story, he went back to the shop, dropped the empty delivery bags on the counter, told the boss what he thought of him, and quit. They were out of business in less than a year.  \nTLDR: Pizza shop owner couldn't customer-service his way out of a wet paper bag.\n\nEdit: word.",
