I start at the router and realize I never changed the default admin and password. . . that was tough to admit here. However after changing my PW (netgear apparently won't let me change a username from 'admin'), I decided to audit my logs and my stomach turned as I read the multiple DoS attacks that are currently happening from my network. For all I know maybe the guy is getting a kick from reading this post via a key logger who knows. not saying there is a key logger on my device but hey  . . .with my lack of knowledge . . who knows. So here is the meat and potatoes of my question/post :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How do I stop a DoS attack from occurring?\n2. How do I get back at this jerk off?\n3. What are some safeguards to secure a home network?\n\nPreferably I would like number 2 to be accomplished before 1. I figure I may have an advantage if I can view IP addresses in the log (I know I could be so wrong and dumb for my understanding in how this works but I am pretty fueled and everyone starts somewhere)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nexample of what I see in netgear router logs:\n\n\\[DoS attack: Illegal Fragments\\] from 192.1.71.48, port 0 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nits not just this there is also some called ping of death and they occur many times in single day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for any help in advance\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Now that I am starting college (Technical support/ cyber security course), my instructor (who has been training in cyber security for 3+ years so far) has told me that I should go with the cyber security degree and get the certs necessary for that career path while I'm studying and to take any IT job in the meantime until I am able to find an entry level security job.   \n\nWhat are the upsides/downsides of getting a degree in cyber security vs computer science for this career?  \n\nEdit:  Thanks for all the information.  I'll definitely be taking all of this into consideration.",

Offensive\n2. Defensive\n3. Information Assurance\n4. Threat Intelligence\n\nRoles that seem to be the main clusters. For example: which might have: a greater entry level requirement, scalable salaries, technical aspects, qualification requirements, and overall use by various sectors and industries? I have the rough outline of what they each do, it's the deeper, more nuanced, understanding of each and how they relate to each other and industry that I am attempting to reveal.  \n\n\nI've been silently lurking and searching in the background for a few months and seem to have hit a plateau of information availability.   \n\n\nThank you anyone in advance for helping out an enthusiastic, but very much on the outside of cyber security, soul!",

Read the rules below to do it properly.\n\nRULES :\n\n* No down votes.\n* No repeated resource comments (search before you post).\n* No comment threads (do not reply to comments). If you feel that a resource someone listed is worth up lifting, just up vote it.\n* One resource at a time. If you have a couple of books and other resources, do not list them all in a single comment. List each resource as a separate comment. No threading.\n* The format of listing should be like this - \\[BOOK\\]The Web Application Hacker's Handbook, where the resource type should be stated inside square brackets and name should follow it. Hyper link the entire text in case there's a link (Amazon, CTF, YT, etc).\n\nThis way, the resource with the most up votes will stay on top and newbies and beginners can easily start up with the resources with most up votes.

I currently work in the SOC and got my Sec+ a few months ago, but my passion has always been with Pen Testing and that was one of my end game goals. I am currently enrolled in the OSCP which is I find EXTREMELY challenging, and has decided to take this fall semester off to complete it and solely focus on it.\n\nI was curious though of looking into taking the PenTest+ by CompTIA, I thought it would complement the OSCP. I looked at the PenTest+ exam objectives and saw some things in it that weren't really covered in the OSCP too much, more towards the technical side of things, like what SOW is and etc. By no means am I saying the Pentest+ is better, or even comparable to the OSCP... I know the OSCP one of the gold standard certs in Pentesting, and I know it's only the beginner cert to the field. (I just felt like I needed to include that so I wouldn't get burned out by some people)\n\nHowever, I was wondering would studying for the PenTest+ with the OSCP be helpful? I think I could pass the exam in maybe a few weeks of studying? Doesn't seem to difficult honestly, however for me right now the PenTest+ would be a major investment and I wouldn't want to dump 400+ dollars into something that wouldn't help me. Additionally, would it be helpful for me in finding a job as a PenTester? I want to get into PenTesting ASAP and if this would help me find a better paying job and a position as a Pentester, the $400+ dollars would be more than worth it.\n\nEDIT: I should clarify I am already enrolled in the PWK for the OSCP but will be running out of lab time in a few days. I won't renew until I complete a few vulnhubs and Pentesterlabs. ",

I'm new to webapp testing so I wanted to get a few sites like this to play with.  \nI've done a few of the challenges and I'm stuck on one. It's a buffer overflow challenge. It requires you to use knowledge gained from a previous exercise's source code.  \nYou submit flag1 which is located somewhere within vuln1.txt. In the source code it's stated in the code that 42=vuln1.txt. I changed that to 2A and entered that into my printf string for netcat. What returned was a massive wall of text, which, when decoded from Base64 revealed the following:  \n\n\nELF\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0003\u0001@\u0004\b4x\u00114 (\u001c\u001b\u000644\u0004\b4\u0004\b \u0001 \u0001\u0005\u0004\u0003T\u0001T\u0004\bT\u0004\b\u0013\u0013\u0004\u0001\u0001\u0004\b\u0004\b,\f,\f\u0005\u0010\u0001\b\u000f\b\u0004\b\b\u0004\bT\u0001\\`\u0001\u0006\u0010\u0002\u0014\u000f\u0014\u0004\b\u0014\u0004\b\u0006\u0004\u0004h\u0001h\u0004\bh\u0004\bDD\u0004\u0004Ptd  \n؊\u0004\b؊\u0004\bDD\u0004\u0004Qtd\u0007\u0010Rtd\b\u000f\b\u0004\b\b\u0004\b\u0004\u0001/lib/ld-linux.so.2\u0004\u0010\u0001GNU\u0002\u0006\u0018\u0004\u0014\u0003GNU&amp;K|J$i\u000fN\u0006h\u0002\u000e\u0001\u0005# \u000e\u000f)\u001d\u001cKO\u0012H\u0012\u001a\u0012,\u0012C\u0012x !\u0012a\u0012&amp;\u0012f\u00123\u0012'\u0012\\[\u0012T\\`\u0004\b\u0004\u0011\u0019\u000b\u0004\b\u0004\u0011\u000flibc.so.6\\_IO\\_stdin\\_usedfflushexitsrandperror\\_\\_isoc99\\_sscanfputsprintfreadstdoutcloseopen\\_\\_libc\\_start\\_main\\_\\_gmon\\_start\\_\\_GLIBC\\_2.7GLIBC\\_2.0\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0003\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0010\u0017ii  \n\u0003\u0010\u0010ii  \n\u0002\u0004\b\u0006\u0006\\`\u0004\b\u0005\u000e\f\u0004\b\u0007\u0001\u0010\u0004\b\u0007\u0002\u0014\u0004\b\u0007\u0003\u0018\u0004\b\u0007\u0004\u001c\u0004\b\u0007\u0005 \u0004\b\u0007\u0006$\u0004\b\u0007\u0007(\u0004\b\u0007\b,\u0004\b\u0007 0\u0004\b\u0007  \n4\u0004\b\u0007\u000b8\u0004\b\u0007\f&lt;\u0004\b\u0007  \nS\b3\u0001\u001bt\u0005n\b\\[5\u0004\u0004\b%\b\u0004\b%\f\u0004\bh%\u0010\u0004\bh\b%\u0014\u0004\bh\u0010%\u0018\u0004\bh\u0018%\u001c\u0004\bh % \u0004\bh(%$\u0004\bh0%(\u0004\bh8p%,\u0004\bh@\\`%0\u0004\bhHP%4\u0004\bhP@%8\u0004\bhX0%&lt;\u0004\bh\\` 1\\^PTRhЈ\u0004\bh\\`\u0004\bQVh߆\u0004\bfffffff\u001c$ffffff\\_\u0004\b-\\\\\u0004\b\u0006w\u0001øtU\u0018\u0004$\\\\\u0004\bÍ\\\\\u0004\b-\\\\\u0004\b\u0002\u001f\u0001u\u0001útU\u0018D$\u0004\u0004$\\\\\u0004\bÉ'=d\u0004\bu\u0013U\b|\u0005d\u0004\b\u0001f\u0010\u0004\bt\u001ft\u0016U\u0018\u0004$\u0010\u0004\bysU\\]U\u0010EEE\u0010E\u0004  \nEE\u0001}\u0007vEU\b1UhL\u0004\b\u0004$\u001c\\`\u0004\b\u0004$D$\b\u0001ED$\u0004\u0004$y\u0018\u0004$\u0004\b\u0004$\u0001UD$\u0004\u0004$\u0004\b$$y\u0018\u0004$\u0004\b\u0004$\u0001D$\b\u0004D$|D$\u0004$\u0004$)y\u0018\u0004$\u0004\bI\u0004$\u0001m$\u0004$D$|\u0004$r$$\u0004$$X\u0004\b$T$\u0004\u0004$\\`\u0004\b\u0004$D$\bdD$\u0014D$\u0004\u0004$$$y\u0018\u0004$\u0004\b\u0004$\u0001D$xD$\bD$\u0004Ҋ\u0004\bD$\u0014\u0004$D$x;$u\u0014IP\u0004\b\u0004$k  \nT\u0004\b\u0004$\\\\ffUW1VS\u0005Õ\u0017\u001cl$0\f\b)\u0002t'D$8,$D$\bD$4D$\u0004\b\u00019u߃\u001c\\[\\^\\_\\]  \nS\b#\u0017\b\\[\u0003\u0001\u0002Security Innovation rocks!The dungeon shakes as the door opens.
