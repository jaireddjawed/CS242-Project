[{"title":"Pseudo-Science Creeping In","author":"eronanke","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/8zz534\/pseudoscience_creeping_in\/","text":"Hey, guys.\nI've noticed a strong uptick in 'controversial theories' and 'outsider evidence' and other pseudo-science posts. This subreddit does NOT allow for pseudo-science. Archaeology is a science, and therefore strives to reach the facts through rigorous examination of evidence and criticism. The sidebar notes this already. I wanted to get out in front and describe what the process is for attempting to combat them.\n\n1) If it's aliens or Atlantis or something to that effect, it's eliminated immediately. The automod has been tweaked to temporarily remove posts that include certain trigger words, and I remove or approve them when they hit my modqueue.\n\n2) If there is something that appears to be a genuine question where our readership can help steer someone in the direction of real information and studies, I currently let it slide. I tend to be generous in this regard, allowing the community to self-police.\n\n3) I don't moderate comments unless they are excessively offensive (ie, hate speech). I leave that to the community to self-police.\n\nSo, basically, if you see something that you think is BS, report it. You can also always message me, and I'll get to it ASAP, although \/r\/history and my other subreddits sometimes take up a lot of my modding time.\n\nOn the whole, this is an amazing space and I'm so grateful you're all here.

Here are this week's Top 5 ancient headlines:\n\n* [Archaeologists Find Evidence that Horseback Riding Began at Least 5,000 Years Ago](https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/science\/archaeologists-find-evidence-that-horseback-riding-began-at-least-5000-years-ago) \u2014 The earliest direct evidence of horseback riding was discovered in central Europe, indicating that the practice dates to *at least* 5000 years ago. Researchers examined 200 Bronze-Age skeletal remains looking for signs of riding, including telltale marks on hip sockets, thigh bones, and the pelvis. Of the 200 individuals, five were likely riders. These riders apparently belonged to a people called the Yamnaya, a fascinating culture that you might remember me touching on in issues [\\#27](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/p\/ancient-beat-27-symbolic-tusks-pyramid) and [\\#48](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/p\/ancient-beat-48-medicine-horns-legionary?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=764080&post_id=102774709&isFreemail=false&utm_medium=email). According to Alan Outram, \u201c*There is earlier evidence for harnessing and milking of horses, but this is the earliest direct evidence so far for horseback riding*.\u201d The researchers note that the Yamnaya were responsible for the spread of Indo-European languages and \u201c*reshap\\[ing\\] the genetic makeup of Europe*\u201d \u2014 horseback riding likely had a big impact on both. But it\u2019s important to note that very few of the Yamnaya actually rode.\n* [Archaeological Study Reveals that Collective Forms of Governance, Infrastructural Investments, and Collaboration All Help Societies Last Longer](https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2023\/03\/230303105213.htm) \u2014 A new study examined 24 ancient cities in Mexico to understand what helped certain cities to last longer than others. The researchers looked at a number of data points, from public architecture to economies to how rulers were depicted (hint: rulers depicted as larger-than-life were usually despotic societies while leaders who were masked or depicted in groups tended to share power). It turns out that the longest-lasting cities showed signs of collective forms of governance as opposed to autocracies and despotic societies. They also showed signs of infrastructural investments (e.g. central open plazas) and cooperation between households (e.g interconnected residential spaces) early on.\n* [\u2018Startling\u2019 New Evidence Reveals Gladiators Fought in Roman Britain](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2023\/mar\/04\/evidence-reveals-gladiators-fought-in-roman-britain) \u2014 A vase from the 2nd century CE that depicts gladiatorial combat was discovered in Colchester, England in 1853. New analysis shows that it was made of local clay and the inscription bearing the names of two gladiators was added *before* firing rather than afterward as had originally been assumed. This indicates that the names were part of the original design, so it was not created as a generic representation of gladiators. Therefore, the researchers reason that the event likely took place in Colchester. According to Frank Hargrave, \u201c*It\u2019s the only evidence of a Roman arena gladiator combat actually being staged in Britain. There are no written descriptions. The vase is such high quality that there\u2019s been a bit of snobbery, an assumption that it couldn\u2019t possibly have come from Britain, whereas all the analysis has now put that to bed*.\u201d The vase shares the story of two gladiators \u2014 the winner bears a name that indicates that he was likely from Africa. The owner of the vase who, for one reason or another, chose to commemorate the fight, was later buried with it.\n* [Colors on these Ancient Pots Hint at the Power of an Empire](https:\/\/www.ancientpages.com\/2023\/03\/07\/colors-on-ancient-pots\/) \u2014 A new study compared the colors of ancient Peruvian potsherds and found that the Wari empire used a distinctive black pigment for ceramics that were used in rituals. The exact formulation of the pigment varied slightly, but overall, it was very similar from site to site, indicating that there was a \u201ccorrect\u201d black pigment that the Wari wanted everyone to use. The researchers take this as a sign of the empire\u2019s influence. Some sites even had different recipes for black pigments which were then changed when the Wari came into power. Interestingly, though, what was depicted with the pigment varied from place to place. According to Muro Yno\u00f1\u00e1n, \u201c*In general in the Andean region, the color black is related to the ancestors, to the night, to the passage of time. In Wari times, the color was likely important for imposing a specific Wari ideology to the communities they conquered*.\u201d I covered the Wari culture briefly in the [previous issue](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/p\/ancient-beat-50-a-new-corridor-in), and interestingly, that story was also about the empire\u2019s influence.\n* [Early Reference to Norse God Identified on Gold Disc in Denmark](https:\/\/www.archaeology.org\/news\/11275-230309-denmark-odin-bracteate) \u2014 A runologist has discovered the first known reference to the Norse god, Odin, providing the first solid piece of evidence that Odin was worshipped at least as early as the 5th century CE. It is on an ornamental pendant known as a bracteate which shows the face of a man on it. Above the man, the runes apparently say, \u201c*He is Odin\u2019s man*.\u201d The bracteate was part of the 1,500-year-old Vindelev hoard that was found in Denmark in 2020.\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/).

Happy Saturday :) Here are this week's Top 5 ancient headlines:\n\n* [Scientists Reveal Hidden Corridor in Great Pyramid of Giza](https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/news\/world\/scientists-reveal-hidden-corridor-in-great-pyramid-of-giza\/ar-AA188rgH) \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve been eager to hear more from the Scan Pyramids project for years. Well, they finally made an announcement... But first a little context. Back in 2016 and 2017, the Scan Pyramids project used infrared thermography, ultrasound, ground-penetrating radar, cosmic-ray muon radiography, and other techniques to reveal voids within the Great Pyramid \u2014 voids which were likely unknown rooms and corridors. One of the voids was small and located behind the lower two chevron stones on the north face of the pyramid, but it was dismissed by many. Yesterday, it was announced that this \u201csmall\u201d void is in fact a 30-foot corridor, roughly 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall. And not only did they confirm this with various fancy methods, but they were able to see inside it with an endoscope as well (see image). While I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all love to think that this was a walkway to a chamber filled with artifacts, it does seem to have a dead end, and the stone is rough-hewn, so it\u2019s likely that it was used to redistribute weight, possibly for the descending passageway or some unknown space, similar to the relieving chambers above the King\u2019s Chamber. But this, in itself, is exciting, as it sheds light on the construction of the pyramid. It may even point us to another unknown feature. Mostafa Waziri said, \u201c*We're going to continue our scanning so we will see what we can do ... to figure out what we can find out beneath it, or just by the end of this corridor.*\u201d And one other exciting thing is that muon technology has now proven to be effective in the context of the pyramid. So we can be pretty certain that those other voids are legit. So what the heck are they?

It\u2019s a site that really sparked my love of the ancient world. And it continues to fascinate me, so I was really excited to hear that a new Moai statue has been discovered buried in a recently dried-up lakebed hidden by tall reeds. This has stirred up a lot of excitement about the possibility of other unknown Moai. The smaller (but still quite large) statue has not yet been excavated, but here\u2019s a short [clip](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JKdzKodQPRQ&t=29s) with more info and imagery.\n* [Steel Was Already Being Used in Europe 2,900 Years Ago, Shows Study](https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2023-02-steel-europe-years.html) \u2014 A new study tells us that steel tools were in use in Europe 2,900 years ago, long before we thought possible. According to the researchers, Bronze-Age stone stelae on the Iberian peninsula have complex engravings that could only have been done with tempered steel. They backed up their assumption with experimental trials with different metals on the stone. Furthermore, the analysis of an iron chisel from the same period, found at Rocha do Vigio, shows that it consists of carbon-rich steel. Until now, it was thought that no one in Europe produced quality steel until well into the Iron Age. And it only became widespread under the Roman Empire. According to Araque Gonzalez, \u201c*The chisel from Rocha do Vigio and the context where it was found show that iron metallurgy including the production and tempering of steel were probably indigenous developments of decentralized small communities in Iberia, and not due to the influence of later colonization processes. This also has consequences for the archaeological assessment of iron metallurgy and quartzite sculptures in other regions of the world.*\u201d\n* [Archaeologists Unearth 1,200-Year-Old Wari Temple Complex](https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2023\/02\/archaeologists-unearth-1200-year-old-wari-temple-complex\/146279) \u2014 A Wari ritual complex with a D-shaped temple, patio-group architecture, supporting buildings, and a monumental platform have been discovered at the site of Pakaytambo in Peru. The site is situated on a key prehistoric transit route. The Wari Empire was in power in the central Andes and coastal areas of Peru from 600-1000 CE.  According to David Reid, \u201c*One of the most effective ways of bringing people into the empire was through shared beliefs and religious practices. Open plaza spaces associated with the temple complex at Pakaytambo would have allowed local communities to participate in ritual gatherings organized by the Wari*.\u201d This is the first evidence of an imperial presence in the region and should shed light on how the Wari strengthened state authority through public ritual and performance.\n* [Ancient DNA Upends European Prehistory](https:\/\/www.science.org\/content\/article\/ancient-dna-upends-european-prehistory) \u2014 A new genomic study is responsible for a number of interesting finds. 1) Many of you will be familiar with the Gravettian, an archaeological industry from about 33,000 years ago that looks very much like a single culture ranging from Spain to western Russia. Well, a new study of 116 newly sequenced genomes (and hundreds of previously sequenced genomes) has found that Gravettians in France and Spain were genetically distinct from those living in the Czech Republic and Italy. According to Mateja Hajdinjak, \u201c*What we thought was one homogenous thing in Europe 30,000 years ago is actually two distinct groups.*\u201d Beyond the significance of this to our prehistoric narrative, it is significant because it shows once again that assumptions made about cultural units in archaeology aren\u2019t always accurate. 2) The study confirmed that humans, including the Gravettians, migrated to southern Europe, and in particular the Iberian Peninsula and the south of France, during the last ice age when glaciers covered much of Northern Europe (26,000 to 19,000 BP). Interestingly, though, in the Italian Peninsula, which was thought to have been another refuge, the Gravettian population completely disappeared. And after the glacial maximum, people in Italy had genetic links with the Near East, indicating that a population arrived from the Balkans. 3) The study found that 14,000 years ago, when temperatures rose sharply over a few centuries, cultural changes that were thought to be those of an existing population adapting to the changing climate and ecosystem were actually due to a near-complete population replacement. The Magdalenians nearly vanished and were replaced by populations from Italy. And 4) Despite similar lifestyles, hunter-gatherers in Western Europe 10,000 years ago were actually genetically distinct from those east of the Baltic sea, and they did not mix at all between 14,000 and 8,000 years ago, despite a lack of geographic barriers, which is very unusual. The researchers note, however, that they lack data from likely contact zones. About the study as a whole, Jennifer French said, \u201c*This genetic data shows we\u2019ve oversimplified what was going on in terms of population interaction. It provides a lot more nuance than we\u2019ve been able to with archaeological data alone*.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677938638.0},{"title":"new kids book on coastal archaeology","author":"iainmpm","url":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dig-Deep-Connecting-Archaeology-Footprints\/dp\/1459826086","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677988114.0},{"title":"Now that we have abundant evidence that humans were in the Americas before the Cordilleran ice sheet melted, do we have any idea which groups sailed to the Americas first?

It is dated to 2,000 years ago during the time of the pre-\u00d3c Eo culture, making it one of the oldest chordophones ever discovered in Southeast Asia. According to Fredeliza Campos, \u201c*It fills the gap between the region\u2019s earliest known musical instruments \u2013 lithophones or stone percussion plates \u2013 and more modern instruments.*\u201d The instrument would have been 14 inches long. It has a hole at the top, which is what got the researchers\u2019 attention since it was probably for a tuning peg. It also has a notched bridge to support the string(s). The antler was one of 600 bone artifacts that were found, and three bronze bells were unearthed as well. Here\u2019s Campos again, \u201c*The striking similarities between the artifacts we studied and some stringed instruments that are still being played suggest that traditional Vietnamese music has its origins in the prehistoric past*.\u201d The researchers believe it would have been played similarly to today\u2019s K\u2019n\u00fd. If you\u2019re not familiar with the K\u2019n\u00fd, [check this out](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KTC5QnkYysY&feature=youtu.be) \u2014 it really is worth a listen. The musician\u2019s mouth controls the sound and acts as the resonator.\n* [It\u2019s Not a Darning Tool, It\u2019s a Very Naughty Toy: Roman Dildo Found](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2023\/feb\/20\/its-not-a-darning-tool-its-a-very-naughty-toy-roman-dildo-found) \u2014 What might be the first-ever Roman dildo was misclassified as a darning tool when it was discovered in the Roman fort of Vindolanda in England back in 1992. Hm, where to begin\u2026 To say that the artifact was re-analyzed is, perhaps, a bit grandiose. A glance at it will tell you that this is no darning tool. Rob Collins can back me up here, \u201c*I have to confess, part of me thinks it\u2019s kind of self-evident that it is a penis. I don\u2019t know who entered it into the catalog. Maybe it was somebody uncomfortable with it or didn\u2019t think the Romans would do such silly things*.\u201d But we know that they did, based on artwork depicting it. Despite the headlines you\u2019ll see on the topic, it should be noted that the researchers are not sure that it was, in fact, a sex toy. One possibility that the researchers note is that it could have been used as a pestle. And this lines up with the fact that the 6+ inch phallus has ends (plural) that are worn smooth. Another possibility is that it was slotted into a statue where passersby could touch it for good luck, which was actually quite common at the time. So the \u201cdildo\u201d idea is in question and, personally, as much as I love \u201cfirst-ever\u201d finds, I\u2019d lean toward the penis-pestle idea. I made my wife a (non-penis) wooden pestle and mortar once, and it really is quite similar. Plus, someone\u2019s gotta say it\u2026 Is wood really the material you would choose for a sex toy? \ud83d\ude2c\n* [Discovery of 4,500-Year-Old Palace in Iraq May Hold Key to Ancient Civilization](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2023\/feb\/17\/discovery-of-4500-year-old-palace-in-iraq-may-hold-key-to-ancient-civilisation) \u2014 A 4,500-year-old palace and temple have been discovered in Tello, Iraq, where the ancient Sumerian city of Girsu once stood. Girsu was a major administrative center. The site, which was originally discovered in the 19th century, was thought to consist of two large mounds, but a 2021 study used remote sensing to find a large complex that has now been excavated. The palace is known as the Lord Palace of the Kings. The temple is called Eninnu, or the White Thunderbird, and it is dedicated to the Sumerian god, Nin\u011dirsu. It would have been one of the most important temples in Mesopotamia at one time, and while lost until recently, it was known from inscriptions found around the ancient city. Also found during excavations were 200+ cuneiform tablets.\n* [Archaeologists Find Homes of Europe\u2019s First Monument Builders, and They\u2019re Fortified](https:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/archaeology\/2023-02-21\/ty-article\/archaeologists-find-homes-of-europes-first-monument-builders-and-theyre-fortified\/00000186-6dc6-dc51-a197-7fce6ec20000) \u2014 It\u2019s difficult to say exactly how people lived during the transition to the Neolithic revolution, but a new discovery sheds some light on that. A 6,300-year-old settlement with two palisades and a ditch was discovered at the site of Le Peu near Charm\u00e9, France. The archaeologists responsible for the discovery believe they\u2019ve found rare traces of homes that would have belonged to the people responsible for the earliest monumental stone structures in Europe. In total, there were four wooden buildings inside the palisades and two outside. The structures were large, with areas of roughly 100 square meters, indicating that they could have housed extended family, or perhaps they were meeting places. Based on debris in the postholes, it seems that the walls were wattle-and-daub, and the roofs were thatch or bark. The researchers also found traces of a raised platform in one of the buildings, which might have been used as a kitchen or sleeping area. According to the researchers, the dating of the find debunks the idea that Europe\u2019s stone monuments emerged separately from the construction of large enclosures. Interestingly, according to Vincent Ard, \u201c*The use of stones is reserved for the world of the dead. We have no evidence of buildings made of stone here other than the Tusson necropolis.\u201d*\n* [Homo Sapiens May Have Brought Archery to Europe About 54,000 Years Ago](https:\/\/www.sciencenews.org\/article\/homo-sapiens-archery-europe-neandertal#:~:text=Homo%20sapiens%20who%20reached%20Europe,southern%20France%20called%20Grotte%20Mandrin.) \u2014 A new study suggests that Homo sapiens introduced bows and arrows to Europe on their way out of Africa 54,000 years ago. Researchers analyzed small, triangular stone points that were found at the Grotte Mandrin rock shelter in southern France. By comparing them to modern examples and testing their own points, the researchers found that the smallest points (less than a centimeter in width) could not have pierced animals\u2019 hides without being shot from bows. They also found signs of high-impact damage and wear that indicated they were attached to shafts at the bottom of the stones. The researchers suggest that Homo sapiens at that time hunted with bows and arrows as well as spears, the latter being indicated by bigger stones that were also found. For whatever reason, Neanderthals do not seem to have picked up on the use of bows and arrows. This could be because spears worked better in cold environments where strings snapped easily, or it could be because Neanderthals lacked the requisite visual and spatial abilities. Given what we now know of Neanderthals, I tend to believe it\u2019s the former.

This was an extraordinary find for a number of reasons, so buckle up. The tools are 2.9 million years old, making them the oldest Oldowan tools ever found by about 300,000 years. They\u2019re also some of the oldest-known stone tools that were used in the butchering of large animals (and the pounding of plants) \u2014 in this case, hippos. And that makes this the oldest known example of hominins eating meat (probably raw since it\u2019s from before the oldest accepted evidence of fire), changing the way experts view carnivory among hominins. That\u2019s all pretty impressive, but here\u2019s the kicker: The only hominin remains found at the site were two molars from the genus, Paranthropus. These remains are the oldest remains of our early cousins ever found. And finding them in the same place as these tools suggests that they used them \u2014 until now, it was thought that only our direct ancestors (Homo) used Oldowan tools. In fact, this technology was once considered a marker for the beginning of human modernity. So yeah, not a bad haul by those archaeologists!\n* [Rare Ancient Paycheck Of A Roman Legionary Soldier Found At Masada](https:\/\/www.ancientpages.com\/2023\/02\/16\/rare-ancient-paycheck-of-a-roman-legionary-soldier-found-at-masada\/) \u2014 A rare papyrus was discovered in Masada, Israel. It\u2019s the paycheck of a Roman legionary soldier dated to 72 CE, during the period of the Great Revolt. It\u2019s worth noting that this is a different Great Revolt from the one I covered in the [last issue](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/p\/ancient-beat-47-the-great-revolt) \u2014 this one was a revolt of the Jews against the Romans. Anywho, this is one of three paychecks ever discovered in the Roman Empire, and it includes some interesting info. It details the soldier\u2019s salary over two pay periods (there would have been three periods per year), and includes deductions for boots, a linen tunic, and barley fodder for his horse. Basic equipment would have been covered by the Empire, but apparently, these items weren\u2019t quite basic enough (who needs boots or a shirt, am I right?). The deductions almost exceeded the soldier\u2019s salary, which begs the question, \u201cWhy enlist?\u201d From a monetary perspective, apparently looting and various other side-hustles often made it worth their while.\n* [Archaeologists in Northern Mexico Shed New Light on Ancient Huastec Burial and Construction Practices](https:\/\/www.theartnewspaper.com\/2023\/02\/13\/mexico-el-naranjo-inah-excavations-archaeological-discoveries) \u2014 A series of circular mounds has been discovered at the site of El Naranjo in Mexico. Two of the mounds have been excavated, revealing a dozen burials from between 600 and 900 CE. The burials were in keeping with the Huastec cultural tradition. One of the mounds is 20 meters in diameter, and was built with limestone and basalt masonry which must have been transported a long distance. It contains the remains of three adult individuals with obsidian blades, green quartz earrings, and shell ornaments in the shape of flowers. Also found in the mounds were hearths, ceramics, grinding stones, and projectile points, all of which indicate that the mounds were used not only for burials, but for daily activities as well. The discovery sheds light on Huastec burial and construction practices.\n* [Book of Revelation Has Terminology Similar to Ancient Curse Tablets](https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2023\/02\/book-of-revelation-has-terminology-similar-to-ancient-curse-tablets\/146163) \u2014 A research project has been investigating the overlap between the tradition of curse tablets and the Bible\u2019s Book of Revelation. They\u2019ve found that the wording used in curse tablets is very similar to those of Revelation. According to Michael H\u00f6lscher, \u201c*It is possible that those who read or listened to the words of the Apocalypse of John could readily have seen whole passages, single phrases, or concepts in the light of curse spells*.\u201d\n* [500-Year-Old Horn Container Discovered in South Africa Sheds Light on Pre-Colonial Khoisan Medicines](https:\/\/theconversation.com\/500-year-old-horn-container-discovered-in-south-africa-sheds-light-on-pre-colonial-khoisan-medicines-199192?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=bylinetwitterbutton) \u2014 A couple of years ago, a 500-year-old cow horn with a leather lid was discovered in Misgund, South Africa, carefully wrapped in grass and leaves. Inside the horn was the residue of an unknown liquid. Well, according to recent chemical analysis, the horn was a medicine container \u2014 the earliest known object of its kind in southern Africa. The scientists identified several secondary plant metabolites, including mono-methyl inositol and lupeol, both of which are known to have medicinal properties, including control of blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and the treatment of fevers, inflammation, and infections. The area where it was found would have been occupied by both San hunter-gatherers and Khoi pastoralists. Interestingly, both believed in a mythical animal like a cow that had medicinal horns.\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676731288.0},{"title":"The Agresan Ali Baoli stepwell in Delhi.

Wouldn't be Saturday without some interesting ancient happenings to read about :) Here are this week's Top 5 ancient headlines:\n\n* [Changing Climate Conditions Likely Facilitated Early Human Migration to the Americas at Key Intervals, Research Suggests](https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2023\/02\/230206193957.htm) \u2014 As you may have noticed, there is a growing body of evidence saying that people came to the Americas long before an ice-free corridor opened in the ice sheets of Canada. Well, a new study of sediment cores identified two intervals that would have supported early human migration to North America, thanks to favorable ice and ocean conditions. The sediment cores showed that during the periods of 22,000-24,500 BP and 14,800-16,400 BP, sea ice was present in the winter, which may have given people a chance to travel along the coast. According to Summer Praetorius, \u201c*Sea ice is relatively flat and pretty stable when it is stuck to the shoreline, so you can walk on the ice and hunt seals to survive through the winter. It seems possible that sea ice could have facilitated movement, rather than hinder it, by providing a more traversable surface than the hazardous pathway of crevassed glaciers or paddling against strong ocean currents.*\u201d These findings back the existing (and growing) theory that people followed a Pacific coastal route as they headed south. And it\u2019s worth noting that meltwater from the Cordilleran ice sheet would have accelerated ocean currents moving north, making boat travel difficult, which is why they believe these people made the trip by foot. \n* [Evidence Oldest Bone Spear Point in the Americas is 13,900 Years Old](https:\/\/www.ancientpages.com\/2023\/02\/03\/evidence-oldest-bone-spear-point-in-the-americas-is-13900-years-old\/) \u2014 A new study has found the oldest bone spear point in the Americas, and it\u2019s 13,900 years old. That\u2019s 900 years older than the famous Clovis points. According to Michael Walters, \u201c*We isolated the bone fragments, printed them out and assembled them. This clearly showed this was the tip of a bone projectile point. This is the oldest bone projectile point in the Americas and represents the oldest direct evidence of mastodon hunting in the Americas.*\u201d The spear point was embedded in a mastodon rib at the site of Manis in Washington state, US. It was made from the leg bone of a mastodon.\n* [Researcher Using AI to Piece Together Fragments of Ancient Texts](https:\/\/www.jpost.com\/archaeology\/article-730612) \u2014 I\u2019ll be honest, I question the application of artificial intelligence in so many aspects of our lives, but I\u2019m pretty excited about this one. A team created a database of thousands of photographed fragments of Babylonian tablets, and they developed an algorithm designed to piece together fragments of these texts. They call it the \u201cFragmentarium\u201d. There are many such fragments, and they\u2019re written in two complex writing systems \u2014 Sumerian and Akkadian \u2014 so it\u2019s a big task to say the least. To date, hundreds of manuscripts have been pieced together by the program, including a tablet telling the Epic of Gilgamesh and a hymn to the city of Babylon. According to Enrique Jim\u00e9nez, \u201c*Hitherto there have been no hymns to cities in Babylonian literature. Now we have found 15 new fragments of it. Without the Fragmentarium, the reconstruction would have taken 30 or 40 years.*\u201d The Fragmentarium will soon be available to the public. Who\u2019s ready to geek out on that? \ud83e\udd13  \n* [New Research Suggests Drought Accelerated Empire Collapse](https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2023\/02\/230208124227.htm) \u2014 The Hittite Empire of central Anatolia was a major power in the ancient world for five centuries until roughly 1200 BCE, when their capital city of Hattusa was abandoned and the empire fell for unknown reasons. Theories have ranged from war to internal strife, but a new dendrochronological study of Juniper wood found at the Midas Mound Tumulus at the site of Gordion in Turkey is painting a different picture. Tree ring growth showed unusually narrow rings indicating dry conditions from the late 13th century to the 12th century BCE., with a severe drought between 1198 and 1196 BCE, give or take three years. This was confirmed by the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 isotopes in the rings. This extreme three-year drought would have caused famine in the Hittite empire. The tax base would have been affected, the army weakened, and migration would have been necessary. While the drought may not have been the only factor in the demise of the Hittites, it was almost certainly a significant one. This study is not unlike the one I covered recently in issue [\\#44](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/p\/ancient-beat-44-a-new-silk-road-kissing) which showed how dry and wet periods affected Persian empires. I think we can all agree that droughts are bad news for empires.\n* [Battle Site of 'Great Revolt' Recorded on Rosetta Stone Unearthed in Egypt](https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/rosetta-stone-ancient-egyptian-battle-site) \u2014 Historical decrees and texts, including the Rosetta Stone, mention an Egyptian rebellion against Ptolemaic rule known as the Great Revolt, which occurred between 207 and 184 CE. Well, archaeologists have now discovered the location of one of its battles. Evidence of violent conflict was found during the excavation of the site of Tell el-Timai in Egypt, which was once a Greco-Roman city called Thmouis. The evidence included burnt buildings, ballista stones, and unburied human remains \u2014 the latter being unusual since ancient Egyptians took such great care with their burials. Until recently, they weren\u2019t sure which conflict they were excavating, but by using coins and other artifacts like pottery sherds, they were able to conclusively say that its date coincides with that of the Great Revolt. According to Jay Silverstein, \u201c*We have opened a new door into our understanding of Hellenistic colonialism, indigenous resistance, and the mechanisms of control including the brutality of the Macedonian dynasty\u2019s rule of Egypt*.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676131890.0},{"title":"Prehistoric world heritage site Gobekli Tepe survives Turkey earthquakes","author":"Al-Monitor","url":"https:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/originals\/2023\/02\/prehistoric-world-heritage-site-gobekli-tepe-survives-turkey-earthquakes","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676061455.0},{"title":"Spices still had \u2018distinctive aroma\u2019 after being discovered on 15th century shipwreck off coast of Sweden","author":"franks-and-beans","url":"https:\/\/www.kansascity.com\/news\/nation-world\/world\/article272338058.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676039178.0},{"title":"Severe multi-year drought coincident with Hittite collapse around 1198\u20131196 BC","author":"Rear-gunner","url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41586-022-05693-y","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1676024716.0},{"title":"Florida Archeologists unearth 7,000 year old artifacts, human remains at Miami construction site","author":"justin_quinnn","url":"https:\/\/canadatoday.news\/ca\/miami-officials-will-consider-saving-the-7000-year-old-brickell-archeological-site-261928\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675989744.0},{"title":"Do the PCA offer part time contracts for Trainee Field Archaeologists?","author":"Objective-Grape4382","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/10z4gia\/do_the_pca_offer_part_time_contracts_for_trainee\/","text":"Hi I'd like to thank everyone for their advice on my last post about looking for work near London, it's helped so much.\n\nI've started sending emails off and applying and I'm planning to contact PCA.

For starters, a large trade network would have been necessary to obtain these substances (tars, fats, tree resins, and oils), which were probably sourced from the Mediterranean, other parts of Africa, and possibly even Asia. The most surprising substance found was dammar resin, which would have come all the way from India and Southeast Asia, but the researchers note that they\u2019re uncertain about its presence. Regardless, they went as far as to say that embalming would have been a driving force for globalization at the time. And there\u2019s more. Discussing the antifungal and antibacterial properties of some of the substances, Mahmoud Bahgat said, \u201c*This is really the fascinating part of it\u2026 If Egyptians went that far to get these particular natural products, from these particular countries and not other countries in between, it means they meant it, it was not just done as a trial and error\u2026 They knew about microbiology.*\u201d And lastly, the site\u2019s 100+ vessels, many of which were labeled, corrected misconceptions about certain substances that were mentioned in Egyptian texts. Not a bad haul!\n* [Pit Find in Germany Reveals How Neanderthals Hunted Huge Elephants](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2023\/feb\/01\/pit-find-in-germany-reveals-how-neanderthals-hunted-huge-elephants) \u2014 According to a new study, Neanderthals may have lived in larger groups than we originally thought. Researchers examined the 125,000-year-old remains of straight-tusked elephants that were found near the city of Halle, Germany in the 1980s. These elephants were bigger than mammoths and a whopping 3x the size of modern Asian elephants. So, ya know\u2026 pretty big. Most of the elephants found were adult males, which were bigger and easier\\*\\* to hunt since they were more solitary than females, and according to the study, this indicates that they were probably hunted as opposed to scavenged. Wil Roebroeks asserts, \u201c*This constitutes the first clearcut evidence of elephant-hunting in human evolution*.\u201d An average 10-ton elephant would have provided 2,500 daily portions for an adult Neanderthal. And according to Roebroeks, \u201c\u2026*if you have a 10-ton elephant and you want to process that animal before it becomes rotten, you need something like 20 people to finish it in a week*.\u201d Sure, they may have let some of the meat go to waste, but then why not go after smaller prey? It\u2019s likely that they either preserved it, which is something we didn\u2019t know they could do, or they had much larger groups than we thought. Or both. And it\u2019s worth noting that traces of charcoal were also found, which could indicate that they were drying their meat.\n* [\u2018Incredible\u2019 Roman Bathers\u2019 Gems Lost 2,000 Years Ago Found Near Hadrian\u2019s Wall](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk-news\/2023\/jan\/28\/roman-bathers-gems-carved-stones-archaeologists-hadrians-wall) \u2014 Thirty semi-precious stones were discovered in the drain of a Roman bathhouse near Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Carlisle, England. The find dates to the 2nd or 3rd century CE. The stones are thought to have fallen off of rings after the baths weakened the vegetable glue that held them in place. Although small, the gems are engraved and would have been quite expensive. Examples include an amethyst depicting Venus with a flower or mirror, a jasper with a satyr on rocks near a sacred column, Mars holding a spear, and a mouse eating a branch (mice symbolized rebirth and fertility). A ring, 40 hairpins, 35 glass beads, and a necklace were also found.\n* [Large Number of Skulls Discovered in Cueva Des Cubierta, a Neanderthal Cave in Spain](https:\/\/nowarchaeology.com\/large-number-of-skulls-discovered-in-cueva-des-cubierta-a-neanderthal-cave-in-spain\/) \u2014 Numerous 40,000-year-old animal skulls were discovered in Cuevas Des Cubierta in Spain, a site once frequented by Neanderthals for ritual purposes. The skulls belonged to large herbivores like aurochs, bison, deer, and rhinoceroses,  and all had either horns or antlers. Given that the skulls were heavy and wouldn\u2019t have yielded much food, the researchers believe they may have been trophies. I would lean more toward the \u201critual purpose\u201d side of things, but that\u2019s just me. It\u2019s worth noting that deliberate care was taken with the skulls, which had been processed using tools and sometimes fire.\n* [Mysterious Medieval City in Africa Had a Genius System to Survive Drought](https:\/\/www.sciencealert.com\/mysterious-medieval-city-in-africa-had-a-genius-system-to-survive-drought) \u2014 Great Zimbabwe, the first major city in southern Africa, reached its peak between the 11th and 15th centuries CE and had roughly 18,000 inhabitants. No one knows why it is now in ruins. The leading explanation was drought, but researchers have now found evidence of careful water conservation. They believe that the series of \u201cdhaka pits\u201d (circular depressions) outside the city were actually used for capturing water; not for digging up clay, as was originally believed. The pits are located strategically to capture rain and groundwater at the bases of hills, straddling streams, and so forth. If their calculations are right, these pits may have held over 18 million liters of water \u2014 enough for the inhabitants to stay hydrated all year round. Plants found in the pits also corroborate that there was a good deal of water.\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675526176.0},{"title":"Dating of a large tool assemblage at the Cooper\u2019s Ferry site (Idaho, USA) to ~15,785 cal yr B.P. extends the age of stemmed points in the Americas","author":"stankmanly","url":"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/sciadv.ade1248","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1675522321.0},{"title":"Cuneiform Tablets Recently Translated by AI!

The evidence of selection to remove Neanderthal DNA from chromosome X was a tell-tale sign that male hybrids had reduced fertility.   \n>  \n>The problems faced by modern humans with Neanderthal ancestry went beyond reduced fertility, as it turns out that Neanderthal ancestry is not just reduced on the X chromosome and around genes important in male reproduction, but is also reduced around the great majority of genes (there is far more Neanderthal ancestry in \"junk\" parts of the genome with few biological functions). The clearest evidence for this came from a study in 2016, in which we published a genome-wide ancient DNA dataset from more than fifty Eurasians spread over the last forty-five thousand years.\\* We showed that Neanderthal ancestry decreased continually from 3 to 6 percent in most of the samples we analyzed from earlier times to its present-day value of around 2 percent at later times and that this was driven by widespread natural selection against Neanderthal DNA.","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1675229323.0},{"title":"Interesting Finds Unearthed in Spain Show That Some Neanderthals Accumulated Animal Skulls","author":"sheizdza","url":"https:\/\/ulukayin.org\/spain-neanderthals-animal-skulls\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675114187.0},{"title":"Urartian King Argishti's shield reveals the name of an unknown country","author":"hassusas","url":"https:\/\/arkeonews.net\/urartian-king-argishtis-shield-reveals-the-name-of-an-unknown-country\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675096311.0},{"title":"Anglo-Saxon monasteries were more resilient to Viking attacks than previously thought, archaeologists at the University of Reading have concluded.","author":"uniofreading","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/10p1eis\/anglosaxon_monasteries_were_more_resilient_to\/","text":"Lyminge, a monastery in Kent, was on the front line of long-running Viking hostility which ended in the victories of Alfred the Great.

Here are this week's Top 5 ancient headlines:\n\n* [Violence Was Widespread in Early Farming Society](https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2023\/01\/230119112803.htm) \u2014 Researchers studied the remains of 2,300 early farmers that were found at 180 sites in Northwest Europe ranging from 8,000-4,000 years ago, and found that more than 10% displayed weapon injuries. This may have been a peak not only in violence, but in the destruction of communities, as indicated by mass burials. According to Martin Smith, \u201c*The study raises the question to why violence seems to have been so prevalent during this period. The most plausible explanation may be that the economic base of society had changed. With farming came inequality and those who fared less successfully appear at times to have engaged in raiding and collective violence as an alternative strategy for success, with the results now increasingly being recognized archaeologically.*\u201d That last bit about recognizing it is because strides have been made recently in distinguishing between fatal injuries and post-mortem breakage, as well as between accidental and violent deaths. According to the researchers, the agrarian way of life even paved the way for formalized warfare.\n* [More Than 1,000 Prehistoric Burial Mounds Discovered in the Netherlands](https:\/\/www.ancientpages.com\/2023\/01\/26\/more-than-1000-ancient-prehistoric-mounds-discovered-in-the-netherlands\/) \u2014 Heritage Quest is a collaboration between archaeologists and the citizens of Veluwe and Utrechtse Heuvelrug in the Netherlands. Over 6,500 people participated by searching the landscape for archaeological objects. The result? Thousands of potential archaeological points of interest were found, including burial mounds from 3,800-500 BCE, Celtic field complexes from 1,100-200 BCE, charcoal kilns, and cart tracks. So far, they\u2019ve sampled soil from 300 of the proposed mounds and 80 of them are the real deal. Apparently, the organization believes chances are high that 1,250 of the proposed mounds will turn out to be legitimate. Quentin Bourgeois said, \u201c*Having so many volunteers participate has produced an unprecedented amount of new data and radically changed our view of prehistory. The Veluwe and Utrechtse Heuvelrug prove to have been much more intensively inhabited than we thought*.\u201d\n* [Mirror and sword discovered in a 4th-century Japanese tomb](https:\/\/nowarchaeology.com\/mirror-and-sword-discovered-in-a-4th-century-japanese-tomb\/) \u2014 A 2.37-meter-long iron sword and a bronze mirror shaped like a shield were discovered at Tomio Maruyama, the largest circular Kofun burial mound in Japan, with a 109-meter diameter and dating to the 4th century CE. The mound is thought to belong to a powerful supporter of the Yomato rule, and the grave where the sword and mirror were found is thought to be that of someone close to this person. The sword is apparently the largest intact sword ever found in Japan, and due to its size, experts believe the sword was a ceremonial object rather than a weapon. The mirror has the largest surface area of any bronze mirror found in Japan, and its shape is unique, though two spherical designs on the back of the mirror are the same as those found on a type of mirror called a \u201cdaryukyo\u201d. Both artifacts were found in the clay that covered a wooden coffin which, according to one source, was 5 meters long. I\u2019ll note that this size is surprising, and I only saw it mentioned in one article \u2014 others don\u2019t mention the coffin\u2019s size. The contents of the coffin are set to be examined next. According to Kosaku Okabayashi, \u201c*\\[These discoveries\\] indicate that the technology of the Kofun period (300-710) are beyond what had been imagined, and they are masterpieces in metalwork from that period*.\u201d\n* [1.2-Million-Year-Old Obsidian Axe Factory Found in Ethiopia](https:\/\/www.iflscience.com\/1-2-million-year-old-obsidian-axe-factory-found-in-ethiopia-67232) \u2014 At the Melka Kunture site of Ethiopia, archaeologists have discovered a layer of sediment containing 578 stone tools, most of which are obsidian. This layer of the site, which was identified as an obsidian handaxe workshop, dates to 1.2 million years ago. According to the researchers, it is the only such workshop from the Early Pleistocene ever discovered \u2014 until now, the earliest was from the second half of the Middle Pleistocene in Europe. Apparently, \u201c*the morphological standardization is remarkable*,\u201d and whoever created the artifacts clearly cared a lot about the regularization of the tools \u2014 something that is quite difficult with a delicate stone like obsidian. According to the researchers, these artisans, \u201c*creatively solved through convergent thinking technological problems such as effectively detaching and shaping large flakes of the unusually brittle and cutting volcanic glass*.\u201d It is not known which species is responsible for the handiwork.\n* [Agriculture Linked to Changes in Age-Independent Mortality in North America](https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2023\/01\/230123123300.htm) \u2014 And let\u2019s circle back to agriculture and warfare, with another recent study. Researchers analyzed archaeobotanical data from eight states in North America looking for increases in consumption of domesticated crops over foraged food. And they cross-referenced that data with skeletal data, looking to identify increases in age-independent mortality (death between 5 and 19 years of age when people are less likely to die). They found that there were two stages of crop domestication in pre-colonial North America. A decrease in age-independent mortality happened during the first stage (0-500 CE) when plants like squash and sunflowers were domesticated. Apparently, this was a time when indigenous societies flourished. But an increase in age-independent mortality occurred during the second stage (700-1000 CE) when maize and beans were cultivated. During this time, cultural shifts occurred, including the development of powerful chiefdom societies, more crowded living conditions (which may have increased disease), and increased warfare. Their findings parallel what is seen across the world with the advent of agriculture.\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1674921557.0},{"title":"Ancient statue of Hercules emerges from Rome sewer repairs | Italy","author":"sktafe2020","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2023\/jan\/27\/ancient-statue-of-hercules-emerges-from-rome-sewerage-repairs","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674873316.0},{"title":"The Museum Built on Native American Burial Mounds","author":"mhfc","url":"https:\/\/www.propublica.org\/article\/repatriation-nagpra-museums-dickson-mounds-museum","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674853473.0},{"title":"Archaeologists discovered dozens of headless bodies in a 7,000-year-old mass grave","author":"literanista","url":"https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/news\/world\/archaeologists-found-38-skeletons-in-a-7000-year-old-mass-grave-all-but-one-had-been-decapitated\/ar-AA16DMw3","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1674825366.0},{"title":"Researchers in Cairo Used CT Scans to 'Digitally Unwrap' a 2,300-Year-Old Mummy of a Teenager, Discovering 49 Gold Amulets","author":"mhfc","url":"https:\/\/news.artnet.com\/art-world\/golden-boy-mummy-digitally-unwrapped-cairo-2247747","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1674827768.0},{"title":"Tribunal or restitution?

Happy Saturday :) Here are this week's Top 5 ancient headlines:\n\n* [World\u2019s Oldest Rune Stone Found in Norway, Archaeologists Believe](https:\/\/sciencenorway.no\/archaeology-language-runes\/worlds-oldest-rune-stone-found-in-norway-archaeologists-believe\/2141404) \u2014 A rune stone was found in a grave in Hole municipality, Norway. Materials found alongside it have dated it to between 0 and 250 CE,  making it the oldest rune stone, and even the oldest example of written words, in Scandinavia. Until now, a spearhead and comb were the earliest. It appears to have been carved with a knife or needle. Eight of the runes on the front face seem to spell out the name of a woman. According to Kristel Zelmers, \u201c*The text possibly refers to a woman called Idibera and the inscription could mean 'For Idibera'.*\u201d It could also be other variations of the name or even a kin name. Perhaps it is the name of the person in the grave. The article goes further into the fascinating origin of runes if you\u2019d like to dig deeper.\n* [Study May Have Solved the Mystery of the Nazca Lines](https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2023\/01\/study-solves-mystery-of-the-nazca-lines\/145948) \u2014 The same team that recently discovered 168 new geoglyphs in the Nazca Desert of Peru (see issue [\\#39](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/p\/ancient-beat-39-seafaring-hominins)) believe the Nazca Lines to be an ancient form of communication. In short, linear geoglyphs would have been used to travel from one valley to another, while animal geoglyphs, which are generally positioned on slopes near ancient pathways, marked routes that were used for communication between settlements. Nothing conclusive, but interesting nonetheless.\n* [Has An Unknown Ancient \u2018Israel Silk Road\u2019 Been Discovered?](https:\/\/www.ancientpages.com\/2023\/01\/20\/has-an-unknown-ancient-israel-silk-road-been-discovered\/) \u2014 Cotton and silk fabrics were discovered in the Arabah on the border of Israel and Jordan, dating to 1,300 years ago. The fabrics most likely originated in India or China. According to Guy Bar-Oz, \u201c*Our findings are apparently the first evidence that there was also an \u2018Israeli Silk Road\u2019 that passed through the Negev and the Arabah and is a new link that was not known until today in the international trade routes that connected East and West, between Asia and Europe from the main Silk Road*.\u201d He went on to say, \u201c*This road, which diverged from the traditional road, passed from the north of Israel along the route of the Spice Route, crossed the steppe and connected to the roads that crossed the Land of Israel along its length as well as to the Mediterranean ports*.\u201d This discovery has a big impact on our knowledge of the flow of \u201c*goods, people, technologies, and ideas*.\u201d\n* [Marriage Rules in Minoan Crete Revealed by Ancient DNA Analysis](https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2023-01-marriage-minoan-crete-revealed-ancient.html) \u2014 A new study found that marriage partners in Bronze-Age Minoan Crete and Mycenaean Greece were determined by kinship. The researchers were able to genetically reconstruct an ancient family tree for the first time in the Mediterranean region, as prior attempts failed due to the region\u2019s climate causing poor preservation. They found that the sons still lived in their parents\u2019 hamlet when they grew up, and their children, along with one wife\u2019s sister\u2019s child, were buried together under the courtyard of the estate. This indicates that family ties were strong and people stuck around. They also found that it was common to marry a first cousin. According to Eirini Skourtanioti, \u201c*More than a thousand ancient genomes from different regions of the world have now been published, but it seems that such a strict system of kin marriage did not exist anywhere else in the ancient world. This came as a complete surprise to all of us and raises many questions.*\" The researchers speculate that the reason for such marriages might have been to prevent inherited farmland from being divided.\n* [Archaeologists Shed Light on the Lives of Stone Age Hunter-Gatherers in Britain](https:\/\/www.ancientpages.com\/2023\/01\/20\/archaeologists-shed-light-on-the-lives-of-stone-age-hunter-gatherers-in-britain\/) \u2014 Excavations in North Yorkshire, England uncovered a small hunter-gatherer settlement from 10,500 years ago. Animal remains (elk, red deer, beavers, birds, etc.), traces of woodworking, and tools and weapons made of bone, antler, and stone were found. Some of the tools were decorated and taken apart before being deposited on what was once the shore of an island on a lake. Animal remains were also deposited in such a fashion and the researchers believe that these people had strict rules about how to handle the remains of animals, as well as the objects used to kill them. According to Nick Overton, \u201c*The Mesolithic in Britain was before the introduction of pottery or metals, so finding organic remains like bone, antler and wood, which are usually not preserved, are incredibly important in helping us to reconstruct people\u2019s lives.*\u201d And according to Amy Gray Jones, \u201c*People often think of prehistoric hunter-gatherers as living on the edge of starvation, moving from place to place in an endless search for food, and that it was only with the introduction of farming that humans lived a more settled and stable lifestyle. But here we have people inhabiting a rich network of sites and habitats, taking the time to decorate objects, and taking care over the ways they disposed of animal remains and important artifacts. These aren\u2019t people that were struggling to survive. They were people confident in their understanding of this landscape, and of the behaviors and habitats of different animal species that lived there.*\u201d They also found these people were managing and manipulating wild plants.'\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1674318426.0},{"title":"Mesoamerican Archaeology Phd Programs?","author":"anissanelita","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/10ia6oa\/mesoamerican_archaeology_phd_programs\/","text":"I\u2019m currently a junior anthropology undergrad student and have really found my passion in Mesoamerican archaeology, specifically Maya studies.

He refers to the \"area of Hurrian political power\" as coinciding with \"the distribution of a distinct ceramic type - Habur Ware.\"  That sentence is immediately followed by a reference to the \"territory of the Mitanni\" - within which and \"confined to the palaces of the aristocracy, there appeared THIS table ware, which INCLUDED dark wares undecorated, impressed and white painted, none of which had a convincing origin.\"  \n\n\nAt first reading it appears that \"THIS table ware\" refers to the previously mentioned \"Habur Ware.\"  But this is in the context of Ghirshman's Hypothesis that the particular ceramic ware of the Mitanni was something distinct from the broader (Hurrian) population of which they had become a ruling class.

Here are this week's Top 5 ancient headlines:\n\n* [Ancient Maya Structures Were Aligned to a Mysterious 260-Day Calendar](https:\/\/www.iflscience.com\/ancient-maya-structures-were-aligned-to-a-mysterious-260-day-calendar-66971) \u2014 Researchers used LiDAR to look at the astronomical orientations of 415 Olmec and Maya ceremonial structures in Mesoamerica from between 1100 BCE and 250 CE. They found that many of the structures were oriented with the solstices, quarter days, or lunar cycles of a 260-day calendar. In short, they are positioned in a way that corresponds with the sunrises on February 11 and October 29, which are 260 days apart. It was previously thought that this type of calendar went back only as far as 300 BCE, so this study suggests that the Maya understood the stars much earlier than previously thought. No one is quite sure why they used 260 days, but the researchers favor theories involving some kind of numerological significance, or the scheduling of rituals.\n* [We Finally Know How Ancient Roman Concrete Was So Durable](https:\/\/www.sciencealert.com\/we-finally-know-how-ancient-roman-concrete-was-so-durable) \u2014 Roman \u201cpozzolanic\u201d concrete was incredibly durable. The Pantheon holds the record for the world\u2019s largest dome of unreinforced concrete, and it is still intact, 2,000 years later. Part of its strength comes from mixing volcanic ash with lime, but it turns out that it also has to do with *how* it was mixed \u2014 something we didn\u2019t know until now. Researchers looked at small, white chunks of lime which were originally thought to be caused by poor mixing of materials, despite the rest being very well-mixed, and found that they were not caused by carelessness. The Romans created quicklime, then used a process called \u201chot mixing\u201d to combine it with the ash and water, and this process created those chunks. The process is also responsible for compounds that wouldn\u2019t have otherwise formed, and accelerated reactions that reduced curing and setting times for faster construction. And here\u2019s the kicker: Those chunks, or \u201clime clasts\u201d, give the concrete the ability to self-heal. When a crack forms, it goes to the chunks because they have higher surface area than other particles. And when water then goes into the crack, it reacts with the chunk to create a solution that hardens and essentially glues the crack back together. The team plans to sell it now as a more environmentally-friendly concrete.\n* [Study Investigates Source of Amazon\u2019s \u201cDark Earth\u201d](https:\/\/www.archaeology.org\/news\/11110-230106-amazon-dark-earth) \u2014 The Amazon\u2019s soil is generally quite poor in nutrients, but there is a soil found near archaeological sites that is incredibly fertile. It\u2019s known as \u201cTerra Preta\u201d or \u201cDark Earth\". Whether it was made intentionally, or as a byproduct of habitation, or due to geologic processes has been a mystery, but a new study suggests that it was created intentionally thousands of years ago. Apparently, the Kuikuro people of Brazil intentionally create their own enriched soil known as \u201ceegepe\u201d by using ash, food scraps, and controlled burns. The researchers compared Dark Earth from around the Kuikuro villages with that of other archaeological sites and found that they had \u201c*striking similarities*\u201d. Both are less acidic than surrounding soils, with higher levels of nutrients. According to Taylor Perron, \u201c*People in the ancient past figured out a way to store lots of carbon for hundreds or even thousands of years.*\u201d\n* [Mass Production of Stone Bladelets Shows Cultural Shift in Levantine Paleolithic ](https:\/\/portal.uni-koeln.de\/en\/universitaet\/aktuell\/press-releases\/single-news\/mass-production-of-stone-bladelets-shows-cultural-shift-in-levantine-paleolithic)\u2014 A new study showed that stone bladelets found at the Al-Ansab 1 archaeological site in Jordan were mass-produced on-site. The bladelets are attributed to the Ahmarian culture of the Near East (40,000-45,000 BP). The study suggests that el-Wad points, which are typical of this culture, probably resulted from attempts to reshape bigger, asymmetrical bladelets to match the quality of their unmodified bladelets, which are smaller, elongated, and symmetrical. According to the authors, the southern Ahmarian had already undergone a shift to the preferred use of small bladelets for spear and arrow tips 40,000 years ago \u2014 something which was unclear until now. The shift to bladelets allowed for long-range hunting. Even more importantly, since they were standardized and disposable, they allowed humans to cover great distances in unknown areas without having to find big, high-quality raw material. This was key in the success of Homo sapiens during the Upper Paleolithic, and for our spread throughout Europe.\n* [Why Did Ancient Humans Have Same Sense Of Smell, But Different Sensitivities?](https:\/\/www.ancientpages.com\/2023\/01\/06\/why-did-ancient-humans-have-same-sense-of-smell-but-different-sensitivities\/) \u2014 Researchers developed a new technique that allows them to test the smell sensitivity on odor receptors grown in a lab, and they\u2019ve started testing the scent perception of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans. How do people come up with this stuff? Crazy. According to Claire de March, \u201c*We had the odorant receptor genomes from Neanderthal and Denisovan individuals and we could compare them with today's humans and determine if they resulted in a different protein.*\u201d So they tested the response of the receptors to fragrances and found that Denisovans were less sensitive to odors that we perceive as floral, but much more sensitive to sulfur, balsamic, and honey \u2014 the latter being an essential high-calorie food that they may have eaten. Neanderthals were much less responsive to green, floral, and spicy scents, but they otherwise have very similar receptors to us. Olfactory receptors evolve primarily to aid in finding food, so further analysis may tell us more about ancient diets.\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1673712133.0},{"title":"Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor New Discovery","author":"wmdolls","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/10agavc","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673570941.0},{"title":"Archaeologists uncover collection of Jewish silver ornaments buried in Poland during WW2.","author":"avicfir","url":"https:\/\/www.charlotteobserver.com\/news\/nation-world\/world\/article271098227.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673565507.0},{"title":"Archaeologists believe they found the temple of Poseidon in Greece","author":"alllie","url":"https:\/\/www.jpost.com\/archaeology\/article-728358","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673535015.0},{"title":"Headless skeletons in a settlement trench in Slovakia: A 7,000-year-old mass grave?","author":"avicfir","url":"https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2023-01-headless-skeletons-settlement-trench-year-old.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673567075.0},{"title":"Look at the face of the 'Jericho Skull,' buried 9,000 years ago with shells for eyes","author":"Rear-gunner","url":"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/jericho-skull-facial-approximation","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1673511655.0},{"title":"Ostrich eggs estimated to be at least 4,000 years old have been found in Israel providing insight into the life of ancient peoples in the region.

Alongside images of aurochs, reindeer, fish, bison, and other animals in caves like Lascaux and Altamira are strange dots, lines, and other marks. At least 600 such images have been documented across Europe. According to the researchers, the number of marks acted as a record of which lunar month an animal mated in. And a \u201cY\u201d sign meant \u201cbirth\u201d. If correct, this pushes back this type of record system by more than 10,000 years. According to Paul Pettitt, \u201c*The results show that ice age hunter-gatherers were the first to use a systemic calendar and marks to record information about major ecological events within that calendar.*\u201d I love this for so many reasons, not the least of which is that an amateur discovered it, then worked alongside academics.\n* [Siberian Gravediggers Find 2,000 Year Old Scythian-Style Cemetery](https:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/archaeology\/2023-01-01\/ty-article\/siberian-gravediggers-find-2-000-year-old-scythian-style-cemetery\/00000185-6d65-d591-a1fd-fd6d40ce0000) \u2014 A cemetery of a previously unknown culture was located in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia while workers were bulldozing land to extend a modern cemetery. The original discovery of the cemetery was made a few years back, but recent analysis of the mound and grave goods made it clear that they belonged to an unknown culture. The mound in question contains an estimated 50 bodies. The bodies were placed in a large rectangular pit which was walled and roofed with timber and carpeted with birch bark. The tomb was then likely burned, though ten other burial pits found around it were not. Grave goods included bronze plaques, miniature daggers and battle axes, knives, mirrors, needles, and ceramic vessels. It is being referred to as a \u201cScythian-type\u201d burial \u2014 a fairly normal categorization since \u201cScythian\u201d refers to certain archaeological features rather than one singular people. The culture was probably a transitional Tesinian culture dating to the 2nd or 1st century BCE.\n* [Ancient DNA Paints a New Picture of the Viking Age](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/ancient-dna-paints-a-new-picture-of-the-viking-age-11672933852) \u2014 Researchers looked at ancient DNA and found that between 750 and 1099 CE, a surge of people from the British-Irish isles and the Baltic region went to Scandinavia, introducing new genetics into the Viking gene pool. According to Neil Price, \u201c*We used to speak of a \u2018Viking expansion,\u2019 in which the ancient Scandinavians somehow pushed out into the wider world in search of portable wealth, trading contacts, and lands to settle\u2026 \\[but\\] this was a world of movement in all directions\u2014into Scandinavia as well as out of it.*\u201d The newcomers were primarily female, and may have been captives taken by the Vikings. Christian missionaries, diplomats, and traders could have also been a part of the migration. Traces of these genetics today are less than expected, indicating that these people did not thrive.\n* [50,000-Year-Old Stone Tools Were Made by Monkeys](https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2022\/12\/50000-year-old-stone-tools-were-made-by-monkeys\/145671) \u2014 Stone tools from Pedra Furada in Brazil that date to 50,000 years ago probably belong to capuchin monkeys, not ancient humans, according to a recent study. The researchers compared stone tools from archaeological sites in Brazil with modern capuchin-made tools and found that they are consistent with tools used by capuchins today, which are created by repeated impacts between a boulder and flat quartzite surface. I assume the date was originally contested since humans aren\u2019t supposed to have been in South America 50,000 years ago, so this find likely adds much-needed clarity.\n* [Additional Mummies Uncovered Near Vizier\u2019s Tomb in Luxor](https:\/\/www.archaeology.org\/news\/11103-221230-egypt-luxor-tombs) \u2014 Two tombs containing nearly 60 mummies were discovered in Luxor, Egypt. The remains are those of officials and clergy. The tombs are connected to Amenhotep-Huy\u2019s tomb, who served as vizier in the 18 Dynasty during the reign of Amenhotep III (1390-1352 BCE). The vizier opposed the religious practices of the pharaoh\u2019s son, the famous Akhenaten. The tombs are dated to after this time, meaning that the vizier\u2019s tomb became a necropolis. According to Francisco Martin, \u201c*They began to build other tombs from different dynasties within the vizier\u2019s tomb, since the place was sacred.*\u201d\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1673106726.0},{"title":"2023 Field School Opportunity in Wisconsin","author":"RoughDiamond581","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/1068o1g\/2023_field_school_opportunity_in_wisconsin\/","text":"&#x200B;\n\n[I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee and we are hosting a field school during the summer of 2023.

These include claiming that Jesus was a Palestinian (he was a Jew born in Judea, around 250 years before it was renamed Palestine), and only a few days ago the Palestinian minister of Culture called the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site,  a Muslim holy place and Netanyahu's visit there as a \" Jewish storming\" of this site.

And it\u2019s not just their age that is important, but also their similarity to projectile points found in Hokkaido, Japan from 16,000-20,000 years ago. This may provide more information regarding the possible connection between ice age peoples of Northeast Asia and those of North America. The points are slender with two distinct ends and were likely attached to darts, not arrows or spears. \n* [Strange Circular Structure Unearthed in Turkey Could Be a Long-Lost Ancient City](https:\/\/curiosmos.com\/strange-circular-structure-unearthed-in-turkey-could-be-a-long-lost-ancient-city\/) \u2014 A circular structure from the Hittite era is being excavated at the site of U\u015fakl\u0131 H\u00f6y\u00fck in Turkey, and some believe it may have been a temple in the lost city of the Hittites (1650-1190 BCE) known as Zippalanda. I know, it sounds like something out of Dr. Seuss, but it\u2019s actually one of the ancient Hattic cult centers \u2014 tablets have been recovered that mention the city, its customs, and a temple to their storm god, Ziplantil. According to Anacleto D\u2019Agostino, \u201c*The structure, together with the other finds discovered over the years, would help to strengthen the identification of U\u015fakl\u0131 with the important Hittite city of Zippalanda, the cult centre of a powerful Storm God, a royal residence, and mentioned in several festivals in which the king took part*.\u201d\n* [Humans Have Been Wearing Bear Skins for At Least 300,000 Years](https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2022\/12\/humans-have-been-wearing-bear-skins-for-at-least-300000-years\/145635) \u2014 Cut marks were found on the metatarsal and phalanx of a 300,000-year-old cave bear found at the Sch\u00f6ningen archaeological site in Germany. This is an area of the body with little meat, so the researchers believe the marks are indicative of skinning rather than retrieving meat. This is one of the few examples of bear skinning from the Lower Paleolithic, making this a significant find. According to Nicholas Conard, \u201c*The use of bear skins is likely a key adaptation of early humans to the climate in the north.*\u201d\n* [Polish Archaeologists have Uncovered Nine Crocodile Heads Within Ancient Egyptian Tombs of Nobles](https:\/\/arkeonews.net\/polish-archaeologists-have-uncovered-nine-crocodile-heads-within-ancient-egyptian-tombs-of-nobles\/) \u2014 Nine crocodile heads were discovered within two tombs in the Theban Necropolis of Egypt. The tombs belong to a high-ranking official and a high-status member of the royal court. While crocodiles have been found entombed before, this find is unique, as stated by Patryk Chudzik, \u201c*In our case, things are different. Firstly, only the heads and not the entire bodies of these Nile reptiles have been deposited in the tombs where we work. Secondly, they were not mummified but only wrapped in linen (there is a significant difference in this, as no preservatives were used). Finally, the remains were found in the tombs of humans, not the catacombs of sacred animals.*\u201d\n* [Characterizing Red Pigment in Ancient Bone Samples in Peru to Reveal Their Sources](https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2022-12-characterizing-red-pigment-ancient-bone.html) \u2014 In a new study of red pigments used in funeral rites by the people of ancient Peru, researchers analyzed samples of red paint from bones and artifacts dated to between 1000 and 1825 CE. They found that most of the pigments were made with iron-based ochres like hematite, but others were made with cinnabar (a mercury-based pigment that you might remember from issue [\\#31](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/p\/ancient-beat-31-mercury-poisoning), when researchers noticed that Maya cities were contaminated with mercury\u2026 but I digress). The cinnabar was not native to the area, indicating that it was used for people of importance and\/or wealth. Also notable is that the remains with red pigment were mostly those of men. The pigment was applied either with textiles, leaves, or fingers, long after the deceased had been skeletonized. It is not clear when exactly the paint was applied to the bones, but according to the researchers, the paint may have been applied to protect loved ones from the European invaders.\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1672502611.0},{"title":"Young Sudanese archaeologists dig up history as \u2018west knows best\u2019 era ends","author":"avicfir","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/dec\/27\/young-sudanese-archaeologists-dig-up-history-as-west-knows-best-era-ends","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1672381000.0},{"title":"Medieval gold 'lynx' earrings from Ani Ruins set for 2023 exhibition","author":"blondekayla","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/lvbjc8eoyv8a1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1672340942.0},{"title":"'New'\/Processual Archaeology: An Introduction","author":"Faust_TSFL","url":"https:\/\/seaxeducation.substack.com\/p\/newprocessual-archaeology","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1672416632.0},{"title":"Hagood Petroglyphs in South Carolina, US.

The finds are more than 2,000 years old and include pyramids, platforms, ballcourts, reservoirs, and 110 miles of raised roads. According to the study, \u201c*The LiDAR survey revealed an extraordinary density and distribution of Maya sites concentrated in the MCKB, many of them linked directly or indirectly by a vast causeway network*.\u201d\n* [Tree Ring Study Suggests Drought Encouraged Attila\u2019s Huns to Attack the Roman Empire](https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2022\/12\/tree-ring-study-suggests-drought-encouraged-attilas-huns-to-attack-the-roman-empire\/145540) \u2014 A study of tree rings found that, rather than gold, it was extreme droughts from 430-450 CE that were behind Hunnic attacks on the Roman Empire. According to the study, the droughts caused migrations, a change in subsistence practices (mixing agricultural and pastoral diets), and a change in their social and political organization as they became raiders. According to Ulf B\u00fcntgen, \u201c*We found that periods of drought recorded in biochemical signals in tree-rings coincided with an intensification of raiding activity in the region.*\u201d Hunnic attacks on the Roman frontier increased when Attila came into power, and according to Susanne Hakenbeck, \u201c*Climate-induced economic disruption may have required Attila and others of high rank to extract gold from the Roman provinces to keep war bands and maintain inter-elite loyalties. Former horse-riding animal herders appear to have become raiders.*\u201d The Hunnic migration into eastern and central Europe is thought to have begun the barbarian migrations which led to the fall of the Roman Empire.\n* [Ancient Mexico's Solar Calendar in the Mountains Identified](https:\/\/www.space.com\/ancient-mexico-solar-observatory-accuracy) \u2014 A new study found that the Mexica used mountains in the Basin of Mexico (Mexico City) to track the sunrise. They were able to achieve incredible accuracy in monitoring seasonal variations and even accounted for leap years using this system. The researchers concluded that the ancient astronomers must have stood in one place to do this, and they then used manuscripts to track it down \u2014 a temple at the summit of Mount Tlaloc. And they even found a long causeway that aligns with the rising sun on February 24, which is the beginning of the Mexica new year. According to the researchers, the primary function of this was that when the sun rose at a certain point in the mountains, the Mexica knew to plant.\n* [Study Suggests Walking May Be Linked to Treetop Foraging](https:\/\/www.archaeology.org\/news\/11082-221216-chimpanzee-trees-walking) \u2014 While it was previously thought that our ancestors moved toward bipedalism when dense forests made way for woodlands and grasslands seven million years ago, it may have actually been an adaptation driven by foraging strategies on flexible treetop branches. A new study suggests this primarily because wild chimpanzees in woodlands and grasslands today spend an equal amount of time in trees to those in dense forests, despite there being fewer trees. This indicates that the decrease in trees is unlikely to have been the evolutionary stimulus.\n* [Stunning Grave Find Once Belonged to A Dark Age Female Church Leader](https:\/\/www.sciencealert.com\/stunning-grave-find-once-belonged-to-a-dark-age-female-church-leader) \u2014 Archaeologists unearthed a beautiful 30-piece necklace made with Roman coins, glass, and semi-precious stones. They also found two decorated pots, a copper dish, and a large silver cross decorated with unusual human faces. The grave is thought to be that of a high-ranking woman. Burying people with lots of grave goods tends to be a pagan notion, but Christian beliefs were obviously present in the burial too, indicating that the woman probably lived between 630 and 670 CE when pagan and Christian beliefs were still intertwined. This may have been one of the earliest women in Britain to be a leader in the church, and according to Levente-Bence Bal\u00e1z, \u201c*This is the most significant early medieval female burial ever discovered in Britain.*\u201d\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1671896833.0},{"title":"Making a Flint Knife from the Groswater Complex","author":"pathways_of_the_past","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/40bWMFI_8QA","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1671895010.0},{"title":"Archaeologists uncover oldest known projectile points in the Americas","author":"D-R-AZ","url":"https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2022-12-archaeologists-uncover-oldest-projectile-americas.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1671831417.0},{"title":"Looking for hidden beauty in the 3-in-1 Meidum Pyramid.","author":"MemoryTrap","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/1X1UAAPefas","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1671900151.0},{"title":"2,000-year-old candle discovered by local children in Israeli Kibbutz","author":"PhantomWizard2099","url":"https:\/\/www.jpost.com\/archaeology\/article-725338","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1671873303.0},{"title":"20 ancient tombs uncovered at site in northern Egypt","author":"PhantomWizard2099","url":"https:\/\/www.jpost.com\/archaeology\/article-725433","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1671873282.0},{"title":"The Ancient History Of Cheese","author":"avicfir","url":"https:\/\/www.thedailymeal.com\/1141049\/the-ancient-history-of-cheese\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1671868290.0},{"title":"Ancient Aboriginal rock art destroyed by vandals in \u2018tragic loss\u2019 at sacred SA site","author":"mhfc","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/artanddesign\/2022\/dec\/21\/ancient-aboriginal-rock-art-destroyed-by-vandals-in-tragic-loss-at-sacred-sa-site","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1671735495.0},{"title":"Viking Age grave containing remains of shield uncovered","author":"IslandChillin","url":"https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2022\/12\/viking-age-grave-containing-remains-of-shield-uncovered\/145628?fbclid=IwAR0x_ctKbLWJo97oG3GDdB83h4ycHSZHw21ICfyinHriadQ_vXX5vCteOIs&amp","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1671761650.0},{"title":"Will a future museum exhibit on our current era in history just be full of plastic objects?","author":"thescoobymike","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/zto7pa\/will_a_future_museum_exhibit_on_our_current_era\/","text":"I\u2019m picturing a plaque that reads like this:\n\nAD 2022.

But artifacts and sites from the Mississippian culture (Poverty Point for instance) suggest that hunter\/gatherers can engage in a sedentary lifestyle, ostensibly in situations of low geographic competition and high abundance. Other sites, like those from ancient Anatolia, suggest a similar conclusion. These sites share some common traits in addition to evidence of foraging, such as carved stone bowls in lieu of an absence of ceramic pottery, and no evidence of warfare.\n\nOr, instead, is it possible that agriculture is necessary for the development of civilizations and artifacts such as these, and we have it all wrong? Is it possible the full extent of their nutrition and resource production is lost to the record or undiscovered?

The 2,000-year-old glyphs include depictions of humans, birds, orcas, cats, snakes, and more. The reason that they had been missed previously was probably their size \u2014 many are only 10 to 20 feet across. Luckily, drones were able to find them with high-res cameras.\n* [Could Homo Naledi Control Fire?](https:\/\/www.archaeology.org\/news\/11047-221207-homo-naledi-fire) \u2014 Researchers have discovered remnants of hearths, including charred wood, burned animal bones, and soot, in the Rising Star cave complex of South Africa. What makes this particularly interesting is that the only human remains found to date in the caves are those of Homo naledi, a species that did not have control over fire\u2026 or so we thought. The naledi fossils date to 335,000-236,000 years ago, which is well within the timeline of fire usage, but they had small brains and were not thought to be capable. Of course, these findings are not conclusive. Indeed, the idea is quite controversial, with critics suggesting that the fires were built by visitors to the cave system, and that the bones were washed in by rain.\n* [Oldest Charred Food Remains Reveal Earliest Evidence of Plant Cooking by Neanderthals](https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/oldest-charred-food-remains-reveal-earliest-evidence-of-plant-cooking-by-neanderthals-12753290) \u2014 Analysis of some of the oldest charred food remains showed Neanderthals prepared food similar to Homo sapiens. The food pieces included seeds, wild pulses, wild mustard, wild nuts, and wild grasses, and could have been from porridge or patties. Some of the food fragments that were analyzed date back as far as 70,000 years. More recent fragments from up to 13,000 years ago may have made up a sort of proto-bread. From their analysis, the researchers were able to identify the ways in which Neanderthals and sapiens made their food edible, as well as the ways that they made it tastier \u2014 soaking, leaching, pounding, grinding, and even seasoning. According to Ceren Kabuku, \u201c*Our work conclusively demonstrates the deep antiquity of plant foods involving more than one ingredient and processed with multiple preparation steps*\u2026 *There were very ancient and sophisticated culinary traditions resting on these plant flavors.*\u201d\n* [Roman Coin Reveals Long-Lost Roman Emperor](https:\/\/www.heritagedaily.com\/2022\/11\/roman-coin-reveals-long-lost-roman-emperor\/145321) \u2014 New analysis of unusual Roman coins which were thought to be forgeries has shown that they are authentic. The coins depict an unknown Roman emperor named \u201cSponsian\u201d. He may have been an army officer who was forced to assume command in the Roman province of Dacia when it was cut off from the rest of the empire around 260 CE. It is assumed that he produced coins locally to cement his power, as he could not get official issues from Rome. According to Paul Pearson, \u201c*Scientific analysis of these ultra-rare coins rescues the emperor Sponsian from obscurity. Our evidence suggests he ruled Roman Dacia, an isolated gold mining outpost, at a time when the empire was beset by civil wars and the borderlands were overrun by plundering invaders.*\u201d\n* [Hominins Were Sailing the Mediterranean Half a Million Years Ago, Study Finds](https:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/archaeology\/2022-12-15\/ty-article\/hominins-were-sailing-the-mediterranean-half-a-million-years-ago-study-finds\/00000185-1590-dcb5-abe7-dfbe1b5c0000) \u2014 I think \u201csailing\u201d is a bit of a misnomer in the article\u2019s title, but a new study suggests that primitive hominins made short sea journeys in the Mediterranean Sea over half a million years ago. This is thanks to growing evidence of Mediterranean islands being populated for a very, very long time. They even found evidence that islands were populated multiple times by different hominins, so it was not a single event. The study showed that it would not have been possible for ancient humans to have simply walked to the Aegean Islands during a time of lower sea levels \u2014 there were times when the islands would have been one big island, but there still would have been at least 5 kilometers of sea between it and the mainland. According to Maria Gkioni, \u201c*The human species likes to explore new places, and we know they had visibility, they could see that perhaps there was a better place to find the resources they needed: food, water and stone.*\u201d Of course, we have no evidence of boats going back that far, and it\u2019s possible that they simply swam or drifted on a log. Even still, Gkioni went on to say, \u201c*All this means that these hominins already had advanced cognitive capabilities\u2026 To cross over and colonize an island you need to have collaboration, a common language, and complex communication*.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1671291382.0},{"title":"Notre Dame's spire had 2 hidden coffins beneath it.

Here are this week's Top 5 archaeological headlines:\n\n* [Fish fossils show first cooking may have been 600,000 years earlier than thought](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/science\/2022\/nov\/14\/fish-fossils-show-first-cooking-may-have-been-600000-years-earlier-than-thought) \u2014 Researchers examined remains from two particularly large species of carp found at the site of Gesher Benot Ya\u2019aqov in Israel and found that the fish had been cooked a whopping 780,000 years ago. If true, that makes this the oldest known use of fire for cooking\u2026 by, oh, only about 600,000 years! It\u2019s tough to pinpoint exactly when humans started cooking because it\u2019s hard to determine what an ancient hearth was used for, but the earliest definitive evidence comes from about 170,000 years ago. This study presents a decent amount of evidence, but the proof came in the enamel of the fish teeth. It showed evidence of being heated to 400-930 degrees Fahrenheit, which is a good range for well-done fish. We know that humans have been harnessing fire for at least 1.7 million years, so this may not be overly surprising, but it certainly adds a valuable data point \u2014 particularly because cooking had such a huge impact on our physiology.\n* [Roman Roads Laid The Foundation For Modern-Day Prosperity \u2013 New Study Claims](https:\/\/www.ancientpages.com\/2022\/11\/16\/roman-roads-laid-the-foundation-for-modern-day-prosperity-new-study-claims\/) \u2014 Roman roads, which totaled about 50,000 miles at their peak, were built primarily for the transport of soldiers. In the planning, very little thought was given to older roads or the villages on them, but that didn\u2019t stop trade from flowing or market towns from popping up along the roads. And a fascinating new study analyzed how these roads affected the transfer of wealth, finding that the western parts of the Roman Empire are still impacted by the roads ***to this day***. According to Ola Olsson, \u201c*Given that much has happened since, much should have been adapted to modern circumstances. But it is striking that our main result is that the Roman roads have contributed to the concentration of cities and economic activity along them, even though they are gone and covered by new roads*.\u201d The researchers say that after the Roman Empire fell, the chaos could have caused economic structures to reorient, but they didn\u2019t \u2014 there was a continuity of wealth. This is in contrast to what happened in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire, where wheeled transport was largely abandoned in favor of camel caravans, leading to the roads falling into disrepair. Here, the researchers actually found a \u201creversal of fortune\u201d, which can still be seen today.\n* [\u2018Puzzling\u2019 Archeological Find in Spain Uncovers Objects with Egyptian Motifs](https:\/\/english.elpais.com\/culture\/2022-11-13\/puzzling-archeological-find-in-spain-uncovers-objects-with-egyptian-motifs.html) \u2014 Excavations at the 2,700-year-old site of Cerro de San Vicente in Spain have recently revealed lots of artifacts with motifs originating in Egypt and other eastern Mediterranean cultures. The most recent is a piece of faience (glazed pottery) that would have once depicted the Egyptian goddess Hathor. The piece was deliberately placed among the adobe blocks of walls in the city, alongside a shark\u2019s tooth, beads, and a fragment of an amphora. This raises questions about how they got here \u2014 perhaps gifts or trade items from a Phoenician delegation, or the adoption of customs by the indigenous population of Salamanca.\n* [Hand of Irulegi: Ancient Bronze Artifact Could Help Trace Origins of Basque Language](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2022\/nov\/15\/hand-of-irulegi-ancient-spanish-artefact-rewrites-history-of-basque-language) \u2014 A 2,000-year-old, life-sized bronze hand was found in Pamplona, Spain last year, and its significance has recently become clear. Researchers studied the strange symbols on it and now believe it to be the oldest written example of Proto-Basque. This means that the Vascones, an Iron-Age tribe that lived in Spain, had a written language \u2014 it was previously thought written language came to the area with the Romans. The first and only word to be identified so far is \u201c*sorioneku*\u201d, which means \u201cgood luck\u201d or \u201cgood omen\u201d.\n* [Footprints Claimed as Evidence of Ice Age Humans in North America Need Better Dating, New Research Claims](https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2022-11-footprints-evidence-ice-age-humans.html) \u2014 In issue [\\#22](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/p\/-ancient-beat-22-fossilized-footprints), I covered ancient footprints in Utah, similar to those found in New Mexico last year that pushed back the date of the peopling of the Americas to 21,000-23,000 BP. Here\u2019s the inevitable rebuttal to the dating \u2014 not as exciting (at least to me), but an honest back-and-forth is the basis of good science. While not refuting the claims, the researchers rightly believe that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And their main argument is that the seeds that were dated are from a plant that grows underwater. Therefore, it gets much of its carbon from dissolved carbon atoms in the water, which can be quite a bit older. This is something that was acknowledged in the original paper. The researchers then demonstrated the effect by dating 75-year-old seeds of the same plant, and getting a result of 7,400 years. A 7,400-year difference would put the ancient seeds in line with a more mainstream timeline. Fascinating stuff. I\u2019ll keep an eye out to the rebuttal to the rebuttal. \ud83d\ude03\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1668873547.0},{"title":"Archaeologists carefully dig for history at Town Creek (North Carolina) Indian Mound","author":"avicfir","url":"https:\/\/www.wfae.org\/charlotte-area\/2022-11-18\/archaeologists-carefully-dig-for-history-at-town-creek-indian-mound","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1668897762.0},{"title":"a new interpretation of the paintings in chauvet cave","author":"scienceworksbitches","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/z0futa\/a_new_interpretation_of_the_paintings_in_chauvet\/","text":"Hi there,In the beginning of lock down I started catching up on all the new findings that came out in the field of archaeology and anthropology, spending hours looking at pictures and reading papers. a couple weeks ago I had an epiphany regarding the paintings in chauvet cave:[https:\/\/artsandculture.google.com\/story\/8QVRQAObSOFYJw](https:\/\/artsandculture.google.com\/story\/8QVRQAObSOFYJw)\n\nlets set the scene:there was an ice age going on, lions were not only direct competition, they would have seen us as prey. the whole cave is full of lion faces with weird eyes and lines, I think they were figuring out a way to teach the group what it means to be stalked. I assume lions would have evolved those face markings for this exact reason, to confuse the pattern recognition of prey animals (edit:  [Disruptive eye mask - Wikipedia](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Disruptive_eye_mask) ). But we were smat primates, so we figured out a way to adapt.The following will only describe the end results of that process, but most depictions look to me too be experiments with the mental process of rendering and abstracting 3d objects in 2d, rather parts of larger scenes. See also the aurochs mapped on the rock formation.\n\nlions:[https:\/\/artsandculture.google.com\/asset\/felines-chauvet-cave-ardche\/qgGSqKWKXbqc9A](https:\/\/artsandculture.google.com\/asset\/felines-chauvet-cave-ardche\/qgGSqKWKXbqc9A)the upper three and two eyed versions were pretty close and look like the first time they overcame the \u201cstripes fucking up the pattern recognition\u201d defense. But the real eureka moment had to be the middle one in the lower row, its clearly staring at you, ready to pounce, notice also the paws and the arched back. That isnt a realistic depiction ofc, predatory animals cant look sideway, its more like an engineering drawing.The third lion looks to be showing submissive behavior, but it looks to me to be more than just that, you can see the fear in its face. Maybe it was their reaction when we were stalking them as a group, with spears and fire?\n\nHorses:[https:\/\/artsandculture.google.com\/asset\/horses-panel-chauvet-cave-l-guichard\/EAFt0\\_050-lJCQ](https:\/\/artsandculture.google.com\/asset\/horses-panel-chauvet-cave-l-guichard\/EAFt0_050-lJCQ)they were clearly not stalking us, so it was us doing the stalking, the lowest one is depicting the flehmen response, maybe it meant you are being \u201esmelled\u201c, the next one appears to be have the ears towards the observer.The upper two i thought to be submissive and dominating behavior, but now im not so sure. There is something fucked with the depiction, it looks as if there are three heads, but the one in the middle has no face. Maybe someone with experience in horse behavior can tell more despite the low quality, could it be the different behavior horses were showing towards humans?\n\nSo, what are you saying?

Here's the latest ancient news:\n\n* [Vast Tunnel Found Beneath Ancient Egyptian Temple](https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/ancient-tunnel-found-under-egyptian-temple) \u2014 A tunnel has been discovered beneath a temple in the ancient city of Taposiris Magna in Egypt. The tunnel is an incredible 4,281 feet long, which is about 1,000 feet shy of a mile. It is 6.6 feet tall, and it\u2019s located 65 feet beneath the ground. It\u2019s also an exact replica of Eupalinos in Greece, which is considered an engineering marvel. The tunnel was used to bring water to thousands of people when it was functional, sometime in the Ptolemaic period (304-30 BCE). Much of it is now underwater and\/or destroyed by earthquakes. Two alabaster heads (an unidentified king and a high-ranking person), parts of statues of deities, and coins were also found within. And as I looked into this, I found a number of sources citing this as a tunnel that leads to Cleopatra\u2019s tomb. This seems to be because the person who discovered it said that it\u2019s a possibility, even if it\u2019s unlikely. It has by no means been confirmed, and I think the coolness of this discovery stands on its own.\n* [Enigmatic Footprints Reveal Humans were in Spain 200,000 Years Earlier than Previously Thought](https:\/\/www.ancientpages.com\/2022\/11\/11\/enigmatic-footprints-reveal-humans-were-in-spain-200000-years-earlier-than-previously-thought\/) \u2014 Researchers recently applied an optically-stimulated luminescence technique on hominin footprints that were found at the site of Matalasca\u00f1as in Spain back in 2020. They found that they are 200,000 years older than previously thought! This pushes back the date for a hominin presence in what is now Spain, and makes it likely that pre-Neanderthals (possibly Homo heidelbergensis) lived in the area 295,800 years ago.\n* [Italy Hails 'Exceptional' Discovery of Ancient Bronze Statues in Tuscany](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/europe\/exceptional-discovery-ancient-bronze-statues-emerge-tuscany-2022-11-08\/) \u2014 A whopping 24 large bronze statues, along with several statuettes, from Roman times have been unearthed in the ruins of an ancient bathhouse in San Casciano dei Bagni, Italy. The statues, dating to between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE, are in excellent condition and depict Hygieia, Apollo, and other Greco-Roman deities. According to the researchers, these would have stood in a sanctuary before they were immersed in the thermal pools in some sort of ritual in the 1st century CE. 6,000 coins were found on top of them, though it\u2019s unclear to me whether they were thrown in with the statues, or over the course of time after the ritual took place \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a bit of both.\n* [Protective Childbirth Tattoos Found on Ancient Egyptian Mummies](https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/ancient-egyptian-mothers-protective-tattoos-childbirth) \u2014 A new paper showed that tattoos discovered on six ancient women at the New Kingdom site of Deir el-Medina (1550-1070 BCE) in Egypt were likely used for protection during childbirth. One of the tattoos, which was on a woman\u2019s lower back, shows a depiction of the god Bes and a bowl, imagery related to ritual purification done after childbirth. Another shows a wedjat (Eye of Horus), a zigzag that might represent a marsh, and possibly Bes wearing a feathered crown, all of which relate to protection and healing. Interestingly, clay figurines found at the site decades ago also show what might be a tattoo of Bes on the lower back. Bes was revered as a protector of women and children, especially during childbirth. According to the researchers, \u201c*When placed in context with New Kingdom artifacts and texts, these tattoos and representations of tattoos would have visually connected with imagery referencing women as sexual partners, pregnant, midwives, and mothers participating in the post-partum rituals used for protection of the mother and child.*\u201d\n* [Cats Trash Theory That They Followed First Farmers to Europe](https:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/archaeology\/2022-11-09\/ty-article\/cats-trash-theory-that-they-followed-first-farmers-to-europe\/00000184-573f-dc83-a7fd-ff7fac710000) \u2014 In true cat fashion, ancient cats have pushed a theory right off the table, breaking it to pieces. All domestic cats are descended from the African wildcat, and it was thought that these cats followed the first farmers to Europe from the Near East. But it turns out that the cats got to Europe first. A new study used palaeogenetics, zooarchaeology, and carbon dating to date the remains of roughly 200 ancient cats, and they found that African wildcats were in Poland 8,000 years ago \u2014 centuries before farming reached Poland, and 1,500 years earlier than previously thought. Perhaps they spread with traders instead of farmers, or perhaps they actually had more range than we thought. Cats never truly got domesticated, but they started hanging out with us during the Neolithic Revolution in the Near East around 10,000 years ago. Makes sense. Farming = surpluses = mice = cats. The article talks a lot about the history of cats, so if you\u2019re a cat lover, check it out.\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1668269165.0},{"title":"Flintknapping an Oxbow point and Ice Patch Archaeology","author":"pathways_of_the_past","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/NSj0UiuAna4","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1668276492.0},{"title":"Emp\u00faries archaeologists find the remains of a 6th century BC sanctuary possibly dedicated to Demeter - time.news","author":"timberlake123","url":"https:\/\/time.news\/empuries-archaeologists-find-the-remains-of-a-6th-century-bc-sanctuary-possibly-dedicated-to-demeter\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1668263098.0},{"title":"No Pharaohs found in pyramids?","author":"harnasje","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/yt9zze\/no_pharaohs_found_in_pyramids\/","text":"I've read that no pharaohs have ever been found in pyramids.

I'd rather play it safe and spend money on a laptop that will be able to be used as broadly as possible for as long as possible.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1668039240.0},{"title":"Ivory lice comb - a dating head-scratcher - may hold earliest Canaanite sentence","author":"xland44","url":"https:\/\/www.timesofisrael.com\/ivory-lice-comb-a-dating-head-scratcher-may-hold-earliest-canaanite-sentence\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1667975231.0},{"title":"Mystery tunnel found under ancient temple could lead to Cleopatra's lost tomb","author":"FleurMai","url":"https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/news\/world\/mystery-tunnel-found-under-ancient-temple-could-lead-to-cleopatra-s-lost-tomb\/ar-AA13S7NO?OCID=ansmsnnews11","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1667939781.0},{"title":"Mosaic floor with Dionysus\u2019 head from a Roman villa, 2nd\u20143rd century, Corinth","author":"Fabianzzz","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/rkzktb6zojy91.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1667921702.0},{"title":"Discovery of 24 bronze statues in an ancient Tuscan thermal spring rewrites Italy\u2019s Etruscan-Roman history","author":"Miss-Figgy","url":"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/travel-europe-museums-821ea64144e67887773cb8ec2e95a147","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1667913384.0},{"title":"Protective childbirth tattoos found on ancient Egyptian mummies","author":"HybridHawkOwl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/yq1mlv\/protective_childbirth_tattoos_found_on_ancient\/","text":"Is it still a tramp stamp if you get inked to protect yourself during childbirth? \n\nIt turns out some mothers in ancient Egypt got tattoos associated with Bes, a deity who protected women and children, especially during childbirth.

Here are this week's Top 5 archaeological headlines:\n\n* [Sex With Humans \u2013 Not Climate Change, Disease or War \u2013 Spelled the End for Neanderthals, Scientists Believe](https:\/\/www.independent.ie\/world-news\/europe\/britain\/sex-with-humans-not-climate-change-disease-or-war-spelled-the-end-for-neanderthals-scientists-believe-42106899.html) \u2014 After reading the title of this article, I wondered how long it would take for a \u201cmake love, not war\u201d joke to make an appearance. It took two sentences. Many of us will know that there are a ton of theories out there as to why Neanderthals went extinct. Well, a new paper proposed that rather than war, climate change, etc., it may have been about sex. We find Neanderthal DNA in Homo sapiens, but we don\u2019t find sapiens DNA in neanderthals, which suggests that Neanderthals were joining Homo sapiens groups, and this may have left fewer breeding-age people in Neanderthal communities. According to Chris Stringer, \u201c*If Homo sapiens were breeding into the Neanderthal gene pool it was very rare, or it was not successful,*\u201d the latter alluding to the fact that hybridization sometimes only works in one direction. He went on to say, \u201c*Perhaps Homo sapiens groups acted like sponges in absorbing pockets of late Neanderthals, and maybe that, as much as anything else, led to the eventual demise of the Neanderthals as a viable population.*\u201d\n* [Ancient DNA Reveals a Hidden History of Human Adaptation](https:\/\/theconversation.com\/ancient-dna-reveals-a-hidden-history-of-human-adaptation-193251) \u2014\u00a0A new study analyzed genetic data from over a thousand people who lived in Europe and Asia over the last 45,000 years. The researchers found 50 \u201chard sweeps\u201d, where a rare and beneficial genetic variant swept through a population rapidly after a change in conditions. One of the most notable hard sweeps occurred in early Anatolian farmers, and it affected a genetic region associated with the immune system. Changes in the immune system make a lot of sense to me, at a time when their lifestyles became more sedentary. While hard sweeps have been noted in other species, there hasn\u2019t been much evidence in humans until now. Some say it is rare because our cultural innovations have made hard sweeps largely unnecessary. Others say they happen, but they\u2019re more subtle in humans. But this study suggests that if genetic mixing events (e.g. migrations), which obscure hard sweeps, are widespread, hard sweeps might have been much more common than we thought. And if true, this would indicate that human ingenuity and cultural innovation have not always been enough to overcome environmental challenges \u2014 sometimes evolution lends a hand.\n* [Coins, Shells, Almond Kernels - New Finds in Ephesus](https:\/\/www.indonewyork.com\/breaking\/archaeology-coins-shells-almond-kernels-new-finds-in-ephesus-2-h51352.html) \u2014 A fascinating window into ancient business practices has been discovered at the ancient city of Ephesus in Turkey. A well-preserved Byzantine commercial and dining district was unearthed, and several business premises have been excavated in an area of 170 square meters. According to the coins (four gold and 700 copper) found at the site, these businesses date to about 615 CE. The rooms excavated to date include a cookshop, storage room, tavern, lamp shop, souvenir shop for Christian pilgrims, and a workshop with an adjoining sales room. Also found were bottles made for pilgrims, crockery, seafood, fruit, nuts, legumes, and more. All of this is beneath a fire layer, which is why it is so well-preserved.\n* [Stones Found in Turkey's Kayseri Province Reveal a 1700-Year-Old Biodynamic Agricultural Calendar](https:\/\/www.archeotips.com\/post\/stones-found-in-turkey-s-kayseri-province-reveal-a-1700-year-biodynamic-agricultural-calendar) \u2014 Researchers analyzed red markings found on five cut stones that were discovered nearly a decade ago in Develi, Turkey. They found that the markings are a 1,700-year-old biodynamic agricultural calendar. Farmers were using these stones to schedule activities according to the positions of the moon and stars. The calendar was used in the Roman period and is the first known example in Anatolia.\n* [Lidar Survey Reveals Urban Sprawl of Ancient Maya City](https:\/\/www.archaeology.org\/news\/10955-221028-mexico-maya-calakmul) \u2014 A 36-square-mile lidar survey has revealed a large urban settlement with residential compounds clustered around temples, shrines, and (possibly) marketplaces. All of this was found in the area of Calakmul in Mexico, which was the capital of the Kaanul dynasty between 635 and 850 CE. The settlement was supported by an agricultural system with canals, terraces, walls, and dams. This indicates that Calakmul may have been the most crowded ancient Maya urban center during their peak \u2014 even denser than Tikal. Previous estimates placed the city at 50,000 inhabitants, but this now needs to be recalculated.\n\nThanks for reading this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https:\/\/ancientbeat.substack.com\/?utm_source=rarchaeology) \u2014\u00a0have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1667659851.0},{"title":"Dominican mission discovers 1,305-meter Greco-Roman ancient rock-cut tunnel in Alexandria","author":"haberveriyo","url":"https:\/\/arkeonews.net\/dominican-mission-discovers-1305-meter-greco-roman-ancient-rock-cut-tunnel-in-alexandria\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1667580813.0},{"title":"How to spot evidence of cannibalism on human remains","author":"antipinkkitten","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0jFBhDwOTJ8","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1667591016.0},{"title":"Toltec Mounds renamed Plum Bayou Mounds","author":"scoutpotato","url":"https:\/\/archeology.uark.edu\/who-we-are\/research-stations\/toltec-renamed-plum-bayou-mounds\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1667568623.0},{"title":"Ulpiana Church","author":"blondekayla","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/vklivwhcosx91","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1667506993.0},{"title":"RePAIR Project at Pompeii Aims to Reconstruct Ancient Frescoes","author":"Squirrel005","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Archaeology\/comments\/ylx5t8\/repair_project_at_pompeii_aims_to_reconstruct\/","text":"RePAIR, funded by the European Union, is a collaboration between computer scientists, robotics engineers, and archaeologists in reconstructing shattered ancient artifacts, like beautiful paintings in the ancient ruins of Pompeii.
