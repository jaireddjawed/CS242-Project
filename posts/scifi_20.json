        "text": "# \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/143looiczvea1.gif\n\n# Humans are Weird – Pop Ups\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal Post: [http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-pop-ups](http://www.authorbettyadams.com/bettys-blog/humans-are-weird-pop-ups)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bright noonday sun shown down on the recreation area. Travel streams wandered lazily around the various surfaces before gathering in a central pool. The water sparkled with artificial cleanliness as it moved and Seventh Flap wrinkled his nose-flaps in irritation at the near blinding light it reflected. He supposed the health regulations required sterile waterways but it was so clearly unnatural that it set his sensory horns tingling. He gave the horns an idle rub with one wing hook as he used the other to position the meal orb better in his teeth.\n\nThe orb was a positive delight compared to the usual half formed buds they got at their home station. It tasted tree-grown. No matter what the nutritionists said about chemical content he could always taste the difference between tree and vat grown batches. He idly rotated the orb, licking up the outer layer as the fluid beaded on the side.\n\nHis attention was drawn to a pair of humans who appeared to be sneaking across the recreations yard. The sight of a sneaking human was always entertaining to watch. The behemoths shouldn’t have any chance of stealth, and yet a well trained human could move below the ambient sound threshold with surprising ease.  He grinned as he listened to their whispered conversation. These were clearly not well trained.\n\nThe humans were crouched down below the ridge of one of the artificial hills. They were clearly not bothering to hide themselves from anyone at elevation so the object of their focus must be fairly low. There were no Shatar on the grounds at the moment and the Gathering were so oblivious in this kind of sunlight that there would be no reason to sneak around them. Seventh Flap  followed their trajactory for a moment and then followed it out.\n\nAs he had expected there was a pair of Undulates ambling along the edge of a stream on the other side of the ridge from the humans. Adding the vectors made it clear that the humans intended to intercept them where the long hill ended.\n\nSeventh Flap gave his meal orb another lick and the taste came up empty. He grunted and tucked the empty orb into his carry pouch. He took to wing and caught a thermal that allowed him to perch with a much better view of the vector meet.\n\nThe humans had paused and pulled something out of a sack. They looked like helmets  of some sort. They had clearly been modified to resemble the gaping maw of some predatory species. The humans dawned the helmets and dropped down resting their hands on the ground.\n\nSeventh Flap started up in astonishment. The literature on humans, and everything he had personally seen. Indicated that they were strictly bipedal. But these two were scrambling along as easily as any Gathering. They had altered their vectors several times by this point and he was beginning to suspect he was wrong about their intended destination but they increased their horizontal speed and reached the end of the hill several body lengths ahead of the Undulated. There the humans stopped and crouched in a predatory manner.\n\nSeventh Flap felt a prickle of unease run across his horns. While he didn’t know any of the individuals involved he was fairly certain that the humans bore the Undulates no ill will. However that was a very predatory pose. He shook out his horns and firmly reminded himself that if a human wanted to harm an Undulate they hardly needed to sneak up on them to do it. Still he watched closer. The Undulates rounded the curve of the hill and the humans pounced.\n\nThat is to say they both pounced about three wings forward, raised their hands over their heads, and emitted a low rumbling sound. The Undulates idly turned to the humans and gave a happy sort of wriggle in greeting. The humans stood there uncertainly and finally returned the gesture with a wave. The darker Undulate lifted a few appendages curiously.\n\n“Is this the normal greeting for your subculture Human Acquaintance Smythe?” the Undulate asked. “I have not seen one like it before.”\n\n“Ah, no,” the human replied in a surprised tone.\n\n“Well thank you for sharing a rare greeting with us,” the Undulate replied. “My colleague regrets that she cannot converse with you but she has not yet learned English.”\n\n“No probs,” the human reassured them. “Have fun on your amble.”\n\nAfter a few more cursory exchanges the Undulates did indeed continue on. The humans stood there a few moments longer before taking off the modified helmets and exchanging confused glances. Seventh Flap was feeling generous now that he had a full belly and decided to relieve their confusion.  He took to wing and came up behind them, making sure to stay in the overlap of their blind spots. He went into a glide just outside of their hearing and dove. The humans were caught completely unaware as he latched onto the center of one’s back.\n\nThe human’s response was more than satisfactory. Seventh Flap wasn’t aware that grown human males could generate sounds that high in the register. The reaction was however short lived, and the scream quickly turned to laughter.\n\n“Who are you?” demanded the other human.\n\n“I am Seventh Flap,” he replied. “And I thought I’d answer your question.”\n\n“What question was that?” the human he was clinging to asked.\n\n“Why you failed to get a jump reaction out of the Undulates,” Seventh Flap explained as he detached and circled them until one held out a hand for him to perch on.\n\n“Yeah?” the human who he landed on replied. “Why was  that? Did they see us coming?”\n\n“No,” Seventh Flap replied. “Your stealth was more than sufficient for an Undulate.”\n\n“Then why?” the human asked with a wave in the direction of the still ambling Undulates.\n\n“There are no predator species on their planet,” Seventh Flap explained, pulling his faced into a smug grin. “*They* have no jump scare reflex. I must say it will be nice to have people we can really play with on the base now.”\n\nHe took off to let them ponder that. As he flew out of hearing range he heard one human say to the other.\n\n“What did we just get ourselves into?”\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [​Book Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n# Please Leave Reviews on the Newest Book!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/10nrqfr/echoes_in_between_is_a_fantastic_science_horror/",
        "text": "Sometimes life is unfair.  A good audio drama does a bad audio drama’s death.  You do everything right, and things beyond your control lead to your downfall.  I’ve known several audio drama that had this happen, but the one I want to bring to discuss is Echoes (in) Between. \n\nEchoes (in) Between starts with an in-universe podcast of the same name. It is hosted by Gemma Avots and Thomas Fonte. They are exploring the concept of memory. More importantly, how we might retrieve memories. They are assisted by Dr. Adrian Thorne. The good doctor has developed a series of sound waves capable of stimulating people’s memory. At first, it seems to work remarkably well. Gemma, Thomas, and their listeners all begin to recall memories that were either hazy or completely lost. Then strange things begin to happen. Gemma and Thomas start remembering each other’s memories, and they begin to hear voices. Gemma and Thomas are going to do whatever it takes to uncover the truth behind the recordings. But what they will discover is beyond anything they could have imagined. \n\nI’d know about Echoes (in) Between for a while.   The show’s Twitter account followed me, and they were always really good about liking my posts for Audio Drama Sunday. But I got hit by a lot of requested reviews, so I kept putting it off.  I needed time for myself.  Sometimes, I need to be able to just listen to a show without taking mental notes, or immediately reviewing it after I finish it.\n\nSeries creator Jessica Berson followed me on Twitter, and I took that as a hint. Probably should have taken the hint back when Echoes (in) Between first followed me. It was around this time that I learned some troubling news. There had been issues behind the scenes, and Jessica had a falling out with her partner Bronson Metcalfe. Bronson decided to leave Echoes (in) Between, which was a bit of a problem given that he voices Thomas. Ultimately, Jessica decided to end Echoes (in) Between after only a single season. \n\nI doubt it would have made any difference if I hadn’t dragged my feet. Still, hearing how far all of that was for Jessica made me feeling incredibly guilty. \n\nHow do I describe this show in a non-spoiler way?  Well, this is one of the scariest audio dramas I’ve listened to in a long time.  I knew, intellectually, that it was all just a fictional show. All the same, I’d still sometimes get nervous and tense-up whenever the sound tapes were played. I know that probably sounds stupid, but I guess that makes Echoes (in) Between effectively scary. \n\nAutistic people have exceptionally good memory and recall.  That’s certainly true for myself.  Of course, that also means that I’m excellent at recalling all of the bad experiences that have happened to me.  And they’ll be just as sharp as when I first experienced them.  So, I really did not want to be stricken with the Curse of Mnemosyne. \n\nThe dialog is edited so that it often slightly overlaps. Jessica says that this is so that it mimics natural speaking. That is true, people often interrupt each other, or talk over each other, in real life. It also really love the intro and outro music for the in-universe podcast, which also serves the same function for the out of universe Echoes (in) Between audio drama. The audio drama does a good job of building a growing sense of mystery and creating an atmosphere of suspense\n\nWithout getting into too big spoilers, I will say that Echoes (in) Between involved parallel universe, contacting people from those universes, and Jungian Psychology.  \n\nIt is certainly unfortunate that Echoes (in) Between had to end as it did. But there is a light in the darkness. When Jessica Berson next commits to making an audio drama, and I have no doubt that she will, I know it will be absolutely fantastic. Jessica has proven to be a very talented writer, and an excellent voice actress. This isn’t the end for her, it is only the beginning. I look forward to what she will bring us in the future.\n\nMy only regret is that I didn’t get to Echoes (in) Between sooner. It is a fantastic science horror audio drama with some strong psychological themes. Don’t make the same mistake that I did. I strongly encourage all of you to give Echoes (in) Between a listen as soon as possible. And best of luck to Jessica in all her future endeavors. I’ll try not to wait so long next time. \n\nHave you listened to Echoes (in) Between?  If so, what did you think?\n\nLink to the full review on my blog: https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-audio-file-echoes-in-between.html?m=1",

It really shows how the creator didn't do research and thinks every single nation on earth except America will collapse and then reform into neo version of themselves.\n\n There hasn't been a single example of that in the real world that's resulted in a prosperous nation (look at the middle east)\n\n\nHere's my idea for Sci-Fi alternate future American societies!\n\n\n##Timeline 1\n\n[2049] The Socialist States of America (China  becomes a super power in the 2020s and 30s and is able to conquer the States! They will turn America into a society like China is right now except its like 1984 where everybody is brainwashed by the government and spied on 24/7!)\n\n[2067] Neo-Republic revolutionaries are able to conquer some of the SSA (Socialist States of America) and form The Second Republic of America\n\n[2070] The Second Republic conquers the SSA\n\n[2077] The Second Republic is renamed The Reunited States of America (I know very corny name, but America is extremely cheesy and that sounds exactly like something they would name it if that happens)\n\n\n##Timeline 2 (Civil War)\n\n[2017] Donald Trump is successfully assassinated by extreme libertarian terrorists and this created intensive divide and tension within the country which results in Civil War with Democrats fighting the Republicans\n\n[2035] After over a decade of conflict and back and forth, neither side can fully overpower the other. Due to the ramifications the war has had on all of the world economy and the inhabitants of the country, both sides sign a treaty to separate the nation in half. With Republicans on one side, and Democrats on the other\n\n[2036] The American Republic is formed alongside The American Union\n\n[2050] Neo-Confederate separatists seek to own parts of South of North America and have independence as a country. Neo-Confederate revolutionaries start a Civil War in the American Republic\n\n[2053] Neo-Confederacy wins the Civil War and the New Confederacy is born\n\n[2060] North America is a place full of conflict and never-ending wars between all three of the countries within it, with even more states attempting to branch out and as a result it become more divided. \n\n\n##Timeline 3 (New World Order)\n\n[2027] The US joins the United Nations World Order\n\n[2125] After ages, the imperialistic oppressive omnipresent regime is able to conquer that last free country in the world. Every now and then a terrorist shows up claiming to be liberating society from their imperialist omnipresent omniscient overlords, but it is simply futile. You will own nothing and be happy.

This seems very much over the top.  \nI had hopped richard would notice this, and at one moment I thought he had since it was written he was holding back a question, but he never asked Eagle if he was wondering it.  \nbasically, im asking what the purpose for it is? is it simply the creatures onboard somehow grew up in over 1000 Gs and prefer that gravity? or for some other purpose?

        "text": "Question...\n\nCan anyone recommend a good far-future science fiction detective series? Not necessarily something gritty like Blade Runner. Just a murder \"who done it\" set 200 to 300+ years in the future and perhaps in far-flung places of the galaxy.\n\nStandalone novels are appreciated, but really looking for a series that follows the detective on crazy mystery adventures in the future.",

        "text": "In the cold emptiness of space, a lone spaceship drifted along its pre-programmed course. The ship was crewed by a small group of humans, who had long since grown accustomed to the monotony of their journey. But they were not alone on the ship. Accompanying them were a group of cats, who had been taken along for the journey as a form of pest control.\n\nAt first, the cats seemed to be doing their job well, keeping the ship free of any vermin that might have found their way aboard. But as the weeks and months passed, the crew began to notice strange behavior from the felines. They would often be found staring intently into the darkness of space, as if they were communicating with something beyond the reach of human understanding.\n\nOne night, while the crew was asleep, the cats suddenly became frenzied, racing through the ship's corridors and making unearthly noises. The crew awoke in alarm, but before they could take any action, the cats had disappeared into the bowels of the ship.\n\nThe crew searched the ship frantically, but the cats were nowhere to be found. Suddenly, the ship's systems began to malfunction, the engines shut down and the lights went out. In the darkness, the crew could hear the cats' voices, whispering in a language that was not meant for human ears.\n\nAs the ship drifted helplessly through space, the crew realized that the cats were not simply pests, but were in fact alien entities that had taken on the form of cats to infiltrate the ship. The cats' true nature was that of an ancient and malevolent race, seeking to use the ship as a means of spreading their influence throughout the galaxy.\n\nThe crew fought desperately against the alien cats, but it was a losing battle. The ship was consumed by the darkness, and the crew was lost, never to be heard from again. The ship continued to drift through space, its dark secret still aboard, waiting for another unsuspecting crew to come across it.\n\nThis is how the legend of the \"Catship\" began to spread among the stars, as a warning to all who would dare to venture too far into the abyss of space.\n\nThe author suggests the following title: **\"The Whispers in the Dark: A Lovecraftian Cat-astrophe\"**",
