I would love to have some input from kind Internet strangers who are into biology and life sciences and are fascinated by the world around us.\n\nBackground Info: I am a business graduate. And after my degree, I got work experience and focused on family. The next logical step in my studies would be to do MS in business related field and perhaps land a better job. Right now, I cannot do studies on campus and would prefer long distance learning. \n\nIn my quest of learning more, I am considering the possibility of doing another Bachelors degree in Bio related field, biotechnology to be exact. I want to do it because I have always loved biology. It was my favourite subject at school and nature documentries always fascinated me. Perhaps, I could learn more and turn it into a career that I am passionate about. This bachelors degree would be online and is something I can afford at the moment.\n\nSo, should I go for BS Biotechnology while raising a family and have the option for MS in either biology related field or business related field. OR should I stick to my current career path and find an online MS in business related field?",

        "text": " \n\nThe mycorrhiza, the root fungi, are probably among the most underappreciated organisms on this planet. I think many people have a vague notion that they exist, but have no idea how crucial they are to life as we know it.\n\nIndeed, **without mycorrhiza there would be no plants and no animals on land!** Well, maybe they would have made it eventually, but they would probably look very different. All land plants are the descendants of *one* common ancestor that could only make it out of the water because the fungi in the soil were helping it to survive, to get water and nutrients. Only later did plants develop roots. And the first animals on land were arthropods, insects and spiders and such, and they were eating fungi and plants. So without the symbiosis of plants and fungi they couldn’t have survived there either.\n\nAnd don’t think that modern plants don’t need the fungi anymore because they have roots! Almost all plants are still in constant symbiosis with the mycorrhiza fungi. All root tips are surrounded and permeated by fungi filaments and they help the plant get water and nutrients out of the soil, especially phosphorus. And in return they get some sugar from the plants that they produce via photosynthesis. Indeed, some plants, like orchids, can’t even germinate without the right kind of fungus present. So an orchid alone can’t live. **Every orchid is kind of a plant-fungus hybrid creature. But indeed, you could pretty much say that of all plants**. Without mycorrhiza fungi they can’t grow as well. Mycorrhiza are just as much a part of being a plant than roots or leaves.\n\nOf course you’ve seen albino animals, but **have you heard of albino plants?** These plants are completely white. They don’t have any chlorophyll, can't do *any* photosynthesis. So how can they survive? They get all their nutrients from the fungal network. Sometimes I read that other plants give them some of their energy, but this again is a very plantist view. It’s actually the fungi that redistribute the nutrients between the plants. The plants don’t have much say in it at all. And why do the fungi do that? Keep alive a hungry mouth that doesn’t give anything back? Well, maybe it’s just an accident? Maybe if the fungi “knew” what’s going on, they would stop? Meaning the albino plants are straight up parasites? Or maybe they do give something back. Maybe their thick roots help with making the soil accessible. **And maybe they provide something potentially even more valuable: Information**. For the vast fungal network, feeding one plant might not be a large cost at all. But the albino tree is one more node in the network, a sensory organ.\n\nPlants are amazing creatures for sure, but for some of their cool abilities fungi should actually get the credit. Here, have you heard of something like this before: There are plants, when they get eaten by caterpillars, they produce a scent that attracts wasps that lay eggs in the caterpillar and then that’s the end for the hungry hungry caterpillar… So this is pretty cool, a plant calling the enemy of their enemy to get rid of them. But what’s even cooler is that other plants nearby also realize what’s going on and call the wasps, even though there are no caterpillars on them! This is often celebrated as an example of communication and collaboration in plants. But rarely do the fungi get the credit! Do you know how the other plant knows that one of them is eaten by caterpillars? The fungi tell them! And if you wanted to make the case, you could spin it into a more fungi-centric narrative (and of course that’s what I’ll do here) and say that **the fungus is raising it’s plants like a farmer and when caterpillars threaten its crops, it makes sure to have them call for the wasps** and tells its other plants to do the same. So really, it’s a story about amazing awareness and coordination and husbandry in fungi! The plants are just along for the ride. The true narrative is probably somewhere between these two, but my point is, don’t forget and underestimate the fungi.\n\nThe mycorrhiza connect all plants and other fungi. And both also communicate with animals. It is, therefore, no exaggeration to say that all living things of an island or a continent are connected by a web, exchanging resources and information. Just like in James Cameron’s Avatar, which was in fact inspired by the mycorrhiza fungi. Sadly, we can’t really browse the wood wide web. We’d have to learn the language of the fungi first.",

Does anyone have any recommendation on any books I could have a read over that would cover these areas? \n(Copy and pasted the module brief below) \n\nBasic cell theory i.e. what is a cell? \n• Macromolecules, the building blocks of cells e.g. proteins, carbohydrates and lipids and the genetic code e.g. DNA  \n• Cell structures within cells (e.g. cytoskeleton, mitochondria) and how they function within the cell i.e. signalling\n• Bacteria and viruses, their structure and function",

Is the advantage that males can hunt and protect the household/tribe from invaders, while females carry children and raise them, or is that hypothesis incredibly sexist?",

The human body plan just doesn’t work very well above a certain size for many reasons, though I’m just addressing, specifically, the circulatory system here and how you think blood could be pumped through a bipedal body plan for a terrestrial organism of say, twenty-five feet in height. I am ignoring the many other problems for the time being. \n\nI was thinking myself that looking at hydraulics might be a good place to start. \n\nEssentially, use the pressure created by deoxygenated blood flowing downwards to push a muscle upwards that in turn pushed oxygenated blood downwards, and a parallel but inverse organ for the lower body.",
