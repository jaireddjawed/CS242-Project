        "text": "Yes, this happened... Wtf?! Here is a warning, don't trust everything ChatGPT says to you...\n\nAlso, i looked on the search and i have not found an alike topic in this sub. So i though i should share for other people that ran into the same problem. Not sure if this is the right sub for it, but i think so, because this is not a question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what happened is that i was messing up with my system while being guided by ChatGPT and i think one of the packages i installed messed up with \"sudoers\". I lost my access to \"sudo\". So asked ChatGPT how to fix it and it is now fixed, here is the ChatGPT answer:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I apologize for the confusion. If you are unable to use sudo and your user is not in the sudoers file, you will need to boot your Arch Linux system into single-user mode and then modify the `/etc/sudoers` file to add your user to the sudoers list.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here are the steps to follow:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Boot your system into single-user mode by rebooting the system and pressing the e key when you see the GRUB bootloader menu.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Find the line that starts with `linux`, and add `init=/bin/bash` to the end of the line.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Press `Ctrl+X` or `F10` to boot into single-user mode.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Once you are in single-user mode, remount the root filesystem with read-write permissions by running the following command:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;`mount -o remount,rw /`  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Now you can modify the `/etc/sudoers` file using your preferred text editor. For example:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;`nano /etc/sudoers`  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Find the line that says `%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL`, and uncomment it by removing the `#` character at the beginning of the line.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Save and exit the file.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Exit the single-user mode by running the following command:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;`exec /sbin/init`  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Once your system has booted normally, add your user to the `wheel` group by running the following command:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;`sudo usermod -aG wheel yourusername`  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After completing these steps, your user should be able to use `sudo` again.",

Well they can cover a vast majority of the bases...Microsoft Office is a superior product. This is coming from someone that daily uses Libre + Thunderbird. However Microsoft Office is a better product, it just is. And to be honest the other office software competitors simply don't have the capital to compete at the level Microsoft does. Microsoft MAKES HUGE SUMS OF money off businesses who employ Microsoft Office and as a result they invest A LOT OF MONEY into the product, and well it shows.\n\nNext lets face the reality, Linux maintains a 2.94% market share of the Desktop Operating system marketshare...its tiny (although it used to be smaller)\n\nSo here's my idea\n\nSteam/Value have DONE AN AMAZING job with Proton. I can play games like GTAV, RDR2, War Thunder, MTW2, Etc, etc, etc. What if Microsoft went to them and said \"Hey, if you want to try and natively support Microsoft Office on Linux we will sign a licensing deal with you\"\n\nMicrosoft gives Steam/Value what they need to attempt the project. Obviously NDAs are going be involved cause I'm confident Microsoft does not want its source code in the open. If Steam/Value can come up with an acceptable solution they can retail it and Microsft gets a % of the sales.\n\nWhy do I target Value/Steam? Because they have already implemented a lot of software that used to be only able to \"natively\" run on Linux in a very seamless manner.\n\nBy natively I mean as close as possible, where all (or at least 99.9%) of them work flawlessly. \n\nAm I crazy?",

To my understanding, in the US ANSI keyboard (as opposed to the US ISO, or US International formats), there is a missing key at the right of the leftmost Shift key. That is *there is no key between the left Shift key and the letter \"Z\" in a US ANSI with a US layout printed on it*.\n\nSo in the German layout there is no key between the left shift and the \"Y\" keys, and in the Russian layout there is no key between the left shift and \"Я\" keys.\n\nThe missing key is usually used to insert the \"|\" I am looking for. In the case of the US layout (on the US ANSI keyboard), \"|\" can be inserted using shift + rightmost key at the top of the Enter's key.\n\nThe solutions I found  so far for the German layout is to insert the Unicode's code for the character \"|\", which is \"7C\", using Control + \"U\" + 7C. But I dont know how to do that in the Russian layout.\n\nSo how to insert a Unicode character in a Russian layout, and do you know of any other tips to insert the \"|\" character using a German or Russian layouts on my US ANSI keyboard?",

But now I will have 2 spare PCs, and I want to come back to Linux for these two. I feel I am a noob again since many things happened.\n\nLike by the past, I see a lot of super cool distros, but I always hate when I find a distro which is discontinued a few months or years later. So I would like to know with version is likely to stay in time. Of course I guess the main ones, but I am sure I miss a lot of infos.\n\nLately, I have been testing these distros and I enjoyed them: Zorin OS, Chalet OS, Puppy, Lubuntu.\n\nMy needs: can run on low-end, average PC. As out of the box as possible. People not used to IT/Linux will use these computers. Thank you :D",

I  assume this as a rare problem, but possibly very annoying, as there is  no way to set hertz on TTY screens, xrandr will complain there is no screen.

Could someone please add such a mechanism in the future?",

Possibly experiment with apache web server too, for fun.  Anyway I've been using Mint for quite a few years and though I'm no expert, I am more comfortable with its package manager so a debian based might be best.  Seems like debian dog linux isn't being supported anymore so I am not sure what is stable/ available?  Something with a minimal gui as I'm not 100% comfortable with terminal  for everything yet.",

The root image is a squashFS which dracut boots. (This is why the root may appear to be writable, as dracut is booting this the same way it would boot a LiveCD)\n\nWe use LVM for the disk layout, and then we use overlayfs to make persistent filesystems on /var. There is also a seperate LV for /home.\n\nCurrently it is in very early stages, but it is installable on UEFI systems with my very scuffed install script (I am genuinely sorry if you open that file and read the code). I would encourage you to try it out in a VM if you are interested.\n\nYou can install applications through Flatpak which will persist on boot. Please let me know how you find it, any critique is very much welcomed and appreciated!\n\nCurrently I'm working on writing an actual installer that isn't horrific and a way to use emerge (looking into systemd sysext for this, to layer packages).\n\nYou can find the website [here](https://xenia-group.gitlab.io/xeniaweb)!",

        "text": "First I want to clarify, that I am aware of the hatred of canonical and the forcing of snaps in many cases. I have been a linux user for more than 4 years on my main laptop, working with fedora until today in plasma with wayland, it is perfect and never gives me problems, I have also learned a lot.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, recently it occurred to me to dust off an almost obsolete computer that I had stored with windows 8.1. The support had ended but I was lazy to go deeper, however I changed your rtl8187b card for an intel 5100 agn, the laptop is a toshiba l515 (t4400-8 gb ddr3-ssd 240-intel gm45 graphics), when I made the change, windows it refused to recognize the card with driver error 10 refusing to launch it. I tried a lot of auto-detection tools and there was no case, moreover the toshiba page now dynabook, does not provide support, most of the drivers are down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWindows 10 the same, there was no other case it felt laggy for obvious reasons from my old hardware. I decided to install my beloved fedora, but it refused to start the live usb, it indicated various errors, but nevertheless xfce spin did work. I installed it and it was as laggy as win10, very clumsy for everything, I didn't understand what was happening... I installed plasma by terminal and removed xfce in groupinstall, plasma also felt clumsy and often grayed out loading. Finally I decided to delete everything and gave the opportunity to the prejudiced, criticized and hated unpopular ubuntu in its kubuntu plasma version. Everything works great, it's bullet fast and snappy, even faster than fedora xfce. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess it's all about proprietary drivers, but never mind. Wayland version of kubuntu 22.04 hasn't crashed once so far, the hardware was detected wonderfully and it's too easy to use in general, however I had some difficulties to install ksysguard for its backend for some widgets, but I managed it doing research. I guess if I ever need to switch other machines to linux, which I will do in the future, it will be kubuntu. On my main machine I will continue with fedora because I like it and I'm used to it, plus I need some rhel tools. Still, I have no doubt that kubuntu would work great here.",
