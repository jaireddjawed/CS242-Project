About five to seven thousand is the current estimate of their numbers in the wild and of these only about fifteen hundred are mature enough to breed. The odds are not good!\n\nYou can help support the awareness campaign - the dogs communicate over long distances by means of the [hoo call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVXF6v9Zc2A) \\- join in a human hoo call and tell the world that Painted Dog needs our support!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is what is already happening:\n\n* They will feature in the upcoming BBC series 'Dynasties' with Sir David Attenborough which is due to air in the UK this autumn and will undoubtedly reach a massive audience: [First look preview from BBC America](http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2018/08/first-look-dynasties-premieres-early-2019-on-bbc-america)\n* Nicholas Dyer is [NHM Photographer of the Year](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/photography-special-stunning-contenders-for-this-years-wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-awards-000l0l2gk) 2018 finalist with an image of two painted dogs.\n* Peter Blinston, executive director of [Painted Dog Conservation](https://www.painteddog.org/) and involved in Painted Dog conservation in the field for over twenty years has worked with Nick Dyer on a new book called Painted Wolves: A Wild Dog's Life which will raise funds for Painted Dog conservation groups.\n* A [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paintedwolf/painted-wolves-a-wild-dogs-life?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=painted%20wolves) to get the book published is being supported by a host of conservation charities whose efforts have been rewarded with a massive response.\n* A new reddit sub /r/PaintedWolves dedicated solely to raising awareness of the African Painted Dog and aiming to support the efforts of those directly involved.\n* Anecdotal evidence suggests that all the current efforts are beginning to have an effect - there seems to be an increase in the availability of merchandise featuring the dogs for example.\n\nWe would really appreciate your support - if everyone who reads this post just tells one other person that the African Painted Dog is a highly endangered species which needs urgent help then the ripples going outward from that stone thrown could go a long way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...and if you took the time to read all of the way through - Thank you :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: typo\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
