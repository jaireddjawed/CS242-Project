        "text": "Millions of people lurk reddit, but only a fraction of people comment, so reddit's collective education level is usually judged by its comments.\n\nReddit's own education level is insulted by other redditors all the time, but I don't think this is thought-through. I suspect it's in a \"ugh, these people are so dumb and I am so smart\" way, not in a \"redditors are actually dumb relative to the average\" way.\n\nI used to tutor English at a very average college. I also used to tutor the SAT. I have a strong grasp of what kind of writing errors the average person makes and what constitutes the average person's vocabulary. Average people tend to not understand transitions very well, and they don't use dependent clauses very much.\n\nTo make sure you understand how bad 'bad' can go, quoted below is worst essay I've ever received, copied verbatim. I don't remember their name, but I still have the essay. This was also over half a decade ago, so whoever wrote this is long-gone by now and has probably forgotten this assignment even existed.\n\nA native English-speaker at a college in the US wrote this. Not only is it real, it's something someone was going to turn in for a grade:\n\n&gt; This paragraph tell it all when black where free of salvery and in justice, it was the happyest day of every Negos life.\n\n&gt; But sadley in this paragraph we still have americans more like white, are still indenaly about black being Free, and discriminated , for example some country still don't acepted black in their White school, jobs. etc. lands , we have dishonor the law's of Constitution and the Delaration of Independence\n\n&gt; Because of this we are force them to Accepted WelFare checks, for food , lodge and a check for basic necessity , and also Medicated for their health . But Now that the money well is getting try out , now were talking about , let be fare , and help educated the black's and let them stand on their feet\n\n&gt; As Martin Luther King say must fight , with dignity and discipline, they must not allow white people to get angry enought to fight agasnt them. To get thins done just like white people with dignity and the white people will follow us ,because were protesting with repect and dignity.\n\n&gt; IN this paragraph you must never turn back, you march forward and fight to the end , and don't let the White stop us from beat down, unspeakable horrors they wont be satisfied until they have there freedome\n\nI'm not going to do several paragraphs, but an average person would write something like this:\n\n&gt; \"America has had lots of racism in the past. Martin Luther King was a battler of Racism. He was a good leader and he protested in his speech, \"I Have A Dream\". He was a really good speaker and he had good ideas. In my life, I find his work inspiring.\"\n\nKeep in mind that spellcheck cleans this stuff up. If you read it on the internet, you might get this:\n\n&gt; \"America has had lots of racism in the past. Martin Luthor King was a battlor of Racism. He was a good leader and he protested in his speech, \"I Have A Dream\". He was a really good speaker and he had good ideas. In my life, I find his work enspiring.\"\n\nA reddit commenter (very average, keep in mind, we are not talking about powerusers) might write this:\n\n&gt; Martin Luther King was the most important black leader, by far. His vision gave Americans a way to picture America without racism, while other leaders just focused on what was wrong with racism. His importance is irrefutable.\n\nA more advanced college student might write this (I purposely added a few clumsy trademarks of college paper-writing):\n\n&gt; While Martin Luther King's contributions to the advancement of black equality and erosion of white racism in America are inarguable, his foremost contribution is envisioning a post-racial America that led to the enactment of such a vision, as opposed to a pedagogical or rhetorical refutation of the status quo.\n\nThe third one is not just more pretentious than the second; it uses more precise language to describe what it's talking about. \"Foremost contribution\" actually prioritizes the weight of his contributions for example, as opposed to just saying \"he did this.\"\n\nYou can clearly note the distinctions as each example progresses a grade.\n\nThe vocabulary use on reddit is different also, but singling out specific examples makes most people think I'm saying \"knowing this word makes you smart\", and it doesn't. But, for example, \"jettisoned\" was a difficulty 4 (out of 5) word on the SAT, and the average test-taker (who is slightly above average, since only students who intend to go to college take the SAT) scores a smattering of difficulty 3 words right and that's it.\n\nNot knowing a certain word, in isolation, is no big deal. No one would say \"not knowing this word makes you dumb.\" But the SAT chooses the words they choose for a reason. They have a lot of people calibrating their data to see how predictive each question is. In other words, they want to test vocabulary that most indicates your knowledge of other vocabulary. So if you miss every word past a certain difficulty, that probably indicates what kind of stuff you've made a habit of reading, or at the very least how often you check the dictionary when you don't know a word.\n\nOn every subject I've seen redditors tackle, the average reddit commenter seems to be  above average. They aren't extremely smart, which is what I'd consider an MIT student, but they're not average and they're most certainly not *below average*.\n\nThis seems to be backed up by college subreddit population too: the most popular colleges on here are disproportionately colleges with 75th to 95th percentile scores. If college size were equal to subreddit college size, you'd see colleges like OSU topping subscriptions. Yet, OSU has 1.76x the student enrollment of UC berkeley and is only 0.71x the subreddit size of UC berkeley. Arizona State has 3,700 subscribers yet 38,500 enrolled undergraduates on the physical campus. Most colleges with \"tech\" in the name will disproportionately have more reddit users, also, for reasons we could suspect.\n\nFinally, most colleges now use online class management systems where professors can post grades and start discussions. This is, effectively, an internet forum you need to post on for a grade. I've had several classes that did this. But even though these comments are for a grade, they're far more stilted than reddit's -- these are people who are not used to putting their thoughts to text, so they use wordy stock phrases that no one would say in real life like \"my opinion on this topic is that...\"; if you have any older relatives who comment on facebook, you probably know what I am talking about.\n\nSo this doesn't really give us an idea of how smart the average reddit subscriber is, but it strongly points the direction toward \"markedly above average\", which I think being in the top quarter of students is.\n\n---\n\n#**To the actual question:**\n\nI've spent most of my time on the previous point because I think that is the point most people will dispute. But why?\n\nI have had so many people rage at me when I say redditors are decisively above average, yet prior to these reactions I had thought it was an uncontroversial thing to say.\n\nSaying that redditors are average seems to be at least one of the following:\n\n1. overvaluing the competence of average person, or:\n2. undervaluing the competence of redditors, or:\n3. defining \"average\" inaccurately, e.g. pegged to your circle of friends (who are themselves strongly above average)\n\nMost reddit commenters are introverted, and most introverted people I know hang out with a small circle of friends, so it's possible that people don't have a very good metric for 'average' and use their friends as a basis for comparison. I've noticed this effect in the gym; lifters cannot believe that 203lb is a 95th percentile bench press among men under 30, but it [probably is](http://www.sfu.ca/~leyland/Kin143%20Files/Muscular%20Strength%20Testing.pdf), especially considering only 15% of Americans have a gym membership and 66% stop attending after a few months.\n\nFor what it's worth, here is my perspective: I've been to at least three different schools for each sequence of school (primary/secondary/postsecondary) and have never stayed at a single school for more than three years, though many for just a year, and these schools have varied widely in competence. I've been to a community college for miscellaneous courses, a college that admitted the top 7% (or so) of students, and a college that was decisively average but across the street from the top 7%, which I went to after the tuition at the top 7% one spiked by an inordinate amount. Students at the 7% college were required to live on campus for three years of their education (I was exempt from this for financial reasons.) A lot of the students did not know the surrounding city very well or even have a sense for what regular people thought, and these people were, I'd imagine, more extroverted than the average reddit commenter.\n\nThere's another possibility that might be true, though I'm not sure how many people could think this way: the kind of commenter who insults reddit commenters collectively has some kind of spiteful sense of superiority combined with an inaccurate perception of the average person, so they're willing to believe that reddit commenters are average because they know this would bother the average reddit commenter.\n\nAnyway, I have nothing conclusive to say about this, but I strongly doubt the average reddit commenter is average, so tell me what you think and why.",

Example choices of invitation criteria:\n\n1. Age. All participants must be 25 or older. This is just a rationalization of research by the MIT Young Adult Development Project: \n&gt; According to recent findings, the human brain does not reach full maturity until at least the mid-20s. (See J. Giedd in References.) The specific changes that follow young adulthood are not yet well studied, but it is known that they involve increased myelination and continued adding and pruning of neurons. As a number of researchers have put it, \"the rental car companies have it right.\" The brain isn't fully mature at 16, when we are allowed to drive, or at 18, when we are allowed to vote, or at 21, when we are allowed to drink, **but closer to 25**, when we are allowed to rent a car.\n\n2. Network/relation based. Invitations must be endorsed/recommended by minimum of three current members, of the invitee's choice. Basically pm them and have them get to know one another before admission.\n\nUnlike private subs, these would be open for viewing, just not for random commenting. This way redditors can gauge their own interest in participating.\n\nWe've often heard of the Ultimate Solution to reddit's problems, namely \"Go make your own subreddit\". So perhaps criteria such as these two are tools for creating the various communities that each of us wants to see.\n\nBut I emphasize this is all half-baked thinking at the end of a slightly sleep-deprived day.

Maybe the people who are blatantly racist, swear at people unnecessarily, and produce low-effort content are not simply dumb adults, but kids with little impulse control or maturity and much to learn about the world.\n\nI realized that because 99.9% of the people I interact with in 2015 are over 24 or so, I seem to generalize that everyone on reddit is just like me, insofar as being an adult.\n\nHow did you interact with others over the Internet as a kid?

        "text": "Skip to the TL:DR if you want, but at least hear this out first: I know these questions seem like they're circling the corpse of a beaten horse that already answered them, but the difference in what I'm asking hasn't been answered (or asked) as far as I can tell. So I'm hoping someone with a serious opinion/reddit background will read this long enough to either 1. point me towards a discussion on this topic which I clearly missed in my search, or 2. thoughtfully share their insight on these two related questions, whether they disagree with me or not.\n\nQuestion #1: So the more obvious question is related to why people downvote, and I know that's been discussed plenty. My specific question, which I think is different, is why do people choose to downvote the more harmless content that meets reddiquette criteria (original, in the right sub, etc) instead of ignoring it entirely? What is the value of downvoting a post that's hovering at a few points and nowhere near the front page or ever getting more hype than it deserves? If the original poster is well intended and not notoriously obnoxious, a downvote can have a larger impact on their karma than it would on a high-traffic account. What's the harm in leaving it alone in case someone else enjoys it? What's the benefit of banishing it? Does anyone else notice this becoming more prevalent? \n\nQuestion #2: BUT the question I'm much more interested in is whether or not people believe their upvote to be \"worth\" more than someone else's? Does this explain why some people are so frugal with their upvotes? Because I constantly see big proclamations from someone about \"giving\" their upvote to someone, and I think, \"okay, if we acknowledge that an upvote is given with serious consideration, and that an upvote must stringently meet the reddiquette criteria, then shouldn't the same be true for a downvote?\" And yet it seems more and more people downvote without hesitation content that others might find amusing, even though mods remind us time and time again that \"a downvote is not a 'disagree' button.\" \n\nWhy do I think it matters?: No, I'm not asking because I think my posts are the greatest and no one else agrees with me. I'm asking as someone who has long watched Reddit from the outside in from a unique vantage point, and I'm genuinely curious how the hive-mind can justify the following: Inevitably casual redditors (who submit infrequently because they also care about preserving Reddit and not letting it become overpopulated with junk, as the serious redditors claim to care about) leave this site in favor of more innovative, unpolluted hubs. And then those hubs last a little while before they meet the same fate. Some of the best users aren't the accounts who seem to make a career out of their karma, and yet the ones who take Reddit the most seriously seem to drive them away.\n\nIs there now an algorithm that makes one user's upvote worth less depending on how often they hand them out? Is there an unspoken code that this is true even though we can't see where specific upvotes and downvotes come from? I just don't get how the same people worried about losing Reddit to the unwashed masses ala youtube are often the same people who counter-intuitively downvote decent content from decent users - and fail to see how THAT is depleting some of Reddit's original virtues.\n\nLastly,  this is probably another post for another day, although it seems slightly related, but the inclination to upvote and downvote based on who the original poster is (and whether that user is established/well-liked, or famous, or new, or disliked) seems to be defeating any chance Reddit has of surviving a transformation it fears. If this is supposed to be a place for funny, thoughtful, intelligent content/conversation that is the anti-youtube-comment-section, I suppose closing off new users is certainly easier than filtering new content AND reviewing longtime users thoughtfully, but it doesn't keep Reddit fresh and original and \"better\" than the sites it strives not to be. It just makes popular Redditors look like the kid in high school who always talked about what he learned from the extra-credit course he took at the community ~college~, and all of the other Redditors who blindly follow look like the lackies who desperately followed the cool kids around the school for fear of being otherwise ostracized.\n\nTL:DR:\n#1: Why do people downvote without a second thought instead of ignoring entirely a post they're not into (so long as the post otherwise meets Reddiquette)?\n#2: Why don't people follow the same generous rule of thumb with upvotes, but rather treat them as though each one \"costs\" them something?\n\n",

The link is, indeed, about the Armenian Genocide, not that any of the child comments comment on it.\n\nWhy does this thread seek so hard to talk about everything *other* than the topic?\n\nI make no claims about the veracity of the posts in the thread I reference, and simply take their claims and wording at face value here. I've code-tagged the comment descriptions for brevity, but they are important.\n\n    The top comment references the English genocide in Bengal, 1943-1945. 135 points.\n    \n    The next comment references Native Americans, the Irish genocide, and Indians. 81 points.\n    \n    The third comment is (presumably) by a Turk, saying he thinks it was a genocide too, so don't generalize. 42 points.\n    \n    The fourth comment talks about the Native American genocide and the Vietnamese genocide (?). 31 points.\n    \n    The fifth comment disputes 'the first genocide' and points to German and Belgian atrocities in Africa. 26 points.\n    \n    The sixth comment argues that the slaughter of Armenians was not *legally* a genocide (essentially the Turkish government's position nowadays). 19 points.\n    \n    The seventh comment... I'm not sure what the point is, but I assume it's supposed to be relevant. 13 points, controversial.\n    \n    The eighth comment, an Armenian explaining why the Armenian genocide doesn't matter to her/him. 8 points.\n    \n    Finally, the OP with a relevant submission statement, at 8 points.\n\nSo here's what I'm trying to understand.\n\nThe Armenian Genocide has been in the news lately. It hits what I thought was reddit's core audience - young, connected, aware people who pay attention to national and world news. That's certainly what I'd expect /r/TrueReddit's audience to be. I'd expect /r/TrueReddit's readership to be more aware than the general reddit population of both the Armenian Genocide and today's significance, much less the general population.\n\nSo what's going on here? I'd like some help from y'all, though I do have a couple of theories:\n\n1. reddit's well-known proclivity for second opinion bias. The Armenian Genocide is all over the news; by second opinion bias, that must mean that not only is it unimportant because it is popular, there must be other things out there that are more important. The Armenian Genocide is relatively unimportant.\n2. The subscribers of /r/TrueReddit are using the Armenian Genocide as a backboard for their own grievances regarding other governments' failure to recognize genocides. The Armenian Genocide is assumed to be important.\n3. The Turkish government is notably against the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The Turkish government actively takes measures against such recognition. The Turkish government is active on social media, and is manipulating reddit to make posts favoring its view more visible.\n\nI'd really like to discard the third, and talk Theory of Reddit rather than Theory of Reddit Manipulation, but the distribution of comments in the voting hierarchy on this topic seems... just wrong to me, as a regular /r/TrueReddit subscriber and reader for more than two years. /r/TrueReddit typically likes comments that are germane to the linked article; it's actually gotten better lately about that. It may upvote one or *maybe* two comments that springboard off the linked article's concern, but doesn't typically vote such that only two of the top eight comments are even relevant.\n\nBut perhaps there's something else going on here? I don't know. Halp?",

These posts always seem to have a decent number of upvotes.\n\nWhile I'm not saying it's impossible for the NSA to do that, there hasn't been any evidence at all of it ever occurring. Yet by the time the circlejerk is over, it's like people have not only imagined this scenario, but have then conviced themselves that it's actually happening. \n\nAnother one is the idea that there's an epidemic of men being put on sex offender registries for public urination. Now while that actually does occasionally happen, it's very rare. I remember someone actually did the math and found that out of the thousands upon thousands of sex offenders in the US, there were I think only a few dozen there for public urination. Yet every time the sex offender registry gets brought up, people blow this way out of proportion to try to discredit the system.\n\nThis cynicism is something that I really only see on Reddit. While people in the real world may not like the NSA domestic spying programs, I've never heard the extreme rhetoric that I've heard on here. Only on reddit have I heard people call to completely abolish the NSA (bad idea) or even overthrow the government (wtf).\n\nWhat do you think causes this sort of thinking here?\n\n\n",

        "text": "I finished a dissertation on Facebook, reddit, and 4chan back in 2012, and I've been publishing [bits](http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=720) and [pieces](http://firstmonday.org/article/view/4825/3823) of it since.  My paper on reddit, called \"Karmic Cascades: Ranking Content and Conditioning Thought on reddit.com,\" came out a couple of weeks ago, and you can find it [here](http://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=techne&amp;id=techne_2015_0999_4_2_28).  Unlike the other two articles, it's unfortunately locked behind a journal paywall, meaning that you'll only be able to get free access to the full text if you're at a university.  Still, I thought I'd at least give out the link and give a quick overview of my argument.\n\nFirst, the abstract:\n\n&gt; The content ranking system of reddit.com, the English language Internet’s most popular social news website, plays a large but often unnoticed role in shaping what users see and how they think. By pairing informational cascade theory with textual analysis, I argue that the “karma” system elevates particular forms of content over others and generates numerical cues that unconsciously guide users’ judgments about said content and about the world. By drawing on Heidegger’s account of modern technology, I argue that the karma system both symptomatizes and engenders an ontological perspective according to which things in general are taken as available, evaluable, and disposable.\n\nIf karma is a system-generated cue that guides redditors' thoughts, and if evaluation systems like karma are being used across the net and beyond, then it's important to think through karma's mechanical idiosyncrasies and its political implications.  After reviewing the literature on system-generated cues, which mostly employs a social scientific lens, I switch to a more philosophical perspective, arguing that karma conditions a particular way of thinking about the world:\n\n&gt; [T]he broadest “effects” of impersonal, non-verbal, system-generated cues are not simply effects; instead, they involve an epistemological pattern of thinking or, more profoundly, an ontological pre-understanding of the world that itself acts as a condition of possibility for further mediation. This means that such cues cannot be studied without reference to this frame of reference. This pre-understanding necessarily excludes entire other modes of thinking and being, particularly non-Western ones. Reddit’s karma system, then, should be understood not only in terms of how it conditions interpretation and action here and now, but also in terms of how it symptomatizes and conditions a particular (understanding of) world. System-generated cues like the karma system should be understood in this broader politico-ontological context.\n\nI go on to talk about karma in the context of Martin Heidegger's analysis of technology, arguing that most reddit posts (and possible most things online) stand in reserve, waiting at users' disposal.  Links are there to be read, evaluated, and forgotten.  I pair Heidegger with an analysis of karma-as-informational-cascade, rubbing continental philosophy up against rational choice theory in order to describe the significance of the general feeling of rationality that many redditors exhibit.  Upvotes are more than just upvotes:\n\n&gt; [T]hey are expressions of assent and declarations of truth as well, and thus expressions of the notion that the world is comprised of things whose truthfulness can be discerned, adjudicated, and communicated.\n\nI conclude by quoting from Kierkegaard's *The Present Age*, arguing that his description of \"the public\" doesn't quite fit reddit:\n\n&gt; If I tried to imagine the public as a particular person . . . I should perhaps think of one of the Roman emperors, a large well-fed figure, suffering from boredom, looking only for the sensual intoxication of laughter. . . . He wanders about, indolent rather than bad, but with a negative desire to dominate. Every one . . . knows how many things a Caesar could try out in order to kill time. In the same way the public keeps a dog to amuse it. That dog is the sum of the literary world. If there is someone superior to the rest, perhaps even a great man, the dog is set on him and the fun begins. The dog goes for him, snapping and tearing at his coat-tails, allowing itself every possible ill-mannered familiarity—until the public tires, and says it may stop. That is an example of how the public levels. Their betters and superiors in strength are mishandled—and the dog remains a dog which even the public despises. The levelling is therefore done by a third party; a nonexistent public levelling with the help of a third party which in its insignificance is less than nothing.\n\nI adore Kierkegaard, and this description comes close to accounting for the *ressentiment* that redditors sometimes display, but it doesn't get at the low level enthusiasm of upvoting, the drive to archive, or the generalized sensation of rationality that pervades the site:\n\n&gt; Where [things in general] are evaluated according to a binary voting system such as reddit’s, the demand is not one that issues in use, but in archivization: from a particular frame of mind, the things of the world are valuable insofar as they can be accessed, assessed, and abandoned. What’s more, the seeming rationality of this framework—the *impression* of rationality that karmic cascades induce—legitimizes this perspective. The internal consensus reached in all echo chambers might produce a sensation of correctness, but the particular consensus reached on reddit is loaned visual, numerical legitimization by the karma system.\n\nThere's more to the argument than that, but I don't want to go on much longer.  Hopefully some of you are sitting on library computers at the moment...\n\nEdit to add: I can email a pre-publication, draft version of the paper to anyone who's interested - just not the final version - so if you want to take a look at the full paper but don't have access to the journal, PM me your email address.",

The comments were NOTHING but jokes made at the expense of the schizophrenic/mentally ill community as a whole. Like I said: I think it's too easy to say the first derogatory thing that comes to mind and call it a joke, because everybody knows how not-PC it is. The problem comes from building an us vs them mentality, and victimizing the \"crazy people.\" \n\nThis is a problem I've found across Reddit. If I see a science-related thread with misinformation in the title, I can be sure that the top comment will almost certainly be discounting it and explaining why it's false. This is not the case when it comes to mental health. This thread made it pretty clear to me that Reddit largely still sees schizophrenics as crazies, as non-people that just want to fling their feces at the wall. \n\n\nThat being said, there are usually posts of people that are trying to give information/stop the spread of misinformation, but very rarely are they given enough visibility to really matter; even a post with 200 upvotes is meager when the top posts are almost at 4000.

This phrase can and is used in practically any situation in which a reddit user takes the side of someone who is not a young white male, especially if that person has identified that they themselves are a young white male. For instance, if a straight guy takes the side of a gay guy, or a white guy takes the side of a black guy, or a male takes the side of a female.\n\nIt's implied in the phrase itself: White knight = white male (although it is used sometimes to describe someone who is neither white or male, it's pretty rare).\n\nI'm sure there are many examples of when this phrase is used that the \"white knight\" really is just trying to impress someone, however by-and-large I see it used as a catch-all pejorative anytime someone (particularly a white man) expresses that they sympathize with the issues of someone who is not a white man, and I wonder if this comes from reddit's brogressiveness: the brogressives of reddit only care about issues which pertain to young white men and so they cannot understand why someone from their own group of people (young white men) would care about issues that don't pertain to themselves. The only reason that they could see themselves doing this for others is if they were trying to impress other people.\n\nEDIT: Forgive the grammar error in the title.",

This question is going to take some explaining, so bear with me.\n\nAnyway, if you're unfamiliar with the button, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/31ltqd/read_this_before_you_press_the_official/) for a primer on how it works. I've been analyzing data of the button presses, specifically looking at how low the timer gets as a function of time, since everyone there is interested when the timer will finally reach zero. [Here's an example plot from last week](http://i.imgur.com/CjNNirY.png). The orange curve is the minimum timer value within a five minute window, and the blue dots are individual button presses. The blue dots look like horizontal lines because there are so many of them.\n\nWhen I first posted this, /u/gooddarts pointed out in a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/31vfen/statistical_analysis_of_the_last_72_hours_worth/cq5x707) that these curves are strongly correlated with traffic statistics from /r/thebutton, which are located [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheButton/about/traffic). He or she created [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/uwcoXm1.png) which shows the correlation.\n\nWhile this is fascinating in its own right, I'm more interested in activity that occurred Sunday night around 02:00 EDT. There was a large surge in button presses at this point, and I think it's especially interesting because **the increase in activity was not correlated with the traffic statistics**.\n\n[Here's the plot with traffic statistics from /r/thebutton overlaid on the raw data.](http://i.imgur.com/Zpaotd6.png)\n\nThe red arrow points to the large increase in activity. With the exception of this peak, there is still a strong correlation with the traffic data. My question is, what caused this? One suggestion for the increased activity was [an article about the button hitting the top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9365877). It seems plausible that someone there with access to a large amount of alt accounts could have used a bot to have them all click the button at the same time. Is this possible without it showing up in the traffic data? Could it have happened so fast that it was simply missed by the traffic statistics? \n\nI don't really know how the bots would work but it seems to me that something controlling a bunch of reddit accounts would still be defined as \"uniques\" by that traffic site, since it claims the uniques are counted by a combination of IP address and the user account. \n\nThe alternative is that these data sets aren't especially correlated, and I just found one of many outliers. However, I don't think that's the case given how strong the correlation is at the other times. Anyone have a good theory?\n",

(Yes I'm aware you can hide them or make your likes not viewable to public but they're still there and you're not able to change that fact, and I'm also aware why posts are archived but they should be able to remove the post from ones profile, in the same way that if you delete an account the posts will stay up but the username that posted it will say deleted) Xbox, League of Legends, Runescape, just to name a couple services that charged money or a form a currency to be able to change your username but at least they gave you the option. Another example is Minecraft, they now allow you to change your username but set a 30 day waiting period if you want to do it again, it isn't as easier as Twitter where you can change it as many time as you want but still, it gives the user the option to change it if want to do so. When I signed up for Reddit I was unaware you couldn't change your username, which doesn't bother me personally (Yes it would be nice to but I can get past it) , I dislike the fact that I cant remove things from my overview, but I can see others are bothered with the username problem, especially if they have accumulated a decent amount of karma on their account. These are just some of the things I would look for in a \"premium\" service of an account. I think matters such as improving the user experience in a website are more important than adding avatars (Snoovatars) that you can design. With the current \"benefits\" of the gold service I can't see myself ever signing up for gold.",

Reddit as a whole recognizes it's participation and discusses it with an air of regret; FindBostonBombers often shows up in \"what is the worst thing reddit ever did?\" threads, for example.\n\nReddit during the event is the largest scale example of the mob rule and journalism coming together like this, and it's no question that people both on and off reddit need to know the risks of social media involvement in reporting and news. But is this something reddit as a platform is responsible for by design? Are there worse examples if on a smaller scale, from reddit or even other sites?\n\nThe documentary should be out very soon today. I'll post up a link when I find one and would love to hear your opinions on it.\n\nEDIT: Quick update; all two articles discussing this documentary state that it will come out on the 13th, but it's solidly the 14th now and it isn't out yet. The IMDB page updated so it might just be a technical delay; will provide links when available.\n\nEDIT 2: The closest thing to an actual hint that the video exists! Content Media Productions has a link to it on its channel...however, seems that the video isn't available to be viewed at this time. It will cost some amount of money to view, but I'm unfamiliar with how YouTube runs these sort of movies. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHCYYLyyBrg",

        "text": "\"A more important finding from the work on Solenopsis saevissima involves the way in which mass communication is achieved.  By mass communication I mean information that can be transmitted only from one group of individuals to another group of individuals.  In the case of S. saevissima, the number of workers leaving the nest is controlled by the amount of trail substance being emitted by foragers already in the field.  Tests involving the use of enriched trail pheromone showed that the number of individuals drawn outside the nest is a linear function of the amount of the substance presented to the colony as a whole.  Under natural conditions this quantitative relation results in the adjustment oft he outflow of workers to the level needed at the food source.  An equilibration is then achieved in the following manner.  The initial buildup of workers at a newly discovered food source is exponential, and it decelerates toward a limit as workers become crowded on the food mass because workers unable to reach the mass turn back without laying trails and because trail deposits made by single workers evaporate within a few minutes.  As a result, the number of workers at  food masses tends to stabilize at a level which is a linear function of the area of the food mass.  Sometimes, for example when the food find is of poor quality or far away or when the colony is already well fed, the workers do not cover it entirely, but equilibrate at a lower density.  This mass communciation of quality is achieved by means of an \"electorate\" response, in which individuals choose whether to lay trails after inspecting the food find. \"-Edward O Wilson, The Insect Societies, p253.\n\n&gt; Isn't this...exactly how reddit works?  Think about it: it's a linear response where each user gives a trail (upvote) or no trail (nothing) (and ants can also lay 'negative' attractive scents in a similar method to a downvote)...the point here being that what makes these trails a 'mass communication' is that workers use the ratio of different concentrations, layered upon by many scores of their bretheren, to determine action in a similar way that we use to click on links that have +5000 or +125 rating.  Similarly, reddit has an 'evaporation' of 'hotness' in quite probably exactly the same kind of exponential backoff, and artifacts that we encounter tend to have cultural currency that limits the amount of 'trails' we end up leaving.  And similar to ants, a single individual ant may leave one trail, whereas the hive ends up sending many such ants.\n\n&gt; Don't get distracted by the fact that it's a chemical being layed: chemicals are the primary media of communication of ants, and ants capability of understanding content of a message is best when the message is transmitted via means of chemical/scent means(same book describes in great length how this is so).\n\n&gt; **tl;dr** [ants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenopsis_saevissima) use a reddit-like way of scoring *their* information environment, only instead of looking for and exhausting cultural artifacts they look for food.",

Usually in subs that feature videos or GIFs, you have a handful of comments giving a log of when the item was previously posted and a note of their disapproval.

(Our paper, titled \"All Who Wander: On the Prevalence and Characteristics of Multi-community Engagement\", will be presented in a conference on World Wide Web, [WWW2015](http://www2015.it/) in May.)\n\nWe are interested in how a person engages with multiple communities. For example, how do people choose new communities to join? Do people settle down in several communities after a while or keep exploring? Traditional biography studies suggest that people usually settle down after an exploration period in adolescent years. In order to understand such problems in an online setting, we conducted a longitudinal study on redditors who started before 2012 and had posted at 50 posts until January, 2014.\n\n**Summary of our findings** \n[a very quick overview of the research through a [picture](https://chenhaot.com/pubs/multi-community-poster.jpg)]\n\n1. It is prevalent that redditors in our data continue to seek out new and different communities (In our setting, communities=subreddits).\n\n2. They tend to move to smaller and more different communities; they tend to post more evenly across different subreddits; they continually adapt their language to the community language; they get more positive feedback over time.\n(Feedback is measured by the difference between upvotes and downvotes.)\n\n3. Interestingly, users, who ended up abandoning Reddit as a whole, \"wander\" less than users who stayed active. They explore a lot less from very early on in their reddit life. As a result, we can predict whether a user is going to abandon Reddit in the future based on how she/he engages with multiple subreddits from the very beginning.\n\n4. Even from how a redditor use common words (e.g., you, i, is, a, on, of), we can tell which subreddit she/he posted to.\n\n5. Redditors are more likely to stop posting in subreddits where they get bad initial feedback.\n\n6. But of course there are many aspects that we did not have time, data or capacity of investigate!\n\nMore details of our study is in our [paper](https://chenhaot.com/pages/multi-community.html). \n\n\n**Your comment is highly appreciated!**\nIn making this post, we hope to learn what you think about multi-community engagement. If you have any thoughts or feedback on our findings or the following questions, please comment here or email us at  chenhao [at] cs.cornell.edu .\n(Although our study was focused on posting behavior partly because it is difficult to collect all the comments on reddit, we would like comments from all redditors. It would be nice if you tell us whether you tend to comment or post more.)\n\n1. Do you feel that you are exploring new subreddits or new communities?\n1a. If so, do you have a conscious strategy to explore or does it just happen naturally?\n2. Why do you post or comment in a new subreddit?\n3. What are the usual ways that you find out new subreddits?\n4. Why do you stop posting or commenting in a subreddit?\n5. How do you find your experience of integrating into a new subreddit after you have been to many subreddits?\n6. What is your most notable experience in changing the way that you speak across different subreddits, or do you think that you do not adjust your language for different subreddits?",
