I found biology interesting and did decent in it in high school (B grade), but was never in any clubs or organizations for it. I don't know if that has any bearing on my decision. I find science pretty interesting, and I'm decent at math. Chemistry was ok for me, I had to work really hard just for a B though. I wouldn't say science is my passion, but to be honest I don't really have any passions right now. Science does interest me and I love certain aspects of it. I know it will be lots of biology and chemistry, plus math. I would want to go into health sciences with a biology major, or maybe even teaching. I'm not too sure and just need some help. TIA.",

        "text": "Hey\n\nI would really need some help in explaining polyploidy. In my textbooks, they use these examples of autopolyploidy and allopolyploidy: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Autopolyploidy](https://preview.redd.it/zeuvsb412lba1.jpg?width=529&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e7e41409cbefb4684d4360cff7b857a6f669e5d0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Allopolyploidy](https://preview.redd.it/dh2kmz742lba1.jpg?width=1202&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ec7c0ad4adba9ad9bda6e071d056340f0df1b6fc)\n\nAs you can see, they use n (4n=12 etc), but then my teacher said something about it being more correct to use x instead (4x=12). I've tried to understand what the difference between x and n is, but I can't wrap my head around it. I know that n=the number of chromosomes in a gamete, therefore, in the picture of allopolyploidy (second picture), n=6. And if n=6, 4n can't be equal to 12. But then, I've have interpreted the number infront of x as how many sets there are of each chromosome, like if there are 42 chromosomes in total, and there are 7 different types of chromosomes and 6 homologous chromosomes of each type, 6x=42. That logic would work with their example of autopolyploidy (first picture), that 4x=8, because it has 4 homologous chromosomes of each type. But in the example of allopolyploidy (second picture) it only has 2 homologous chromosomes of each type (2 A, 2 B etc). So then, if it is correct to use 4x=12, then the number infront of x does not equal the number of sets of chromosomes? \n\nTo sum it up: \n\nFirstly, what is more correct, 4x=8 and 4x=12, or 4n=8 and 4n=12? \n\nSecondly, what does x (and the number infront of it) mean?\n\nAnd thirdly, (maybe it is explained in the other two questions), what makes the example of allopolyploidy polyploidy, since it does not have more than two homologous chromosomes of each type, compared to the example of autopolyploidy where it actually has more than 2 sets of each chromosome. \n\n(Also, excuse any typos, English is not my first language, but I hope it's comprehensible :) )",

So far it's fun and I like the instructor, who of which has a degree in paleontology. Today however, we got into an argument about whether or not dinosaurs were reptiles? \n\nHe claims that they're not, and that instead they're too distinct from other reptiles and are thus considered a seperate group (this applies to pterosaurs also). I brought up the fact that dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and crocodilians are all descended from archosaurs which are true reptiles, thus all 3 are true reptiles. His response was just \"that's not how phylogeny works\". \n\nHe then drew a chart on the board of a phylogenetic tree showing many different lineages of reptiles and other animals. He then drew a box around the dinosaurs and pterosaurs and again claimed that they were simply told distinct to be reptiles. Not only that, but also that they simply shared a common ancestor with reptiles. On this chart, he put crocodilians very close to lizards which I don't believe is accurate. It seems that most experts I find online are on my side, tho I have seen some push back. Am I in the wrong here?",

In my recent experiment I set up a reactor to imitate a river (sediment, water and a slow rotator). I am adding NO3- and PO4- on a weekly basis, as well as measuring O2, TOC, TN, NH4+ and NO2- in the water. Now the main focus is the development of antibiotics resistant genes, that's why I am also adding antibiotics on a weekly basis, meaning a carbon and nitrogen source.\n\nLooking at the data, I can see a clear decline in NO3- and O2 after the addition of antibitiotics. Also the TOC is rising while the O2 is at its lowest. Does this mean anaerobic bacteria is growing and consuming nutrients or mainly aerobic? Is the process of nitrification more dominant oder dentrification?\n\nI hope this makes sense and some of you might be able to give me some advice. If you need any further information, just let me know!\n\nI also added some of my graphs - they are in german, but I think you can still clearly see which is which :)\n\n[nitrate and phosphat \\(time in weeks\\)](https://preview.redd.it/pxbuplz1chba1.png?width=1973&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d68535995ef80d13a8dd0f408ce60624c3844144)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[from left to right: pH, oxygen, nh4+, no2-, totaly and dissolved organic carbon.](https://preview.redd.it/gqfyj7urbhba1.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=59536f97ef84e6ed5e304f9aa32e2fc84dfac534)\n\nThanks in advance.",

Eggcells are formed from undifferentiated stem cells called oogonia. During the development of the fetus in the womb - those oogonias divide by mitosis - and becomes primary oocytes.\n\nB. In week 8 or 9 mitosis stops slowly and starts the first meiosis division. This division pauses at prophase I and is not completed until the child has hit puberty and starts ovulating.\n\nC. Each month 5-10 of the paused primary oocytes start maturing in the ovary. Only one completes meiosis I. It has 23 chromosomes and is a secondary oocyte. THEN - is starts meiosis II until metaphase II where it pauses until fertalization. \n\nD. The primary oocyte is transported into the fallopian tube. Only if fertilized it can complete meiosis II. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1) Is all this correct?\n\n2) Do we know exactly when A happens?

I just got a grant for my masters so, even though I prefer them to be free, I can also pay if needed (language preferably English or Spanish).\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n1- A general course about python (and/or R) to familiarize with it so I can better follow the following courses.\n\n2- Bioinformatics applications of Python (and/or R) (**The problem I've been finding is that most university level bioinformatic courses are focused in genomics, and I'm interested in finding courses more focused on protein structure and protein design for protein egineering**).\n\n3- Courses about specific softwares for protein structure/Design/engineering such as Rosetta (or MOE).\n\nThanks in advance, and sorry if this is not meant to be here, but I didn't know where to ask. I'm quite lost.",

My study will investigate the anxiolytic effect of a drug on zebrafish predator avoidance by conducting a predator avoidance test (protocol described by Audira et al). This test involves putting the zebrafish and a predator fish stimulus (e.g. cichlid) separately in a two-compartment tank. The level of predator avoidance will be determined by several parameters such as distance from the glass separator, average speed, etc. However, the problem is that the zebrafish are naive to predators. And my panelists raised the possibility that the behavior of the zebrafish will be due to other factors such as stress and neophobia, instead of fear of predators. How can I quickly train the zebrafish to fear the predator in shortest time possible? I would love to hear your answers.",

I am coming from a middle class family in a developing country. I want to choose a career that offers me better financial stability. Also I think PhD might not suit my lifestyle as it requires a lot of commitment and sacrifice. \n\nMasters to PhD always seemed like a natural progression for me and I have wanted to stay in academia. I like science and I love doing science. But I feel like my mental health is plunging because of long working hours and having to work even on the weekends (even on New year's :(, this is because of the model system and the nature of the research question). I am currently applying for PhD but I would like to know my options if not PhD. I am also looking forward for roles abroad preferably Europe. \n\nFor more context I am a masters student in biology, I have had experience working with mouse model systems and perform confocal imaging on a day to day basis. I have done basic molecular experiments as per my lab course, but would need some more practice. I also have managed international collaborations and have organised a bunch of events in my uni.\n\nI am considering jobs as Research assistant for now. I have heard of other fields such as project management and science communication. But I do not know how or where to start. What are the other roles that I can look into? Have you gone through a similar experience and what did you do? And how and where do i start looking for opportunities? What additional skillsets or qualifications do I need?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",
