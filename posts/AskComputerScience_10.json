Ideally, I'd like to learn everything that would be reasonably taught in an undergraduate, first course on relational databases.\n\nI found the udacity course \"Intro to Relational Databases\", as well as a variety of books on Amazon, but I'd like to hear recommendations from people who have perhaps used these resources before, or know people that have and can give some informed input. I'd prefer resources in text format since I learn a lot better if I read something, but I'm open to anything.\n\nAdditionally, if the resource(s) covers the basics of SQL that would be a big bonus, although I assume learning SQL itself is fairly easy so it's far from mandatory.",

        "text": "I'm a senior Computer and Electrical Engineering major at a state university, so I feel like I'm a *fairly* experienced programmer, having done well in all of my software engineering classes and successfully completed some of my own creative projects. But I've got a design problem I'm trying to overcome and I'd like to know what those who have infinitely more experience at these things think about it.\n\nSo, I'm creating an RPG battle system using Java. Characters are able to equip weapons, armor. This is where it gets tricky for me: I don't want the weapons or the armor to have any inherent attack or defense power, but instead, I want the attributes of the character wielding said weapon or armor to determine how effective they are at using those weapons. \n\nFor example, in many RPG's, a weapon such as a sword will have an attack power of say, 25. This number is then scaled in some way with the character's strength to provide a final calculated attack power of that character when they are wielding the sword. I don't want this.\n\nInstead, I want characters who are effective at *wielding* swords to struggle using something like, say, a staff or a knife. In essence, I want the character's attributes to determine what weapons they would wield most effectively, and not the other way around. A powerful sword would only be powerful if the character was good at using swords in the first place.\n\nTo me, this presents a problem concerning aggregation. The *Weapon* or *Armor* classes don't have access to the fields of the *Hero* class. In this way, it's impossible to write methods in the *Weapon* or *Armor* classes that calculate what kind of damage they could do, since the damage is entirely dependent on what attributes the *Hero* possesses.  In essence, I can't write anything concerning the behavior of weapons or armor within their respective classes since their efficacy is entirely dependent on the hero who is using them.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The existing extensions for both browsers work in older versions but it is very clear they no longer work in current versions of the browser in spite of the extensions being updated.\n\nDisclaimer: I don’t have a computer science background but I’ll do my best to follow along with any technical explanation someone can give\n\nHi guys,\n\nI come from a country with really slow internet and one of my biggest gripes is downloading really large files over my browser. When I have to download something that’s bigger than 2 GBs I end up leaving it on overnight and hoping the download completes the next day. In many cases, I wake up to find the download cancelled at some point in the night.\n\nFed up, I searched for solutions that would auto-resume failed downloads I left on overnight. I was surprised that such a seemingly simple function is not readily offered by any extension or built-in to a browser. I would think this is something people would need.\n\nThe solution I ended up using was a bit roundabout - I had to rollback my Firefox then install an old extension that allowed the auto-resume function. It worked without a hitch! I was able to leave things downloading overnight without fear of the download cancelling a quarter of the way through with no way of resuming it as I slept.\n\nUntil my Firefox auto-updated (silly me I forgot to turn it off). The functionality is apparently no longer supported in later versions of Firefox. And despite the fact there are several extensions that give this function for older versions of Firefox, none of them work with the current version. Similar story with Chrome and I was unable to find anything for Explorer and Safari.\n\nThis leads me to my question. Is there any reason why auto-resuming downloads is somehow not a thing anymore? Correct me if I’m wrong but it feels like there’s an active effort to remove this functionality from current browsers. Is there a cybersecurity thing at play? I don’t understand why something so beneficial is seemingly blocked.\n\nFor now, I will go ahead and rollback my Firefox and disable auto-update to regain my auto-resuming failed downloads function. In the meantime, the fact that this isn’t a thing will continue to bug me.\n\nLooking forward to anyone who can answer this question!",

One nand forest emulates any given nand forest of a certain size, and the nand forest emulating that answers does it have any solution for all exponential possible inputs.\n\nI call this number, the quantity of nands it takes to answer the npcomplete question about a parameter nand forest, the bigO of npcomplete. In other words, is the bigO of npcomplete (which equals the bigO of this specific question about nands emulating and constraint solving nands) exponential vs subexponential? Its believed by most experts and me that P!=NP but theres so far no proof simple enough that the world agrees that it is a proof. Its instead taken as \"common sense\" that since so many things have been tried, and its vaguely related to various other things that are exponentially hard to compute, it must be that P != NP. I agree, but I think theres a simpler proof somewhere around this model of emulating nands.\n\nHas this research path been explored? Please describe the connection if giving links. I'd prefer small responses making specific math statements or questions instead of go read this large text and figure it out for yourself. A solution should be small simple and undeniable by near any expert who reads it. We dont have that yet.",

Looking at my homework after the first week, as well as the programming projects we have been assigned, it has become abundantly clear that I am not ready to take such a difficult class, at least not at the moment. \n\nMy question is this: should I risk taking the algorithm class this semester and try to push through it, or should I backtrack and take a previous CS course to get more experience with the programming level required to progress through this major?

        "text": "__Main Question__\n\nHow can I make a valid bit, dirty bit, age bit in cache block?\n\n__Detail__\n\nI've recently tried to make cache feature in the pipeline of which I've done before. So, I'm still working on it and I still don't know where should I put those bits in the cache line.\n\nHere is a virtual cache configuration\n* Cache capacity: 64 bytes = 16 words = 2^4 words\n* Block size: 8 bytes = 2 words\n* 4-way set associate\n* 32 bits address line\n* Write policy: write back / write-allocate\n\nWhat I'm having is:\n* The number of set: capacity / (block size * 4 way) = 16 words / (2 words * 4) = 2\n* The number of block: capacity / block size = 8 = 2^3\n\nwhich makes cache line I guess like below table\n\n```\n+-------------------+--------+-----+\n| tag               | index  | off |\n+-------------------+--------+-----+\n 31                4 3      2 1    0\n```\n\nIn this structure, I'm trying to make a dirty bit for write back policy and an age bit for LRU(Least Recent Used). But, there is no space to put those bits so I'm not sure these should be implemented in another table (like TLB) in software context. I'm pretty sure this matter is concerned in hardware context but then again, I can't find this knowledge on a textbook, Hennessy &amp; Patterson. So, please let me know if you have any idea of that or if you find any incorrect information in this text.",

        "text": "Hello guys,\n\nI have an algorithm design for a problem in which we have an n-element set and we are asked if there is a k-element subset that adds up to some number x.\n\nI designed the following algorithm: First pair the first k elements in the set. Then the second and the (k + 1)-st element and so on. If none of these sets yield x as their sum, then increase the spacing. Start from the first element in the set, but then instead of taking the second take the third (thus the space between adjacent elements is no longer 1, but 2).\n\nIf we run all of the sets like this and we can't find a k-element subset that adds up to x, we return false. If we find one such k-element subset, we return true.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n - Is this algorithm \"legit\" in solving this problem?\n - Is the time complexity of this algorithm O(n)? (*My reasoning:* First we go through the array n times, then less, then even less etc.)\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but I'm in a mid sized company that is quickly becoming a large enterprise and we are struggling a lot with dev ops and what exactly the responsibilities of that team is.  Currently, our dev ops builds tools to automate deployments but work to not ultimately be responsible for that deployment and turn it over as soon as possible.  Individual members of the team still own deployments for specific projects but they assert that the only reason they own deployments is because they are still also doing their old job of production support since the entire dev ops team was formerly prod support folks.  \n\nIt's my opinion that dev ops should be fully reponsible for building and using the tools to do the production deployment but I'm struggling to properly argue this point as a front line dev manager.  I've always thought that the tool builders should use them as well.  Prod support should help triage issues and send them to the appropriate team but they shouldn't own deployments.\n\nAre any of you in successfully large enterprises and can shed some light on your process and who owns what, as well as what is successful and what doesn't work?  I have an opportunity to help set the path my organization takes but I'm not sure if I'm taking the right approach.",
