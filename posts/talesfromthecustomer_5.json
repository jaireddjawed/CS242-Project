        "text": "A while ago my friend and I were in a huge chain store. We browsed for a while, bought some items then as we were leaving we noticed some bags/wallets we liked the look of and had a browse of those. \n\nMy friend had put her wallet (which was blue) on top of the other wallets without thinking (they were black.) She then put her own wallet back in her bag. \n\nAs we were leaving we were on the escalator a a security guard was standing one step behind us (which kind of freaked us out because we’re two young females and this guy was about a foot taller than both of us) When we got downstairs he asked where the wallet was. My friend took her wallet out of her bag and showed him. He said “no, I mean the one you took.” She said she didn’t steal anything.\n\nThen he made us come with him out the back. He then proceeded to ask my friend to open her bag and empty the contents on the table. \n\nWhen he realised she’d done nothing wrong he just said to us “you can go” \n\nI get he was doing his job and what she’d done might look suspicious. What annoyed me about that interaction was that he never apologised to my friend for wrongfully accusing her of stealing after making such a big deal about it and shaking her up. \n\nEdit: We also found it funny afterwards he never once asked to check my bag as I had a backpack on and she had a small-medium sized handbag ",

        "text": "I’ve worked retail for more than half my life in some form or another so usually I’m super easy and not confrontational.  I always go by the rules but every now and than I find myself encountering someone who isn’t knowledgable (which I can deal with) **and** stubborn/unrelenting. \n\nOn 7/27 i made an appointment to go get my passport again (having lost the current one) and I don’t drive, nor do I have a state ID. I’ve printed and read and reread the application to apply and nowhere does it state that I need a current valid FBI approved identification. This is important. All I needed was proof of citizenship and an old passport is proof of citizenship.\n\nSo I take the morning off, go in a few minutes early, let them know I’m there and wait for my turn. When I get up there, with all my ducks in a row, the guy tells me: “ they’re going to reject it “ “ you don’t have a current ID? They’re going to reject it. You need to have someone willing to sign a form stating you are who you say you are”.\n\nI tried to reason and he says “I can take it , but it’s going to get rejected and sent back anyways” \n\nAt this point he sounds so sure of himself that I decided not to. I got a money order for exactly $200 (passport, passport card and $60 to expedite) as well as $35 for the handling fee. I didn’t want to send it in only to be turned around and delayed again.\n\nBut something was nagging at me because I know I read the instructions carefully. So I sat down and reread it and than I went up and asked him if it says I just need to show citizenship proof and an old passport would work... he just repeated himself again about how it’s not a current ID.\n\nLong story short he told me to call the 800 number before I go next time—government numbers always has the long waits, he said no, actually this one doesn’t. So I call and of course I’m on hold but he doesn’t care...\n\nLuckily it wasn’t too long of a wait, a few minutes later someone was able to tell me that I can use my old passport, and to turn it in anyways. I got his name &amp; date/time we spoke just in case...and I turned it in while the guy still wanted to tell me that when it gets rejected I have 90 days to do the letter or show other proof otherwise the passport agency keeps my $200. Thanks dude.\n\nTLDR/postal worker insisted my application would get rejected because I didn’t have current government ID even though the application doesn’t state that that’s a requirement.\n\nHappy ending 8/4 today I got my passport.",

        "text": "I was looking for materials to make a diaper cake for a baby shower. I was in the crafts section of the store, looking at the ribbons, trying to decide on which one to get. Meanwhile, two young employees were nearby, chatting loudly. One was a man in his early 20s, and the other was a girl in her teens. The girl asked the man about his love life, and he told her that he was only casually dating at the time. The girl said, “Yeah, I know you aren’t going to settle down. You’re just gonna mess around for a while.”\n\nI didn’t care about their conversation at the time and I minded my own business. They’re young...that’s what young people do. I’m a 30-year-old woman, and even I spoke about my personal life with my coworkers, but we always did it privately. So I continued to browse the crafts section and moved along. \n\nHowever, the employees’ conversation continued for another 15 minutes and it was loud. It became more inappropriate with more details of their love lives. The girl asked her coworker personal questions while they were stocking shelves in different aisles. He shouted back. They kept talking, making me feel uncomfortable, and I didn’t want to leave because I really needed stuff from this section. My blood was boiling because I really wanted them to stop, and I was trying to be patient. They didn’t care that I was there and kept talking (really, they were shouting at each other). \n\nFinally, I just snapped. The girl was LOUDLY telling her coworker about a date, about how the boy was touching her in all different places. I said, “OK, you need to stop. You guys have been making me feel uncomfortable for the last 15 minutes. You’ve been talking about personal stuff loudly and it’s inappropriate.” The man looked at me and smirked, while the girl looked embarrassed. “No, this isn’t funny. It’s unprofessional. You have been loudly talking about inappropriate, personal stuff and not even once asked me for help. I’m a customer here.” \n\nI walked away, and yes, I had to be that person and told the manager. There’s a time and place for everything, and the sales floor full of customers isn’t the place to talk about your sex life. Do that shit when the store is closed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Let me clarify. I mentioned above that I was browsing THE ENTIRE crafts section, which was made up of 4 aisles. I wasn’t just standing there uncomfortable in one aisle. I walked around because the things I needed were in different aisles. I could STILL hear those two because they were very loud. I mentioned that they were working in separate aisles and basically shouted at each other to carry the conversation. \n\nEdit 2: Please read the whole post before commenting. Some of you replied, “Why didn’t you say something to them? What did they say that was so wrong?” I was descriptive and I gave all the relevant details, even about how I confronted the employees. Don’t skim and comment. \n\nThanks for reading. ",

Miraculously she could breathe, and you could see it too via opening her mouth.\n\nSo she's rushed to the ER of choice in particular by her parents. Things go really sideways there. After waiting an eternity she's finally seen because that's the way most ER'S work. The doctor comes in, opens her mouth and TELLS HER TO BREATHE IN AS DEEP AS SHE CAN.\n\nWe collectively lose it. How idiotic! Her mom insists it's a bad idea and just asks the doctor what else they can do to get it out. He ignores the concern and continues to tell the little girl to breathe in. She's only 5 and listens to him. UNSURPRISINGLY it's gets lodged down more and she starts choking. The doctor pats her back and tells her to breathe. After the coughing fit she says her chest really hurts. The lego is no longer visible.\n\nThey decide to X-ray her. IT'S IN HER LUNG NOW. And she had to have emergency surgery right there and kept at the hospital for 3 days because of a shitty doctor.",

We went in and sat down at one of only 6 tables. My husband went to the restroom, and a young man came and asked for our drink orders. I ordered a corona for the hubs and a jumbo margarita for myself. Hubs returns, and a female waitress approaches the young man and converses with him in Spanish. She then asks my husband what he wanted to drink, and he told her. She disappears for a few, and then returns. She approaches my husband and asks him what he would like to order. Since we had already discussed what we both wanted, he gave her my order and then his. Mind you, she has yet to even look in my direction. She leaves, and returns with our drinks. Tells husband food will be out shortly and asks if he needs anything else, still ignoring me. A bit later, she brings out the food. She is facing him as she places my food in the center of the table and his directly in front of him.  After we are done eating, she comes back to collect our plates and leaves the bill. The next time we see her, I held up the bill with my credit card, and she walked right by me but didn't stop. The next time she came by, my husband repeated the move, and she stopped to take the bill, and asked him how everything was and if he needed anything else. She returned the card and receipt to him, still refusing to even look at me. I wasn't upset at any of this, but rather amused. The kicker: the margarita she made me was pretty much straight tequila. A jumbo glass of tequila. I could just barely sip it at first because it was like doing shots, but about a third of the way through it started tasting really good. I had a really good buzz by the time I finished it. The whole incident was extremely odd to say the least, but we had a good story to tell our friends when we met up with them later.",

I will be M, friend one will be K, his son will be L and other friend will be T.  Asshole waiter will be AW. \n\nSo we decided to sit outside on the patio deck by the river. This place wasn’t what I’d call busy, seats maybe 50 and there was probably 20 people. We ordered some beers and food. I won’t sugar coat it, we finished out beers in like 15 minutes, we were thirsty, frig off Barb!  \n\nAW brings our apps and says “ Wow, we’re a thirsty bunch out here aren’t we?”\n\nT “Uh, yeah, we like cold PBR.”\nAW does nothing. Doesn’t ask if we want refills, just walks away. Okay then?\n15 min later he comes back.\n\nAW “So did you want another round?” \nK&amp;M “Yeah, please.” \n\n10 minutes later. We get our beer, wrong beer but whatever. We drank it anyway. I go to the bathroom and see our food sitting in the window. I was gone for probably 5 or more. A few more minutes we got our food. We’re not upset, this place has good food and usually great service, if you can take the wait.  But then AW decides it’s time to be a dick. \n\nAW “ So are you guys going to drink anymore or have more food or?”\n\nT “ Yeah I might have one more beer, I’m not driving.”\n\nAW “Good thing you’re not.”\n\nT “....”\n\nI found a hair in Ls food and half of mine was cold, Ts was wrong but he’s not picky. When AW brought the last beer, we mentioned the errors with our meals and the hair. Unconcerned, just an “Oh okay.” \n\nWe finished our food and waited another 15 minutes before he asked about our bills, T and myself were on one and L&amp;K on another. We pay, I use the restroom again and we leave. This building is on a corner plot and the deck is out back over the river. \n\nLike I said this place had delicious food and decent staff the other times we had been here. This was the longest I had ever waited for food and drinks from this place. We tipped combined maybe $12. Call us bad people but this was the worst experience I’d ever had there. \n\nAW ran outside after us onto the street and yells “Hey man was there something wrong with the service!?”\n\nK “Yeah we told you our food was wrong, cold and my sons food had a hair in it, you didn’t apologize and on top of all of that you were insulting and rude.”\n\nAnd on top of everything that happened, I called the place the next day to complain, no one called me back, I left a review on Facebook a few days after with all of this info, I mentioned that no one got back with me. They messaged me back an hour later. We were offered to have our meals comped but it wasn’t worth the drive back. \n\n",

My mom and I, along with my friend and her husband and her mom all went to a big city as a day trip roughly three hours away. We spent most of the day driving around to different malls and stores, so we were understandable tired by the end. On our way back home, we decided we wanted to eat somewhere nicer, so we stopped at a store named after cheese. It wasn’t super busy or anything and we were sat down immediately. \n\nIt took forever for our server to come and take our drinks, orders, really anything. We hardly saw her the whole time we were there. So at the end when we finally got our bill, we were in debate how much tip to even give her. My friend’s mom is really nice and decided she would still tip her well, it was $10 or $20. She decided to have fun with it though, and put it behind the salt caddy that sat in the middle of the table and sat something on the corner of it. It was still easily visible though. \n\nShe went on out to the car along with my friend’s husband while the other three of us went to the bathroom. We were walking out of said bathroom to the doors when our server came jogging up to us, asking if we left her a tip. We were shocked to say the least. Who comes chasing after customers to see if they left you a tip when they were a horrible server? I was so tempted to run back to our table and take the tip and replace it with a few bucks. She sure as hell did nothing to deserve it. \n\nEdit: since multiple people seem to think we hid the tip, we didn’t. It was a corner table, with the salt caddy in the center of the table. We put the tip behind the caddy, where it wouldn’t be visible to someone just walking by he table. My friend’s mom didn’t want the tip to be stolen. Hence why it was behind the caddy and had something, probably a cup sitting on the corner of it. If she had reached over to get our plates or cups, she would have been able to see it.",

Thing about me is I love game lore so after completing the main storyline in 4 I looked up lore for the other games, especially 3 and New Vegas because I was thinking about buying a copy of both.\n\nI go to the store and right away the two guys at the counter are asking if I'm looking for Just Dance or some karaoke game, I still don't know why. maybe management made them say it to everyone? I just say no and I said it was a stretch but did they have any copies of Fallout 3 or New Vegas in stock.\n\nNow I don't know what went through this guy's head but Asshole Clerk (AC) laughs at me (M) while Poor Co-worker (PC) is actually doing his job and looking through their system for my request.\n\nAC: I don't think you'll like this game, it's for adults. You should stick to Kingdom Hearts.\n\nM: (is a female wearing a Kingdom Hearts t-shirt) I've been playing Fallout 4 for a few months now. I can like both so I don't see what the problem is.\n\nAC: Just because you've played it doesn't mean you understand it. I've played 3 and New Vegas and they're nothing like 4. I'm not giving you a refund later because they're \"too complicated\".\n\nM: (thinking maybe if I tell him I've been reading up on lore he'll change his tune) I've actually been reading about the lore and it's why I want to get them, I find the vault-tec experiments interesting and like looking through the buildings and piecing together how life was like before the bombs fell.\n\nAt this time PC cuts in to say they don't have 3 in stock but they have a copy of Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition in stock. I told PC I'd take it and he went to fetch the game from the shelf and I hear AC mutter about \"stupid fake gamer c*nts\"\n\nThat was it, I politely informed PC I changed my mind about buying the game and asked if I could cancel my pre-order of Pokemon Ultra Moon. PC was glaring at AC the entire time as he cancelled my pre-order account and I left.\n\nI don't know what bug crawled up AC's ass but I was done with that store. I called the store later on that week to complain about AC and made sure to mention PC did nothing wrong and was wonderful with helping me but AC made me feel unwelcome and I left. \n\nI get there are some hardcore gamers out there and that whole \"you're not a real fan unless you've played them all\" shtick, but answer this one question.\n\nHow tf am I supposed to do that when you won't sell me the damn games?!\n\nTL;DR: asshole guy working at game store didn't like a girl wearing a Kingdom Hearts shirt also likes playing Fallout 4 and mutters about \"stupid fake gamer c*nts\" when I try to buy Fallout New Vegas.\n\nEdit: added I'm a female to when I mentioned I'm wearing a KH shirt for clarification about my gender!\n\nUPDATE: alright this blew up while I was at work but let me explain some quick things that I saw multiple comments about.\n\nThis game store is a small business and when I called I did talk to the manager/owner (can't remember which since this was like a year and a half ago but it was a head of the store). He said he'd be sure to write up AC and talk to him.\n\nI did buy the games online at an even better price than the store because of a sale going on and I love both of them! \n\nI haven't been back to the store since the incident to see what happened to AC not just because of the incident but more because I'm working on going to college to become a teacher and that's been my main focus instead of games.\n\nAlso thank you anonymous person that gave me gold! I don't know how this was worth it but bless your soul!",

        "text": "Background: I rigorously log everything I eat into MyFitnessPal; most blood-draw labwork requires that you not eat or drink for eight hours prior to the draw (exceptions - IE, non-fasting bloodwork or longer fasts - will be called out specifically,) and most instruction sheets given to a patient will simplify this as \"no food or drink after midnight.\"\n\nYesterday morning I spent all morning (beginning from midnight 'til like, way after sunup,) playing video games with a friend over the internet, and at ~1:30 AM (definitely prior to 2 AM,) I snacked on a bread-stick. Later in the morning (6:30ish,) I was heading to the kitchen to get dinner, and a fortuitous mis-tap on my phone brought up the calendar app, in which I saw that I had a notice to get bloodwork done sometime this month.\n\nBeing a believer in striking whilst the iron is hot (lest I forget to strike *at all,*) and not wanting to put off something moderately unpleasant (eight hours without food followed by driving whilst a little fatigued,) for fear of putting it off until it was completely out of mind, I simply resolved to wait until after ten and go get blood drawn.\n\nI do so, and in fact it's after eleven when I get to the draw clinic, sign in, etc. I hand over the blood-draw paperwork, and I ask \"All of these are eight-hour fasts, right?\"\n\nThe lady behind the counter scoffs. \"Psssht, it don't matter,\" she says as she scans the paperwork. \"As long as you haven't eaten or drank anything after midnight.\"\n\n\"But,\" says I, \"I *have* eaten after midnight.\"\n\nHer eyes narrow; I can see in them that she's assuming I'm going to be one of *those* customers. The ones who think that at least one of chronology, biology, or chemistry don't apply to me. \"When'd you eat,\" she asks me.\n\n\"About one-forty-five AM,\" I say. It now being about 11:30, more than 9 hours have passed.\n\n\"Oh! That's fine,\" she says, waving me back.\n\nAll is well, then, but still; I asked specifically if they were eight-hour fasts. She could have given me the benefit of assuming I was capable of the basic timekeeping and arithmetic required to understand that \"no food or drink after midnight\" is rule-of-thumb which assumes most people are night-sleepers who, when they have bloodwork, will forgo morning breakfast and turn up around the hour of 8-9 AM, but that I was in fact independently capable of counting back from 11:30 to 3:30 AM and assuring her I had not eaten after that hour.",

        "text": "(TL;DR at the end)\n\nThis happened a long time ago, but it still makes me seriously angry whenever I think about it, and I've boycotted this particular chain of stores ever since.\n\nSo, I was an innocent little 15-16yo girl, and we had a formal-ish high school dance coming up, so a group of my friends decided to go dress shopping at the local mall. I hated clothes shopping to begin with, but agreed to go because things like going to the mall unsupervised were still fun and novel back then.\n\nWe go into a small women's clothing shop and my friends pick out a couple of dresses to try. Keep in mind, one of my friends is a heavier girl, and this store carries pretty small sizes, but some of the dresses seemed like they might fit. The saleslady doesn't show much interest in serving us from the get-go, but isn't bothering us either.\n\nLarger friend in question goes into the fitting rooms to try on a dress and comes back out to show it to us. Around this time, she notices that the zipper is broken and mentions it to the saleslady. Saleslady immediately comes flying over (it's a very small store) and starts accusing my friend of breaking the zipper, implying that she's trying on clothes that are too small for her and that's why it broke. My friend is mortified and tells the saleslady that she never tried to zip the dress, so how could she have broken the zipper? Jerk Lady is having none of it and continues to accuse my friend of breaking it.\n\nMy friend goes back into the fitting room to change back into her own clothes and comes out with the dress in hand. Saleslady takes it from her and starts hustling us out of the store, telling us to \"come back when we have our mothers with us\" and essentially implying that we have no money and are just there to screw around without buying anything.\n\nThis was the first time I had ever been treated poorly in a store because of my age, and the first time I had ever witnessed such a blatant act of body-shaming by an adult. This group of friends and I were all very polite, quiet, respectful girls, who had every intention of purchasing clothes that day. We had no idea what to do. None of us had ever really been scolded or treated this way by adults--again, we never did anything to get ourselves into trouble. So, we hurried out with our tails between our legs, hurt and embarrassed.\n\nI wish I could say we reported her, left a bad review, or basically did anything about it, but we were bewildered kids and had no idea how to handle the situation, so nothing happened. I still won't shop at that particular chain, both because their clothes are overpriced and barely fit average-sized women and because I get anxious just walking into one (I have anxiety issues unrelated to this incident, but it didn't help).\n\n**TL;DR:** Saleslady at a clothing shop body-shames my friend and accuses her of damaging a dress by trying on sizes that are too small for her, then accuses us of not having any money and just being in the shop to screw around, solely because we're teenagers. Ageism and body-shaming at their finest.",

        "text": "(First time posting, please be kind. Also, mobile)\n\nI was sitting in a certain square-burgered, red haired fast food joint, having gotten my regular food. Now, this place is near where I work and I have a 45-60 minute drive back home. I stop there after work when I'm hungry - sometimes their bacon and cheese fries aren't always up to snuff, and one time I walked in to nobody at the counter, and had to wait a little bit, but there has been nothing that would cause me to complain. \n\nSo, one day I'm sitting in, eating my burger and bacon/cheese fries, minding my own business, chilling on my phone. And in marches this woman, who hadn't been in here in the time that I was there (I didn't get a look at her because I sit with my back to the drink machine cause I'm paranoid lol), and she strolls up to the counter and starts letting them have it.\n\nShe starts yelling at the guy behind the counter, who apparently didn't put lids on her two frozens to go. He tell her that they ran out of the small cup lids behind the counter. She then proceeds to keep yelling at him for not having small cup lids and asks him how he gets to run the counter, being so incompetent.\n\nThe manager (or who I assume was the manager) comes up and gives what I assume is always the answer when someone harrasses the employees, which is that he's new. She then demands to know how he can be running the counter if he's new and then starts yelling about how this is training and that they should train their employees to put the lids on the frozens, ignoring the fact they they didn't have any lids to put on them. I'm pretty sure this lasted for at least five minutes. \n\nThere were some small lids by the drink machine. She could have put them on herself...\n\n(At the end it was funny because I'm pretty sure they forgot I was there because the manger was swearing right after she left until I got up to dump my tray lol)\n\nBut I felt very bad for these employees who are literally just doing their job for a thankless customer base.",

        "text": "This happened at a big box electronics store. And not the blue and yellow one we're all thinking, either, this one is more computer oriented but sells all manner of weird stuff too.\n\nA lot of preamble: A friend and I have been through so much crap at these stores that honestly, things going wrong is expected. WAY too many times we'll go and we'll get something only to find parts are missing or someone jacked something and resealed the box. 90% of the reps are clueless and will fight you to get commission for something they didn't sell.\n\n(Which is why whenever we go and can't find something, we opt to circle around and around versus asking for help. Because if we ask for help, the rep who points out where something is is going to want to write up a sales slip for it, which takes a fair amount of time, and it basically gives them credit for selling us something...which they didn't. We already knew what we were coming in for, we just couldn't locate where it is in this MASSIVE store. Like one time we had to buy a Core i5 CPU and it was discontinued so we couldn't just go somewhere else...and it took them a half hour to \"write us up\" for it. Yeah...)\n\nSo, back to the issue at hand. We're at this store because one of our friends is visiting us and had never been to this store (or its better equivalent). We spy some cheapo $1 screen protectors for our phones, so we decide to pick a couple up, and we head to checkout. Friend's covering everything since it's only $2.\n\nCashier scans one. Rings up fine. Cashier tries to ring up the other, won't scan. She keeps trying. Over and over. For at least a couple minutes. \n\nShe calls over another cashier, who tries some things. Second thing won't scan, still. Keeps trying for another couple minutes. At this point friend is looking visibly frustrated, I crack a joke about how we had to give our friend the true $CrappyElectronicsStore experience. \n\nThey call a manager over. Who's looking intently at the POS system. Trying to figure out why it won't scan. Keeps trying to scan it. Nothing's happening of course. (Hey, can we get the definition of insanity please? Thanks!)\n\nAt this point my friend has had enough.\n\n\"Can't you just scan the first one twice? They're literally the same thing.\"\n\n\"Uhhh are you sure about that?\" The manager was ridiculously resistant to doing what had to be one of the most obvious things ever. I mean, I get it for inventory control purposes\\*, but this is quite literally the *very same item with the very same UPC.*\n\n\"Yes. Check the UPC. They're the same.\"\n\nFinally having a sudden outbreak of common sense, the manager compares the UPC and product numbers of the two packages and concludes that YES, these are both the very same item, and scans the first one again. Scans perfectly, and we're on our way.\n\nWhat also perplexes me is unless whoever designed their POS system is...well, ridiculously inept, pretty much every POS system has a provision for manual entry in case the barcodes don't work, not sure why it never crossed their minds to do that.\n\n- - -\n\n\\* *To expand on this a little bit more, I used to work grocery and we had our own house brand for soda, all of it being the same price regardless of flavor. What some cashiers used to do is just take one bottle and quantity it when they scanned it, so telling the scanner \"hey, when I scan this, multiply it by how many bottles are in the customer's cart\". Worked fine if you had one person with multiples of the same flavor, but cashiers were doing this for ALL of the bottles regardless of flavor, which threw our inventory numbers. In THAT case I can understand the aversion to just scanning the same item twice to ring out another item. But in this case there was absolutely zero difference between the two.*",

The restaurant is a place I’ve eaten at multiple times, and the staff messes with you, so it’s a lot of fun... usually. We were really excited since it was my friend’s 16 birthday dinner. We were seated, and our waitress seemed less than enthusiastic (annoyed and grumpy, really), so we decided to egg her on by chewing gum and asking for ketchup (two very well known triggers for antics to happen). We did this to make sure she knew that we knew this restaurant messes with you (did that make sense?). She ignored these things which, while disappointing, was fine since everyone can have bad days. \n\nWe proceeded to order a refillable barbecue skillet for our main courses, which we finished quickly after a day at the theme park. We decided to get a refill. We asked for it, and drink refills, multiple times over about thirty minutes, which is when we became slightly irritated. When a manager came over, my friend’s parents told him about not getting it... which is when our waitress showed up. She seemed even more upset, but we finally had our food. \n\nOur server knew it was my friend’s birthday since it was noted on our reservation, and she brought a huge cupcake out, complete with a candle. She asked if we knew how to sing Happy Birthday backwards (we said no) and she proceeded to turn around backwards to sing the song. We were all so excited, thinking we’d finally have the level of service expected from this theme park!\n\nBoy, were we wrong. The waitress proceeded to smash the cupcake in my friend’s face (after the candle was blown out lol) with a malicious look. We were all so stunned that her parents just payed the bill and left. We honestly didn’t realize how bad this was until a couple days later. \n\nThere are other small things that happened, but the story is already long. \n\n",

        "text": "I stopped by a mall bookstore today to pick up some magazines for foreign guests who were staying with me.  \n\nI picked out 3 magazines at a total of \\~$20 worth and went to pay with 5 $5 bills.  The cashier handled my bills curiously and then used a counterfeit pen to check them.  He told me they felt funny (again, $5 bills) and that he couldn't accept them.  (The counterfeit pen didn’t leave a mark).  He didn't want to take any cash from me so I ended up having to pay with a card.  He was nice otherwise, held a conversation with me and answered my questions, made sure I found everything I needed, etc.  It was just such an odd experience.  I've never heard of anyone being suspected of passing such small fake bills.  I cashier at my job (a restaurant) and see 50 and 100 dollar bills regularly, we don't really bother to check them unless there's really something funny about them.  And certainly don't think twice about any bill smaller.\n\nSeemed a little over the top for 20 bucks worth of product.\n\nEdit: added info\n\nEdit 2: Wow I can’t believe what some people get away with xD gluing an extra 0 on the bill, the other side of the bill blank.  If mine are a fake it’s extremely convincing.  Has the hologram 5s, security strips, both sides of the bill are printed.  Same size as others, same color.  Can’t feel anything really strange with it, although they may be a bit newer as they are crisper than some of my beat up old 5s so don’t have quite as much wear.  Kinda want to get them checked out by a bank and see who’s right here\n\nUpdate: Took them to the bank on the off chance there was something to worry about since apparently fake small bills can be more common than I thought. The teller gave me an incredulous look when I plopped the 5s in front of her and asked me where I had trouble.  She took them back to run through her machine and they checked out.  I’m not a criminal after all 👌",

My partner, upon picking up her delights was offered a free chocolate doughnut for each of us, so two doughnuts. My order took a bit longer as I had ordered last. When I picked up my goods, a different worker gave me two doughnuts, one for myself and one for my partner (who already had one for each of us). I pointed this out as I didn't want more than my fair share but I was told to take them anyway as they were giving them away.\n\n So in all, we walked out with 6 delicious doughnuts, 4 of which were free! \n\nIt's only a small gesture but it's customer service like that that'll keep people coming back, even if there are no free doughnuts! \n\n",

As such, I spend a lot of my days just kind of in a funk, going from thing to thing just trying to get by until I can clock out and go back home. A few days back, I was driving to work and decided to stop by a national coffee chain to get some iced coffee before work.  \n\n\nEverything goes smoothly, and I pull up to the window to pay. The cashier greets me and I hand him my debit card. I see him put it into the chip machine, take it out, put it back in, messes around with a bunch of other things on the payment terminal, puts it back in the machine. Nothing. He finally opens the window.  \n\n\nCashier: \"Hey, I'm really sorry but your card isn't working, do you have any other way to pay?\"  \n\n\nI felt like a huge jerk at this point because I really didn't have any other way to pay; I just wasted his time and also I didn't look like I was just trying to con my way into a free drink or something.\n\nMe: \"Oh man I'm really sorry it always works—I'm really sorry to waste your time. Thank you anyway.\"  \n\n\nCashier: \"Just take it—I got you.\"  \n\n\nMe: \"Excuse me?\"\n\nCashier: \"Yeah don't worry about it, I already made it you can just take it.\"  \n\n\nMe: \"Really?\"\n\nCashier: \"Yeah it's really not a big deal, you can have it.\"  \n\n\nI thanked him a ton and told him how much I appreciated it. I tried to go in the next day and pay for it and give him a tip but he wasn't in and they said not to worry about the payment. I started carrying cash after that just in case (honestly going around with one card was a bad habit I had gotten into). In the midst of a really bad couple of weeks having someone be so effortlessly gracious and kind really went a long way, and I hope it gets back around to him some way. ",

We find this upscale burger place that has great reviews as well as having won an award for there dip from a major network. \n\nWe head over there and order some food and decide to try the dip.  It shows up with fresh made chips,  The chips where o.k. but tasted kind of burnt but for our taste the dip was horrible.  We had no intention of not paying for it because its one of their most popular dishes.\n\nOur server comes over right before our main meal arrives and noticed we barely touched the dip and asked if we don't like it.  My wife and I both answered it wasn't our cup of tea but we don't want anything in return we just wanted to try something different and we are 100% sure it wasn't their fault.  Next the cook comes over and we tell them the same thing.  Finally the manager comes over and we state the same thing its just not fair to them to cost them food cost for us being picky eaters.\n\nThe rest of our meal was great and we get the check.  The manager comes over and states that he took the dip off and 10% of our remaining bill.  I of course tipped what had been taken off but on the way home we laughed because we had what amounted to a polite argument with 1/2 the staff throughout the entire meal about it and in the end they didn't listen.  We would go back and I do think it was good customer service in a fashion but it did make us feel a little bad because we are pickier eaters then most.",

I'm a petrolhead so I decided to take a look under the car and I noticed some inconsistencies.

The last day I was there, I ordered another bloody Mary. I got it and it was extremely heavy handed on the horse radish and just wasn't good. I had also ordered food and was eating that with water. The Romanian waitress came back and noticed I hadn't drank my bloody mary. She asked what was wrong with it and I told her. I had planned on still paying for it and still getting another drink. A different Romanian waitress came out and asked me what she should tell the bartender. I was confused, but still told her what I told the first waitress. Then the bartender came out to talk to me about it. He then told me that hes not a bartender, but the chef of the restaurant and was just filling in because the regular bartender couldn't make it. He explained that they premix their house blends and someone added too much to the mix. \n\n\nHe ended up comping the drink and getting me the most delicious pina colada and we talked for a while about how delicious the meal was and about how super cool it was that we got local food when we weren't from there.\n\n\nWe learned that they split tips and tipped them accordingly to where they all got a really good tip, because they were amazing! It just shows that being honest about what you don't like will help you in the long run. Don't make excuses or beat around the Bush. Tell your waiter if you don't like a dish or drink in a respectful manner, and they will help you out. ",

I had been telling my nephew about how good the food was at Roofie's, but how bad the service always seemed to be. So I was looking over at Roofie, and...it was nearly 5:30 PM, and there were no cars in the parking lot. It looked like no lights were on inside, either. I pulled into the lot and read a notice on the door that the location had permanently closed. The other location down the highway apiece had closed, too. Man...I guess the service really was that bad!\n\nSo we headed on over to ISLOB for burgers. Almost no one was there. Granted, it was Monday evening, but still, the place was almost deserted. I think I even overheard the waitresses debating over who would go home first.\n\nOur burgers were fine. Nothing stellar. Definitely not a Roofie. They came with endless fries, so I asked for a plate of fries. Yay, thanks. Such a small plate of fries you gave me. Look, y'all. I *love* fries. When I order a plate of fries, I want one of those ISLOB omelette jon boat platters docking a load of fries in front of me!\n\nAnyway...has anyone else noticed whether cookie cutter diners like Roofie Newsday, O'Snarley's, Crabapplecheez, OMGIF's, Silli's, and such places are having a hard time universally?",

We had gotten a gamecube for Christmas, and since we didnt really own any games we only got to experience new games via the now defunct video rental store. I rented Pikmin this particular time, and was excited to test it out. The gaming tv we had was a large, very heavy CRT with one set of RGB that we used for any electronic device connected to it. The tv was on a stand on the corner of the room, so you had to turn it carefully to unplug and plug in whatever you wanted to use. As the final step in this Home Alone disaster, our gamecube was sitting right below the tv on the ground.\n\nI, in my excited 6 year old wisdom, wanted to play the gamecube, but there was something else plugged in. I figured no problem, just turn the tv and be done with it. Well, turns out I wasnt that coordinated, and the tv fell right on top of the gamecube. The system and tv survived (no idea how), but the game inside, Pikmin of course, had snapped in half.\n\nKeep in mind, paying to replace these discs ran over $100 at the time, money which my parents didnt really have. I don’t remember much detail of how my mom reacted, but when we got to the video store, this was how the conversation played out.\n\nMom (M), video store cashier (C)\n\nM: hi, my son accidentally broke this game, is there any way to fix or replace it?\n\nC: uhh, I don’t see any damage\n\nM: (not understanding) what do you mean, its broken?\n\nC: No ma’am, I really don’t see what is wrong. Maybe you are mistaken. We can return this right now if you want.\n\nMy mom eventually caught on, and was forever grateful that the cashier helped us out.\n\nTL;DR: I broke game, we couldn’t really afford to pay for broken game, cashier didn’t make us pay for broken game",

It's like 5:30 and the salons are closing in a couple of hours so I call and end up at my 2nd choice salon. Mom's had fine experiences there so whatever.\n\nImportant to this story is I have destroyed my nails chewing and am kind of terrified to be mocked by the nail techs for it. But I'm determined to go get whatever fake nails the tech thinks is best. I go in, get them done, whatever. Tech seems fine.\n\nJust a few days later and I've already had one nail come off and another painfully half off. I go back in, assuming this is my fault or an accident and ask to get them fixed. \n\nTech who did them is busy so I explain the issue to someone working next to her. The ladies talk for a moment (not in english so I have no idea what's going on) then the 2nd tech starts chastising me for nail chewing! She has me come over and tells me to wait for the tech who did my nails. But first, she RIPS off the half-torn nail, causing me to bleed. Doesn't seem concerned about the customer bleeding in the waiting area. More concerned with judging me for my nails.\n\nI've worked customer service plenty and hate complaining  about service so I wait. Finally the original tech calls me over and exclaims \"Wow they lasted almost a week! I expected you to lose those in 3 days!\" Repeatedly.\n\nExcuse me, what? She never said this to me or implied in any way these would be different than for regular nails. I say this and she insists she told me. The other tech chimes in, telling me I have to stop chewing. I'm almost crying at this point, half upset and half PISSED. They're chewing me out and straight up lying?\n\nEnded up walking out and headed over to my 1st choice salon. Awesome assistant manager fixed them all because the first tech did a shit job, they look 10x better. Apparently they won't last because of my fucked nail beds but she's nice and commends me for wanting to try and stop. Even ended up under-charging me for the amount of work she did because I wasn't a bitch about the fuckup at what turned out to be their sister salon.\n\nTLDR; nail techs lied and mocked me, left me bleeding. Walked out and got great service elsewhere.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hopefully this is a fit here..\n\nI've got bad nausea due to morning sickness, toddler is in stage 5 clinger mode and so I order mexican food from a certain delivery company. I order online, opt to pay in cash. I was told to expect $42 total at the door including about a $4 tip for the driver that I included and the typical $3 delivery fee.\n\n70 minutes goes by, I'm now hungry and a bit angry but hey here's our food! Go down with $44 on hand and he goes oh it's $53! \n\nMe: That's literally not what the order on my computer says.\n\nHim: They typically don't do deliveries with us (lie - they have in the past, it's just infrequent) and so they ordered us since their own guy wasn't available and since you are paying in cash and not online the difference in delivery gets charged to you.\n\nMe: Literally any other day I would have to turn this order back around. I just don't usually order more than I carry on hand most days but I'm too nauseated to cook and my kid will mutiny if I don't feed him. It's a miracle I have the extra cash. So here's the difference anyways.\n\nHim: Uh huh.\n\nSo I hit up twitter and tag the delivery company who tells me to Live Chat them and they just had to throw the restaurant so hard under the bus. This may legit sour their future relations. They tell me to make an honest review on the website about the restaurant but the fault doesn't lie with them, the delivery folks.\n\nSo I do but I don't fault the food or anything, just the whole shock at the door. There was 70 minutes I could have been informed about the difference and wasn't.\n\nNot five minutes later the restaurant calls me. Says while yes, typically they don't use the delivery side of the website and tonight they had to due to their own guy being unavailable ... well the increase was supposed to be charged to them by the company. Not me. I wasn't supposed to be charged the difference at all.\n\nNow they're enroute to drop off the $10.\n\nWhat blows me away is the delivery company didn't think to call the customer ahead (who's paying cash) to verify the increase in delivery. Followed by how hard the delivery company also tossed the restaurant under the bus on the Live Chat service I spoke to them on.",

        "text": "I fell while traveling alone and cracked one of my lower ribs. Any time I breathe deep, bend over, or even try to lay down I get this stabbing pain. I’m okay sitting up straight and standing, but anything else causes a sharp pain that takes a while to calm down. In addition to the rib, I think I probably strained my intercostal muscles or obliques on the same side of the injury. After a day or two my back starts locking up and spazzing. Being injured while staying at a hotel is no fun but today (well yesterday) was the dreaded flight home.\n\nI decided to pay to check my bag for the flight home because it hurts to lift anything. I did not want to have to lift it to the overhead bin. I also moved my seats to an aisle seat at the front of economy plus section for both flights. Unfortunately, I still have a heavy backpack that has my laptop and other valuables that I’m not going to check. It’s painful to put my backpack on, and once it’s on my back starts to lock up, but I grit my teeth and manage. I figure once I get on the plane I can kick it under the seat in front of me and I’ll be okay.\n\nWell I got on the plane only to find someone sitting in my assigned seat, and someone’s bag under the seat in front of me. I show the man that’s sitting in my seat my ticket and he begrudgingly moves over to the middle seat where he was assigned. I sit down with my backpack in my lap and ask the guy if the bag underneath the seat in front of me was his and he said no. There is no bag underneath the seat in front of him so I see if I can move the other smaller bag in front of me over so I could fit my bag under the seat in front of me. He says “NO, you can’t put it there!” then kicks his legs out as far as he can and crosses his arms (this is right behind first class so there is already ample leg room). Still determined to not have to put my bag in the overhead bin I move the bag in front of me temporarily into the aisle to see if I can stuff both bags underneath. Well this was a mistake as people are still being herded onto the plane and as I push it out a lady stops right in front of me and shouts “REALLY?”. This gets the attention of the flight attendant who comes over to see what the ruckus is about. I ask the flight attendant if the bag is hers and she said “Yes, I always put my bag there. You need to put your bag in the overhead bin.” I reply telling her that I have a cracked rib and it’s painful to lift my bag to the overhead bin and she replies saying she doesn’t care and that I don’t have a choice. So I walk over to an area where there is space in the overhead bin and as I’m lifting my bag up there I knew I made a mistake. It causes me an instant sharp pain that lingers. Luckily the guy sitting across from was nice and offered to take the bag down at the end of the flight. As a guy, it’s hard asking for or accepting help with something so simple, but I let him do it.\n\nOne flight down and one to go before I can go home. I have a two hour layover so I grab something to eat at a sit down restaurant before heading to my gate. On my way to the gate I stop by the bathroom to take off my rib belt and inspect my ribs. I probably look like a drug smuggler messing with a thick velcroed bandage across my abdomen, but I don’t care at this point. While in the restroom I heard something mentioning my hometown but couldn’t quite make it out. Once I sat down at my gate I apparently lost track of all space and time. Close to two hours goes by and I start to think “Why haven’t they boarded yet?” I walk next to the gate only to find that my city is no longer listed, then I look down at my clock and find out my flight was scheduled to leave from a different gate an hour ago! Apparently they had announced the gate change while I was in the bathroom. I grab my backpack and book it to the new gate. Jogging with a backpack and a fractured rib is beyond painful, but I just want to get home. As I approach the new gate I’m surprised to find that they are just about to start boarding. Apparently there was a gate change, and then the flight was delayed an hour and a half (because it’s hot and sunny outside apparently). Whatever, I’ll take it.\n\nDetermined to not have the same situation happen this flight I ask the gate agent if I can pre-board explaining my situation. They allow it, but this pisses off the people that are in first class that are waiting to board. My ticket has issues scanning at the machine and there angry first class passengers behind me so I just let them through. I finally get on the plane only to find the exact same flight attendant that was on my previous flight! Sure enough her bag was under the seat in front of me. Luckily the flight attendant moved it this time allowing me to place my backpack under the seat in front of me. By this time my entire back was locked up and there is no position I can sit in that’s comfortable. The plane finally lands and I grimace while putting my backpack on my backpack. Then the lady that’s been sitting next to me asks me to grab her large bag that’s in the overhead bin. It’s embarrassing to say, but I tell her I can’t I have a fractured rib and it’s painful, and she just gives me this “WTF is your problem” stare.\n\n\nEdit: *Please don't ask me about or mention the name of the airline.* ",

Even though we were definitely not the normal crowd for the restaurant (under dressed college kids in a pretty fancy place) he treated us with so much respect and was the best waiter I have ever had.

        "text": "This happened to me and my coworkers a good while back. We were sub-contractors at an industrial plant a good 4 hours drive from our offices (not uncommon in my line of work). This day just didn't go well, which translated to a 15-hour shift, and us leaving the plant at 9h45PM. So where can a a bunch of weary workers can get diner at such an hour. Well, only choice is a popular fast food chain the rules do not allow me to name, so I'll call it Burgers.\n\nWhen we're so far from the office, the company pays for food and lodging, but you must have your receipts. The system we worked out is that the last guy in line pays for everyone, and just puts it in his expenses tab. Keeps receipts to a minimum, less headache for the bean counters, paying is faster... \n\nNow, I already wasn't thrilled about eating at Burgers, and then I see that it's one of those location with touchscreens where you have to input your order, rather than talking to an employee. I absolutly despise these things, because I have yet to use one that has worked perfectly. Sure enough, after everyone has placed their order and I payed with my card, I get a big ERROR when I try to print out the receipt. Well, time to go see a cashier. Luckily, I had the foresight to snap a picture of the order with my cellphone, just in case something like this happened. I also wish to mention that I'm tired, covered in ash and dust, and I just want to get food and a shower and go to sleep.\n\nCashier #1 is apparently very new and doesn't know how to print a receipt yet, so she gets the shift manager. Shift Manager (SM) is slightly younger than me(ME), mid 20s I'd say.\n\nSM: Yes, can I help you\n\nMe: You ordering booth can't print out my receipt. Can you print it for me? It's order 182\n\nSM: Ummmmm.... Yes I can do that.\n\n(SM proceeds to stare at the computer screen like the interface language suddenly turned to Klingon, occasionally pressing it. This goes on for 20 minutes, during which he frequently asks me for my order number, if my order was the small frozen treat, and muttering \"no way, not like this\". I also notice he seems to slur his words a little.)\n\nMe: Ok, you know what. Nevermind, I'll use the picture. I'mma just grab the order (which was sitting there for a while)\n\nSo SM gives us a sorry and a thank you for coming, and we all sit at a booth. My coworker (CW) just in front of me grabs his iced cappuccino, takes a sip and looks like it strangely. \n\nCW: This... tastes like whiskey\n\nMe (jokingly): they probably accidently gave you the shift manager's coffee by accident\n\nI earned a couple of laughs for this joke, but no sooner did they die out that we noticed the manager, behind his counter, with an identical iced cappuccino. He takes a sip from it, then another, and an other, looking more and more concerned, then disappears in the back with it. Cue the guys of us giving each other the \"Did you see that shit?\" look.\n\nTL: DR Shift manager has trouble printing out a receipt, and looks and acts somewhat intoxicated. My coworker's ice cappuccino tasted like booze, and we spy the manager drinking for an identical cup... Hey, I guess if I were 25-ish and stuck at 10pm at that dead end job, I'd be drinking too.... just not so close to a grill and frier....",

        "text": "Last week, when I went to a nearby coffee shop (inside and not the drive-through) I saw a customer getting very angry and borderline aggressive with a worker there. His order of coffee was taking too long, and he started get VERY pissed off at the worker. He was yelling, and at one point he even took out his phone and started recording her in order to \"expose\" and humiliate her. I think he was planning to post it online or something. The worker was very calm and she was just like \"sir, this is not our policy\". I was seconds away from calling the cops on that asshole, but someone beat me to it. Five minutes after the guy finally got his order and left, I saw a police officer walk in. I spoke to the worker at the counter and told her I was so sorry she was treated that way. She just laughed and dismissed it, like it wasn't a big deal to her (or so I thought).\n\nLater when I was sitting at one of the tables using my laptop, this same worker comes up to me and sits down at the table. She is in tears and extremely upset about the incident. She thanked me for my compassion and for reaching out to her. She told me she was very embarrassed about what happened. Before she went back to her shift, I gave her a hug and she called me her new friend. I was extremely touched by the whole situation. I never thought a normal day at a coffee shop would've turned into this.\n\nI felt really bad for her too because she's a new worker there, but I'm really glad I was able to make someone's day though. Had I not been there, she would've spent the rest of the day feeling like shit because no one would've reached out to her. Other people were there and saw the incident, but they didn't seem to care and just kind of dismissed it.",

        "text": "I've been lurking in here for awhile and I remembered an interesting situation that I wanted to share. We're traveling back several years to when I was 17, but this was the highlight of about three negative experiences as a customer in my life.\n\nOn three consecutive visits to the Golden Arches one week, I stopped at the fast food place for a quick bite. I wasn't eating fast food all that often, but I'd had cravings for a chicken sandwich and minimal self control. It's worth mentioning that the first time was a commute home from work, and the second and third times were with my then-boyfriend, so I had an unintentional witness to this travesty.\n\nI pull up into the drive thru and speak when prompted. I ordered a chicken sandwich with extra mayo; reason being, this location was stingy with condiments as if it came out of their paychecks or something. It was mildly inconvenient, but this location was on the route home.\n\nI pulled around to the window to pay and moved onto the pickup window. Yeah, some places actually still have separate windows for that. I collect my order and pull out of the drive thru, unwrapping my sandwich while I wait for a Samaritan to let me merge into traffic. As I was about to bite into it, I smelled something odd. I lifted the bun and there was a regular serving of tartar sauce on my chicken sandwich. Certainly not mayo and certainly not double the amount. I hadn't even noticed the person who'd stopped to let me merge. I merged, but took a left instead and basically did a 180 back into the lot and drive thru, right to the payment window.\n\nSame guy. Tall and with a distinctive lipstick stain tattoo on his neck. I politely informed him of the error. \"Oh my bad, uh...just pull up to the next window.\"\n\nA minute passes and someone hands me another sandwich and I attempt to hand them the error-wich to dispose of, but they already disappeared. Now I have my correct sandwich (I looked before leaving) and a tartar sauce chicken sandwich. I don't remember what I did with it, but I probably either tossed it or gave it to my dad when I got home.\n\nNext day, same thing. I ordered a chicken sandwich with extra mayo. I was with my then-boyfriend on our way to his house after a day of errands. He ordered his and he pulled around to the window. The same guy was working. How odd. We pay, pull up to the next window. We get our order and go back to his house. We sit down to eat and watch HGTV (our weird routine) and lo and behold, there is tartar sauce on my sandwich again.\n\n\"What the actual fuck?\" He looks over in astonishment, remembering what I had told him about the previous day's fiasco. He traded my chicken sandwich for his, which was made correctly, because he wanted to find out what a chicken sandwich with tartar sauce tasted like. His opinion was that it was acceptable but not exciting. Noted.\n\nThe next day was more of a social experiment. We went back to the same place for lunch and placed the same order. The same guy was there. We pay and collect, and I unwrap my sandwich. Tartar sauce. At this point, my boyfriend checked his rearview mirror and literally reversed back to the payment window and tapped. \n\nHe opened the window and my boyfriend did all the talking while I sat there flabbergasted. B is for boyfriend, E is for employee. \n\nB: Hey man, you took my boyfriend's order three days in a row. He asked for extra mayo and you keep putting tartar sauce on it. Who keeps making that mistake?\n\nE: Uh...my bad, man. I don't know how that keeps happening.\n\nB: Well, whether its you or the cooks, I don't know what language barrier issues you guys have in here, but extra mayo does not rhyme with tartar sauce!\"\n\nEmployee just stood there and stared. I have to say, my boyfriend was laughing the whole time, so he wasn't really reaming the guy out or anything, but he was definitely a little peeved, as was I. Anyway, we got the right order and never went back to that location until a few months later. I never did see that lipstick stain tattooed employee again, but nor did I receive tartar sauce on my chicken sandwich again.\n\nI was never really mad, just vexed and confused. I still don't know what tartar sauce on a chicken sandwich tastes like for myself.\n\nTL;DR - Golden Arches employee (whether it was the kitchen staff or order taker, I still don't know) continuously messed up my order by swapping out mayo for tartar sauce.",

        "text": "I went away with my Husband and child, to a famous UK attraction, known for its theme park and piers.  \n\nWe had a fantastic day and decided to have a nice bite to eat before heading back to the hotel room. We opted for a famous pizza place. When we entered it was fairly busy, nothing too crazy so we decided to stay.\n\nOur server greeted us and introduced himself as James (not his real name), gave us our menus and left us so we could read over the menus. In the time of us entering and reading the menu, a mad rush had started. James came back, looking very flustered but maintained his professionalism whilst taking our order. \n\nWe had asked for the starters too arrive with the mains, and after 40 minutes of waiting and watching servers running around like crazy, I spotted James emerging with what looked like part of our order. I couldn't contain my excitement at seeing my food, and next thing I knew he had somehow managed to drop my pizza. It was all in slow motion as I witnessed my pizza slip of the tray and just drop to the floor. I was pissed, I was extremley hungry and had just witnessed my food hit the floor, but I let it go because it was an accident and shit happens. \n\nJames immediately apologised and offered us extra sides free on the house. We waited another 15 minutes before our food was served. Whilst enjoying the food, we couldn't help but feel sorry for all the servers as they was rushed off their feet, with the customers moaning at any given chance. James appeared once we had finished and asked if we would like some dessert. I kindly rejected his offer and told him it was a bit too busy for our liking. He nodded in agreement and asked if there was anything else he could do for us. My husband requested a manager, his face dropped and he walked off to get the manager. The manager approached our table with his best \"I'm so sorry\" face whilst the server stood in the background looking nervous.\n\nManager - I would like too sincerely apologise....\n\n\nHusband - Can I just stop you there\n\n\n\n**Manager looked a bit shocked and confused**\n\n\n\nHusband - We don't want an apology. We would like to tell you how amazing James has been tonight as our server. \n\n\n\nThe Manager looked genuinely shocked and was not prepared for this conversation, he was expecting to deal with shouty customers and have to grovel. \n\n\n\nHusband - Even though you was extremley busy, James was professional and didn't forget about us once. My wife's pizza was dropped and straight away he apologised, sorted out extra sides for us all and remained calm through it all. \n\n\nMe - He's been nothing but the perfect server. \n\n\nManager - That is amazing too hear after the evening we have had, if you give me just one moment.\n\n\nThe manager walks towards the James, his face turning from nervous to genuine happiness, the manager picks something up and puts it down on the table.\n\n\nManager - this is our website for the online survey, if you could fill it out with everything you have just told me that would mean a lot. Thankyou very much.\n\n\nAs we started getting ready too leave, James comes over to thanks us, and said it had meant a lot that someone had appreciated his hard work and handed us a box of fresh warm cookies and said \n\n\" I know you didn't want dessert because it was busy, so I've packed them to go for you\".\n\nPleasure was all ours, James!

He told my dad about his current life, and how my dad was the best teacher he ever had. He said that he owes dad a lot, because as a teacher, he did more than just teaching mathematics. \n\nI live in a small town so this encounter was not very unlikely. Yet my dad is an high school math teacher and he used to teach at a school with many troubled teens, so the fact that he made it out of the streets was a very valuable information for dad, and I am so happy for his student.",

But, as a sit here just chilling in my car on my phone I watch like 10 other cars come up and get pissed that they can't order. Like dude calm the fuck down and stop honking at them they aren't even open yet. Just because you think they should be open doesn't mean they are going to be. Just makes me laugh at the stupidity and, feel bad for the employees.\n\nUpdate: Got my burger! It was fanfuckingtastic. I ended up waiting a total of 45 minutes since I got there since I waited for them to open and they had to take like 6 minutes to make the burger (I know crazy right? Right after they open they dont have everything ready to go at a moment's notice! SARCASM). Maybe it's just because I have worked in many food service places including another location for this drive in but I still dont understand why people flip out over having to wait. If you are that hungry go somewhere else. I'm lazy and hungry and perfectly fine waiting. Guess I'm the weird one. \n\nMy husband pointed out after I got home that it's just like the cheeseburger song from veggietales. Thanks to that I have had it stuck in my head all day. :p",

        "text": "This happened shy of a week ago, while my close friend and I were out on a shopping expedition, and it was one of the strangest experiences with food service staff I've ever had!\n\nThe mall we visited was a large outdoor complex, and we had been out for a long time, doing a **lot** of walking in the hot sun. As we made our 3rd pass by one of the main plazas, we decided to stop in to a chicken place that graced that particular area. We were hot and tired and nothing sounded quite as good as a box of nuggets and a cold lemonade.\n\nWe entered the restaurant, and 3 of the 4 cashiers were busy with customers, the one available cashier, who happened to be the manager, politely greeting us as we came in. He was a tall guy in his 30s or so, with piercing blue eyes and a crooked toothy grin, but he seemed very friendly. My friend stood back from the counter examining the menu options, and I approached the cashier to order. He watched me come up, smiling all the while.\n\nWhen I reached him, he continued to look at me, smiling for a little too long before simply greeting me with \"Hello.\" His voice was oddly low and almost predatory.\n\n*Ok...* I thought, and I returned his smile and greeting, and after another lengthy pause (all the while staring) he asked me what I would like to order. I asked for just some nuggets and a small lemonade, and he quickly offered a meal deal with fries and a large drink for an extra 50 cents. Being whooped from the heat and hungry from the aromas at this point, I thought *why not?* and accepted the offer enthusiastically. He chuckled and shook his head in the fashion that you do when someone you find cute does something funny, and sighed \"Yeah I bet you'd like that huh?\"\n\nThat made me more nervous and uncomfortable, and his incredibly slow display of getting my drink (all while still looking at me and smiling) made me all the more uneasy. When he finally brought me my drink, I took it with a nod, and pulled out my card to order.\n\nBut instead of telling me my total and asking me to swipe my card like cashiers usually do, he just stood there and looked at me and kept smiling. He would nod his head and chuckle nervously as he stared at me, and I did my best to return his gaze and smile, but his face turned a steady red and his lips twitched and he seemed to have trouble finding words. He mumbled a how's-your-day-going as we waited, although the cash register had rung up my total and the card reader bleeped for my card, and we had no reason to lolligag. *I just want to get my nuggets and this guy is trying to flirt!* I whimpered internally. By this time my friend had ordered and finished up and was waiting next me for us to finish, and she was watching with almost equal discomfort.\n\n\"I like your shirt\" he stuttered suddenly. I was *really* uncomfortable at this point, but I managed a smile and nod. He continued to stare, pretty intensely, and after a few moments, started louder, \"I said I like your shirt.\"\n\nNow I was wearing the plainest black shirt this side of the Mississippi, what the hell was he complimenting it for. I forced a \"thanks\" before holding up my card and asking if I could pay for my food. His smile faltered and he nodded, wrapping up the transaction. I quickly put away my wallet and gathered my stuff, but before I could move away he asked if I wanted some dipping sauce. *If I get it now I can get out faster* I figured, so I accepted.\n\nHe nodded and smiled and moved ***so slowly***, lightly rummaging around other registers and peeking around the counter space and wringing his hands and ***nodding and smiling*** at me all the while. I wasn't sure if I wanted to hide or scream. He finally brought me my two packets of sauce, and hesitantly placing them in my hand he wished me a good day. I smiled (probably too much out of relief) and thanked him and bid him a good day as well, to which he responded \"Thanks,\" and watched my friend and I move to the other end of the counter to wait.\n\n\"Oh my god\" my friend puffed, making me turn and steal a glance back at him to find that he was *still staring*. He locked eyes for a split second and he waved while calling out \"bye\", like I was his friend at recess and we were returning to our separate classes. I quickly spun around and busied myself putting my straw in my drink and fixing my bags. After a couple minutes they called my name for my nuggets and when I turned to get them he was still staring and smiling and was now standing near the area of the counter where you go to get your food. I rushed to the counter and practically ripped the bag from a poor kid employee's hand, the cashier's stare burning into my very soul, before ushering my friend out the door. He watched us go the whole way while sauntering back to his register, and leaned over it some ways to keep watching us.\n\nI don't think I'll be returning to that establishment anytime soon...",

        "text": "Hello all, \nI've been a lurker for a while to this sub. Though I don't work in retail myself I always love reading the stories and usually walk away with a new perspective on retail. However, last night I had an encounter in which I believe to be subtly rude at a local chain open 24 hrs. To give you a quick rundown, a friend of mine and I used to play call of duty Black Ops zombies in our high school days. Now, a lot of time has passed and we're much older. To bring back the nostalgic feelings of our youth, we decided to pick up Call of Duty Black ops 3 and download the zombie map pack. We are not hardcore gamers, we never were. We're just two guys who work fulltime jobs who wanted a quick blast from the past and to reminisce on our younger days. \n\nSetting the Scene:\nMe (Myself)\nCF (Cod Friend from High School)\nE1( Employee 1)\nE2 (Employee 2)\n\n*Myself and CF approaching the two employees requesting them to assist us*\n\n\nMe &gt; “Hello, can you unlock the game case for us? We’re trying to Purchase a game”\n\n\nE1 &gt; “Sure let’s head that way”\n\n\n*E1 and E2 follow behind us snickering as they have the following exchange*\n\n\nE1 &gt; “I bet they’re getting Call of Duty”\n\n\nE2 &gt; “Haha you’re probably right we’ll see”\n\n\n*Arriving at the game case*\n\n\nCF &gt; “We’d like a copy of Call of Duty Black ops 3 please”\n\n\nE2 &gt; *Laughing in a hysterical manner* “E1 you were so right they are getting Call of Duty” \n\n\nI wanted to ask why they made this accusation. I felt oddly ashamed in the moment and almost walked away from the scene but purchased the game and walked out with my head down. I know this story isn’t outrageous but I felt like I was judged for something that should be irrelevant. I should be able to freely purchase a game without being placed in a set demographic by employees. Granted, my friend and I still had a great time when we arrived home I just still feel a little upset by the situation.\n\nTL;DR went to store and requested help buying a game. Employees made a joke saying they bet we were purchasing Call of duty which is what we were getting. They laughed as they sold us the game \n",

One of the restaurants features a 5 course meal with a dinner theatre where the chef comes out and demonstrates how he made each course. Like Food Network.\n\nWe went the day before yesterday and we loved it. We went again last night as the had different chefs and a new menu.\n\nThe waiters explain how it all works when you sit down.\n\nCue last night with me and waiter (W).\n\nW: Welcome to [restaurant]. Is this for your first time here?\n\nKnowing he wants to give his rehearsed speech I just reply, no we came here last night.\n\nW: So this is your first time at the restaurant?\n\nMe: No we ate here last night.\n\nW: But it is your first time here, at the restaurant?\n\nMe: No. We came here last night.\n\nW: So this is your first time here at the restaurant?\n\nMe: Sure.\n\nHe then proceeds to give us his speech. Probably partially language barrier and partially training that he needed to tell us how everything works.\n\nWe thanked him and just giggled after he finished and left. Started to feel like an Abbot and Costello routine.",

        "text": "I got my very first fillings (composite) in my back molars last September. I had a feeling something was wrong with the fillings on one side of my mouth since they were extremely sensitive and didn't get better even months later, but the fillings on the other side were fine.\n\nRecently, I've started feeling sharp pains in the teeth with the \"bad\" fillings whenever I bite down on even soft things like bread, so I decided to schedule a dentist's appointment. My dentist has been the same since I was little, so he's getting close to retirement age (and is already semi-retired) and only comes into his office on Wednesdays, so I knew I'd have to get an appointment after 6 so that I could go after work.\n\n(for the record, yes, I know I need to change dentists soon, but it's not a priority for now)\n\nI called the office on Tuesday (the 17th) to schedule an appointment for the following Wednesday (the 25th) and the receptionist said she could give me a 6:20 PM appointment since 6 wasn't possible for me. I agreed and figured that was the end of that.\n\nThen I got my confirmation email today, which said my appointment was at 6. I stepped out of work and called them to ask to be moved back to my original appointment and a different receptionist picked up (who will be referred to as R while I will refer to myself as M).\n\nR: \\[Dentist's company name\\].\n\nM: Hi, my name is \\[name\\] and I have an appointment for next Wednesday at 6:20, but my confirmation email says 6. i just wanted to check why my appointment was moved.\n\nR: Who told you you could have an appointment at 6:20?\n\nM: Uh, the receptionist I spoke to on Tuesday did.\n\nR: Well, we close at 7, so you can't do 6:20. Come at 6.\n\nM: I can't, I have work and it's not possible to make it to your office by then.\n\nR: Well, since we close at 7, \\[dentist's name\\] won't have enough time to work on your teeth if you come in at 6:20. If you \\*really\\* can't make it at 6 \\[note: at this point, I can hear her rolling her eyes through the phone\\], I guess we can do 6:10 or 6:15.\n\nM: I don't know if I can do that...\n\nAt this point, I was fine with either of those options, but I was just angry that she was being rude and wanted to see why 6:15 was so much better than 6:20.\n\nR: Look, \\[dentist's name\\] needs time to work on your teeth, if you come in at 6:15 he'll have 45 minutes and he won't have that kind of time if you come in at 6:20.\n\nM: \\*internally\\* Yeah, that's how math works. He'll have 40 minutes instead of 45. \\*out loud\\* Fine, just give me 6:15 then. Thanks.\n\nR: See you Wednesday.\n\nM: Just to confirm, 6:15, right? Not 6?\n\nR: 6:15. \\*hangs up without a goodbye\\*\n\nHonestly, if I hadn't been suffering from this pain for several weeks now, I might not be as upset about this, but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting to how rude she was or not. Am I crazy?",

        "text": "So I was attending an educational session that took all day and was mandatory about 5yrs ago.  This was in the middle of a large North Eastern City.  They only gave us 30min for lunch so I rushed out to find a nice and fast lunch.  I knew this would be the last chance I would be able to eat for the next 5hrs, and it would also be my first meal of the day.\n\nI quickly find a German/American style pub. It had an upscale feel to it (reclaimed lumber, brass light fixtures, solid oak bar, comfy leather high back bar stools, Edison light bulbs, you get the gist)\n\nI sit at the bar and ask the bartender/server what takes the least amount of time for the kitchen to make; and I explained my situation and stressed the fact that I only had 30min to dine.  The bartender tells me their fried chicken sandwich takes about 15min to make and that it’s “one of his favorites”.\n\nAs an avid Home Cook, I knew he was probably giving me an accurate estimate of the time it would take to make the dish I had ordered (fried chicken is pretty easily made from scratch in under 15min), so I thank him for his help in ordering and tell him I’d like the fried chicken sandwich and a seltzer with lemon; I couldn’t enjoy a beer, as the organizers of the session I was attending would not look favorably on an attendee coming back with beer on his breath.\n\n15min passes and I don’t have my order yet.  I’m not too worried, since I’m a fast eater and can easily scarf my sandwich and fries down in under 5min.  However, I spot a guy who is obviously the chef walk out of the back and approach the bar, in stereotypical chef attire (dirty white-t, crocs, black cloth doo-rag/cap, those baggy pin-stripped chef’s pants, and one of those clear plastic quart containers).  He proceeds to go behind the bar and fill his cup with beer and starts chatting up the obviously out of his league hostess (typical a-hole stance, picture Fonzie “leaning on the wall with his leg crossed” stance), all while enjoying his tasty beverage.  Then he starts joking with the servers and bartender.  This goes on for somewhere between 5-10min.\n\nNow I know that there was probably more than one chef working that day, since the place was of a decent size and was decently busy as well for the lunch hour, but this is not acceptable behavior for any employee, be it FOH or BOH, especially during a busy lunch rush.\n\n\nDuring this time, I had asked the bartender if he knew if my order would be out soon and that I was starting to be very short on time before I had to head back to my session.  He assured me that my order would be out momentarily, every few minutes.\n\n25min after my order: no food?\n\n26min after my order: no food!?\n\n27min after my order: no food!\n\n28min after my order: no food!!\n\n29min after my order: no food!!!\n\nAt this point I’m fed up, tired, and still hungry.  After being strung along for the past 15min, watching other customers who had ordered at the same time as me or after get their food, and watching the chef lolligag around instead of making my food, I call the bartender over and tell him to cancel my order and that I had to leave now.  He apologized for the delay and quickly ran into the kitchen.\n\nAs I reach the threshold of the pub, I hear someone call out “excuse me sir”.  So I turn around and it’s who I assume is the manager (stereotypical approaching middle-aged, portly man wearing dress shirt unbuttoned at the top, without a tie, slacks, and dress shoes).  He is holding a plate with my meal on it and rushing towards me. \n\nHe tells me this is my order and asks if I want it.  I tell him no and reiterated what I had said to the bartender when I first arrived.  He then asks me if I wanted it wrapped up.  I said no again, told him again that I had no time left to eat and that I could not bring this food with me into my session.  I added that I wasn’t going to be paying for the food and that maybe my food would have come out quicker if his chef hadn’t taken a “siesta” during the lunch rush. I turned around and left.\n\nI ran back to the building and suite that my session was in hungry and annoyed. \n\nI had specifically ordered something simple, and easy to quickly make.  I didn’t ask for anything special and I had made it clear that I couldn’t be late for my session.  So my prize for all this was to continue my 10hr day with a stomach that was actively eating itself, with only the look on the manager’s awe-struck face as I walked out the door to keep my spirits up. \n\nIf anyone cares to know, I’ve worked FOH, BOH, for many years during high school and college, and bartended as a second and third job after I graduated.  I know how hard restaurant employees work and so I always tip +20% unless the service is down right intentionally terrible.\n\nThe chef should know better than to act the way he did and the manager shouldn’t have allowed his chef to do what he did.  I always do my best to make the lives of restaurant staff as easy as possible (I don’t send things back, I stack all the empty plates and silverware so that the server/busboy can easily take them away, and I usually don’t sweat the small stuff, but in this incident, I had to put my foot down (literally, I had to beat feet back to my session to make it back on time).\n\n",

The food was great, but one item from my order was missing.  When I contacted Nip to let them know, I figured they’d refund the cost of the item (6.50) in the form of a Nip credit- they’re good like that, and I haven’t had issues in the past...but on this day, for whatever reason , the credits issued were in the amount of nearly 3x the cost of the missing item. It looks like the item, the delivery fee, and the tip I paid were all refunded. I’m not sure if that’s the case, but nobody can tell me it isn’t, and I’m feeling genuinely awful that the driver may have had to eat the refund for the restaurant’s mistake. \n\nI hope this isn’t how Nip works, but if this is the case, I have zero doubt that any food purchased with my ill-gotten gains will probably poison me, or I’ll choke, or some other karmically-fitting end will befall me...",
