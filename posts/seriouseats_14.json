        "text": "\nUPDATE: thank you for all the tips and suggestions! I took all of them and it really helped- added two garden carrots, Parmesan rind, 1/8 teaspoon baking soda, and simmered for two hours. Perfecto!! \n\nAfter a haul of 7 pounds of beautiful tomatoes from the garden (San Marzano, Roma, pineapple, Cherokee purple), I decided to try making sauce from fresh tomatoes using. [this 2014 recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/08/the-best-fresh-tomato-sauce-for-pasta-recipe.html)\n\nCompleted all the steps- though I passed the recipe on to my (very competent) husband to finish as I had to go to class. I left with the tomato paste cooking in the oven, sauce separated and the rest of it cooking on the stove. \n\nAfter getting home I was so excited to try the sauce- but it ended up tasting... off. Way too bright/acidity. No problem, added some butter and olive oil. No dice. \n\nItâ€™s missing the deeper sweet, caramelized notes and umami of good sauce. I want to fix it so all the tomatoes donâ€™t go to waste, but am unsure of what to try next. \n\nAdd canned tomato paste? Cook down on the stove? Welcome your thoughts. \n\nTLDR: fresh tomato sauce tastes too bright/not sweet or layered. Can you help me fix it?",

The yolks **could not** have come out more perfectly - golden, warm, gelatinous wonderfulness - but the whites were a bit of a mess... Watery, runny, oozy, and not at all firm (except for the nice skin on the outside. But they collapsed everywhere as soon as they were peeled.\n\nWe prefer really quite firm whites. And, as we have reached the yolk promised land, we would like to leave those well enough alone. Please help!! All suggestions are good suggestions!!! Thank you!!",

While it thickened slightly, the mixture never tripled or got light and fluffy. I'm not 100% confident in the thermometer I used, so I'm assuming it's that, but anything else to consider that might have gone wrong? The cookies themselves came out great.",

If I do this, I end up with loose ground beef after the first flip. \n\nThe only thing I can think of (and that the writeup doesn't specify) is the grind size. I'm using the medium size die on my meet grinder which has 8mm holes (I think, the labeling is a bit confusing, what it actually says is 5/8mm but it is definitely larger than that, so I think the 5 refers to some other measurement). Do I need to go down to the small size die (4.5 mm)? What can I do to keep my patties together without overworking the meat?\n\n",

        "text": "TBH, I tend to avoid US cookbooks (and Internet recipes) like the plague, as I just can't get my head around / reproducible results with volumetric measurements. Notable exceptions are Modernist Cuisine at Home, Serious Eats, and ChefSteps, but even there I've stayed away from the baking sections, for fear that the ingredients, especially the ones taken for granted, might be too different.  Until I stumbled upon *BraveTart* ... just couldn't resist. ^^\n\nMy first attempt from the book were the Snickerdoodles. Of course, I'd never heard of such a thing, much less seen or tasted it before, but going by pictures &amp; descriptions they failed epically.  \nIt might have been the 30 Â°C ambient temperature -- AC is unheard of hereabouts --, but I managed the temp as best I could and the dough looked fine, even the intermediate stages.  \nIt might have been the oven -- older consumer combi model, quite accurate, less moisture loss than normal, even if it doesn't go beyond 230 Â°C, run in conventional mode (no fan or steam); or baking sheet -- iron oxide coated steel is the norm here.  \nIt might have been the butter, sugar, salt, baking powder, flour, even the cinnamon -- Ceylon instead of Cassia --, as for the rest, see below.  \nAbout the only ingredient I'm reasonably confident in is the large egg, at 60 g incl. shell.  \n\nIn any case, the cookies started to spread a couple of seconds after being put in the oven, tearing all over, especially towards the rims. The original surface, with cinnamon sugar on it, turned out very dark, almost black, with the stark white of the dough in the cracked areas giving an interesting, if unintended, contrast. I turned and reduced temp after just 3 min (and resolved to not preheat the baking sheet for the second batch). The latter was markedly better, as far as colour &amp; cracks went, but still -- no way it'd have lasted 6 min in phase one.  \nMine were slightly domed, not flat, yet the cross-cut looked more like dense bread than soft crumbly cookie.  \nWell, the important thing is the taste, right? Which was very sweet ... and not much else. No two textures (crisp exterior vs gooey interior) in sight. Cinnamon, yes, but not nearly as much as expected. They reminded me of IKEA's oatmeal cookies. Every other bite extremely salty, though that might be intended.  \n\nHere's what's typically available locally:\n\n* butter: typically ~82 % fat, sweet cream, unsalted.  \nSo, 2 % more fat than US butter, but otherwise it should be ok. Should I have replaced part with ... what? to get the fat down? BTW, I've no idea where the notion that European butter is made from soured/cultured cream comes from. I mean, it exists, but it isn't that common.\n\n* sugar: available as course crystals, fine crystals, even finer crystals, very fine ones [used for applications where US/UK  recipes would specify icing sugar, but AFAICT without the corn starch], and an even finer one [professional pastry, confectionery, definitely no starch]. You're spoiled for choice -- unless you want something that isn't white refined beet sugar, that is.  \nSugar should be sugar, but sometimes crystal size / how easily the sugar dissolves does matter and I've no idea what US sugar looks like.\n\n* salt: \"normal\" salt here is iodised table salt with various additives. The Jewish supermarkets have kosher salt, which I used, but no Diamond Crystal. Mine, though quite coarse, clocked in north of 5.5 g for the 1.25 (European) tsp, so I reduced it to 4 g. Still either too much or the wrong kind. Maybe Maldon would work ...\n\n* baking powder: our b.p. is single-acting, yes, but it is not active at room temperature, just in the oven (the acid component is SAPP, the ratio of which to baking soda and corn starch is proprietary), so it's just the second stage of the US double-acting kind and not at all like the US single-acting one. Which is not available for love nor money ... Rigging something up by replacing a scant quarter with single acting b.p. based on cream of tartar &amp; bicarbonate of soda was apparently a mistake.  \n\n* flour: soft, yellow(?) wheat only, primarily classified by ash content. No hard wheat north of Italy, apparently, and red wheat is entirely unknown. AFAICT the recommended Gold Medal all-purpose clocks in at about 10 % protein, I couldn't find the ash content. So I used Marriage's plain flour (UK), but that's still pure soft wheat, not at all malted and yellow-only to boot.  \n\nWhere am I going with this? A post-mortem would be nice, as would an article series on SE on how to adapt (baking) recipes to non-US markets and vice versa. Yes, the core audience is US, but more international readers wouldn't hurt, and after all it goes both ways, opening up foreign recipes to Americans, doesn't it? The Internet at large isn't any help, as most such info on out there is just blatantly wrong. If the SE authors could keep in mind that the most ordinary supermarket ingredient might entirely different or impossible to get elsewhere, even better.\n\n",
