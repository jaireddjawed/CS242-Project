        "text": "A couple months ago, my bf and I were visiting some friends (another couple) in VA and went out to some restaurant for a late dinner. I honestly can't remember the name of the restaurant we went to, but it's probably on par with like a Sapphire Wednesday's or That Vaguely Australian Steakhouse or something, in terms of price and menu options, whatever. \n\nAnyway, on the first page of their drink menu, I see they not only have mojitos; they have strawberry mojitos, which are my favorite! If you've only known my struggle with finding places that can make my favorite cocktail- at least half of the places I've been that serve alcohol either don't have mint and/or fresh strawberries for their bar. So, this was a rare find for me! I'm the only one who even orders alcohol at the table for this meal, and I'm not that bothered because I want my favorite drink if I can order it!\n\nSo it comes out - and my excitement stops with the first sip. It's wrong, the worst attempt at a mojito I've ever experienced. There's barely any mint; the strawberry taste is artificial, there's maybe half a shot of rum in there... based on what I expected and what I read from the ingredients listed, it did not taste like a decent mojito.\n\nI'm also extremely shy and have some social anxiety, don't enjoy confrontation or anything- even though I wanted to say \"This is the worst drink I've ever had\", I didn't want to be /that/ person. So when the server comes up and asks how it is, I'm shyly admitting and struggling to keep eye contact as I say \"I'm sorry, I just don't like it.\" (I'd literally taken two sips)\n\nHe says sorry, and asks if I want to get something else. One of my friends interjects on my behalf and asks if the bartender possibly made a mistake and could try and make me another one (because she knew how much I wanted this particular drink). \n\nThe server scoffs at us and says \"Ha, no, that's not possible. The girl we have here tonight is our best bartender, she wouldn't have made your drink wrong.\" That just made me feel even more disappointed, and even a little pissed. Instead of ordering a different cocktail, I just asked for a water instead. Also, my grilled fish tacos were bland af. Overall, a very disappointing meal; it ruined my mood until I got to pet my friends' dog later that night lol.",

        "text": "So, this happened last weekend.\n\nI like to go to different grocery stores in my city, mostly just for a change of scenery and see what sales they have. In this, I don't always look like the \"kind\" of person who would patron that particular store ( looking like a plain-looking fat chick doesn't win me much fans at the organic grocery store). In that, some people will take one look at me and begin their vocal dissertation on whatever minor political topic happens to be on their mind.\n\nAnyway, I happened to be at a bog-standard grocery store on the otherside of town when this incident happened. I had got a weekly sales flyer in the mail that had an ad for really cheap paper towels, and I was looking to stock up.\nI  had loaded up on paper towels and was perusing the canned food aisle when heard the noise.\n\n*Groaning*\n\nI look down the aisle to see a bearded gentleman giving me the side-eye. He kept shaking his head at the sight of me. \n\nI disregard it since I was about to head another aisle and he seemed involved in the Chunky Chili cans. In so, I turn in the pasta aisle. A few seconds later, I hear it again.\n\n*Groaning*\n\nI see Beardman standing a few feet away.\n\n&gt;\"Why do they liberals like you out anyway? This store is for honest people only.\n\n\n\nI'm confused at this point.\n\n&gt;\"I'm just a random person shopping. Move along, sir\"\n\nI start walking down the aisle, with the intent of checking out and leaving. Beardman decides following me is a good idea.\n\n&gt;\"You can't run from me you fat sow! You can't be spending you money here and corrupting the honest cashiers! [Insert rambling political rant here]\n\nAt this point, I'm trying not to show emotion and I beeline for the checkout. I didn't want to feed his anger. I hoped the sight of other people might deter Beardman.\n\nI reached the checkout and I looked back to see Beardman groaning loudly and staring daggers at me. The cashier took notice and gestured for the bored manager chatting with them. The manager put herself in the sightline of Beardman and just stared.\n\nI managed to check out quickly, and I sped walk for the car. I didn't want Beardman coming after me. In so, I peeled out the lot an into the street.\n\nI don't go to that grocery store anymore.",

My grandma has dementia and she's also a really slow eater. So she was still finishing up her meal as my mom and I packed up our leftovers. \n\nAfter a few minutes, my grandma notices the tip and exclaims to us, \"that is way too high!!\" For some reason my grandma thinks that a tip depends on the amount of customers served. So in her mind we should have only tipped $3. My mom and I calmly explain that the tip is fine and its okay. It seems like she dropped the whole thing until our waitress passed by.\n\nMy grandma flagged her down and told her, \"my daughter is tipping you way too much!!\" I can't remember exactly what the waitress said but she handled it so well. My mom and I were mortified and we kept apologizing. She seemed to understand and still treated my grandma very well. We ended up tipping her the $8 and everything was fine.\n\nI just want to add that some people truly cannot help themselves. Before my grandma was diagnosed, she would have never acted in this way.\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/7x9f91/berated_for_not_ordering_decaf_right/",
        "text": "So, the other day I got berated for ''ordering wrong''. I have a medical condition and unfortunately can only drink decaf (limitedly) now. I initially go through the drive-thru to order, and I specifically emphasize the word **decaf** first, because I'm quite used to ordering this way. I make sure to stress the word decaf due to past incidences. \n\nThe barista hands me my drink but I end up parking and going in because I have some time to kill, so I decide I wanna just sit and do work on my laptop.  I'm enjoying my drink but after a few minutes I realize this was indeed not decaf. I start to feel the familiar pain and discomfort in my body, so I go up to the bar and I casually and *politely* ask, ''hi, this is decaf right?'' \n\nI shit you not, the barista stares me right in the eye for three of the longest seconds of my life, grabs my drink off the counter and says, ''if you wanted it that way, you should've ordered it like that. Next time, say so first.'' I'm a bit taken aback because I've never been corrected this way by a barista before, but I'm also quite sure I ordered decaf. I should note that I've been ordering this way for **months**, it's almost muscle memory at this point. \n\nSo I apologize in typical Canadian fashion and I say, ''um, I'm sorry, but .,, I'm pretty sure I did, but again sorry for the trouble'', being polite the whole way through. She looks at me with the most annoyed face and says, ''No, you didn't. I listened for it and I ran through the recording twice and you ordered regular.'' (Didn't even know you could do that with a drive-thru but sure). \n\nAt this point I'm getting annoyed and embarrassed (and also in physical pain) but my friend, who had been there while I ordered, convinced me to press on the issue. So I say, ''I made sure to say decaf, it's a medical issue and not a preference, do you mind if I hear the recording?'' \n\nShe looks at me, and literally does not answer me, but goes back behind the bar and remakes my drink. Then she says, ''you probably didn't say it loud enough. Always say decaf first (I did?) so we know to mark the cup.'' \n\nI show her my cup where the little x is marked for decaf (which I made sure to check for before drinking). Look on her face was priceless but I didn't even get an apology. I also spent the next few hours in discomfort and had to adjust the timing of my meds for it. \n\n90% sure this barista just didn't care/thought I wouldn't notice, but the stabbing stomach pains I had gave it away. I would've forgiven an honest mistake if she had been nicer about it, too. ",

My Aunt calls and a very polite guy answers, she introduces herself and her situation and the guy on the phone recognizes my Aunt since she was a regular there.

I am in the middle of a PC build and, for those unaware, it is very hard to find decently priced video cards today. \n\nSo I tried my favorite location for PC and electronics. *Tiny store.* This store has been good to me in the past and has, usually, never let me down. \n\nI started off my adventure into *tiny store* like normal. I walked past their warranty department and right into their BYOS department. \n\nI pull a random sales guy. \n\n&gt; $sales guy - Hello sir how may I assist you. \n\n&gt; $me - I am looking for a 1080ti or 2 1070ti cards. What do you have available. I know what your website says, but what do you actually have. \n\n&gt; $Sales guy - We have 10 zotac tri fan models for 850. Those are 1080ti of course. We have 2 EVGA OC 1080TI for 975, 4 MSI blower style for 900 and 2 strix for 1200. \n\n&gt; $ME - Did you purposefully read those off to me in the order you knew I would be most to least interested in?\n\n&gt; $Sales guy - Yes. Yes I did. \n\nWe got to the point where I was about to buy it when I realized my wallet was still in my car. \n\nI go back out to my car, grab my wallet and back inside. The salesman I spoke with was already with another customer. Not a big deal these guys make commission. \n\nI walk over to the next guy I can find, new employee never seen him before. (Yes I shop at *tiny store* in dallas that often.) I go up to him. \n\n&gt; $New guy - Hello sir what can I assist with?\n\n&gt; $Me - I want the zotac 1080TI you have available for 850. \n\n&gt; $New guy - Let me check here. \n\nHe pulls up their sales center and not their stock center page. \n\n&gt; $Me - You wont find it on the sales center. But it is in stock. \n\n&gt; $New guy - We cant sell it if it is not in sales center sir. \n\nLie. Done it a jillion times. \n\n&gt; $ME - Let me speak to your manager please. \n\nHe goes and gets his manager. \n\n&gt; $Manager -  $new guy told me you wanted to buy some video cards that were not on sale?\n\n&gt; $me - Yes You have them in stock according to another salesman. But they are not in sales center.\n\n&gt; $Manager - Right if they are not in the sales center, then we are not allowed to sell it.\n\n&gt; $me - Is that a new policy? When will the card go on sale? I will be here before opening standing in line to give your store money. \n\n&gt; $manager - I have zero knowledge of any cards outside of those 2 1200 dollar 1080TIs. Also we have never been allowed to sell items not in the sales center. \n\n&gt; $Me - I have been shopping here for over 10 years. I have purchased in stock items several times that were not on sale yet. \n\n&gt; $Manager - Then you have had people not do their job correctly then. \n\n&gt; $ME - umm not trying to argue, but you have done this for me before. Four years ago when I built my last system, you sold me the new intel i7 3 days before the sales ad went out. \n\n&gt; $Manager - Sir I believe you are mistaken. You mind telling me which salesman told you about the cards in stock?\n\n&gt; $me - Pfft I aint no snitch. \n\nI walked out and found a sweet deal on an unopened one on ebay for 700.

        "text": "TL:DR is at the bottom.\n\nThis happened about two years ago at a local hospital (somewhat known for accidentally killing patients for little things or mistreating patients). \n\nI used to play a very popular non professional sport that requires skates. I got injured playing and needed knee surgery. My doctor let me know there was a risk of blood clots so they had me take something to reduce the risk. However, during my recovery, the chair I laid in, it was in a bad spot on my recovering leg and I got a blood clot in my calf.\n\nAt my follow up with my doctor, a week after surgery, I explained the pain I felt and he had me go get an ultra sound. They confirmed I had a clot and sent me to the ER for a blood thinner. I was actually in the ER for a very short (surprisingly) amount of time. They gave me a prescription for a starter pack of blood thinner medication and sent me home. \n\nOnce home, I was alone after being dropped off until about 6:30pm which was 4 hours after having my first dose of blood thinner. My husband came home, got the script and went for my medication. We lived 30 mins from everything in every direction so by the time he got to a big name retail pharmacy, it was about 7:30pm. He tried several places to get my script filled and no one had the starter pack and no one would fill a loose order of my prescription because it WASNT the prescription that I was prescribed and the starter pack would take a day or two.\n\nMy husband called the hospital and asked them what to do because I was specifically told not to miss a dose and that the first two weeks were crucial to take each pill each day. They told my husband to bring me back to the hospital if I couldn’t get the medication I needed. So he came home, got me and our 3 year old and headed back to the hospital, 30 mins away. Mind you, I had knee surgery, blood clot and was on crutches. It was very painful.\n\nWhen we arrived to the hospital, my husband dropped me off at the door and I told him to go get cat food so our 3 year old wouldn’t have to go in because it was mid December. The security guard got me a chair and I wheeled up to the nurses sitting there. They asked me why I was there and I told them I had knee surgery and I had a clot.\n\nMe: “My husband was told to bring me back for my next dose, I was here earlier.”\nNurse: “do you know what medication or how many per day?”\nMe: “no, my husband dropped off the script already, I can’t remember, but I was told to come back for more”\nNurse: “well, blood thinners are a one a day, we don’t want to waste your time.”\nMe: “but I was told to come back and get more, I just want to make sure.”\nNurse: “we don’t want to waste your time, it’s a one a day”\nMe: “but I don’t know that for sure”\nNurse: “it’s okay, you can go home”\n\nAt this point, I was pretty much in tears. The other nurse wheeled me to the side, next to a garbage can, pointed where I’m literally staring at a wall. I called my husband and he picked me up and brought me home. I would also like to note that the staff did not ask me my name or any information used to look at a patient file. \n\nThe next morning, my husband leaves at 545am with our 3 year old and he goes to work. I’ll be home alone until 6pm today. This is now the next day and I’m trying to contact the hospital and doctor again. I find out that the medication they gave me is a 2 a day for the first two weeks and 1 a day after that. By the time my husband gets home with my medication, I have missed two doses. \n\nThe next day is Friday and my husband and daughter leave again. When he gets home, he and I decide that I’m in too much pain to watch our daughter that Saturday while my husband is at work so we ask my mom to watch her, my mom is an hour away. For some reason, I ask him to take me and then drive me another half hour to another hospital from the area I grew up in.\n\nWhen we get to the different hospital, I see about 8 people from checking in to getting tested until the final doctor comes in. Each and every person who I interacted with I said:\n\nI’m sorry, I don’t know why I’m here. I’m probably wasting your time. I’m so sorry.\n\nEach person I said this to. \n\nThe final doctor comes in for my results and I start to say I’m wasting their time and the doctor says, “you need to stop saying that, you have two to three blood clots in your lung. Now because you missed two doses of your medication, the clots spread to your lung.”\n\nI end up staying overnight at the hospital on blood thinners and my one month of recovery now becomes three. \n\nHere is a short list of the following issues I was now confronted with:\n\n- I was unable to drive an hour and 15 mins each way to work so I took a LOA and ended up losing my job\n\n- I went through severe depression and because I could not drive, I went through a large loss of friendships with my non pro sport that I played.\n\n- I was close to becoming addicted to the pain killers I was given because I was depressed and “wanted to feel something other than the emptiness of having no friends”\n\n- Absolutely none of my teammates or friends visited me the entire time during my recovery\n\n- I gained a ton of weight because I was terrified to even walk up my stairs for the three months I was on blood thinners. \n\nI did try to report the incident to the hospital but I was never called back. I spoke to three lawyers about my problem and I was basically told a few things. 1. I didn’t die so the case wouldn’t be as strong and 2. This hospital has too many local ties, I would never win. I did see a family suing the same hospital due to a family member passing away after being sent home with the wrong prescription and the medication not being able to be filled because they got discharged late at night. \n\nBesides my medical problems, my husband and I went through a large amount of life changes in a short time. His loss of job resulted in filing bankruptcy (also student loans), we gave up our house (also rented it to people who destroyed it), my entire vintage video game collection was stolen, we moved 10 hours from Family and somewhat lived miserably trying to help a family member before we moved 10 hours back. \n\nI’m now, two years later, finally getting back to the gym to try to stop the weight I’ve gained. I’m very competitive and enjoy team sports so it’s a difficult road with an injured knee that I’m worried about injuring again. \n\n\nTL;DR: I had knee surgery, got a blood clot, went back to the hospital for medication...hospital staff turned me away without checking my file or asking my name and I missed doses of crucial medication which ended up with pulmonary embolisms and a snowball of depression, loss of quality of life, etc. ",

        "text": "This happened a few weeks ago when my parents came to visit me. There's a Chinese restaurant that we'd been to before offering gluten free food, usually everything except the crispy dishes.  I'm Coeliac, and so is my father, so finding places like that are rare.\n\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant it had changed. The fish tanks were empty, but the menu still offered \"pick your own\" fish. There was only one other occupied table on a Monday night. \n\n\n  I ordered the Mongolian Lamb, which I had ordered before and was fine. The waiter came back and said that the chef said he couldn't do it gluten free. I asked him to give me a list of gluten free dishes, and ended up with a handwritten list of \"safe\"  ingredients instead.\n\n\nSo we have to search through the menu reading every item, and constantly have to ask the waiter to leave because it's difficult to find anything. I ordered the pork ribs, and despite it being on the list, it's not GF. The next time, I pick two options. My first preference isn't safe, but the second one was. All this took half an hour, multiple trips by the waiter, and I basically just wanted to leave.\n\n\nI ended up with a generic yellow curry. :(",

The waiter was apologizing, and they were laughing, saying \"Hey - it worked out fine. Best deal in town!\"\n\nI told my husband that the waiter must have gotten the order wrong. It's the policy there to fix it, but let them keep the wrong pizza since they would just throw it away anyway.\n\nJust then our waitress came with our pizza. There were 2 pieces missing. She said \"I'm so sorry! Some pieces slid off when they were transferring it to the plate. A new pizza is cooking for you right now, but meanwhile you can start eating this one!\"\n\nLol...as the guy next to us said...Best deal in town!",

        "text": "This past summer my family and I decided to go on a trip to an amusement park in our state. The group consisted of my mom, my sister, my two year old niece, and me.\n\nWhile we were driving, we decided to stop and get some breakfast at Large Male Child. We promptly get sat down at a table near a couple of other groups. There’s our group, a family behind at another table, and two older couples at a booth next to us. \n\nNone of us have seen our waitress, and it’s been about fifteen minutes. My sister goes and talks to the host, who immediately takes all of our drink orders. When she brings the drinks, she screws all three tables up, even giving some drinks to other tables. We decide to be patient, and the issue is fixed.\n\nMeanwhile, we still haven’t seen our waitress, so the host takes our food orders as well. I ordered apple pancakes, my mom ordered pancakes for my niece and herself, and my sister gets biscuits and gravy. A half an hour later, some of our food finally comes out. This was the first time we actually saw our waitress. My mom’s pancakes are super flat and cold, she brought two orders of biscuits and gravy (important later), and my pancakes haven’t even been started yet.\n\nAt this point my mom is getting pretty irritated, she used to be a server and holds some expectations from servers because of it. We think, at least they brought out another serving of biscuits and gravy, and the waitress said we wouldn’t be charged for it since we didn’t order it.\n\nAt this point I’m listening in at the other tables to see if they are experiencing bad service as well. The family behind us got all the wrong food and had to wait for it to be fixed. That’s when I look over to the two couples next to us. They all have their food except for one man. That’s when I heard that his biscuits and gravy haven’t come out yet. The waitress gave us his food, and still haven’t gone over to fix it and make sure he gets another.\n\nMy pancakes finally come out, but they don’t have the cinnamon apple sauce like they were supposed to. At this point, our waitress is being rude every time someone tells her that something is wrong. So she rolls her eyes and takes my plate away to be fixed. Now my mom is livid, because you can make mistakes, sometimes you have off days, but you shouldn’t act rude to a customer.\n\nMy pancakes were finally fixed, and my mom asks for a manager. The other two tables agree. The waitress huffs, but eventually goes and gets the manager, who was completely unapologetic and not very helpful. I know at this point, my mom is about to blow, so I take my niece outside with my sister to get her strapped into the car.\n\nWhen I mom did come out, she said she really did try and stay calm. She was paying the bill, and just wanting to get out of there as fast as possible. That’s when the manager and waitress DEMANDED she pay a 20% tip. My mom basically said “Oh hell no, your tip is going to be an online review. Have a nice day.” and she walked out.\n\nWe heard later that the particular location we went to is infamous for terrible service. We now tell everyone going that way to not stop at the Large Male Child in that city.",

        "text": "So there may be a few plotholes to this story as it happened when i was around 13-14 and I may have forgotten some things. This happened the year Spiderman 3 came out because I remember seeing it before we went here.\n\nSo anyway there was a pub that rented out their kitchen. in the town over from ours (about 30km) that we went to regularly at this time. They told us that they would be having a mothers day special where mothers will eat cheaper and get free desert. My mother decided to go and invite the whole family.\n\nSo about 14 of us walk in at 6:10 PM and order our food and sit down. My mother, auntie, and grandmother all order the steak. There’s not many people in the place to my memory except a woman from our town who my mother doesn’t get along with.\n\nSo everyones food comes out in 25 minutes except my for the three mothers. 20 minutes later a girl from the kitchen comes out and says that they are out of steak. And the three instead order chicken. The same girl comes out 15 minutes later and say they’re out of chicken. At this point everyone else had finished their food and were looking at their watches and the mothers themselves were talking about leaving but the waitress insisted that the food was on its way. \n\nAfter yet another 20 minutes the entire kitchen staff walked out to the table and announced that they were out of whatever food they had ordered next and had instead cooked pork. No one at the table liked pork. my mother said “are you serious?”\n\nSo this argument ensued and one of the waitresses stepped forward and said something like “I’m sorry you’re upset but we’re doing the very best we can and you’re being very rude by arguing with us”.\n\nThe argument continued until the woman I mentioned before walked over and said “Id just like to let you know that i really enjoyed my food” in a very sarcastic way. The staff then thanked her and said “it’s good to see that someone appreciates good service”.\n\nAt that point my mother was livid and was getting ready to go and my grandmother said that she’d take the dessert to go. The staff went back into the kitchen and returned 5 minutes later to say they were out of cheesecake and everyone groaned and laughed.\n\nThe guy who owned the actual pub had heard everything and gave the mothers some free jim beam cans and the last thing we heard as we left was him yelling at the kitchen staff.\n\nWhen we got home my mother made some vegemite sandwhiches and wrote a three page complaint letter. Safe to say, we never went back.\n\n\n\n[EDIT]  ok so for some reason a lot of people here are blaming my mother and saying she was being rude. Idk why you think that letting someone wait over an hour for food that’s not coming and then cooking something without asking on mothers day is nothing to get upset about but whatever.\n\nMy mother only got upset after the third time this happened and the rest of the time she was calm and patient. The staff were unprepared and incompetent.",

We sit and i chat for a minute with some of my friends from school who were waiting for their food. Waitress comes after a slightly uncomfortable wait. She listens to our drink order. \nBefore i continue i know that my family can be extremely difficult to serve. Not because we are rowdy but because there are 8 of us and 5 of us are younger than 10. I'm 17 and my parents are early 30's. One brother has a dietary restriction whetr he cant drink dark soda and im pregnant so i also refrain from dark soda. \nWaitress takes our drink order. Writes nothing down. All our drinks are wrong. It was sprite and doctor pepper but what made it confusing was the girls wanting Dr. P. Boys wanting sprite. Me wanting sprite adults Dr. P. I'll admit we gave her the order in a slight chaos but again she wrote nothing down. \nShe also had an attitude and would roll her eyes often. \nPizza took forever to reach us and when it did it was again the wrong order. We ate it because we were hungry and the only thing wrong was type of crust anyway. So as we are eating we needed several refills. Waitress never comes. Avoids eye contact. Doesn't even come to check on us. My step dad stares at her do nothing for 15 mins. Finally he gets up walks over to her and ask s for a refill. The machine is behind the register. Otherwise we would get it ourselves. He does that with all our drinks. She didn't apologize for not doing anything. She didn't even care that she was being rude. She received no tip obviously and tried to make a comment about it. Idk what happened all ik is my step father handed me the keys to the truck and told me get the kids out of there asap. He stayed inside and came out ten minutes later. Won't tell anyone what happened. Won't answer any questions. ",

        "text": "First time poster, sorry for formatting (mobile), etc. Just a bad experience with a rude waitress &amp; a stupid me. It's also long so sorry for that.\n\nI was out of town on business in a downtown area, able to walk to work. Walking back to hotel I pass a sushi place with a sign that says \"Half off sushi after 4pm\". I had a long day so I'm exhausted and I decide I'll order it to go &amp; eat in my room.\n\nAfter my workout, I run up to my room &amp; phone the sushi place. (SideNote: I've got a workout high so I'm kind of out of it). I told the lady what I wanted &amp; she goes \"Oh, you know it's only half-off if you dine in?\" and I realize I had read that. I say \"Oh sorry. Do you have any open seats at the bar?\" She says they do and to come get a seat.\n\nWhen I get there I realize that it's a \"nice clothes\" place and it's packed &amp; people are waiting. My anxiety goes through the roof at this point because I'm in my workout clothes. There's a bar lining the right side of the place with the sushi being made &amp; that's all i can see from the little waiting area, but it looks full. I wait for a few moments &amp; a hostess walks towards me.Im Me, she's H. \n\nMe: \"Hi, I just got off the phone with someone and they said there was seating at the bar? It looks full though so should I wait?\" \nShe kind of looks at me strangely but turns her head to look around the corner.\nH: \"Uhm yeah, looks like there's one seat open down at the very end, you can sit there\" and points down the way.\n\nI walk down &amp; then I see another bar catty-cornered to the sushi bar &amp; question if she meant there, but I only see one seat in between two women that looks taken so I sit at the very end of the sushi bar. I'm sitting there feeling awkward, there's no menu &amp; several workers look at me weird. I'm getting worried I sat at the wrong place but I decide to settle in &amp; wait for the guy in front of me making sushi to say something to me. Cue rude waitress who comes up to my side. She's W.\n\nW: \"Um, I'm sorry but you can't just seat yourself here.\" \nI turn to her, I can feel myself blush, &amp; my mind gets all flustered. \nMe: \"Im sorry, the lady told me to sit here, where should I go?\" \nW: \"Um, what lady? This isnt a seat yourself place.\"\nMe: \"Oh uh the lady at the front, she had a long ponytail. She told me to sit at the very end of the bar and I didn't see any open seats besides right here so I thought she meant here. Where should I go?\" \nW: \"Well as I said, you can't sit here. The bar is over there.\" She points to the \"actual\" bar, throws her hair over her shoulder and walks away. \n\nI look at it and it's still full but I stand up and walk over. I then see that there's one chair on the left side hidden in an alcove. You couldn't have seen it from where me &amp; the H were standing. I feel extremely idiotic and I take a seat. I look at the bartender and I smile and kind of laugh and say \"Is this the end of the bar?\" He looks at me and goes \"what?\" And I realize how stupid I sounded so I said nevermind &amp; he hands me a menu. He continues to look at me strangely &amp; then goes \"So anyone joining you?\" And I shake my head no... there's no other seats around me... he laughs at me &amp; walks away. Took me 10 minutes to order a beer and another 15 to order food because he was ignoring me.\n\nSo I messed up but they were all so weird &amp; rude to me it really was extremely awkward and honestly if I wasn't so tired &amp; hungry I would have left. Hands down the worst experience atmospherically I've ever had. \n\n",

        "text": "I was lurking on this subreddit and thinking I very rarely have any bad retail experiences and then I remembered why I don't like going into arts and crafts stores.\n\nI was about five years old and my parents had taken me to a certain popular arts and crafts store starting with the letter 'M' while they were looking for a photo frame or something (I was a very oblivious child and grew up to be a very oblivious adult). Usually when they took me to stores when I was little, either my mom or my dad would take me to an aisle that would entertain me (books, toys, etc.) while the other parent would do the actual shopping.\n\nIn this instance, it was the hand puppet aisle and my parents were only a couple aisles over because the photo frames or whatever things they were looking for were nearby. I noticed that kids who had been in the puppet aisle before me had just pulled puppets off the shelves and racks and thrown them to the floor so the floor was covered in puppets. I've always been very naturally organized, so little five-year-old me thought it'd be nice to start folding and putting the puppets back on the shelves to help out the employees.\n\nAnd then the shrieking banshee (AKA one of the store employees, denoted as E) descended on me (denoted as M).\n\nE: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!\n\nM: Um. Cleaning up?\n\nE: WHY DID YOU KNOCK ALL OF THESE OVER?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!\n\nM: These were already on the floor when I got here.\n\nE: A LIKELY STORY! WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?! I'M GOING TO GET YOU BANNED FROM THE STORE, I HATE CUSTOMERS LIKE YOU!\n\nNow at this point, my parents are coming over because obviously they can hear the screeching two aisles away and they get into an argument with the employee (which I don't remember because I was in hysteric tears at this point and just wanted to go home, so my mom took me out to the car while my dad stayed and demanded to see the manager). Eventually the manager came out, talked to my dad, checked the security video, and saw that we were telling the truth.\n\nAccording to my dad, he went back a week later and the manager happened to see him and told him she had fired that employee because this was the third time she'd been caught screaming at a child playing in the puppet aisle.\n\nAs for me, I still feel anxious going to an arts and crafts store and haven't set foot in that particular chain since then, and I'm 23 now.\n\nTL;DR Don't scream at children trying to be helpful, it scares the shit out of them and discourages them from wanting to be helpful in the future.",

We got there a bit after the lunch rush. We're kind of chatting as we get seated, thank the hostess and all that.\n\nWe couldn't even open our menu before our waiter was right there. \n\n\"Hi! What are you drinking? And are you ready to order?\"\n\n\"Oh! Um, we haven't looked yet.\" but we order our beverages, which were out in about thirty five seconds. We smiled, thanked the man, and then took a few sips.\n\n\"Okay, so how about that food order!\" he prompted.\n\"I need a minute.\" I smiled tightly. I don't like being pushed. The restaurant was not busy, it wasn't like they needed the table in ten seconds or anything.\n\nTwo minutes later, he comes back, pen and pad. \"So what'll it be?\"\n\nWe were ready then, and he goes to put in our order. We keep talking, although we were starting to get a little uncomfortable. \n\nLickety split, the guy drops off our orders *with* the check. I've never had that happen in a sit down restaurant before. I stared at it for a second, and my friend tucked it under his plate.\n\n\"Ignore it, eat your lunch.\" and we tuck in.\n\nEvery minute and a half, this guy was coming around. \"Ready for me to take that check? Ready to pay? I can take your card right up.\"\n\nFinally, after a few rounds of this, he comes up and goes \"Look, I'm about to clock out, and I want my tip.\"\n\nA tip, you say? I do make it a habit to tip generously. But this guy had just made us so uncomfortable. So pushy. So rude. What if we had wanted dessert? He didn't even ask!\n\nSo I pulled out my card, paid, and didn't even bother with a tip. He gave me the darkest look and stomped away. We did end up ordering dessert, and had a lovely waitress wait on us then. Guess what? She got the tip that would have gone to the first guy.\n\nSeriously, I understand you live on tips. It sucks, I get it. I have tons of family who work those jobs. I'm sorry. I am not giving you a tip for making me feel so crappy, though.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer/comments/7wmevz/my_customer_service_experience_with_museum_in_nyc/",
        "text": "So a museum in NYC, which I will not name, had a deal for about a month where prices were reduced due to parts of the museum being closed for renovation of a new show opening. It's usually very expensive so I marked in my calendar the last day for the deal so I didn't miss it. Their phone message stated that Students were $10 \"until Friday, February 9th\". I even called to clarify this date beforehand and was told the same thing, it's \"until February 9th\".\n\nGreat! So the morning of Friday, Feb 9th, I realized it was the last day and made plans to go. I had a funny feeling in my stomach though and decided to call and totally make sure the deal was still there. I called and spoke to a gentleman with this exchange taking place:\n\nMe: Hi, i'm planning to come to the museum today. Student's get a ticket for $10 still, is that correct?\n\nHim: Well, no. That deal was in place because parts of the museum were closed while opening a new show. That show opened today so tickets are the usual price.\n\nMe: I understand why they were reduced but according to your phone message, which I just heard, these reduced prices are \"until Friday, February 9th\".\n\nHim: Well, \"until\" doesn't include the day.\n\nUh-Oh.\n\nWe went back and forth with him explaining again WHY they were reduced in the first place and me explaining that that is all fine and dandy but \"until\" includes the day. He wouldn't budge.\n\nA bit of back-story. This museum is closed Thursday's. So according to that, the last day for the deal would've been Wednesday February 7th. Hmm. What it felt like was that:\n\nA) the person who made the message messed up  \nB) the new show opened earlier than expected? \nC) Nah that can't be the case, show openings at big museums have set dates months in advance.\n\nI tried asking him for a manager (none were available), I called the box-office (no-one picked up). I looked online and racked my brain.. Does \"until\" include the day? \n\nIT HAS TO.\n\nWhy even mention it's until Friday if that doesn't include Friday? Why not just say it's until Thursday? That removes any ambiguity. If you say something is until Thursday, I can't show up on Friday and ask for it. You would just say it was until Thursday and today is Friday, sorry man. Clear as day. \nIf a teacher says your assignment can be handed in until Friday, you're damn sure everyone in the class knows it's until 11:59 PM Friday night. Cause guess what? The teacher can't say 11:59 PM on Thursday was the cut-off. That means it was due until Thursday.\n\nAnyway, so I make up my mind to call back. I'm not letting this dude make me feel stupid. I REFUSE to let someone get away with pulling wool over my eyes and then asking me why it's so dark now. \n\nI call back and it's the same guy and he tells me that he's found transcript of their phone message and that it clearly states \"until Friday February 9th\". I say okay so that proves my point right? He says no, until doesn't include the day. ARE YOU F**KING KIDDING ME. I shred this dude and tell how wrong he is. I tell him he has NO IDEA what he's talking about.\n\nHe again states that well, the whole point of the discount was because parts of the museum were closed but now that the museum is fully open BLA BLA....\n\nI hang up. I never argue with customer service representatives but this smug bastard can't get away with this. The fact that found the damn transcript and still said it doesn't include the day was the tipping point.\n\nMy friend came over a few minutes later and I told her the story. She agreed, until includes the day. I said, look, here the voice message  from the museum, tell me if there is any ambiguity. She says okay and we call back. \n\nGuess what?\n\nTHEY REMOVED THE VOICE MESSAGE. When you called now it just says their normal pricing. I couldn't believe it. This proves my point even further.\n\nAt this point i'm wondering if I even want to go because if I do i'm gonna cause a scene. As i'm thinking this I get a call from a sweet lady from the box-office. She saw I called and wanted to return it. I explain my story and she thinks for a moment. \n\n\"I'd say until does include the day, for sure.\"\n\nThank God. Everyone who works at the museum isn't stupid. She tells me that because of the ordeal I have a FREE TICKET waiting for me at admissions with my name on it.\n\nI thought of calling the guy back and rubbing it in his face but when I tell my friend he says \"Dude, there's no point. You don't need your 'Pretty Woman' moment\"\n\nAnyway, thats the end.\n\nTL;DR : Museum employee tells me the \"until Friday February 9th\" doesn't include Friday. We go back and forth, he doesn't back down, I end up speaking to another employee who gives me a free ticket.\n\nEDIT: I would like to clarify that although I come off as some angry dickhead in this post I was laughing and smirking the entire time. In my opinion, giving a day or date for a deadline is super ambiguous. It doesn’t specify if the deadline is at the beginning or end of the day. If you were to say something expires at 5 pm on Friday that is clear as day. I would also like to include that including a Friday for a deal ( as in Monday until Friday) almost always implies that Friday is included. It’s the end of the week. \n",

        "text": "The big grocery chain in my area just completely renovated one of the nearby locations, having acquired the newly vacated space next to their long-time spot. I went in recently on my lunch break to take advantage of the new shiny deli. Here’s why I’ll never go back. \n\nThe new store is busy. No surprise, as the whole neighborhood has blown up in recent years. I’m waiting in line at the deli, playing on my phone while I wait for the clerk to finish up an online order. He finishes and the woman in front of me is called to be helped. She immediately started going off on deli guy. \n\n“You NEVER make a customer wait! Now, I want olive loaf. Which slicer are you going to use?!” She demands to know. \n\nHe looks at her oddly because it’s not a common question. (Source: used to be a deli clerk) She repeats her question a few times, voice getting louder each time. Finally he gestures noncommittally at one of the slicers after looking at me to find out if he’s losing his mind or if she’s being crazy. Nah bro, she’s definitely being crazy. \n\nSo she holds her hands as close to his face as she can reach over the deli counter and says “ok, on THAT machine, I want it set to a FOUR, and I want olive loaf, and I want FOUR SLICES. Understand?!” She’s punctuating each louder word with a shove of her fat fingers. \n\nSo then while he’s trying to get her nasty olive loaf sliced, I get called up for my turn by this meek older woman. As I’m only planning to make a sandwich for myself, I asked for an 1/8th of a pound of the meat I want. She gets flustered, and rather than asking me if I know the decimal for that weight, she asks olive loaf lady. It’s then that I begin to realize, much to my horror, that olive loaf lady is an employee on her lunch break. \n\nOlive loaf lady has what should be white hair. Except it’s oily and stringy and yellowed and she reeks. She’s got no business working around food that’s going to be fed to any living creature. \n\nAnd this swamp hag (honestly, remember the crazy swamp hags from The Black Cauldron?) glares at me and yells “DONT YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDNT CONFUSE PEOPLE?!”\n\nI looked at the lady who was supposed to be helping me, realized she had zero intention of providing any customer service in this moment, and went off on the swamp hag. I told her she’s a rude slob who just lost not only my sale, but the business of everyone I could possibly inform of what had happened. I even ran into the president of the company that provides that grocer with their groceries to sell, and regaled her with the incident. And while they are a massive national chain, there are other massive national chains that have been giving them some stiff competition lately. They can’t afford to let hags chase off customers. Which is why I also gave name and description of the hag to the store manager. ",

I was 2nd in line, and the person in front of me was currently getting rung up. The cashier, an older lady, starts talking to me rather than the customer she was ringing up. C will be cashier, M will be me. \nC: Do you work at X company? (A different local grocery store)\nM: No\nC: Oh, okay cause you look like someone who works there. \nM: (just smiles uncomfortably)\nC: Do you have any sisters? \nM: Nope, just brothers. \nAt this point it was my turn to be rung up. \nC: You have to be careful around here. \n(I was confused cause this is a pretty safe area and it was daylight.) \nM: I know. \nC: You should carry some sort of protection. Bad men will try to take you. \nM: I have pepper spray. \nThe bag boy and I are giving each other strange looks. It’s almost like she doesn’t usually act like this towards customers. \nC: Good, good. Because we wouldn’t want anything to happen to you. We love you. \nM: (again I smile uncomfortably) Thanks. \nThen I pay, grab my bag and leave. \nI’ve never met this woman in my life, nor have I saw her there before. I thought about that for a long time after it happened, trying to come up with an explanation of why she would say these things to me. It scared me to be honest. I didn’t go back to that grocery store for awhile after that, but now I do and I still see that same cashier. I always try to avoid her but the other day I was pretty much forced to go in her line, as I was in another line and she came from her line to tell me she had no customers and to come over. I don’t know if she remembers me or that conversation but she didn’t say anything weird to me this time. ",

There were five total in our group, and we arrived at 5:50 pm. (One of my friend's mom is very particular about where she goes, so we have a text message timeline of this dining experience).\n\nA lot of us had homework, so we opted to go to the closer $restaurant rather than the downtown $restaurant, even though we know the service is slightly worse. Well, this time, it was abysmal. \n\nIt took 30 minutes to place an order, after them not giving us the proper menus. The first waiter totally ignored someone when they asked for hot chocolate, and then didn't even get water for a while. \n\nThe table next to us was vacant, as was most of the restaurant. (There were maybe 15 other people in the restaurant when we walked in, in groups sized 2-5 and three visible waitstaff milling about). Fifteen minutes after we say down, the vacant table was filled by a group of four. Remember, my group has five people in it. \n\nThey got far better service. The waiter constantly checked in on them and ignored us. They also got their food earlier than our table. \n\nMy table ended up waiting two full hours for our food. By then, the table of four had ordered, eaten, paid, and left. Our waiter refilled our waters once and checked in with us about three times while we waited for food. \n\nWe would have left, but kept assuming the food coming out of the kitchen would be ours, and we didn't want to drive around and wait more. And we asked about our food, when we were able to catch the waiter's attention, and he kept saying \"soon\". Soon apparently equals 2 hours. \n\nAnd the all you can eat pancakes were very slow to be refilled. We could have eaten more, but after 3 hours of sitting in $restaurant we were done.  According to my friend's texts, we left almost exactly three hours after we arrived. Not worth. ",

He dropped into a truck stop tonight to grab a snack and ended up having an interaction with what he referred to as a \"certified f***wit\" \n\nAfter getting his snack and a drink, he queued up to check out. He was waiting patiently in line when another truck driver entered the store and walked straight up to the woman in line directly in front him.

Not even the rim of the cup, but the little indentation rim that such cups are normally filled to. I apologized, then asked if she wouldn't mind filling the rest of the cup with milk. She said, \"Sure, but I'll have to charge you for the extra milk.\" \n\nI was so taken aback I didn't even argue about never having been charged before, or the fact that I was actually getting less milk than a normal, hot version (SAME PRICE AND SAME SIZE CUP!) anyway because of the presence of ANY ice...

I ask an employee for the price and he said that he didn’t know. I figured one of the clerks might be able to scan it for the price. I grab the 50 and go over to the counter. He scans it for about $20. \n\nMe: That’s expensive for salt. Do you have any cheaper options?\n\nClerk: There are smaller bags for $10 in a different section of the store.\n\nMe: Alright thanks.\n\nI walk around aisles and I see another employee.

I take the bag back to the checkout. I pay for my more than half price salt, and leave the store. \n\nSo a store tried to get me to pay more than twice the price of a bag of salt.

Maybe being prior military I'm desensitized.\n\nPS: Heard a story from a friend whose gun accidentally slipped out of his holster onto the seat at a restaurant while he was dining with his family and left to the car. He came back in to retrieve it and the restaurant guys put up a big fuss and threatened to call the cops. Friend, being an avid gun owner, NRA member, and law abiding citizen, encouraged them to wholeheartedly. They gave his gun back after he called their bluff and explained that having a gun is not illegal as long as you're not drinking alcohol, at a place that primarily serves alcohol, or the owner has posted no weapons allowed.\n\nJust to be clear, I try never to let my weapon be visible to anyone, specifically because I don't want to trigger PTSD in anyone or otherwise bother people.",

        "text": "This is almost 20 years ago that this happened. I acquired a small loan to buy a car. It was for just over $1000 IIRC. My payment was something like $50/month. This was back in the day when you had to go to your managing branch to deposit cheques, really to do most banking.\n\nI moved from the suburbs to the city centre, so I decided to change my managing branch. I made an appointment with the branch and they changed everything over. I confirmed with the bank which account my loan payment was to come out of and confirmed the dates, etc.\n\nNext payment date, the money is there but it doesn’t come out. I notice this on my statement. A few days later I get a letter from a collections agency. I take the letter and my statement to the branch to complain. They see me and fix everything. I confirm again the account and dates, etc. \n\nNext month the same thing happens except this time the letter from collections is demanding immediate payment in full. Again, I take my documents to the branch and insist on speaking with a manager. When I finally see said manager she says “oh you! You are so high maintenance!” \n\nEx-fucking-scuse me? High maintenance? You assholes just sent me to a collection agency twice for your own fuck ups!\n\nThe manager got everything ACTUALLY sorted and the next month my payment had no issues. They refused to have the collections action removed from my credit report. \n\nAs soon as that loan was paid off I closed my account and refuse to use any services or ATMs offered by that bank. ",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, on mobile. Bit of a shaggy dog story. TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nHi!\n\nThere is a transport company here which has an absolute monopoly on buses, trams, subways and trains. We'll call them Trouble. I've been with Trouble for three years, but changed my payment plan last August to a cheaper one because I didn't need their services quite so much. They didn't like that much.\n\nAs such, they've variously disconnected, deactivated or otherwise stopped my subscription four times since August. This is an annual subscription which renews automatically, and without it, I can't take any public transport at all, so no going to work or coming back home. Please bear in mind that every time my card is deactivated, I have to make several long phone calls with lots of lovely hold music, go into their agency (taking public transport to do so, so risking a fine), queue for a couple of hours, explain my story twenty times and get a new card for a fee. \n\n**The first time**, they deactivated it with no reason and actually admitted it was for no reason. I paid for the month separately, they reactivated it thereon after about a week of emails and phone calls.  \n**The second time**, they said I'd been putting my transport card too close to my phone, which had deactivated it. They are kept in opposite coat pockets, but okay, if you say so. I'll be more careful. I paid for the month again.  \n**The third time**, it was the first of the month and they'd decided I didn't need to go to work. Unfortunately, my boss didn't agree with that. I paid yet again for the month, complaining to myself about the use of having an annual card if this keeps happening.\n\nCue **the fourth time**. Yesterday.\n\nYesterday morning, my card doesn't work at the tram stop. I need to go to work, so I take the tram anyway, and call Trouble when I get there.\n\n**Me:** Hi, my card didn't work this morning. Could you help me understand why?\n\n**Trouble:** OK, lets have a look. I see. You haven't paid since August, so your service has been cut off.\n\n**Me:** That can't be right. I signed the paperwork allowing you to take the money from my bank account, and I'm certain I have sufficient funds there. I know I'm on a teacher's salary, but I can still afford to go to work.\n\n**Trouble:** Ahhh, now, yes, you're right, but it looks like we didn't send the paperwork to your bank. So as we haven't been paid, we've cut off your service.\n\n**Me:** Umm... Couldn't you have told me there was a problem before cutting off my service? And why did you wait for five months?\n\n**Trouble:** That's the system, ma'am. So you need to come to our agency and pay the full yearly amount, and we'll give you a new card for free as a commercial gesture.\n\n**Me:** Okay, I guess I don't have much of a choice. I'll be in after work.\n\n[Fast forward to later that afternoon]\n\n**Me:** Hi, I'm here to pay for my subscription and get a new card.\n\n**Trouble:** You need to go to accounts. It's the next building on your left, third floor, not the big lift in front of you but the small one on the right, then go down the corridor and ask at window 17.\n\n[At window 17]\n\n**Me:** Hi... (repeats story)\n\n**Trouble:** Oh, you don't need me. You need to go to the first desk, they'll help you. Yes, that's right, the one you've just come from.\n\n[At the first desk]\n\n**Trouble:** Hello again ma'am. I see you went to the wrong desk. You know, it's nearly closing time, you really need to be more careful. Anyway, I'll print your new card for you. Please give me your payment.\n\n[Holds out bank card]\n\n**Trouble:** Ah, no, I can't take that here. You need to go to window 17. Do you need me to explain how to get there?\n\n[Grrr. Rinse and repeat] \n\n**Me:** How can I stop this happening again? \n\n**Trouble:** You should be more careful with your card so as not to deactivate it. \n\n**Me:** I've been nothing but careful. This is where I put it, this is what I do... \n\n**Trouble:** In that case, you're being too careful. Just do it properly, like everyone else does. Some people... \n\nGrrr... \n\n**TL;DR:** Transport company deactivates my card four times and tells me it's my fault. ",

Even after several years I still cringe because this was legitimately one of the worst moments I’ve had. \n\nTo start, I’m from a very conservative part of the country. People here also tend to both be very chatty in public places and also speak their minds (politely in tone but not always in words). \n\nI was in line at a large pharmacy chain waiting to get some medication my doctor prescribed prior to getting an IUD inserted. I was young and wanting to be safe and scared out of my mind over the whole affair. Once I got to the counter the tech loudly asked me if I was having an abortion. I was absolutely floored. The only thing I could muster was “Where would I be getting one?” because the closest Planned Parenthood was over 2 hrs away. The pharmacy tech just roller her eyes and handed over the meds. \n\nTo this day I wish I would’ve come up with a clever comeback but I was just too floored that she asked loud enough that the entire line would hear. I also wished that I would’ve reported her but I was already freaked out enough by getting the IUD. \n\nTL;DR pharmacy tech makes assumptions about IUD meds and asks young and scared woman about getting an abortion in front of a whole line of people in an ultra-conservative part of the country",

We get forwarded surveys our patients fill out after finishing regular treatments with us. Those surveys are put together and given to higher ups and used for things like deciding funding, etc. Anywho....\n\nWhen I was 20 I had an unplanned pregnancy, my family is very conservative so I decided to keep my baby (thank GOD, she is a happy wonderful 7 year old). Being 20, I didn’t want anyone in the room with me outside of her Dad when I was giving birth. I made this clear to my doctor and he was fine with it. So I get to the hospital 1 week past my due date to be induced. I’m there about 18 hours and nada. Baby is camping. The nurses asked if I minded having a student watch my birth to which I said no because I was a kid and from a small town and didn’t want some student I probably knew looking at my lady bits. \n\nFast forward to a few hours later when it’s time to push, they bring the student nurse in to watch, I’m mid-push and see her walk in. Literally open the door and walk in to me saying GET OUT. The nurses try to convince me to “let her stay so she can learn” and I about lose my mind. She leaves, finally. Baby comes, is happy and healthy. I needed stitches and the doctor gives me some sort of pain killers orally for that. I’m not sure if tiredness or the drugs were to blame but my hands were shaking uncontrollably to the point that I couldn’t hold my baby without fear of dropping her. The same labor/delivery nurse that brought a student in against my wishes decided once my family went home and I was alone in my recovery room that that was her moment to come in and ask me why I wasn’t nursing my child (I let another nurse take her to the nursery for a bottle). While lecturing me on “not doing the best for my baby” she lifted my gown to check my stomach and said “OH WOW....that’s a lot of stretch marks. Don’t bother buying the creams those will never go away.”\n\nYeah I think I cried most of that night. That nurse was an asshole and I wish I had known how much our surveys matter (I now work for a branch of the same hospital) because when I got that in the mail I just laughed and threw it away. I should’ve ripped her a new one. Le sigh. \n\n",

        "text": "I have two stories from the same local plumbing supply store to share. Both of them happened within a few months of each other, both are similar in nature (I was told I was wrong when I wasn't) and both involve the same salesperson.\n\nA few years ago the underground pipe connecting my house to the water main started leaking, badly. The front of my house was a swamp. I had to shut the water off and dig a gigantic hole to find the source of the leak. I was exhausted and filthy (I couldn't shower as we had no water). I measured the diameter of the pipe so I would know what size to buy and set off for the local plumbing store.\nI told the guy at the counter my problem and that I only needed a small length of pipe and a pair of connectors. I told him the diameter of the pipe and he just scoffed at me and said, \n\"There's no such thing as a pipe in that size.\"\n\"Oh, well my measurement might be a bit off. What do you have that's close to that?\"\nHe then showed me what is normally used for underground mains and I could tell that it was way bigger than the pipe I have.\nI told him this and he flatly told me I must be wrong as this is what they use.\nI then said, \"Well my house is pretty old, it was built in the 70's I think. Would they have used this size pipe back then.\"\n\"I don't know what else they would use.\" he answered.\nI repeated over and over that the pipe he was trying to sell me was too big but he just kept telling me that no such size pipe exists. I could tell I was getting no-where, So I decided to go back home, take a photo of the pipe with a measuring tape over it and then return.\nI showed him the photo and he just told me that it must be wrong... I was confused at this point (how could my photo be wrong?) and asked if there was someone else around who might know. No-one else would be in until later that afternoon. \nAt this point I decided to go home again and cut out the section of pipe with the split - something I didn't want to do just yet because as soon as I do that it means that we will have no water until I'm able to fix it completely.\nOnce I return with the small piece of pipe, he takes one look at it and scoffs at me again.\n\"Gee you must have an old house. They haven't used this stuff for years.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\"Well they used to use this size pipe for mains years ago but then they changed it to the bigger pipe.\"\n\"Well I told you my house was old.\"\n\"I didn't know you meant THAT old.\"\nSo now I'm just pissed off. This guys was so adamant that no such sized pipe even exists and made me drive back and forth just to prove him wrong.\nHe goes out the back, cuts a piece of the pipe (no such size pipe exists but they have a gigantic roll of it right there...) I get the connectors off the shelf and head home to put it together. \n\nFast forward a few months and I'm putting a deck out the back of my house. Towards the end of the project I have to extend the down-pipe from my roof gutters. These down pipes are metal and rectangular in shape, which I didn't think anything of, but more on that soon. I measure up the down pipe and go in to the same store to find the same guy behind the counter. I'm sure he doesn't remember me but I certainly remember him.\nI explain to him what I need, tell him the measurements and I get the exact same response; a scoff, then \"there's no such thing as a rectangular pipe.\"\n\"Mate, there certainly is. All the down pipes on my house are metal and rectangular.\" \n\"No, they can't be. We only use round pipes.\"\nNow it's my turn to laugh.\n\"What do you mean they can't be? They are! I know the difference between a circle and a rectangle. My house is very old, as is my neighbours house and the house across the road from me. They all have rectangular down pipes.\"\n\"Oh, well it's probably the old box pipe.\" he says.\n\"So it does exist?\"\n\"Well yeah, but we don't sell it.\"\n\"That's fine, I'll take the round stuff. But I just need an adapter so I can join the box pipe to the round pipe.\"\nThis fucker scoffs again. \"No, there's no such thing.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"No, you'll have to remove the whole down pipe and replace it. You can't just join the round pipe onto the bottom.\"\n\"But there's a rectangular hole in the gutters. How do I join the round pipe into the rectangular hole?\"\n\"Well, you can't I guess.\"\n\"So I have to replace the entire gutter?\"\n\"I guess so. That's the problem with these old houses.\"\n\"So there's no converter or adapter or anything that goes from rectangle to round?\"\n\"No.\" he says getting visibly frustrated.\nI concede defeat at this point and we start talking prices for gutters and pipes. He walks me down an aisle of the store to show me something else and I see a big box full of 'box pipe to round adapters' literally right there about 5 meters from his counter.\n\"Hang on, what's this?\" I ask picking one up.\n\"Oh. Oh yeah, this is probably what you're after.\"\n\"So they do exist?\"\n... no response.\n\"I'll just take one of these thanks.\" I say. Best part was is that they were only 90 cents.\n\nI have never been back to that store.",

        "text": "This happened around the beginning of my first year of high school. I don't know how it is for other countries (or states apparently), but we're required, from K-12 to do summer reading assignments and writing a book report on it. Failure to do so results in a zero for an assignment that takes up ~20-25% of your Language Arts grade for the first term.\n\nMe and my brother, the procrastinators we were, left off the assignment until the last few weeks of summer. Naturally, our dad was immensely pissed that we waited all this time to complete our assignments. So, we hop in the car and go off to the bookstore. We manage to find my book, but not my brothers because they didn't have it/they were out of stock/whatever. We were forced to go to another bookstore in another town.\n\nNow, I'd like to point out two things before I continue:\n\n1. It was raining heavily that day. Like hard rain.\n\n2. This was ~2007 or so when smartphones weren't really a thing and I didn't have anything really to occupy me (portable DVD player, laptop, etc.). \n\nSo my dad told me I'd better start reading or else he'll be even more pissed. I thought \"screw it, I've got nothing else better to do. May as well read\". I get to reading the book on the way to the second bookstore and find it a surprisingly good read.\n\nWe get to the second bookstore and my dad doesn't want me staying out in the car by myself. I, however, don't want to stop reading my book because not only did I like the book, but I always lived by the mindset that \"if I don't do it now, I won't do it later\". So I decide to bring the book into the bookstore. Also note that my dad doesn't know I brought it in.\n\nMy brother and my dad are looking for the book while I'm sitting in one of the reading areas going through my book. My dad and brother eventually find his book and check it out. They call me over and it's time to leave. Now, it's still raining like all hell outside and I don't want the book getting wet at all. So me at the time, genius that I was, decided to conceal it underneath my jacket. And you can guess what happens when we try to leave...\n\nThe store alarm goes off.\n\nThe manager comes up and the exchange goes a little something like this.\n\n&gt;Manager: Excuse me sir, are you attempting to steal that item?\n\n&gt;Dad: No, we bought the book at (insert store name here) in (insert town name here).\n\n&gt;M: Yeah, well unless you have proof that you did, I'm going to have to call (insert local police dept here).\n\n&gt;D: Fine. (Insert my brother's name here), go out to the car and get the receipt.\n\nSo my brother goes outside into the pouring rain to get the receipt. My dad presents it to him and the manager nearly shits his pants at the fact that we were telling him the truth. But instead of an apology like my dad was expecting, the manager simply says:\n\n&gt;M: Okay, thanks. Have a nice day.\n\nMy dad was steaming obviously\n\n&gt;D: (barging out of the store while muttering under his breath) ^jerkoff\n\n&gt;M: Excuse me, sir, did you say something.\n\n&gt;D: (loudly) **I SAID YOU'RE A JERKOFF. FUCK OFF YOU ASSHOLE.**\n\nThis story always makes me laugh because of the monumental fuckup that I did just because I didn't use common sense. It's also funnier at the fact that my dad never set foot in that store because \"I might see that fucking jerkoff again\"\n\nThe only thing I couldn't figure out was why the alarm didn't go off when I went *in* the store.\n\nIf I remember correctly, I also received a weeks grounding for my stupidity",

Arrived at around 1pm, we were told to come back later, despite it looking as though they had loads of free tables. They're open all day from 12, so we're OK with that.\n\nNo probs, lots to see and do, so we go back at around 2:30. Again, told they are really busy and it will be a half hour wait. By now there are only 5 or 6 tables taken (of around 30 total) in the main dining room that I can see, and they all seem to be finishing up.\n\nWe decide to wait, and around ten minutes later the young hostess comes back and sees us still there. \"Errgh. Well. I *suppose* I could seat you in the other dining room. That OK?\" We reply that it's fine, and hope that the waiter will be a bit nicer to us than she is!\n\nShe takes us around a corner to a table with a fabulous view of the river. It looks lovely, so we're happy again. But she's forgotten our menus, and will be right back with them.\n\nTen minutes later, I walk back to the podium and pick up two menus myself. We choose quickly (we're hungry now, it's nearly 3pm) and wait. And wait. Five past 3 now, I walk out and find a waitress in uniform who's eating. I say I'm sorry to interrupt, but is there anyone who could take our order? She's nice, and goes back to the kitchen to find someone for us. Another waitress comes out.\n\n\"I can't believe they sat you here. This is a VIP table. Oh, well. What do you want?\"\n\nWe order. 15 minutes later, I go and pick my own drinks up off the bar. The barman is in the kitchen, chatting. No sign of the waitress.\n\n30 minutes after we ordered, my wife goes looking for someone this time. Perhaps they'll be nicer to her? The nice waitress sees us, and rushes out with our meals, apologising.\n\nBy this point I just want to eat and leave, so I don't order any more drinks. We finish up, and I go to find someone to give us the bill, voucher in hand.\n\nThere is not a single other person in the entire restaurant. No-one in the kitchen, no-one in a room marked \"Private\" which I presume is the manager's office. I even phone the restaurant, it rings at the podium, then bounces to the office, nothing.\n\nWe wait another 15 minutes, maybe they're all on a smoke break? Our whole afternoon is gone now, shops are starting to shut. Eventually we just walk out. \n\nTwenty minutes later, we're walking across a bridge to the car park, and can see the back of the restaurant. There's a picnic bench set up, they're all sitting around it with empty plates and beer bottles. I'm guessing the manager wasn't in that day...",

        "text": "Here is my horror story about a very incompetent neurologist I was referred to.\n\nThis goes back over 4 years ago late 2013. For starters my husband and I had moved to a new state, and so all new doctors and all that. Got a great primary care doc, we still see her, but she referred me to this neurologist....\n\nFirst off, I had my first seizure back in 2011, I passed out at my husbands work and woke up 24 hours later in a larger hospital 1 hour from home. That was in good ol West Virginia...they literally sedated me for 24 hours because the small hospital in our local town didn’t understand why I was seizing. Definitely not drugs I have never ever done drugs. They run a whole bunch of tests and keep me in the hospital 4 days for nothing. I was on the infectious disease ward as an immunocompromised person. They were stupid too..very stupid I hardly saw a doctor and because we were uninsured I could leave against medical advice, which I did. My mom in law stayed with me for 2 weeks. I was then seizure free almost 2 years.\n\nThis is where my story starts, I actually passed out at church and started having a seizure. I get taken to the ER, and they don’t sedate me like they did in WV, after an hour of seizing-they give me something to stop it I pass out and come to 3 hours later. They release me, I follow up with my doctor who refers me to the neurologist. He was of Indian descent, most of his patients I noticed were drugged out of their mind-on Medicaid, I was on my husbands company insurance, which is still great insurance. He does the ekg, and shows that my brain is showing seizures...so he gives me copious amounts of meds, I mean so many I can barely function. I’m 27, totally naive, and figure that’s what needs done. Seizures continue. I have to quit my high stress job (this comes into play later) and then he orders me in for a 48 hour sleep study. All goes well the first day, my family visits, my husband comes after work. Next day, take my meds as usual, then they come in and are going to do tests. They give me yet MORE meds, doctors orders, and start the light/strobe tests. Almost immediately my body starts seizing up and I lose consciousness. This is secondhand, our friend from church came AT THAT MOMENT to see me. He said my neurologist was screaming at the nurses, pacing back and forth and starts yelling about some medication to insert into my arm. At that point I know I’m dying, I felt very calm and peaceful and then boom I’m back to reality. Doctor comes in says “you need to go home”. They unhook me from everything, I call my brother, I wasn’t allowed to drive for a month he picks me up and takes me home. From our friend he said that the nurses were telling the doctor you need to take her to the er, call 911. He didn’t do it because he didn’t want to get in trouble. I was too stupid to even think about pressing charges against him.\n\nI find out a month later I’m 6 weeks pregnant, and 3 months later that my seizures are caused by stress/bipolar disorder mood shifts. Pregnancy also causes my seizures so we cannot have anymore kids. I cannot work, I have to keep a low stress lifestyle. As long as I take my medicine as prescribed I literally have not had a seizure in close to 2 years. However a good friend of mine, her husband was just diagnosed last year with Parkinson’s and he went to him 1 time. He and I both couldn’t remember his name, but he said he was creeped out by him. I don’t see a neurologist now because I’m very scared of doctors.\n\nI see my primary care doctor when I have to, my ob/gyn for my birth control and my med manger for my bipolar disorder/anxiety. \n\nI have no idea if he is still practicing we still live in the area but I refuse to see him again. He almost killed me and my daughter! I was around 3 weeks when I almost died. My husband regrets not being there but he had just started his job 6 months before and couldn’t take time off. I just want everyone to know be aware of who’s treating you and use more common sense than I did. I’m a whole lot wiser now and more proactive than I was then. \n\nAdd to the story-Whatever happened the day of the seizure has messed up my brain permanently. I have very poor short term memory since that day. Long term I can remember things before the seizure, but after things are kinda blurry. I’m fine with dates, but I keep a reminder of all passwords/emails because I will forget if it’s not wrote down. I take tons of pictures it reminds me of things. My husband gives me reminders if I need help. It’s frustrating but such is life.",

All I wanted was a couple cheeseburgers.\n\nMe: I'll take two cheeseburgers, please.\nEmployee: Two CHEESEBURGERS?!\nMe: Yes? What's up?\nEmployee: we're serving breakfast.\nMe: oh that's weird, because right behind you the menu is changed. Are you sure? \n(I could also see the crew getting french fries and patties ready) \nEmployee: Yes. We serving breakfast.\n\nI was feeling particularly unargumentative and I didn't want to be the fatty to throw a fit over a cheeseburger, so I just ordered some breakfast burritos. The guys right behind me in line ordered lunch and got it, which irked me, but whatever. \n\nI waited for a long time for those breakfast burritos (long after the guys got their lunch) and when I finally did they weren't very good. \nSo after I ate I pulled the manager to the side and asked right in front of the cashier that helped me: \"What time is lunch served?\" \nShe answered \"10:30\" and I said \"Well, I ordered lunch at 10:30 and didn't get it, but maybe next time.\" \n\"Wait. She didn't let you get lunch?\" \n\"No ma'am, maybe next time.\" \n\nI swear, the evil eye I got from that girl was horrible and hilarious. ",

        "text": "I’ve been seeing other hospital horror stories here, so I decided to add mine. \n\nThis is my first child at 25. I was admitted with preeclampsia and they determined it was best to induce me that evening. \n\nThey get me to my room and start the pitocin and put me on magnesium so I don’t have a seizure with my high blood pressure. \n\nAfter that it was a waiting game, so me and my husband just chill. That was a Thursday night and I don’t progress any the first 18 or so hours. So Friday they insert a balloon in my cervix without telling me it would hurt or offering me anything for pain. And let me tell you, going from a 1 to a 5 instantly FUCKING HURTS. \n\nI was in so much pain I asked for the epidural and they tried to talk me out of it... Yet the nurse who inflated the balloon stated “oh yeah! We have to give people heavy pain meds for this all the time! Sometimes before we do it!” And here all they offer to give me is Tylenol afterward, when I felt like I was being ripped apart from the inside. All because they didn’t want to have to cath me yet. That was red flag number one.\n\nI have to wait what feels like eternity, but is really about an hour for them to come shove this giant needle in my back so I can get some relief and try to rest. It takes them a while to get it in the right spot, but it works and I’m so relieved. \n\nSo I start to progress and the time comes to start pushing. Despite the epidural, I still felt quite a lot of pain in the 3.5 hours I had to push. And finally my little girl made her appearance. \n\nI’m exhausted and a little loopy from the magnesium, but I’ll never forget how bad her little head was molded from the way she was sitting for so long. In fact they wouldn’t let me hold her or do skin-to-skin. A group of nurses whisked her away to her bassinet and started wiping and suctioning her. I only heard her make one little squeak. \n\nThen a NICU nurse pops in, takes a few seconds to look at my daughter, then loudly proclaims “that mother needs to hold this baby. She might not make it through the night.” My husband, my mother and I all heard her. The doctor didn’t say a damn thing, nor did any of the other nurses. I held her, sobbing, long enough for my husband to take a picture before they took her to NICU. \n\nAs my husband leaves to call his family and tell them what’s happening, I’m being stitched up while a bunch of cheery nurses are laughing and joking around me as they clean. Pretending I’m basically not there. Then the bitches thought they lost a piece of gauze in me. They didn’t, thank god, so they moved me to a shitty little shoebox room where I crashed from pure exhaustion, even though I was dying to know how my baby was. \n\nWhen I woke up at 6 am I immediately called the NICU and the only competent nurse I spoke to my entire stay told me that the original nurse was wrong, my daughter was fine. Just bruised and swollen from the birth, but otherwise she was perfectly healthy. \n\n12 hours later (after they made sure her blood sugar was okay) she was finally given to me. A couple of other mildly irritating things occurred during my stay, like the lactation nurses made me feel like shit and they never gave me my antidepressant while I was there, but I was so thrilled to have my baby with me and know she was okay. \n\nBut the trauma of that night stayed with me a long, long time. I’m so angry at that hospital and I wouldn’t wish them on my worst enemy. Come to find out they’re infamous for their shitty women’s care. I considered filing a claim against that nurse, but of course she never gave us her name and it’s conveniently not on any of the paperwork. They need to teach her proper bedside manner at the least.\n\nToday my daughter is a healthy 8 month old with only a small scar under her nose to show for her struggles. She’s sitting up by herself, she can say “da da,” and she just cut her first tooth. \n\nEdit: forgive grammar or spelling mistakes. I’m quickly typing this on my phone on my lunch break. ",

        "text": "I saw a couple posts about the ER and I was reminded of this one recently. Mine isn't as dire as some of those, I wasn't going to die but I really didn't like the emergency room people after this.\n\nI get kidney stones frequently. I've been to the ER several times for them. Often I don't have to go but there are a few factors that will lead me to go: If the pain is over a 7, I'm throwing up so often I can't even drink water, I have a fever or if I haven't been able to urinate. \n\nIn this situation, the pain was really bad and I was throwing up frequently to the point where I was light headed and dizzy from being dehydrated so I went to the ER for it. The normal treatment I get is anti-nausea medication, morphine and an IV to get fluids while they check to make sure it's not too big. \n\nBy the time they got me back(which took a while), the pain had gone down quite a bit to the point where I didn't really need the morphine (and I don't like taking anything that strong for pain unless I needed it). I still felt sick and was still dehydrated. They got me the nausea medication and told me if the pain started again to let the nurse know and they'll get me the morphine then. Then they put in in a chair to wait.\n\nThey didn't give me any water or an IV so I still felt really light headed. I had trouble giving a urine sample because there was pretty much nothing there. The pain came back after a while so I let them know and waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nI wasn't trying to bother them but I reminded them a couple times and nothing. It wasn't until they took me back to be discharged that they finally gave it to me (they claimed I had completely refused it the first time, which wasn't true.)\n\nSo I was stuck sitting there in pain, dehydrated and light-headed for hours. To top it off, I asked for paperwork to give my job since I had to miss work and they gave me discharge papers that had absolutely no information on what it actually was, they were basically blank with just the basic information filled out.\n\nIt was a little busy, but at the same time it wasn't completely hectic. Taking more than 3 hours to get someone in obvious pain some kind of medication and neglecting to do something for them being really dehydrated seems like a bit of a fuck up.\n\nThat was a fun day.",

Now normally being a cheap College guy and going to cost cutters or some other $10 fix her up. I decided to kill two birds with one stone and go to the mall as well as just use the salon there to get my haircut. \n\nAs I walked in to the salon I was greeted with one lady smiling and quick turning to finish her work on a customer and another man chatting it up with a customer. \n\nAfter standing around for about 30 seconds they asked me what they could do for me. \n\nI told him I was here for a haircut. \n\nThen this man said “well you’ve gotta sign your name on the papers first.”\n\nWhich, judging by the tone of his voice and cocked eyebrow stare. It felt more like a\n“what the fuck does this retard think he’s doing in here, idiot, don’t ya know how this fiasco works”\n\nSo I just say oh okay. Not aware that was how we had to sign in. So I signed my name and took a seat to wait.\n\nThe entire time we were waiting me and my friend both felt a bit uncomfortable and he even asked if I wanted to go to a different place. \n\nBecause I’m pretty sure it was the only place to get my hair done I just waited out. But I was still baffled on this man’s negligence for customer care and hospitality. \n\nI have worked customer service jobs For many years and I can’t just fathom the entitlement some employees think they have because of this that or the other. \n\nThat’s not how you run a business idiot.\n\nMaking customers feel unwanted and pressured is a swift way to lose business and get a bad rep. So I don’t know what crap is going on in your day but for you to make a smirk comment as if I’m supposed to know how the whole operation works at a place I just visited for the first time... then you can take the fuck yourself train and your “occasional 3 second envy stares while I wait” to fucksville. \n\nThe lady that cut my hair was extremely sweet though.

I'm pretty shy, socially anxious to some extent definitely (diagnosed with GAD just a couple years ago now), and I am hesitant to speak up most times, unless it's a big deal. Anyway, we want some ranch with our fries; since I'm closest to the counter, I decide to get up from my seat and ask for some. \n\nI get up there and the dude, probably in early or mid-20's, asks if he can help me. \n\n\"Yes, I'd like a couple of ranch's, please\"\n\nHe seems to hesitate for a few seconds before shrugging his shoulders and grabbing a small drink cup and setting it on the counter. Instantly, I'm confused. He starts grabbing handfuls of those ranch packets and putting/ stacking them INSIDE the cup. \n\nNow I know I'm just raising an eyebrow in confusion, my mind racing, my heart beating fast. What is going on? My mouth is dry, I can't say a word. Did he... Did he hear me say \"cup full\"? Is that why there's a cup involved in this? Was my voice too quiet? Did I mumble? Should I stop him, speak up? No, by this point it's too late - he's already fit as many ranch cups into this drinking cup as he can (at least 6 of them), even though I only wanted two. \n\n\"Here you go.\" He hands me the cup, and I thank him- I can't look him in the eye and I rush back to the table; I'm so embarrassed. I wonder if he realized I only said \"couple\" later that day, or if he just thought I was a strange tween with an even stranger request. Like, how often do people ask for enough sauces to fill a drinking cup?\n\nI've never had something like that happen to me since (been about 12 years), and I can't recall seeing him again. It's not some huge or ridiculous thing, but still.. it makes me cringe when I think back on it!",

Check anyway, barely touch the handle and it flushes no problem. I look around the room and she's not only not flushed, she pissed on the seat AND left the sink running. wtf.\n\nWorst part?

I just wanted to share an experience and see if anyone had had similar ones regarding drivers like this.\n\nMaybe it's karma that I decided to order some crappy fast food on a delivery app at about 9pm and got a crappy experience. Everything proceeded as normal and the driver arrived half an hour later. I opened the door, he greeted me and handed me my food. This is where it gets weird.\n\nThis guy then proceeds to talk AT me for at least another half an hour. I literally cannot get a word in edgewise. He starts of course on the topic of an imminent war in Iran, and moves on to his beliefs about fallen angels walking the earth, that the government know about but keep secret. Did I know his friend's father worked at a large observatory in (nearby observatory) and investigated alien signals? Did you know he sent emails to NASA about something he thought he saw on the moon one night? etc etc\n\nHere's the corker. The guy then asks me if I'd like to get coffee sometime, and discuss all this, bear in mind that he is easily twice my age. He says I'm in good shape and gives me the once up and down look. Then he asks me again, to dinner. I flash a (fake) wedding ring and excuse myself from any dates, all the while feeling pretty terrified. He says obviously he's disappointed, but to \"bring your husband along anyway!\". \n\nI'm a person of diminutive stature so it doesn't take much to put me on edge, and I understand this guy was probably under the impression that all this was perfectly polite and normal, but when a stranger is literally at your door and practically insisting that you come to dinner with him it will make for an unnerving experience.\n\nTo top it all off, he asks, \"What's the custom for saying goodbye where you're from?\". I don't remember what I answered but I'm pretty sure he was angling for a kiss on the cheek. He's satisfied with a grasp of my hand, and EVENTUALLY leaves after giving me his email, which he makes sure I have in my phone. He says if he's in the area he'll drop round and see if i'm around (yikes).\n\nI haven't answered the door for a week, and when I leave in the morning I take the private back alley. Hopefully he gets the hint I'm not interested when I never send him an email.\n\nI sent a complaint to the delivery app, and they responded properly about a week later, asking if they could discuss all this in a phone call. That hasn't happened yet, but I'll update the post when/if it does.\n\nTL;DR : order crappy delivery and get held at the door for half an hour by a delivery guy insisting on a date. \n\nI'll leave a link to my complaint to the app in the comments.\n\nedit-spelling\n",

It was pretty busy, as expected for Sunday brunch, but we did have time constrains, so we weren't sure if we'd stay or not. I approached the host and asked him how long the wait would be for a party of two. He responded by asking for my name, which I politely gave to him, but then proceeded to inform him that we might not be staying, we just wanted a wait time. His response was completely out of the blue, and filled with attitude: \"Well I can't just give you that, I have to ask you multiple questions. It's NOT the same as taking a temperature.\" He basically yelled that at me. I was a hostess for 4 years, and I don't recall needing more than a party size to give a wait time, but maybe this restaurant had some weird seating style. What really got me was how he yelled at me completely unprovoked. We decided to leave a review of our experience on Google, and the owner responded immediately calling us liars and telling us we were spreading false information about their restaurant.

        "text": "I'm currently sitting in my hotel room seriously pissed.  My son has been very sick and we traveled seven hours to see a specialist.  Since his appointment is at 8am we decided to get a hotel room for the night.  I made a reservation with a chain I have stayed with in the past and have had great experiences with.  We arrived early last night and I tried parking to check in.  Due to heavy snowfall and lack of plowing there were no open parking spots near the office so I had to park on the other side of the building and walk around to reach the office. Once at my room the door wouldn't open. It is snowing and 3 degrees out so it was very frustrating.  Finally I decided to go to the front desk. \n\n\nI had to walk around the building which the sidewalks have not been shoveled.   Due to about three inches of snow it was difficult to see where the sidewalks should be.  I made it with only tripping once and informed the clerk that the door would not open.  She grabbed a heat gun and managed to get the door open.  I didn't realize this was the universe trying to help me out.  \n\nWe proceeded to hang out, order takeout and just chill.   Then I wanted to get ready for the morning and I noticed that we had no towels in our room.  I called the desk who informed me that she was doing laundry and would have some in about two hours and I needed to come get them.  Awesome.  So I stayed up two hours later than I wanted just so we could have showers in the morning. \n\nFinally we went to bed since we have such an early morning today.   Then at midnight suddenly we woke up to the fire alarm going off.   We jumped out of bed bundled up my son as best we could and ran outside into the freezing snow.  After five minutes of freezing and not seeing any fire trucks or smoke we started calling the front desk to find out what was happening.  No answer.  I tried for at least another five minutes before I finally gave up and we all shuffled back into the room and went back to sleep.   Not even an hour later once again the alarm goes off.  Once again we sprung out of bed and ran outside.  Once again no answer at the front desk.   Back inside to bed.  This happened four times until we just started ignoring the alarm.   \n\nThen this morning I woke early to get ready for the appointment I got out all our shower things and got ready for my shower only to discover there is no water.   Awesome.   I called the front desk in vain once again.  I then bundled up and tromped out through the snow to the office where the front desk person was engrossed in a Netflix movie.   I asked about the water and he informed me a pipe broke last night.  Didn't I hear the fire alarms going off?   \n\nGritting my teeth I said yes and I had tried to call the front desk to see what was going on and they hadn't answered.  He replied, \"oh yeah I stopped answering the phones because people were just calling and yelling at me and there wasn't anything I could do to fix it.\"   I was in awe of the stupidity.   So I said, \"you mean to tell me that you just decided to not answer the phone during a potential crisis situation because it was too much of a bother?\"   I was aghast.  \n\nSo now I'm up no showers today I guess and I'll let everyone else sleep in because it's not like we can do anything.

If you’ve never lived in the Middle East (in particular the big city of plastic and glass in the Emirates) you’d have no idea how things work (ahem) around these parts. \n\nYou, if you’re not Muslim and want to actually drink alcohol, you must pay the Emirate for that “right”. You pony up to the local constabulary a fee that gets you your ‘liquor license’ which awards you the capacity to pay 30% over cost for a limited variety of highish-octane potables. Got that? It’s either that, drink in more expensive hotels (and take a cab afterwards; never, ever drink-drive) or go dry. \n\nWell, we don’t go dry and we don’t do hotels (We’re rough-n-tough Oilmen, and we’ll drink what we want when we want. If that’s OK with you, that is…) so we decided a pre-bowl game trip to the bottle shop was in order. So, in keeping with the narrative, that’s exactly what we did. \n\nThe bottle shops in this part of town are located cheek-by-jowl inside of some of the world-famous huge malls located here. So, our booze run became a run to the ‘Mall of The Local Region’; transporting not only ourselves, but my mate’s 2 adult-aged twin daughters (who happen to be: 1. Out of school on break, and 2. Out of the military on furlough). \n\nDaughter 1 (the shyer, more demure) of the pair, accompanies us to the bottle shop as she’s had enough of the Mall of the Damned and wants a tipple for herself. Daughter 2, (the less shy, much more military of the pair) decides to swing in to a shoe store to pick up something more comfortable than her usual GI footware. \n\nWe park and part company, moving swiftly and surely to the grogshop with Daughter 1 while Daughter 2 goes to one of the 150 shoe stores in the mall. \n\nWhile in the liquor store, one of the non-local (Eastern Expat) employees decides that Daughter 1 is insanely beautiful and he must possess her no matter the number of camels it took. In other words, he was a brazen pest and rather much like many of the denizens of the area, way too touchy-feely for this group of Westerners. \n\nRemembering Daughter 1 is rather shy and not keen on interpersonal invasion, she stuck close to us as we generally shooed the cretin away and kept him more or less at bay. He wouldn’t shut up which contributed to increased general uneasiness so we curtailed our perusing activities, chose our particular brand of overpriced giggle water, paid and briskly departed. \n\nBack at the car, Daughter 2 (dressed near identically to daughter 1) has found and purchased her shoes, but wanted to pick up a couple of bottles of wine for dinner. Since we’re here and know of the potential lothario inside, Daughter 1 opts to wait in the car while the remainder of our sortie swoop back to the shop for a quick search &amp; re-supply mission. \n\nUpon ingress, we note the shifty-swarthy-seedy employee is in the back room. \n\nWe breathe a collective sigh of relief and head to the Wall of Wine to locate an appropriate brand of elderly grape juice. Debates escalated over the dinner’s fare and which wine color (Beige?) would best go with the meal when a very stealthy shifty-swarthy-seedy employee grabs Daughter 2 from the back and grasping her shoulder, attempts to spin her around so she can receive the full up-close and in person HD effect of his undying love…\n\nThere are several things through life that one really shouldn’t do…don’t tug on Superman’s cape, don’t spit into the wind, you don't pull the mask off that old lone ranger, and you don't mess around with someone fresh from Kandahar Province.\n\nObviously startled, Marine training instantly kicks in. \nWhile filling out the accident report for this idiot, and after finding most of his teeth, the damage report was more or less a laundry list of things on the human body that yield great debilitating pain very quickly and relay to the owner that they’ve made a huge, no, monumental mistake. \n\nIn any culture, ‘no’ means ‘no’.  Here it means FUCK NO!\n\nTL; DR. Asswipe gets overly friendly with a case of mistaken identity. Traumerity ensues.\n",

There’s a guy that works there quite often, and he’s known for being rude to customers and having a terrible attitude - which I can honestly sympathize with, because he deals with a lot of shit every day (Kids coming in and trying to play pool for free, messing with arcade games and such)\n\nHowever, to play darts, you need a loonie or a toon or (1 dollar or two dollar coin). Quarters or anything less don’t work. So my friend and I have exhausted our supply of loonies and toonies, and we don’t want to break the bills we have. Fortunately, I carry around a little coin pouch with small coins in it to pay for parking and such.\n\nSo I walk up to the front table and I ask for a loonie in return for the change I have in my hand - about 9 dimes and 2 nickels.

I’ve never heard of that before.”\n\nHe replies hafheartedly, “yeah. Anyways, you just have too many coins there, I can’t take them. Sorry” and he turns around and ignores me. \n\nSo me and my friend leave the place, and I’m still quite perturbed... That’s honestly the worst excuse I’ve ever heard for not wanting to go through the hassle of just switching coins. ",

I have a military ID that gets me a discount at a place up the street, so we decided that would be a great way to end our year. \n\n11:00am is when they opened. I called at 11:15 asking about delivery by 1:00. The employee told me the earliest delivery they had was 2, and that was just too late. I agreed I would just pick it up at 1, and gave them my order. It was a large pizza with 3 toppings and a platter that included wings, veggies, fried veggies etc. I’ve ordered it dozens of times. \n\nMe: large pizza family combo. Pepperoni on the whole thing, half with bacon and the other half with pineapple. \n\nHer: so a large half pep and pineapple, half pep and bacon?  Plus the wing platter? That will be $42.xx after taxes. \n\nMe: correct! I’ll see you at one! \n\n1pm comes around so I take my lunch break to get the pizza. I get there and see my pizza is completely wrong. One side was plain pep, the other side was pep, pineapple and bacon. I bring this up to the cashier. Not the same one who took my order earlier. \n\nHim: oh, well that’s not what it says on the order form. You must have said it wrong. \n\nMe: no, I double checked. The one who took my order this morning read it back exactly how I ordered it. This is your mess up\n\nHim: fine, we will throw this one on the buffet line and make you another one. But it will be another 15 minutes. \n\nAfter checking my receipt, I notice I’ve been overcharged. Instead of giving me a discount for the package, I was charged individually. I bring this up with him again\n\nMe: I noticed you charged me separately for the pizza and wing platter. I should have received the combo discount and military. Why is it so much? Look, 17.99 for the pizza, and 21 for the platter is equal to the $38, but there on the menu it says that I should have been charged only $32, not including taxes. With taxes, minus my military discount, it should not have gone over 35. I’ve been here a lot and never order anything different. Why is it so much more?\n\nHim: ah, well, you see, it’s because of the way you ordered your pizza. That’s 3 toppings, and you didn’t want it to cover the pizza, only one side, and that’s the price it’s supposed to be anyway. You’re obviously not including the taxes or putting in the right discounts. \n\nI tell him to make a fake order doing the regular combo special, plus taxes. He sees that it comes to around 38, then I ask him to take the military discount and it goes down to $34. He continues to give me attitude trying to convince me that I wasn’t overcharged. When he prints out the new fake order, it comes out to exactly what I’ve paid in the past. He then tells me “well, it’s just a few dollars difference. Is it really that big of a deal you were overcharged when you didn’t order the right way? It would take 3-5 business days to get your refund anyway”\n\nI lost it. “listen, I worked at a pizza place last year. I admitted my mistakes and did everything in my power to make the customer happy again, offering free dessert or drinks, and I gave them the messed up pizza and offered a fresh correct pizza. I never accused my customers of lying to me about their order. You’ve done everything opposite of what a good employee should do when a customer is upset. I’ve been nice. I didn’t want to be a bad customer when you messed up my pizza, costing me my entire lunch break to fix your mistake. Now you’re calling me a liar about being overcharged? Where’s the manager?!”\n\nHe then tells me he’s the supervisor and that the manager won’t be in til the new year. All I got out of that was a fountain drink. I will never order from them again. ",

        "text": "So this story happened around a year ago. Pokemon Sun and Moon is coming out today , so I scoot over to my local video game store to buy a copy of the newest instalment of a beloved game franchise. Might be important to note that the store I was heading is a small store in a mall, not a huge retail location that can staffs dozens of employees. All video game on display are empty boxes for show only: you have to ask at the counter on one.\nSo since it's release day, of course there's quite a line at the store, forking in two as it nears the counter. Two cashier, one who I know as the manager, are just working their butts off, delivering the prized cartridges to their clients.\n\nFlash forward 15 minutes. I have passed the fork in the line and there is only 2 or 3 clients separating me from the manager and my new video game. The other line however, is being held by a mother one her cellphone. Her kid, around 6 or 7, is noisily dancing and jumping around, singing \"I'm getting Pokemon Sun! I'm getting Pokemon Sun!\". Somewhat annoying, but hey, I willing to accept it's just because he is super excited because he's about to get his new video game. Honestly, it was more adorable than anything, like a slightly calmer version of the nintendo 64 kid. The only obstacle in his path is the mother, who is ignoring the poor, shy cashier and her pleas of \"Miss, can I help you\" choosing instead to hush her down with a rude hand gesture everytime she spoke (No, not the bird. You know that quick downward flick of the wrist that means \"Shut up!\"), clearly way too focused on her current cellphone conversation.\n\nSo anyways, now comes my turn. Manager informs me that they still have copies of both Sun and Moon. I don't really have a preference, but I've found that the Sun-exclusif Pokemon are cooler, so I ask for Sun. Manager leaves to fetch my copy. Seconds before he returns, cellphone mom hangs up, and also demands a Pokemon Sun cartridge.\n\nNo sooner has the shy lady turned around that the manager emerges from the backroom, holding my soon to be copy of Pokemon Sun, saying \"You're in luck, this is the last one.\" Him and the other cashier share a micro-second of an awkward glance, and shy cashier turns around to apologizes to cellphone mom, the last copy of Sun has been sold, but they still have a few copies of Moon left.\n\nNow I decide to cut in and say \"Know what, I'm going to buy Moon instead, you can give them the last copy of Sun\". I mean, sure the mother held the line for 10 minutes with her cellphone, but that kid just seemed so eager to be getting Pokemon Sun. I was willing to ignore her transgression to see that kid happy.\n\nI got to say \"I'm going to buy Moon ins...\" before cellphone mom just explodes. Who dare they not stock enough games? What kind of customer service is this? Do you realize how disappointed her kid was going to be? What did of retarded manager staffs a store with such incompetent (not quite was she said, but similar enough). The kid on the other hand, was taking it like a champ. I was expecting some tears, but honestly he just looked embarrassed. I think that he knew his mom was to blame. Cellphone mom is PISSED. I've had rage quits fighting Bloodbourne bosses that didn't quite reach her level of frustration. The poor shy cashier looked like she just wanted to crawl under the counter and wait for that tornado to pass. Instead she just stood rigid and took it all. Kinda looked like the drill sergeant scene in Full Metal Jacket, except replace the recruits with a 16-ish girl who's probably on her first retail job to save for her first car, and the sergeant by an overweight mother. The usual threats poured out: I'm reporting you to management, to the parent company, I'm telling all my Facebook friends to not shop here. The manager just had a neutral expression, but deep down you know that he wanted to toss out cellphone mom like a bouncer tosses out the drunkards. Me, I was just standing there wide-eyed. Should I try to intervene and try to calm this fury? Questions that will remained unanswered, as cellphone mom stormed out, kid tugging at her pants, asking if they could get Moon instead, only to be answered with a stern \"We are not spending money in THIS! store!\".\n\nTL;DR? Rude mother holds up the line on her cellphone, then flips her shit learning that the last copy of Pokemon Sun has just been sold, ignores the kind soul who would have let her have the last copy, makes a scene, and leaves Pokemon-less and with a disappointed child.\nMy sympathies to the staff and that poor kid. Hope you got your copy of Pokemon Sun without suffering any more embarrassments.",

        "text": "I just found this sub today and thought I would share an experience I had about a year ago on a certain online store that’s named after a certain rain forest ... for the sake of the store we’ll call the online store OS.\n\nLast year, for my birthday, my aunt who lives across the country asked me what I wanted for my once-a-year gift. Not really thinking about it, I told her to surprise me. My aunt has never really been the kind to put a lot of effort into gift-giving, even for her kids, so I wasn’t very surprised when she sent me an OS gift card for $150. \n\n“Sweet!” I thought, I could order some books I had been looking at and have money left over to get myself something nice. So after ordering my books, which cost me about $30, I had $120 left over to get myself something “nice”. So here’s the point where I mention I’ve always wanted a nice pair of brand-name shoes, but had never gotten myself a pair because even on sale they normally cost a ton. \n\nAfter a bit of looking around, I found a pair of dark-grey suede Prada ankle boots. In the pictures they looked black, but were specifically listed as grey. I know, I know, one should never order any high-end brand online unless it’s from a legitimate source. I know that now. But a year go, I was more naive on the subject. I saw the cute little anklets and thought they would be perfect for my winter trip to New York, and I could show my aunt what she had helped me buy with the gift card she sent me. I looked at the reviews of the third-party store (from now on known as Shitty Store Front or SSF), and they had nearly 5 stars! All the reviews below that were for small things like not delivering on time or not hearing back from the selling right away. I did some more research and saw that the high-end department store in my area were selling the shoes for $650 (the retail price) while the shoes listed on SSF were only $360 (should have been my second red flag, I know). To top it all off, the shoes were listed under the OS “prime” option, so I had extra faith in the SSF. \n\nI was so giddy waiting for my shoes to come in. Since they were “prime” I got my shoes within days. I opened the oversized cardboard box and eagerly opened the shoe box with “PRADA” elegantly written on the top. When I removed all of the tissue I immediately saw that the color of the shoes were less “dark grey/black” and more just “grey”, but hey, maybe the color on my screen just made the shoes look black. And then I noticed it — the bottom of the shoes in my hand were completely different from the picture being displayed on my screen. The screen showed six rows of thick black lines with “PRADA” written in the middle. Instead, the shoes I had multiple thinner rows that were rounded with a separation in the middle which had the designer name... nothing like the bottom of the actual designer shoe. And there was another issue, unlike the shoes in the picture, there was no designer name on the side of the soles, it was all flat. I had bought a fake. It hit me how dumb it was to think I could get such a good deal from an online vendor. I took another look at the SSF’s review page and found that they actually *did* have bad reviews, but because it was “prime” the one star reviews had all been crossed out and written something along the lines of \n*”because this item was under OS prime, we take responsibility for this review”* there were HUNDREDS of these one star reviews, and maybe half were claiming that the items they received were fake. Upset that I had just bought a counterfeit item, I wrote a review on both SSF’s page and on the item itself exposing them for selling me counterfeit shoes. I took pictures of my shoes’ soles versus the shoes they had pictures of as well as the pictures from the department store. \n\nNot 20 minutes later I get a call from an out-of-state number. To my surprise, it’s a man with a heavy Italian accent yelling at the top of his lungs. \n(MOTP = man on the phone / ME = me)\n\nMOTP: “Who the fuck do you think you are?”\nME: “excuse me?”\nMOTP: “Who the fuck do you think you are leaving that review on my page?!”\n\nI quickly realize that this man must run SSF and am surprised that he has my number.\n\nME: “how did you get my phone number?”\nMOTP: “I’ll have you know I get those shoes directly from designer stores. I know people high up who work at OS and you will be sorry if you don’t take down those reviews. I will have your account shut down and you will never be able to use OS again!” \nME: “if the shoes were real, then show me an example from the designer where the soles are like the ones you sent. I can’t find any; they are all flat, not rounded”\nMOTP: “I don’t have to do that for you, they are real, I got them myself, I have nothing to prove to you!”\n\nHe went on a little more about how I needed to take down the review and some more about how he knew the shoes were real because he had bought them himself of course! How dare I not believe him while he screams at me. The part that scared me was just that; he had all of my information right in front of him. My name, my phone number, and address were all attached to my OS account. \n\nAfter a couple moments to calm down, I called the OS customer service to report what had just happened. The lady seemed apathetic to my claims but immediately refunded me anyway, as I saw my gift card’s balance return to $120. They considered the case closed. \n\nBut it wasn’t over yet! 3 days later I received another screaming call from the same man from a number with the same area code but different number demanding that I return the shoes to them as they had also received a note saying I had been refunded. They had also somehow gotten the online store to delete my reviews on both their page as well as the product itself (maybe due to getting a refund?). However, to my delight and a few back and forth with OS customer service via email, I found out that I did not have to return the shoes to Shitty StoreFront! So fuck the guy who called and threatened me and SSF’s counterfeit products! I hope not getting the shoes back cost them and they were able to scam one less person.\n\nAnd needless to say I removed my cellphone number from my OS account and never bought shoes from an untrustworthy third party vendor again! \n\nSorry this turned out so long and thanks for reading! (: \n\n**TLDR;** Naively bought designer shoes online from a third party seller, turned out to be counterfeit, the owner of the third party storefront called and threatened me. I called the customer service from the platform they were selling from, got refunded and got to keep the shoes, causing the counterfeiters to suffer $360 loss. \n",

        "text": "I want to preface this by saying that I worked in big name cosmetics store where suggestive selling is a huge component of their technique.  So I understand why they do it, but damn some stores don't get it.\n\nI went into a store which carries their own clothing brand today.  I was one of the only people there, and looking specifically for pants - particularly palazzo pants and polished trousers, which I handed to the associate when they came by to but the stuff I selected into the fitting room.  Now, in every single experience I've had in their locations across my city, not once has any associate bothered to really get to know why/what I'm shopping for, but generally they're at least able to ascertain my size, zero in on my color pallet, or make recommendations that at least will complement the rest of my clothes.  I either ignore the item or ask if it comes in black if its a style I like but in the wrong color.\n\nI wear XS, only black, and would consider myself to be pretty on trend, so today when I saw a bright green, loose fit loungewear shirt amongst my dressy pants in size medium, all I could do was just abandon my fitting room without trying anything on.  Not only was it something I wouldn't even sleep in, it wasn't even something that went with the pants.  I have no idea why the associate recommended it because it wasn't even linked to anything.\n\n*I was the only customer in the store.*  She had plenty of time to find out my preferences and size (I mean she could have also just looked at me/the clothes I got).  Instead of asking me anything, or observing what I was grabbing, she chatted with the cashier.  I mean why bother doing suggestive selling if you're not even gonna do it right?\n\nIt's not really about her clothing choice, but when suggestive selling goes wrong, its ***sooooo*** obviously a sales attempt - and while I don't need to have the associates worship the ground I walk on, I also don't need to feel like someone's personal barbie or an anonymous money machine.",
