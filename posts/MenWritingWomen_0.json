I would give anything to sit down with George and ask him just one simple thing. *How Dare You!!!*\n\nHow dare you write about themes such as misogyny in a patriarchal society, the horrors of war or stripping fantasy genre of its romantic notions of an idealized past which never existed? How dare you write about topics that are intentionally meant to be disturbing? Don't you know that this might be upsetting to the reader/viewer, and as we all know the only kind of emotions art should elicit is are warm and fuzzy ones, and nothing else? Oh you think that only thing worth writing about is \"only the human heart in conflict with itself\". Geez, what a nice pretentious excuse you cooked up for yourself you misogynistic creep!\n\nIt's about time someone puts their foot down and let Martin and writers like him know that enough is enough!!! These authors needs to learn that literature is meant to escapist wish-fulfillment and not \"explorations on human nature\" or whatever bullshit these misogynists has to offer as a defense. George R.R. Martin, and writers like him should learn that literature is only meant to be wholesome and comforting. Anything else, anything that wants to explore darker and more complex topics, well to that I say we have a responsibility to call these works out as the sexist trash they are, and I'm happy to say that this sub is doing a fine job of that already. Good job, and let me just say I'm so proud of this community. Keep this up and one day we will relegate the fantasy genre, and literature overall to be nothing more than warm and fuzzy escapism and nothing else.\n\n&gt;!rj/ Satire for anyone to dumb to get it!&lt;",

        "text": "There is an abundance of qoutes here from authors who write about sexy women. There is of course, nothing wrong with being a sexy woman. There is however something problematic with having female characters whose existance is predicated on being sexy. Obviously giving depth to the character is a must for any good story. \n\nI've also noticed a habit of first introductions being posted here frequently. First impressions matter a great deal, in real life and in in fiction, so if the *first* thing you see of a character is that they have long legs and big boobies, those things will be emphasized as more important. A leggy buxom girl should have more traits that make her appealing and memorable to the reader (and not to mention give her a sense of agency).\n\nFurthermore, the sexyness should play a role in *her* character as well, not just in whose looking at her. Her sexyness should reflect the choices she's made and her circumstances as dictated by setting, culture etc. In real life, women do enjoy being sexy and being seen as sexy, for their own reasons. An author should not write a female character with a very low cut blouse just for a male audience if said character would find it immodest otherwise.\n\nAny other ideas?",
