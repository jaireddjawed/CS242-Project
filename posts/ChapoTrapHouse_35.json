        "text": "So about a week or two ago, I was sexually assaulted/raped. \n\nI went out to the bar. Had a few drinks. And then my memory started to get fuzzy. I don't recall closing my tab. I don't recall the name of who did it. I barely recall what they looked like. I know that I didn't consent to the oral sex. I was significantly short on the amount of cash that I went out with. \n\nBut I know that I gave away information that revealed my vulnerability. I told them that my phone was dead for example. \n\nNow for the first day or so, I was in denial. I'm a big guy, the spotty memory was beacuse of the alcohol, I'm bi, so that means I probably wanted it. But I couldn't shake the negative feelings. I couldn't give a good reason for why I was missing so much money. So I called RAINN. They transferred me to local hotline. One staffed with volunteers. Volunteers that I have nothing against and am grateful for, but nonetheless they rightly told me that they weren't qualified to discuss my situation that deeply. So I was still left in doubt. I didn't know for sure, and didn't want to admit it. This uncertainty lead me to not go into the ER when I should have. It caused me to waste precious time as far as collecting evidence goes. After a round or two of phone tag I talked to an actual staff member at the local crisis center and set up an appointment with a counselor, during the first week of October. \n\nThis is a long time to wait though, so I talked to some good friends, and they said my story didn't sound right. That it did sound like I was raped. That it did match up with accounts of being roofied that they had heard. The validation of my feelings was nice, but they were only friends, not professionals. They can't fill the role of a professional. \n\nIf this was a episode of Last Week Tonight, this is where he'd tell you to vote for Democrats and increase pressure so that these resources have more funding that allows them to have better hours and staffing. \n\nBut that's not going to happen. Helping rape victims isn't directly profitable. As long as profit is the biggest driver of social change, people in my situation will be left behind. We underpay workers that deal with them beacuse we can take advantage of the kindness that they have. We staff the hotlines with volunteers and a script beacuse they don't produce revenue. It's fucking sick. And as long as we have capitalism, especially the craven American version, this will continue to happen. \n\nSo the next time that a liberal tries to shame you for \"risking progress on social issues\" tell them to fuck off. They don't know what they're talking about. ",
