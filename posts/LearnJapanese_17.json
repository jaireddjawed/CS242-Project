I thought to myself that I could just take it next year and re-learn what I took in Japanese 101 on my own time. Unfortunately, I didn't keep myself accountable and didn't relearn anything, now I start Japanese 102 in a few days, and I'm wondering if I should even take it. I've been thinking of dropping the class since it's not my major and is just something I've been interested in. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Is it realistic to do well in Japanese 102 despite nearly forgetting everything in 101?",

I can already see some people might be infuriated without any reason, I just want to know, though.\n\nIt appears to me like Japanese learning is much more popular than learning Chinese. I do wonder, why?\n\nLike, from what I know (I don't speak either) both Chinese and Japanese are extremely difficult to learn for a native speaker of an Indo-European language. However, Chinese has like 10 times as many native speakers. So if you invest all that time into learning Chinese, you are likely to be able to speak to many times as many people.\n\nOn top of that, China has nukes and is more likely to become a superpower. \n\nI wonder, why exactly is Japanese learning more popular?\n\nWhy have you chosen Japanese instead of Chinese? What drove you to it? Do you think Japanese more useful?",

My biggest complains are:\n\n1. Need to look deeply to find…\n2. If you find it, you'll probably need to look at diff resources to understand it and…\n3. Probably, they don't have a visual example so you'll get a catch **even without explanation**.\n\n**Visual clues**\n\nHaving a visual explanation for words / grammar it's really really useful. At least for me, I get better if I see a conversation rather than reading a grammar point (plus I hate this). There was too long ago I started with an anime project where I collected the most common words + most common real-life words… To make a visual dictionary of them!\n\nI already posted this on Reddit but sorry… I had no time so I stopped working on it but it's only less than 700 words left (of 2500 words) so hopefully I'll finish soon.\n\nI'm a visual learner. I mean… I can really REALLY remember every single word of a TV show I like as I if I were reading the script. I'm better remembering sounds and visual clues than what I read. That's the reason why I started that anime project and why I started this onomatopoeia project.\n\n**The Onomatodict project**\n\n[You can find it here](https://github.com/matsumurae/onomatodict-jp). As I said this is still under development, so please don't be too harsh!\n\nThis is made in English + Spanish but if you want to collaborate, feel free to submit a PR on Github.\n\nAt first you'll find the homepage, where you'll get to know the diff between onomatopoeias. If you go to /dict/ folder, you'll see the available words distributed alphabetically in folders. Let's say you go to N folder… There you'll see all the available words arranged alphabetically.\n\nIf you click on the word that interests you, you'll see (English and Spanish below: \n\n1. An image describing the word (I try to get them from manga but sometimes it's hard to find them, so I'll collect while I read them)\n2. Video and / or sound if they're available.\n3. Meaning, type, category (this is used for JSON categorizing, because I plan to make this a website), equivalence.\n4. Usage and examples\n\n**Notes**\n\nI'm not native Japanese nor studying Japanese linguistics. This is my own personal project and I thought it could be useful to post it public on Github.\n\nIf you want to collaborate, feel free to open a PR or submit an issue. If you don't know how to use Github, just write me and I'll help you!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10gofpk/some_stuff_on_kanji_as_a_native_chinese_speaker/",
        "text": "Welp, when I got a chance to learn a language during the MCOs, I selected Japanese because it had kanji thinking it was the same as Chinese. Boy, I was wrong...  \nStuff aside, here are some information on kanji.  \n\n\n1. **It's Origins**  \nJapan originally did not even had a writing system. Meanwhile, China's economy was booming at that time that it was regarded as a strong country. Japan, wanting to learn a thing or two from China, sent scholars to China to learn there. The scholars then brought back the characters from China to Japan.  \nWay far back, before the Shang dynasty, the Chinese invented their characters based off pictures, called Oracle Bone Script, as they were originally carved on turtle shells for divination. We aren't sure who invented this system, but it's Cangjie according to folklore. These characters would later be improved for better carvings on bronze stuff, bamboo strips, unified into one system by Qin Shi Huang in the Qin dynasty, and by the time Japan learnt about them, they were improved majorly in the Han dynasty.  \n\n2. **How on earth do they even determine it's pronunciations!?**  \nFirstly, we've got the kun'yomi, which is the native Japanese reading. After the Japanese got them from China, they found similar concepts in both the Chinese and Japanese words, so they unified them in a single kanji. Take the number 3 for example. みつ is what they were using this entire time before they learnt about Chinese characters. Next, we've got the on'yomi.  They are pronunciations bought back from China by the scholars. We have 3 types of on'yomi: the Wu Dynasty pronunciation, 呉音, the oldest out of these 3; the Tang Dynasty pronunciation, 漢音; and the Song Dynasty pronunciation, 唐音, being the closest to modern Chinese as it's the latest dynasty they borrowed the pronunciations from in this list. Let's look at the kanji 明. It's on'yomi are みょう (Wu), めい (Tang), and みん (Song). It's Chinese pronunciation is Ming, and try to compare this to the other pronunciations! I'm sure you'll find the Song dynasty as the closest!  \n\n3. **The Radicals**  \nThe first person in recorded history to use radicals to sort through Chinese characters was Xu Zhen in the Eastern Han Dynasty, who actually created the first dictionary in this language. Stuff aside, radicals often cover the meaning of compound kanji (which I'll explain later), making it easy to guess the kanji's meaning. The 亻 radical has stuff to do with humans, 貝 money (people used cowrie shells as currency in the past), 氵 water, 灬 fire, and many more. They usually come in 7 forms, which are: へん (on the left, like 亻), つくり (on the right, like 刂), かんむり (on the top, like 艹), あし (on the bottom, like 灬), かまえ (surrounding characters, like 囗), たれ (hanging on the top left, like 疒), and finally にょう (chilling in the bottom left, like 辶).  \n\n4. **How the heck did they even make these characters!?**  \na. By looking at stuff then drawing them down. Stuff like 山, 人, and etc.  \nb. By using symbols to indicate stuff. Like 本, 上, and etc.  \nc. By combining radicals and characters that make the same pronunciation to form new words. Such as, 園 (the 囗 shows us that it's related to compounds or something, and 袁 denotes the pronunciation, which is えん.)  \nd. By combining 2 characters to denote meanings. For instance, 明, 名, and etc.  \nThere are 2 more ways actually, but I won't put them here because I'm not convinced that these 2 are actually methods of making characters.  \n\n5. **Simplification Methods**  \nWelp, the Japanese simplified a lot of these characters, way before the Chinese actually simplified them. I'll show you guys some examples down here.  \na. Simplified similarly  \nb. Changed radicals in China  \nc. Simplified differently  \nd. Straight up not simplified in Japan  \nThere are actually way more methods, but I won't include them due to me being lazy.  \n\n\n|Traditional|Japan's|China's|Method|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|萬|万|万|a|\n|銀|銀|银|b|\n|圓|円|圆|c|\n|飛|飛|飞|d|\n\n  \n\n\n1. **Kanji made in Japan**  \nNow, the Japanese actually created some kanjis by themselves for stuff they have in Japan but not in China. These are actually quite rare, but here are some examples down here: 畑, 働, 鰯, 峠. Worth nothing that some of these characters made their way into Chinese dictionaries thanks to Japanese names and ideas the Chinese thought were genius.  \n\n2. **Meanings**  \nAlthough most of these characters have the same meaning in Chinese, some have different meanings due to how Japanese is based off classical Chinese. In fact, classical Chinese is vastly different than modern Chinese it's a chore to learn. Anyways, here are some of them in action:   \n\n\n|Character|Japanese|Chinese|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|床|floor|bed|\n|私|I|private|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Kanjis that shouldn't exist but they do anyways**  \nDuring the heyday of Japanese character encodings, the workers were trying their best to include characters from various places, such as place names, textbook characters, and stuff. These characters were created due to errors, like a photocopy error, messy handwriting, and others. These characters are known as 幽霊文字, and 彁 along with 妛 are notable examples of that.  \n\n2. **The connection of Hiragana and Katakana with Kanji**   \nHiragana evolved from cursive kanji and Katakana was created by selecting components from kanjis. At that time, a lot of these kanji were used instead as kana known as 万葉仮名. Katakana was created first, followed by hiragana.  \n\n\nThat's it for my kanji studies. I'll update this post if I have new discoveries in kanji. See ya!",

Personally, I am done with tests. I was sort of glad that I got the test stuffs over (for certificate purposes). Studying JLPT N1 definitely helped me with vocabulary, but I don't think I have the energy within me anymore (to study for any more tests).\n\nI have heard some people say \"I got JLPT N1.

But i'm excited to try to read/watch some real media.\n\nRealistically, at what point should i attempt to consume some real japanese media? Should i aim to complete all of Genki I? All of Genki II? \n\n Lastly, can you recommend some manga and TV for beginners when i finally reach that point?",

The practice questions and corrections seem sufficient for learning the grammar and words in the book but it's pretty much just asking or answering a question. It's not a conversation that I'm having practice with. Maybe I'll be able to build upto it later on. \n\nMy teacher usually asks me the same basic things every lesson for 15 mins. how are you, what date is it, what did you do yesterday, what are your plans today. Then sometimes asks me can you say this in Japanese? basically getting me to use prior words and grammar point I've learnt.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone's ever learnt Japanese from doing mainly conversation lessons. I had a couple before where the teacher can introduce some new words, grammar and phrases but tries to speak at your level. I'm thinking it may be more fun than what I'm doing if it will work for me.",

Here you can copy/paste the text or portions of the text to store later or immediately create a card/note for in your SRS app of choice.\n\nI recently started playing Persona 5 with full immersion, and this has helped me greatly enjoy the game while not burdening myself with having to try and find every single Kanji (no furigana). Just in the start screen I got a valuable sentence structure and new vocabulary words: ネットワークに接続していると、ゲーム内で様々な機能が利用できます。\n\nThis sentence took 10 seconds to snap, copy/paste, and store in my SRS.
