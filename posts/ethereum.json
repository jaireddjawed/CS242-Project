If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThe best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit \/r\/ethstaker for more details\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added?

NFTBOOKS can precisely use the NFT features to address the Authors' most underlined issue of duplication & ownership being compromised. In NFTBOOKS, the ownership of a book is in the form of an NFT & is recorded on the blockchain, and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded. Each NFT has a unique smart contract and hence proponents of NFTs can claim a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership.\n\nCHEAP BOOKS FOR READERS FROM LENDERS \n\nWhoever owns a book or multiple books can create a personal library with NFTBOOKS and can lend them to readers for rent. The availability of many such personally owned libraries with NFTBOOKS can create competition among lenders to lend books at the cheapest cost and hence, readers can go to the cheapest available book on the NFT marketplace of NFTBOOKS and on every resale or borrowing Royalty Income could be generated for original creator. \n\nNO MIDDLEMAN \n\nUnlike existing online self publishing platforms (for example Amazon) where huge royalty income goes to the platform, with NFTBOOKS, authors can receive up to 99% the price of their books.\n\nROYALTY (PERPETUAL) Earnings FOR AUTHORS \n\nAn NFT can give the Royalty Earnings to the ORIGINAL CREATOR every time it gets transferred to a new buyer. How? \n\nEach NFT can be registered with its own percentage of Royalty Earnings when the smart contract is deployed. And hence, every time a book is resold from one person to another, a certain percentage of Royalty Earnings (decided before the book is published) go to the Original Creator of that NFT (BOOK). Which will result in maximizing the authors' income.\n\n Really excited to share, One such Project is already there on Polygon Network and listed on CoinMarketCap named as NFTBOOKS.","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1678690903.0},{"title":"Goerli","author":"Rivercoaster","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/11pxvw3\/goerli\/","text":"Can anyone send me some Goerli or point me in the right direction about of an active faucet to get some \n\n0x8c8530b8D2DBed5095F3e9448BBA744ACE6fC34D","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1678675464.0},{"title":"Can anyone explain the mechanics of what happened to DAI?","author":"edmundedgar","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/11p9kns\/can_anyone_explain_the_mechanics_of_what_happened\/","text":"So I think I used to understand how DAI worked, ie you'd sell what was effectively a promise of $1 worth of ETH in the future and put up more than $1 of ETH as collateral, and if the price of ETH dropped too much you'd have to add some, and if you didn't do that it would force-sell your collateral.\n\nI also understand the idea that as well as ETH, you could have other collateral which worked the same way.\n\nBut what's going on now seems to involves some kind of \"pool\" thing and a \"stability module\" and various other clevers.

This is bad, and you should feel bad. Let's use Rai more, and here's a way to do it.\n\n# USDC is a crutch\n\nRecent events with Dai and USDC prove yet again why stablecoins backed by USD are toxic assets. The reality, [as Arthur Hayes put it](https:\/\/youtu.be\/vSvVkm7gViE?t=2518), is that DeFi will always be hamstrung if we depend on US dollar stability. It introduces centralization risks, and also draws the ire of regulators who want bond stability. When you realize all liquid stablecoins are backed mostly by US treasury bonds, guarded by centralized commercial banks, you realize just how this house of cards can fall. When certain market conditions are met, the bonds are liquidated at market rates, where you may receive $0.94 on every dollar.\n\n**Oh wait, that's what just happened**\n\nYou can do research on bond mechanics and how the combination of Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank destroyed the value of USDC, but look no further than the PSM on Dai to see how destructive this crutch is. [It currently stands at 63% USDC](https:\/\/daistats.com\/#\/overview) as everyone panic sold USDC for Dai to get out of fears that Circle was undercollateralized, [which it turns out they are](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/blog\/an-update-on-usdc-and-silicon-valley-bank). \n\n# Stop using USDC challenge\n\nNow here's the hard part. I know you want to larp as a decentralization maxi, but it's time to stop it and actually be a decentralization maxi. Here's how you can do it.\n\n## As a user\n\nAs a user, how can you promote Rai? By actually using Rai. Instead of going to conferences and larping about how great ETH is, but then splitting bills with Venmo, why don't use use Rai?\n\n- Buy some Rai\n- Use it to split bills with other DeFi native people.\n\nI understand risks that it could go down, so just use Rai in a small fashion just to get used to it. You don't need to go crazy and buy $100K in Rai, but keep a small amount on a layer 2 and slosh it around.\n\n## As a DeFi trader.\n\nBig bag boys, have I got news for you. Rai is currently paying you to generate it. As it stands, it has [over 4% APY](https:\/\/stats.reflexer.finance\/) to mint new RAI. How does it work? [The stability peg is currently negative](https:\/\/medium.com\/reflexer-labs\/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd).\n\n- Make a Reflexer Safe and generate Rai. Long ETH using Reflexer bonds.\n- Take the Rai and market make with it. Preferably on L2s.\n\nNow here's the interesting part? Want leverage? Use DeFi Saver to mint new RAI and rebuy ETH. [You can do this in 1 swap and have some good capital efficiency](https:\/\/app.defisaver.com\/reflexer\/manage).\n\n## As a Project Owner\n\nThis is an interesting part. You're a project owner, so you have sweet yield farming rewards for people who want to use your project. I want to ask, why are you using anything else but Rai as the base token in your project? Why are you doing ICOs with USDC? Why is your NFT project selling in Dai\/USDC and not even giving the option for Rai? Rai is right there. Use it. Help bootstrap Rai liquidity. Why should you do this you ask? Well even if you complain about the possibility of Rai going down in value, considering this weekend USDC dropped to $0.88, you clearly do not have the safety you think you have. You have just as much volatility risk as Rai already, except you also have the trust risk where you hope to god Circle or the Bitfinex Cartel actually has the bonds they say they do. You are effectively ignoring your risks, while Rai's risks are right in front of you and clear. You're just risking your project, and may wake up one day with $0.50 on every USDC. Here's an idea:\n\n- Stop doing token raises with USDC. Use Rai.\n- Generate yield farm liquidity with Rai. Preferably run your yield farm programs on L2s so general users can access Rai.\n- Promote Rai. Use Rai as payment tokens for your merch. Support Rai in your app as a base token. Use Rai as a payment for conferences. Enjoy Rai within your organization and offer it as salaries.\n\n# Fin\n\nIf you've made it this far, I hope you're now thinking. You're all far too deep into USD stablecoins, and you don't realize you are not supporting decentralized finance. Every USD has a link to a commercial US bank, regulated by the government, and will always be crutched by regulators who manage bond volatility. The next few weeks, you will see people use the recent bank failures as an excuse to regulate these tokens further, as they are directly linked to US treasuries markets. This is foolish. Simplify your risks. Rai is risky, but it's simplified risks backed by pure ETH.\n\n**We need you to help promote Rai**\n\nThe hard part? You're not going to get rich doing it. It's not like promoting your digital beanie babies or new yield farm. It won't make you a token billionaire. No one is making a yield farm strategy for Rai, because it's already mostly crystalized. The project owners aren't going to get rich from it, and neither will you. It's an already deployed token, that has been in the wild for over a year, that's just sitting there waiting for you to realize it's use. Use it.\n\n# A note from Satoshi\n\nThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.

This is not surprising, considering the numerous benefits that the Ethereum blockchain offers over others imo. \n\nSome of the key benefits of the Ethereum blockchain include:\n\n* **Smart contract functionality**: Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to introduce smart contracts which allows for the automation of complex business and financial processes without the need for intermediaries. \n* **Developer community**: Ethereum has one of the largest and most active developer communities which has resulted in the creation of a number of libraries, tools and frameworks making it easier for gaming developers to build here. \n* **Flexibility**: Ethereum is a highly flexible platform which allows the creation of a wide range of dApps going beyond financial applications and towards the gaming sector too, making it more ideal.  \n* **Interoperability**: Ethereum's compatibility with other blockchains through its use of smart contract programming languages like Vyper allows for the construction of decentralized applications (including games) that can interact with multiple blockchain networks. \n\nSome examples of popular games built on Ethereum blockchain include:  \n1) **Axie Infinity**\\- a popular game that allows players to collect, breed, and battle fantasy creatures called Axies.  \n2) **Gods Unchained**\\-  a digital trading card game that allows players to collect and battle with unique cards.  \n3) **Vulcan Verse**\\- an open world blockchain game built by Vulcan Forged where you can travel around and interact with games and events.   \n4) **The Sandbox**\\- a virtual world that allows players to buy and sell virtual land and assets.\n\nOverall, in addition to the above-mentioned features, its decentralization, transparency and security make it an idea platform for building games involving digital assets and its benefits are clear. \n\nWhat are you thoughts about this?","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678526270.0},{"title":"The next step to true interoperability","author":"SamoyedCoin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/11p60h9\/the_next_step_to_true_interoperability\/","text":"There\u2019s wormholes.

I'm fairly new, so please understand,if my question is already resolved\/easy to answer.\n\nWalletConnect is the most widely used standard for dapps and wallets to be agnostic to the concrete counterparty they are connecting to. I was asking myself, how resillient this setup is.\n\nFor instance, if a dapp's UI is hosted on ipfs and it connects via metamask, then that connection is directly via the browser and local (afaik), and it cannot be intercepted (assuming browser not hacked etc.).\n\nHowever, with WalletConnect there are relays running on wallet-connects servers which make this concrete connection between the dapp and the wallet. This is a centralised security\/censorship issue. [As far as I can see, it's not possible to host these relays yourself at the moment.](https:\/\/docs.walletconnect.com\/2.0\/advanced\/faq). \n\nI also don't know the specifics of WalletConnect relays. What is the worst thing that can happen, if they become compromised? Can compromised servers deny people using a dapp? Can compromised servers make nasty things via mitm attacks?\n\nI am aware, that the direct interaction with the smart contract can happen without the UI. But I don't think that the majority of users in crypto can actually do that when in emergency.\n\nGiven the value of decentralisation and Trustlessness, I am not sure, whether the widespread of WalletConnect relays is really all that ok. After all, if a powerful actor wants, they might approach the WalletConnect and force them to change their servers to do a specific thing.\n\nIt would be great, if this couldn't be used for censorship just like the tornado cash was blacklisted.\n\nWhat do you think?

We've recently launched our website and our first game is now available to play!\n\nOur goal is to create a platform where multiple games can be played, and users on the platform can earn governance tokens for engaging. With these tokens, users can create proposals or vote on created proposals to steer the direction of the platform. This includes gameplay balancing, development of new games, steering of the community treasury, and layer 2 solutions.\n\nOur first game revolves around the care and growth of \"Charlys,\" which are dynamic NFTs used as the basis for characters. Players can clean, feed, and play a mini-game in Unity with their minted characters, and with enough care, players can evolve their characters, enhancing their attributes and changing their visual appearance. We're currently working on a battle game where users can compete with their evolved characters against each other and AI.\n\nTo kickstart our decentralization process, we'll be launching an Airdrop Campaign soon. We believe the only way to achieve true decentralization is to distribute tokens fairly and get as many people as possible to participate. We have a plan for this that we'll be sharing in the coming days.\n\nI'd love to hear your constructive criticism or answer any questions you may have.

This is by no means an exhaustive list, I decided to limit myself to 10 people, somewhat arbitrarily, to ensure this post didn't take too long to pull together. I would love it if you, reading this can use this thread to add other women who I've missed that deserve some recognition. Anyway, my 10 picks - in the order I happened to think of them:\n\n------\n\n**Pooja Ranjan**\n\nIf you want to know what is currently going on in Ethereum development then Pooja should probably be your first source. If you only follow her sites listed below you will understand more than 99% of crypto users. Do be aware it isn't aimed at complete newbies, it's for people who already have a bit of familiarity with the chain and want to stay as up to date as possible without needing to spend 25 hours a day following the progress of different teams, EIPs, discussions etc. If you know a little about Ethereum already and want to have the best 'alpha' on what is coming, without any shilling\/hype etc, there is probably no better follow.\n\n Ethereum Cat Herders \n\n * Ethereum Cat Herders: https:\/\/www.ethereumcatherders.com\/\n\n * https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@ethcatherders\/playlists\n\n * Etherworld: https:\/\/www.etherworld.co\/\n\n\n------\n\n**Mary Maller**\n\nDr Maller is a ZK researcher at the Ethereum Foundation; and not 'researcher' as in *\"I did my own research by watching someone shill their shitcoin on Youtube\"*, but 'researcher' as in *\"constantly publishing in academic journals on cutting edge cryptographic topics\"*. We are already starting to see the early excitement build up around ZKEVMs and other zero knowledge projects, the odds are that any you happen upon will be built on top of mathematics that Mary has contributed to.\n\n * https:\/\/scholar.google.com\/citations?user=gzHDMSYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao\n\n * Scalability Solutions from zk SNARKs: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h4UfD4Mp6EM\n\n * The Roaring Twenties: Recent Advances in Zero-Knowledge Proofs: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uZAOt6_fZ1k\n\n------\n\n**Anett Rolikova**\n\nSelf-described 'Ethereum Sunshine', Anett has contributed to a bunch of projects, probably the most useful to me personally being her 'curated crypto list', which serves as an unbeatable starting place for anyone getting started in their Ethereum journey. Someone linked me to this list about 4 years ago and it was fundamental in making the task of getting to grips with Ethereum manageable. If you're feeling overwhelmed at the challenge of comprehending what this whole space is about: you want to learn more but don't know where to start then the answer is here:\n \n * https:\/\/github.com\/anettrolikova\/Crypto\n\nShe has also been an events organizer for the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians, written the NFT Standards Documentation and made a bunch of other contributions.\n\n * https:\/\/medium.com\/ethereum-magicians\/ethereum-l2-future-by-ethereum-magicians-cd62cefa0fe7\n\n * https:\/\/www.nftstandards.wtf\/NFT+Standards+Wiki+-+READ.me\n\n * Why ERC721 sucks and we need a new NFT standard [ETHCC 5]: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IPk46oT1nt8\n\n------\n\n**Camila Russo**\n\nIf you haven't heard of Cami Russo yet, then it is very likely that you will in the next year or so. She has written a book on the early days of Ethereum called *'The Infinite Machine'* which is currently being made into a movie by Ridley Scott's studio... yea that Ridley Scott studios, who also produced Alien, Gladiator, Bladerunner and some of the other most popular movies of all time! The story is pretty fascinating, and when the movie comes out it should take Ethereum another big step towards wider recognition in the general public.\n\n * https:\/\/thedefiant.io\/scott-free-infinite-machine\n\nShe also founded and runs one of the most trustworthy crypto news sources - The Defiant. It focuses on DeFi, with plenty of developer interviews, use and presentation of on-chain data, etc etc:\n\n * https:\/\/thedefiant.substack.com\/p\/the-defiants-definitive-guide-to\n\n------\n\n**Anna Rose**\n\nAnna Rose is one of the main links between the highly academic world of Zero Knowledge research and the average, less technically specialized user. She is basically involved in Zero Knowledge everything...\n\n * Podcast: https:\/\/zeroknowledge.fm\/episodes\/\n\n * Conferences: https:\/\/www.zksummit.com\/\n\n * Jobs board: https:\/\/jobsboard.zeroknowledge.fm\/\n\nIf you are interested in this 'ZK' stuff that you have heard will be the next big thing, but don't have a PhD in Cryptography then you are potentially easy prey for the shills of countless projects, who will use buzzwords and bullshit to convince you to buy into things you don't fully understand. Anna's content will give you the knowledge to know your SNARKs from your STARKs, and your PLONK from your Plonky2, so you can have a better chance of picking the really promising projects from those that just have a big marketing budget or desperate bagholders.\n\n * Zero Knowledge: Privacy and Transparency's Beautiful Co-existence [DevCon 5]: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6wMoV8G2118\n\n------\n\n**Frederika Ernst**\n\nDr Ernst is a host of Epicentre, one of the most well researched and non-shilly crypto podcasts. Their guests are industry leading builders and thinkers, but the hosts always push back on any unsubstantiated claims and demand further explanation of anything that sounds unlikely or overly optimistic. They have always done their research and the questions asked demonstrate a level of understanding that makes it almost impossible for the listener to come away without learning from every episode. You should be a listener if you want a general crypto podcast that never seems like the guests are just being allowed to hype up their projects.\n\n * https:\/\/epicenter.tv\/hosts\/friederike-ernst\/\n\nShe is also the COO of Gnosis, the scaling solution formerly known as xDAI, that POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) run on. POAPs are collectable badges that have become an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem, if you watch a big event live (like The Merge) then you can usually get a POAP, if you participate in a DAO governance call then you can usually get a POAP, if you go to an Ethereum conference then you will probably end up with a walletful of POAPs! Gnosis is also home to plenty of other dApps, a nicely decentralized staking community and all the usual sort of things a sidechain would want.\n\n * Gnosis Chain: Extending Ethereum [ETHCC 5]: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LYVOE3P08eU\n\n------\n\n**Jinglan Wang**\n\nJinglan is a Co-Founder and the Chief Executive Officer of Optimism, currently the second biggest Ethereum L2, recently in the news for a partnership with Coinbase over the Optimism Stack, and pioneers in retroactive public goods funding, DAO governance, and a series of massive airdrops to L2 users\/Gitcoin donors\/DAO participants etc. Disclaimer, I'm a delegate to Optimism and a Citizen's House badgeholder, so I won't go on about how great the project is as I'm definitely a biased source.\n\n * https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O8ycNV0lF5M\n\nShe is also a founder and advisor to the Blockchain Education Network, one of the biggest outreach programs in crypto, helping schools, clubs etc around the world teach people about this new technology.\n\n * https:\/\/www.blockchainedu.org\/\n\n------\n\n**Taylor Monahan**\n\nIf you were around in Ethereum before 'The DAO' or joined any time up to the first ICO mania then you are pretty likely to remember Taylor, even if you didn't know here name. She was one of the founders of the first easy to use Ethereum wallet (My Ether Wallet), before which we had to wait to sync the chain before making transactions (was that Parity, Myst, ?, I don't remember). This was an absolute game changer and allowed many more people to start accessing Ethereum... just in time for them to faced with a barrage of new 'Initial Coin Offerings', investments with varying degrees of legitimacy. As well as being partially responsible for enabling the chaos that ensued, Taylor also took it upon herself to try and call out scams and terrible investment 'opportunities' that newbies were falling for. If you look her up on Twitter you'll see that she still is still doing this, though now working for the ecosystem's current main wallet Metamask.\n\n * How to Avoid Crypto Scams: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EiYYQCs49VM\n\n * The Original Sin [DevCon 6]: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7OnxjlA-RKA\n\n------\n\n**Pulja Ohlhaver**\n\nPulja has become well more know in the Ethereum community following the publication of the paper 'Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul', of which she is a co-author. This was what sparked the conversations around soul-bound tokens and their uses in the middle of last year, it also talks about the state and future of many aspects of the space that are key to governance, such as Sybil resistance, quadratic funding and social recovery wallets, all of which are becoming increasingly important in DAOs and Web 3.0 in general.\n\n * https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763\n\nShe is a big picture \/ long game thinker for what the crypto ecosystem could become, if we can navigate our way there without falling into corporate\/governmental control on one side of the ridge or fraudsters and scams on the other. If you haven't read the paper yet then I highly recommend it, or at the very least listen to her explain it.\n\n * Bottom up Building: Pathways towards a Decentralized Society [DevCon 6]: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-JpBmA-8FVc\n\nLike everyone else on this list, Pulja has a variety of other contributions, such as being the Strategy Counsel at FlashBots (the MEV research and development organization).\n\n * https:\/\/www.flashbots.net\/\n\n------\n \n**Simona Pop**\n\nSimona is a DAO governance and public good thought-leader and advocate; a key contributor to Gitcoin (the biggest public goods funding platform in the ecosystem) and the organizer of Schelling Point (probably the biggest 'regen' conference). She was also a co-founder of 'Bounties Network', a platform similar(ish) to 'Fiver' for Web3.0 where freelancers can be paid for doing everything from finding a bug in some code, translating documentation t another language or even planting a tree... she's one of the many people in Ethereum community working hard to realize a vision of a better future, by building it.\n\n * https:\/\/gov.gitcoin.co\/u\/pop\/activity\/topics\n \n * https:\/\/schellingpoint.gitcoin.co\/info\n \n * DAOs and Biomimicry [DevCon 6]: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=V0I5dkkpJ9o\n\n------\n\nSo over to you I guess, who have I missed?","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1678270394.0},{"title":"What is the benefit of Minting Gitcoin's Quadratic Funding Open edition?","author":"UnusualHoliday8499","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/369bkwxh0mma1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678304350.0},{"title":"How was ETHDenver?","author":"not_qz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/11kv58a\/how_was_ethdenver\/","text":"[ETHDenver](https:\/\/www.ethdenver.com) was held from 24 Feb to 7 March and was a massive event. \nFor those that attended, how was it for you?\nIf this was your first Eth event, would you go to another one next time?\n\nIt was my second time attending this year and I\u2019m curious how others experienced it!","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678183378.0},{"title":"What is Ethereum?

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThe best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit \/r\/ethstaker for more details\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added?

To keep this validator set healthy, it should be protected from any drastic changes in number for security. If the number of validators could increase or decrease very quickly, this could be employed as a tactic in orchestrating an attack. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8td8awbkrjla1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1b4adf7facc14aa97c8db216953459814fd2e8f\n\nA party could potentially exit a large number of validators, immediately causing a scare and others to exit, then instantly activate twice the amount of validators and gain significant control over the network. If there were no buffers to exit and entry, this could be a serious vulnerability to Ethereum. Beyond the queues, there are additional penalties to those that perform a malicious action (like proposing two different blocks at once) and are slashed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Unstaking on Ethereum\n\nThe Shanghai hard fork introduces withdrawals for which information is written into a new space on Ethereum blocks, without the need to pay for gas. There are two queues withdrawers must go through to withdraw their ETH. The first is the exit queue and is somewhat slow, the other is the withdrawal queue and is much faster.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bxr5idw2sjla1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4624231b38e2d29bd543abe7b32815ccbaffa6d4\n\nThe slower exit queue is only necessary to enter if a validator is trying to withdraw all of their staked ETH (the principal + rewards), in which case it\u2019s called a full withdrawal. The exit queue allows 7-8 full withdrawals to happen every 32 blocks. The number of withdrawals permitted in such a period is called the \u201cchurn limit,\u201d and increases as more validators become active. Once a validator intending a full withdrawal goes through this exit queue, they\u2019ll arrive in the withdrawal queue. It would take 100,000 validators (approximately 1\/5th of the current set) 63 days to go through the exit queue.\n\nThe faster withdrawal queue processes a maximum of 16 full or partial withdrawals every block (or every 12 seconds). A partial withdrawal happens automatically and disburses rewards earned by validators to addresses they designate to receive those rewards. Both of these are viewed as being equal in the withdrawal queue. It would take 100,000 validators 20 hours to go through the withdrawal queue.\n\nThere is a prerequisite to entering either of the queues above: validators must ensure that withdrawal addresses are updated and refer to valid addresses on Ethereum (technically, in the 0x01 format). This can be done now, and doing so will place rewards for those validators in the withdawal queue automatically once Shanghai goes live.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Impacts of Unstaking\n\nWhile likely that many will want to unstake their ETH initially, the capacity for validators to withdraw is throttled. The reason is so that the validator set doesn\u2019t change too drastically in too short a time. For the same reason, a queue exists to begin staking ETH. This also impacts the price of ETH, which won\u2019t see the supply dump many prophesize.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7bis8l4trjla1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bfa6319f9584eef98ba10a014ae0f18ef987ebb7\n\nIt is likely that even amongst those who unstake, a significant portion will start staking again shortly thereafter. This is because many will be shifting from one staking service to another, something they can\u2019t do until they unstake first. A further incentive is in the rewards rate, which increases as the validator set gets smaller.\n\nFinally, the automatic disbursement of rewards will be exciting to look forward to. It introduces new liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem directly, as opposed to having it locked up with the ETH that\u2019s being staked. Ever since the Merge happened, validators have not received their rewards for validating the blockchain, the rewards are locked with the staked ETH. The additional \\~0.2 ETH per block added directly into the ecosystem should have some interesting effects.\n\n# In Conclusion\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating that staking withdrawals are right around the corner. The conversation around whether to include withdrawals in the Shanghai hard fork was a big reason this newsletter started. It seemed necessary that as many of us in Ethereum as possible be knowledgeable about upcoming upgrades so that we can lend our support to the ones we consider most important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2asqa9xlrjla1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=abd7fa1e14d1b6b4d16eea2527263fe5424fc2bd\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a summary of the full write-up available on my free newsletter! \n\nSign up for a simple explanation of a blockchain concept, delivered once a week.\n\nStay kind.

The company does not send the items, the user can request the 80$ back through the smart contract;\n2. The company sends the items, the user confirms the items when he receives them, all is well;\n3. The company sends the items, they are defective, the user does not confirm the items and requests the 80$ back through the smart contract;\n4. The user does not pay 90$ but only 80$ (doesn't use MetaMask, manually buy the items); the order would be registered in the smart contract, but the company sees that the user has not paid the correct amount for the shipping costs and decides to not send the item (obviously it would also notify the user for that). The user can still request its 80$ back through the smart contract.\n\nSo worst case scenario the user would lose the shipping costs, granted I don\u2019t add another mechanic so that the user can ask a refund on that cost as well, and then the company will then have the right to accept such refund case by case.\n\nIt seems to me this approach kinda tries to minimize the risks for both actors, but I want to know your opinion on it. Perhaps there is a much better approach that slipped my mind.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1677577716.0},{"title":"Why do zkRollups use proofs with zero knowledge property?","author":"juggle_the_jungle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/11e1kba\/why_do_zkrollups_use_proofs_with_zero_knowledge\/","text":"Reading into zkRollups, I've found that [validity proofs](https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/developers\/docs\/scaling\/zk-rollups\/#validity-proofs) are generated using either zkSNARKs or zkSTARKs.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThe best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit \/r\/ethstaker for more details\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added?

I have done a lot of reading but still find myself scratching my head around the intricacies of censorship as it pertains MEV.\n\nMy understanding is that ever since the merge, when Ethereum went from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, the process in which blocks are built have created a vector for censorship. MEV or Maxium Extractible Value is a sort of strategy where the block builders (miners or validators) can rearrange, include, or exclude transactions to maximize their profits. \"**MEV Boost\"** acts as a mediator that can be used to give the validators a fair share of the MEV extracted.\n\nThe problem is that MEV Boost is also complying with OFAC sanctions and has a blacklist of ethereum addresses that have been sanctioned by OFAC. Validators who run MEV Boost are effectively excluding any OFAC sanctioned Ethereum addresses from being added to a new block, which is censoring those addresses from interacting with the ethereum protocol.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Is my understanding above correct?\n2. Why did this become an issue post merge, how come Proof of Work did not have the same issues of censorship?\n3. Are those OFAC sanctioned Ethereum addresses completely blocked from transacting or are they just being ignored by the validators that are running MEV boost but they can still get included in Blocks from validators that are not complying with OFAC sanctions?\n4. On the [mevwatch.info](https:\/\/mevwatch.info\/) website it has a \"censorship offenders leaderboard\" which lists the validators that are censoring transactions. I noticed the biggest offenders are the largest validators like LIDO, Coinbase, Binance. I am assuming they are required to block these transactions, however it appears that only some of their validators are censoring transactions. For example: for Coinbase it shows that they have roughly 800 validators, however only 472 are censored which is 58% of their validators. Whats the deal with this? How come they are running some censored and some uncensored validators?\n\nAny insight or even a better explanation would greatly be appreciated.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1677454300.0},{"title":"50% of All DeFi Developers Build on Ethereum, Still the Entry Point for Many","author":"velo999","url":"https:\/\/somereverie.substack.com\/p\/only-50-of-defi-developers-build","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677409549.0},{"title":"Implications of crackdown on staking in the US?","author":"neocybersonic","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/11coh1p\/implications_of_crackdown_on_staking_in_the_us\/","text":"I'm sitting here thinking about the crackdown on staking in the US...

New Jersey is considering a bill that could make it illegal to sell NFTs without a license. The Digital Asset and Blockchain Technology Act proposes to prohibit engaging in digital asset business activities without being licensed by the department. This means that artists who simply want to sell a piece of art as an NFT will need a license.\n\nWhile this legislation might seem like it only affects residents of New Jersey, it could have wider implications. Selling NFTs has become increasingly popular, with many artists and creators using them as a way to monetize their work. If this bill passes, it could set a precedent for other states or even countries to introduce similar legislation.\n\nThe bill not only requires a license for holding, storing, or maintaining custody of a digital asset on behalf of others but also for issuing a digital asset, such as creating a smart contract that sells an NFT. This means that anyone who wants to sell NFTs, even as a hobby or a one-time thing, would need to go through the licensing process.\n\nThe repercussions of this legislation are far-reaching. Not only would it be impractical and unreasonable for artists to have to go to a dingy office in North Jersey to fill out paperwork and receive a certificate just to sell an NFT, but violators would also face a hefty fee.\n\nThe proposed legislation has sparked controversy and criticism, with many people expressing concerns about the impact it could have on the NFT market. It also brings up questions about how much regulation is necessary in the world of digital assets and whether this bill is a step too far.\n\nIn the words of Twitter user Degen Doobz, \"remember the saying, 'first they came for the New Jersey Pepe derivative NFTs, and I did not speak out because I was not from NJ. Then they came for my Pepe derivative NFTs, and there was no one left to speak for me.' This legislation will have repercussions for everyone.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this bill will pass and what the future holds for the NFT market. However, it is clear that the digital world is evolving rapidly, and it is up to lawmakers to find a balance between regulation and innovation.\n\nIf you wanna learn more I post a free weekly newsletter here: [https:\/\/poetryofprogress.substack.com\/](https:\/\/poetryofprogress.substack.com\/)","upvote_ratio":0.39,"created_utc":1677473024.0},{"title":"What's the best way(s) to send private crypto transaction on Ethereum mainnet (Tornado cash alternatives for 2023)?","author":"Guyserbun007","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/11d2fcx\/whats_the_best_ways_to_send_private_crypto\/","text":"What are some dApps I can use to do private transactions on Eth mainnet?","upvote_ratio":0.51,"created_utc":1677471371.0},{"title":"Which Defi narratives will dominate 2023 and 2024?","author":"gaurangtorvekar","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/11bgp2v\/which_defi_narratives_will_dominate_2023_and_2024\/","text":"Apart from the obvious ones like Dexes, Lending protocols, Yield protocols and Cross-chain bridges, which other innovative protocols and ideas would dominate the next bull run?\n\nI am noticing a few projects being launched as \"money market protocols\" and yet others like Timeswap which are promising \"non-liquidatable\" loans.

This can be done in the event of a hack, which is easily solved by changing an account\u2019s signer.\n\n# Multicall Transactions\n\nSince all accounts (i.e. our wallets) can have custom code, that can be used to bundle transactions together, just like the way smart contracts do. This means a token swap or NFT purchase takes 1 operation, instead of up to 4. This eliminates the need for infinite approvals, as everything necessary happens in one transaction, while also reducing gas costs for users.\n\n# Session Keys\n\nThanks to custom code, wallets can authorize platforms to perform specific functions for a set amount of time. This can make using exchanges or playing blockchain based games won\u2019t require authorization every time a repeated task is performed. It\u2019s instead authorized for some time to do those things by the session key.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wi2pqxcvm6ka1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4c02d441787985998662e9f2802c3dcb829b258f\n\n# Social Recovery\n\nWith social recovery, anyone can appoint a number of \u201cguardian\u201d accounts. If a signer for a wallet is ever compromised, the guardians could vote to change the signer for that account themselves. Guardians can be added or removed by the signer themselves, but with a time delay. This presents an opportunity to recover a wallet from a compromise by depending on others you trust.\n\n# MFA\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication becomes possible, with an operation requiring approvals from several accounts before actually happening. While this is similar to milt-signature wallets, it is different. Multi-signature wallets are actually smart contracts that perform operations when several people authorize them. Account Abstraction on the other hand grants that ability directly to all wallets.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ifou29p7l6ka1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=291b542df7939e99c7930de7a5ced70470b28bb2\n\n# Key Rotator\n\nThis presents the possibility of buying and selling accounts, since signers for those accounts can be changed. This could allow for the safe transfer of wallets with whitelists for upcoming NFT mints or even soulbound tokens, making them not so soulbound anymore.\n\n# Code Custom Logic\n\nWallets can have custom code which can be used to enhance or alter the functoins they perform. This custom code could be built by anyone and made available to the public as plugins. Imagine an App Store that added additional functionality to your wallet. That becomes possible.\n\n# Signers for Different Operations\n\nWallets can have instances that are specific to the device they\u2019re on, only authorized to perform specific transactions. This could allow anyone to have a wallet on their phone that can only perform very basic operations, have spend limits, and cannot perform a transfer. An instance of a wallet on a home computer could be given broader access.\n\n# Gas in Other Currencies\n\nWith wallets having custom code, any currency can be used to pay for gas fees. Someone could pay for gas with USDC, for example. What actually happens is that the currency is swapped into ETH and used to pay for gas fees, all in the same transaction.\n\n# Spam Filter\n\nA spam filter also becomes a possibility, wherein anyone can permit inbound transfers to their wallet only from authorized sources. There will likely be services that compile safe senders, allowing anyone to import a list into their wallet of addresses that can make transfers to them.

However, the network has been facing some challenges in terms of scalability and transaction fees. In response, the Ethereum community has been exploring different solutions to address these issues, and one of them is the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). \n\nIn this thread, we'll take a closer look at how zkEVM interacts with Ethereum Layer 1.\n\nFirstly, it's important to understand what zkEVM is. It's a layer 2 solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions off-chain, which helps to reduce gas costs and increase transaction throughput. In other words, zkEVM allows for more transactions to be processed without congesting the Ethereum network. However, it's not a standalone solution and needs to interact with the Ethereum Layer 1.\n\nThe interaction between zkEVM and Ethereum Layer 1 happens through smart contracts. When a user wants to use zkEVM, they first need to create a smart contract on the Ethereum network. This contract is called a \"zkSync contract,\" and it's used to lock up ETH or ERC-20 tokens. Once the tokens are locked, the user can interact with zkEVM to execute transactions off-chain.\n\nWhen a transaction is executed on zkEVM, it's verified through zero-knowledge proofs, which are then submitted to the zkSync contract on the Ethereum Layer 1. The zkSync contract then updates the user's balance on Ethereum Layer 1, reflecting the transaction that was executed off-chain. This means that the transaction is validated on Ethereum Layer 1, even though it was executed off-chain through zkEVM.\n\nIn summary, zkEVM interacts with Ethereum Layer 1 through smart contracts. It allows for more transactions to be processed off-chain, which helps to reduce gas costs and increase transaction throughput. However, the transactions are still validated on Ethereum Layer 1 through a zkSync contract, ensuring their security and validity. As the Ethereum community continues to explore different solutions to address scalability and transaction fees, zkEVM is emerging as a promising solution that could help to address these challenges.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1677239516.0},{"title":"Ethereum custodian Fireblocks implicated in disappearance of FTX user funds","author":"edenkins","url":"https:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/cryptocurrency-news\/what-crypto-investors-should-know-about-unregulated-custodians-3004318","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677184200.0},{"title":"Coinbase launches Base | Optimistic rollups vs ZK rollups","author":"gaurangtorvekar","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/11amp7o\/coinbase_launches_base_optimistic_rollups_vs_zk\/","text":"Nowadays, every week, we get a new announcement about an L2 rollup being launched!\n\nWith Coinbase building on top of the OP stack, what are your thoughts about how the narrative between Optimistic rollups and ZK rollups will be played out in the next few years?\n\nThis also raises many questions such as -\n\n* Which chains will become more dominant?\n* Will each new L2 have its own niche\/use case?\n* Will there be a time when there are just too many L2s?

Here are some other actions the IRS can take before resorting to jail time.\n\n1. Did you know that many exchanges already report to the IRS? When they send out 1099 forms, the IRS also gets a copy. If you decide not to report your crypto activity, you\u2019ll be first in line for a crypto tax audit!\n2. The IRS can assess a 20% accuracy-related penalty on understated tax. For example, if you didn\u2019t report your crypto and you owed $5,000 in taxes, the accuracy-related penalty would be $1,000. This penalty can be assessed for negligence or disregard for the rules.\n3. If the IRS does audit you and find you guilty of tax fraud, they can assess a 75% fraud penalty of the unpaid tax. This can even be done without opening a criminal investigation.\n4. What\u2019s the worst case scenario? Prison! Any attempt to cheat the IRS can be considered tax evasion or tax fraud. Both of these are felonies and can have a maximum penalty of $100,000 and 5 years in prison per each tax year.\n\nBottom line is to always report your crypto! Not reporting just isn't worth it.\n\n*Disclaimer: The information provided pertains to the United States.

It essentially serves as collateral; if a validator makes a mistake, such as proposing two blocks at once, they will lose some of the currency at stake (or be slashed, in other words).\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) make staked funds liquid and usable for other purposes. This is accomplished by issuing tokens that represent the ETH staked. When a user stakes ETH with an LSD provider, they will receive (ERC-20) tokens that allow them to redeem their deposit.  \n\n\nBefore Ethereum, LSDs existed on other chains, such as Kusama\/Polkadot, where unstacking can take up to 28 days. The popularity of LSD on Ethereum stems from the fact that it was previously unknown when withdrawals\/unstacking would be possible. Ethereum withdrawals have now been confirmed as part of the Shanghai upgrade in March and will be covered in greater detail in a future write-up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How Do LSDs Work?**\n\nThe cToken model is used by the majority of LSDs. When you stake 1 ETH, you will receive 1 tokenETH, a token representing your deposit. The ETH deposited is pooled and grows as it accumulates rewards. You can get your deposit and share of the rewards back by exchanging tokenETH for ETH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no 1:1 ratio between the token and the staked asset in LSD systems. There will always be fewer tokenETH than there are ETH. As the amount of ETH staked grows with rewards, so does the amount that can be redeemed with tokenETH. This is why LSD token prices aren\u2019t always the same as ETH prices at any given time.  \n\n\nStaking on ETH and receiving rewards on that staked ETH on a regular basis is an alternative to LSD. This can be accomplished by directly staking 32 ETH or by participating in programs that offer to stake but do not provide a token in exchange. The rewards are paid out in ETH based on the performance of the validator.\n\nStaking with Coinbase, for example, provides a user with a 3% yield in ETH. Alternatively, you can participate in the LSD and receive cbETH tokens after you stake with Coinbase. When you do this, you will no longer directly accumulate ETH rewards; instead, you will exchange the cbETH for ETH in exchange for a share of the pool\u2019s rewards.\n\n## Providers of LSD\n\nThere are various LSD providers, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. There are up to 20 staking services to choose from, with up to 7 offering an LSD, according to Beaconchain. From most centralized to least centralized, here are the major LSD providers and a brief explanation of each.\n\n## Exchanges that are centralised\n\nThere are centralized exchanges that provide LSDs; these are the simplest but also the most expensive solutions. Fees on centralized exchanges can reach up to 30% \u2014 that is, 30% of rewards go to Coinbase before the rest is distributed to stakes.\n\nWhen staking with a centralized exchange, the nodes are entirely run by their employees. The cToken model is used by exchanges such as Coinbase. To exchange the LSD ETH for regular ETH, centralized exchanges required identity verification or KYC.\n\n## LIDO\n\nLIDO is one of the first Ethereum LSD providers. They allow anyone to stake any amount of ETH in exchange for stETH. The LIDO DAO appoints potential validators and distributes ETH to them. LIDO takes 10% of rewards, with half going to validators and the other half going to a DAO treasury to be used as needed.\n\nThe cToken model described above is not used by LIDO. Instead, the DAO chooses oracles to aggregate the balances of all validators using LIDO ETH. The supply of stETH is then adjusted based on whether there is a net increase or decrease. If a day ends with more rewards, stETH is distributed. Otherwise, some stETH is burned. The supply of stETH is adjusted in this manner on a daily basis.\n\n## Pool of Rockets\n\nStakers and node operators are two types of independent participants in Rocket Pool. Stakers can deposit any amount they want, while node operators must have at least 16 ETH. Stakers contribute 16 ETH to node operators, which is used to set up a validator node. Node operators receive 15% of the rewards generated for ETH staked on others\u2019 behalf.\n\nOnly stakers, not node operators, receive the rETH LSD in Rocket Pool. This means that node operators get paid directly, whereas stakers get paid the LSD way: by exchanging rETH for ETH. The cToken model is used by Rocket Pool\u2019s LSD.\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s upcoming \u201cAtlas\u201d upgrade will allow node operators to participate by depositing 8 ETH rather than the current 16.\n\nFinally, LSDs allows you to be in two places at the same time. Staking ETH can generate yield, and a token equivalent can be used in DeFi to generate additional yield. LSDs\u2019 flexibility makes them an appealing option for many new stakeholders. They come at the expense of some lost reward fees, but the benefit is the flexibility and the elimination of the need to set up a validator node at home.  \n\n\n It is my hope that LSD providers will make staking more accessible in the future, and that more people will be able (and willing) to set up their own nodes. There is a serious risk of centralized LSD providers staking too much ETH, but they allow many newcomers to participate in staking.   \n\n\n \n\n[Follow us for more information and insights](https:\/\/medium.com\/@heyabdullah\/lsds-a-simple-explanation-of-how-liquid-staking-providers-work-44f53ac559fe)","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677100956.0},{"title":"Question about using Flashbots with Metamask.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThe best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit \/r\/ethstaker for more details\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added?

The market is saturated with all sorts of P2E games, a lot of which may not ultimately prove to be worth one's time and effort. However, after searching the market for a good bit, heres a quick look at my top 10 p2e blockchain games that seem to be worthwhile. \n\n1) **Illuvium (ILV)** is a sci-fi adventure NFT creature collector and autobattler game that enables players to explore 7 alien landscapes. Players uncover the events that shattered Illuvium and can hunt and capture over 100 deadly beasts that rule the alien territory.\n\n2) **Alien Worlds (TLM)** is one of the best P2E games, attracting more than 3.6 million users since inception and more than 700,000 monthly players. It\u2019s another sci-fi game that enables players to explore space and scrub various planets for resources.\n\n3) **The Sandbox (SAND)** is of the top P2E games that enable players to choose from more than 140,000 avatars is The Sandbox. Players use their avatars to play in the Sandbox and to build, own and monetize their piece of LAND. \n\n4) **Axie Infinity (AXS)** many gamers consider Axie Infinity as the pioneering platform of play to earn blockchain games. This NFT game enables players to collect and mint NFTs, which represent digital pets known as Axies.\n\n5) **Vulcan Verse (PYR)**  is a decentralized open world blockchain game where you can travel around and interact with games and events. Vulcan Forged, one of the leading platforms in this space is the blockchain gaming studio that has developed this game. The MMORPG game is built using blockchain technology and consists of land parcels represented by NFTs.\n\n6) **Decentraland (MANA)** is the first virtual world owned by its users, enabling them to create, explore and buy LAND, a plot in the Metaverse. Players can explore LANDs to experience majestic scenery such as medieval dungeon mazes and villages. \n\n7) **Battle Infinity (IBAT)** proved since its presale that it would be one of the best P2E games to watch this year. The key attraction of Battle Infinity is earning rewards on 6 platforms. Players can enter the IBAT Premier League and build up teams to compete for rewards. Another way to earn is by monetizing land. \n\n8) **RobotEra (TARO)** is a promising new play-to-earn crypto game that puts earning opportunities directly in the hands of the people. Players can explore a vast virtual land, acquiring resources and turning a profit along the way.\n\n9) **Lucky Block (LBLOCK)** is a popular cryptocurrency ecosystem that has just launched a new casino and sportsbook offering more than 2,700 games, sports betting, enticing bonuses and no fees.\n\n10) **Tamadoge (TAMA)** this is a promising P2E game since its early in its roadmap with high potential in the long term. Its native token TAMA is also a meme coin that separates itself from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu by having a real world utility. Players can earn TAMA tokens by exercising, feeding and nurturing their pets.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

In other words, SMT solvers determine whether a given logical formula can be true or false based on a set of logical and mathematical rules.\n\nSMT solvers are used in various applications such as software verification, formal verification of hardware designs, optimization, and automated theorem proving. They are highly effective in solving complex logical problems, as they can make use of efficient algorithms, heuristics, and decision procedures to explore the space of possible solutions.\n\nRead more -> [SMTChecker and SMT Solvers: Exploring Formal Verification One Step at a Time](https:\/\/www.truscova.com\/blog_article_7.php)","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1676315189.0},{"title":"Embracing L2 Networks: A Future Where Ethereum's L1 is Reserved for Enterprises and L2s Interact Exclusively with Each Other","author":"nebotov","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/111veqh\/embracing_l2_networks_a_future_where_ethereums_l1\/","text":"Ethereum has been making waves in the crypto industry for its innovative technology and its potential to transform the financial sector. However, as the network grows, it is becoming increasingly clear that the existing infrastructure may not be able to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for transactions.\n\nLayer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks are two different types of Ethereum networks that offer different features and capabilities. L1 is the main Ethereum blockchain, which is used for executing smart contracts and processing transactions. It is the backbone of the entire Ethereum ecosystem and is responsible for securing the network.\n\nOn the other hand, L2 networks are built on top of L1 and are designed to improve the scalability and speed of transactions. They are often referred to as \"off-chain\" solutions because they allow transactions to be processed outside of the main blockchain. L2 networks offer faster transaction processing times, lower fees, and greater scalability than L1, making them an attractive option for users who want to save time and money.\n\nAs the Ethereum network continues to grow, many users are starting to shift towards L2 solutions to overcome the limitations of the L1 network. With the current congestion and high fees on the L1 network, many users are finding it challenging to use the network for small transactions, which has led to a growing interest in L2 networks.\n\nThe idea of having L1 networks reserved for large businesses and institutions while L2 networks interact exclusively with each other has been gaining traction among the Ethereum community. This approach could help to reduce the strain on the L1 network and improve the scalability of the overall network. Additionally, it could lead to increased adoption of L2 solutions, as users become more comfortable with off-chain transactions.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of using L2 networks is that they allow for instant transactions at a significantly lower cost than L1. This makes them an attractive option for users who need to make small transactions frequently. However, the current challenge is that L2 networks are still in their early stages, and not all applications are compatible with them.\n\nThere are several types of L2 solutions, including state channels, plasma, and sidechains. Each of these solutions has its unique features, and some are better suited for specific use cases than others. For example, state channels are ideal for games and micropayments, while plasma is better suited for more complex transactions that require more processing power.\n\nDespite the advantages of L2 networks, there are some challenges that must be addressed before they can become a viable alternative to L1. One of the most significant challenges is interoperability between different L2 solutions. Currently, there is no standardization for L2 networks, which can make it challenging for them to work together seamlessly.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of reserving L1 networks for large businesses and institutions while L2 networks interact exclusively with each other is an intriguing concept that could help to reduce the strain on the L1 network and improve the scalability of the overall network. However, this will require a significant amount of collaboration and innovation within the Ethereum community to develop new standards and protocols for L2 networks. With the current pace of development and the increasing interest in L2 solutions, it is likely that we will see significant progress in this area over the next few years.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1676354466.0},{"title":"The Evolution of NFT token standards: from ERC-721 to ERC-5023","author":"avataragain","url":"https:\/\/roverx.io\/blog\/evolution-of-ethereum-nft-token-standards-721-5023\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1676294186.0},{"title":"Vitalik sends funds to Turkey Earthquake relief fund \ud83e\udee1","author":"vinay_93","url":"https:\/\/www.theblock.co\/post\/210804\/ethereum-cofounder-vitalik-buterin-donates-99-ether-to-ahbap-earthquake-support?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676234677.0},{"title":"ECH Roadmap 2023 & Recap 2022","author":"poojaranjan19","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/111iayc\/ech_roadmap_2023_recap_2022\/","text":"Celebrating the 4th anniversary with the Ethereum community!  \nCheck out the blog post sharing the eventful year 2022 and the plans for 2023.\n\n[https:\/\/medium.com\/ethereum-cat-herders\/ech-roadmap-2023-recap-2022-8eb00c977891](https:\/\/medium.com\/ethereum-cat-herders\/ech-roadmap-2023-recap-2022-8eb00c977891)","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1676318185.0},{"title":"It seems that 2023 is a make-or-break year for blockchain gaming","author":"CombTimee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/111eg3b\/it_seems_that_2023_is_a_makeorbreak_year_for\/","text":"Do you think we will 2023 finally see an explosion of crypto gaming?  \n\n\nConsidering everything I've read and heard, the signs are mixed, with former play-to-earn Axie Infinity falling out of favor and hemorrhaging players, while mainstream gamers report that Web3 games still have playability issues.  \n\n\nThe bright spot is that AAA games are finally starting to emerge in Web3, with projects like Illuvium garnering attention.

Where NFT games cost tons of money to play, and while they\u2019re fun, are just way too unaffordable.\n\nEnter, The Game of Life, on Ethereum. Most NFT games are super engaging, and want you to play every day, like the trillions of games, on Ethereum and non-crypto based. I propose a situation that puts the focus on *you*, and your progression as a human being. \n\nFrom birth, we are born into the ideal of what our parents believe in, they teach us things, and they give us advice. When we reach adulthood, we lead almost boring lives, filled with work, and the upsides of life, like Ethereum! The Game of Life was one of my favorite childhood games to play and made you experience this Tomodachi mini-me who had to face life\u2019s problems, and maybe win the lottery or buy a swanky house.\n\nWhat if, on Ethereum, your life could be documented and gamified into your own board. You play by your rules, get your first job, move somewhere new, or get married. All of these life events would be documented onchain, but not the Google stuff, your birthday or your name. The stuff that *really* matters, like your major life events. \n\nWhen you die, you won\u2019t be left with a gravestone, but a history of *you*, who you were, forever lasting on the blockchain. Your move to Germany or Japan would last forever. On Ethereum, *you* wouldn\u2019t be collecting moss and dead flowers, you would flourish and live on the blockchain.\n\nThis game would still be a play-to-earn game, in the form of LIFE tiles, or my idea, $TILE coin, which would not only be a nice way of earning some crypto, but actually have sentimental value to *you*. These tile coins and NFTs would be a memory that you and Ethereum users will never forget.\n\nWrapping up, is this a good idea? Would you play the game? Would you be comfortable to sharing life events like this for the rewards and memory you receive?\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments below! I will, also, be ensuring that this game is free-to-play with the optional fun of earning more $TILE with NFTs that are fairly priced ($10-50).","upvote_ratio":0.54,"created_utc":1676326259.0},{"title":"Frequently Asked Questions + Weekly Discussion Thread","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/1111yyr\/frequently_asked_questions_weekly_discussion\/","text":"**Welcome to the Weekly Discussion.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThe best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit \/r\/ethstaker for more details\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added?

It essentially acts as collateral; if a validator does something bad like propose two blocks at once, they\u2019ll lose some of their currency at stake (or be slashed, in other words).\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) allow staked funds to be liquid and available for other uses. This is done by issuing tokens that represent the ETH being staked. When someone stakes ETH with a LSD provider, they\u2019ll receive (ERC-20) tokens that allow for the redemption of their deposit. \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l9y99klewdha1.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b80e5d2972df8035ce834ffb31f28d429ef7ea7b\n\nLSDs existed on other chains before Ethereum, including Kusama\/Polkadot for example, where unstaking can involve a 28-day wait period. The reason for LSDs popularity on Ethereum is that until recently, it\u2019s been unclear when withdrawals\/unstaking would become possible. Ethereum withdrawals are now confirmed to be coming with the Shanghai upgrade in March and will be covered in more detail in a future write-up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How LSDs Work\n\nMost LSDs follow the [cToken model](https:\/\/docs.compound.finance\/v2\/ctokens\/). When you stake 1 ETH, you\u2019ll receive a token representing your deposit, 1 *token*ETH. The deposited ETH is pooled together, and grows as it accumulates rewards. You can redeem your deposit and share of rewards by exchanging *token*ETH back for ETH.\n\nIn LSD systems, there isn\u2019t a 1:1 ratio between the token and the staked asset. There will always be less of the *token*ETH than ETH. As ETH the staked grows with rewards, the amount that can be redeemed with *token*ETH does as well. This is the reason why LSD token prices aren\u2019t always the same price that ETH may be at a given time.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/t9sauu7qvdha1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fdbe817242b9fa8ea4c1b04c5e3237d33df46069\n\nThe alternative to LSD is staking on ETH and obtaining rewards on that staked ETH periodically. This can be through staking 32 ETH directly, or programs that offer staking but not a token in return. The rewards are paid out in ETH based on the validator\u2019s performance.\n\nFor example, staking with Coinbase awards a user with a \\~3% yield that is paid in ETH. Alternatively, once you stake with Coinbase you can choose to participate in the LSD and receive cbETH tokens. When you do that, you\u2019ll no longer directly accumulate ETH rewards, you\u2019ll redeem the cbETH for ETH instead for a share of the pools rewards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# LSD Providers\n\nDifferent LSD providers exist with varying pros and cons. According to [Beaconchain](https:\/\/beaconcha.in\/stakingServices), there are as many as 20 staking services to choose from, with up to 7 offering a LSD. Below are the major LSD providers and a quick explanation of each, from most to least centralized.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jgwq2ltlwdha1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21462d3bd25d0a75ef9a189ab8bddd4edcaffc36\n\n# Centralized Exchanges\n\nThere exist centralized exchanges that offer LSDs, these are the most simple solutions but also the most expensive. Centralized exchanges can take up to 30% in fees - that\u2019s 30% of rewards that go to Coinbase before the rest are distributes amongst stakers.\n\nWhen staking with a centralized exchange, the nodes are operated entirely by their staff. Exchanges including Coinbase use the cToken model. It is worth noting that centralized exchanges required identity verification, or KYC, to exchange the LSD ETH for regular ETH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# LIDO\n\nLIDO is one of the first LSD providers on Ethereum. They allow anyone to stake any amount of ETH and receive stETH in return. ETH is distributed to potential validators that are appointed by the LIDO DAO. LIDO charges 10% of rewards, half goes to validators and the other half goes to a DAO treasury that can be used as needed.\n\nLIDO does not use the cToken model described above. Instead, oracles are selected by the DAO to aggregate the balances of all validators using LIDO ETH. Then, based on whether there is a net increase or decrease, the supply of stETH is adjusted. If a day ends with more rewards, some stETH is issued. If not, some stETH is burned. stETH supply is adjusted this way daily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Rocket Pool\n\nRocket Pool has two groups of independent participants, stakers and node operators. Node operators must have at least 16 ETH, and stakers can deposit any amount they\u2019d like. Node operators are complemented with 16 ETH from stakers, which is used to set up a validator node. Node operators take 15% of rewards generated for ETH they stake on behalf of others.\n\nIn Rocket Pool\u2019s case, only stakers are given the rETH LSD, not node operators. This means that node operators obtain their yield directly, whereas stakers receive their reward the LSD way: by exchanging rETH for ETH. Rocket Pool\u2019s LSD uses the cToken model. \n\nWith the upcoming \u201cAtlas\u201d upgrade, Rocket Pool will allow node operators to participate by depositing 8 ETH instead of the current 16.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# In Conclusion\n\nLSDs offer an opportunity to be in two places at once. ETH can accrue yield through staking, and a token equivalent can be used in DeFi to generate additional yield. The flexibility of LSDs make them an attractive option for many stakers getting started. They come at the cost of some reward fees lost, but the benefit is the flexibility and lack of a need to set up a validator node at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i2kx6c0cwdha1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d69c3ff1286c9df134d3fd5b7875c5e3ea70d77b\n\nIt is my hope that LSD providers make staking more accessible, but that more people are able (and willing) to set up their own nodes in the future. There is a serious risk in centralized LSD providers having too much of the ETH staked, but they enable participation in staking for many starting out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot for reading!

Another famous example is Axie Infinity. It is among the most popular NFT games and allows gamers to use NFT to enhance their gameplay.   \n\n\nBut I would never say that these are the Metaverse games, even if they are represented in that way, they are great, I admit that but that's not the point.

And a privacy layer is exactly one such utility. Due to the open nature of blockchain one of the challenges that is commonly faced and needs to be tackled with for the wider adoption of web3 would be configurable privacy. You can't have complete privacy or else you just end up attracting the wrong kind of attention, both from those that are critical of blockchain, and naturally nefarious actors. But we still need privacy to protect users, and to avoid MEV running wild like what happened during the DeFi craze, and NFT minting during the NFT bubble. \n\nFront running is a real problem and having a privacy layer open to all EVM chains that can be easily integrated on EVM chains is in my opinion an important step to both protect users from MEV and also help it scale transactional costs. I don't know about you, but during the DeFi craze it wasn't uncommon to pay hundreds of dollars in gas when you were interacting with various liquidity pools on Ethereum, likely why the rise of other network sprang forth. \n\nAnd while it was nice to interact with them, I felt like the amount of scams, rug pulling and let's face it, out right ponzi schemes were rampant. I ended up losing money myself, and returned to dApps native on Ethereum, paying a higher price, but at least I felt safer. You may have noticed that privacy is getting more spotlights lately, even saw bloomberg's crypto twitter account tweeting about it, and Vitalik has recently co-authored a paper about it (Complete Knowledge: Preventing Encumbrance of Cryptographic Secrets) so a privacy layer that encompasses with the EVM built dApps that allows seamless messaging between the already built protocols with the privacy layer for preserving privacy is something that I personally am super hyped about.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1675702349.0},{"title":"Donation accounts to help the earthquake victims in Turkey.

The FSC will also permit Security Token Offerings (STOs) by making amendments to its Electronic Securities Act.\n\nIn November Todayq News [reported](https:\/\/news.todayq.com\/news\/bitcoin-and-ethereum-are-to-be-referred-exclusively-as-digital-assets-in-south-korea\/) The Special Financial Transactions Act, which was introduced in 2021 by the South Korean government, gave legal status to the concept of digital assets. According to the law, digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum will no longer be referred to as \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d but rather as \u201cDigital Assets.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHowever, the FSC stated that token issuers and brokers, like crypto exchanges, will be required to assess which cryptocurrencies are securities on a case-by-case basis. This is similar to how companies have to self-determine whether they are issuing securities and follow the applicable regulations.\n\nSouth Korean authorities have eagerly looked forward to establishing regulation for crypto assets. They have marked it as a [priority](https:\/\/news.todayq.com\/news\/south-korean-regulator-prioritizes-crypto-regulation-in-their-2023-work-plan\/) for their \u201c2023 Work Plan.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Justice in South Korea also revealed [plans](https:\/\/news.todayq.com\/news\/south-korean-authorities-want-a-crypto-transactions-tracker-to-go-after-criminals\/) to develop a crypto-tracking system dubbed- Virtual Currency Tracking System- to tackle money laundering initiatives and recover funds linked to criminal activities. The country essentially seeks to monitor transaction history, extract transaction-related data, and check the source of funds before and after the remittance.\n\nSources reveal that the newly built system is expected to be deployed in the first half of 2023. According to the South Korean ministry, the development of the tracking and analysis system will start in the second half of the year.\n\nsource: [https:\/\/news.todayq.com\/news\/btc-and-eth-will-not-be-regulated-as-securities-in-south-korea\/](https:\/\/news.todayq.com\/news\/btc-and-eth-will-not-be-regulated-as-securities-in-south-korea\/)","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1675697231.0},{"title":"L2 report vol. 15","author":"sasha_sh","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/paradigm-research\/l2-report-vol-15-a9772cd80b62","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1675684024.0},{"title":"Interactive ZKP simplified","author":"0xSalazar","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/0xsalazar\/status\/1622529320483799040?s=21&t=RxU1OFcjbsp775TkPAlY3g","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1675676280.0},{"title":"Account Abstration: Paying Fees in non native assets","author":"Common_Consideration","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/10v5pr4\/account_abstration_paying_fees_in_non_native\/","text":"Hey guys \n\nI have been reading about account abstractions.

However it is probably contentious. If the IP address of the computer that sent a transaction to the mempool were to be appended to the transaction, would this allow for scammers to be tracked? \n\nAs an aside, I can definitely see how this would be contentious. Everyone from people who are just privacy concious to the people who scoff at the irs would hate this. And if people were to escalate by using vpns, the natural counter of using blacklists that prevent vpn addresses of known vpns from publishing to the eth blockchain creates a situation where someone could add addresses of people they dislike (like hackers or the north korean govt) to the blockchain to block access, and then it becomes a cat and mouse game of moving money by juggling ip addresses. \n\nBut back to the basic premise. Would this assist in stopping the rampant theft occuring on the ethereum blockchain? Could the essence of this idea have safeguards added to it that cut out the potential bad part (along with the ensuing arms race) and still retain the core idea? \n\nFor example, what if the majority of eth stakers had to agree to an unmasking of the IP address, and the ip address were protected behind encryption that could only be broken through mass consensus? This would prevent the power from falling into wrong hands, and ensure its only used by people who have the approval of the entire community to see that specific transaction IP address. \n\nWould this add benefit long term to eth, or are the potential tradeoffs to much?","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1675731180.0},{"title":"If you had to play just one blockchain game for life which one would it be?","author":"M_a_l_f_o_y","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ethereum\/comments\/10vbldv\/if_you_had_to_play_just_one_blockchain_game_for\/","text":"One thing is certain, however, despite the inevitable ups and downs of the cryptocurrency markets: the popularity of play-to-earn blockchain games is only continuing to rise.

If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.\n\n**How can I stake my ETH?**\n\nThe best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.\n\n* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit \/r\/ethstaker for more details\n\n**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**\n\nLike most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.\n\n**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**\n\nEthereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.\n\nAdditionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.\n\nWhile rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/) to learn more about rollups.\n\n**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**\n\nThe most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre there questions you'd like to see added?

I don't want anyone to go through the experience of losing so much money.\n\nI wanted to explore the OpenSea marketplace. I logged in and found two new items in my collection. Truplay #3 - Tru WML Play and Block Riders Pass - Block Riders Tickets. As I didn't recognize either of these items, I presumed that they were airdrops from projects who wanted to get attention. Not completely foreign in the crypto space. As none were of interest to me, I wanted to sell the items.\n\nI attempted to sell both items and received the following error message: \"this order is no longer valid on OpenSea Please refresh the page and try again\". I tried several times, and eventually gave up and moved on with my day.\n\nI didn't realize that my ENS had been drained until two weeks after. $6,500 is a life impacting amount of money. I perceived OpenSea as a reliable and trustworthy site, but that was my downfall. I don't understand how it is possible for these items to be shown in \"Collected\" on OpenSea, and then ending up draining $6,500 of ENS when attempting to sell them. Isn't OpenSea essentially facilitating scammers by providing a false sense of trustworthiness?\n\nTLDR: If you see items in your \"Collected\" view on OpenSea be very careful.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are disregarding OpenSeas responsibility of protecting their users. I understand it ultimately comes down to verifying the contract during signing. However, as a centralized entity (OpenSea) in a decentralized space you have to setup frameworks to protect users. Otherwise you are essentially facilitating scammers by providing a false sense of credibility and trustworthiness. I don\u2019t believe this mentality will scale given larger adoption in the future. Given the size of OpenSea it would make more sense to assume a NFT to be fake and manually verifying it rather than manually marking it as fake. In the long run I think the cryptospace can be better of if we put expectations on centralized companies rather than the user. This is how it works in the non-cryptospace.","upvote_ratio":0.45,"created_utc":1675715660.0}]
