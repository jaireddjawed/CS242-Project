Reason being because any hacker with half a brain cell knows that screenrecordings can easily be edited. \n\nSo concretely, what do they have on him? A video of him jerking it. Whoopee. Maybe they'll edit some kiddy pictures in there before leaking the video, but that doesn't prove shit. Nobody can say for certain that he was looking at kids. \n\nI'm not doubting that he's a pedo. The way he behaves throughout this whole ordeal and complies even when ordered to kill a man, he wouldn't do that if he didn't think it was serious. I'm just saying they'd never be able to prove he was a pedo. \n\nAlso, this guy doesn't seem much of an IT wiz (downloads and installs the first anti malware program off Google without checking if it's trustworthy), so I honestly doubt he had actual child pornography on his laptop. Most likely he was just looking at regular pictures of children. Which is still bad, but not as bad, in my opinion. \n\nMy point is, we see the police arriving at the end, but why? Nothing proves that he was jerking it to child pornography. All there is is a video of him jerking it. And if he was jerking it to regular photos of children, is that even a crime? ",

        "text": "Hated in the Nation discusses many themes, but perhaps one of the biggest is the concept of the online mob. Throughout the episode, we see an online public who has no problem with playing God. After learning the reality of the #DeathTo game, they still willingly participate in greater numbers than ever, picking \"deserving\" people who range from businessmen to celebrities, to online journalists, to just random people guilty of nothing more than posting a dumb, offensive tweet online. And later, we see them pay for it. The perpetrator of the game talked of \"consequences\", but for everyone. For those believing they could hold the power of life and death and destroy people online.  The game was a nationwide act of terrorism, with the perpetrator wanting the public to wake up to the reality of their bloodthirstiness online.\n\nBut the public didn't wake up. They didn't learn anything.\n\nFast forward to the hearing one year in advance, and they are exactly the same. The perpetrator was still walking free, leaving it down to one individual to track him down. But worse, one of the two investigators we had followed for the whole episode, someone who \\(quite literally\\) kicked a bee's nest  and stumbled upon a case far bigger than anyone could've handled, was the target of the public's outrage. Not the perpetrator. Not the Government. Not even the company that created the bees. We see her being screamed at and attacked for being mildly \"in the bad\" by being even associated with the incident, even though there was nothing she could've done and she was even opposed to the shutdown that triggered the nationwide attack.\n\nThe mob mentality was alive and well by the end of the episode, as directionless and bloodthirsty as ever.

        "text": "I think that others have mentioned that Black Mirror all takes place in the same universe.  There are obvious links such as the song that is played or sung in numerous episodes and the similarities with the tech.  There's also the Black Museum episode which seems to tie in quite a few episodes.  \n\nHere's an idea that I think could mean something, so let me know your thoughts:\n\nWe know that soldiers are meant to hunt down roaches in the episode Men Against Fire after there is a genetic deformity that starts to plague mankind.  We find out that these people are not physically deformed toward the end of the episode.  They seem to be using an upgraded version of the (for lack of a better word) eyeball tech that we see in numerous episodes such as \"The Entire History of You\", \"White Christmas\", and \"NoseDive\".\n\nI believe that we end up seeing how this future plays out via \"Metal Head\".  I believe that the characters in this episode are what's left of the roaches after the technology used in \"Men Against Fire\"  starts to fail via usage of the green light.  Soldiers have a problem with the straight up genocide after the implants start to fail and word spreads that the roaches are actually just normal people with a higher disposition for diseases.  The government looks to remove the human element even further by producing machines to do the killing in lieu of soldiers who may have moral qualms.  \"MetalHead\" is all about the contrast between the human element vs. the cold calculating nature of the machines.  Ironically the roaches are what we view as \"humanity\" in this episode whereas the rest of the \"pure\" (for lack of a better term) humans view them as nothing better than dog food (pun intended).  \n\n\"That may seem all well and good, but what happened to the rest of humanity?\", you may ask.  Well I think that we can look to \"15 Million Merits\" on this one.  Rather than risk interbreeding, the last of humanity that is not \"genetically inferior\", move to a space station off of Earth.  There they wait, until the dogs can finish their mission, eradicating what's left of the roaches on Earth before they can go back and recolonize the planet.  We see at the end they are all restricted to this captivity when Bing is upgraded to a better room but the view is still just a screen, albeit better definition and graphics than what others are allowed.  The ultimate dream is getting closer to Earth and what lies ahead for humanity once they are free to go home.\n\nJust what I began to think after watching the show again. Let me know your thoughts.

The hypocrisy of the newest seasons becomes clear when you look at S1E2, 15 Million Merits. 15MM really got to me because it hit on technology, economic class, celebrities, objectification, etc. But most importantly, the main takeaway is that the main character rebels against these problems, spouting conscious views and even considering killing himself... all for his serious conscious views to be commodified and sold to the masses in easily digested segments that only further the system that he rebelled against. The changes made for season three and especially season four of Black Mirror were intentional choices made to be easily digested by the Netflix/American audience. People are afraid of confronting the relevant questions that the series provokes... so the writers adjusted and commodified their message to become like any other typical sci\\-fi that spouts Western ideals and doesn't question the system.",

I think it got heavily Americanised, which might be good for some, but in my opinion I just don’t like it very much. Especially the latest series, they saw the wave of San Junipero lovers (I was one of them) and tried to make every other episode like it. Didn’t love the blockbuster type of the USS Callister either. I will say though, I’m not hating on it, still love the show, but just don’t think it’s as good as it was (sorry to be one of those people). I don’t know, anyone else think the same thought, I know I’m probably in the minority. ",

Up to Season 3 now and honestly, I'm having trouble seeing it. \n\nIt feels like the show goes in a direction that gets a bigger twist, but in doing so makes it less realistic and less of a valid critique of society and technology. As an example, what prompted me to come here was White Christmas. Sure, I can sort of suspend my disbelief enough to believe that this futuristic society doesn't see the blatant evil in the mistreatment of cookies, but the registry punishment? That's like \"muahahaha\" evil. How would one even survive without being able to communicate to anyone? Not to mention their expressions when they deliver the news is blatantly indulgent- they may as well be twirling moustaches.\n\nAnyways, like I said, the show is much more enjoyable with the mindset that they are fully aware of this but the response from the fans of the show lead me to belief this isn't the case. With that mindset, I can't help constantly roll my eyes at how ridiculous some of the ideas are.\n\nWhat's your opinion?",

What concept or idea would YOU write as a BM episode? I’ll get to writing a comment myself. There are so many creative, lovely people in this community— I just know a few ideas are brewing in you minds—-and it’ll give us all something to think about, and to read until my fix for a new season  is released.\n\nWhat do ya think?

It came up on Daly's apartment frequently, the little houses in Hang the DJ, the home in Metalhead, Mia's hotel room, etc. Just wanted to know if anyone's noticed a pattern or if there's anything significant!",

During the scene where Cooper is repeatedly screaming \"get out of my head\" a fucking silverfish crawled right onto my hand and I was already sketched about the spiders in the episode. To make matters worse, I turned on my flashlight to see where it went and it was gone. Was it even real or did I imagine it? I felt the sensation but so did Cooper \n\nFuck this show",

Later, when Rolo talks about Clayton permanent torture, he refers to the keychains as “fun size” meaning Nish has heard of the phrase before (most likely from her mother.)",
