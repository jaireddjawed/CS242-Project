Today when I was watching 15 million merits a second to time I analyzed the lyrics more carefully. It seems wrong for the song to be carried across all 4 seasons unless it had some sort of significant meaning. In the context of this episode I assumed that Abi was singing a love song not to Bing, But to the system that they live in. A system of forced labor Would hardly be loved by anyone, Making it plausible for the system to only be loved by someone who benefits from it like Bing and Abi at the end, Which is why she says \"The world may think I'm foolish they don't see you like I can but anyone who knows what love is will understand.\" \n\nThe same is true about \"systems\" in other episodes where the song is sung, like the MASS system in \"Men Against Fire\" when sung by Raiman, the soldier who loved what she did and Shazia to the surveillance state that she profits from.

        "text": "Inside Number 9 is a british series quite similar to black mirror. Every episode is it’s own independent story and 30 minutes long. At the end of most episodes there’s a twist that changes the entire episode and almost every one is told in an extremely unique way. There’s one told in security cam footage, one told without any dialogue, one filmed in the style of a 70s horror, one told backwards and one told in  memories. The one thing all episodes have in common is that the story plays entirely inside of the number nine. It could be a shoe size, an apartment number or an address. The two writers Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton play the main roles in most episodes, which is also pretty interesting to see. Seasons 3 and 4 can be found on netflix, 1 and 2 are on britbox I believe, but you‘ll be able to find them somewhere in the dark corners of the internet fairly easily. I highly recommend you this series, as it really is amazing. Some especially good episodes are se2 ep2 „12 days of christine“, se1 ep2 „A quiet night in“, se4 ep1 „Zanzibar“ and se1 ep3 „Tom and gerri“. [Here](https://youtu.be/71YO8veX7wM) is an amazing video that reviews the entire show and „12 days of christine“ in particular. But do keep in mind that the amazing twist of that episode will be spoiled for you. That‘s all, I found this series after finishing black mirror and I honestly think it‘s even better than bm. Some episodes are an absolute masterpiece, so please watch it, you won‘t regret doing so. Cheers, and enjoy",

        "text": "The dry walls of Scott’s airy mansion had once been painted a dark shade of blue. It had always been his favourite colour. He remembered his days as a young schoolboy, always having to respond to the question regarding his favourite colour with the same old boring response. Blue was after all possibly the most mainstream response for boys to this question at that age; girls of course chose pink. Scott did not like the popularity blue enjoyed since he viewed his connection with blue to be deeper than that of the other boys, but he could never put it in words or even justify it to himself in his young mind.\n\nThe dark shade of blue on his walls had by now met the same fate as his favourite shirt. Living all alone within those dry walls lay Scott, a man who had experienced everything and nothing, just wishing for something more. He wasn’t sure what it was that he was pining after. He had achieved everything that he had been told to achieve. His schooling had yielded great results for him both academically and socially, registering a whopping 372 Peers, just falling short of Pete Smith’s 386. He went on to attend Dalrymple University, the most elite engineering school in the country. There too, he registered 564 Peers, which was a great achievement considering the University had only 700 students. This helped him land a well-paying job with space giants BLASA, where he had worked for the past 22 years. Somewhere past his 4th year of working at BLASA, Scott had purchased the house he was now laying pensively in. \n\nBy all standards of measurement Scott’s life had been a roaring success. He was treated cordially by most people, as his Peer stats had shown throughout his life. He had purchased his own house, car, and drew a handsome salary at BLASA. He had climbed up the ranks over the years, now holding the position of Director. He had donated his sperm at age 28 as was required and had been informed that his contribution had led to a successful birth when he was 33. There were times when he wondered who it was that had been borne out of his sperm and who it was that had given birth to this child. But these thoughts were highly infrequent and emerged purely out of curiosity and boredom. He knew that the answers were inconsequential. \n\nHe couldn’t say that he was unhappy. How he felt now was how he had felt his entire life. Happy. He had lived the life everyone had lived. He had grown up in the same school, the same hostel, gone to a better university than most, worked at a better company than most, and earned more money than most. He was certainly happy. Yet there seemed to be something which poked at him. A feeling of unfulfillment, perhaps. How he had essentially felt his entire life. Nothing had changed. Nothing was going to change. He would grow older, and in 15 years he would kill himself, as everyone did. Making himself a scotch-on-the-rocks, he walked out to his garden where he noticed the drying walls. “I ought to get them repainted,” he thought to himself. ",

But a hacker? They could easily just be doing it to get someone in mass amounts of trouble for their own entertainment.\n\n(Of course this is just a hypothetical qustion if this episode happened in real life, I loved the episode)",
