(Personally I think whatifalthist's vid on South east Asian civilizations is his worst one, it hardly explained how Thailand got to where it is today, which is why Thailand is on the list) Like how 3 of these countries managed to avoid being colonized, yet only one of those 3 ended up 1st world and how SK was colonized and still ended up 1st world. Why is Japan so much less exploitative and corrupt than the rest and South Korea after it? I wanna know the anthropology &amp; societal history behind it, rather than just that ''cold countries are generally richer'' And ''Landlocked countries are generally poorer''  I read the parts about the history of the muslim world from ''A history of civilizations by Fernand Braudel'' And it barely dipped into what I was looking for (although it did contain a bit of data that I enjoyed that I wasn't looking for when I began it)üì∑EnterWrite to Justinian Girgis",

Looking at him in that decedent room with all his finery, surrounded by the pope and other Catholic clergy, I couldn't help but think, \"this looks an awful lot like monarchy\". I imagine it must have looked that way to a lot of French revolutionaries too. At the very least it was a far cry from secular, egalitarian ideals. Even in the process of becoming an autocrat, wouldn't Napoleon have been conscious to avoid such a regal aesthetic? That fact he declared himself emperor seems to kind of mock the revolution he helped to succeed. \n\nThen I watched a summary of French history by the YouTube channel Wonderwhy and I learned that the French monarchy was restored after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo (didn't know that). France was ruled by various monarchs until 1848, and after that they had an emperor, again until 1870. That's nearly 100 years after the US declared itself a republic. \n\nAll this makes the French Revolution seem anticlimactic in hindsight. But the revolution in the popular imagination is often used as shorthand for the death of absolute monarchy in Europe. At least, that's how I remember it being taught in school. If it was just a case of swapping one guy in a fancy robe and crown for another, and didn't even end monarchy in France for good, why is it considered so momentous?",

        "text": "I have recently come to learn more about the Valladolid Debates and the various laws and papal declarations regarding protections of indigenous Americans throughout the 16th century. I am looking for a source that provides detailed overviews of the apparently varying attitudes of different parts of Spanish society such as the monarchy, the merchants, the conquistadors, the missionaries of various religious orders, the Catholic hierarchy up to the papacy (not part of Spain but certainly a major influence on its cultural and political attitudes) and the settlers of Spanish territory in the New World.\n\nFrom what I‚Äôve read, there seems to have been conflicting and evolving views over things such as the justification of conversion, the treatment of indigenous peoples, and the rights thereof. There also seems to have been a disconnect between what was prescribed (or at least nominally prescribed) by political, secular, and religious authorities and what was actually implemented in the colonies, which was often exceedingly brutal. \n\nSome standout examples that demonstrate this that I‚Äôm aware of are how Columbus likely lied to Isabella about the natives to justify their enslavement until she had him removed and brought back to Spain- was that actually out of concern for the natives or did her own interests change- and the trial and execution of Don Carlos Ometochtzin which was part of the Mexican inquisition, but I‚Äôve read that it was controversial among the Spanish.\n\nSome things I‚Äôd be interested in such sources covering are: How widespread were the various views among the different societal components? Were there any concerted efforts to enforce the Laws of Burgos, the Sublimes Deus, or the New Laws on the part of the monarchy or did they they take a hands off approach that paid lip service to recognizing rights of the indigenous peoples while allowing the colonizers to do as they will? If the latter, was it a purposeful decision to enhance their own interests or a result of competing parts of Spain‚Äôs power structure? How did the approaches Spain and the Catholic Church took towards indigenous Americans compare to their approach towards other non-Christian peoples in Spain and elsewhere such as the native Africans? Was there a Sublimus Deus equivalent regarding African slavery and if not, why? Did early sympathetic views towards indigenous Americans impact the roles that clergy often took in communities and anti-colonial revolutions later on? \n\nI know, that‚Äôs a lot of questions for a very broad topic and hoping for a singular book that covers even half of that in any depth may be asking too much. But if there are any sources that come close or if anyone has information to share in the comments I‚Äôd love to hear them.",

        "text": "I want to know what a dinner experience was like for a wealthy family in the Roman Empire, particularly around the 1st Century CE. It's difficult to find a publication that gives a holistic and comprehensive account of what it would be like to have a fun Saturday night at a friends' dinner party at the height of the Roman Empire.\n\nThere are plenty of resources on Roman meal customs, manners, and cuisine, but not many resources that imbue those variables with the social experience of having a fun dinner party. Are there any historians out there who can speak to what dinner would have been like? What happen's when you arrive? How are people arranged around the table? Do they bring their own napkins? Do they really lounge while they eat? How many courses are there? What was for dinner and what was for dessert? How drunk did people get? Were they drinking more than mixed wine? How was the wine mixed? What were people wearing?\n\nI'd love if any historians out there can give a walkthrough of a dinner party and help me imagine it, something I've wanted to do for a long time. I recognize answers may differ across social classes and regions of the Roman Empire, so for the purposes of conciseness, I'll say I'm focusing on a wealthy family in Rome with a patrician background. If you have examples of elsewhere in the Roman Empire or of different social classes, please feel free to add those as well! Excited to learn more.",

Of course, that‚Äôs not entirely accurate because a.) it‚Äôs incredibly fatiguing to fight for more than 30 seconds at a time, b.) that‚Äôs not how armies work, and c.) it‚Äôs not an effective means of strategy. However, when it came to cavalry-on-cavalry battles like Gaugamela or Zama how exactly did cavalry engage one another? Was it structured like infantry? Was it more of a scrum? There are references to Caesar having to deal with Gallic infantry mixed in with the cavalry, but that seems to imply the latter. Furthermore, did cavalry expend their lances in the initial charge and then use swords when the fighting got closer, or was it more common to try and engage and disengage repeatedly? TIA",

Did Putin‚Äôs early life feature any kind of hints or markers that are common in narcissists and the other personality types and disorders common in sexual abusers and pedophiles? \n\nAlso has Russian propaganda and disinformation always focused heavily on accusing everyone opposed to their leadership of being pedophiles with vast pizza conspiracies and networks of child sex trafficking among the elite, like has been witnessed over the last decade or so in Russian active measures, or was that something that became more common in the last 20 years under Putin?  Is it maybe an example of the vaguely attributed quote about ‚Äúaccuse the enemy of that which you are guilty‚Äù that‚Äôs always common in authoritarian propaganda?",

        "text": "I applied to several graduate programs for history and now have to decide which program to attend. The two schools I am interested in attending are both in the same state, as my spouse wants to live there. I am attending grad school through a program offered by my employer so I will continue to receive my salary and my tuition is covered. Their only requirement is that I earn the MA.\n\nMy dilemma lies in the programs I was admitted for. My ‚Äútop choice‚Äù school admitted me for an MA, and my second choice for a PhD. My concern is the ranking of the programs (I am basing this information solely on the history rankings provided by US News, if this is a false assumption please let me know). The school that has admitted me for the MA is ranked 11th and the school offering me a PhD is 67th. Both of my potential advisers are awesome so no concerns there. The location of the MA school is a lot more desirable for us but we are not against moving to the PhD school. \n\nThis may be my only opportunity to attend grad school so I want to make the most of it, bottom line is I would love to get the PhD. If I go for the MA I may never have the opportunity to go back for the PhD due to life/family commitments. I know the job market for historians is bleak at best and the university ranking carries a lot of weight when applying for jobs. I will have some flexibility when looking for employment as I will have a pension from my current job, it is not enough to retire for good though. I would love to teach history as a second career. \n\nMy first thought is that the PhD will give me more options for employment in the future versus the MA. I am concerned that the ranking of the program will limit my opportunities and I will be stuck based on the university name on the top of my diploma. \n\nIf I attend the MA school I can reapply for their PhD program and roll the dice on getting accepted next year, but I‚Äôll only have 1 chance. \n\nI would greatly appreciate any thoughts or advice from the community.",

Was it simply so isolated from the rest of Europe that sick people didn't travel there? Were they cleaner than the rest of Europe? Did the virus mutate and become less dangerous by the time it arrived? Did the Poles know to deal with the rats? I'd like to know what the historical consensus is (if any) on this question.\n\nThank you!",

Didn't whites get told that blacks were violent, and all their life saw the stories about whites being raped or beaten by blacks, and got angry about it? Besides just this one example, there must be lots of ways in which whites must've really hated the blacks, and it doesn't make sense to my why not a single instance of genocide happened to them, its a real mystery.\n\nI'm not some old white guy who grew up a long time ago, if you are, how was the white perception of blacks when it comes to genociding them? That might help understand a little of why it didn't happen back then.\n\nWhen I saw sites like genocidewatch list all these situations and make genocide seem common, it also reinforced my notion it was really common but it isn't, most of the times its just a few clashes, even when they had a whole \"race war\" over it like in Sri Lanka.",
