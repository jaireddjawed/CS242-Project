        "text": "To clarify, not just the last episode of a TV show to be produced or aired, but one which is clearly intended by the writers as a narrative ending for the show and its characters.\n\nThe earliest example that I know of is the finale of the series \"The Fugitive\", in which the one-arm man is killed and Dr, Kimble's name is finally cleared.  From what I've read of it, the revelation of some surprise eyewitness to Kimble's wife's murder, after four seasons, is a bit \"deus ex machina\"-ish, but it's impressive that it happened at all.  Network executive weren't terribly interested in a finale, since they assumed most TV viewers watch shows in passing or had them on in the background (perhaps since these were men who would've grown up with radios).  I've also head the studio was dubious, since a finale would supposedly harm viewership for syndication, though I don't know if that's true.\n\nI'd been under the assumption that there was a finale of \"Gilligan's Island\", in which the castaways are rescued, but apparently I was mistaken, and the finale was just another wacky island adventure.\n\nWere there other TV shows from that era that provided viewers with some closure in their last episode, rather than just another generic adventure?",

The humor is racy, but doesn’t push it too far to be offensive, it’s self aware, but not annoyingly meta. It effectively adds intrigue and lore to Cleveland and his family, making him one of the most interesting characters in the Sethiverse. We get to see Cleveland’s contention with his father’s love, and we even see him gain it, we see him grow closer to both his children and wife, and we hold on to some of that continuity in a way that Seth’s other shows don’t do as often. This show was actually kind of succeeding at what it was attempting, and was cut too short. Jr alone is super interesting and has a lot going on with his character.",

I hope this one finds its groove and while I appreciate the same tone and style as the original, I’m wondering if it’ll have long term appeal. I wish they did a few different things to give it its own voice. Curious what others who saw the original think about this version. \n\n- It’s good to see Melissa Rauch back on TV after The Big Bang Theory, but I think the story would have been played better as her character being the Assistant DA. Would have been fun to see her go toe to toe with Dan Fielding as a peer, much less more believable. She comes across as young in her career and it would be better to see her start out as a ADA and grow into and aspire to be the judge one day \n- Great to see Dan Fielding back on TV \n- I like the bailiff, but it seems they tried to create a look and vibe to Marsha Warfield, without the sarcastic wit. I like the actress, but I wish her character was allowed to be a completely new kind of identify that suits her",

The France scenes are filmed to make the French seem as alien as possible - giving us the fish-out-of-water feeling that Adams must have had. The Holland scenes often look like a Rembrandt or Vermeer painting. Absolutely great cinematography.",

Their houses actually look pretty expansive if not suburban so those two lines brought me out the immersion.\n\nThere’s moments when I can tell they’re appealing to the white demographic.

But episodes 5 onward (7 &amp; 8 just came out) seem… actually decent? The jokes can still be a bit cringe, and Velma is still a terrible person in this show, but if I remove my righteous indignation at the characters’ personalities changing and just focusing on the show by itself, it feels like the latest episodes have a new level of self-awareness now that all the main characters are bouncing off of one another.\n\nIt’s by no means a masterpiece, but it’s like.. surprisingly fine and even manages a chuckle from me occasionally…? Am I crazy?",

        "text": "Everyone, this is just a minor opinion  but have you wondered why Warner bros discovery is greenlit Velma and give it a 2 early season renewal similar to the animaniacs reboot.  If they want the viewers to appreciate the mature scooby doo reimagining spinoff, they could have at least have test audience to check on the show and make the viewers and critics appreciate it but instead , WBD didn't use test audience, they give the show a 2 early season order and now the series has become critically panned by both audience and critics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite that , it gets huge viewership which means Warner Bros Discovery would gain profit meaning that they don't care about the critics and audience reception, they want more viewership and more profit as if they care about controversial viewership  and now they are renewing the Velma series for a second season as planned , they should retool the Velma show be attracted to both audience and critics during season 2 so that it will be renewed for season 3, if not  and if it continues like the first season,  then the show won't be renewed for season 3 and will be cancelled unless if warner bros discovery change their minds and cancel the series by reversing the early season 2 order or maybe the upcoming writers strike guild which will likely cause WBD to cancel the show.\n\nAlso, I think that the cause of the upcoming writers guild strike is due to the recession in the entertainment industry and cancelation of every shows like inside job for example.",

        "text": "While watching South Park I noticed one of it’s characters, Mr Garrison, reminded me of a lot of other characters I’d seen in animation before. Mr Garrison is almost always accompanied by a hand puppet he calls Mr Hat, a hand puppet with his own (usually for the purpose of a gag) personality that is often somehow out of pocket and screwed up.\nI’ve seen this before. A character who controls and is incredibly connected to their hand puppet, a hand puppet that more often than not has it’s own personality and can act independently of it’s puppeteer.\nDespite searching, I couldn’t actually find any other good examples aside from Nekozawa from Oreon Highschool Host Club with his cat hand puppet and Yoshino from Date a Live.\nIf you guys can find any other examples please let me know. I was just wondering if anybody could try to explain this trope. Is there some kind of reason for it? Was there a “first” to do this trope? It’s so oddly specific that there has to be, right? Why is this so rarely pointed out?",
