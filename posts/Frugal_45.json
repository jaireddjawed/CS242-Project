        "text": "I was considering replacing my toilet so I could save money on my water bill and \"do the right thing.\"  My city hasn't had a water shortage in the entire time I've lived here, so \"do the right thing\" might not apply.  My toilet is as old as my house, almost 100 years, and by the size of the tank it looks like it was using 5 gallons per flush.\n\nI did a lot of research.  Along the way I learned that homes with septic systems need to be careful replacing old toilets with water conserving toilets; sometimes the replacement will cause the sewage pipe to clog as there's not enough water to get the waste all the way to the septic tank.\n\nAnother video talked about a similar problem, but with aging cast iron pipes.\n\nThat got me thinking.  I've inspected the pipes, and while the drain for the toilet is PVC it dumps into an old cast iron pipe that goes underneath my basement floor.  That cast iron pipe is probably as old as the house, and is at least 50 feet long.\n\nI found a great 1.28 gpf toilet that I was going to buy.  It has a good flush, and it was on sale at Lowes.  It was not the cheapest toilet, but from what the plumbing guy said, it would last a long, long time.  \n\nI was getting ready to leave for Lowes this morning when I decided I ought to *actually measure the amount of water my old toilet uses.*  I opened the tank and was surprised to see that the tank was almost a foot taller than the height of the water in it.  I measured; 8\" deep, 19\" wide, 5\" between front and back of tank, for a total of 570 cubic inches.  570 cubic inches is about 2.5 gallons.  So it was not using the 5 gallons I thought it did.  \n\nMy toilet is 2.5 gallons per flush.  The new toilet would be 1.28 gallons per flush, so I'd save about a gallon and a quarter every time I flush the toilet.  HOWEVER, I'd be risking building a clog in the cast iron pipe.  I expected a savings of around 4 times.  Instead, at most, I'd save about half the water.\n\nFor me, it is not worth risking a sewage backup for what would amount to less than $10 per month in savings on my water bill.  And if I apply the $270 cost of the toilet to my water bill, I'm flushing for free for the next two+ years.",

        "text": "I see a lot of people complain about how expensive pet toys are, considering they often get destroyed.\n\nI have two methods of making pet toys out of old clothes. The first one uses old mismatched socks - most people have some. I figured out that I could take a very tall sock, use smaller ones to stuff it, and then cut the top part in half and tie it to keep the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù inside. The ends of the knot look like ears and you can draw a bunny face. My dog loved this toy more than his store-bought ones, and I made some others for friends. They are pretty safe even if your dog rips it open, the sock stuffing is hard for them to swallow/choke on or consume (some pets eat toys and get sick.)\n\nThe second is so simple. I cropped a t-shirt and noticed my cat liked to play with the leftover fabric tube. So when I cropped another shirt I tied the two leftover pieces together and I can fling it around, he loves it.\n\nSort of a boring post, but pets don‚Äôt need fancy toys. They just need love, attention, and something cheap to play around with. I think a lot of people are overwhelmed by how much they love their pets and fall for marketing for stuff we really don‚Äôt need.",

I attempted touch up paint (as you can see it does not even match, bought from certified Honda paint supplied using exact paint code), applied some masking tape around my work area, and even more paint came off with the paint. This whole project has been a nightmare.\n\nBody shop wants $1700 to remove and repaint the entire roof panel. My concern is other areas of the car will eventually chip away as well. \n\nThe car is in great mechanical shape. 75k miles and no issues. KBB value is about 14k private party. Wife wants to sell it and buy something else. I'm terrified of buying any car at the top of the market. I'm pulling my hair out on what to do. Nobody would even buy it now in this condition.",

Online it was listed at $4/pound, but when I picked up my order I noticed it was actually on sale for $2/pound. I just finished slicing it up, vacuum sealing half of it for the freezer, and put the rest in the fridge. I got a total of 3.1 pounds for $6, which normally would have gotten me a little over 1 pound of prescliced ham. Now we have sliced ham and some cubed ham for casseroles for a fraction of the cost.

My wage just dissappear the first week after getting it and it doesn't seem as my mother is lying to me (she shows me the receipts from the shop and bank). Helping the family is a decision I made on my own but recently my mother has also started asking money from my brother. While it's nice that he is helping I dont think this situation is gonna solve fastly and he has all life ahead.At first I wanted him to help but I was just anxious that we wouldn't be able to eat the last weeks of the month and was affected because I had to sell one of my most important possession due to him buying a frigging gaming laptop. I wanna do something so he has a chance to leave this household and live his own life.\nThe first step would be to reduce my milk intake , as a 6-pack of milk now costs 50% more than the previous years. \nI just drink a cup of milk and some cookies for breakfast so I thought the experts here could recommend me a mildly acceptable breakfast that don't make me wanna cry thinking of the economic situation. I was thinking that peanut butter would be a good solution as it's 14‚Ç¨ for a jar that would last me a month. If I cannot change the way my family views the world , I will change myself to set an example.\nWhat would be the most cost effective breakfast that you know?\nThank you in advance\nBtw , I'm spanish if that helps",

        "text": "I‚Äôm 20m and live my parents and attend college. I work part time earning ~$500 each paycheck and put 50% towards my savings. I pay my own gas, sometimes food, and all of the insurance on my car. \n\nHowever my family always say I cheap out too much when it comes to food or going out. When it comes to food, I usually get something that is under $15 that is healthy enough yet covers for 2 meals for myself. This is only when my mom doesn‚Äôt cook and wants us to buy our own food. Or whenever I‚Äôm at work, my parents would order takeout for me when they‚Äôre ordering their own. \n\nI don‚Äôt occasionally go out for fun. I usually hit the gym. But on certain occasions like snowboarding this year I can spend up to $50 per trip. This excludes the pass I bought. Or having fun such as bouldering and going to the beach which could be $30. I would also spend on things to splurge myself when I think I saved well enough on Amazon or an upgrade. \n\nFor this year I already bought gifts for some of my family members because they asks if I got anything for them. So far I spent $100 because they‚Äôre kids. My uncle ask whether I got him anything and starts ranting how he spent for me and all I‚Äôm doing is giving him my ps4 which I no longer use. He proceeded to say ‚Äúyou need to stop being cheap and start spending‚Äù. One of the reason is that I don‚Äôt want anyone to get me anything is because in turn I feel obligated to buy them a gift in return.\n\nSo am I bad for being cheap/frugal?",

In the end I had that shopping cart waiting for me for 2 or 3 days. My frugal soul was struggling...hard, real hard. A frugal fight ensued. Some heavy weight baselayer pants reduced by 75%!, oh my! a baselayer heavy weight T-shirt reduced the same!, a snuggly microfiber sweater for only $15 on top ..reduced of course (and reasonable quality..we know that quality counts too), and it all came with a free baseball cap, well if you drop your e-mail for even more \"savings\". That was real tempting. I mean c'mon....what frugal soul would be able to resist?\n\nWell, I did ......but it was tough, real tough and still not over it :-) I pulled out the storage boxes underneath the bed with the warm stuff in it. I \"found\" my old and trusty winter jumper, that's what they call the heavyweight sweaters made of Irish wool, and some Longjohns and long-sleeved T-shirts made from good old cotton and that still have no holes...and I also still have a couple of baseball hats that are looking not overly shabby.\n\nThe \"frugal\" temptation was definitely there. I persisted, tho, by being real \"cheap\" and not buying anything. A real cheapskate so to say.\n\nHow about you, frugal or cheap like me? \n\n..and do you sometimes feel as if all that \"frugal\" saving with all the coupons and saving apps and buy it for life again and again is more like a clever \"frugal\" marketing gimmick so that we buy stuff we actually don't need?  Frugal has gone mainstream, no doubt, and marketing is right behind it...to make sure to be frugal and not being such a horrible cheapskate like me.",
