        "text": "Truth is, I'm not sure. This isn't a general guide for keeping disussions on topic like you would irl. A few obvious measures are asking questions at the end of your comments and not pointing fingers at commenters. \n\n**Downvoting:**\n\nBut a less obvious measure is the power of the downvote. For whatever reason, people pay attention more to the comments that have better karma (go figure). So, a way to keep the comment chain going is to upvote people you disagree with. Rather than ignoring them, upvote them for responding.\n\n**Googling:**\n\n Also, redditors tend to love research. Even one google search prior to posting is enough to garner a reply. It's also a great way to improve yourself as a life long learner. \n\n**Length:**\n\nAnother way to keep discussion going is length. I am not a person of many words, so I struggle to get comments longer than 10 words. I'm also a believer in concise responses. The thing is, when someone sees a really long reply in their inbox they become more inclined to respond because of guilty conscious. \n\n**Overall:**\n\nThese certainly aren't foolproof methods to keeping a discussion going. Sometimes people just don't care and only came to the thread to get their 10 cents out. But, every once in a while you find some redditors who are very knowledgeable on subjects and you just want to get every bit of info out of them. \n\n",

        "text": "Intro:\n\nReddit has developed over time its value of the anonymous profile. While early in the Reddit days, the anonymous poster was encouraged. There was little stipulation for posting to subreddits as a first time poster and there were not really any ways of verifying any accounts. Currently, we exist in a state of partial anonymity. People have their own usernames, which can be traced through use of tags. Also, some accounts on things like AMAs use their actual identities. \n\nMy question:\n\nWhat amount of anonymity is correct? \n\n\n- Reddit profiles - Most of you would probably agree that linking Facebook profiles to Reddit is not the way to go, but should we have a system of Reddit profiles similar to that of Myspace? Bill Gates once did an AMA. Long after that, he submitted a link to some random subreddit but did not get any recognition (for a bit) because no one knew he was the real guy. Some personal page sort of bio could help fix this issue. \n\n- Create an anonymous button - user clicks \"post anonymously\" and the content comes up as anonymous. This would be a fix for the problem of throwaway accounts\n\n- Allow subreddits to either not allow anonymous posters or only allow anonymous posters (/r/4chan would love that)\n\nFollowup:\n\nWhat should be the extent of anonymous posting on Reddit? Any other ideas? Discuss.\n\n ",

        "text": "This is just an idea I've been rolling around in head for the past while. I put forward the claim that the average post for which the title is a question are of a lower quality and produce lower quality discussion than posts for which the title is phrased in most other ways. As to proving this, because of course there is no objective measure of 'quality' for contributions to a discussion this is not something I can't slap down some evidence for beyond linking to specific posts which isn't a terribly good justification for a theory. As such the way I intend on going about establishing this is to describe the construction of your average post with a question title which I will try to establish as being endemic to posts with questions as titles.\n\nI'm leaving aside posts which use questions to an obvious grandstanding effect (\"ELI5: Why don't Muslamics condemn murder\" et al.), my reason being that these types of post are not really created with the motivation of getting an answer or sparking a proper discussion. I'm of the view that the average question-post is created with the best intentions of either seeking an answer to a question or creating a wholesome forum for discussion about something to generate valuable content. \n\nDespite this 'good' motivation the quality of such posts are still poor, the main reason for this being the low barrier for entry structuring a post in such a way facilitates. The easiest way to highlight this is to use this post as an example; imagine if I have positioned the post in the following format: \"Should subreddits like /r/truegaming and /r/TheoryOfReddit ban posts with questions as the title?\". Hypothetically, I could contribute the exact same content I'm posting now. But I am also granted the ability to merely use the 'body' of the post to just re-state the questions: \"A lot of the posts with questions as the title I've seen are of lower quality than posts with a proper title. What are your opinions on this.\". With this I've basically said nothing, but positioning the post as a question allows me to do this; it allows me to put forward a theory or argument without doing the leg work of defending an idea.\n\nThis isn't an entirely original theory on my part, there is [Betteridge's law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines) which says something similar in relation to newspaper articles. The motivation is different however, and a lot more innocent, I would argue; while the instances dealt with by Betteridge's law use questions to inflate an otherwise non-story into something sell-able, the format of post I'm dealing with use questions to inflate a weak or non-existant contribution into something for which the OP hopes can garner 'good' contributions (good contributions being those which offer valuable, be it entertaining or informative content). There are of course exceptions to this rule (to both of these rules) but as a general meter for contributions I think it would be effective to subreddits trying to cultivate involved discussion and valuable content to ban posts structured in such a fashion.",

        "text": "Over the last few months it has become common to see complaints about the unchanging nature of the front page, with new material appearing on a daily rather than hourly basis.\n\nPeople have been ascribing this change to a new \"front page algorithm\", which reddit inc. has denied.\n\nHowever, there is another explanation for this effect.\n\nPeople with accounts on reddit are subscribed to a selection of subreddits in which they are interested. Anyone with any history on reddit, especially one immersed enough in reddit to make comments about its operation, is likely to be subscribed to several hundred subreddits at a time.\n\nThe cause of the static front page is not the front-page algorithm, but an interaction with a user's subscriptions.\n\nThe front page until recently was composed of a random selection of 50 subreddits (100 with gold) chosen on an hourly basis. With a mixture of active and inactive subreddits, this choice would in reality come from a much smaller selection,\n\nThus, many people would get stories from a small fixed set of their subreddits, changing hourly.\n\nDeimorz recently implemented a change to reddit's operation in which the selection of subreddits chosen was limited to only subreddits that had been active in the last day.\n\nThis selection of active subreddits is more likely to be under the 50 (or 100) subreddit limit, and thus is likely to remain unchanging on an hourly basis.\n\n\n\nThus, a change which on the face of it seems to improve reddit has had the unintended consequence of making reddit appear static and unchanging.\n\nFor those with reddit gold, this effect would be more severe.\n\nInstead of a deep view of a small selection of subs, the change has resulted in a shallow view of a large number of subs.\n\nThe only fix I can see for this effect is to encourage people to use more multis.",

The comment laid out the rational argument against Reddit's self-promotion policy and showed that a significant portion of redditors feel the same way.\n\nI'd like to go a little deeper into this topic and explain how Reddit's self-promotion policy creates problems for Reddit.\n\n**Creators are discouraged from sharing their content on Reddit**\n\nThis is seen as a positive result by some (possibly most), but it actually comes with negative consequences. Reddit has become one of the preeminent platforms for finding and launching new content into prominence. By discouraging creators from sharing their content, Reddit is missing out on new opportunities to discover the next awesome thing online and share it with the world.\n\nReddit is also deprived of interacting with creators. There are subreddits like /r/IAmA that is dedicated to this type of interaction, but it'd be great if creators were welcome in every subreddit so users could ask them questions about their content and have meaningful engagements.\n\n**Creators still self-promote, but under false pretenses**\n\nInstead of inviting creators to share their work and then be accessible to questions and discussion, creators share their work anyway and pretend they didn't create it. Some users even go further and try to buy upvotes to help their content be seen on Reddit. The anti-self-promotion policy actually incentivizes dishonesty and deception.\n\n**The self-promotion policy itself is anti-Reddit**\n\nReddit is supposed to be a place where content is judged on its merits. It is by no means a perfect meritocracy and you could argue it is a bad one, but it strives to be one. If content should be voted on based on the value of the content itself, then why does it matter who shared it?\n\nAlso, the self-promotion policy is largely administered by the moderators of subreddits. Due to the subjective nature of this policy, moderators often make decisions on what is removed based on their own opinions about a piece of content or the user submitting it. Instead of letting the community vote on the value of a piece of content, a moderator can simply remove it because \"self-promotion\". This centralization of power is not congruent with the overall philosophy of Reddit.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nWell there is no simple or perfect solution to this problem. The more open a platform becomes to self-promotion, the more likely it is to be abused. One possible way to tackle this problem would be for the admins to crowdsource ideas from the community and then start experimenting with the best ideas on a small scale to see if there is a solution that could work.",

Weed, guns, taxes, student debt, etc. etc. threads are all voted to the top on a daily basis... and right below it will be a disparaging joke about rape, race, transgendered people, or feminism. Yeah, jokes are jokes, but they come from a very real place, and whether people want to admit it or not, they can and do normalize offensive acts and behavior.\n\nTo the person below saying this is all anecdotal evidence of a vocal minority, I don't think it's that absurd to say you can make a fairly broad generalization about the beliefs of a majority of people on a website with millions of viewers based on the thousands of people that participate by upvoting or downvoting, or commenting in threads.\n\n\nAlso, maybe \"liberal\" was too politically-charged of a word to use in the title.

But the information contained in it would have served as an antidote to the kinds of comments made by low-information users, in essentially the only major thread on this current-event topic. \n\nI think—regardless of your personal views on the specific example—most of us on ToR can see that the forms of information that raise substantial interest also has the side effect of completely biasing the climate of discussion. If reddit's users and admins aspire for a better quality site—meaning better discussions, I find this one instance of one-sidedness and lack of diversity in viewpoints to be disturbing and foreboding. In this case, I'd say there wasn't even really another sub discussing the news (for example, from an academic perspective, given the context), and yet it's a front-page topic. This insularity is a problem.\n\n**update** I've been reading the variety of replies, and at this point there  a broad agreement of resignation, that basically there's nothing that can be done. There's some disagreement as to *why* reddit exhibits these social properties instead of the other intellectual habits - some attribute it to the user base (one comment astutely reminding the need for educational reform), others say it's the reddit platform system (e.g., allowing downvotes). But on that very thought, it occurs to me maybe there is some feedback between the two aspects; maybe the structure of this communications medium influences certain intellectual or cognitive behaviors such that users do not care to seek change in how they use this software. That's just a weird thought I'm having now. In the social sciences, groupthink and polarization have been understood as something that is not good for the health of a community. Maybe reddit even has an ethical obligation to address this. Just my current thoughts - which are subject to change!",

You can judge me for that if you want, it's a vice like anything else.\n\nThe sub hasn't changed much over the last few months, Bernie Sanders still runs the sub, about 35% of the top posts from the past week have been Pro-Bernie.  Over 40% were attacks on the GOP, an assortment of general attacks against the party, or specific jabs against candidates.  The other 15% were almost real politics, liberal bias sure, but they had some substance (anti-private prisons, pro-weed, low voter turnout etc.)\n\nNone of this is surprising, the surprising thing was what was missing.  Donald Trump.  In the last week, out of the top 50 posts, only 1 was about Trump, and it was 6 days ago, meaning we've gone 5 consecutive days without an anti-Trump post garnishing over 1,000 upvotes.  A few weeks ago, the front page was dominated by Trump.\n\nNow I want to open this up for discussion.  But I see two general groups of thought about this:\n\n1. People are bored of him/Don't want to give him publicity:\nThis could be true, but I don't think the good people at /r/politics really care, they love their click bait and are very short sighted about it.\n\n2. People kind of like Trump:\nThis one might have more merit, it's a little scary, but I think Trump has a little reddit flair, once you get over all the terrible things about him, he actually has a little of the Ron Paul/Bernie Sanders/Anti-Establishment vibe.\n\nOk, that should get the ball rolling, happy to hear your thoughts",

        "text": "I've been thinking about posting my experiences here for awhile, but thanks to the [recent /r/tumblrinaction mod drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3qjsga/what_i_learned_from_my_time_at_tia/) I felt like now's a pretty relevant time. Also I'm feeling sick so I'm basically just sitting here waiting to give candy to trick-or-treaters :( \n\n---  \n\n# Background\n\nI'm sure everyone here has at least heard of the cringe subreddits: /r/cringe and /r/cringepics. But I'll give a little backstory anyways for those of you who've never really been there. When /u/drumcowski founded /r/cringe (technically, the sub already existed but it was inactive), he wanted the subreddit to have a community that empathized with people in embarrassing situations. The community grew really quickly as it filled a very popular niche that was waiting to be filled. Over time, image posts began filling the subreddit due to the nature of reddit's voting algorithm (as I'm sure regulars in this sub are quite familiar with), so he made the controversial decision to ban image posts from /r/cringe and created /r/cringepics.  \n\nI was added as a mod a few weeks after to help deal with the growing community (I was one of the few who agreed with the decision, was active, and generally shared the same philosophy for the sub as the rest of the mod team at the time). I don't remember when exactly the shift happened, but eventually the cringe subreddits started becoming *really* mean-spirited. There was a period of time where we were getting several highly upvoted meta threads by regulars telling people to knock it off and stop bullying people. It was clear that there was a growing rift in the community, with the original regulars upset at the mean-spirited nature of the sub and the new users who basically think bullying is a necessary thing to shame people for \"being weird.\"\n\nEventually, the bullying crowd seemed to win out, and these meta posts started coming in far less often. We were noticing that the general perception of the two subs started to change as well - people were frequently disgusted by the behavior exhibited in the cringe subs. The cringe subs used to top people's lists of \"worst subs\" in those weekly /r/askreddit threads, for instance. I would say this was true for most of 2013 and about half of 2014. The cringe subs basically became non-stop mockery of bronies, furries, neckbeards, kids being edgy/weird, etc.\n\nThe very idea of \"cringe\" (an entirely subjective term) was, in our eyes, becoming corrupted. Rather than empathizing with someone in an awkward or embarrassing situation, the term was being used to mock people acting like \"degenerates\" (in the 'chan use of the term). You would often see someone say something stupid on a default sub, and another person would reply \"/r/cringe\" as if it was supposed to be relevant content.\n\n---  \n\n# Initial Mod Response\n\nHow did the mods feel about this? We hated it. A lot of us looked down on the bullies and tended to [pull pranks on them](https://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1bm139/my_april_fools_pranks_are_magic/) to try and make them GTFO. We would keep adding more and more mods to help moderate comment sections to remove the worst of the worst, but not a lot of people would volunteer due to how unpopular it was and how easy it was to get burned out. We did find a few people who thought they could help change the sub, but after a while it was all the same: we all just stopped caring because we didn't feel like there was anything that could be done.\n\nWe kept adding more and more rules to continuously target more and more extreme cases. Eg. \"no 4 panels\", \"no facebook memes\", \"no music videos\" hoping that this would help cut down on the negativity. It helped, a little, but the sub was still a huge embarrassment. The top mods would rather focus on the quickly growing /r/showerthoughts and forget that the cringe subs ever existed. We even tried to rationalize it by saying things like \"if we killed the sub, it would just come back far larger and far nastier due to the backlash, and if those subs had mods who condoned that behavior it could get seriously bad.\" Basically, the cringe subs had unintentionally become \"containment\" subs.\n\nContainment subs are total bullshit though - they just don't work. People were so outraged by the things being posted, even though we required all personally identifiable information to be scrubbed, that large groups of people would still somehow find the source and tell them off. Imagine the worst of /r/fatpeoplehate before FPH rose to prominence.\n\nI thought about quitting a few times, it just didn't seem worth staying as a mod of a sub that was acting so vile. I would get a lot of (deserved) enraged comments on other subs about the state of the cringe subs even on unrelated posts. I guess the reason I stayed on for so long is that I was friends with the top mods on the sub, and none of us ever *really* gave up on the sub considering we were adding a new rule like every month (hoping that things would get better). It got to the point where we had like 18 rules listed in the sidebar!  \n\n---  \n\n# Examining the Problem\n\nMost of us were busy with school and other obligations to really devote any time to figuring out how to fix this mess. But I decided one day in the summer of 2014 to just sit down and think hard about what to do with the sub.  \n\nMy view of the main problem was this: fighting against the userbase to stamp out bullying was a waste of time. The problem was the userbase itself. We would wait for a person to make a really offensive comment before taking action, but another would quickly take their place. Over and over and over again, it was like playing whack a mole with bullies. And there was no end in sight -  the sub was still growing extremely quickly (for a time, /r/cringepics was in the top 20 fastest growing subs, beating out several defaults).  \n\n**My solution:** in order to change the culture of the sub, you have to take away what attracts them there in the first place. Nothing else will work. In the case of the cringe subs, we figured out the most common link between all of the posts we thought were bad - they almost always involved something being done by a single person. No social situation or interaction, just one person \"being weird.\" Oftentimes the person \"being weird\" is even enjoying themselves. So our solution was simple: mandate that every single post had to directly involve at least 2 people in some kind of interaction. This would instantly kill off most of the content that was popular at the time, and undoubtedly cause a shit-storm of controversy. \n\nOther subs currently face similar situations. /r/subredditdrama attempted to stop their sub from becoming /r/circlebroke-lite by having mods call out bad comments. It failed. /r/tumblrinaction is trying to make their sub less serious by moderating comments and submissions from people who take things too seriously. It will fail. You have to *completely* neuter the content that brings them in.* It seems simple, of course, but *how* you do it is extremely important. See, in all three of our cases (SRD, TiA, and the cringe subs), the mod team has a different vision for what the sub should be like but in all three cases, nothing is done for such a long time mostly because of the fear of a backlash. \n\nHow do you deal with the backlash? We especially feared the backlash from our subscribers as it could quickly turn into a reddit-wide shitstorm that would have spawned an alternative sub even worse than what we were currently in control of. So I came up with a way to prevent any shitstorm from occurring.  \n\n---  \n\n# How We Did It\n\nFirst step, as I mentioned above, is to clearly define a rule that would exclude the kind of content that attracts most of the problem users. Yes, it may seem arbitrary (and it probably is) and will likely be subjective, but if your mod team has a vision of what you want to see out of the sub then it should be possible to come up with *something.* \n\nNext, you need to set this rule as a new internal guideline to enforce, **do not make the rule official and do not reference this new guideline when removing threads.** Yes, I am basically saying you need to be less transparent here and that you need to basically use some more vague justification for removing threads. In our case, we simply removed most of those posts for being \"not cringe-worthy\" (something we had been doing for a long time previously, to be fair). What you're doing here is creating a front page of your sub that you think your sub should look like in the future. Go full Nazi, even if it means your sub will be almost barren. When we did this, we used to have 30+ posts in a single day. Afterwards, we would only leave up like 2-3 posts a day. The idea behind curating the front page of your sub this way is to train any new subscribers to associate the content you want to see with your subreddit, and to make any of the problem users who miss that sort of content to eventually unsubscribe and move on. You should do this for at least a month (which is what we did).\n\nAfter your transition period is over, then you'll want to announce the new rule. We took this as an opportunity to consolidate our rules from 18 down to 6-7. When we did it, our mod post was downvoted, but we didn't have any significant backlash. All we got were a few modmails about us \"killing the sub\", but most of the comments on the mod post were like \"this sub has been shit recently so I guess I'll unsubscribe anyways.\"  In addition, you should give your users an alternative in the form of a multi-reddit. I made a public multi-reddit full of subs with the kind of content that we were removing so people wouldn't focus on a particular alternative. \n\nAnd that's basically it. Just continue enforcing your new rules, add new mods who like the changes, and keep going. Eventually a different set of users start to populate the subreddit, and the old users will move on to their own sub. But because you avoided a huge public backlash, that sub never gained much visibility.  \n\n**How effective were we? Take a look at /r/cringeanarchy. Then compare that to /r/cringe and /r/cringepics today.** The top posts should show a *really* stark difference. The hate messages have largely stopped, and we even get supportive messages now thanking us for cleaning up the sub. I've seen an uptick of viewpoints that are a lot less judgmental about people's hobbies and appearance, and I've seen a lot more progressive views as well. We're considered one of the subs \"taken over by SRS\" now (despite the fact that the top mods here have been the same for years) so make of that what you will.\n\n---  \n\n# Downsides\n\nOf course there are some downsides. Looking at the current situation of the cringe subs, I can list a few:\n\n* Because there was never any huge drama from the rule changes, most of the people who left the sub in distaste, or hate the sub due to its bad reputation don't know that things have changed. Even worse, they'll continue believing the sub is the same as it has always been, and continue spreading that idea when the sub comes up.\n\n    * Over time, though, this should slow down as people catch on. I've seen a lot of people bring up the sub's name and mention how they've changed for the better.\n\n* Even though you've changed things, you can't control how people essentially advertise your sub. Today, I still see people mention \"/r/cringe\" whenever someone does something dumb as if it's supposed to belong on the sub.\n\n* The sub's competitor will grow, and there's nothing you can do about it. /r/cringeanarchy is vile and its mods are supportive of it (check out their sidebar).  \n\n    * They aren't anywhere near as large as the original cringe subs, though. And there's a very real chance, given what happened to /r/fatpeoplehate, they might be banned if they continue the way they are.  \n\n* Your growth will suffer. Looking at the traffic stats for the cringe subs, it's easy to tell that there was a dip in traffic after we implemented the rules. Your monthly uniques and subscriber growth rate will slow down, but will eventually pick back up. Today, the cringe subs are still able to get multiple posts to /r/all, and have grown significantly in terms of the number of subscribers. Sure we're not as big as we could be, but it's a worthwhile tradeoff.\n\n* The problem doesn't entirely go away. Bullying people is still an issue, but it's not a different beast. We get comments disparaging people's behavior that sometimes go too far - eg. calling people autistic virgin losers and making fun of forever-alone neckbeards. With some Automod and active mods, though, the problem is much easier to control.  \n\n---  \n\nI think I've written enough here, but I would love to hear your thoughts!  \n\nedit: inb4 this thread gets linked to /r/subredditcancer\n\n",

        "text": "The [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3qjsga/what_i_learned_from_my_time_at_tia/) about a mod's resignation from /r/TumblrInAction drew me to this subreddit. \n\nI've been thinking about some of the issues raised in that post for a while, and it's cool to see there is a community discussing it. Hopefully this post won't violate any taboos in this subreddit's narrative and cause a contentious discussion or be downvoted.\n\nPerhaps you don't think this subreddit has a narrative; but I'm increasingly convinced that every subreddit has a narrative. At first this is defined by the founders of the subreddit and the initial mods, but as the subreddit grows in subscribers and traffic they are only able to retain so much control over it as it evolves.\n\nSubreddits are communities, which need a level of social harmony in order to function. As has been seen from studies on [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink), this 'desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional descision-making outcome.'\n\nThis means even participants who are trying to act rationally and without bias (those noble few) can be misled by their psychology. \n\nOne thing I'm interested in is in whether the narrative can be countered. As was pointed out in the TiA post, there's generally a small group of people writing most of the comments, especially in non-default subs, and sometimes an early comment that counters the narrative can get significant upvotes.\n\nMostly though I think people give up and fracture off into their own new communities. On the surface it may seem like this is about the mods being jerks, but I think unhappiness with mods is often just a manifestation of a subgroup within the community disliking aspects of the prevailing narrative. \n\nIt's also interesting to see narratives between separate communities collide, which can lead to 'brigading' between subreddits with ideological conflicts.\n\nThere seems to be social science research on these issues, e.g. [this paper](http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/5/2/163.abstract):\n\n&gt; Abstract: In two experiments, participants evaluated other individuals who deviated in either an anti-or pro-normative direction relative to normative members of the same group. We predicted that individuals would prefer group members who contributed to the validity of in-group norms. In Study 1, anti-norm deviants in an organization attracted more negative evaluations than did pro-norm deviants, even though both were dissimilar to the in-group prototype. Consistent with our model of ‘subjective group dynamics’, evaluations of such deviants were related to perceivers’ identification with their own group. In Study 2, British and Overseas students were more positive toward in-group and out-group members who deviated in the in-group normative direction with respect to university policies for Overseas students. These findings complement the results from laboratory experiments by Abrams, Marques, Bown, and Henson (2000). Reactions to deviance reflect more than just the magnitude of deviance; they are also affected by the group membership of the deviant, and the direction in which that person deviates.\n\nWould love to hear anyone's thoughts on these matters!",

Usually it's an effort to combat behaviour that the moderators would rather not have, like downvoting for disagreeing or posting low effort comments.\n\n   &amp;nbsp;\n\nIt's not really clear how effective this is to me. For one, the majority of Reddit users are mobile these days, which means they won't notice anything at all. Then there's also a large portion of users that have disabled stylesheets entirely because they don't appreciate the difference between subreddits it brings. \n\n   &amp;nbsp;\n\nDepending on the subreddit though, I'm sure there's still a sizeable amount of users who actively see the subreddit's theme. I'm wondering if it's reasonable to assume that a subreddit theme *can* influence behaviour like that. \n\n   &amp;nbsp;\n\nI made /r/Naut, which is the most used subreddit theme out there. So if it were the case that stylesheets can influence behaviour significantly, I'm in a position to add something that a fair amount of Reddit's desktop users will start seeing. \n\n   &amp;nbsp;\n\n**Do you think it's possible to influence users in this way? And if you do, what would be some useful additions to add, that could combat some of the negative behaviour users show?**\n\n   &amp;nbsp;\n\nI really enjoy discussions here, so I'm curious to hear what you think!",

It is, in my experience, as fundamental as Murphy's Law or Hanlon's Razor.\n\n&gt; Once you get big enough, it becomes impossible to hold a nuanced debate. There are too many variances of opinions to consider, the upvotes and downvotes flow too freely, and there's no space in the comment section to consider opinions opposing your own.\n\n&gt; Instead, the people who rise to the top are those who are are clearest, and most certain. And those people are usually on the ends of any given spectrum. They're extremists. They're clear, because their opinions are black and white, and they're utterly without nuance. And they're certain, because their opinions are black and white, and they're utterly without nuance.\n\nI'm sure we all intuitively understand this phenomenon, and I strongly lament it.\n\nSo I thought of something. I'm sure this isn't a new idea, but a visual form of it came into my head that is maybe worth playing with.\n\nWhat if there were *two axes* for voting on a submission or comment?\n\nThink a gaming controller [directional pad](http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dpadt.png).\n\nUp and Down could be relinquished as the \"agree\" and \"disagree\" buttons, as they are already used today.\n\nAnd perhaps Left and Right could be the original Reddit voting intent of \"promotes discussion\" and \"discourages discussion\".\n\nI estimate that the former pair would be used far more often, but the latter group could be a kind of secondary system for people who wanted to use Reddit not to have their ideas confirmed, but to engage with topics and people.\n\nThe only reason that Reddiquette constantly being violated it a problem is because the default algorithms for displaying comments on submissions uses upvote measure.\n\nWhat if there were prominently-placed, equally-valued sorting methods for highly \"Left-voted\" or \"Right-voted\" submissions and comments? (...Whichever is \"good\", meaning promoting discussion.)\n\nAnother method of instituting this could be without two voting options, rather just one button indicating that the content promotes discussion. Perhaps in-between the upvote/downvote arrows.\n\nOther comment sorting methods exist, to be sure, but I don't use them much. Maybe I'm missing out on a feature that actually works, but in my limited experience with it, picking out the comments that hover around zero because of agreement/disagreement balance doesn't always mean it's worth seeing.\n\nI'll also point out that no matter how this feature would be engineered, even if the \"middle button\" had **NUANCE** in big, bold letters, it would be subject to the whims of thousands as to how it would truly be used, just like we see with upvotes and downvotes.\n\nSo, what do y'all think? Are there good links to folks that have already taken this topic and run with it?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3qjsga/what_i_learned_from_my_time_at_tia/",
        "text": "The following is a copy of my [resignation from modding the TiA network](https://www.reddit.com/r/TiADiscussion/comments/3qf05u/a_resignation_and_what_i_learned/), in which I chose to write out what I'd learnt more generally about Reddit during my time there. Perhaps it may seem a bit melodramatic, here, to those who aren't familiar with the sub itself, but people suggested that the more theoretical bits might be appreciated.\n\n____\n\n&gt;This post is my resignation from moderating /r/TumblrInAction, along with her sister subs. This is, however, the least important thing it is.\n\n#\n\n&gt;I won't beat around the bush; TiA has gone to shit, in my eyes. Now, it's worse than it has ever been. The posts have been degrading steadily for over a year. The users grow ever more like mirror images of that which we used to laugh at. And the mod team, which I always found to be an example of modding done right (even when I wasn't on it), is fractured and in disarray. The team is likely never to fully recover.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Instead of simply bemoaning what has come to pass, however, I ask myself the question:\n\n#\n\n&gt;#**What have I learnt?**\n\n&gt;____\n\n&gt;By and large, the most important lessons from my time with TiA boil down to three key points.\n\n#\n\n&gt;#1. Individuals matter.\n\n&gt;This sounds sappy and feel-good. It isn't.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Back when I joined, TiA had just hit 40K subscribers. It was a very different place; it was a vector for jovial amusement and light mockery, where today it feels a lot more about hatred and derision. So, what gave it that flavour? What made it seem more upbeat? Were all 40K subs a fundamentally different sort of person, in some way?\n\n#\n\n&gt;No. The reason that is seemed different is because, fundamentally, the vast, vast bulk of users simply ***do not matter.*** Yup, I'm serious. The old rule of thumb, which you'll hear quite often, is that 10% of users vote, and 1% actually post or comment. People don't tend to grasp the implications of this, however. The key factor is that that 1% is usually *the same people* for almost every post.\n\n#\n\n&gt;This is how you get what are sometimes referred to as 'flavour posters'. These are the people who are in the new queue. They're the people posting content. And they're the people in *every* comment section.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Flavour posters define the entire narrative of a sub. Flavour posters are generally the *only* people who matter in a small to medium sized sub. **And, as a 40K subreddit, TiA had maybe 10 of them.** At the time I could recognise all of their usernames.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Back then, I was a flavour poster. I'd check TiA twice a day, and comment on almost every post. Then, I realised that, if I got to a post fast enough, I could essentially control the narrative for that post. So long as I got there first or second, and was vaguely convincing, I could single-handedly sway the general opinion of a 1,000 person comment section. This was true when I was commenting *with* the prevailing circlejerk, but it was also true when I decided to *defend* the subject of the post, to go *against* the circlejerk.\n\n#\n\n&gt;In other words, almost nobody else actually matters. At low to medium subscriber counts, the flavour posters define a subreddit, and any other commenters will usually fall into line with them. This can be good, this can be bad; TiA had an absolutely *great* set of flavour posters in its heyday. In the end, though, that dependency brings me to my second point.\n\n#\n\n&gt;#2. Big subs go to shit.\n\n&gt;There is a point, usually somewhere between 50K and 100K subscribers, at which point a sub will go 'bad'. Now, 'bad' isn't always *very* bad, although in TiA's case I'd argue it is, but it's always noticeably worse than before. The quality of posts will decline, becoming less clever or interesting or funny, and will slowly gravitate toward lowest-common-denominator shit. The quality of comments also plummets, as staler and more overused jokes and memes are used, as genuine insight becomes rarer and less visible, and as opinions counter to the circlejerk start to be downvoted more and more heavily. I remember a time when one could have a genuine discussion on TiA, with people that the sub generally disagreed with, and they'd be asked interesting questions rather than mindlessly downvoted. Now, well, it's default-level toxicity on a good day, and it started heading there when it hit roughly 70K subs.\n\n#\n\n&gt;So, why is this? I don't think there's any single answer, it seems to be an unfortunate convergence of trends, which cannot be negated by any sub less pure and selected than something like /r/AskHistorians. It seems to be unavoidable for any normal sub.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Partly, it's baked into the nature of the voting mechanics. At bigger sub sizes, unpopular opinions don't get that little bit of extra breathing time to justify themselves. Instead, the votes come in just too fast; circlejerks rise to the top *immediately*, while different ideas either get downvoted or simply ignored, languishing at the bottom of the comment section.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Partly, it comes back to that old quote: *\"Any community that gets its laughs by pretending to be idiots will eventually be flooded by actual idiots who mistakenly believe they are in good company.\"* This is true of idiocy, but also of anything else. In TiA, we were essentially pretending to be a softcore hate group, but in a jokey, non-serious way. Past about 70K, however, newcomers stopped understanding that. They failed to integrate, and overran the originals. Instead of as a joke, they saw these tumblrinas as someone to hate. They became a mirror image, in many ways, of what they mocked.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Partly, in TiA's case, I've seen it suggested that it was as a result of a shift in our subject matter, Tumblr. The Tumblr zeitgheist moved away from silly otherkin blogs and fanfiction, and got more vitriolic and political. Instead of a zoo, to laugh at the monkeys flinging shit, TiA shifted with it to become a focus for all those who really hated the ideas espoused by the Tumblr community. Personally, I'm not sure that this makes me dislike the result any less. When I agreed to moderate TiA, I signed on to be a zookeper, not to be military police.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Partly, it comes back to the flavour users. After a certain point, the aforementioned factors (and others) will start to drive those original tastemakers out. They start to say 'fuck it', and leave. Usually, they will eventually be replaced, but the new flavour posters will have different ideas, they'll be less likely to disagree with popular opinion. The quality of the comments will degrade, as the original viewpoints wink out.\n\n#\n\n&gt;There's a million other factors, each applied differently to every sub that goes through this transition. Some get hit worse than others. In my opinion, TiA didn't really survive at all, instead it morphed into something rather nasty. Which leads me to my final point.\n\n#\n\n&gt;#3. The internet tends towards extremism.\n\n&gt;If you remember anything from this post, remember this axiom. It is, in my experience, as fundamental as Murphy's Law or Hanlon's Razor.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Once you get big enough, it becomes impossible to hold a nuanced debate. There are too many variances of opinions to consider, the upvotes and downvotes flow too freely, and there's no space in the comment section to consider opinions opposing your own.\n\n#\n\n&gt;Instead, the people who rise to the top are those who are are clearest, and most certain. And those people are usually on the ends of any given spectrum. They're extremists. They're clear, because their opinions are black and white, and they're utterly without nuance. And they're certain, because their opinions are black and white, and they're utterly without nuance.\n\n#\n\n&gt;And, once these opinions have risen to the top, they stay there. The problem is that your average, normal, well adjusted person isn't certain that they're right all the time. Often, they're not *completely* sure what their opinion is at all. They're ready to be persuaded. And so, even though there's usually far more sensible, nuanced commenters out there, they become a silent majority. They see the black-and-white, upvoted post, then assume that, because it's been upvoted and seems certain, it must be right, and then never put forward their more sensible take.\n\n#\n\n&gt;But, on the internet, the silent majority is invisible. You've no idea how many normal, sensible opinions there are out there, as you can only see this really extreme one, which is highly upvoted. But, if nobody's saying it's too extreme, and it's highly upvoted, then surely it's right? So you decide that it is now *your* opinion, too. And then you upvote, and move on.\n\n#\n\n&gt;And once you've reached this point, the rest all becomes horribly standard. With an extremist viewpoint comes an us-vs-them mentality. Then that becomes a refusal to listen to *them*. And then you end up with what Yahtzee Croshaw described as \"a dual siege between two heavily-entrenched echo chambers of vocal minorities, separated by a vast landscape of howler monkeys flinging shit.\"\n\n#\n\n&gt;And that is what's universal, across the internet. The upvote mechanics might be different, but certainty stands out, and the silent majority remains invisible. And the result is extremism. That can be as an SJW, or, in TiA's case, as people who hate SJWs. It *will* be the two ends of any given spectrum.\n\n&gt;____\n\n&gt;So, there you have it, the three key learnings that I will be taking from my time with TiA. I shall always remember TiA at its best, but I can no longer put up with its current worst.\n\n&gt;Goodbye.\n\n____\n\nAnyway, perhaps some of you may find some of this interesting. I hope so!",

I'd argue that it's a combination of both. A lack self awareness, or perhaps naivete, on the part of redditors who are perhaps newer to the metasphere and have not had the chance to look at the overall picture, but instead hop on to the bandwagon because being anti-SRS seems to be quite popular among redditors. Perhaps hypocrisy on those more attuned to the metasphere. It takes a certain type of person to be able to admit their hypocrisies, and for most of us, it only seems natural to double down when confronted with ours. Perhaps there's even an insidious aspect to it, especially on the part of those such as Warlizard, who are so well attuned to reddit, that they must have predicted that latching on to such a popular opinion would result in a massive amount of karma.\n\nI'd really love to hear ToR's thoughts on this.",

Looking in on those subs as a professional developer myself, a whole lot of the highly-upvoted content would leave me needing to ask followup questions to understand what the user actually wanted (but miserably failed) to say. I'd hate to have to actually deal with those subs as part of my day job. I thought Linux distro bug trackers were bad; wow, they're a utopia compared to these subs! The toxicity of submissions and reactions to submissions in these subs has pushed me away from contributing in any meaningful, direct way to a site I obviously enjoy and spend a lot of time on, and I find this to be a real barrier to contribution that other capable developers likely experience as well (to say nothing of nontechnical people who aren't used to this kind of thing!).\n\nWhat causes the content and votes in those subs to be so different from what I'd expect? I can't figure it out and I'd love some additional input.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3pnaf3/should_rmusic_ban_music/",
        "text": "Recently, the /r/music team has been exploring extreme measures to improve quality and freshness of content including banning direct links to streaming music entirely. I wanted to generate some discussion and solicit feedback here before posing the idea to the masses and implementing it if we decide to even go that route. \n\n# Why?\n\nOne of our biggest issues and causes for complaint has been stale, regurgitated content, and the community has reached a certain level of toxicity as a result. About 18 months ago, we instituted [a Hall of Fame list to address the most reposted artists and songs](https://www.reddit.com/r/music/wiki/halloffame) and expanded it a year later with new additions. We also implemented [an automated repost filter that prevents an artist from being submitted for 30 days after it has a post breaking 100 points](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/wiki/removalreasons#wiki_reason_.23_4_-_artist_repost_before_end_of_30_day_cooldown_period). While these efforts have somewhat mitigated repetitive content, the overarching issue remains fairly pervasive. \n\nAs it stands, [the only streaming music that makes the front page has overwhelming name recognition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/search?sort=top&amp;amp;amp;q=flair%3Amusic%2Bstreaming&amp;amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;amp;t=month) - we could continually make new additions to the Hall of Fame list and make our repost filter more stringent, but this doesn't address [the large number of streaming music posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/search?sort=new&amp;amp;amp;q=flair%3Amusic%2Bstreaming&amp;amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;amp;t=month) that go unseen, get downvoted to zero, and crowd out more meaningful content in /new. \n\nWhen I began drafting this, 31 of the top 50 posts on our front page were streaming links. Even if a link does front page, it rarely yields a worthwhile comment section and garners so many votes due to mere name recognition, not because users put in the effort to listen before voting. So these posts are \"low-effort\" both in terms of time required to submit and time required to cast a vote - [more on that phenomenon here](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/wiki/siteideas#wiki_upvote_velocity_of_an_unladen_swallow). I haven't even mentioned the fact that most comment sections for front page music links are riddled with complaints anyway. \n\n# What would this achieve? \n\nHere are the goals we have in mind:\n\n* Reduce overcrowding of /new and give more attention to higher quality and in-depth posts. No direct links to Youtube, Soundcloud, Bandcamp, etc. would be accepted. By eliminating approximately 60% of what populates /r/music, we open up the spotlight to better posts and provide more opportunities for musicians to submit their work honestly. \n\n* Completely rid the sub of links to artists and songs that are posted way too much and avoid the tedium of making new Hall of Fame additions and adjusting our repost filter. \n\n* To self-promote, users would have to do more than simply spam links. We would require significant background, discussion, etc. for your post to go through, and it would likely have a better chance at being seen without having to compete with /r/music's most popular bands and the slew of other posts, which is part of what we hope to achieve. Users submitting their own work and playing by our rules should have a platform for doing so that isn't overshadowed by the weekly Dave Grohl post. \n\n* Breakout [playlisting-style and recommendation posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/3pke62/whats_a_great_classic_rock_song_that_most_people/) separately (i.e. different flair, rules, etc.) from discussion posts and create a regular Automod stickied thread specifically for users who simply want to share music links. \n\n* Reduce the enormous amount of anonymous downvoting that occurs in /new. A lot of this is attributable to the disdain many have for the community, but a portion definitely comes from submitters who want their post to beat out the rest. By removing the ability to submit music as a link post, we eliminate some of the unnecessary competition going on between submissions. \n\n# What issues would arise?\n\nThese are some of the counterpoints presented during our discussions:\n\n* Users almost certainly will not understand the point of this rule change - all they'll hear is \"You can't post music to /r/music\". This could result in endless blowback and ridicule due to the irony. \n\n* Where would the average user (who doesn't know of the wide variety of music subs and is not well-versed in how the site works) go to submit streaming links? Similarly, where do users go if all they want is to listen? Should we give consideration to the users who look at /new and actually listen to posts? Making a weekly or daily stickied thread to host them may not be sufficient even if supplemented with frequent playlisting threads. Educating users on the new rule and how it works could be more effort than it's worth.\n\n* The potential for users circumventing the rule and posting links in text posts anyway. We currently dedicate Fridays to text posts to generate more discussion, and this is already a problem despite our automated filters in place to prevent it. \n\n* This option is way too extreme, and we should find a middle ground or not do it at all. One suggestion was to try expanding text post Friday to a full week and see how it goes, but that doesn't address the current failures we have with Fridays (e.g. posts that barely qualify as \"discussion\", users spamming links with just enough verbiage to beat the filter, thinly veiled discussion that is actually playlisting, etc.). Supplemental changes would need to be made for a trial run like that to yield valid results. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs I said at the beginning, we've been kicking around this idea a bit and are nowhere near actual implementation. I'd appreciate any kind of feedback folks can provide - unintended consequences, potential benefits we didn't include, and other ways to ensure such a massive change runs smoothly. We'll need to do more than flip a switch and hope it works especially with the expected level of opposition. I think framing the change correctly to users will be huge for making sure it's well received.",
