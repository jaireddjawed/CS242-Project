While it is true that fat contains more calories per gram than carbohydrates and protein, eating fat does not directly cause weight gain. In fact, certain types of fats, such as unsaturated fats, can be part of a healthy diet and are important for heart health.*\n\n*Another common nutrition myth is that carbohydrates are bad for you. This is also not true. Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for the body and are found in many healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.*\n\n*It's also a myth that all processed foods are unhealthy. Some processed foods, such as canned fruits and vegetables, can be a convenient and nutritious part of a balanced diet. However, it's important to be mindful of the amount and type of processing that foods undergo and to limit those that are high in added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.*\n\n*It's important to base your nutrition choices on scientific evidence and to be skeptical of diets or eating patterns that are not supported by credible research. A balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods and minimizes processed foods and added sugars is typically the best approach for overall health and wellness.*‚Äù\n\n\\[1\\] [Gil Carvalho asked ChatGPT a question about nutrition and posted its response on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NutritionMadeS3/status/1624853956613529603)",

I'm pretty busy between work and parenting so I need help with meals that are healthy and will last for longer than a couple of days. Which also won't break the bank.\nAny suggestions, links, recipes, would be greatly appreciated. My goal is to lose weight and stay healthy, getting all the right nutrients to keep everything strong and healthy.",
