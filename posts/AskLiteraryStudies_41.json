To which she answered in the negative. Upon this the other replied, with a smile, That the parish was very much obliged to her for having turned Jenny away as she did.\n\n&gt;Mrs Partridge, whose jealousy, as the reader well knows, was long since cured, and who had no other quarrel to her maid, answered boldly, She did not know any obligation the parish had to her on that account; for she believed Jenny had scarce left her **equal** behind her.\n\nWhat does \"Equal\" here mean? In my copy, The E is capitalized. Fielding capitalizes the first letter of almost every noun, so \"Equal\" is probably a noun.\n\nMore context: Mrs. Partridge's husband had been teaching their maid Latin and Mrs. Patridge got jealous, thinking that he and the maid were having an affair. She chased the maid out of the house and fired her. Mrs. Partridge forgave her husband because he said that he wanted to fire the maid too, but then Mrs. Partridge talks to some gossips who say (after the quoted passage) that Jenny just gave birth to two bastards.\n\nHere's the whole chapter :\n\nhttp://fielding.thefreelibrary.com/The-History-of-Tom-Jones-a-Foundling/2-4\n\nWho/what is the \"Equal\"?",

I say this with neutral feelings, if it is actually a trend; I've read some deeply interesting and affecting contemporary stuff, and other novels which were... less so.

Too unfocused? Second, which discipline would work best for pursuing this topic?

Are there any good or definitive reference texts that deal with the archetype of the macho man or the roles of men in literature in general? Like, the male as the passionate warrior/achiever, Casanova/lover, father figure, etc.?\n\nEDIT: clarification on some stuff I missed out\n\n&gt; Sorry, I should have mentioned. It's a high-school level 3k-word essay, but a bit more advanced (so like AP, I guess?), regarding how \"traditional male heroes\" or protagonists strongly exhibiting classic masculine traits 1) are portrayed in the 3 texts, 2) how these traits end up at odds with society/their other personal duties and issues, and 3) how it leads to self-destruction. The three texts are Miller's A View From the Bridge, Things Fall Apart and J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace.\n\n&gt; I already have the structure of the whole thing out, but I'm having trouble actually beginning to write an introduction where I define/clarify what I mean. Secondary sources should be consulted according to the requirements, and that's where I'm having problems as I'm not the most well-read in literary criticism and whatnot.\n\n&gt; So far, the definition's been pretty straightforward: traditional masculinity requires the man to be passionate in love and war - he is virile and good with women, and also can fight his way out of anything. Solves problems with violence. A sense of honour. Rejection of the unmanly/feminine. Stoic to a fault, as an extension of this rejection. With these traits, the man is expected to fulfill roles of the warrior (prove to others his achievements and manliness), father (protect the family) and lover (as a husband or a Casanova).\n\n&gt; Main difficulty: going beyond simply stating \"the traditional male hero tends to be ___ and ___\" and providing cite-able evidence that heroes like James Bond or the men of Hemingway do indeed fit the archetype, and are the basis of my (probably limited) definition. In other words, the definition's definitely out there, and all these traits come to mind when machismo and expectations of men are brought up, it's just a problem because I don't think I can simply state it like that without backup.",

I think what fascinates me is the kind of undefined moral territory that the characters in the shows that are/have been popular within the last 25 years (using *Twin Peaks* as a starting point) inhabit. Tony Soprano, McNulty and Omar, Don Draper and friends, Walter White, Bill Henrickson, both of David Duchovny's most popular characters. All of these characters are the protagonists of these shows, but their ethics are not always in line with a normal sense of right and wrong. Television seems to be the era of the antihero.\n\nSo, pithy attempts at popular culture writing aside, I have a few more questions:\n\n1. The term: what book/author started using \"antihero\" in a critical sense. The *OED* Isn't really elucidating this much for me. Google's answer isn't convincing me completely either:\n\n        an·ti·he·ro\n        ˈantēˌhi(ə)rō,ˈantī-/Submit\n        noun\n        noun: anti-hero; plural noun: anti-heroes; noun: antihero; plural noun: antiheroes\n        a central character in a story, movie, or drama who lacks conventional heroic attributes\n\n2. In your opinion, where, in American literature/culture, do you see this type of character first? Examples from novels, drama, and early television would be great. Nabokov's Humbert Humbert and Díaz's Yunior come to mind, but I don't have a strict working set of criteria.\n\n3. Where would I start reading on this path? I don't quite know what I have to say about this that's unique yet, but it fascinates me enough to be a guiding factor in my thesis. I'm starting my MA this year, so I'm trying to gestate ideas sooner than later.\n\n4. Any other points you'd like to make would be great.\n\nThanks again, and I look forward to compiling some material for reading, and possibly some discussion. I'm kind of perusing some terms lists right now, but I figured that I'd get a better answer here.",

Is it tough? Is it mainly books or a mixture of prose and poetry? \n\nWas it \"easy\" or \"difficult\" for you? Why or why not? \n\nI ask this because I have a very strong passion for literature, but I actually plan on becoming a doctor. Which means lots of science and math to take care of during undergrad as well. I just want to see if majoring in literature is doable along with a difficult pre-medical background, or if a lit major is better off doing lit only, or even if a minor or self study is best. \nAny help is appreciated!

TV, video games, books, movies, etc. I used to think this was just killing time, but I have decided that the experience of story telling or narrative is of value to me. I've been curious for a while about having a better understanding of the mechanics or theory behind story telling. I've heard of book that explain the idea of the \"hero\" and I've heard how someone has concluded that all stories fall into some small number of categories. Maybe seven of them. I don't remember. I get a kick out of http://tvtropes.org. Backgroundwise, I'm a 31 y/o software engineer with only some high school English classes that might come to bear. My hope would be that a bit of an informal study, maybe a couple books or documentaries would enrich my experiences further. My fear is that looking behind the curtain might spoil some of the magic. Seeing how the sausage is made and all that.\nI suspect this varies quite a bit from person to person, so it's anybody's guess what's right for me. So, does anyone have any experience with the study of story, narrative, plot, heroes, characters, etc? Any recommendations for great entry level but intelligent sources of information?",

        "text": "Greetings and salutations, my dear literary scholars and and soon-to-be ones! I am looking for information/advice on the movements/approaches mentioned in the title. \n\nFistly, I would like to point out that I am not (even aspiring to be) a literary scholar of any sorts. Advanced literary theory is a whole nother world for me. Also mind you that, even though this post obviously serves a specific purpose, I am not looking for a complete summary or analysis of this approach, but I rather hope you would point me in the right direction.\n\nMy first question would be, is this even a topic worth discussing? If yes, let's continue. \n\nSo, time to dive into it. I know *New Criticism* in the States is based on the French formalist method of literary analysis mentioned in the title. I understand the gist of the approach (we look at the text, ignore the author and the reader's response). And that's just about it. Other than the Wikipedia entries (the one on *New Critism* is the only lengthy one), I am quite stumped. My first inquiries would be:\n\n* These methods/movements seems to be discussed separately when they are so clearly very similar. Why? Or are they?\n* I have yet to find any solid sources on *Explication de Texte*. When did it start? Exactly how much did it influence *New Criticism*? When reading about the primary advocate of method, Gustave Lanson, it seems he did not fully agree with the approach himself. This confuses me even further. \n* How does *close reading* fit into all of this? I figure, since France is the home of high style and controversial ideas/movements, *Explication de Texte* was definitely there first. \n* How does the notion art for art's sake fit into all of this? Something to do with not over-analysing and appreciating the beauty of the piece itself?\n* *Explication de Texte* is clearly a French method, yet *close reading* seems to be an Anglo-American thing. As far as I understand, they are basically the same thing, and some literary scholars seem to agree with that, others make a distinction, yet I have not found out what that could be, other than simply historical reasons.  \n* And finally, I realise *New Criticism* is a rather controversial method of analysis and, even in its prime, was often mocked. What does Reddit think of this approach?\n\nI do realise even this post in itself is rather raw. I am trying to understand the point of different approaches to literature. I value this method as a part of literary theory (one can only see the truest picture when every path has been taken), but by itself it seems kind of pointless. \n\nHow did the idea to analyse a text and nothing but the text come into being? Someone, somewhere (perhaps Gustave Lanson) suddenly decided that putting the text into context, analysing the time period and inner working of the author, is pointless. I once read something about Fitzgerald – how he was a social figure and a \"fun guy\" to be around, someone I'd like to go drinking with, yet he was a brilliant writer when he was being a writer, not an outgoing man. If that example is given, this method of analysis suddenly makes a *helluva* lot of sense. Could it be that some authors, depending on their habits, should be analyised from an *Explication de Texte* perspective? And if so, then we're already screwed because we are using *Explication de Texte* because we had a look at the author first. \n\nI hope I am not out of line with this kind of a post. Note that I am also looking for recommended reading. \n",

How am I able to \"relate\" to his poems a lot better than other work with 'non-traditional' grammar and structure? is it his repetition through out the poem? the way he capitalize certain words? what do you think?\n\n  \n\nthank!",

Is it best to pick a work, read all the scholarship on it, and construct a thesis around my response to more recent scholarship? Or would I be better served choosing a specific analytic framework (Freud, Foucault, etc.), choosing some specific aspect and relating that idea to the work?\n\n\nThe college I went to didn't have a strong grasp on my literary interests or the direction contemporary literary studies are headed so I'm a little lost.

I'm writing a paper currently on Freud's Family Romance and how it affects the development of Heroes like Superman, Batman, Harry Potter, and Max from Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are.\nTo be clear, I'm not seeking homework help, but I'd love to see discussion on this topic because right now I'm quite enthralled in the dynamic between parents and their children regarding literary heroes.\nAnyways, I have a few questions for you: Why does Harry Potter look at his parents more nobly than Snape? It seems as though Snape actually lived with Harry's father and knew firsthand how James was, but when Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised, he sees his parents as being perfect. It's fairly apparent that Harry looks on his parents as being better than anyone elses parents. Why do you think this is? What impact does Harry Potter's parents and his relationship with the Dursleys have on the appeal to Rowling's audience for Harry Potter? Also in what other works of literature is the relationship between dead parents and children idealized similarly to Harry Potter? In regard to Where the Wild Things Are how is Max's relationship with the Monsters or his created universe similar to Harry Potter's relationship with his parents?\nIf I had to ask one question to r/AskLiterature, it would be this: Why is the theme of idealizing parents so prevalent in children's literature, when according to Freud, this stage in their developmental life they are most likely to be seeing the flaws in their parents?",

The novel is split over two parts, the first is a detective story, and the second is a sort of \"prequel\" that describes how and why the suspect was driven to his crimes. While the first part of the book leads you to condemn the suspect, the second part makes you sympathize with him, and realize that crime is more complicated than just logic and deduction. In the end, the inspector decides to let the man go after having fully understood his motives. \n\nIt's a great instance of early \"detective\" novels (or I'd call them more aptly police novels, since the idea of the gumshoe hadn't really developed yet!) since you can see the slow move from urban bildungsroman to crime mystery. \n\nAnyway, feel free to submit either here or at AskHistorians... or both!

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/AskLiteraryStudies/comments/26fv5c/commentary_and_analysis_of_wind_by_ted_hughes/",
        "text": "I wrote a commentary on [Wind](http://www.poetseers.org/poets/ted-hughes-poetry/wind/) by Ted Hughes for a school assignment recently. Perhaps I got carried away in my interpretation, but I felt like the beautiful and nuanced choice of language in this poem was at odds with a standard \"nature is powerful\" interpretation. Here it is:\n\nWind By Ted Hughes is a metaphysical illustration of the powerfully sublime nature of the creative process. The opposing forces of singular inspiration and the transitory proliferations of inertia are contained at once in an extended metaphor –nature.  Personification of elements comprising natural landscape is employed to accentuate the pitiless necessity of destruction. True forces of renewal require the annihilation of the incompliant, the stagnant. In Wind, nature is self-overcoming, and suitably so, as such is the nature of creation; the individual is the first creation.\n\nA bypass metaphor is employed when Hughes writes “This house has been far our at sea all night”.  The house is symbolic of the secure and founded ego; the specification of “This house” connotes self. Having “been far out at sea all night” can be interpreted as a direct metaphor; however in the context of maritime isolation, it is perhaps more fitting to interpret an indirect likening of the house to a ship at sea. A ship at sea in the night is of course metaphorical for isolation, the definitive characteristic of the individual. \nIn the first stanza sound precedes force, effect is perceived but cause is unknown. We hear the “crashing” of the “woods” and the “booming hills” but we do not yet know the origin of such calamity, it is distant, intangible, and inexpressible. Such is characteristic of inspiration, creation, and reformation. Derivation is often sourced from the subconscious.  The nebular grounds of conception are visceral raw and primal, threatening of structure. This is metaphorically expressed through personification of “Winds stampeding the fields under the window”.  It is important to note that genesis is often self-contained. Once consumed, it can be very difficult to determine the process of instigation. There is only the wild struggle of the present, the violent overcoming of comfortable peace. Subsequently it is no surprise that the “Winds” are “floundering black astride and blinding wet”. What chance does apathetic impotence stand against the will to power?\n\nThe rising of the day correlates with the emergence of consciousness and lucidity. And so begins creation, with the upholding of insight and revaluation under new clarity. The union of lucidity and will builds powerful creative potential. This is illustrated when the “wind wielded blade-light”. The revaluation of existing structures occurs under a foreign, ominous force of sublimity, “luminous and emerald, flexing like a mad eye.” The green coloration is symbolic of vitality and creation.  Sublime forces of destruction drive all great creative renewal. “Noon” represents the height of the ego’s awareness, by which the self bears clear and direct witness to its reformation. The “brunt wind” of sublime creation is not merely palpable but holds an overwhelmingly, powerful, physical and intimate presence; “denting the balls of my[his] eyes”.\n\nNow begins deconstruction of transitory proliferations, pity is developed in personification but creation is above its pity and does not relent. The “fields” are “quivering” the “skyline” is “grimacing”. Nature, like the ego, overcomes itself. It destroys and reforms; the singularly powerful violently reinvigorates the stagnated proliferate. A “magpie” is “flung away”; a “gull” is “bent like an iron bar slowly.” The deconstructive simile illustrates the constructed nature of inertia and threatens, in its likeness, the fate of the house. Enjambment between “The house” and “Rang like some fine green goblet …” and between “in the note” and “That any second would shatter it”, further this affect.  The green (yet again) goblet simile serves as the climax of the poem, where potential reaches its peak. Singularity between creation and destruction is achieved, the ego is “Now deep” and experiences the full feeling of sublime; which according to Schopenhauer requires “Overpowering turbulent Nature” with the fullest feeling of sublime being “pleasure from knowledge of observer’s nothingness and oneness with Nature.”  This feeling of turbulence and fear is clearly present in the enjambment between “we grip” and “Our hearts and cannot entertain book, thought”.  The enjambment preceding “Or each other” and the following caesura serve to emphasize the isolation of the experience.  \n\nThe symbolic purpose of the fire is especially imperative. Yet another manifestation of vitality within destruction, it offers a meditative mode of reflection for the vast chaotic elements outside the house. The reversion of consciousness to the eternally preserving core is not only powerfully consolidative; the nature of its object parallels and affirms the very forces, by which it was accomplished. Man’s perception may not allow him to comprehend the terrifying and beautiful power of Nature, but he may learn to accept and love both its creative overcoming and recognize it within himself. This is what is meant when “We watch the fire blazing, and feel the roots of the house move, but sit on”. In awe, in amor fati, pity and panic are absent. Overcoming is founded upon going under; “horizons” are evident through the “stones” that “cry out under”, but the observer elects to “sit on, seeing”. \n\n“All great love is even above all its pity; for it still wants to create the beloved.” – Friedrich Nietzsche \n\nWould you consider this to be a valid and supported interpretation of the poem? Please share any other thoughts or criticisms you might have. Thanks",

        "text": "I'm required to compare a certain local folktale to \"its original version from English literature\"\n\n The folktale tells the story of two brothers. One of them is very rich and fortunate, while the other is very poor and unfortunate. (The story is only about the unlucky brother, actually.)\n\nOne day, the poor brother heard a voice telling him that the reason behind his misfortune is that \"his luck isn't with him\", so he set out on a journey to find his luck.\n\n Through his journey, he met a weak lion that lost its strength, a tree that's dry even though it's very close to water and a young woman who is the leader of a tribe that's about to engage in war. They all asked the poor brother to help them find their own luck too, and he agreed since they were all \"poor souls like himself\".\n\nThen he met an old man who told him that he was his luck. (This old man is the poor brother's luck.)\n\nThe old man told the poor brother that he can ask him anything he wants on two conditions. He must ask all the questions at once, for if he leaves and comes back; the old man would then be fast asleep and would only answer other people's questions when he wakes up. The second condition was not to tell anyone about what he has done.\n\nWhen the poor brother asked the old man about the lion, the tree and the woman's luck; the old man said that the woman's tribe will win the war if she marries, the tree will be brought back to life if a treasure that's buried beneath it is dug up, and the lion will be cured if he eats a blind man.\n\nThe poor brother forgot to ask about his own luck and went back home. On his way, he met the young woman; and he told her that she has to marry. She asked him to marry her because she isn't allowed to marry anyone from her tribe, but he refused. He then met the tree and told her about the treasure. The tree told him to dig it, and the treasure will be all his. He refused because he was tired and that there wasn't any digging tool around. Finally, he met the lion who asked him about what happened so far. The poor brother told the lion everything he has done before he got there, forgetting the old man's warning. The lion then asked about his luck, and our guy told him that he should eat a blind man. The lion then jumped at the brother and ate him saying \"I can't possibly find a man blinder than you.\"\n\nThe end.\n\nThe folktale is filled with elements from our culture, but I didn't include them here. I just modified it to convey the general idea.\n\nI would like to know if there's a story that matches or is similar to this folktale from English literature.",

The following are her words.\n\n---\nI'm currently writing an essay on UTC. \nMy thesis statement is: \n\n\"Racially controversial books like UTC)should be mandatory high school reading material in all states, and the federal government should enforce this.\"\n \nArguments pro: \n\n1. Slavery/racism/apartheid etc are important elements of U.S. history, and these books are an important narrative to these elements. Banning these books is tantamount to covering up history as to hide any role a state might have had in the above elements.\n\n2. Without these books we are prone to fall into old patterns of discrimination and unjust treatment of minorities. This holds especially true for southern confederate states, where immigration is an active issue.  \n\nArguments con: \n\n1. It is the states' prerogative to decide which books are banned/mandatory reading\n\n2. The book has many racist features, and as such is not suitable for reading in high schools.\n\n\ni'm still working on other arguments pro/con, but my problem is as follows: \n\n1. I can't seem to find any recent information on the book's status (banned/mandatory reading). All I know is the confederate states banned it during the civil war, and Illinois banned it in 1985. \n\n2. I also can't I find any similar books. Any suggestions are welcome.\n\n3. I'm also not entirely sure of the validity of my arguments. Any critique is welcome\n\n\nI would love to ask you guys for any pointers you can give me. Any further reading would be greatly appreciated as well.\n\nThanks from a English Teaching major! :)\n\n\n",

        "text": "Firstly, this is my first post, so please forgive me if this is the wrong place to be asking this. \n\n~~My question is: does anyone know of any academic/critical writing that explores the problem of trying to analyse 'bad' or flawed works of art?~~ \n\n~~A bit of background: I've just graduated and I'm going to start an MA in film and literature in October, and in the meantime I'm writing the occasional essay-length blog post on various cyberpunk and postmodern SF films and lit (my primary research interest). Recently I was considering writing a post on Prometheus, but came up against a major stumbling block: Prometheus is a pretty flawed film. All through my education so far I have only had to analyse books and films that already have an established reputation as being 'good', canonised classics. When we analyse these we assume that the author is largely infallible - that everything in the text is present for a reason. So what happens when the author/film-maker is fallible? Are there any existing academic works that address the problem of authorial ineptitude - of trying to analyse a narrative where the author's failings compromise said narrative?~~\n\n~~I know of course that one approach would simply be to take up Barthes' theory set forth in Death of the Author (the text's unity lies not in its origins but in its destination) but I was wondering if there is any stuff more specifically addressing not the negation of the author but of tackling 'bad' works without denying the author his authority.~~ \n\nI hope all that makes sense. It's late here, apologies for any incoherencies, and thanks in advance for any help.\n\nEDIT: This was a really badly worded question, apologies. I think it would be clearer (and would presumably cover my initial question too) to ask: I'm really interested in looking academically at what is traditionally regarded as 'low' art - popular fiction, particularly crime fiction and science fiction. Are there any critics you can recommend who set out to make a case for the importance of approaching 'low' art with the same rigorous analysis as is applied to 'high' art (modernism, postmodernism etc.)?
