        "text": "Throwaway cause few of my family members are here on reddit.   \nThis happened some 20 odd years ago when I was 7 years and few months. I was a weird little kid back then(I think I still am) and as such didn't had any friends of my own and often used to play or talk with my brother's friends. None of them seemed to mind that. This one time, I tagged along with my brother who was 10 or something at that time, to one of his best friend's house. Her house's top floor was still under construction and as such didn't had any handrails/stair rails for the stairs which used to lead to the top floor and roof. We were playing a game which was something like this: Each of us would dare another to jump down a specific number of stairs from the top of the stairs. Now you would have two choices, either you can back out from the dare (hence forfeiting and ending up losing the game) or you can go ahead with the dare and jump down. If you end up on the exact step that you were asked to, then you survive that round. The game will continue until there's only one person left in the end who would then be declared the winner.  \nMy brother was explaining the rules of the game to his friend as she never played this game before. I and my brother had played this game multiple times with his other friends before, so we both were very well versed with the rules of the game. My brother was explaining the rules again and again to this girl as she couldn't understand the rules.\n\n Suddenly, I don't know what got inside me or what got hold of me but I became very impatient and decided to demonstrate the rules, by jumping down the stairs to make her understand what is needed to be done in the game, to win. My brother and this girl were standing one step below me and in order to jump down I decided to push her sideways, to make way for me to jump down. I don't know how but I ended up pushing her forward instead of sideway, different from what I actually meant to do. It wasn't a very hard push in actual sense but she lost her balance and fell down the stairs. My brother and I both watched her falling down the stairs in horror. Her head hit the last step of the stairs and her neck must have hit the second last step. Her neck got crooked and bent backwards at an angle, which a human neck is not supposed to. My brother started screaming and crying with all his might while I just stood there in shock looking below at her. Her whole body was writhing in pain, at the bottom of the stairs. I will never forget the looks in her watery eyes, just looking at me. Her mother ran to the spot after hearing my brother's screams and started screaming/crying for help after she saw her daughter, twisting uncontrollably at the bottom of the stairs. The girl stopped moving after few seconds, by the time his dad arrived at the spot. Her parents picked her up and rushed to the nearest hospital and my brother and I both left for the home together. We both were very shaken by the whole incident and my brother cried all the way back to our home while I just walked beside him, unable to grasp what happened and how to react. My brother told my mom that his friend fell down the stairs while playing with us and she started consoling him and me. By this time I started crying too. We both were crying inconsolably. \n\nThe next day, her parents came to our house to break the news of her death. She died on her way to the hospital. They were agitated and the mother was wailing. My mom took her to a different room to comfort her and the father of the girl started questioning us about what exactly happened. I was shit-scared and was afraid that everybody will either beat me to a pulp or worse, they will send me to jail. I stood there in silence while my brother started explaining the events of the previous day. I don't know why but he didn't mentioned me pushing their daughter down the stairs. They went back after a while and I was a little relieved. Later that day, my mother announced that we will never talk about this ever again and made my brother and I promised it. I thought that everything will go back to normal but unfortunately it was just the start of my miseries.\n\nThat night was the first time, I saw a nightmare, of that girl. I was standing on the same stairs beside my brother and she was lying dead at the bottom of the stairs. Her piercing dead eyes just looking at me, as if looking into my soul. I woke up screaming and thrashing my hands wildly in air. My mother rushed to my bedroom to comfort me. I didn't sleep that night. And many nights after that. I used to sleep only in the day, with the condition that my mom will sit during that time, beside me. This started to affect my studies as I was sleeping during the day when I was supposed to be attending the school.  My brother and his friends stopped talking to me. My parents became worried about me because I became very quiet and distant. I used to stay locked up all the time in my room and only used to talk to my mother. My father used to stay away from home for the most of the time because of his work. It was mid 90s at that time and mental health was non-existent. \n\nAfter six months, my mom decided to take me to our family doctor. My mom narrated the whole incident(except the part that I pushed that poor girl) after which the doctor said something in my ear and then reassured my mother that I will be ok. My mother asked me on our way back, what did the doctor said in my ear and I told her. He said, \"Tonight when you go to your bed, before lying down, whisper in your pillow that you will be ok\". My mom gave me a puzzled look but didn't said anything. Later that night, I did what the doctor told me to do. I whispered in the pillow that you will be ok and then laid down. I wasn't expecting any sleep that night just like countless nights before, but to my surprise, I actually fall asleep that night and didn't had any nightmare. I woke up in the morning, next day and was so relieved and happy. I started doing the same thing every night from that day forth and it worked every time. Slowly and gradually every thing went back to normal. I re-joined my school and picked up my studies from where I left them off. We moved to a different city because of my father's job which further helped us in putting this unfortunate incident behind us. My brother and I became close after couple of years or so and we all forgot this incident after few years.\n\n  \nBut nothing is forever. Six days back my brother and I were talking on the phone, like we usually do, every now and then. He just came back from an office party and was completely wasted. He was describing and explaining what all happened in the party. Usual stuff, someone puked over another person, a guy hitting at all the single ladies in the office. Nothing too scandalous. We both were laughing when suddenly he went all quiet and blurted out \"Mom knows\". I got confused and asked him what does he meant. He repeated the same thing couple of times before he ended the call. I called him back and demanded to know what exactly did he meant by those words. He finally told me that mom knows that I pushed that girl, all those years back. She knew that I was the reason why that girl isn't alive anymore and mom was the one, who convinced my brother back then, not to tell anyone that I pushed that girl down the stairs. Apparently, my brother told my mom everything the very first night, behind my back. She was the reason why my brother didn't tell that girl's father about me pushing that girl down the stairs. My brother also told me that mom used to cry behind close doors for many following years, till she finally moved on. I was devastated because all this time I was in the dark. All this time, I used to think that she didn't knew the truth, that my brother hid that bit from her too. I was heartbroken thinking that my family had to put up with such a hard time because of me. Later that night, when I went to sleep, I saw that nightmare again. That girl lying at the bottom, lifeless, looking at me, dead in the eyes. But this time, she said something. Something that has made me to stay awake the whole night,  from the past six days. The pillow trick that my doctor suggested so many years back, isn't working this time. I have fallen back to sleeping during the day and staying awake the whole night. I don't want to sleep. I don't want to see that nightmare again. I don't want to listen to those words again, as they make my blood run cold, every time I think about them. I don't know what to do. It's 3:45 am here right now and I'm a little sleepy, even after having six cups of coffee already. I have music blasting, at full volume, in my earphones. I just don't want to sleep. I dread that I will have that nightmare again and she will say the same words again. That she will say again, \"It's your turn to jump\".",

I never took her phone with the intention of spying but when I had her phone anyway, I just checked some messages etc.\n\nI just liked seeing she has a life. When she got a bf and started googling sex stuff I knew I should feel weird but I was SO, SO EXTREMELY HAPPY she's living her best life.\n\nI've never used any information in any way. I just enjoyed knowing she is a normal human being. Not abused, scared woman from the past. But I did invade her privacy big time.

        "text": "Yeah as the title says I drank wine while at school. I will not disclose what country I am from or how old I was at the time, but while at school I had cooking lessons and and I was tasked to make a desert so I chose a tiramisu and the recipe I found needed wine and at my school I had to buy the ingredients so I got someone who was old enough to help me buy the ingredients as the only thing I couldn’t by was the wine as at the time I wasn’t old enough. The day came and what I did was put a small amount of wine in a container so it was disguised so the teacher wouldn’t found out and the rest I just poured into an empty bottle of another drink and just put it in my bag with no one knowing someone who was underage was drinking alcohol in school. It came to lunch time and with the only friends I had I showed them the wine and we drank throughout lunchtime with no teachers finding out. It all came to an end when lunch ended and we went to our final lesson and then went home. It’s one of the fondest memories I have of me and my school friends. \n\nI don’t often look back on those times as they were often unhappy but perhaps that was one of the better moments. After school was over I never met them again in person and only saw them on social media with the only reason me being on there was to stay in contact with them and is something I have not done.\n\nI was never really happy during those years and still not if I’m honest. I can’t say I have friends anymore and I’m just as depressed and lonely as I always have been just during some of those years it wasn’t as bad.",

I truly dont deserve her which is why i feel we argue and i feel she feels stuck with me.\nI show love by what i can provide for my family, while she shows love by how much she can care for our family we see things on such a different level i dont think it will ever work (we've been though years of therapy) and dont think i will ever work out. i am numb to feelings and really dont have any care for people. \n\n (Back story)\n\n I started an IT company when i was 20 and grew it to a very successful company (wont go into details) but if i choose to not work ever again i could. Well one of my workers a 34 y/o F and i started talking and it lead to an affair which has been going on for the last year and half which ultimately lead to more females that i had affairs with. I have no feelings for these woman just enjoy how they dont seem to have feelings for me. My wife has 0 clue but i cannot keep lying to her and i cant bring it upon myself to tell her, i work so much my daughter doesnt know who i am easily 80+ hours a week I lay her down when she goes to bed but thats about it.i  have set up her future that no matter my decision she will be set for life and will never have to work if she so chooses.\n\nIve contacted my lawyers around 2 months ago and set up my company to go majority in my wifes name and a small precentage in my daughters name. (against my lawyers advice) I bought some assets for my daughter that my wife doesnt know about and the profits of those assets will be put into a bank account that she will have access to when she gets older. I promoted one of my top workers to be the ceo and feel he will do a great job in that role so my wife wont tank the company. I took a little but of money out of my company and plan on getting out of country and starting a new life in about a week. I am informing reddit about this because i watch this thread on snapchat alot and they give good advice on stuff like this. This was not my wifes fault nor my daughters fault and feel they dont deserve how i act or who i became. im giving them the option out they deserve.   Before hurting them any further.",
