        "text": "I recently watched The Whale, and in the movie a lot of emphasis is given to the daughter's essay on Moby Dick. It might be obvious, but I've done some thinking related to the titles of these two works (the movie and the book). I didn't read the book yet, but I know a thing or two about it (which is also said in the movie), like it's called \"Moby Dick, or The Whale\", so technically it has the same title as the movie. And, as they say in the movie, it's not just a book about whales, even if the title might let you think that. I think that a relation between the two titles can be found: the movie is called The Whale, and it makes you think it's a movie about obesity, its dinamics and problems, but in my opinion the focus is (also) on other themes; like in the movie, the book's title might let you think that's just about whales, and it is also about whales, but not just that. So here it is the connection between the two, again, it's simple, but I wanted to know what you think!",

So already it’s sounding weird an unpleasant but the way the film goes with it is very interesting and turns out to be a really sweet, strange “romance”, but if anything it’s really just a really good look at depression and loneliness. \n\nIt’s hard to explain just why it works but it’s kinda like “Her” with Joaquin Phoenix, on the surface it’s a really strange concept and seems like it’d be super weird, but the way it’s directed and acted makes for a very sweet, borderline romance. Now “Her” is definitely the better film but that’s not to sleep on Lars as it’s still a super solid film that handled loneliness in a very unique way with a very satisfying ending in my opinion. \n\nThat’s not to say it’s perfect, the directing isn’t very bold, cinematography wise or camera movement wise, and it has  very wishful thinking in regards to how everyone reacts to Lars but I still think it’s a very solid, enjoyable film that is one of Ryan Goslings lesser known movies that still absolutely deserves a watch. \n\nThose who have seen it, what are your thoughts on it and do you agree with my assessment or does it actually suck and I’m crazy?",

This Black Comedy/Horror film stars Brandon Adams(probably more famous for his roles in The Mighty Ducks) as a young robber named Fool who along with Ving Rhames, break into the wrong house. \n\nDefinitely not the typical Wes Craven movie, but performed very well on release, topping box offices at the time. This movie touches on multiple social issues like gentrification and child abuse. The villains are a \"couple\" that have been victimizing their neighborhood for a long time on multiple levels. Just wait until you see what they are hiding in their basement. \n\nIf you have never seen this movie, I definitely recommend it. It's a little campy but it's far from the usual horror. There was rumors of a remake several years ago, but no new developments that I can find since 2021.",

        "text": "I'm fairly new to Indian cinema, but I try to see them in theaters when I can. In more recent memory I've seen Pathaan, Brahmastra, and now RRR with the re-release (fuck that movie is awesome).\n\nOne thing that's apparently though, for all 3 movies it feels like my eardrums were blowing out. I saw all 3 in 3 different AMC theaters in the midwest and in every one I've had to put my airpods in with nothing playing, plus my hood or hat. Otherwise my ears would start crackling from the loud sound.\n\nI've seen 30 movies in the last half a year, and those are the only 3 movies I thought were too loud.\n\nAm I crazy? Or is this something that Indian films are known for?",

        "text": "I saw Jennifer Grey in an interview not that long ago, I think she was promoting her memoir, and what a lovely woman she is. Also ageless, she didn't look a day over 40 yet she was in her 60s. She always looked younger than she was. In DIRTY DANCING, she was pushing 30 but played a teen and was convincing at it. No Gabrielle Carteris. \n\nFor some reason, the movie, while a huge hit, didn't make her a movie star. She barely worked whereas Patrick Swayze became a huge star. \n\nAnd it always seemed unfair to me since Grey had the bigger and more difficult part to play. And she was so good. She was a scene stealer in the supporting parts she took prior to DD, Ferris Bueller's sister for example, but after DD, she was over. \n\nAnd the nose job didn't ruin her career since that happened 8 years after the movie.",

        "text": "Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell?? Sets that are obviously fake. Annoying bratty kids. Not much of a climax, if I'm honest. \n\nThat said, I do feel Steven Spielberg had a interesting concept. What if Peter Pan grew up and forgot his past? How exciting would that be for a movie plot? \n\nInstead they cast Robin Williams as Peter, too miscast to be taken seriously and looked more like a Flying, hyperactive Hippo than a growbn Peter. \n\nTim Curry should have played Captain Hook. Hoffman seemed like he was trying to imitate Curry's Frank N. Furter. He even sounded like him. \n\nThe best scenes were in London. The family tension, the kids driving the workaholic Peter insane, Maggie Smith as the aging Wendy. Those were my favorite sequences and I think it might have been a better movie has they focused more in London as opposed to a boring, silly adventure movie. \n\nAnd Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell was a disaster. Why would anyone cast such a cold fish like Roberts in that part? You know who'd have been an amazing Tinkerbell? EG Daily.",
