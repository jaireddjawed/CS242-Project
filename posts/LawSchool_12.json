Is it common for them to have undergrad interns? I feel like I’ve mostly only seen them for law students. Anyway, I’m really excited and really really nervous. Has anyone else done one or have any advice? I’m really wondering what kind of work I’m gonna do because they were super general about it. I think it’ll be a pretty quiet office cause this district’s mostly suburbs, but it’s the suburbs of a big city so idk.",

I met with the admissions dean at my dream university, and she told me that it is IMPOSSIBLE for a first-year (and even second and third-year) law student to work and attend law school. So here is my question: How are you guys paying for school while also paying your rent, car payments, insurance, and other little things? I know loans are a thing and also a lot of universities give out scholarships but I have no one to support me, I live on my own, I have a car that I need to pay off, insurances to pay, and need to be able to have money set aside for emergencies. What are some things you would recommend I do to save money or have some sort of income without necessarily having a job? IDC, if your idea is stupid, I am desperate and need to find a way to pay for being alive while attending school. ANY answer and advice would be greatly appreciated!",

They are about to both be in school and I am contemplating my next move. \n\nFor the work I want to do - and have volunteered in for years - it is clear to me that lawyers are best positioned to make substantive change. There is good work I could do in this field with a social work degree, but I feel frustrated with the lack of power I’d have to accept if I went that route.\n\nMy family is settled in our area, so I won’t be moving for school. There is a law school that is well regarded in the area that is considered “fourth tier” nationally. There are professors who are knowledgeable about the field I want to work in and have mentored lawyers who do the kind of work I want to do in my area. I think it’s possible I could get even a full scholarship with my academic record. \n\nWhen I became aware of lawyers who were designing legal strategy around a certain kind of advocacy with results I could only imagine before, I felt what I can only describe as burning passion to do the same. However, I am cautious about going to school again, especially law school given the slog I know it is. Given what I’ve described, would you pursue law school in my situation?",

I'm not entirely sure what I want to do after graduation, besides that I have always been interested in federal government work and will probably be applying for DOJ honors and other fed gov positions after graduation. \n\nI am currently weighing offers between a State DOJ internship in the Criminal Appeals Section and a summer internship with the State ACLU. I am not especially interested in criminal work, but I enjoy appellate work since I enjoy research and writing. So really, I am just trying to figure out whether the government experience is worth it even though its not necessarily the practice area I want to do.\n\nWhile the State DOJ is unpaid, my school provides a modest stipend for doing PI work that I have to apply for and the ACLU job provides a guaranteed slightly larger stipend. ACLU would require me to move for the summer to a larger city within the state so the slightly larger amount would likely be cancelled out by increased rent and moving costs. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/118dl5h)",

I currently work for one of the main commercial bar review companies, and I cannot stress enough how beneficial it is to become a student rep. \n\nI'm not saying this because I need student reps (lol), but I regret not becoming a student rep while in law school because of all the easy money students get for bringing in enrollments. You save thousands of dollars on bar prep, and you get to earn cash money or prizes just for convincing a few friends to enroll with the company you work for. It's literally the easiest job if you have a good regional director. \n\nFrom my perspective, almost all law schools (especially the T20 schools) are not good at informing students about the bar exam and its associated costs. That makes my job harder because students don't want to be student reps because they don't think they need it, but will complain about the costs and ask for discounts. Trust me, I don't think the costs of these courses should be so high and I am the first one to say abolish the bar. However, these are the cards which we are dealt and it is in your best interest to maximize the available opportunities. Barbri, Kaplan, Quimbee, and Themis are always looking for student reps at all law schools. \n\nReach out to an academic support professional if you have trouble finding the contact information for the bar review regional directors at your law school. For the love of all things good and holy, take my advice and become a student rep!",

I'm still waiting to hear back from the other schools (a few T14s but those are complete long shots so I'm not holding my breath, plus several schools ranked T40-55).

        "text": "Hey everyone! I have the need for some brutally honest advice, and no better place to go than this sub. \n\nFall of 2022 I was a 1L in a online program working 25-35 hours a week and taking classes.  I struggled to keep up, but I thought I was still above water. Grades were posted, and of course, D’s all around. I was devastated, but could not say I wasn’t surprised. I failed my midterms, and after meeting with my professors, I found that I probably passed my finals I just had a shitty average that tanked my final grade. That really sucked. I wasn’t about to take out another 30k in debt so I took a semester off and the school and I agreed I would return in the fall as 1L again. \n\nAt this point I had been working at a local law firm as a legal assistant for about six months, and breaking the news to 5 attorneys was less than pleasurable. My hours there were dwindling as well as my work load, and my pay was getting close to what I could make at McDonalds. Through some talk and encouragement from my friends and family I left my job at the firm and took a full break from law and got a job as a server. I have been working 50+ hours a week and making much more than I was, and paying off my debts quickly and it feels so good. \n\nHere comes the dilemma. My partner says he’s never seen me happier. I am making great money and progress toward credit card/college debt, and still have spending money (I love spending, my favorite guilty pleasure), I have free time for myself and for me and my hubby. But law school is waiting for me. I really did enjoy it last fall. I loved learning and being challenged and I loved throwing myself into something so passionately. But that also means no more working, no more spending, no more free time. I’ve had a taste of both worlds, and I need all the help I can get. TIA. &lt;3",

I am a paralegal who worked in a small law firm and moved about a year ago to a larger corporation. I have started applying to law schools and have gotten great acceptances to both part-time law and full-time law. My job is very flexible and has a great environment; it is online, so I would have the opportunity to work while I study at any university, and my team is excellent. My dilemma is that I don’t know what would be the best decision in my career. I was accepted at a T20 law school with a great scholarship and a couple of great PT programs with great scholarships. Both PT programs are T50 universities and T5 for their part-time programs. I understand that law school ranking is important when it comes to certain employers; however, I would have more years of experience if I continued to work through law school even if I didn’t attend a T20 law school (and I would be more financially stable than otherwise) I don’t know what would be my best choice. I might have many misconceptions when it comes to the legal working market coming out of college, but these are all concepts that have been spoken about to great lengths by people going to law school. Can anyone give me some honest advice? I’d greatly appreciate it!!",
