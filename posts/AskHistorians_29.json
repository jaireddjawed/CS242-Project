Right now, my assumption is that the upper classes wouldn't know how to cook because they'd never stay somewhere without a servant; as for the urban poor, if what I learned about life in the slums during the Victorian era continues in the '20s, then they wouldn't be able to cook on account of their flats not having a kitchen.",

The strange thing is how often they seem to arrange and rearrange political marriages, with very few of them producing children children. I can only assume that this was intentional?\n\n**Julius Caesar seems to start the trend:** One biological daughter, one illegitimate son (that we know of), one adopted son; married at least three times.\n\nThe Julio-Claudians follow his example like clockwork:\n\n**Augustus:** One biological daughter, four adopted sons; married three times\n**Tiberius:** Two biological children (one died in infancy), one adopted son; married twice\n**Caligula:** One biological daughter; married four times\n**Nero:** One biological daughter; married five times\n\nSome, however -- Julio-Claudians or not -- do buck the trend...\n**Claudius:** Four biological children, one adopted son, married four times\n**Vespasian:** Three biological children, \"officially\" married once\n\nMost of the Nerva-Antonine dynasty also carried on the tradition, but I'll stop these exhaustive lists with them because I don't want to be here all night:\n\n**Nerva:** One adopted son; never married\n**Trajan:** Two adopted children; unhappily married once (this one isn't a surprise though)\n**Hadrian:** Two adopted children; *very* unhappily married once (again, still not a surprise)\n**Antoninus Pius:** One daughter who survived to adulthood, two sons who did not, two adopted sons; married once\n**Lucius Verus:** Three children who all died young; married once\n**Commodus:** No children; married once\n\nMarcus Aurelius is the massive outlier across all of classical Roman history, with a grand total of *fourteen children!*\n\nThe emperors in the difficult years following Commodus and in the Crisis of the Third Century follow suit: Between Pertinax and Diocletion, only three emperors had more than two biological children, and a fair few of them had no children at all.\n\nIs it an inheritance thing? Marry more than once for the political clout, but make sure you only have one heir so there aren't factions fighting for your legacy after you die? Fat lot of good that did, if so...\n\nCould it also just be that they *did* have more children, but record of the ones that didn't make it to adulthood simply weren't preserved?",

China vs Tibet vs Manchuria?\n* What forms were authors writing in? Poetry or prose? I know that the \"novel\" is pretty much a Western invention, so what forms would Qing authors be writing in that used long-form prose?\n* Speaking of Western novels, were Qing authors influenced by Western literature? Did they decide to write \"novels\" based on European contact?\n* Finally, who were some of the most impactful authors/poets?\n\nSince I know that these are big questions, I'm ok with answers that only partially address them or that can only address, say, Qing China and not the whole Qing Empire.",

For example, blacksmithing is very hard labor, it requires the blacksmiths to be supplied materials such as iron in order to forge weapons and armor, so it would also require the labor of many miners, and then they would have to have a certain level of craftsmanship to order to make custom fits for every soldier as well as supply them with swords.",

Sometimes you're taken away from your parents and sent to a religious school before your family has a chance to teach you about your own people's religion.\n\nBut clearly missionaries - Christian, Muslim, and others - have had *some* success without force, especially when these religions were new and growing. Was it really that common for someone to listen to a foreigner tell them their gods are all fake, and that his is real, and then say \"Hey, you might be on to something there, tell me more.\"?\n\nWhen I look at people with strong religious feelings now, I can't possibly imagine how hard it would be for them to agree to switch to some other completely different spiritual viewpoint, and I can't help but project this steadfastness back on people from the distant past, as well.

        "text": "Prior 1900s, the region was home to multitude of distinct indigenous groups which they resisted against both french and vietnamese encroachments. These groups are more likely akin to the Cham (Malayo-Polynesian) and other indigenous aboriginal peoples in Australia rather than groups like the Chinese and Vietnamese (we can look at their physical appearances showing vastly difference in both genetics and ethnicity) and they adhere to native beliefs. Interestingly, they were barely affected or interacted with anyone in lowland nearby, giving them distinctly culture with no foreign influence, helping them retain such high degree of political autonomy from any lowland wet-rice based civilizations surrounding them. Kind of aboriginal Australians before European colonialism. So basically before 1890s there were very few Vietnamese, Laotian, or Cambodian settled in the Central Highlands. Vietnamese considered the indigenous tribes barbaric and abstained from contacting them. Then after conquering Vietnam in late 1800s, to fulfill sovereignty claims over Vietnam, the French used military to conquer the Central Highlands and integrated them into French Annam (Central Vietnam). French and Vietnamese Catholic priests began to venture in the highland and described the indigenous peoples (French called them Moi or Montagnards) as savages, hoping that they could be 'schooled' by European 'civilizing mission.' The French Colonial empire then opened the permission for the entry of massive European-Vietnamese colonists in 1916 to serve the rising demand of rubber and war materials. There were series of indigenous uprisings against French rules continued to disrupt colonization of the Central Highlands. More and more indigenous lands were taken and settled by Franco-Vietnamese (eg Emperor Bai Dai's palace in Da Lat). After got kicked out in the French Indochina war, France lost most possessions in the Central Highlands to South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese government was rather a settler chauvinist regime they only served the interests of ethnic Kinh especially Catholic one like the during the administration of conservative Ngo Dinh Diem who was a Kinh Catholic nationalist, indigenous peoples such as the highland tribes and the Cham face heavy racial discriminations, their languages in school were banned, their lands confiscated and given to northern Kinh 'refugee' (irl French collaborators and Kinh chauvinists). During  the 1950s 200,000 Kinh majority were Catholic settlers seized Central Highland lands and native tribes were expelled into deep jungles. This pushed many members of indigenous peoples to join the communist north because the north Vietnamese promised equal citizenships and autonomy to indigenous peoples. But in our timeline, after the war the North Vietnamese leadership broke their promises and resumed the colonization of the Central Highlands. The antiracist FULRO ( United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races) when it was founded its main objective certainly was fighting against the South Vietnamese government but when the south collapsed and the victorious Viet communists continued to treat indigenous peoples very bad so a little bit further they renewed their insurgency against the unified communist Vietnam and that how they got branded 'anticommunist' by western lefties. It's little weird though consider how much most people have talked about how French colonized Vietnam, but ignored how French colonized the Central Highlands (which was no belonging to Vietnam till French Indochina) and successive Vietnamese colonization today. Also people have no idea how Catholics' profound roles in the colonization of Vietnam's Central Highlands. So how do today Catholics perceive the issue, was that the same as Canada's brutal assimilation of indigenous peoples in Catholic schools?  \n\n\nThis book is quite fascinating regards the fringe aspects of the French colonial empire and Indochina Communist movements: Oscar Salemink, The Ethnography of Vietnam's Central Highlanders: A Historical Contextualization 1850-1990.

There's an obvious rational there re: a democracy and voting for districting. But they also seem to have been meaningful bodies in their own right: discrete, self contained and semi sufficient corporations (i.e. in the non business sense) and it strikes me each phyle having a viable slice of each of the lifestyle / subsistence patterns was important in a way that's illegible to a modern reader. \n\nIt echoes the Andes and the Irish _tuatha_ for me. The Incan empire has been described as having little to no market economy, argued largely because _ayllu_ clans strove to be self sufficient. I have read extended families would settle colonies in different climactic zones to grow diferent crops and exchange within the extended family, largely making a market unnecessary. \n\nIn pre-Norman Ireland clutches of a hundred houses would be allied together to form tribes/clans and that _tuath_ would have its own judiciary, militia, leader etc. They likewise formed the salient body for society. \n\nAbsent joint-stock companies, powerful central governments or religious organizations, or an established functioning market, this seems like one of the few ways to develop compex endeavors, be resilient socially, and obtain a diverse material life.

        "text": "I’m interested in what I should look up across history when states or people actively pursued poor foreign policies. Not necessarily foreign policies that could be construed as ‘evil’ or ‘morally wrong’, but policies that negatively effected the country or person pursing them. Most of my search results just vomit the same rehashed US Foreign Policy views from the past 50 years (with political seasoning to taste). I’m hoping anyone might have suggestions for learning about a variety of poor foreign policy choices from across history, either looking back in hindsight, or seen contemporarily as poor policy. Now that I’m writing this Wilhelm II’s foreign policy springs to mind.",

Vampires attack people and livestock by biting and sucking their blood.\n \nRabies is transmitted through biting, just as vampireism is transmitted through biting.\n \nRabies causes similar symptoms in humans and animals like dogs, wolves, cats, and bats, and vampires are believed to be able to take the form of animals (usually dogs, wolves, cats, and bats) and attack while in these forms.\n \nInsomnia and agitation are symptoms of rabies, and vampires are called the creatures of the night because they are more active at night.\n \nPeople with rabies have hydrophobia and have spasms at the sight of water, and vampires are repelled by holy water and are buried in lakes or have water poured around their coffins to prevent them from leaving their grave.\n \nSo, my question is, did people take rabies and construct stories around it and create vampirism? \n \n ",
