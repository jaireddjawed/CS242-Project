This was denied. \nEventually the defendant received definitive proof via the landlord, via entry of the property and photograph of the victim’s departure. \nThe victim still claimed to be living there in an attempt to block the defendant from the house and likely cost him additional finical burden.  \nAdditionally, the victim requested to be removed from the lease - but the landlord did not wish to do so. \n\nThe defendants lawyer filed for a motion to amend bail given the new information, which was today 1/26. \nThe judge agreed with the defendants argument and is creating an order that allows the defendant to return home. \nHowever, at the same time - the defendant was served for the temporary DV restraining order, and a hearing was scheduled for the 15th of February.\nIn this order it specified the defendant was not allowed to return to the address originally stated when the order was filed.\n\nThe judge claimed that he could not amend said order on the stop, regardless if he was amending the current order in lieu of evidence.\n\nThe defendants lawyer argued that he could do this, but the judge did not believe he had the authority to do so. \nHe then said he would amend it, but only if the defendants lawyer could point to another case where this occurred. \n\nMy question is just that - can anyone point to a specific case where one judge was allowed to amend another’s temporary restraining order in lieu of evidence? \nIf so, please provide that information. \n\nThe case is in NH. \n\nThank you!",

I have been slowly studying for the LSAT and content-wise, I think I'll be okay, but the time constraint is really difficult for me. I'd love any tips on how to study effectively for the LSAT on your own- I just can't afford thousands of dollars in test prep classes and materials. I have a prep book that I've been practicing my way through and reading regularly, but I feel like I'll be behind my peers regardless. As of now, I'm planning on taking the LSAT in April and possibly in June.\n\nI'm also afraid that upon entering law school I just won't know what to expect and again, be behind. A lot of the people that I know who are also planning on going to law school have parents or close family who are lawyers and they can talk to them about it. I don't want the shock of law school and not knowing things to be a reason I won't succeed.\n\nIf anyone is also a first gen law student or scored well on the LSAT from self-guided study, I'd love to hear any advice you have!

        "text": "Soo.... I tried Chat GPT. \n\nMe: Explain the difference between common law burglary and california's statutory burglary\n\nChatGPT:\n\n&gt;Common law burglary, also known as traditional or at common law burglary, is a type of criminal offense that involves the unauthorized entry into a building or structure with the intent to commit a crime inside. It typically requires proof of breaking and entering, as well as intent to commit a crime.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;California's statutory burglary, on the other hand, is defined by the state's penal code and is broader in scope than common law burglary. It includes not only the traditional elements of common law burglary (unauthorized entry and intent to commit a crime), but also includes the unauthorized entry into any locked or unlocked vehicle, house trailer, or vessel with intent to commit a felony or theft.\n\nMe: Common law burglary also requires the act to be committed at night time.\n\n&gt;Yes, you are correct. In addition to the elements of unauthorized entry and intent to commit a crime, common law burglary also traditionally required that the crime be committed at night time. This requirement is known as the \"felony-at-night\" rule, which meant that a person could not be found guilty of common law burglary unless the crime was committed during the nighttime hours.\n\nThen I asked about an assignment I had to do for Remedies. I won't post the question to avoid any accusation of academic dishonesty. Oh, and I already got my grade back on it, so just to clarify: I'm not cheating. \n\nThe fact pattern revolves around a sports coach who agrees to coach a college team but renegs prior to the start of the season. The question asks about available remedies.\n\nChatGPT:\n\n&gt;In this scenario, X University should be granted specific performance of Coach's contract with X University. Specific performance is a legal remedy in which a court orders a party to fulfill their obligations under a contract, rather than awarding damages. In this case, the court would order Coach to fulfill his obligations as coach for X University for the one-year term specified in the contract.\n\nMe: Your response is wrong. Specific performance for an employment contract cannot be granted under the U.S. Constitution, as it would require a person to be compelled to work.\n\n&gt;I apologize for the confusion, you are correct that specific performance cannot be granted for an employment contract, as it would be a violation of the 13th amendment of the US Constitution, which prohibits involuntary servitude.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;An employer can't force an employee to work, and courts generally do not have the authority to order someone to work for a specific employer. In the scenario given, if Coach breaches the contract by not fulfilling his obligations as coach for X University, the University would be entitled to seek damages, which would be calculated based on the loss that the University suffered as a result of the breach of contract.\n\nSo, I would not entrust my assignments to AI just yet.",

Roughly top 1/3 at T14. \n\nI'm currently sitting on an expiring offer for a fed gov internship this summer. \n\nI've completed three screener interviews for 1L SAs and am waiting for callbacks. (I'm also waiting on around 6-7 other firms that I haven't heard anything from.) \n\nIdeally I would like to get a 1L SA this summer, but the fed gov internship is the clear #2 choice (that I would still be really happy with.) I don't want to turn down the fed gov internship only to get rejected at all the firms I interviewed/applied to. \n\nIs it acceptable practice to ask firms I have done screeners with to provide an update of my status? If so, what's the best way to phrase it? \n\nAnd what would be the best way to ask for an extension from the fed gov internship without sounding disinterested? \n\nThanks very much.",
