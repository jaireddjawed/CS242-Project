After originally planning to go a bit more conventional and use 16mm stock, after our test shoots we found that we had to push our film like three stops to get close to the sort of look that we wanted, but with Super 8 we could get a better result while filming and processing normally. \n\nMy question is in regards to feature films, made recently or in times long since past, that were shot on Super 8 or 8mm film, do you know of any, and if so have the filmmakers spoken on their choice to use it instead of more conventional movie stock? I know of quite a few short films from the 80s and 90s that fit, but no features come to mind. I would really like to know about, and watch some of them!",

I know it's not critically acclaimed, but there's always at least one or two really solid jokes, usually said by Stewie as he works as sort of a meta character, commenting on the action therein.  I kind of started thinking about whatever happened to the high quality low-brow parody film.\n\nThere was a period, mainly the 1970s and 1980s, where it was very popular.  *Airplane!* was a parody of the *Airport* staple disaster films.  *Top Secret!* parodied 1950s Elvis movies as well as general Cold War spy fiction.  Even *Real Genius* counts, I basically count anything that seems to value jokes over message, theme, etc.  If you want to stretch the definition, it could be argued that things like *Caddyshack* and *Animal House* are parody films.\n\nMel Brooks is another master of the form, having done *High Anxiety* and *Young Frankenstein,* movies that parodied out of love and affection, not crass commercialism.\n\nThat genre has been tarnished lately, mainly due to Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedman.  They introduced a level of humor that's literally \"this is a pop culture reference.  Enjoy?\"  There's a reference to \"Leave Britney Alone\" in *Meet The Spartans* for some reason.  There's a character based on Juno in *Disaster Movie.*  IMHO, and I know this won't be that controversial, they could be the worst filmmakers of all time.  Even Ed Wood and the director of *Manos: The Hands of Fate* were at least charming and were making films because they genuinely loved it.    \n\nThere's been attempts to bring it back, *Walk Hard* got pretty good reviews, but fell flat at the box office.  \n\nIt's a shame that parodies aren't as popular anymore, as a good one can be a classic in and of itself.  Who even remembers the original *Airport* movies?  And there's plenty of genres to be taken advantage of, from Marvel's \"quippy heroes band together to save the planet from an army of aliens\" to the endless *Fast and Furious Family* movies, to the late '00s trend of having \"hey, I'm a manbaby and all the women in my life are exasperated\" Apatow family of films.  And I actually *like* most of my examples, but you can't say there's not a formula to most of them.\n\nI actually think Seth MacFarlane and Alec Sulkin are way better than the material they usually come up with.  I don't know how they can be so witty on Twitter and fall so flat in their own productions.  And if Trey and Matt from *South Park* ever wanted to up their output, they'd be another great pair of hands to parody films.  Hell, they already did it once with *Team America* taking the piss out of Michael Bay movies.  If only that had actually stopped them...",

        "text": "# The Art of Silent Cinema\n\n**T**he silent film era was an indelible influence on the decades of cinema that came after, but silent films are also valuable independently of sound films. These films are valuable *because* they use a cinematic language very different from most sound films. Compared to later films, films produced in the 1920s faced many technical limitations, including the lack of sound; however, this limitation resulted in countless displays of brilliance that would not have been possible if the sound had always been a feature of cinema. Silent cinema is a complete art form in itself, and while the advent of sound opened up many new avenues of expression in film, this lack didn’t hinder the greatest silent films.\n\nArtist’s intent is an important factor to take into account in relation to the silent film. While the silent film was the only method filmmakers had at their disposal until well into the 1920s, these filmmakers still created their art without sound and intended audiences to experience it without sound. Silent films are works of art specifically crafted with the lack of sound in mind, so the addition of sound does not necessarily improve a silent film. In this sense, silent films are complete in the same way black and white films are complete: not in spite of their lack of color, but completely independently of that lack. The entire concept of color cinema is completely irrelevant to the quality of black and white cinema, and the same idea also applies to silent cinema in relation to sound. And while a work of art should be judged independently of its author’s intent, the author’s intent is still the most vital part of the creative process and cannot be completely disregarded when assessing the work.\n\nChaplin’s updated sound version of *The Gold Rush* is a good example. While most of Chaplin’s changes to the film are positive ones (the romantic subplot feels much less mean-spirited in the altered version, for example), the actual addition of Chaplin’s narration is completely unnecessary. It covers more than just the film’s intertitles, and it often comes off as Chaplin explaining the jokes, making them less funny in the process. Chaplin was one of the most successful filmmakers in terms of transitioning from silent to sound cinema (artistically if not commercially), but that’s because he made his sound films with sound in mind. *The Gold Rush*, on the other hand, was a silent film with sound tacked on later purely for the purpose of reigniting public interest in the film, and while it succeeded in that regard, the addition of sound harmed the film from an artistic standpoint.\n\nThe matter of artist’s intent becomes even more relevant when it comes to silent films made during the sound era. While I couldn’t say whether Carl Dreyer would have been able to film *The Passion of Joan of Arc* with sound if he had wanted to, he directed the film after sound had entered the world of cinema, and he even doubled down on the film’s silence; he apparently never encountered a score of which he approved following the film’s release. This is an excellent example of a thorough disregard for sound in any stage of the filmmaking process, even at the point at which the audience experiences the finished product; while virtually every person who saw the film would have seen it with musical accompaniment, sound simply wasn’t a concern for the director. The film’s lack of sound draws more attention to the visual performances, which are clearly a heavy focus given the film’s emphasis on close-ups; these alone cemented the legendary status of Falconetti’s performance, even though she has no audible dialogue in the film. Modern filmmakers have control over a film’s soundtrack; this was also the case with *The Passion of Joan of Arc*, and for all intents and purposes, the soundtrack that Dreyer chose was silence. Saying that lack of sound is purely a hindrance denies the deliberate creation of the filmmaker.\n\nNot only is the limitation of silence integral to silent films, the greatest silent films actually derive their brilliance *from* this limitation. The lack of sound drives filmmakers to place additional emphasis on the film’s imagery, funneling all of a film’s impact and staying power into the visual element. While sound films are able to strike a balance with their impactful elements between sound and vision, in silent cinema the visuals are the sole method of conveying these elements, lending them a powerless common in dramatic sound films. Even traditional dramatic silent films receive this less naturalistic treatment, which emphasizes a certain *un*reality to convey story and themes. This approach provides more fantastical possibilities even in drama films, accompanying a relatively grounded and serious story. Because of that exaggerated fantastical element, the silent drama is often melodrama, which isn’t a bad thing. It’s simply an alternative method of displaying emotion that works particularly well in silent cinema. The German expressionists made excellent use of striking visuals to convey theme and emotion, but filmmakers accomplished it in various ways around the world: the horses galloping through the sky in Sjöström’s *The Wind*; the army of the wrathful dead in Gance’s *J’accuse* (which loses a significant portion of its energy and pathos in Gance’s sound remake); the kinetic energy of the editing in Vertov’s *Man With a Movie Camera*; the pure physicality in the comedies of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd. All of the great silent filmmakers found ways to express themselves visually, often outside the realm of reality, partially as a result of their films’ lack of sound. From special effects to overacting, many silent films feature an exuberance in the unabashed explicitness of their conveyance of theme that serves as a compelling substitute for the more naturalistic possibilities provided by sound.\n\nI’d like to clarify that this drifting away from visual exaggeration in the sound era applies mostly to more serious dramatic films, the purpose of which is to present their stories in a relatively realistic fashion – a purpose naturally aided by the addition of sound. The primary strength of the silent film that I’m describing here is the unrealistic approach it takes to realistic matters, which would be mostly lost by the 1930s. Obviously, the more surreal elements of cinema remained in films that are inherently unrealistic in terms of story, such as fantasy and horror films.\n\nI’d also like to reiterate that this is in no way an attack on sound cinema; on the contrary, the introduction of sound opened countless possibilities to be explored, and it was inevitable that silent cinema would fall by the wayside in light of this immense technological advancement. The use of sound does not categorically destroy the possibilities and methods that the silent era brought to the forefront; it simply means that the influx of new alternative methods obscured the old ones. As I mentioned previously, this shift away from more surreal visual elements is seen primarily in more serious drama films, rather than in genre films where exaggeration is more common (see *The Wizard of Oz*, the fantasy films of Cocteau, or the Universal horror films). That said, there are plenty of dramatic sound films that do an excellent job of following in the footsteps of visually melodramatic silent films: *The Red Shoes* with its dreamlike ballet sequence; *Ordet* with its miraculous resurrection; Jean’s underwater vision in *L’Atalante*; *The Night of the Hunter’s* expressionist sets and lighting. These films show that the melodramatic approach of silent films can and often does work even in sound films.\n\nIt’s undeniable that the lack of sound in films produced in the 1920s is indeed a limitation relative to the possibilities opened up by later technical advancements, but silent films have merit in themselves, as the lack of sound allowed them to use a different cinematic language that is in no way inferior to those that came later. Silent films aren’t just relics of the past, valuable only as a glimpse into the early days of cinema. Many silent films are easily comparable in technique, quality, and artistic vision to the best that sound cinema has to offer, and we owe them just as much love as their more vocal successors.

        "text": "So Tarantino's new film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood started filming about 10 days ago. The cast is released and it's been getting tons of flack and criticism from different news outlets and of course, Twitter users. People have been commenting about the lack of women and the abundance of white actors in the cast. I just wanted to give my two cents about this topic and hopefully start a peaceful discussion about it in the comments.\n\nPersonally, I think this criticism is unfair and a little immature. There's been so much talk over the past few years about the lack of representation in movies and entertainment industry and it still hasn't ended apparently. Now, I understand that over the years there hasn't been many films that have black people as the main characters without shedding a bad light on them. Spike Lee was a great director for showing black stories in a good light. There have also been a lot of movies releasing with women as the central focus, like Wonder Woman, Hidden Figures and the newest Ghostbusters. These have all been great movies for showcasing diversity and I think a lot of people seem to overlook them. Another thing people seem to overlook is the fact that these movies with primarily white men in them are NOT made for the purpose of excluding or discriminating against anyone. The purpose of these movies are to entertain and to act as a piece of art, not a political statement. I also think that if you ask many black people or women, you'll find they aren't bothered by white males in movies. This issue with lack of diversity in film seemed to be a non-issue until it was brought up in the past years. Now, it's all anyone can talk about. \n\nI know for me, a woman who is heavily into film and wants to make films myself, I've NEVER, not once been bothered by the lack of women in film. In fact, I didn't even notice it until people brought it up. Even then, it's not something I see as a problem. Movies aren't about men or women, or whites or blacks. They're about people. They're about the actual characters and their stories. The focus is not supposed to be on their race or gender (most movies), it's supposed to be on the story and the overall film. Forcing diversity is not the answer. This causes black people to be placed in films and entertainment just for the purpose of diveristy and it doesn't work well. The fact also remains that most actors are hired because of their acting skills, not because of their race. Also, when writers are coming up with their ideas, the appearance of a character is often one of the first things that they come up with, and in most cases (at least in my personal experience), the appearance of the character isn't something they choose, it's something that just happens. So, if a character is white in their head, they're most likely going to cast a white actor. Same goes for hair colour and height. This isn't always the case but I feel like this is what happens a lot of the time. If you're a white person, most of your characters will be white because that's what your mind automatically imagines. Again, not always the case but this seems to be what happens majority of the time. The same thing goes for every other race. Black writers will most likely come up with characters who are Black, Japanese writers will most likely come up with characters who are Japanese. It also has to do with where you grow up. If you grow up in a primarily white community, then your mind will also automatically go to a white character. But, if you're white and you grew up in a very diverse community, you might have a tendency to come up with characters of different races. There are a lot of factors and this doesn't actually mean anything. I think people are way too focused on forcing diversity instead of the actual quality of filmmaking. Plus, in our western culture, there is hardly a problem with diversity. It's a little ridiculous to suggest that there's a diversity problem in Hollywood. America is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world. Just look at any other country and the movies from them. Japanese movies only feature Japanese actors, African movies only feature African actors, French movies only feature French actors. Those countries have a problem with diversity, if anything. \n\nMy last point is that these claims and these people who have a problem with diversity in films aren't focusing on the real issue in Hollywood. I think a lot of them choose to focus on the lack of black characters and the lack of women when in reality this isn't where there's a lack of diversity at all. Again, I really don't think Hollywood has an issue with diversity but if they do, it's definitely with the lack of Asians in movies. Seriously, wrongly representing Asians has been a problem for a while in Hollywood. Look at films like Breakfast at Tiffany's. Obviously everyone would agree that it's a very racist portrayal of an Asian character. But what a lot of people don't seem to realize is that the same thing, on a lesser level is still happening. Just look at Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell (2017). Ghost in the Shell is originally a Japanese manga, as well as an anime. It's very clear that this character was meant to be Japanese, and yet for some reason, Scarlett Johansson, the very white actress was cast. I know this example has been mentioned a few times but these types of diversity issues aren't brought up nearly as much as the ones about black people or women. Another issue with poor Asian representation in films (and TV) is the actual way a lot of Asian characters are portrayed. In comedies, Asian characters are often portrayed as nerds, socially awkward or simply unaware. They're also frequently portrayed as being \"asexual\" or unable to interact with women at all. Some examples are Raj from Big Bang Theory and Han from Two Broke Girls. Both these shows do exactly what Breakfast at Tiffany's did years ago but for some reason people completely overlook that. In my opinion, if there's an issue with diversity in Hollywood, this is it.\n\nTo end this, I'd just like to state that I'm a woman who plans on being a filmmaker. I plan to write and direct my own films. I think it's funny because most women directors in the industry tend to make movies with \"strong independent women\" as their main characters and heavily focus on bringing women into the Hollywood spotlight. I'm sure that once I reach the filmmaking industry, everyone will expect me to do the same thing. But I can assure you that I will not be making movies with \"strong independent women.\" Coincidentally, 99% of my ideas for movies are about men and rarely feature women. I find male characters easier to write and develop. Even when writing romances, they tend to be romances between two men because I just can't get the hang of writing women characters and they never turn out as well. I think it's just funny and I can't wait for everyone on Twitter to be blown away when a woman in film doesn't make one movie like Wonder Woman. Maybe then they'll rethink? Anyways, I apologize for that being so long. I tend to go on tangents and I feel like everything i said was necessary to get my point across. Hopefully we can have a civil conversation about this topic in the comments!\n\nEDIT: thanks to everyone in the comments for being civil and having an open discussion about this! I often see people with opposing views getting angry at each other. We're so quick to judge and hate on each other without actually listening to what we have to say. It's nice to see that nice, respectful conversations like this can happen!",

        "text": "Lately there's been a spate of posts about the best way to induce others – the unenlightened masses – down the glorious high path of cinephilia. There seems to be a notion floating around that this is a desirable thing to do. (One guy even wrote a few weeks ago asking how he could perform this alchemical operation on himself. His tastes, I guess, were not up to his image of what his own tastes should be.)\n\nNeedless to say, this is a silly idea. It's silly mainly because *it's okay not to like whatever movie*. No one is under any obligation – moral, aesthetic, social, cultural – to like things they don't like, just because other people do. De gustibus non est disputandum (despite the 70&amp;#37; of the non-porn internet precisely devoted to disputanduming it). Hopefully nuff said.\n\nThe other reason it doesn't make a lot of sense to force other people into appreciating film is that we all came to our cinephilia in different ways. That's what I want to focus on here. For all of us, there was a moment – most likely many moments – when we encountered a movie that changed the way we think of movies, that caused us to rear back in our seats and think, \"so *that's* what they can do.\" For most of us I suspect this happened in high school; for some, doubtless, college; others maybe came to cineJesus later in life. Maybe you were channel surfing late at night and found something unexpected on basic cable. Maybe a lurid VHS cover lured you in at the local Blockbuster. Maybe you snuck a peek at something in your parents' Netflix queue. What I'd like to hear is some of your stories. What were you watching? How did it gobsmack you? How did it change your perception of the capacities, affinities, and/or pleasures of the movies?\n\nLike I said, this experience – the shock of the possible – is one that all cinephiles have many times over. But maybe you have one memory that stands above the others, a real light-dawning kind of moment. Please do share it.\n\nHere's one from me. The last few years of high school, we'd often gather to watch movies in friend Dan's basement, me and him and Lizzie. Sometimes our sisters would join. We'd take turns renting movies from the local video store. I'd say our tastes were wide-ranging but still, you know, pretty conservative. Then one night we came home with Peter Greenaway's *The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover.* If you've seen it, you don't need me to tell you how stunning it is: eye-popping color schemes, frenzied mise-en-scene, operatic arias, elaborately geometrical plans sequences, sex and death and literature and rotting meat and cannibalism...a rich text, as Barthes would put it. Well, that was great and all, but what was really stunning was my friends' reactions. They *hated* it. They thought it was a bore, a chore, a whole heap of not much interesting. And over here I'm in aesthetic rapture, borderline tears. I just couldn't understand it. How could we all be watching the same movie, but see such different movies? \n\nWhat that experience showed me wasn't that movies can be amazing (I think I already knew that), but that there's a kind of movie that amazes me but doesn't amaze others. And it went to figure, then, that if other people weren't going to be introducing me to these films, I would have to seek them out on my own. I would have to find my tribe.",

        "text": "Is it better to speak or to die? That is the question 2017’s lauded piece of celluloid poses to viewers as a 17 year old Timothée Chalamet proposes to a 24 year old Armie Hammer in a 1983 Northern Italy estate, captured in lushious 35mm film and projected in cinemas around the world for all to answer: Is it better to speak or to die? \n\nThere is a certain type of actor that has transcended performance. They have abandoned masks, and pretending, and even character itself. They are no longer acting. They have become the people they have so desperately desired to enhabit. Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer are among this leagues of performers. In Call Me by Your Name, a glance or a moment of pause possesses immense informational and emotional power. Take this moment from the trailer, Michael Stuhlbarg is explaining to Hammer the majesty of statues of antiquity, and he says that they’re almost daring you to desire them. And Hammer glances up at him in a moment of vulnerability. There’s obvious thematic allusions to the greater story of Call Me by Your Name that this line hints at, the brooding love between the Chalament and Hammer, the bubbling emotions, and the question, “Does the father know?” and it’s all captured in Hammer’s glance. There’s a tension in it, yet also a passive knowledge that love is love is love is love. It’s endearing and empathetic and meaningful. There’s a moment where Chalamet sneaks into Hammer’s bedroom while he is away, and Chalamet puts Hammer’s shorts on his head. It’s a static shot that hangs. It takes its time and lets Chalamet explore within the scene, which leads to a primal performance that embodies the young love the film presents. One of the things that great actors do that good actors don’t do is they embody greater themes and have the ability to manifest them into specific actions. And, since some people want more specific examples and quote unquote scene names on this channel, here’s one for ya, scene name: the last scene. After Oliver goes home to America, Elio is left only with a phone call in which he says, “Elio” into the phone. The pain in his voice illuminates every glance, every tear, every embrace that lead up to that point. This is accentuated in the last shot of the film, in which Elio stares into the fire, merely remembering. At 13 seconds in, visually, the color palette is expressive of the mood of the piece, the warm hues in the foreground that illuminate Elio’s face remind the audience of the summer gone by, a previous era, a memory, while the background is full of cool greys and blues that communicate a cold harshness of the present. The actual performance starts with Elio smiling into the fire, with wet eyes. He’s reminiscing. Basking in the memories. Then, at about 18 seconds in, his expression changes, his glance is downcast and the edges of his mouth are drawn inward, still retaining a slight smile, but is melancholic now. As the music fades in at the 32 second mark, he opens his mouth and bites his lip, reminding himself that the memories are only that: memories. They’re gone. He tries to control his breathing, tries to control his emotions. At 50 seconds, a fly appears, evoking the buggie summer that passed, the faint hand of love caressing his shoulder. He continues biting his lip as his focus moves from the surface of the fire, to within it. Like those visual riddles where you have to somehow look through the image to see what it really is, he’s looking through the fire into a world that’s gone. At a minute and eleven seconds in, his breath shakes, he’s trying to control it but eventually it must burst. He’s accepted it’s over. There’s no hope. This control continues and is expressed through subtle facial movements such as the moving of his jaw, the rubbing and biting of his lips, and eventually his hand reaching to wipe his tear away. At 2 minutes in, he’s despondent. His parents are setting the table, but he is unphased. He is transfixed by the fire and the memories of the previous summer. At 2 and a half minutes in, his breathing becomes faster, he’s trying to expel these unwanted emotions. 3 minutes in, his nostalgic longing has been replaced with an emotional wall. There’s anger where love once was. The shot ends with a look up, to the camera, and a glance over his shoulder. Realizing he can’t sit by the fire and cry all day. He must get up, and move on. This heartbreaking emotional rollercoaster is communicated through one single shot that lets the audience witness his face contort to the will of misery, remembered joy, uncertainty, fitful acceptance, and longing. I’ve seen some buffoons online stating that Elio’s performance was cold and lacking emotional depth, but they’re just plain wrong! Chalamet had to make Elio authentically aloof and cold at times, which is what these buffoons have picked up on, but he also possesses a vulnerability that he only lets out occasionally in the presence of Hammer. Oliver could have been oh so easily performed as the cliche handsome Hollywood macho man stand-in, but Hammer portrays him as a complex human. He switches between that Hollywood persona while in the public eye, to a private tenderness when with Elio that is mesmerizing to watch. A director once told me that acting is reacting, and in this film, it’s engrossing to watch actors **re**act. In high school theater, most actors are caught up with trying to remember their next line they don’t focus on reacting or even acting when they’re not speaking their lines. Throughout the whole film, Elio has put on a brooding persona, he’s been cold, and emotionally shut out, but when he and Oliver are discussing whether it’s better to speak or to die, he reveals a sliver of tenderness. Previously, Oliver has only shown his straight confident self, but in this shot, the audience can see the gears turning in his head - there’s vulnerability, debate, there’s emotion and sacrifice. There’s humanity. In the monologue at the end of the film, the father uses similar techniques as Chalamet in the ending shot to communicate his emotions. He uses everything in his repertoire, including facial animations that are seldom seen - his eyebrows and the arch of his mouth communicate something not entirely whole. Something partially nostalgic and longing, partially hopeful for his son, partially melancholic. He’s letting down his emotional wall just enough for the audience to get a partial glimpse into what lies behind. The words themselves are remarkable, but when performed by Stuhlbarg, they become cinematic magic. On page 289 of Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace writes, “He had at eighteen become exactly as fine a tennis player as he was ever destined to be.” That hits the nail on the head in terms of my acting ability. I’ve pushed and pushed and pushed for years for this thing I’ve been told I love, but ultimately I can sense that I’m just fine. I can see that I’ve improved over the years, with each show gone by, whether on or behind the stage, my abilities have improved ever so slightly, but I know that they’re done improving. There’s a level of self transcendence that I will never reach when performing. I will always hold a piece of me in a character, I will always have that emotional wall up when acting, I will always be just a little to myself will always be me. When I do these analyses, and I critique performances, I can clearly see these issues in my own performances, but I don’t know how to fix them. I can see that I’m merely emoting, but when I’m on stage I don’t know what happens, but I can’t progress beyond emoting. I get too in my head, I get to wrapped up in not being myself I forget to be a character. I can take direction and I can mold my performance, but I can never enhabbit a character. I can say the lines in a way that’s interesting, I can put emotion behind them, but nothing else. I can sing a note, maybe not in my analysis for the Master or mother!, but on stage I can sing a note, but I can’t be someone. I cannot truly act. I’ve realized that I’m fine. I’m a fine actor. And that’s all I’ll ever be. The palpable chemistry between these two actors mitigates the need for campy, “I LOVE YOU SO MUCH” dialogue, instead the audience can **feel** the emotions being thrown back and forth between these performers. \n\nCall Me by Your Name was shot on succulent 35mm film in order to capture the air of freedom summer in Northern Italy invites. In a time when directors and cinematographers shoot on 35mm almost in secrecy, sending it through a digital intermediate to dull the rich colors, add buckets of CGI, only to send the finished product off to cinemas as a DCP, Call Me by Your Name offers a different approach, and basks in the glory that is analogue film. The 35mm captures the sun baked exteriors, and interiors lit by agape windows and open doors so delightfully, that you’d be forgiven for thinking that the lighting was natural. This film was shot during a historic rainstorm, so most of the light the audience sees is not from a ball of gas, but rather some bright bulbs. Though, the cinematographer does retain the lackidazickly scorched mood with these artificial lights, and truly captures the setting, and the mood of the environment. Much like the soundtrack, the cinematography isn’t focused on propelling the audience through scenes, so much as emotionally complimenting the mood of the film as a whole. These shots hang. They’re not long shots in the spielberg sense of having a conventional wide, shot, reverse shot, but all in one shot, rather, here, it’s a static shot that rarely changes, the camera stays still while the actors play inside of it. For instance, There’s a shot of Elio and Oliver sitting on a hillside, the camera is also on the hillside, almost buried in grass, looking at the backs and the sides of the characters. Initially, I thought this was quite a strange way to shoot the scene, there’s a lot of visual muddiness and obtrusiveness to the shot. It’s not clean. But then I realized that the camera is also on the hillside - experiencing the conversation right alongside them. In this film, the audience isn’t an observer, they’re living with the characters in the film. The audience is a character. Call Me by Your Name was breathtaking in its ability to immerse the audience so fully in its sights, sounds, and emotions of an immortal summer romance. The length of shots plays into the structure of the film as a whole as well, the shots hang and linger, they take their time to build a sense of emotion rather than strictly adhering to some sort of arbitrary structure. \n\nCall Me by Your name features one of the oldest stories in the screenwriting book, guy falls in love, fall out of love, and they deal with it. Alone. But, the way in which this film tackles this tactless cliche is what sets it apart from the crowd - by abandoning the three act structure. Each scene doesn’t have a plot point, or an act break, or a reversal, a rising action, or even an antagonist, instead, each scene builds an empathetic bond between the characters in much the same way as The Florida Project. The screenwriter doesn’t include these seemingly innocuous and disconnected moments to advance the plot or to let the audience in on some special secret; the connection between Elio and Oliver is apparent rather quickly, and the plot is the simplest of love stories. Rather, this screenplay sketches a portrait of personal, formative experiences of romance and sexuality. There’s a raw, quiet urgency at play here, bubbling under the surface, that would not have been possible without this unconventional structure. Screenwriter James Ivory stated that his intent was to, “Avoid the crux of a narrative and keep characters at the center.” This leads to emotions and empathy being front and center, rather than flashy plot points and reversals. Another way this film avoids cliche is by the absence of an antagonist. When I tried my incompetent hand at writing a romance, one thing all of the guru bloggers said was there must be a clear antagonist. There must be something keeping your couple apart. Whether it be social forces, other characters, or what have you, there must be an active antagonist for your characters to fight against. There must be conflict. There’s something amusing about the fact that there is no antagonist in this film. No characters are fighting their gay love, everybody’s pretty okay with them being together. Society is more or less fine with it. The only real thing keeping these two apart is time and distance, and this doesn’t come into play until the final minutes of the film. In fact, there’s no conflict in this film. Just two people who want to love each other, and do. This film has been compared with last year’s best picture winner, Moonlight, not only because of its period piece gay romance, but also because of possible oscar chances. But Moonlight had a fairly simplistic structure. It had 3 acts almost literally written on the poster, and had multiple clear antagonists who wanted to smother love. This film, on the other hand, almost basks in this carefree structure - which only heightens the emotional impact when the heart of this film is laid bare. The fact of the matter is, three act scripts are less human. They focus on plot points, and reversals, and page numbers instead of relying on character. The three act structure is a road map for amature writers who can’t make a story move along on their own. All act structures are nothing but arbitrary divisions of action into parts. The greeks had one act in their plays, the Romans had five, modern plays have 2, this is solely because of the need for bathroom breaks. An audience can’t be expected to sit on a stone for 3 hours without getting a bit antsy. The modern equivalent is TV shows, they have 7 acts because of the need for 7 commercial breaks. The writers are almost required to insert something intriguing at the end of each act to lure the audience back after the break. This has nothing to do with story. Aristotle made no allusion to the three act structure in Poetics besides a vague “beginning, middle, and end” which is ill defined it could be taken to mean just about anything. If anything Aristotle talked about a 2 act structure, complication and denouement. And frankly, Poetics shouldn’t be read as gospel. The ramblings of an ancient scholar hastily written down in a way that looks like lecture notes should not be taken as a hollywood guru. Poetics is nothing more than **observations** about popular plays at the time. Story structures of any kind do nothing more than restrict the writer. \n\nThis film is risque. Not risky like a risky Zack Snyder kino, rather sexually explicit. Upon my first viewing I was appalled at how disgusting this film was, how lude its characters were, and how physical intimacy was a stand in for emotional intimacy. I was disappointed that with all the sickness in the world, the last thing we needed was smut in the cinema. Why would I want to drive to a fancy theatre, get all dressed up, pay for a ticket, all to watch this filth. I don’t need that, this indecency should be kept in the bedroom between those acting in it, not everywhere we turn our heads. But then I realized, in a world where sexual power is being used to oppress, this film is the antidote. Call Me by Your Name is about consensual desire, discovery, and a completely un-power-related relationship. This film is a flowing chronicle of summer sunday nights, and missed connections as opposed to non-stop intercourse some folks would lead you to believe it is. It’s about connection, humanity, and saying goodbye. Physical intimacy is just one avenue for the filmmaker to express these themes. And to anyone freaking out over the age difference in the film, Elio is truly beyond his years intellectually and fits like a puzzle piece with Oliver’s cognitive abilities. On that front, they are equals. Plus this is a consensual relationship between a 17 year old and a 24 year old in a place where the age of consent is 14. Get over yourself. There is an emotional freeness in this film that comes from the physical freeness of the characters. There’s a vulnerability here that you don’t normally see from actors that are clothed. \n\nOver the years, I’ve heard many critics and so called critics talk about film as a religious experience - and while I like films, I can even say I love some films - I can confidently say that I have never had a religious experience watching a film. Until now. La La Land came close, but I my naivete was overpowering, it was more astonishment than religious or spiritual. Call Me By Your Name was a religious experience, it was a spiritual awakening, it was soul searchingly picturesque and imperfect. Specifically Michael Stuhlbarg’s monologue with his son. When the camera finally cut to a close up of Stuhlbarg’s face while he delivered one of the most emotionally compelling and affecting monologues I’ve ever seen, I could feel the audience. Everyone was looking at the same thing, engrossed in the same emotion. While the beauty of film is the subjectivity, at the end of the day, the entire audience is taking in the same stimuli and outputting similar but substantially different emotions. A director once told me that the essence of performance is to make the audience breathe at the same time. Theatre and film, when done right, is a transcendental experience, transporting the audience to a time and place unknown, while exchanging emotions with one another. I don’t mean religious in the sense of organized profit oriented, opium for the masses big “R” religion - I mean spiritual. I mean individual. I mean sitting down in a group of strangers and sharing an experience. It’s believing in something bigger than yourself, it’s offering up your emotions - your soul - to the collective. \n\nI can’t wait to view this film in 10 years in a whole other mindset. In a whole other context. That’s the beauty of art. If you press me to say why I loved this film, I can say no more than because it  was it, and I was I. ",

        "text": "Video Form: [https://youtu.be/eTLCE2JRPkY](https://youtu.be/eTLCE2JRPkY)\n\n**Schindler's List — Remembering the Holocaust**\n\nIn the face of such unimaginable evil like the Holocaust, how does one manage to make a true connection with the victims? To understand the scope of this event one must attempt to separate the victims from mere numbers. More than six million Jews were slaughtered and while there are museums, books and pictures to educate people, this fact is incredibly difficult to grasp emotionally. Steven Spielberg changed statistics for faces and names; characters we could get to know and understand. In this way he ensured that viewers would make a personal connection with the characters on screen, to feel their fear and pain. His goal was to tell a story everyone could relate to, in a way no one could ignore. The way to do this was to force the viewer to confront this horror on a personal level. To realize that every victim had a story, loved ones and a life. Spielberg realized that looking at the jews of the Holocaust simply as a group, is just another way to take their humanity once more. In Schindler’s List the victim regains a sense of individuality and uniqueness. Most directors can deliver a history lesson. But it takes a great one to portray what just might be the worst atrocity ever committed in human history in a truthful and emotional fashion. Today we’ll explore the techniques used to make Schindler’s List a personal, relatable story and how a director that was known for directing blockbusters managed to make one of the most heartfelt films of all time.\n\nThe film opens with the lighting of a candle, illuminating the Hebrew prayers, reciting thousands of years of culture. The candle burns steadily throughout and as the prayer diminishes, the candle fades and so does all color. The screen turns to grey, their culture and their people go up in smoke. There is no light left. The grey of the Holocaust begins. A director’s choice to shoot in black and white may run the risk of seeming to show off. However, the use of black and white in Schindler’s List successfully recalls this period in history, while symbolizing the loss of hope and humanity that took place. Spielberg also takes this opportunity to use color to highlight certain key scenes and symbols in the film. The most obvious being the girl in the red coat. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was happening, yet did nothing to stop it. “It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street…” To Schindler, she’s the embodiment of life and innocence. It’s color in a dark, cruel world. She also provides empathy. There’s a saying that’s misattributed to Joseph Stalin that says “One death is a tragedy. One million deaths is a statistic.” While this seems like a cold message to take home, Spielberg understood that the only way to hammer home the terrors of the Holocaust would be to boil the atrocities down to individuals and in this case, a little girl full of color, full of life.\n\nWhile Oskar Schindler starts out as a greedy war profiteer, perhaps the ultimate turning point to become a man willing to sacrifice his fortune in favour of life is when we see the girl again. Her dead body piled with the other corpses serves as a strong reminder of the industrial machine that was the Holocaust. To them, she’s just another number. But to Schindler and to the audience, her death symbolizes the end of hope and innocence. Oskar Schindler serves as a body to move us through the story. It’s safe to assume the genocide of millions of people may have been a statistic to him and even perhaps to the viewer at the beginning of the film. But we all start to care, we start to recognize the individual. Schindler and the audience share these similarities, being unable to stand by and see these people killed. There is a personal connection that’s established with the victims and his relationship with his workers parallels the connection the audience makes with them. Spielberg forces us to get to know these people and care for them. Schindler wants them to survive and so do we.\n\nThere’s a scene in the film where Jews are loaded onto train cars and they tell them to leave their luggage, as it will follow on a separate train. Of course, the luggage never follows them. The piles of belongings symbolize the millions of lives that were lost, as well as the essence of the victims, who were completely stripped of their identity. Besides heavy symbolism, Spielberg also uses parallel editing to highlight the contrast between the cruelty towards the Jews and the comfort of Schindler and the Nazis. Early in the film a Jewish family is forced to leave their luxury apartment and forced to move to the ghetto. As they walk toward the ghetto, the scene cuts to Schindler moving to the very same apartment. As he admires the expensive furniture and decorations, the family arrives in a tiny, dark room in the ghetto. Another effective use of parallel editing is when Schindler celebrates his birthday in a nightclub, holding a party with the Nazis in the middle of the evil surrounding them. The scene is intercut with Amon Goeth, the officer in charge of the Plaszow camp brutally beating his maid Helen in the basement after attempting to seduce her; as well as being split with a wedding taking place at the concentration camp. The contrast between the hope and joy of the celebrations and the brutality of Goeth reflects the harshness of the Holocaust, when even during hopeful situations violence and death were always just around the corner. The use of parallel editing in the film provides a strong contrast between happiness and sadness. A good example of this contrast comes after the evacuation of the ghetto. Soldiers are sent to execute the remaining Jews that may be in hiding and a soldier begins playing the piano. The soldiers are shown as intellectuals, as we could say the film shows what civilized people were capable of doing and how the german people of poets and thinkers was able to transform into a culture of murderers.\n\nThe major strength of the film is how subtle it is in the development of its characters and relationships. Oskar Schindler isn’t a conventional hero in any sense. He was drinker, a womanizer and a con artist. At the beginning of the film he’s a businessman driven by nothing more than greed. There’s no indication of hate nor affection toward his Jewish workers, hiring them at starvation wages. His goal was to become a millionaire. By the end of the film, he ends up broke and wants nothing but for his workers to survive. But his transformation is a slow burn, steadily developing compassion for his workers as he begins to see them as humans deserving of life. Of course, just as in real life his motives are never explained but we can understand them better by taking a look at the people closest to Schindler.\n\nItzhak Stern serves not only as Schindler’s accountant, but also as his conscience. Intelligent and never losing pride in the face of the horrible conditions of the Holocaust, he’s able to influence Schindler’s morality. He takes advantage of his position in the company to save as many Jews as he can by realizing that the factory can become a haven. Stern’s relationship with Oskar Schindler contributes enormously to the decision to save the Jews. And this relationship grows slowly, as Stern begins to respect Schindler as his intentions change.\n\nThe vivid and terrible way the Holocaust is portrayed in the film is led by Amon Goeth, the leader of the concentration camp. He represents the evil of the Nazi Party. Ironically, he and Schindler share many common traits, such as greed and self-centeredness. The difference between them is Goeth never strays into goodness and denies any connection to an individual. Still, Goeth is a complicated character. He’s deeply conflicted since he heavily believes in Nazi ideology and constantly kills Jews for what seems to be his idea of fun; but at the same time he exhibits strong feelings for Helen, his Jewish maid. When Schindler tells him they can never be together, he replies he would be “merciful” to Helen by simply shooting her in the head. This twisted idea of a merciful death embodies his character completely: His inner conflict and deeply entrenched cruelty.\n\nThe film’s message is that one man has the power to save lives, to make a difference, even in the face of an evil like the Holocaust. Spielberg depicts this horror, while carrying the theme of individualism all the way to the end. The final scene is the second one in the film that is fully colored: Schindler’s Jews appear along with their actor counterparts. This serves the purpose of showing that these survivors were real and not just fictional characters, the few who were able to triumph over evil.\n\nIf you’re gonna take something home today, it’s this: Never let your beliefs get in the way of facts. Human beings have a tendency to forget. As time goes by, the survivors and witnesses of this event slowly fade into the pages of history. Schindler’s List is a good reminder of the atrocities that happened not too long ago, demanding that we acknowledge what took place… and reminds us of the 6 Million who made it onto the wrong list.\n\nVideo Form: [https://youtu.be/eTLCE2JRPkY](https://youtu.be/eTLCE2JRPkY)",

        "text": "With good intentions, I'm making the post, since /u/gordzilla15 didn't want to make it.\n\nWe're all familiar with the standard evolution of cinephilia. I feel strangely obligated to add the (often hated) iceberg pictures for the discussion. [Here](http://i.4pcdn.org/tv/1459894553636.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/bY7vA.png) and [this picture](https://i.redd.it/0by3ape4argz.jpg)\n\nThis is different from the \"If you're teaching an Intro to Film course, what are the movies you're going to show the class?\" As the \"Intro to Film\" question implies a history of film, and a dedication to critically thinking about form, style, politics, and philosophy instead of personal growth or personal questioning. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm going to limit myself to 8 films, and I don't think the hypothetical person needs to go to foreign cinema, let alone a wide taste of it. The end point is up to you. ;\n\nThe starting off point is difficult. Even the average person has seen some slightly \"weird\" films (*Eternal Sunshine*), the nominated and critically acclaimed films. I think the first point would be something extremely recognizable but definitely \"out there.\" I would go with *Adaptation.* I was also thinking *Birdman* but that's more recent and more popular, judging by imdb votes. *Adaptation.* has the advantage of making the viewer actively think about movies, rather than the theater which isn't bad, but *Adaptation.* is in a dialogue with itself, and in a dialogue with the viewer, with what they expect, with what they enjoy. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe second film would be slightly more focused on form and style, so I pick *Before Sunrise*. Most people who see it like it, and it's the furthest thing from the blockbuster popcorn movie that's still palatable. \n\nThird and fourth go together, in my mind, since they're in the middle of the road. I choose *The Graduate* and *Memories of Murder*. \n\nMy first three are about relationships in some way. The fourth, as the first foreign film, is probably the biggest leap, but it's not alienating while a black-and-white film might be. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs the path gets to the end, the films should get longer, and the viewer should invest more \"reading\" into the film. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI choose *Network* as the fifth. The 2001 thread, and the comment that inspired this thread, were about pacing, and I think *Network* fits on the continuum.\n\nThe sixth film is where we get to a longer and slower paced film, so I choose *Apocalypse Now*. If you want to expand someone's range, then the first films should mostly be films they heard of, yes? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSeventh film is *Mulhulland Drive*. I think a Lynch should be included since he's well known, but an acquired taste. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI imagine the last film ending at *2001: A Space Odyssey*, since it's what started off the whole thing, and it is slow and abstract. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe average film goer was everyone at a certain point, except for those who don't watch films at all I guess. And I think this is the track people can follow if they even have minimal interest in films.\n\nAlso, I don't think it deserves a thread of its own, since it's relevant to the \"range\" question, but I wanted to hear thoughts on the films that are sort of obscure, well known among cinephiles, that the average person would hear of and even want to watch.\n\n*Salo* is notorious as one of the most controversial and disgusting films, and its place on the Criterion Collection shows its value as an important film. It's not like *A Serbian Film* which most people write off, and say don't watch it. *Salo*, with the major filmmaker Pasolini behind it, is one of those \"old\" foreign films that crosses into mainstream conversations a lot. *Seven Samurai* and *Rashomon* are similar, except I feel like the average person might have heard of *Salo* and is interested in watching it more than anything by Kurosawa, solely because of its horrific content. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Hausu* is similar. It's one of the most popular Criterion films and popular among horror circles. Because it's known as one of the most crazy films to exist, I'm sure it comes up a lot in general film conversations once it goes near that subject. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nConcluding thoughts:\n\nThe main question asks a deeper question: What comprises the average person's taste in film? I mentioned *Eternal Sunshine* before, because I think it's the most popular weird film out there. How far a range of movies, for a friend, a family member, a hypothetical person, do you want that person to react to? \n\nMy films are Adaptation, Before Sunrise, The Graduate, Memories of Murder, Network, Apocalypse Now, Mulhulland Drive, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Does this mean they are just copying themselves? Damien Chazelle's La La Land and Whiplash mostly follow the same themes about being an unsuccessful musician and sacrifice. Does this mean they're just the same movie?\n\nWhen critiquing a directors work do you look at them in context of their other movie or judge it independently?\n\nWhat do you think?

        "text": "I just finished watching Ridley Scott's version of *Hannibal* and I was so disappointed with it.\n\nI know it isn't really fair to expect Scott's work to be the same as Jonathan Demme's, who directed the preceding film in the series (Silence of the Lambs), so I tried to approach it openly and look at it as a new version/interpretation. As jarring as it was when I first saw her, I was easily able to accept Julianne Moore as a different interpretation of Clarice Starling.\n\nThe scenes in Italy felt gorgeously moody and atmospheric.. though that might have more to do with the setting itself. Anthony Hopkins once again reprises his mesmerizing performance of the cannibalistic doctor but Scott's take makes Hannibal's role in the film feel out of character. Giancarlo Giannini was brilliant here - when I first saw him, even before speaking his first dialogue, i felt like I already know so much about his character.\n\nHannibal forcefully kissing Clarice while she was bound and vulnerable felt really out of character and downright rapey. A rude discourtesy that didn't feel like something the doctor would do. Also, Hannibal cutting off his own hand just felt.. off and a little too moralizing.\n\nConsidering this is chronologically the last part of the series, the ending the movie decided to take just felt a lot more displeasing. There is no transformation, no character development, no resolution. It felt like it was blatantly and cynically trying to manipulate you to watch the next film in a series that they were planning to milk.\n\nI know I said comparing the two isn't fair, but after watching it, i feel that Scott's *Hannibal* deserves to receive that.\nIt's such a shame, but looking back to Jonathan Demme's *Silence of The Lambs*.. SotL was such a great film.\nThis sounds a little strange to share but when Clarice was finally sharing to Hannibal her story about the lamb she tried to save, It really hit my heart and brought me to tears. I don't even understand why???\n\nShout out also to some brilliant moments from SotL: Buffalo Bill's dancing with him tucking his junk, and the night-vision scene and its foreshadowing.\n\nI remember some anecdote from Demme's directorial notes about the changes he did to SotL's ending vs the book:\n&gt;\"In the book, Hannibal says goodbye in a letter. That's not cinematic. You had to see the faces. It has to be live.\"\nIn the film: \"Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at an airport in Bimini. He assures her that he does not plan to pursue her and asks her to return the favor, which she says she cannot do. Lecter then hangs up the phone, saying that he is *\"having an old friend for dinner\"*, and starts following a newly arrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd.\" (wiki)\n\nI thought that this was a wonderfully intuitive choice in translating a story to a different medium.\n\nScott's *Hannibal* did a similar scene, with Clarice just reading a letter, and I thought that was boring.\nI know the letter and it's scent was relevant to the plot, but changing this detail to something the audience can actually *directly* experience through their senses, such as maybe a phone call and it's background noise, could've been more immersive than trying to get them to imagine a scent... of a '*whale product*' nonetheless.\nAlso the scent 'experts' just *had* to have giant bottles of perfumes behind them?\n\nI dunno... I'm exhausted.\n\nNow i'm considering if I should still watch the next two films of this series (Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising), since I fear that it would mar the the sublime experience that *Silence of the Lambs* was.",

        "text": "Obviously The Revenant is still a very new film, but to me it brought back a filmmaking style that I thought would never return. The Revenant reminded me more of the films of Sergio Leone, David Lean, and John Ford way more than having a connection with contemporary films. It captures an intense character drama juxtaposed against the power and vastness of nature in a way that movies like Lawrence of Arabia, The Searchers and Apocalypse Now did and I really can't think of a film made in the last 30 years that managed to this.\n\nThere has been a lot of criticism of the film but what made The Revenant stand out to me was the combination of the performances and the visuals, which I don't think can be disputed. Every performance in the film is spot on. Especially the work of Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy who truly become their characters and take on sort of a larger than life power in this epic story. Dicaprio gave probably the most physically effective performance I have seen and it's hard to imagine how difficult this role was. On the he other hand I think Hardy really steals the show with his unique but also realistic performance of a real bastard, but also a very intriguing villain\n\nHowever, the element which really makes the film is the cinematography which to me is really groundbreaking. Like the filmmaking legends that I mentioned earlier, Inarritu and Luzbeski are surprisingly innovative for a film made in 2015. On my last viewing I really paid attention to the camerawork and I found that nearly every shot in the film was special in some way. The movement of the camera around the trees, water, and mountains builds a great appreciation of nature which I believe of the main efforts of the film.  The way they went out there and shot amongst the elements using only natural light was so ambitious and in my opinion it paid off as you can really see the craft and creativity in every scene, a huge difference from all the CGI dependent superhero movies made today where there is no real stakes felt. The infamous bear scene is partially based on the CGI effects but also some amazing ingenuity to the point where I don't really understand how it was done so realistically. The same goes for the opening battle sequences and plenty of other scenes throughout the film. Whether you believe it paid off or not I think you need to appreciate the risks that the fimmakers took here.\n\nMost of the criticisms of the film focused on the simplicity of the story and whether the character motivations hit their mark. I can understand these criticisms but I felt that the movie was meant more to provide an immersive experience which it obviously succeeded in doing. However, I also felt the film was deeper and more emotional than it is being given credit for. First off the hatred between Glass and Fitzgerald feels like it was earned from the beginning of the film and their incredible fight scene at the end was a perfect payoff. People criticized some of the dream scenes for being pretentious but I felt that they weren't trying to convey some deep message but highlight what is keeping Glass going through all of his hardships. Finally, i felt the film's real meaning had something to do with a sort of justice or balance in the natural world. Throughout the film we see characters punished for transgressions and rewarded for acts of kindness and generosity. The idea that \"Revenge is in God's hands\" emphasizes that point as it isn't the characters that decide the fates of others but nature itself which is always creating a sort of balance in the world similar to how the films depicts the contrast of beauty and brutality in nature.",

At it's core, there's so much tension, there's so much visual stimulus that new viewers could easily grab on to but they can't because of the pacing. \n\nWhat does /r/TrueFilm think? Have you had similar thoughts? While we can probably say Tarkovsky and Kurosawa are deep enough in the rabbit hole that they don't need beginner's cuts, do you think certain movies are ripe to have a beginner's cut to pull people deeper into these kinds of films? \n\nDo you think I'm dumb and this is a betrayel of the artist's vision and if they can't handle a slow movie they should put down their iPhone and learn some fucking patience so they can appreciate true artistry?\n\nI'm really curious! \n\nSidenote: Beginner's cut does not mean having a voice-over that explains the plot-points or \"dumbs\" it down.

Her only living relative, her uncle Don Jaime (Fernando Rey), invites her over to his state to spend a few days there. Even though Viridiana is reluctant, for she has met the man only one and considers him to be cold and distant, she agrees after her Mother Superior tells her to accept the invitation. At her uncle’s state she meets and befriends his servants, and slowly starts getting closer to Don Jaime. At the midpoint of the film, after a series of events that shake the perceived normality, Viridiana sets out to help the socially outclassed, wanting to offer them a little “human warmth”. But she’ll soon find out that things aren’t as simple and as black or white as she was thought in the convent.\n\nThere’s a lot to be read in “Viridiana”. To see it merely as an attack on the church is very short-sighted. It does critize the institution and its members, and it is full of symbolism and allegories that lead to such conclusion (just think about the hidden knife in the crucifix), but it does allow for other more varied readings. There is the political angle, for example, by which many scholars note parallels between Don Jaime’s abusive lord-esque figure and Franco himself, though personally I don’t buy into that, since Don Jaime is portrayed rather humanly and sympathetic in spite of his unholy intentions. I’d rather go with a more “universal” interpretation: the film is about humanity, its drives and its decadence. There’s of course a lot of emphasis on faith, religion and politics, but the film, especially in the second half, seems more focused on depicting both the good and bad in humanity, or rather how the good more often than not isn’t enough to mitigate the bad. As critic Michael Wood in his essay “The Human Condition” about this film said: “It is a picture of a society that doesn’t understand its needs.” Under this fall the religious, political and social angles Buñuel expertly tackles.\n\nFull review at: https://breakingthefourthwallsite.wordpress.com/2018/06/23/viridiana-beautiful-blasphemy/",

Sorry, if I sound like an absolutist, because I really am not judging this movie by today's standards. But, all of that is offset by the almost impeccable performances by the actors, especially Anthony Perkins. GOD, He is so good in this movie. It's a bold movie with a bold director and I really enjoyed watching it. Some of the shots and creativity in setting up the environment is magnificent even by today's standards.

I'm not so much talking about a school of thought, as there have been many throughout film criticism, but the character of the critic. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI admit I am limited to reading certain critics, and since the original comment mentioned filmmakers I will too. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've read and watched some Siskel and Ebert, and they engaged in witty repartee, arguing about films and filmmakers, no different than any group of movie buffs. I would say they are experts in the cinema, and have said many interesting things about specific films. I don't think Ebert lacks assertiveness when he gets into arguments, and he definitely made strong claims in his reviews. Anyone can find contentious opinions from Ebert. Any can find controversial comments from any critic, who are outliers on a film's reception. Pauline Kael is a divisive critic who has some of the best writings on films like Bonnie and Clyde and directors like Scorsese and De Palma. Some of her views on cinema are seen as shortsighted as well. Manny Farber, as a painter, approaches films from a unique perspective, and has many imitators. His reviews often elevate films even if he finds them poor. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese American critics appear to be different, and there are plenty of radical opinions between them. The \"character\" of the American critic covers a wide area, not firmly placed in one part. But, they may lack a type of philosophy toward film that others fill. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTruffaut said Americans don't know their cinema very well. Godard has said, in different ways, that cinema is dead. Around 1970, Jean-Pierre Melville thought cinema would only last for another 50 years. These are negative views on cinema, its audiences, and cinema's longevity, and I would say European critics and filmmakers are more likely to have these views than American critics and filmmakers. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMaybe American critics limit themselves because their consumption is dominated by Hollywood, even though any critic or filmmaker in Truffaut's circle are no stranger to Hollywood films. American critics can be as damning as any critic, but they represent the status quo at the same time. I would say one is more likely to find impressive theories from European filmmakers and critics, but there is no shortage of them in America. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the case of filmmakers commenting on each others works, the question takes a turn. Are European, Latin American, and Asian filmmakers more likely to talk about each others works than Americans? It's not exactly wise for American directors to speak of their peers poorly, especially within Hollywood. And when American filmmakers do the opposite, speak positively, it does come across as shallow for some reason. That might be the culture though, which is flooded with words like \"masterpiece\" and all kinds of superlatives. \n\nThese are my first impressions on the topic of assertiveness of critics and filmmakers. Though filmmakers are included in the discussion, it's not the difference of American films vs. non-American films; the topic concerns their comments on films and cinema in general, if they are shallow or weak in any way. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTo repeat, Do you find a difference in how critics, from different countries, express their opinions?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOr in another way, is the character of the American film critic less assertive or not as interesting as a non-American one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDo you value less assertive critics as much as more assertive critics?",

I'm very excited for his venture into the world of *Dune*. \n\nHowever, after watching his filmography, I've started to realize how subtle and unique his filmmaking is, with very few elements crossing over between his films, namely his themes of dread and a [pounding](https://youtu.be/vusD2rsdvk4?t=1m5s) [droning](https://youtu.be/d6hcJOdCTJM?t=2m5s) [score](https://youtu.be/6vThgFwt4Kg?t=59s). But beyond that they're quite different. And yet they're all pretty masterclass. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is if you would consider Denis overtly auteur like a Wes Anderson or Fincher or more subtle and unnoticeable like Spielberg? He seems to benefit a lot from Deakins who works a lot with the Coens, also noticeable for being able to jump genres yet deliver masterful pictures.",

I would go on youtube and google looking for good movies. One day I asked my dad for a movie recomendation and he suggested Cinema Paradiso. I had never heard of the movies and I didn't pay much attention to it.\n\nIt wasn't until last year that I watched Cinema Paradiso for the first time. And it was incredible, the whole movies is incredibly written and directed. From the colorful and vibrant characters to the amazing soundtrack. Cinema Paradiso is a really, really good film. The story is love story but it is told in such a refreshing and deferent way. The movie touches a lot of themes like growing up, nostalgia, letting things go and your past. The whole movie is a love letter to movies. This movie talks about the importance of film and how beautiful and wonderful film truly is. Its a really unique and special movie that is really refreshing to watch. I believe its a story many people can relate and feel connected to. The soundtrack to this movie fits perfectly with the setting and the story, also the soundtrack was composed by Ennio Morricone. \n\nI would describe Cinema Paradiso as funny, charming, gentle and innocent. Cinema Paradiso with out a doubt is my favorite movie. I have never seen a movie that can compare to it. I heavily and seriously recommend this movie. You will not be disappointed.",

        "text": " Hi guys today I wrote an article about the technical feats and influences that went into making Kubo and the Two strings an award winning film. I love the use of gifs and images to display my points so here is a link for visual readers [https://thefilmera.com/2018/06/22/film-frame-friday-kubo-and-the-two-strings/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/06/22/film-frame-friday-kubo-and-the-two-strings/) . Thank you again\n\nReleased on August 19th, 2016 to a wide audience, [*Kubo and the Two Strings* ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4-6qJzeb3A)is an American 3-D stop-motion animation directed and produced by Travis Knight and brought to life by the [Laika Animation Studio.](https://www.laika.com/)\n\nThe film's synopsis reads as follows: \"Young Kubo's (Art Parkinson) peaceful existence comes crashing down when he accidentally summons a vengeful spirit from the past. Now on the run, Kubo joins forces with Monkey (Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Matthew McConaughey) to unlock a secret legacy. Armed with a magical instrument, Kubo must battle the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) and other gods and monsters to save his family and solve the mystery of his fallen father, the greatest samurai warrior the world has ever known.\"\n\nSome would argue there are vastly superior animated films than *Kubo and the Two Strings* released in 2016, and for the most part, I agree. Despite that, *Kubo and the Two Strings* is the animated film I keep coming back to. Not only is it a marvel to watch in motion, but the actual development is fascinating. Now let's get down to the fun stuff!\n\n&gt;Kubo: If you must blink, do it now.\n\nThe main draw of *Kubo and the Two Strings* is no secret. Japanese storytelling is largely ingrained in the film and is the reason this film has some of the best visuals to ever grace 3-D Stop motion. Origami, ink wash painting, and ukiyo-e are the main inspirations for the film, the latter of which I will talk about in detail, but first let's talk about the amazing use of stop motion.\n\nStop motion is an animation technique in which objects are slightly moved physically while being individually photographed. The frames are then played back in a fast motion, making everything come to life. There are 24 frames for every one second of film. To paint a picture of what stop motion is, try to think of a flipbook.\n\nThe use of thousands of facial expressions brought these puppets to life and gave them personality. Of course, there were hardships in making all the set pieces by hand. \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_media-140\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"480\"\\]📷 Stop Motion History\\[/caption\\]The Studio would make history when they built a 16 foot, 400-pound stop-motion figure. This behemoth sets the record for not only the largest but most complicated stop motion puppet ever to be used in a film. Here is a quote on how they managed to move this massive puppet.\n\n&gt;You have this puppet that, because it was so big, we had to develop a piece of technology to support the weight and be able to move it. We made this thing called “the hexapod,” which supported the torso, which is essentially the same kind of thing that you see on a flight simulator or on a virtual reality ride at a theme park. And what it allowed us to do was to support the massive weight of the puppet, but also be able to move it at pretty much any angle. -Travis Knight\n\nTheir hard work was not vain, as *Kubo and the Two Strings* would later be [nominated and win numerous awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accolades_received_by_Kubo_and_the_Two_Strings) for its technical aspects. \n\n### The Art Origami and Ukiyo-e and Its Effect on the Film\n\nOrigami is the art of paper folding. It is often used to make creatures, objects and even characters based on popular media. *Kubo and the Two Strings* is the first 3-D animated film to expand on the concept of origami as not only a visual spectacle but as a plot point as well—Kubo's main power in the film is his ability to bring origami to life.\n\n\\[gallery ids=\"2675,2676\" type=\"rectangular\"\\]\n\nEven the Origami figures were 3-D printed and handmade. \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2677\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"750\"\\]📷 *Kubo and the Two Strings*\\[/caption\\]Ukiyo-e is another form of Japanese influence on the film, and the key factor in how the world *of Kubo and the Two Stri*ngs was shaped. According to[ wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e):\"Ukiyo-e is a genre of Japanese art which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries. Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties; kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica. The term *ukiyo-e* (浮世絵, /u.ki.yo.e/) translates as \"picture\\[s\\] of the floating world.\"\n\nHowever, the look of the film was influenced largely by one woodblock artist specifically: Japanese woodblock print artist [Kiyoshi Saito](https://www.pinterest.com/patjohnstone/kiyoshi-saito/). \\[caption id=\"attachment\\_2688\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1024\"\\]📷 Art by Kyoshi Saito\\[/caption\\]\"Kiyoshi Saito was the key stylistic influence that was the unifying design element throughout the entire movie,\" *Kubo* director and LAIKA President and CEO Travis Knight tells The Creators Project. The artist's influence is evident in every aspect of the film, from the costumes and sets to the framing of the camera. Saito's poetic view of the rich history of rural Japan struck a note with me. \"His artwork was a great place to start in the development of Kubo,\" adds production designer [Nelson Lowry](http://www.laika.com/person.php?id=61). \"Our characters are stylized. The world they travel through needed to support that. During the development process, we started adding some of this texture into set pieces and clothing. Rather than depicting every grain of sand and snowflake, we used a woodblock-like texture across most of the surfaces in the film to imply detail. The technique gave the film a slightly grainy look evocative of Saito's work.\"-From [Creators interview with Travis Knight](https://creators.vice.com/en_au/article/bmyev4/kubo-two-strings-japanese-printmaker-influenced-laika) \n\nsee more at the link at the top of the post. thank you guys for being a great community.

        "text": "I was stuck on this line when Jimmy asks Mr. Hayes \"Why does Marlow keep going up the river?\"\n\nHere the film references James Conrad's book “The Heart of Darkness” The important thing to note for this analysis is as the main character Marlowe is going up the river of the Congo jungle in search of a man named Kurtz who works for a company that profits from the ivory trade. The first thing he sees is how The Company is brutally forcing the natives to work for them and the second thing he notes is how wild and savage both the jungle and the natives are. But he realizes that it’s like looking in a mirror with all the lies stripped away that in our heart there is no difference we are just as savage and cruel as the jungle and its natives as is shown by The Company’s cruel treatment of the natives. This point is further proven when he comes to find out, away from the eyes of society Kurtz’s dark heart has caused him to become a savage crowned as a god over the natives, killing any who dare oppose him.\n\nIn Peter Jackson’s King Kong there are two Islands. Manhattan and Skull Island one a Modern Society the other a Savage Jungle. At least first glance, because just like The Company in “Heart of Darkness” New York is a corrupt place full of people trying to survive not from giant bugs and dinosaurs but from a great depression. One of those men is Carl Denham the man who will do anything for a shot who, much like Kurtz comes face to face with the darkness in his own heart as he goes to the jungle of skull island\n\nThen of course there is this famous line “It was beauty that killed the beast”\n\nIn the 1933 film this line was spoken matter of factly by Denham, stated to the crowd as a proverb to heed. But in the Peter Jackson’s version this line is said by Denham in realization. Not to a crowd but more to himself. What is the realization? We'll get to that at the end. But to understand this first we have to understand the character of Carl Denham. Well in the first one he’s played as an ambitionary filmmaker with a sense of adventure, and Kong is a monster who gets caught up in beauty which leads to his downfall. The beauty gets rescued by the hero of course but even he is given a word of warning about falling for beauty by Denham “Beauty will make even the toughest go soft, think it over” So what’s the message of the original film? “Beautiful women will lead to your downfall?” If it's trying to be something more it doesn’t do a good job. Now back to Denham in the Peter Jackson’s version. It’s essential to realize Carl not Kong is this movie’s villain. Much like Kurtz he escapes the eyes of society and shows his true colors Look at his reaction to Mike dying he inspires his crew to keep filming because they have to show the world what Mike died for, mystery in the world. But then look at his reaction to Herb dying he gives the same cookie cutter speech but with his true motivations tacked to the end “Everyone could have a piece of it for the price of an admissions ticket” Also in the bog scene he appears to be helping Preston but he instead grabs the camera and leaves Preston. Then look at his reaction to this the crew member getting eaten to death. He has this look of wonder and vision. He gets his shot he doesn’t care about the man's life. Now look at his reaction to his camera getting destroyed he mourns for it but not for the lives of his crew or Choy who just died and while Lumpy is fighting with a vengeance for Choy. Denham does the same but for his camera. After realizing all is footage of the mystery of skull island is gone and there will be no ticket sales he devises a way to capture Kong even at the expense of Ann and Jack.\n\nThe reason I like the new Kong character over the ‘33 Kong character is because New Kong played much more sympathetically he is a lonely king powerful and dangerous but beautiful. Some people like Ann can see that beauty, and Ann develops a friendship with Kong. People like Deham can see that beauty too but see one purpose for it not to admire or connect with it but to capture it and sell it. We as humans take something wild and free and puts it in chains. All Kong wanted was a connection, because he was alone. When he breaks out of the chains and we are threatened by the wildness of this beauty that we tried to sell. We kill it.\n\nInterestingly enough The new Denham and the old Denham share the belief that “the love of beauty can lead to your downfall” in the remake and in the old one he believes that Kong’s love for Ann lead to his downfall. In the new one we see that Denham wasn't going to let Skull Island’s ot Kong’s beauty lead to his downfall he was going to do anything to survive the urban jungle.\n\nBut he realizes\n\nIt was Kong’s beauty that kill him, but it was our fault\n\nWe are threatened and fear that which we do not understand, because we have hearts of darkness.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8t2860/a_deeper_look_into_the_concept_of_video_game/",
        "text": "This is a subject which despite (or maybe because of) it's popularity there's never really any insight being provided, no one rarely learns anything, very few put effort in and seems to be a fools wishing well where everyone throws in their two cents and don't give a fuck about what anyone else is saying. But video games, being as they are the fastest growing artistic medium in recent years touching most Western households and outdoing films in terms in income still have a quite averse relationship with other narrative mediums (aside from perhaps superhero comic books). It'd be nice if we could have a slightly different talk about video game adaptation, and where they might go.\n\n**The adaptations relationship with the audience**\n\nAs it stands there hasn't really been a single video game adaptation which the mainstream audience has deemed \"really good\". Though positive comments do exists, they're very often met with an asterix or several opposing comments. The arthouse audience meanwhile has been completely disconnected. So are video gamed adaptions exclusively going to be big budget mainstream films? It's a point which has really been taken for granted, if someone could make a low-key low budget film for an arthouse audience, why make a video game adaptation? Why not write something yourself? And the most important and also most forgotten/ignored question *Is there even material for such a thing?* \n\nThe latter question is for obvious reasons incredibly uncomfortable for many video game fans, in it lies the assumption that there is very little artistic merit or substance in the entire medium. You could of course come up with counterpoints and counterexamples, but then the discussions surrounding potential candidates for a video game adaption wouldn't really exist, or at least look the way it does now. Big Budget is a prerequisite, it can't look cheap. The Box office as well, now that we're well into \"movies as sport teams\" phase is important. Making a small film for a small audience is not even dismissed, it's *never mentioned,* the main idea of the video game adaption rather than being a simple well made little two hour romp you can munch popcorn to, seems to indicaboxte that it needs to be *The Champion of an entire medium.* It has to represent video games, and *prove something.* This is of course never directly stated, but it's not difficult to see the mentality here, there's a genuine need for validation and every single video game adaption \"failure\" is not just a failure for the producers, it's a failure for an entire subculture.\n\n**The adaptation relationship with the source material**\n\nA very often quoted reasoning for why video game adaptations are doomed to fail is peculiar enough to ponder for a moment. *Video games are interactive, which cannot be translated into a non-interactive medium*. The essence of the source material itself is so alien to other mediums that any attempt of transforming it will damage its essence so irreparably that barely any enjoyment can be gathered. It's not looking too bright for game adaptations now, is it? Though it's a very comforting anti-hype anti-advertising mindset. It allows oneself to off-hand dismiss any piece of advertising, marketing or information about an adaption because the very concept of it means it's damaged forever, it's absolutely unsalvageable.\n\nThis is a rather extreme interpretation of an extreme mindset, but it's also something worth thinking about. It's not shoddy scripts, poor directors, confused studio meddling, disastrous productions or bad creative decisions right from the start, it's just something inherent. Nicely, this explains why \"we haven't had a single great video game movie\", but I feel it's also a it simplistic, also not true.\n\nFilms aren't a stranger to adaptations, there are so many films based on books of all types that attempting to categorize or even recognize films based and books and original screenplays is a fools effort. The point of comparison is while there's been both good, bad and middling adaptations based on books, there's also a diversity in the *intent* behind its creation. Some book-to-films genuinely are a studio saying \"this is popular, we can make guarenteed money by turning it into a film\", it's a common well accepted practice at this point. Most bestselling genre authors get the question \"when's the film coming out?\", it's even often used as a measure of success. On the other hand, there are also plenty of creators saying \"I want to adapt this book\" and gets in touch with a production company of their own accord. A passion project, of which the more talented production have a tendency to get acclaim with film enthusiast circles, and the former example get box office result. This whole description very simplified, of course. \n\nWhole point of this is that the latter type of adaptions seem not only very very rare, as mentioned above they seem almost unwanted, or as if the audience is barely aware of such a thing. While artistic merit seems to be one of the main points in the abstract goal of \"mainstream acceptance\", there doesn't seem to be a willingness to pay the costs.\n\n**The adaptions themselves - and looking forward**\n\nWhen judging the best examples of the adaptions in my mind it gets tricky whether they should be labeled failures or not. Silent Hill and Warcraft I did enjoy, flawed films sure but with enough strengths to make them enjoyable to watch. Looking forward to the usual suspects of film adaptions, Uncharted, Bioshock, Last of Us and whatnot I really don't see them rising for the occasion, it's really hard to see a significant jump in quality when the video gamed adaptions are made as they are with the audience expectations that exist. There seems to be an important lack of directors inspired creatively by these games, and despite reading getting less and less popular while playing games is more and more the artistic spot which really gets these passion projects going doesn't seem to be there as much. \n\nGod this turned out to be a buncha ramblin', but there's a lack of respect for artistry when it comes to talking about these film. Box Office and RT score seem to be the only goals in mind (more boring goals are hard to find) so it's not something one can talk about very often.",

That pretty much sucked me out of the movie at that point, made me laugh, and ruined everything before it. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous and the mounting sense of dread had me on the edge of my seat for the first half of the movie and they just kind of threw it out the window in favor of this absurd ending.\n\nPersonally I think they should have just ended the film when he was riding away on the bike and left it ambiguous, and I'd have loved it.\n\nIt got me thinking, what other films were spoiled with too much exposition/spoon feeding the audience or simply a bad scene?",

Just an average person with an average problem.\n\nNow, one could say something like *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* fits this bill.  Steve Carell plays a middle-aged lonely man, and the movie finds himself connecting with his coworkers and building a relationship with a divorced mother.  And I freaking love that movie, and still think it's Judd Apatow's best, but it does admittedly play things a little wacky, a little sitcommish at times, although nothing is exaggerated to the point of taking yourself out of the movie completely.\n\nI'm sort of curious about other movies that maybe play things a little more centered, or quiet.  *Clerks* would actually be one, in that it's about a 23-year-old who's paralyzed with indecision and anxiety about almost every aspect of his life.  And while crazy things happen, it's never *that* unbelievable.  ",

        "text": " Long writeup, was afraid Reddit would break if I posted the whole thing. \n\n#### \n\n#### ON PASSIVITY AND VIETNAM\n\nOne of the first things you learn about writing a screenplay is that a passive protagonist, one who doesn’t drive the action of the story in some way, is no good. You want to watch your protagonist *act*, not *react*. How exciting would Indiana Jones be if he was just along for somebody else’s treasure hunt, never making the choice to raid a temple or save a sidekick? In fact, one of the complaints most frequently levied against *Raiders of the Lost Ark* is that Indiana Jones is simply a spectator of the climax; the Nazis are the engines of their own destruction, and the hero is rendered inert and immobile in their downfall. Now, I don’t necessarily agree with this particular complaint, but in general, there’s something inherently unsatisfying with a character who doesn’t make choices that impact the characters and world around them. We want our heroes to impact the world around them because A) we’re already sitting there watching a movie, we don’t want to watch somebody else who’s watching the action, we want to watch someone who is the engine of the action; and B) it’s comforting to be reminded, on some level, that we are in control in a physical world that responds to our actions. We can drive our own actions, and for the most part, we only have to worry about external challenges. Well, as it turns out, the real world is a little more complicated than that.\n\nTwelve years before people were watching Indy slugging Nazis on the silver screen, they were looking at photos of the butchered bodies of women and children in the village of Son My, South Vietnam. Specifically, they were from the My Lai 4 hamlet, and they were raped, mutilated, and murdered at the hands of US soldiers; the brothers, husbands, sons, and fathers of those back home had inflicted unspeakable, barbaric, atrocities. \"How could our Johnny do such a thing? He always did well in school, and he has such good manners.\" The good people back home couldn’t do anything about the slaughter happening half-way across the globe beyond sit and watch the black and white news broadcasts of unvarnished combat footage, and ask themselves how the human soul could become so degraded, so quickly. What *exactly* would it take for their brothers and sons, so proud and so patriotic, to be reduced to bloodthirsty savages? What would it take for you? That’s a dark line of questioning to pursue, to try and face your darker self. You may have friends, family or power to help you in the physical world, but in your mind? That’s a lonely journey. Captain Willard, just about the most passive protagonist you could burden a film with, makes such a journey in *Apocalypse Now*, and it results in one of the greatest movies of all time.\n\nAt the Cannes film festival in 1979, just years after the end of the Vietnam War, Francis Ford Coppola screened a three-hour work in progress cut of *Apocalypse Now*, about which he infamously stated:\n\n&gt;“My film isn’t about Vietnam. It *is* Vietnam.” - Francis Ford Coppola\n\nOn one level Coppola has a point––a point that becomes particularly elucidated if you watch the film’s sister documentary *Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse*––because the making of the film was representative of the same excesses, hubris and chaos that became hallmarks of the United States’ military intervention in Vietnam. But that’s not what the film is *about*. Yes, the Vietnam War is absolutely crucial to informing its setting and contextualizing the actual themes in a way that would be immediately resonant with its contemporary audience—and this proved a canny artistic choice as the movie, as difficult and strange as it is, earned over $300,000 in five days...at one theater— but what the movie is actually touching on is timeless, and it’s not Vietnam. None of the principal creatives involved in making *Apocalypse Now* actually fought there; not Coppola, not his co-screenwriter John Milius, and not Willard’s actor, Martin Sheen. But they did watch it on TV, and they were forced to confront the darkness in the hearts of America’s soldiers abroad, and the darkness within themselves. Thus the passivity that is so taboo in conventional cinema, especially in a war film, is rendered as the only means to tell the story of *Apocalypse Now*: not of the soldier in Vietnam, but of all of us as we wrestle with the dark recesses of our souls within ourselves.\n\nDespite its box office success and its accumulated critical praise, *Apocalypse Now* remains an elusive film. The first time I watched it as a teenager, I thought I was going to be watching a war movie. Instead, I got…strangeness. I wanted Indiana Jones punching Nazis in the face, not Captain Willard doing whatever it is he’s doing in his underwear. Despite my initial discomfort, however, *Apocalypse Now* lingered. Whether I understood it or not, it affected me deeply; I just wanted to know *why*. I’ve seen it several times since that first viewing, and only on this most recent viewing do I feel I have sussed out a satisfactory reading, and more importantly a method, for myself. I certainly don’t claim to have all the answers (or any answers at all), and it's entirely possible the next time I watch the movie I’ll see something completely different in it. But if you were like I was when I first watched this film and find yourself conflicted and burdened by it, this may set you on a path where you can glean your own meaning from this slippery death-knell of New Hollywood cinema. Shall we begin?\n\n#### THE END\n\nThat’s right, we begin with the end. Not the end of the movie, that’s the beginning. The beginning is the end is the beginning is the end, and so on and so forth. How am I doing? You still with me? Good. Thank you. I promise this will eventually make sense if you keep reading (just not right now, sorry).\n\nWe [open on a verdant jungle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntPHFVWDIqM). Trees swaying in the breeze. Helicopters brush in and out of the frame. A yellow haze wafts in. “The End” by The Doors begins to play. The jungle erupts in a fiery spew of napalm. We’re in Vietnam. Then... Sheen’s sweaty, inverted face dissolves in over the flame? And we’re not in the jungle, we’re in a hotel room? The helicopter is a fan? Where the hell are we? The jungle or the hotel room? Don’t worry, your feelings of disorientation are perfectly natural, and there’s a reasonable answer to your questions: we aren’t in either the jungle or the hotel room. Coppola and his gargantuan editing team comprised of Richard Marks, Walter Murch, Gerald B. Greenberg, and Lisa Fruchman use dissolves––or the superimposition of multiple images on top of one another by means of a chemical process––not for the sake of playfulness, or weirdness for the sake of weirdness, but as a concise and *visual* way of cluing the viewer in to the unique point of view of the film. I may have been a bit misleading when I said we aren’t in either the jungle or the hotel room. We are in the jungle, and we are in the hotel room, but we’re not in *either* of them, we’re in *both* of them –– or rather, we’re in Willard’s internal conception of them. Willard’s head isn’t just there to freak you out but to show you that what he’s seeing is what you’re seeing. There’s a synchronicity between his perspective and the viewers, which is important for understanding why Willard’s passivity works for this movie.\n\nWhat else do we see during this hallucinatory opening coda for the film? We see Willard’s personal effects, a photo of his ex-wife as we later find out, on his nightstand. We see a bottle of alcohol, too. And finally, on the other side of the inebriated form of Willard, we see a pistol in the bed beside him. What do these things tell us about Willard, before he even speaks for himself? He’s tortured. He’s trapped between his life back home on one side, and the violence of war on the other. These were separate worlds for him, but the danger is they’re becoming blurred because as he’s lying there in bed he still sees himself out in the jungle of fire, and the sounds of helicopters bleed into the sound of the fan circling above him. Willard’s conscience is eating away at him, rendering him inert and inward, resorting to alcohol and drugs to cope with his disorientation and moral rot.\n\nIf the imagery didn’t clue you into the point of view of the movie, Willard’s state of mind, and his character’s motivation, then his voice over should do the trick.\n\n&gt;“Every time I think I’m gonna wake up back in the jungle. When I was home after the first tour it was worse. I’d wake up and there’d be nothing.” - Willard\n\nThe fact that there’s voice over at all indicates we are inside Willard’s head, and his hushed delivery reinforces that. The words themselves aren’t just hard-boiled flavor text either, as the crux of Willard’s dilemma is revealed almost immediately. Just as the opening images showed us, Willard's words reveal he thinks he’s still in the jungle, even when he’s back home in the States, ruining his relationship with his wife (notice how he burns the photo with his cigarette). All he can think about is getting back into the jungle, even though it’s a place he hates.\n\n&gt;“When I was here, I wanted to be there. When I was there, all I could think of was getting back into the jungle.” - Willard\n\nWillard doesn’t just want to go back into the jungle, he *needs* to. In fact, he’s been wasting away in that darkened hotel room in Saigon for a week just waiting for a mission. Why does Willard need to go into the jungle? And more importantly, what does the jungle mean? The jungle is tied to Willard’s interior self and his moral torment as – he presently reveals, an assassin for the army.  Willard is trapped between his life at home, there on the nightstand, and his life as a killer, the gun in the bed beside him. And at this point in the film, the gun is closer. Of course, he doesn’t realize any of this yet, but he needs to go into the jungle to face the killer inside of himself, because he needs to confront that darkest self that still haunts him even when he’s home with his wife, and either kill it or let it consume him. In the meantime, his purgatorial torment has rendered him passive and inert. tormented and passive. When the mission Willard’s been waiting for finally arrives, the soldiers have to carry him out of bed.\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/06/21/apocalypse-now-jungles-of-the-mind/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/06/21/apocalypse-now-jungles-of-the-mind/)",

As a preteen and teen comic nerd, I'm living my fantasies right now, although they do take up a large portion of film resources.  Also, many of the films are actually good.  I've yet to see a Marvel movie that's worse than simply average.  And some of them, namely Gunn's Guardians movies and Taika's Thor movie are really very good.  Marvel actually seems like they're getting even more risky as time goes on, instead of the opposite, in that Gunn and Taika are clearly auteurs whose touch can't be denied.  \n\nIn the end, perhaps I've disproven my own conceit, but I'd love to hear arguments and discussions on which movies everyone else would like to see retired or retooled for the time being.",

Sometimes the characters faces are far on the side of the screen, or they're pretty far of from the camera. It feels unbalanced and unfocused - seems like they're often using telephoto lenses.

        "text": "**Non Spoiler - Last paragraph is a quick summary.**\n\nGoing into a horror movie i'm never sure what to expect, and that's why i  love them so much. In the past 10 years however, horror has experienced  somewhat of a struggle. Despite there being a number of very good and  notable horror movies in the past 10 years, consistency has been a real  problem.\n\nMore than anything it feels like  as a horror fan, we get one (or two if we're lucky) good movie(s) per  year. Most recently however, since 2014 i would say, horror has  experienced somewhat of a renaissance. With both *The Babadook*, and *It Follows* releasing in 2014, as well as both *Raw* and *Don't Breathe*  in 2016, i was more than happy to see something refreshingly jaunting  coming out of the horror genre with these movies, and for the first time  in years i felt excited about what was on offer for me in theatres.\n\n2017 had notable horrors such as *It*, *Gerald's Game*, and *Mother!* not to mention Jordan Peele's wildly succesful mystery thriller/horror *Get Out*  which dealt with many prominent social issues, whilst keeping the  audience totally gripped and entranced by the dynamic screenplay.\n\nSo heading into 2018 i was more than excited. Especially when John Krasinki's *A Quiet Place*  dropped and left myself, as well as many others, completely shook. The  deafeningly monotone movie, with splashes of love and togetherness,  which accentuated the characters and the emotions which the audience is  made to possess for them, was an absolute treat. And i firmly believed  that after seeing that movie, nothing could possibly top it. How wrong i  was.\n\nDespite my spike in enthusiasm  regarding the release of horror movies in the past few years, i had  mixed feelings about Hereditary. On one hand i wanted to believe i would  love it for what i had seen in the trailers and what i had heard. And  on the other hand i felt like part of me could end up hating it if it  got lost in itself or if it became too generic and predictable. What i  got was completely unexpected. Hereditary in many respects is a simple  horror movie. Many of its shots are borrowed from other movies, and its  plot at the foundation is also similar to many succesful horror movies  that have been released across the past 10 years. However what seperates  it is the complexity of the story beyond the foundation. From the  dangerously complex characters, to the witty foreshadowing, and the  frantic yet completely sluggish pace of the movie which is hard to  describe, Hereditary is a horror movie that is more than a horror movie.  It is a painfully exhausting experience that leaves you tired yet in  awe.\n\n**Going  into a horror movie i'm never sure what to expect, and that's why i  love them so much. In the past 10 years however, what i have discovered  is that the most common expectation when leaving a horror, is for me to  be wide awake with my heart racing, with hundreds of thoughts running  around in my head.  What i got with hereditary however was something i  had never experienced before. Upon leaving the cinema i felt pure dread,  and exhaustion. The movie is completely exhilerating, and drains you  mentally, emotionally, and even physically. It makes you feel every  ounce of grief and pain, and essentially aids you in feeling the pain of  the characters in the movie. It is an experience that i will never forget.**\n\n**(Already posted this on /**r/Flicks **but a user suggested slapping it in here. Interested in hearing more opinions on it so why not.)**",

Human consciousness continues, but in a different direction.\n\nSo I think this movie is saying that the future of humankind is not HAL-like. It is not arrogant and hyper-intellectual, and it isn't technological.",

        "text": "Back in the 1930s and 40s, as the studio system and the Hays code were in their peaks, Frank Capra was one of the most important directors in Hollywood. He helmed such classics like “It Happened One Night” (1934), “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” (1939) and “It’s a Wonderful Life” (1946). His films have become milestones of american cinema, always blended in with a heartfelt story and clever humour. In 1944 he released “Arsenic and Old Lace”, today somewhat lesser known than the previously mentioned titles, and yet still considered an undisputable classic for those who know it. Based on a classic Broadway play by the same name and starring Cary Grant, the film is a clear example of how classy and utterly funny comedies at the time could be.\n\n“Arsenic and Old Lace” tells the tale of the Brewster family, who descended from the Mayflower and are currently located in New York. Virtually every member is considerably crazy: Teddy (John Alexander) fancies himself to be Theodor Roosevelt, the long lost Jonathan comes back home followed by the law and with a few crimes under his belt, and aunts Abby and Martha (Josephine Hull and Jean Adair, respectively) have a very sneaky and secretive habit that has to do with the basement. The only apparently sane one is Mortimer (Cary Grant), who is about to get married with Elaine (Priscilla Lane), but he’s worried his family’s troubled genes will come back to haunt him. About 80% of the film takes place in the living room of the Brewster house, and conflict arises as Martimer slowly begins to realize his family members’ dark secrets. Also, another character that needs to get mentioned is Dr. Einstein (yes, really), played by Peter Lorre, who accompanies Jonathan to his childhood home.\n\nFull review at: https://breakingthefourthwallsite.wordpress.com/2018/06/20/arsenic-and-old-lace-the-dark-humour-of-an-unconventional-family/",

Maybe something you didn't notice the 1st time through the movie or you had to have someone point it out to you. Something that just makes you love film even more.\n\nRecent example for me:\n\nI was just listening to the podcast The Cine-Files and they were breaking down the movie Die Hard.\n\nBeethoven's Ode to Joy is playing in a very subtle way throughout the movie. The initial versions of it are always a little dissident. It is used with the arrival of the \"bad guys\" in the movie. Always a little off and not right.... until the big pay off when they get into the safe and the joyous version plays.\n\n\\-A string quartet is playing it when Hans and his group crash the cocktail party.\n\n\\-When Hans exits the Pacific Courier truck and enters Nakatomi Plaza is is played with dark tones.\n\n\\-Theo whistles it as he takes control of the building's tech hub.\n\n\\-Hans is humming it in the elevator with Takagi .\n\n\\-Finally the full uplifting version plays when they break open the safe.\n\nThis blew me away because is is such a subtle thing for an Action movie to do. I think it is what Hollywood misses when it tries to make big action blockbusters. Just the little things that round out a movie and make it more than just explosions.",

        "text": "Fight club is in my opinion David Fincher's greatest work, and a personal favourite. However, i have noticed that many seem to misinterpret the films message in particular its portrayal of the character of tyler Durden.\n\nAfter seeing many pieces of fan created art/imagery Ex: \"Tyler Durden's 13 quotes to make you truly free\" \"The genius of Tyler Durden's philosophy.\" Or other quotes from the film attached to ironically an innumerable variety of products, as well as written and video analysis pieces. \n\nTo me it seems that many regard Tyler Durden (to be clear i am referring to Brad Pitt, not Edward Norton.)as an inspiring, and insightful character, and view his actions as both justified, and worthy of praise.\n\nThis truly confuses me and i wonder if i even saw the same film as these people. To me the film clearly uses Durden as a counter point of extremes to the materialistic life led by the narrator. Both were detrimental in their own ways. Yes the life lived based only on material possessions and capital provides no long lasting happiness. But neither did the life led as Tyler Durden. Again the lives of the narrator and Durden act as a symbolic sort of ying and yang showing the dangers of living with no consequences and living for no good reason.\n\nThe film purposefully draws similarities between Durden and the corporations that he so detests, highlighting his flawed philosophy. He cares as little about human life as the faceless corporations that the narrator terrorises. As shown after the death of Bob. Seeing his death as just a means to an end. \"you make an omelette you gotta break sone eggs.\" Or how about how he turns his once equal members of fight club into subservient, mindless drones, following orders without thought or questioning authority. Tyler literally strips the men of their identities, shaving their hair, removing their names, and having them act as slaves as he repeats orders via microphone. All of these seemingly what the narrator hated about being another part of a consumerist system. \n\nBy the end of the film the narrator has conquered both extremes, destroyed Tyler Durden, and parts of a consumer focused society. And has found something truly worth living for.\n\nDoes anyone agree with me, or am i forcing my own interpretation onto others? ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/8sa667/jurassic_world_fallen_kingdom_misses_the_charm/",
        "text": "For a video version of this review, see here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suNFZxhFqHk\n\nSeeing Jurassic World on the weekend was the worst cinema experience I’ve ever had in my life. I know many places and people have had it worse, but where I live people are really civil. This day was a nightmare though. For starters, as soon as the film started I found myself needing a piss, but didn’t want to miss anything so I stayed in my seat and by the time the credits started rolling my bladder was in genuine danger of popping like a balloon to be the day’s best jump scare. \n\nThroughout this though, I had the geeza behind me kicking my chair every time he crossed his legs, which was about every half a second, a guy constantly rustling his popcorn bag so loud like he was trying to wake the dead, a middle aged couple a few rows away yapping away constantly, but the worst was this kid, I’m guessing around 5 years old, moaning, screaming, laughing, and running up and down my isle and rocking chairs back and forward with his parents blissfully watching the film without a care in the world. It was really rude. There were some dialogue scenes were I did miss what people had said because of the kid’s noise. I can understand it if you want to enjoy a dinosaur film with your family, I must’ve been about 5 when I first saw Jurassic Park but you can bet my folks would unsheathe their swords and spears if I made a racket in the cinema. This couple didn’t give two hoots, and the stuards came very close to telling them to leave. On top of all this, I didn’t even want to see Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom anyway, I only went because the Mrs wanted to see it, and after all that I turned to her and asked “Did you like it?” and she said “No, it was crap!” \n\nAnyway, none of these catastrophizes can be attributed to the movie itself. I did my best to focus my attention on the big screen in front of me. I’m not a big fan of the first Jurassic World. Spielberg’s original is a classic, a gamechanger, I’ve got a soft spot for the second, the third I can do without but the fourth movie was the first one that I thought to myself, this doesn’t even feel like a Jurassic Park movie. So I didn’t have the highest of expectations going into this one.\n\nIf you’ve seen the trailers you pretty much know the story. A volcano is erupting which will kill off all the dinosaurs that are still alive after the events of the last movie, and an expedition which includes returning characters played by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard is sent to rescue them in what is essentially The Lost World on steroids. But then it turns out that it wasn’t really a rescue mission at all, and the shady folks that orcistrated the whole thing are in fact selling off the dinosaurs to rich billionaires and warmongers. Pratt and Howard are joined by two hipsters and together they form our group of pretty bland and colourless protagonists. I’m starting to really question Chris Pratt’s ability. He’s no Pacino of course but I did think he was quite charismatic and likable in Guardians of the Galaxy but the more I see of him the more I feel he is incapable of carrying a blockbuster. I was also quite surprised at the treatment of Howard’s character. She was largely at fault for the hullabaloo that went on in Jurassic World which caused loads of deaths and shut down the park and yet there is no repercussion for her actions and negligence. A stab at redemption is mentioned but she has essentially gone from inept, emotionless, vulture-like businesswoman who played a part in a massive catastrophe to being the lovable sidekick. In general though, the characters felt less like people and more like vehicles to move the movie from one place to another.\n\nI was quite disappointed with the special effects in the film, which has always been one of my pet-peeves with recent mainstream movies in general. It wasn’t that they were sci-fi channel level horrendous, it’s just that for the most part the effects are cookie-cutter standard mediocre Hollywood CGI blah. The special effects are completely interchangeable with the 10s of other crappy effects driven cash grabs that Hollywood shits out every year. And that wouldn’t be a problem if this was a Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson vehicle but this is Jurassic Park, the franchise, or at least the film, that was one of the great pioneers of movie special effects in the modern age. The animatronics and puppets had the legendary Stan Winston behind them, the CGI usage was minimal, delicate and restrained, the scenes were properly storyboarded and well thought out, and a wholly creative director in his prime was behind the camera. The Lost World’s effects were equally stupendous, there was a noticeable but slight dip with JP3, and then Jurassic World was released with some effects genuinely looking like they hadn’t been completed. Fallen Kingdom continues this sad but steady decline with really poor digitally rendered dinosaurs, and practical effects enhanced and coated in so much CGI and colour correction that they look CGI anyway. And it wasn’t even the dinosaurs – trees, mountains, dust, fire all rendered through a computer that really gave the film a stale, sanitized feel. It feels as whole thing was shot on two sets, one with a massive green screen and a couple of plastic hedges for the scenes set in the island, and the second with a couple of corridors and rooms for the mansion, despite the fact that they went to Hawaii to make the film. \n\nCredit where it’s due, the film’s centrepiece, the IndoRaptor, looked great, it really did. The design was great and it looked real, it looked tangible, like it was there, it was looking at you, and it could get you. But I don’t know whether they blew their entire budget on the creature or what, because none of the other dinosaurs looked good and quite frankly I’m bored of complaining of shit CGI and special effects in films. It doesn’t mean I’m gonna accept it, and I do understand why a lot of people don’t have a problem with it and see guys like me as nitpickers. To enjoy a good old-fashioned, turn-your-brain off blockbusters, people want different things. Some people want absolutely no politics, no message. Others want the good guys to always win. For me, a minimum requirement is that the effects look tangible, it looks like the dinosaurs are really there moving around. If it doesn’t look like they’re there, I can’t get invested, I can’t get excited during a chase sequence or a hunt for survival, I just can’t even if I try. The effects don’t even need to be good, I’ve seen a lot of 80’s and 90’s films with practical effects where the effects were rubbish, it’s that they need to look like they’re actually there. And aside from the IndoRaptor, Fallen Kingdom fails big time. \n\nThere’s loads of problems with the dinosaurs in this movie. First of all, there’s too many of them. There’s no sense of wonder like the build up to the Brachiosaurus in the original, no sense of trepidation like in the jungle in The Lost World – Fallen Kingdom just grabs every dinosaur possible and throws as much as it can in your face. There’s literally dinosaurs tumbling over each other and squeezing themselves into every possible frame. I can’t believe they managed to make dinosaur boring and saturated. D’you remember the complaints about the star wars prequels that everyone kept on whipping out their lightsabres every two minutes? Fallen Kingdom does something similar with the prehistoric beasts, shoving them everywhere possible like some nepotistic school play teacher pushing his kid to the front of the stage. \n\nAnother direction this movie and its predecessor went with, in regards to the dinosaurs, is that they are like characters now. What happened to the animals that eat, shit and sleep, the ones that attached only if they felt threatened or were hungry? When Fallen Kingdom isn’t treating some dinosaurs like crazy monsters addicted to murder, others are individualised to the point that you’re wondering whether this isn’t an adaption of my first dinosaur. The Tyrannosaurus Rex is like an old family friend, a cousin that pops around on special occasions, and bites baddies in a due ex machina again and again, with the film makers clearly scared to kill her off lest fans riot. The raptor blue is another offender, coming off less as an animal bred in captivity but more of a recurring soap opera character. And what’s with the IndoRaptor pretending to be asleep, opening his eyes every couple of seconds with a shit-eating grin on his face when one of the mercenaries turns around, like a bloody pantomime villain. What is all this? They don’t move or act like animals any more, and are never shown in an environment where they are just being animals. The closing shot of The Lost World was always one of my favourite scenes in the franchise, when you see the two T Rex’s chilling with their young, the Stegosaurus herd grazing and ambling forward, a couple of other dinos here and there doing their thing. Nature in perfect balance. Such a scene could not exist in today’s Jurassic Park movies – the T Rex’s would have probably jumped on the Stegos, hacking and snapping their jaws with Stegs whipping his tail back and forth in rage. \n\nIt’s too much. It’s too much crash bang wallop and I tried really hard but I just couldn’t care about anything going on on the island. Spielberg made a cup of water and the sound of footsteps more exciting than anything in Fallen Kingdom. The Dino run could have potentially been one of the great adventure scenes, Indiana Jones running away from the boulder, ET flying across the moon, instead it just looks like a pixilated mess. The second half of the movie, though many plot elements were contrived like how a dinosaur containment facility was built in a guy’s basement without his knowledge the introduction of some crazy subplots like cloned humans, was a lot better because they scaled everything down. Everything was suddenly a lot more relatable and realistic. You’re stuck in a mansion, there’s a dino in there. You’ve got to get out and make sure he doesn’t. It was very simple and by far and away contained some of the film’s better scenes. \n\nFor the most part though the movie just shoves too much in your face. It leaves nothing to imagination, nothing to ponder. I’ll give you an example, there’s a scene where they show an Allosaurus, my personal favourite dinosaur, and though it was quite big a character mentions that it is still a juvenile. So I started thinking “Hmm, I wonder what it looks like as an adult. I wonder how big it grows, what it mainly uses for attach, what it’s hunting style is etc etc” That was the only scene where the film even momentarily stimulated my brain into thinking, or wondering. \n\nI probably enjoyed it a little more than the last film, but Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom didn’t do it for me. It felt quite interchangeable with all these other mediocre effects-driven blockbuster. It lacks the charm of the Jurassic Park movies, it wasn’t effective enough in its louder brash scenes and didn’t have any room whatsoever for the quieter, rich scenes that really elevate a movie like the silent helicopter ride home in the original. I give it a 5.5 out of 10.  \n\nP.S. how about that auction, huh? In a world where footballers are moving teams for £200m, a living, breathing dinosaur clone only costs $10m.\n",

        "text": "I'm a big fan of the late Milos Forman's *Amadeus*, and you may know that there were two cuts released officially.\n\nThe original theatrical cut (2 hours, 40 minutes) was released on DVD (but never scanned into HD); the longer director's cut (3 hours) was released on DVD and later Blu-Ray, and is perhaps most known for featuring Mrs. Mozart's bare chest (although this is not the only scene added to the longer version).\n\nBetween the two, despite the better picture quality of the Director's Cut, I prefer the original version. Why? As Emperor Joseph says, \"Too Many Notes.\" Although the Salieri-Constanze scene can complicate the character of Salieri and his moral compass (which I have mixed feelings about --- I find Salieri more of a rootable-for underdog in the original, which I enjoy), the other scenes---where Mozart goes to teach the young Schlumberg daughter with the yipping dogs, begs Salieri for money and then begs Herr Schlumberg for money---seem to sour the movie for me, as they seem to be truly extraneous and frankly a bit of an annoying change of pace (especially as they are not fully underscored with Mozart's genius music). On top of this, the slight modifications (one or two extra lines) in Salieri's monologues throws me off a bit, although this is more because I saw the theatrical cut first and am not used to the particular shot --- a first-time viewer of the Director's Cut would be getting no better or worse an experience by watching these scenes.\n\nIn the Director's cut blu-ray, there is one audio glitch as well, which bothers me slightly: the woman who says \"by Händel\" at the party now says \"bändel,\" with just one slight moment of the audio cut off. This is more of a technical glitch than a filmmaking decision, of course. \n\nThere is indeed a fan project to \"restore\" the original cut by using the director's cut; while I can't tell you where to find it online, I will say that it's sufficiently sloppy that I prefer to simply watch my rip from the original two-sided DVD release (put together into one file).\n\nRecently, I was online and saw a peculiar version of the movie: https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/077411-000-A/la-ferme-des-animaux/ (this is only available for the next week or so, and only in France and Germany, I believe); this is, as indicated by the HD scan, as well as the opening and closing credits (and the fact that it uses the Director's Cut blu-ray German and French dubs), the Director's Cut; however, it is then recut to exclude all the parts that are not in the original theatrical release. The issue is this: the Director's Cut is not a perfect superset of the original release, and there appears to be about 10 minutes of footage that is cut out during the film (nothing plot important, from a quick skim, nor any seeming censorship of vulgarity, but it is around 10 minutes shorter than the original cut). I will need to watch this version more in-depth to report on the differences, but it's interesting that the Arte channel apparently undertook their own \"reconstruction\"/recutting project.\n\nSo what are your thoughts? Which cut do you prefer, and why?\n\nEdit: the link was actually https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/041207-000-A/amadeus/, whoops",

Visitor Q came into my work on dvd, and I decided to borrow it and give it a watch.\n\nOverall, I thought it was good. Obviously if you can get past the disturbing subject matter, I personally think there is an interesting film in there. It makes interesting points about how society, and interpersonal relationships have changed with home video cameras.\n\nI haven’t been able to dig into it much beyond that observation, or read any reviews so I’m curious what some of you think and how you interpret the film/specific moments in the film.

        "text": "I'll start it saying that it is not a completely positive critic, au contraire, it is mostly negative. Anyway, before everything starts, I want to talk about her. I don't want to disrespect a great talented director like Chantal Akerman, and I understand that after her departure talking about her work could be seen as a touchy subject; if not for everyone, at least for me, because this is not the first of her movies I watched. Before Jeanne Dielman there was \"La folie Almayer\" that I loved for the intense shots and the great direction of the main character, a real talent on doing so that I've seen manifested also in \"Tomorrow we Move\", one of the most beautiful and at the same time artistic comedies I've ever seen. Saying so I want to demonstrate that there's not hate towards her on this post, and to prove it I showed how much I esteem her, despite even the conflictual relation between me and her movies, relation particularly regarding the one I'm going to write down right now, and  \"No Home Movie\", but that, even though the similarities between the two of them, it's another and different journey.   \n\nSo... I'm not a guy easy to dishearten, I've some sort of familiarity with long and slow movies, so it's hard to bore me, but, and it's hard to say that for me, I found out this movie as a really boring and monotonous one, a common critic I know, but I bet that this was something wanted from the director. She wanted to break rules not over the technics of a movie but on the real way a movie is conceived, and somehow she did it, but with a contestably disgusting film. I'll assume that art is not only about \"breaking rules\", it'll be too easy if it really is like this. Anyway, yes, you can follow in details the life of a mother, focusing mostly on the ordinary things of life, make this routine became a little by little, in an hardly perceivable way, more and more chaotic with a climax of the events till an absolute decline and a brutal ending. You can do this, for sure, but you'll just get a humdrum and repetitive movie, and in the case of Jeanne Dielman, a movie with horrible and anaesthetic shots, with a rare variation (this intend not only in the cinematography), witch an incapability of the director of giving emphasis to the scenes that deserves it, and give moments that really involve the viewers their right weight (a sort of break from the events of the movies), with a script, or better, with an absence of a script, and with ridiculous dialogues, with a direction focused only on irrelevant things, and again incapable of constructing a (and I'm becoming myself repetitive) diversificated and contrasted image, and, at last with actors that are not acting and that are not directed, even tough the main character is a valuable actress, we see her completely wasted in this film. The last point could be contestable being her a semi documentarist, and be part her mannerism, but this isn't a documentary, or at least, not at all. To shorten, this movie denotes serious practical lacks, and all of it exists by the directors will.  \n\nBut could a movie like this be framed in the history of cinema? and more important, can we really call this movie a piece of art? Well, some may, and some may not, and I'm on this last side. Because art is something difficult to objectively (when it's possible to do so) recognize, perceive, address and finally, enjoy. Is something more personal, and there's no doubt about it, we can imagine a sort of line that usually divides artistic works and not artistic works, sometimes thick and other times thin, but when it comes to this movie, it take the shape of a questioning point. In a IMDB review a guy paired this movie with Tarr's Turin's Horse, and well, I think it's not really the case, because \"The Turin Horse\" is freed of all the faults of Jeanne Dielman, but thinking, how can I, or everybody else, determinate the depth of the line I talked before between these two works, well, that's the real question. Before talking about this I think it's better to talk about the positive notes of Jeanne Dielman. In this post essentially I'm criticizing the realization of this movie, but I really praise it, and I praise even more its director, for how she turned upside down the concept of movie, for how she changed the process that hides behind the conceiving of a movie, a something really bad realized in this movie in a material way, but of an incredible importance, specially if it's the 1975 and there are no traces of something similar before it. Call her a pioneer isn't enough, she inspired a plethora of director with this work, and I'm questioning myself if a work like the already mentioned Turin's horse could have even existed without Jeanne. Surely yes, but it wouldn't have been the same it is now for sure. This way of think could fit also for other movies, like, for example, \"From what was before\", a movie with a slow declining climax  that i immediately paired with the one in Akerman's work. I could go on for ages talking about how much a so badly realized movie changed the concept of cinema making examples with even more recent movies. For me \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 Commerce Quay, 1080 Brussels\" it's not art by itself, but instead a form of art for what is became trough the years, an art not affecting the work but what the work leaves behind it, that's the thickness I give to this \"art/noart-line\". Artistic in his heritage, and that is something incredible. ",
