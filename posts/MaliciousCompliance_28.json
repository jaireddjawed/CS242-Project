        "text": "I‚Äôm not positive this belongs here, but another story I read was so similar to mine I had to post.\n\nI‚Äôve been working for a company doing caregiving for disabled individuals for years. From day one I would work anywhere from 50-100 hours a week. I basically lived out of my car and didn‚Äôt see home for days at a time. I tried to cut back a few times but the company always did great at guilt tripping me into doing the crazy hours again. \n\nWell this year everything was changing due to some Medicare stuff being changed. They used to pay people to sleep overnight, now they‚Äôve taken that away from a lot of settings, and in other settings, they‚Äôve decided to decrease the pay from $14 an hour to $9 an hour for 8 hours overnight. Not really a big deal for me, I don‚Äôt have to have a job, I work because I don‚Äôt like staying home all day without talking to people so the pay isn‚Äôt important. What is important to me, is that my supervisors don‚Äôt f*ck with me. \nCue the story villain. A supervisor (not my direct supervisor because most of my hours are through two settings she is not in charge of. The settings I work in mostly are with high maintenance guardians) started out the year by sending a mail to a bunch of people telling them they have to show up for a meeting so they could all be mass trained on everyone in an apartment building. I did not get this mail. They are mass training because overnights are now going to be awake overnights, and the number of staff in the building overnight are going to be cut from 7 to 2 so everyone who does overnights needs to know how to work with everyone. I ask if I need to be there and am told ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù Cool. Meeting date comes and goes with her dodging each time I ask if I need to be there. By this point, I know my 2 regularly scheduled overnights a month in that building are being taken away. That‚Äôs fine by me, but every time I inquire about it I just get told the same thing ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know when I know‚Äù or just ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù I even let her know that it‚Äôs not a big deal if it is, I work in a setting with a lot of demand and get a lot of overtime from it, but I would like to know if I need to cancel my regular morning sitter for that day, they insist that we‚Äôll be given ample notice. \n\nCut to the last week of May. I‚Äôve gotten some news about a medical situation which means I need to cut back on my schedule and not work during certain days of the week because I will have doctors appts to attend weekly. So I call the supervisor who, I‚Äôm a funny twist of fate IS now my supervisor because the company has been losing supervisors left and right. She does not want to be the supervisor because the guardian is notorious for being difficult and firing staff. I tell them that I‚Äôll keep my 32 hours I get weekly by doing weekends but my schedule during the week needs to be open so I can schedule appts. I let the supervisor know that I will be available to work during the week still but it will have to be in an unofficial schedule capacity, I‚Äôll be picking up shifts rather than being scheduled for them. That‚Äôs not super unusual because it‚Äôs basically what I‚Äôm doing already, I‚Äôm just cutting out the regular overnight that I knew I would be losing eventually anyways. \n\nThe response by the supervisor was super understanding. She even told me that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal because that shift I had was being eliminated the following week anyways. I was interested in hearing that because they always said they would let us know when they knew but also insisted that they would be giving us at least a month notice so they could change our schedules around and find everyone new hours. So she confirmed that she‚Äôd still be able to count on me picking up shifts in the high maintenance setting I normally do since she‚Äôs in charge of it now. I replied ‚Äúsure thing, I‚Äôll let you know.‚Äù\n\nI haven‚Äôt picked up an extra shift beyond my regular 32 hours since. I‚Äôve gotten to see the messages she sends to my work BFF asking why I don‚Äôt answer when she calls and why I won‚Äôt pick up any shifts for her. She‚Äôs had another supervisor call me to ask me if I would talk to her and I say okay but if this is about picking up shifts, I already told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let her know.‚Äù \n\nSo each time she emails or texts asking about picking up a shift I answer the same way. \n\nShe‚Äôs basically living at work during the evenings and overnights and then running in to do her regular office hours during the day. The supervisors doesn‚Äôt understand why I don‚Äôt want extra hours anymore especially when I just bought a brand new vehicle. Guess they never believed me when I told them I only worked to get out of the house.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ",

        "text": "This is kind of a tiny thing but I still feel like it counts.\n\n\nSo I am asexual, and as such I have a black ring on my right middle finger as a little symbol. I'm personally very fond of jewelry, and I regularly wear bracelets and a chain necklace. This extends to rings as well. I wear a ring on each hand fairly often, and this time was no exception. I had a cheap stainless steel ring on my left hand. I wear it there to balance out the amount of jewelry I wear on either arm.(I do one ring and one bracelet usually.)\n\nAnyway I was wearing my rings same as always, and I was in the car with my mother. She doesn't know about me being ace, or that I never plan to get married since I'm also aro. Well she glances over and her vision just Zeroes In on my left hand, specifically my ring finger. She immediately decides that this won't do.\n\n\"Son, you know what that finger is for, right?\"\n\n\"Which finger?\"\n\n\"Your left ring finger.\"\n\n\"...yes mother.\"\n\n\"That's your wedding finger. You should only wear a wedding band there. That's what that means and so you should move that ring.\"\n\n\"I'm aware what it means. I am Deliberately disregarding it.\"\n\n\"Well you should put it on another finger. You don't want anyone to get a wrong idea...\"\n\nWhat wrong idea? I'm aro/ace. I'm NOT gonna get married. That's not a thing I'm looking for. I am *off the market*. She doesn't know that I'm ace, but quite frankly I'm not bothered by people thinking I'm not available.\n\nAnyway I continue to tell her I don't care what they think, but she continues to insist I move it.\n\n\"You should be saving that finger for your wedding band.\"\n\nAt this point I'm starting to get an idea to get her off my back. You see my asexual ring... I bought the one I did because it looked nice and it is tungsten carbide, which is really hard to scratch. It was intended for extended wear. You know what else is intended for extended wear? Wedding bands. It hadn't been the intent in buying it, but my asexual ring was actually a tungsten carbide wedding band. I wound up deciding on a wedding band when I bought it so it wouldn't have any sharp edges and would be comfortable for a long time.  This would serve my purposes nicely.\n\n\nSo after the umpteenth time she brings it up in the last ten minutes I go \"ugh, *fine*.\" And slip my stainless ring off of my wedding finger. I move it to my right ring finger. . . And immediately take my asexual ring off my right middle finger and move it to my left ring finger. When she gets after me about it I simply reply:\n\n\"You said 'save it for a wedding band'. This is a wedding band.\" \n\n\nShe just huffed and stopped bothering me about it.\n\n\nTl;dr mom made me take off my stainless steel ring and move it to the other hand, so I put my ace ring on the finger she just made me move my other ring off of and pointed out that it *was* a wedding band.",

        "text": "First time posting here, just need to rant and thank you for reading. \n\nAlso on mobile, so sorry for formatting. \n\nTo give some backstory, I‚Äôm a 19 year old in community college living in a small neighborhood in my parents old, small house. I mow my own lawn, which is reasonably small, because there is no HOA and I can‚Äôt hire anyone to do it for me. (Also the sun and exercise is great). Three of my neighbors are either elderly, don‚Äôt have the time, or don‚Äôt own mowers of their own, so I mow their reasonably small lawns for free at the same time I mow mine. I live in a very close neighborhood, so while I may do mowing, another neighbor may power wash driveways or some such.  Let‚Äôs just say I mow out of the goodness of my heart, and get compensated with a bottle of cold water afterward by two out of the three. The third, however, is where the malicious compliance begins. \n\nThe third neighbor is a very stubborn, forty-something year old lady who\n\n1.  Owns her own mower. \n2. Can afford to hire someone to do it for her. \n3. Is very specific about how and when her lawn gets done, even though it‚Äôs free. \n\nReason three pisses me off the most, honestly because she does not let me use my mower, or fix hers. Seriously, it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs punishing me for volunteering to help her. And this mower. Is. A. Piece. Of. Shit. The blades are dull, and she doesn‚Äôt let me sharpen them. It‚Äôs clogged full of old grass, she doesn‚Äôt let me clean it. And yet every time I ask if I can tidy it up, she snaps ‚ÄúQuit wasting time and just get the job done!‚Äù\nShe is mean, entitled, and doesn‚Äôt care that I do four lawns in one day. Even on days where I can‚Äôt mow the lawn because I‚Äôm feeling under the weather, or am just to busy with school, she threatens to call the ‚ÄúHOA‚Äù (again we don‚Äôt have one) and report me for running a business without a license, unless I get the lawn mowed. \nI‚Äôm pretty sure of three things, you don‚Äôt need a license to mow a lawn, it‚Äôs not a business since I don‚Äôt ask for money or compensation, and that she doesn‚Äôt have the number for the home owners association that doesn‚Äôt exist. \n\nI honestly should have stopped volunteering to mow her lawn a long time ago, but I just never had the heart. Except for last week. It‚Äôs July, rainy, and very hot, and on the morning I was ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù to mow, it poured like a sonofabitch. Now those of you who mow lawns know, you can‚Äôt, or rather, shouldn‚Äôt mow your lawn directly after it rains for various reasons, and my neighborhood is pretty shaded so it takes at least a day to dry up. \n\nSo around five o clock in the afternoon, I‚Äôm just relaxing and enjoying the free time, when out of nowhere there is a frantic smashing of a fist on my door (I would call it pounding, but it honestly wasn‚Äôt). Lo and behold, it‚Äôs SL (stubborn lady), looking annoyed as ever. As soon as I crack my door, the yelling starts, and I‚Äôm almost blasted back as she tries to push my door open. I couldn‚Äôt make out most of what she was saying, but I did hear the words ‚Äúlazy‚Äù, ‚Äúbrat‚Äù, and ‚Äúmillennial‚Äù thrown in there. I‚Äôm pretty laid back and used to dealing with angry adults, so this doesn‚Äôt irk me all that much, but when she pushed the door open, that started to piss me off. Then she started to talk in an understanding voice. \n\nSL: WHY ISN‚ÄôT MY LAWN MOWED?! I NEED IT MOWED RIGHT NOW!\n\nMe: Ma‚Äôam it rained pretty heavily today and I can‚Äôt m-\n\nSL: I DON‚ÄôT GIVE A RATS ASS WHAT THE WEATHER IS LIKE, YOU BETTER GET YOUR FUCKIN ASS OUT THERE, I HAVE COMPANY!\n\nMe: Ma‚Äôam, I‚Äôm not going to do your lawn, I didn‚Äôt even mow my own today. Please stop harassing me!\n\nSL: (with her teeth clenched and neck veins popping) if you don‚Äôt mow the lawn RIGHT GOD DAMN NOW I will report you like I should have done a long time ago  \n\nNow while I could have argued, which I don‚Äôt like to do, I had thought of a better plan. \n\nMe: *sigh* alright ma‚Äôam, may I at least use my mower? \n\nSL: no goddamn way you snot nosed kid, I want my lawn exactly the way I like it. \n\nMy plan was in action. So, grabbing her lawn mower, and seeing that her and her company‚Äôs freshly rained on ‚Äúfancy‚Äù cars were all right on the edge of the lawn, I started to mow. I only got about halfway through before the mower completely shut down due to clogging and the sheer dullness of the blade, but it all worked out. \n\nLater that day after a nice shower and meal, I heard the reaction to my compliance, which was, to my amusement, the insane screaming and ranting about why the lawn was only half done and every car was caked in mud and grass. I only got in trouble with her, as none of my neighbors liked her very much, and of course she threatened again to report me to the nonexistent HOA, to which I said go ahead, and then once and for all told her that I refuse to mow her lawn ever again. \n\nTL:DR- Was threatened by a lady to mow lawn for no pay on a rainy day, covered her fancy car with mud and grass clippings. \n\nUpdate: since I‚Äôm getting so many positive comments, I would just like to add that the other neighbors are going super out of their way and pitching me a few dollars to help me buy a brand new self propelled mower! Go neighborliness!!!\n\nEdit: added TLDR also thank you my first gold!!!",

        "text": "I work at a very popular restaurant that sells a lot in a single day. We have the same system where you get your schedule and usually thats it but sometimes people need shift changes. Before we where able to switch shifts as long as you found someone to switch with ir cover you as long as they didn‚Äôt hit overtime. \n\nUntil recently my boss decided that we could no longer switch shifts or get covers unless you where sick, which you also needed a doctors note. Of course this policy fell apart quickly and the boss had to start letting a few people switch. A week ago i covered for a coworker, a fellow cook, i don‚Äôt know the reason as i didn‚Äôt ask nor did i care, more money for me right? He gets permission from the boss and so i cover him no problems but this week i wanted to go to a party at night but the next morning i had to work early in the morning. This sucks. So i talk to the person who i covered and asked him if he would be ok switching, he didn‚Äôt mind since i covered for him, besides we worked the same day he just worked a couple hours later. There also wouldn‚Äôt be an overtime problem since the shifts where both the same time. When i ask my manager if its ok he tells me that it doesn‚Äôt matter to him if i want to go to a party, that if it was important to me i would have let him know so he could give me the day. I try to tell him that the person is ok with it and that either way he owed me the favor. He still said no even tho it was really not a big deal like at all, he just didn‚Äôt want to let me change.\n\nThis pissed me off a lot since i would always stay anywhere from 3-9 hours extra on my original shift on occasions where someone else either didn‚Äôt show up at all or had a last minute call in. I had done this several times and i knew this would be the way to get my petty revenge. Next time someone didn‚Äôt show up for the closing shift on a busy day, (a busy day for us is like 12k a day) he asked me if i could stay and close, i let him know that i can‚Äôt when he asked why i told him the same thing he told me. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt matter to me if someone didn‚Äôt show up.‚Äù He got mad and walked away. I promptly left at the time that it said in my schedule that i should leave. I heard from other coworkers that it was super busy and that the manager wasn‚Äôt able to cook fast enough to satisfy the demand. We had a lot of complaints (which go onto the managers record as well as the stores). ",

        "text": "LTL; FTP all that.\nSorry about formatting, I‚Äôm on mobile.\n\nDisclaimer: this story is a bit stupid, as it deals with a simple family disagreement, but I felt that it would fit in well here.\n\nSo a little bit of backstory:\n\nMy sister(who is three years older, we shall call her ‚ÄúS‚Äù) and I share a Jack and Jill bathroom between our bedrooms. When we were younger, like elementary and middle school age, this wasn‚Äôt really an issue. However once we were both teenagers and hygiene was more and more important, there became a somewhat regular battle over who got to shower and when. \n\nBeing high schoolers, we did stay up quite late doing homework, procrastinating and whatnot. Regardless, we both like to shower at night. It became a race for who could get in first. Admittedly this is a bit stupid because we easily could have showered an hour ago but after enough pissing off, the MC is well worth it. \n\nThe times S made it into the shower first, she didnt get out for at least another half hour, and by that time it was 10:30 or 11:00 PM, and not worth the rage of sleep deprived S in the morning.\n\nThe times I was able to get into the shower first, there would be a knock about 10 minutes in and a yell of ‚ÄúHURRY UP I NEED TO SHOWER TOO!‚Äù So being the nice little brother I am, I wrap it up and be out within another five minutes. \n\nOf course, S would wait about 30 minutes(yes, I timed it on multiple occasions) for ‚Äúthe hot water to come back‚Äù and then turn on the faucet and do her business. Now often times she‚Äôll accuse me of taking extremely long showers and wasting all of her time, but sometimes she‚Äôll have the water running for upwards of an hour. It astonishes me the hypocrisy. Eventually I confronted her and talked about a solution. The conversation went a little like this:\n\nMe: Hey S can we talk about the shower situation please?\n\nS: Oh my god fine.\n\nMe: Since you‚Äôve been calling me out for taking too long in the shower, and frequently knocking and telling me to hurry up, while taking twice as long as me, can we please just agree to just both shower earlier so it isn‚Äôt a problem?\n\nS: How about I shower at night and you shower in the morning?\n\nInstantly seeing the loophole here, and desperately wanting my revenge. I simply said ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù And walked away. \n\nI‚Äôm sure many of you can see where this is going. That night she took her normal 10:00 to 11:00 shower. And then, at 12:01 I started mine, and didn‚Äôt get out until I was sure she had woken up and realized her mistake. I slept amazing that night.\n\n\nTl;dr: Sister forces me to shower in the mornings because when we both shower at night because it ‚Äúkeeps her awake too long.‚Äù I proceed to shower at 12:01.\n\n\nEdit: Grammar",

The ladies there all know me fairly well and are all great people.\n\nOne day I was standing in the returning customer's line due to issues with their number calling system and got to listen to a very long and involved conversation between a customer and the DMV clerk.\n\nCUST: Yeah, this truck was just a great deal at only $4000. I want to register it, and it says right here on your website that all I need to do is bring in my paperwork and you can register it for me.\n\nCLERK: I'm sorry sir but I cannot register this truck to you when it involves a non-reg situation as this one does.\n\nThe conversation continued for 10-15 minutes, back and forth. The customer got on the phone with the DMV hotline and eventually spoke to a specialist. He pulled up the DMV website on his phone and showed the clerk the relavent information proving that he could indeed register his vehicle by coming to the DMV. Meanwhile, the clerk had pulled up her own instructional booklet and was reading to him and eventually the specialist on the phone that she was forbidden from issuing registration or title and this was very clearly spelled on page XX.X in her manual. The entire time, the DMV clerk is trying to tell the customer that this just isn't possible and she cannot help him and to take the truck and sell it if he can.\n\n\nThe customer left while speaking to the specialist and came back while my paperwork was being processed. The specialist was going to have DMV corporate call this clerk and give her special instructions on how to process this customer's paperwork; the specialist was very helpful, and the customer promised to come back the following day all while thanking the clerk profusely. \n\n\nHappy ending, right? No so much.\n\n\nNon-Reg means that this particular customer was on a list that prevented him from registering a vehicle. Multiple DUIs or other suspended license issues. And yet here he was trying to process his vehicle through; the DMV website was purposefully vague on the details and clearly states that some partial work can be completed when visiting a local branch.\n\nMeanwhile, when cases like this come up at the DMV, the clerks are to accept the paperwork and run it through in an offline mode which doesn't actually send the documents through, print off confirmation for the customer, and then notify law enforcement after the customer left. Which is exactly what the clerk ended up doing the following day.\n\nThe miserable cherry on top of this pathos sundae is that the customer turned to me before leaving and said \"Sorry, these things just keep happening to me.\"\n\n\nTL:DR Customer was on a list that prevented him from buying cheese. The Government set up a slick little moustrap and walked him through the process of setting up and baiting it with his own cheese before letting him have it.",

I got above minimum wage and worked in an environment with a more relaxed working pace. We had more time than your average hotel to clean rooms and it showed in customer satisfaction. We had stellar reviews with customers raving about how there wasn't a speck of dust anywhere, how everything from the lamp shades to the bathroom drain was always scrubbed squeaky clean.\n\nI loved my job and took pride in it, and when we had extra time, (which happened from time to time,) we would do some deeper cleaning like scrubbing all the walls inch by inch, disinfecting the whole bathroom, cleaning the blinds etc. Even though we all had some extra time, we used it to make sure the rooms were always up to a very high standard.\n\nAs a result of this, we got a reputation of being an affordable but very clean hotel, so our popularity spiked. Even before we got so popular (in our prime we were booked full about 90&amp;#37; of the days) our boss made a pretty nice amount of money. We don't have a reception, we're self-service (you just get a passcode for your room via text message) so he saved money with that. He drives an expensive car and seems very well off. We were never struggling financially.\n\nThen things started changing. We're a very close-knitted team of cleaners who have been in the house for years. A couple of us left at the end of last year (one moved to another state, another became a housewife after having a kid), and we started expecting newcomers to our team. They never came. Our boss claimed that it's hard to find workers for this kind of job. We never had anyone interviewed and I never saw ads anywhere that we're hiring, so I'm not sure he was even planning on replacing them. So our work pace got tighter. We managed somehow but there was no longer time for thorough cleaning.\n\nThen, the boss opened a restaurant so that the guests could have breakfast. Cleaning it daily got added to our workload (and that place is massive, it takes at least 1¬Ω hours to clean daily). At the same time, he also opened a separate airbnb-style apartment (three bedrooms, kitchen, living room and bathroom) for larger groups who wanted to reside together. Cleaning that fell on us as well.\n\nSo suddenly, we were down two people (there were seven of us initially) and shoved two massive new responsibilities. We asked our boss again to hire more people, but he said no and that \"we've been having it too easy\" beforehand. He also refused to add another hour or two to our daily working hours (currently 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.). We have six hours and everything needs to be done at 3 p.m. sharp because that's when the new passcodes start working.\n\nUnderstandably, we were stressed out. There was suddenly far too much to do and our boss also simultaneously expected that we would keep up our usual cleaning standard. But when our time per room plummets from 45 min to 25 min tops (usually closer to 15), obviously we're not able to clean everything the way we did before. We would get yelled at when we got bad feedback because there wasn't enough time to clean thoroughly enough, customers who came in after our clean rooms were disappointed and took their business elsewhere. Also, my coworkers started calling in sick because they were burnt out. It was a mess, but our boss maintained the outlook that if he just pushed a massive amount of work on us, we'd somehow magically find an extra pair of hands and get everything done 100&amp;#37;.\n\nLast week, we had a meeting with my coworkers. We discussed the current situation and to my surprise, everyone was considering quitting. Out of loyalty to our long-time employer, the five of us agreed to have a meeting with our boss and try to persuade him to hire more staff to bring the hotel back to its earlier standard. A couple of days later, we had the said meeting. Our boss was still in denial and said that we just need to up our pace and do things faster. He cited that most hotels give housekeepers about 20 minutes to do everything. We pointed out that it's true, but in that case he can't expect us to clean better than those hotels. He scoffed and told us \"If you don't like working here, then leave.\"\n\nThat was all we needed to hear. That night we had another meeting amongst us cleaners. We checked our contracts and realized there was no agreed on notice for resignation as we're at-will. So, we were all going to take his advice.\n\nThis morning, at 9 a.m. sharp, the five of us paid our boss a visit. The look on his face when we simultaneously slammed down our resignation letters and marched out, leaving no one to clean the whole hotel today, will warm my heart for the rest of my days. He was absolutely stunned.\n\nHe tried to call us to talk things over. Nuh uh, we just did what you told us to. Have fun replacing what was a motivated, loyal and dedicated team of cleaners who made your business bloom.\n\nTL;DR Boss refuses to replace employees who left and simultaneously adds a fuckton of work to us employees who are already struggling and burnt out. When we try to tell him that we can't take it anymore, he tells us that \"if we don't like it, then leave\". We take his advice and all resign simultaneously without prior notice, leaving him in deep shit. Feels good man.",

        "text": "The big industrial and infrastructure jobs are always an exercise in logistics at a concrete plant.  It takes about 40,000 pounds of concrete to fill a standard 10 cubic yard (about 2,020 gallons) drum.  All that material has to be brought in by semi.  To ship 100 yards (10 mixers), it is going to take about three [trucks](http://assets.graniterockcdn.com/production/39c2ec39-b316-4112-b08c-df2fafaaca17.png) of rock, four of sand and one [powder train](http://truck-photos.net.s3.amazonaws.com/15533.jpg).  A single job can easily be over 1,000 yards; the biggest I have personally seen was over 5,000 (and as much of a nightmare as it sounds).  \n  \nSo, this night we are running about 2,000 yards, on two boom pumps.  The loads are basically going out back-to back, as fast as Bob (the plant manager) can load them.  I am not in my truck.  I am down in the yard directing traffic.  The anthropomorphic personification of Putt's Law, commonly known as Chad, had decided that this job is too big to let Bob handle things (Bob has only been with the company for 20 years).  He is concerned that the drivers will get confused driving the 100 meters across the yard, so I am out there making sure the material trucks go to the material lane (a large grate in the ground where they can dump rock and sand down onto a conveyor belt), the powder trains go to the powder lane (on the opposite side of the plant, where the hoses to pump the cement are), and the mixer drivers go to one of the batch lanes (directly under the big, whomping batch plant that they work at every day).\n  \nThings are fine for the first few hundred yards, but Bob is spending powder faster than the powder trains can unload it.  Eventually, the silos run dry, and things slow down to the match the unloading rate.  This upsets Chad.  There are trucks stacked up at the job site, but they are starting to dwindle, while the line of empty trucks at the plant starts to extend out into the street.  There is risk of a gap in service.  Then we get a reprieve; one of the pumps breaks down, and the rate of work on the job site is cut in half.  Bob can slow down enough that the powder trains refill the silos; we even get a couple stacked up and waiting to unload.  When we get the word that the second pump is back in action, Bob goes over to the powder lane to tell the drivers that they can start unloading like normal as soon as he finishes loading the next truck.  \n  \nIt is at this point that Chad oozes his way over, with all the charm and benign purpose of Sarah Lewis' cesspit.  He doesn't want to risk a service gap.  He wants the powder trains to start unloading faster, fast enough to match what Bob is sending out.  The powder train drivers say they are already unloading as fast as they can.  Chad doesn't believe this; he knows the transfer system operates on variable pressure, and the drivers do not operate at the compressor's limit.\n  \nCement powder is very fine, and it carries on the air very easily.  When delivering cement, air is blasted into the trailer, creating a thick, misanthropic cloud of lung damage and chemical burns.  Fortunately, this cloud is trapped inside the trailer, and the only escape is through a hose, and up into the [silo](http://www.cement101.com/images-site/terminal-120-ton-silo.jpg).  The pumping speed by is dependent on the pressure inside the trailer, so what Chad wants them to do is up the pressure to the point where they are putting in powder at the same speed Bob is pulling it out.  The drivers refuse to do it; company policy limits the maximum pressure they can run at.  Chad doesn't care.  Those limits are there to keep the silo from getting overfilled.  With Bob pulling out powder as fast as he is, there should be enough time to shut down if the inventory alarm goes off.  The drivers still refuse.  Then Chad threatens to fire them for delaying such an important job.  Bob and the drivers look at each other, then Bob unlocks the adjacent storeroom and walks away, while the drivers crank up the pressure.  \n\nWhen he gets back to the office, Bob tosses me his keys and asks me to move his car over next to mine.  Bob normally parks right next to to the office, on what is usually the leeward side of the building.  I normally park on the east end of the yard.  I like it better than the street, but it means my car catches a lot of dust off the plant.  So I move Bob's car and start walking back.  By this time, Chad has moved up onto the catwalk above the loading lanes, where he can gaze over his efficient little kingdom like Yertle the Turtle.  \n  \nThen one of the bag houses burps.  \n  \nIf you look at that picture of the powder silos, you might notice what look like miniature silos on top of them.  Those are the bag houses.  Inside each of them are several dozen felt bags, like four-foot long windsocks with one end sewn shut.  That end is hung from the roof, while the open end is clamped to holes in the floor (the roof of the main silo).  As the air and cement powder is blasted into the silo, those bags act as filters, allowing the air to escape, while keeping the cement inside.  As best as we can figure, what happened was that the air was being blown in at a high enough pressure that it was packing those bags full of powder, and restricting the airflow out.  There was no alarm because the powder level was still below the sensor, but the pressure was building up inside.  When the pressure finally grew too great, it tore three bags, blew open the bag house door (ripping the lock off in the process), and spewed a mushroom cloud of powder into the air.  \n  \nI am about halfway back across the yard when I see the powder drivers slap their dump valves and dive into the storeroom.  A couple seconds later, somebody turns off the moon.  A couple seconds after that, the penny drops and I race for the office at a dead sprint.  Chad is still up on the catwalk.  Chad does not realize what has just happened.  Thanks to the massive halogen lamps mounted all over the plant, he does not notice lack of moonlight.  He has no clue that directly above him, one of the bag houses is vomiting out darkness like an angry, bilious volcano god.  All chad can see is me running into the office and pulling the doorstop, and the drivers all across the yard in front of him frantically rolling up their windows.  And then it hit him.  \n  \nOur plant is on the west side of the yard.  This is pretty normal in Southern California, because the prevailing winds blow in off the ocean.  That means that any dust or powder that escapes the plant blows across our yard and has a chance to settle there before crossing into the neighboring properties (for similar reasons, the bag house doors open towards the yard).  In addition, that means Chad is standing on the east catwalk, so he can look across the bulk of the yard.  Finally, that means that when falling powder was caught by the Santa Ana winds that had been blowing on and off all night, it got pushed straight back into Chad's face.  The stuff came boiling down across the catwalk, hit the ground and flooded out both sides of the loading lane.  It was the kind of thing you expect to see Dwayne Johnson running away from, a semi-dysfunctional sibling unit in tow (about to learn a valuable lesson about life, love, and/or family), while *O Fortuna* blares over the house speakers.  The mess it made was glorious (especially in the break room, which had an open door facing the loading lane...the people inside were pissed).  \n  \nThings could have been much worse.  Fortunately, since the powder drivers were expecting it, usually the immediate response to a bag house failure is for the driver to stand there dumbfounded for a couple seconds, then shut everything down.  These guys killed the system in both silos immediately.  Still, there was a lot of pressure in the silo, and it doesn't take a lot of powder to make a huge cloud.  We also had to run for the rest of the night with the torn bags (I did re-bolt the door closed).  After the shift ended, I took a little drive downwind of the plant.  There was cement powder in parking lots a half-mile away.  \n  \nNow, in normal circumstances a blown bag house is going to cause an investigation, and someone is probably going to be suspended or fired.  These were not normal circumstances; AQMD got wind of what happened.  The Air Quality Management Districts are the boogeymen of the construction industry.  If you've ever driven past a construction site, you have probably seen [the big signs](https://contribly-public.s3.amazonaws.com/media/0b00d025-14f1-4d1b-9068-f6d30edfed3a-mediumoriginalaspectdouble.jpg) that say, \"If you see dust coming from this project, call:\" and several phone numbers.  One of those numbers is always for AQMD (usually the last one, because the contractor is hoping for a chance to fix things before AQMD shows up.  Just arriving on site is enough to completely shut down operations, while a bunch of 300-pound truckers and construction workers peer fearfully through the blinds at a little, white pickup and it's 110-pound occupant.  The reason for this bowel voiding fear is that AQMD can levy absolutely stupid-high fines; in California, the cap is $1,000,000 per day per violation (though you would basically have to be a *Captain Planet* villain to actually get a fine that high).  Now AQMD can't prove it was us (technically, another plant could have blown a bag house during an overnight delivery), but we were the only plant running a large night job in the area.  They know it's us, and that is putting us under greater scrutiny.  Corporate doesn't particularly like that, so the investigation gets kicked up a notch.  \n  \nBlame is immediately leveled at the driver whose silo blew.  Between him, the other driver and Bob, however, it soon becomes apparent that he had been forced to violate policy by Chad.  More than that, Chad was in charge of the ready mix division, but the powder drivers fell under the authority of the materials division.  He had been threatening an employee he had no authority over (technically the materials division is a separate company from ready mix).  Corporate wasn't about to just fire one of their highest ranking executives, since that would look bad.  Instead, Chad was promoted and given a larger office, with a spectacular view of the San Bernardino Mountains.  \n  \nIn addition to his duties with the ready mix division, Chad was put in charge of the construction of new facilities.  Of course, at that time, the only facility under construction was the new quarry.  Unfortunately, the quarry was nowhere near the corporate office (or Chad's house), so his desk was relocated on-site.  There wasn't anything permanent up at the quarry yet, so Chad's new office was converted from a steel container.  It had a corrugated metal awning to keep direct sunlight off the roof, a couple windows cut in the sides, spray-on insulation all over the inside, and a wall-mounted AC unit.  It also had a portable toilet planted next to it, because there was no plumbing or on-site water yet.  It did, as stated, have an absolutely spectacular view of the mountains (though that would probably have been more enjoyable without all the noise and dust from the construction).  To his credit, he lasted three whole weeks before deciding it was time to retire.  \n  \nTL/DR:  An upper manager threatened the job of two drivers unless they violated safety limits on their equipment.  It ended up causing a minor disaster, from which almost everyone but said manager found shelter.  He was transferred to a site with minimal facilities in the middle of nowhere and quit shortly thereafter.",

        "text": "I was at the doctors office today and had to bring my 15 month old twins with me. These kiddos do not enjoy being cooped up in a stroller but letting them wander around isn't an option since they both will immediately bolt in opposite directions. They have clean nappies, they've been fed and hydrated, so at this point any fussing is just stroller related crankiness. In preparation for having to wait a while and wanting to be considerate of the others who were in waiting room purgatory with me I packed the diaperbag full of endless snacks and sippy cups. Sure enough 5 minutes in they lose their mind so I instantly start giving them snacks and also walking back and forth in the very very large waiting room. I am at the back area and not even close to being in anyones way and as long as I am pacing the beasties will quietly munch away on their cheerios.\n\nAt one point I stop pacing to hear the doctor mumble the next patients name in another barely audible whisper and this is where cranky old lady decides to weigh in on my parenting. I hear a huffing noise and look over at her and the second we make eye contact she says \"Oh my gawd you have got to stop walking up and down that back area. You're making me dizzy. Also you really shouldn't be feeding them that much, just SIT DOWN and they will relax too. Watching toddlers really shouldn't be that hard hun.\" Thanks. Firstly, while my girls are very healthy, they were preemies born at 3lb/1.5kg and are still very tiny so I will feed them all the damn cheerios I want. Secondly I am doing all this not for myself or the twins but for the benefit of all those around us. Finally I was waiting to find out if my scans showed cancer or not (hurray scans were clean) so I was all out of fucks to give at the moment.\n\nNow for the malicious compliance. I take her advice and sit down. Right next to her.¬†Tons of empty seats everywhere by the way. Instantly they start screaming their heads off and what do I do? I pull out my book and start reading. Anyone who has ever been seated next to a strangers baby having a meltdown, close your eyes, imagine that shitty moment and now double it to account for twins. Within 5 minutes she is looking like she is about to snap and suggests they might want a snack. To which I calmy respond \"Nah, I really shouldn't be feeding them that much\" and calmly turn the page of my book. Ten minutes later my name is finally called and this lady looks like she is ready to give up on life. I however have read my first chapter in ages. I guess watching toddlers really isnt that hard after all.",

As a result, we have accumulated so much junk in our garage that it went from three to two to none, and back to one because I got annoyed. We \"installed\" cabinets, ie recycled them from our house reno, they barely work, are old, and really out of place. They also make it impossible to park. Our house is still unfinished, after 3 or 4 years here. It still needs work in places my dad said he would do. Which I think is never. We only got furniture for one of the rooms a year ago. After 2-3 years here. On top of that my dad decides, what better to do than buy another house? So we have that junk now, because apparently \"Mexican workers cannot be trusted.\" Unfortunately, my mom also passed away a couple of months ago. I'm mostly over it, as sad as that sounds. The thing is, we had boxes upon boxes of medical supplies too. My dad, instead of donating them or asking for them to get picked up, is holding onto them until our insurance \"sends him a check for them\" which is really stupid. We are by no means poor, and we don't need to resort to that kind of stuff. I'd understand if we were broke, but we're not. We have so much junk it has become difficult to walk around the garage. If you need something, you have to move ten other things to get to it. I tried time and time again to clean it all up. I've had the garage clean to the point where you can park three cars in it easy. No longer. I've been told that I can't get rid of anything or throw it out. My family says to wait a day so they can help me clean it up, but then they never do. \n\nYesterday, I was super pissed, walking through the garage, and I had an epiphany... I don't have to throw anything out. So, I started cleaning, and I ended up finding some cool stuff. At the end of about two hours of work, we had a two car garage. I didn't say three, because what I ended up doing was storing everything I couldn't throw out on the side where my dad gets his tools and other things. Walking there is a a nightmare, and you can't even hope to get anything without avalanching yourself in junk. Hopefully he cares enough now to start throwing stuff out. Knowing him, probably not. \n\nTLDR: Edit Someone gave me this tldr-\nDad stored enough junk to fill a three-car garage and wouldn't let me throw out *anything*.  Instead I \"organized\" it so it could still be a two-car garage and he can't reach his tools. \n\nPS: I should also add I'm not racist and my father said that. He's been acting like this for years for those who say he's depressed. I've tried time and time again to talk to him about it. He doesn't want to listen at all. It",

        "text": "This is gonna be long but who gives a shit.\n\nInitialisms:  CC=courtesy clerk, PIC=person in charge.\n\nBackstory/setup: Before I switched to working in the bakery I was a CC at **Grocery Store** (not gonna say what it is just say it got merged with another grocery store, partially sold off and then repurchased by the merged stores). As I was one of the older ones I usually ended up working the closing shift (3:30-12)since I didn't have to worry about any sort of curfew. As the closing CC my main list of things that had to be done was clear the bottle return are, empty the trashes, make sure the bathrooms were clean and make sure all grocery carts were brought in before I left. The last was fairly important because we would have secret shoppers come in and rate us and one of the categories was number of loose carts in the parking lot.\n\nThe story: As things seem to always go when I started there was always a second clerk there until 10 to maintain the bottle area, deal with customers and bring in the carts, but by the time of this incident they would only be there 'til 8 if there was anyone scheduled at all. So since I'm not always the most motivated worker I would occasionally take the shortcut of only bringing in the loose carts and leaving the one that were in the designated corrals outside, that way I could honestly say I brought in the carts and go home. I didn't and still don't see it as a big problem usually because the ones in the corrals never counted against the secret shop score and the morning CC would bring them in before the secret shoppers ever showed up. So on this particular night the other CC had gone home by 6 or 7 and it was ridiculously busy, so when it came time for me to do my closing tasks I was way behind. Since I had gotten in trouble previously for getting overtime I decided it was gonna be a loose cart only night. \n\nAfter bringing in the loose carts I told the PIC I brought in the carts and was gonna go home, however since she knew how busy it had been she also knew I hadn't spent enough time to bring in all the carts from outside. So she told me I couldn't leave until they were brought in so I brought them in. This time however I followed policy to the letter. When I first was hired the policy was you could only bring in 6 carts at a time, but when you were closing the PICs turned a blind eye to bringing in more than that as long as you didn't hurt yourself. So would regularly push in 10 to 15 at a time. So she was expecting it to take 5 maybe 10 minutes at most for me to get all the corralled carts, not this night nope I only brought in as many as policy would allow, which had been lowered to 4 at a time since a new hire had managed to bust her lip open bringing in carts a few months prior. I ended up with about 45 minutes of overtime and she couldn't say anything. \n\nI actually was and still am friends with her and we were talking about it one time and she told me it was one of two times she got seriously mad at me but that time couldn't say anything 'cause it was policy and she had technically approved the overtime.\n\n**TL:DR:** Manager told me to bring in carts so I did.",

I say at large because a majority of my work was on the plant floor, with my office only being used for paperwork and the occasional precision inspection.

Nine if you count the two guys that were in charge of my work twice.\n\nZapa (I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a real name, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt this guy‚Äôs real name) was an engineer from overseas, and his culture tends to produce arrogance in people that gain positions of authority. I don‚Äôt have a problem with people from that country, but both Zapa and his boss are some of the most arrogant men I have ever met (topping that list is a professor from the same country).\n\nAll of the supervisors and quality staff are required to have a radio. Our radios had several channels, and the QA team had their own. This would seem to make any conversation private, but the line inspectors all wore radios so a lot of the plant could hear them.\n\nThis particular bit of MC starts with a biological break. I am almost finished doing my business when I get called over the radio.\n\n‚Äú*tales*, this is Zapa.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGo for *tales*.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhere are you right now?‚Äù\n\nNot wanting to give the whole plant a mental picture they can‚Äôt unsee, I reply with ‚ÄúIndisposed.

        "text": "Picture Jack.  Jack wasn't just your average dispatcher.  All dispatchers are the natural enemies of drivers, but Jack was something special.  He was a wretched, little homunculus who fed on human misery and frustration, and couldn't find his own ass with both hands and a map.  When shuffling trucks to help cover plants that were short, he delighted in sending drivers that worked four or five plants distant, and tacking an extra 90 minutes of driving onto the end of their day (turning a 10-12 hour day into 12-14).  Sometimes it was even worse.  I work in the Coachella Valley in California, and on occasion we would see our drivers shipped all the way to the coast.  I was something of a special irritant to Jack; about the only person who can override a dispatcher is the local plant manager, and my manger, Bob, would always try to keep me local so I was available to help close.  \n  \nJack knew why it would happen, but being overridden pissed him off.  Every time it happened, he would complain about it to Dan, the regional manager.  Of course, Dan was a former plant manager, and he knew exactly what kind of games the dispatchers played with the drivers, so the he told Bob that we were in the clear.  Increasingly frustrated, Jack began regularly trying to ship me west any time a truck was needed out there, regardless of where I was or how long it would take me to get out there (I was usually over 50 miles away from where he was trying to send me).  And every time he did that, Bob would just tell me to come back to the home plant.  It soon became apparent that Jack wasn't even checking where I was or if there were trucks available at closer plants, and Bob gave me a standing order to ignore dispatch.  \n  \nNow enter Chad.  Chad was a petty bureaucrat in every sense of the words.  He was also the taint manager at our company, nestled squarely between the regional managers and the operations manager.  In theory he was in charge of the mixer division, but he didn't know or care much about mixers.  What Chad cared about was efficiency, and at the time he thought the best show of efficiency would be to start shutting down some of the smaller plants.  We didn't get shut down, but several plants east of us did.  Their drivers were transferred to the larger neighboring plants, and those plants were expected to extend their coverage area.  Bob hates Chad.  \n  \nChad's closure of our Imperial Valley plant was how I wound up volunteering to haul a load of Slurry (a mixture of sand, water and just enough cement to make it harden into sandstone; it's used to fill trenches and holes) down to Calexico on a Saturday morning.  It was over 100 miles to get there, but there was no longer anywhere closer to ship from.  Four of us loaded up early in the morning and made the two and a half hour drive down to the border.  I was about ten miles from the job site when my computer flashed a message from dispatch: \"Into San Bernardino off the job.\"  \n  \nWe pour out the slurry and head to the local plant to refuel; it had been mothballed, but the fuel pump still works.  While I am waiting for my turn to fuel up, I call Bob to tell him that Jack is trying to send me from Calexico to San Bernardino (about 175 miles).  We have a brief chuckle, then Bob goes quiet for a second.  He says, \"You know, you should do it.  Don't even stop here, just go straight out.  By the time you get there, they should be just about done anyway.\"  The unspoken message was clear.  It was Saturday, my entire day was already on time-and-a-half, and the job I was on had been an absolute milk run.  I could bag a few more hours of stress-free overtime by driving out to San Bernardino and immediately getting shipped back home.  So I refuel, grab something to eat and settle in for a four-hour drive.  \n  \nAs I exit the freeway in San Bernardino, my radio buzzes.  It turns out Bob's been periodically checking the tracking map to see where I was.  He says, \"Hey, give Ronnie a call before you pull in.\"  It reflects poorly on a plant when they ship out empty trucks (another of Chad's efficiency drives), so if I'm not going to get loaded, the San Bernardino manager isn't going to want me showing up in his yard.  I call Ronnie, and, sure enough, he's not going to have a load for me; he's already washing out his own trucks.  So I turn around and head back to Coachella.  All told, I ended up with over 10 hours of overtime for delivering a single load of slurry (and since it was just slurry, my drum wasn't even messed up).  \n  \nTurns out the story wasn't quite over.  I came in the following Monday, and Bob is sitting in the office with the most insincerely innocent grin I have ever seen.  He looks at me and says, \"So, that job you took on Saturday?  It was PW.\" and starts laughing his ass off.  When we get sent out on a prevailing wage job, our time is counted from the moment we batch until the moment we return to a batch plant.  Thanks to Chad's shenanigans, the Imperial Valley plant was no longer considered an active plant, so all four drivers on that job wound up getting paid prevailing wage at time and a half for the entire drive to and from Calexico.  In addition, because Bob had me bypass the home plant, and Ronnie turned me around before I hit his yard, I got PW for the drive to San Bernardino and back as well.  My time card landed in payroll like a squirrel in a kennel.  Shit was lost.  Shit hit the fan.  Shit rolled downhill, right out of the Operations Manager's office and straight over Chad and Jack.  A few weeks later, Jack was transferred to scheduling, where it was hoped he would do less damage.  Chad kept his job, but the Operations Manager made him reopen several of the closed plants (Chad would fall to Malicious Compliance, but that is another story).  \n  \nTL/DR:  Dispatcher decided to send me to a plant 175 mile from the job site, and I went.  Ended up with bucketloads of prevailing wage overtime, got the dispatcher transferred, and caught an obnoxious manager in the fallout.",

        "text": "Happened last month.  I had ordered a laptop online to pick up at one of the store's retail locations a couple of days later.  When I got there, I perused the laptops section before going to the online order pickup line.  And I happened to find another laptop I thought the wife would like.  So I went to the online pickup line to buy the one I had ordered online, along with the one I found for my  wife.  When I got there, they stated they didn't have the one I ordered online.  No problem, I said - I saw a bunch of them (25+) of the exact same model stacked in the laptop section.   Sales clerk has a runner go back there and grab it it for me (it was really slow, so thankfully, didn't hold anyone up).  They ring up both laptops, but the one I ordered online rung up for $70 more than was listed online when I ordered it.  They had a \"manager\" look at the issue and he stated that there was a sale when I had ordered the laptop online, but the sale was over.  I explained I was still within the 3-day window of picking up the laptop at the price I had ordered it at (even showed him my online order confirmation), but the guy would not budge.  So here I was with over $500 of inventory I wanted to take off his hands on an obviously slow day, but he said he could not sell me them at the price that I believe I owed them.  I asked him one last time if he could not sell me these 2 laptops at the agreed-upon price.  He said I could either buy the laptop at the $70 higher price or I could not buy it at all.  So I maliciously complied and did not buy that laptop.  I then left the store with no laptops (not even the one I had thought about buying for my wife).\n\nNow you may or may not believe this next part, but this actually happened, and I was surprised myself that it did.\n\nAfter a couple of days, I received an automated e-mail asking how I enjoyed my online shopping experience.  Well, you could very well imagine what I did.  I lit into them.  \"You had put that model laptop on sale because it was not selling well.  It sold so poorly that even after the sale was over, you *still* had a stack of over 25 of them sitting on the sales floor (and who knows how many in the back).  Because the manager did not understand how the online ordering system worked, he lost not one, but two decent-sized sales on an obviously slow sales day.\"\n\nEpilogue:  The next week, I receive my weekly e-mail from that exact same store chain.  Lo and behold, the exact same model laptop is on sale again at the price that it had been when I had ordered it online.  I couldn't help myself.  I ordered it again, and went to the store again to pick it up.  I know, I'm a glutton for punishment.  To my surprise, they did have the laptop ready for me at the price I had ordered it at this time.  But then something odd happened.  The sales clerk (not the same one from the other week), asked me to follow her, and she introduced me to the General Manager of the store.  The GM asked if I had found what I wanted and if I was satisfied with the purchase.  I said I was satisfied and thanked him for asking.  Then, I went to the cashier, paid my money, and left with the laptop.  So I don't know if my one little response made the slow-moving laptop go on sale again and/or the store policy got changed or they flagged me as a customer to placate, but it was almost a satisfying conclusion to my malicious compliance.  Oh, and I didn't buy that second laptop this time around, so they still actually lost one sale.",

Looking behind the counter it's obvious that they're understaffed for some reason and running around as fast as they can cooking and taking orders. \n\nThis costco has a row of registers with OPEN/CLOSED signs above them that are all fed by one zig-zagging line of people like [this](https://imgur.com/a/aEZxyQM) so you wait to be called forward by the next available employee.\n\nThis guy in the back of the line starts getting more and more pissed at how slow its moving. Exclaiming loudly, \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\", \"SERIOUSLY?\". Finally he has had enough and stomps up to the windows. He starts yelling \"OPEN UP ANOTHER REGISTER IDIOTS. WE'RE STARVING. THIS IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL\".  A guy behind the counter apologizes and turns another register from \"CLOSED\" to \"OPEN\".  This quiets him down and he stomps back to the line yelling \"SEE THEY JUST NEED TO BE YELLED AT TO DO THEIR JOBS. LAZY IDIOTS\".\n\n\nHere's the thing. There weren't enough employees back there to work another register. So they didn't. That register that was marked \"OPEN\" never had any employee behind it and never serviced any customers. It was just sitting there empty with the \"OPEN\" sign doing nothing. But at least it shut the guy up.",

        "text": "Hey, all! First post on this sub, though it's from a throwaway account because I don't want to risk the few Redditors at work IDing my account from this story. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo, I work at a jail as an officer in a direct supervision jail. Basically, I'm in the pod with them when they exit their cells. Where I am, an officer typically supervises between 30 to 80 inmates on a given day. Now, as anyone in corrections can tell you, certain inmates like to talk shit. Some of them talk straight diarrhea out of their mouth. This is usually amplified during lockdown periods when an officer who isn't assigned to their pod is doing rounds. Personally, I get a lot of this, as I work the swing shift, and I basically fill in wherever an officer is needed that day. After over a year of working at this job, I'd developed a pretty thick skin to pretty much anything you could think to call me.\n\n\nNow, the biggest way to deal with inmates who don't listen is to write an institutional charge, which is basically just a written document saying \"This guy broke the rules.\" There is a charge for harassing staff, which is mostly used to slap wrists when someone won't stop talking shit when they should.\n\n\nOn this particular day, I was coming through a pod I had been in a few days ago to do count (count up everyone in a pod to make sure everyone is accounted for.) An inmate who I had written up then saw me and started tossing insults my way over what he thought was just me trying to get him personally in trouble. (Truth be told I was happy to write him up because he was generally annoying, but I didn't single him out.) Most of what he says is the most generic insulting stuff you end up hearing (mostly a lot of \"bitch\" and \"pussy\"), which I largely ignored because I'd heard it all before.\n\nBefore leaving the pod, though, I hear him call out \"You know what? I dare you to write me up again!\" As an officer, that particular statement is a bigger statement than a normal dare. It essentially means \"I don't care about your authority, so I want you to write me up, because I'll get away with it!\" So, I just said OK, and I very visibly wrote down everything I had actually heard him say before leaving, all the while him still yelling at me.\n So, at the end of my shift I wrote the report and left.\n\n\nFast forward to today, when his hearing came up. I wasn't personally there, but I did receive an e-mail as a typical follow up. The hearing officer had decided he needed to have some actual punishment, and actually increased what I had recommended from one week of losing his phone privileges (basically a non-punishment) to three weeks of losing everything: No phone, no ordering food, not visitation. He must have really pissed that hearing officer off, but, hey, them's the breaks.\n\nTL;DR: An inmate dares me to write them up for cursing me out. I do, and he gets a higher punishment than I recommended.",

The work is gruelling and dangerous, the pay is intentionally abysmal, the job is entirely beneath my degree, and the only thing I've ever gotten for working hard is more and harder work.\n\nA few weeks ago I was offered a promotion. My manager sold it to me as less work, but done with higher quality expectations and a couple dollars per hour raise. I was intending to leave soon anyway, but I accepted for now. That was three weeks ago. Since then the head of the laboratory has gotten involved and my workload has doubled instead of decreasing. The expected raise also dropped, first to a dollar, then 75 cents, then 50 cents now and possibly another 50 cents in a year or so. Today I got word it's been finalized as about 40 cents per hour...\n\nA few weeks ago my manager mentioned that every time we put on our full protective gear it costs about $10 in supplies. Well, they did tell me they had higher expectations for the quality of my work...\n\nToday at work I figured I'd better start changing gear every time I enter a new room. I mean sure, the work isn't the sort where that would matter, but its better to be safe than sorry. And I HAD to check all of my rooms at least once an hour, so with four rooms, well... It's sure good they saved so much money on my raise, I don't know how they could afford this level of care and attention otherwise.",

        "text": "Howdy folks! First time posting, glad to be here. Let's get to it.\n\nThis happened to me in about 2006, so I was 12 years younger and we'll leave it at that. It was a Sunday evening and I had been out clubbing the night before and lost my jacket. It had my only asthma inhaler in the pocket and I wasn't able to get a replacement until the next day when I could go to the pharmacy and get a repeat. For those who are not familiar with the system, normally you would go to a pharmacy and pay for your meds and then be allowed to get the same meds  the next month and one more month after before needing to see the doctor who would then prescribe either the same dosage or different depending on how it has been working for you. Either way, I only needed to wait for one day but I was starting to feel very short of breath.\n\nI decided that it would be best to bite the bullet and drive to the after-hours clinic that had a pharmacy open until late. (Turns out that was 10pm, but I didn't know this at the time and it was before I had a smart phone). I arrived at the pharmacy and asked if I could transfer a repeat from one pharmacy to another and, apparently, that's a no go. Sort of like getting a warranty replacement from a different store you purchased goods from. Anyway, I was at the after-hours clinic and would need to see a Dr but the after-hours is notorious for high prices, at least twice what you would pay at a regular clinic.\n\nI went to the reception desk and told them the story. I said that all I needed was the inhaler, I could get one tomorrow (literally 11 hours away until the other pharmacy opened) and that I was short on breath (and unbeknownst to me, short on time.)\n\nWell, they kept me waiting for an hour. Normally, I would be fine with that because I understand that some people have emergency needs, but it seemed like a slow night. Still. I'm not a Dr and I don't know what they were doing. But normally a person with breathing troubles is seen right away.\n\nAnyway, I see the Dr who does some pretty normal stuff and asks regular questions and then writes up a prescription. I'm fine with that, head to the pharmacy and find that it's shut. What a let down. I head to reception and update them on the scenario. The lady doesn't give a shit and says, \"Well, you've seen the Doctor and have to pay.\" when I wasn't even asking about a refund, I was asking about how I was going to breath. I figure, 'fuck these people' and drive to a family members house some 30 minutes away and get an inhaler from them. (I could have done this to start, but I was trying to be independent and didn't want to show up unannounced that late.)\n\nSkip forward to the next week and I'm looking at this bill (keep in mind that it was a dozen years ago and in New Zealand currency) and it was about a hundred bucks. I decided that I would have some fun if I was going to pay it. I went to my bank and withdrew the total sum in 5 cent pieces... 2000 little silver coins.\n\nAt this point I really wish it was like the cartoons and I had a white bag with a $ sign.... maybe next time.\n\nI put the coins into a beanie so it doesn't look like I've intentionally tried to screw them and drive to the pharmacy. I walk in the door and put the hat on the counter and the noise of the coins sounds brilliant. The receptionist was aghast and asked what it was. I said it was my collection of 5 cent pieces and that it was probably... roughly... one hundred bucks, and that they might want to count it.\n\nThe receptionist accepted that it was probably the full amount and didn't bother counting it.\n\nWhat was the reason she wasn't going to count out one coin until two thousand coins? Well, In 2006 the 5 cent pieces went out of circulation in New Zealand currency and, before they did, that clinic was donating every single 5 cent coin to Plunket, which is a charity that looks after the new born babies and children of New Zealand.\n\nTL;DR Instead of paying a large bill for a service that wasn't received, I managed to pay it to a children's charity instead.\n\nEdit: A lot of people have mentioned that you can decline payment of so many coins and that it is not 'legal tender'. The idea of legal tender is an odd one. Basically, if you purchase goods or receive services you become the 'debtor' and the seller is the 'creditor'. You can offer to make payment on that debt and the creditor can refuse if it doesn't meet their terms. This does, however, mean that because you have offered payment and it has been refused, it cannot be reclaimed in a court of law. Therefore, the creditor has little choice but to accept the terms of payment from the debtor. 'Tender' refers to the act of the debtor to take steps to complete the payment required to conclude a contract, such as offering coins as means of payment to complete their side of a sales contract. It is a unilateral act of the debtor meaning it is an act that the debtor makes to rectify the payment owed to the creditor. \n\nTL;DR basically, if you go into a store and try to pay with a shitload of coins, they can tell you to get fucked. But, if you have already received the goods and attempt to settle a debt, they must accept any payment offered or forfeit their ability to reclaim debts in court.\n\n[Source (Reserve Bank of New Zealand)](https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/ReserveBank/Files/Publications/Bulletins/2007/2007sep70-3mcbride.pdf)",

The one who makes everyone's life miserable just for their own enjoyment.   This isn't my malicious compliance, but that of the city council I reside in. \n\nNeighbour lady unfortunately has a bus zone that impedes *some* of her kerbside parking, however she has ample driveway space, lawn and carport to park her single vehicle in. I conceded very quickly to not park in the one car length of kerb we shared because of the abusive notes I kept finding on my wind screen (To the tune saying the space needs to be kept free for her use only). No big deal, I have four car space lengths of kerb parking, that spot was just easier to pull into. \n\nHer complaint was that during school times people would park in \"her\" spot to drop off/pick up kids. Not her driveway. Not her lawn. Just the kerb. So she got out the handy yellow spray paint and painted her own \"no standing\" zone. If anyone would park there she called the council to have them ticketed (they ignored her) If she saw the car as a repeat offender she would call the school and berate them until the perp was found to move their car. \n\nAfter many, many, harassing calls to the council they came out to inspect this \"no Parking zone\" people where having so much trouble with. Pressure washed off her paint. \n\nAnd erected a nice bright \"No Standing Zone at any time\" sign the length of her property. \n\nNo Parking for you now lady. \n\nEdited to add: she wanted to park her car, and that of any guests she may have, there. All day every day. She named it her \"guest parking\".\n\nEdit 2. Clarification and TLDR my apologies fellow Redditors. I rushed a good story and left many confused. ",

This job was full  of mostly female high school graduates who were making a career out of it.  All but two were very nice and helpful.\n\nMy trainer (one of the three men there) was retired military and thought he ran the place. I grew up on a army base and played college football so I figured we would get along fine. I was wrong.\n\nI was made to feel stupid for asking him questions so I spent most of my day figuring things out.  Before we fo further I need to explain the job.\n\nLets say your an employer or apartment/rental owner who needs background ran on a potential employee or renter. You would send us the application, we would then run criminal, credit and employment/ rental history checks.  Lots of social security numbers floating around (this was in the 90s).\n\nAnyway, about a month in I get called to the managers office due to a complaint of me talking to the women too often. I was dumbfounded because I had to ask for help and no conversation was ever about anything else.  Then a couple weeks later it happens again and that time I was told ‚Äústop talking and do your job‚Äù.\n\nMy job was data entry.  Put all information in the system accurately so the applications can move to the screeners.  Now, my mom used to make us practice Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing every night for an hour before bed. I could type my ass off.   So I stopped asking questions, put on my Sony Cd headphones and got to work.\n\nI was working the fastest I‚Äôve ever worked.  Not asking questions or even speaking to anyone anymore.   The only thing is, I wasn‚Äôt trained and basically was flying in the dark on most things.  So needless to say I fucked up a ton of applications. Requesting criminal when it wasn‚Äôt requested on the application. Requesting credit when it wasn‚Äôt requested on the applications. And if you have ever ran criminal history checks in California, there are a ton of name matches that could be the wrong person. I didn‚Äôt have access to the total report so I could only see names, no date of birth and no social.\n\nAfter two weeks I had caused so much harm by doing the wrong thing that we had a total office meeting.  When we were asked what was going on everyone looked at me.  I told them that I was told to not talk anymore so I stopped asking questions and just did the best I could with no training.  My trainer, the former military guy had to correct all of my mistakes and worked a ton of overtime.  I only lasted like 3 more weeks.\n\nBONUS: I was coming off of vacation and guess who was working baggage claim at the airport! My army retiree trainer!  He was not happy to see me.",

I was supposed to clock off at 1 each night since I was only part-time. At the orange fabric store they consider it a working warehouse so they have all the powered lift equipment and I was pretty good at it, so good that after 4 years there I was the only person trained on one of the machines for my singular team stocking freight.  The OP ( think a cherry picker with a 4 foot metal platform attached for the uninformed). \n\nThe Problem :  \n\nBecause  I was in school I refused to work late evenings before tests and I would sometimes call out entirely for big exams. It was the primary use for my sick/ vacation time. My supervisor and the operations manager above me loved me so it was no problem. Until  cool bosses left. Enter Dick manager and ditsy supervisor. \n\nDick manager wanted to clean house of anyone who could think for themselves. Meaning someone like me,  ditsy supervisor wanted to be promoted quickly so she did whatever DM wanted. \n\nThe prelude and the act : \n\nDM and DS were being ridiculous one night and I had an exam the next morning. So I started getting things ready for me to do OP work. I planned on leaving at one, I talked with DS about it two weeks prior and had gotten it in writing from the store manager.  DM and DS stop me asking what I was doing, no one was leaving until everyone was done. ( we had 5 people, and got form 3 to 4 trucks a week. To say we were behind was an understatement. ). \n\nMe : I have an exam in the morning, I‚Äôm the only one who can do these tasks. I‚Äôm getting them done before I have to leave ( it‚Äôs around 11:00) \n\nDM : looks at me, says ‚Äú okay go about your business ‚Äú. \n\nI should have seen the stupidity coming.  The next day I come in and get called into the office. Dm and DS are there. \n\nDM : last night we noticed that you were doing tasks that weren‚Äôt functioning with the group, and while we didn‚Äôt explicitly say not to do them. You were asked to work freight not the OP work. \n\nMe : ‚Äúisn‚Äôt the OP just another part of the freight ? And I had an exam‚Äù looks at DS. ‚Äú you were aware, it‚Äôs on the note here and In the system ‚Äú. \n\nDS : ‚Äú while that‚Äôs true, since you‚Äôre a veteran member of the team we need you to be more proactive and showing the new guys what to do/ whose in charge. ‚Äú. \n\nDM: ‚Äú so from now on, every task must be given to you explicitly by DS. If you‚Äôre seen doing something that isn‚Äôt from her direct orders than you‚Äôre not to do it , when you finish your tasks you‚Äôre to go to her and get your next one ‚Äú \n\nMe ;  stares. ( my father was in the military, and my grandfather was a DI. I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm quite stoneface). \n\nDM: ‚Äúwe need you to sign this stating ty understand. ‚Äú \n\nIt was one of the sheets they use when doing non- firable punishments. Basically  ‚Äú‚Äùyou‚Äôve been told you‚Äôre screwing up. If you keep it up we‚Äôll use this against you later if we decide we want to be rid of you. ‚Äú‚Äù. And they stay in the computer system for 6 months. So for example you can only be late 4 times in a 6 month period. So say you‚Äôre late three times in January if you‚Äôre late before a certain date in June they‚Äôll put you on a final warning.  \n\n\nEnter the malicious compliance: \n\nIt didn‚Äôt matter what I did, I was under DS‚Äôs heels waiting for my next task the moment I was done.  If she was in a meeting with another associate I waited outside the door. If she was on lunch I waited for her to decide to take notice of me. If she was in the bathroom, guess who was right outside the door.  To top it off I made some charts and spreadsheets of my grades from when I had the good bosses and then the new situation. After reviewing them with my store manager I convinced her that under not exception am I to be kept late. So for the next 5 months I left exactly at 1:01.  If they tried to keep me later the manager called DS and DM in for a tongue lashing \n\n\nEdit :   I was super tired when I posted this. Decided I should add more context. \n\nLast October I switched from this job to the loading one. Much better job with only 1/4 the stress. Load carts and load peoples purchases. I‚Äôm in process to enlist.  After a bit we collected enough evidence on DM that when we sent the pictures and such to corporate they moved him to a lower performing store. ",

        "text": "I work as a Team Leader in a plant that relies on a large amount of robots to make parts. My job there is to make sure things are running swiftly, provide a hand to my team members when needed, and work with maintenance when they‚Äôre doing repairs. Recently I had to come in to work a few hours early for a few days and work with a different crew I‚Äôm used to because the leader on first shift was on vacation. \n\nAn employee comes up to me and asks me for assistance with a robot. A setting got turned off on the robot somehow, not allowing it to run. As a team member, we are only supposed to do the most basic functions when it comes to working with robots and their pendants, the pendants are little tablets that the robots run off of. We can open and close a gripper, or retest a vision process in the camera, maybe return it to a home position, just very very simple things. It‚Äôs a set of unspoken rules that basically translates to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch it if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing.‚Äù They can‚Äôt have us not touch the pendants because some fixes are so easy it‚Äôs not worth waiting on maintenance and most of the time, nothing can really go horribly wrong as long as you‚Äôre performing a basic function. I knew this problem was beyond me so I radio‚Äôd for an electrician. \n\nThe chain of command is rather simple. Maintenance is the experts, most of the time. This time, we had a new guy come over, R, and R was new. He was very nice, and easy to work with, but he didn‚Äôt quite know everything just yet. He fumbled around the pendant for awhile. He set it down for a minute, and I recalled noticing a menu on the robots pendant that may be of importance to him, so, without editing any data or changing any settings, I pointed him to the menu and with him over my shoulder I opened it. I set the pendant back down and let him go to work. \n\nR decides he‚Äôs not too sure on this issue, the menu was correct but he was unsure about data values, so he brings in B as Backup. B gets over to us, and I‚Äôm watching them work as I‚Äôm supposed to. All of a sudden, B asks me: ‚ÄúAre you an electrician?‚Äù\n\nI tell him ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm the Team Leader here.‚Äù\n\nB replies with ‚ÄúWell then don‚Äôt touch my fucking pendant‚Äù\n\nI explained to him that I didn‚Äôt change anything and all I did was open a menu, but all he said was ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even gotta do that. This pendant is OUR job‚Äù\n\nUnderstood. I walked to each station and team member and told them that they are not allowed to touch any of the pendants at all for any reason because they are not electricians, until your shift is over and B gets the hell outta my department. A robot would run into an issue where it was as simple as pressing 2 buttons, but I had them call for electricians. You need a gripper opened to release a part? I was told not to touch, go get a radio. A robot needs to rescan a part? Don‚Äôt touch his fucking teach pendant!\n\nThere was well over 30 calls to maintenance in the last two hours of that shift, and a majority of them was really quick fixes, something anybody could do. Some R had to deal with, unfortunately, but he heard what his backup told me, and some B took care of. We kept them busy, and it was a lot less fixes I had to do. ",

He ran a small coffee shop/convenience store, and the thing with pricing in China/Malaysia/etc. back then is that there were actually two prices for every given item - a local price, and an ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù price. The local price was always cheaper. \n\nSo one day some occupying soldiers walk into my grandpa‚Äôs store and buy some food (coffee, simple snacks, stuff like that). My grandpa gives them the higher price because they‚Äôre obviously not locals, and the soldiers are like ‚ÄúYour prices are too high. The most you can sell anything here is for a dollar.‚Äù \n\nNow obviously none of the locals are happy with these soldiers randomly coming in and taking charge, my grandpa included. He totally could have given them the local, cheaper prices, but he decides to comply exactly with their demands. After all, who wants to piss off the armed soldiers? \n\nSo he changes the non-local price of everything to a dollar. \n\nKeep in mind the locals are still paying the same price for everything that they always have, it‚Äôs only the soldiers that pay a dollar for everything he sold. 15 cent cup of coffee? Now costs a dollar! 50 cent snack? That‚Äôll be a dollar, please! \n\nAs far as I know the soldiers never caught on, so whenever this story is told everyone has a good laugh about it. ",

        "text": "Some of you may be familiar with my older, previous posts. ¬†In those, I'm a lawyer. In this one, however, I'm a hobbyist. ¬†In my spare time for a few years, I was a football referee for high schools and local kids teams (called Pop Warner here, not sure if that's nationwide).\n\n\nThere are a few things to know about this sort of gig before we get into the stories. ¬†First, there's a pretty famous trope about coaches getting into it with, and yelling at, the refs. ¬†It happens everywhere, it's just part of the game. We know it, they know it, we just go with it. Some of these coaches are cool and give you the side-eye grin when they aren't screaming, to let you know that they understand it's just a game. ¬†Others, however, get legitimately furious and occasionally cross the line. These stories are about the second kind.\n\n\nAlso, there are a couple different philosophies on rules enforcement in football on this level. ¬†This isn't the NFL, neither us nor the kids are on that level. So, for the most part, officials have a \"don't throw the flag unless you have to\" policy. ¬†We try to let the kids play, and only flag eggregious or safety violations, or things that are blatant to the entire field or have a huge impact on the play.\n\n\nThe first story involves a high school team. ¬†Me and my crew show up pretty early, as is the custom. ¬†We watch the teams practice, check out the field, go over our procedures for the night, etc. ¬†I'm a line judge in this game, which means I'll be on the home team coach's sideline all night. ¬†My whitehat (the referee proper, and leader of the crew) is a very experienced official and is pretty cool about the \"soft\" rules enforcement. ¬†\n\n\nOne of the first things I noticed when I was scouting the field early is that this home team is playing with green jerseys and green numbers. ¬†They sorta look like they are going for an Oregon Ducks theme. The numbers don't contrast very well at all, and that's technically a violation of the equipment rules. ¬†The number have to stand out clearly from the background color on the jersey. None of us care, though I did mention to one of the practice coaches that they should consider changing it, could cause problems if they are in the playoffs or something (they won't be). ¬†\n\n\nAnyway, the game starts and the kids are playing more or less normally. ¬†A head coach for the home team though, man he's in my ear about every little hold and hit that he sees, all game long. ¬†I tell him more than once that I call what I see, and he really starts to get on fire. At some point, he screams a pretty nasty insult about how blind I must be not to see these blatant holds, and accuses me of taking a bribe for the other team. ¬†Good grief man.\n\n\nAt the next stoppage of play, I run up to my referee. ¬†I say, man, this coach won't lay off. He really, really wants us to call every little thing. ¬†Everything we see, I guess. My referee isn't an idiot. For one, he's well aware of what the coach has been doing all game long, he can see me over there struggling with the guy. ¬†Secondly, he's more than aware of the jersey issue, even though nobody brought it up.\n\n\nSo he sends all the kids over to their sideline. ¬†The coach doesn't get it, and comes out to the middle of the field, where all of the officials are gatehred around in our little zebra huddle. ¬†Coach is raising hell, why did you send my kids off?\n\n\nMy referee turns to the Umpire, whose job it is to enforce equipment violations, and says:\n\n\nR: \"Man I just noticed this, but these jerseys look a little hard to read. ¬†I was trying to get a number on that last play, but couldn't. I think it's impacting my ability to call the plays. ¬†Do these numbers look legal to you?\"\n\n\nU: \"They sure don't. ¬†Supposed to be clear and distinctive against the background. ¬†Looks almost the same color to me. Definitely having an impact on my ability to call the game.\"\n\n\nCoach: \"What? ¬†Wait...\"\n\n\nR: \"Sorry coach, looks like a very strict enforcement of the rule book is going to have all your kids on the bench for an equipment violation. ¬†And if you can't field at least (x number) of legally equipped players, you forfeit by default. That's what you came over here to discuss, right coach? ¬†You want to point out that we need to enforce every little rule violation?\"\n\n\nCoach: \"No, I uh...\"\n\n\nThe coach then gets this panicked look on his face when he realizes how deeply he's piled the shit on his team, and just how out of line he's being. ¬†He then sputters out something like \"cmon man, let's just play some football\" and my referee basically says \"yea that's what we're trying to do.\"\n\n\nI didn't hear a word out of that coach for the rest of the game. ¬†Not. One. Sound.\n\n",

        "text": "I'm a truck driver.  More specifically, I drive a concrete mixer.  That means a large part of my job is dealing with people who know nothing about the material, nothing about my equipment, but still think they know better than me, since I'm obviously just an evil-smelling, gap-toothed hillbilly who didn't graduate high school.  In short, concrete is what happens when Malicious Compliance goes for a drunken joyride down the Dunning-Kruger Parkway.  \n  \nSo, on this particular day, I was pouring at a school out in the middle of nowhere.  Our plant was the closest one to the jobsite, but it was still a half-hour away.  It was also over 110 degrees (schools usually do their renovation and repair work in summer).  The order indicated that they were going to use a concrete pump, and the manager (we will call him Bob) told me to throw in some fiber.  There are a few different kinds of fiber we use, but the only one that works with a trailer pump consists of small squares woven out of a cotton-like material that come apart in the mix.  I throw that in, because it's a pump job.\n  \nSo we get onto the jobsite, and start pumping.  Everything is going well for the first couple yards.  Then the pump's reducer (a pipe running across the front of the pump) snaps, swing out and slams into my foot.  I wasn't hurt, but it turned out the pumper knew the pipe was getting thin and ran with it anyways.  Now I'm pissed; those pumps operate at massive pressures, and I have seen them blow concrete hard enough to knock a man over 20 feet away.  If I hadn't been wearing steel toes, it very well might have broken something.  \n  \nEventually, the customer comes over, to see what the problem is.  He looks down at the pile of concrete dripping out the broken pipe, prods it with his foot, and asks, \"Where is the fiber we ordered?\"  I explain that the buckeye fiber can't be seen after it mixes into the concrete, but assure him that I added it personally.  He then starts yelling at me.  He didn't order buckeye fiber, he ordered plastic fibers.  He pulls out his paperwork, and sure enough, that is what he ordered.  I admit it was a mistake, but also tell him that the fibers he ordered won't work with the pump he is using.  The inspector tries to explain that what he got is as good or better than what he ordered, and he is willing to sign off on the change.  Customer isn't hearing any of it.  We finish the load, and the customer orders another ten yards.  I call it in, adding the bit about the broken pipe and that the customer was upset that the first load had buckeye in it instead of plastic fiber; Bob can hear the guy swearing at me over the radio.  \n  \nNow Bob tends to be very protective of his drivers.  He is also more than willing to let customers hang themselves with their own lack of knowledge.  I once watched him batch about $1,400 of liquid stupid, because a customer ordered concrete with both an accelerator and a retardant in it.  Bob could have loaded another truck right there and then, and shipped it out.  Instead, he noted that only one truck was scheduled for that job, and waited for me to drive the half-hour back to the plant.  Then he batched the load (with plastic fibers) and brought the ticket down personally.  As he handed me the ticket, he said, \"Don't forget, they ordered at a 4-inch slump.\"  \n  \nConcrete slump is a measure of how wet it is.  It's measured by packing it into a 12-inch tall cone, setting it on the ground, pulling the cone off and checking how far the pile of concrete dropped (slumped).  4-inch is something of a default order, but the only things you pour that dry are footings and curbs, and you don't put it that dry into a trailer pump.  \n  \nSo I load up and drive back to the job.  By now, they have been sitting out there for over an hour in 110-degree heat.  The pumper is panicking, because the concrete is setting inside his pump, and the patch of sidewalk they are doing is going to have a great big cold joint (fresh concrete poured against set concrete makes a weak joint that is more likely to crack) down the middle of it.  As soon as the concrete reaches the back of the drum, the pumper tells me to stop and add a bunch of water.  The inspector authorizes 10 gallons.  It's still dryer than the pumper wants, but the inspector won't allow more.  Then the concrete hits the pump's grate.  Everything is fine for a couple seconds, then it just starts piling up without going through.  All those plastic fibers were getting caught on the grating and clogging it up.  The gravel can't get through with the fiber blocking things up, so all that is getting pumped is cement and water.  \n  \nCustomer comes out furious.  He accuses Bob of spiking the load with extra fiber and tries to reject the load.  I point out that we warned him the load would not be pumpable, and besides that, by having me add water to the load, they have already bought it.  So now we are pumping a few seconds, clearing the grate, then pumping a little more.  It took about three hours (which translated to about $300 of standby charges).  Most of the fiber didn't go through the pump (the pumper didn't want me throwing the giant clots of plastic in his hopper), along with quite a bit of the gravel.  The inspector ended up taking a couple samples from the pump hose (normally they only sample at the truck chute), because he knew what was going into the form wasn't what was coming out of my truck.  A month later, when those extra samples failed their 28-day test, the school had to tear out that sidewalk and redo the whole thing.  This time, they ordered it with buckeye fibers.  \n  \nTL/DR: Customer started swearing because I accidentally gave him what the job needed instead of what he asked for.  Brought back a second load the way he ordered it, and it made the entire job fail inspection.  Also made a pumper whose poorly maintained equipment nearly injured me stand out in 110 degree heat for several hours.",

        "text": "*Quick preface: After reading some of the comments I‚Äôd like to state that this story is in no way indicative of what M√©xico is like every day. I‚Äôve travelled frequently to and from the country for the better part of the last ten years and this is the first time anything of the sort has happened to me. Mexico is an awesome place that is nothing like what you see or read in the news. Unfortunate things happen everywhere! I love M√©xico and the people there and will defend it and them at every opportunity I get &lt;3*\n\nI‚Äôm currently spending a few weeks visiting my in-laws in M√©xico. My wife, daughter and I took my in-law‚Äôs car to go get some groceries from the *tianguis* (street market) and turned down a road that leads right to it. No sooner had I done this, and a police officer on his motorcycle pulled me over.\n\n(Now, it‚Äôs very obvious by both the color of my skin as well as my accent that I am most definitely not Mexican, nor from any Latin American country for that matter. Mildly important for the story.)\n\nPolice Officer: ‚Äú*Joven*, this road is one direction only. When the market is here, you can‚Äôt drive this way on the road.‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚ÄúOh, sorry. I didn‚Äôt know that.‚Äù\n\nPO: ‚ÄúCan I see your license please?‚Äù\n\nI, unfortunately, didn‚Äôt have my wallet on me. The tianguis is cash-only, so I didn‚Äôt bother. This also meant that I didn‚Äôt have my license on me either, which was 100% my bad.\n\nMe: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry officer, but I left it at the house‚Äù\n\nPO: ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs two tickets - one for driving the wrong way, and the other for not having your license on you. I‚Äôm going to have to ticket you, and as a guarantee that you‚Äôll go pay it I will have to take your license plates.‚Äù\n\nI had never heard this before. Turns out that while taking license plates (or even drivers licenses) as collateral for traffic infractions is common practice in M√©xico, it is also sometimes used as leverage to get you to pay a *mordida*, or a bribe, to the officer to let you off, especially if you‚Äôre a foreigner.\n\nSo, I decided to call his bluff and comply.\n\nMe: ‚ÄúOkay officer, you can take my plates. When should I go see the judge to pay my tickets and get my plates back?‚Äù\n\nPO: (a bit taken aback) ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt really know. It could be a while.‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm happy to go pay my fines if she is back before Thursday, because that‚Äôs when my flight leaves.‚Äù\n\n*Awkward silence while I wait for him to pull out a screwdriver and start removing the car‚Äôs license plate*\n\nPO: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know.‚Äù\n\n*Another awkward silence while I still wait for him to take my plates*\n\nMe: ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm the one who broke the law, so go ahead and take my plates.‚Äù\n\nThe officer walked away for a minute and pulled another car over that came down the same road as us. I think that during the time he realized I wasn‚Äôt going to pay a mordida and that the tickets he was threatening were probably just more paperwork than he was willing to do, because when he came back:\n\nPO: ‚ÄúYou know what, I‚Äôm just going to let you go with a warning.‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚ÄúAwesome! Thanks officer!‚Äù\n\nTL;DR - Police officer in my wife‚Äôs hometown pulls me over and threatens to take my license plates in order to convince me to bribe him. I tell him to take my plates. He lets me off with a warning.\n\nEdit: Corrected and updated some aspects of the story thanks to several helpful people in the comments and added and the preface after reading some other people‚Äôs comments.",

        "text": "My friend lives in a homeowner's association and they have a very strict rule on lawn ornaments and decorating.  They have banned pink flamingos on their own, this is important later, and for Christmas they require the house to have a theme.  My friend was looking for a way to screw with them and I found it for him in the Bahamas.\n\nThe theme he chose was Christmas in Paradise, he sold it to the association by saying it would be bright colors to off-set the dreary winter we were having.  They enthusiastically approved it, they had no idea.\n\nHe found some plastic palm trees, borrowed nine of a friend's pink flamingos and built a sled for Santa.  The flamingos had reindeer antlers and the one in front had a red nose stuck on.  It looked something like [this](http://www.kassj.com/etcetera/xmas/pinkimages/santateam.jpg).  The reigns for his flamingos were lights not bells.  He also had lights on the house and fake palms and a sign that said Christmas in Paradise.  The HOA couldn't do anything because I had found a painting in the Bahamas that inspired the whole set up and bought it for the friend with the flamingo collection and it fit in with his theme.",

        "text": "Crosspost from /r/prorevenge\n\nSometime back, there was a concentrated effort to sabotage and, hopefully eliminate hunting in the Western States.\n\nAnti-hunting protesters would insist on access to hunting areas and follow you out on your hunt, make as much noise as they could to disturb the animals, and if you EVER put your rifle on your shoulder (like to look through the scope) the nearest protester would jump in front of the weapon screaming \"Don't shoot. Don't shoot.\" while his accomplices filmed you. They then would swear you threatened them and would try to prefer charges.\n\nIt was a total shit show, exactly what they wanted.\n\nSoooooo, opening day, dozens of plaid clad armed citizens show up to go \"hunting\". Protesters are spread a bit thin, but they're focused!\n\nStart out at first light, following several parallel mountain valleys that slowly climb into the timber.\n\nLoud noise from protesters, disgusted looks from plaid clad citizens. Hour goes by.\n\nWe reach a predesignated location and stop. Check watches. (tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, ...)\n\nEvery plaid clad citizen finds a vantage point overlooking the valley, removes their rifle from their shoulder and aims down the valley.\n\nSchreeches like banshees from hell erupt from our Birkenstock wearing escorts as they fly ahead of the guns to warn Bambi and friends if the danger.\n\n\"Boom....Book...Boom\", shots ring out, BUT FROM ABOVE THE VALLEY.........where the REAL hunters are.\n\nWe, the plaid clad citizens, are not hunters, we are decoys for protesters. There's not a bullet for any of our weapons, no tag for deer, some didn't have hunting licenses.\n\nThe hunters have been in place since last night, waiting for game to appear.\n\nThe protesters? They just participated in an (illegal) game drive.\n\nNot us now, we just went for a walk. Hunters were legally hunting. Protesters made it all possible.\n\nWe thanked them immensely and offered to go view the day's kill and get them a picture with the trophy.\n\nThey had to go home.\n\nThanks boys.\n\nTLDR.  Hunt protesters insist on being given equal access to hunting areas so they can disrupt hunting.  Use their antics to make the hunt possible.",

I hope it still belongs in this sub.\n\nIn some places in Germany it is still custom to have a minimum purchase amount (usually 10‚Ç¨) to be able to pay by credit or debit card. While that makes sense in small businesses (due to fees) it's rather silly for large chains, though. \n\nNow i was at a large electronics chain (MediaMarkt for those who know it) and was buying something for 9,99‚Ç¨ and didn't have cash on me. Then the following dialogue ensued\n\nCashier: \"Sorry, minimum purchase value is 10‚Ç¨ for card payment\"\n\nMe: \"Oh come on, it's a cent difference!\"\n\nCashier: \"Sorry, can't do. Rules are rules\"\n\nMe: \"This is silly\"\n\nCashier not even gonna acknowledge that it is silly because rules are rules..\n\nMe: \"Say, what's your return policy?\"\n\nCashier: \"30 Days, you have to return it to the information desk\"\n\nMe: \"Okay. So we have a choice now. Either i purchase that TV you have on sale over there and immediately return it, or you swipe my card\"\n\nCashier: \"Ok you win\"",
