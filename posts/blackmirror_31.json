The rest of them I'm not sure because people describing scary ones to me mention national anthem which I don't think was scary at all. I know entire history of you is disturbing but I didn't find it scary. I only found that one moment when she was walking through the house looking for the robot scary. I started white bear but chickened out. Can anyone offer some insight? Which ones have actual scary scenes like jump scary, and aren't just scary in a disturbing sense like national anthem?",

        "text": "This is something I’ve been thinking about for the past few days and it seems like there could be something interesting out of it.\n\nIn order for this concept to work, you have to rely on three things presented throughout the show.\n\n1.  Cookies can inhabit and interact with the outside world via inanimate objects. (Black Museum)\n2. You can buy androids that function like a deceased person using AI and background information. (Be Right Back)\n3. The whole series is loosely tied together and is potentially in the same universe. (Almost every episode has callbacks or hints that it’s in the same universe. Also Black Museum)\n\nTying all of these things together, it would be an interesting concept to see what would happen if a cookie was inserted into one of these androids. Many, many conclusions can be drawn from this simple idea and I will also try to explain how this could function within the Black Mirror universe.\n\nBlack Mirror already touches upon immortality in a way during “San Junipero”. The cookies drawn from the dying patients are then taken and stored in a huge data bank for the consciousnesses. Let’s take this one step further and store the consciousnesses in the androids’ “brains”. Since these androids presented in “Be Right Back” don’t seem to deteriorate or need much to function, the consciousnesses put in the androids would be functionally immortal. \n\nWhat does this mean, though? Would the rich and powerful want to monopolize this tech to live longer and also to create a new race of humans? Potentially.\n\nWhat if these “immortal” androids decide to extinguish any possibility of humans becoming like them? This could be a bit of a stretch but \nwe have already seen extinction level events in both “Men Against Fire” and “Metalhead”.  There was a reason why the soldiers were killing normal humans, and this could be an answer.\n\nAnother idea is that there needs to be something done with the human bodies after a cookie is placed in the Android. What if the people pedaling in “15 Million Merits” are the human duplicates? \n\nThere is bound to be some sort of tension because these two entities will be almost exactly the same. The two could fight for who remains or the two could live harmoniously. Or, there could be a person who creates hundreds of duplicates of him/herself. There could even be crime organizations who steal cookies and place them in androids in order for the Android to commit a crime, thus framing the human.\n\nThis concept is very intriguing and could make for a great episode.",

        "text": "It's something they allude to, but never explicitly say. But here's the truth. It's the truth from the first reveal of the cookie, all the way to Black Museum and Carrie.\n\nConsciousness cannot be transferred. It is only copied. Brains are scanned, and consciousness are digitally reconstructed.\n\nWhen Kelly and Yorkie are living and logged on to San Junipero, the device is directly reading and signalling back to their brain. It's \"them\" enough, in the same way that your hearing a person's voice through a phone. You're not *really* hearing their actual voice. Just the digital reconstruction.\n\nThe show goes back and forth, in one moment saying that they'll be transferred to the cloud, and in another saying cookies really are just a digital copy. I always interpreted it to always be just copying rather than full magica sci-fi transference. And then we learn in Black Museum that indeed, the explicit \"copy only\" technology of the \"cookie\" is one and the same as the \"afterlife\" tech of San Junipero.\n\nConsider the sinister look the curator gives Carrie's body after she's \"transferred\" to Jack. It could easily mean any number of things, but I choose to believe that it's his private moment realizing the \"Real\" carrie is still in there. In a way, that's an \"ace in the hole\" mindfuck they can still use, given all this time they've been saying that consciousness is truly \"transferred\". Anyone who's played SOMA remembers \"the coin toss\".\n\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n* It means San Junipero isn't an afterlife at all. It's basically a museum of AIs all programmed to copy the deceased. Maybe even worse, because even if there *is* a real soul and afterlife, the perfect, sentient reconstructions of those people are denied that. They won't move on. If the plug is pulled by TCKR, they're gone-gone in the way their living counterparts always feared.\n\n* It means Carrie went through the procedure to go into Jack's mind, and in the end was still stuck in her body confused and scared why everyone around her seemed to think that it \"worked\".\n\n* It means the daughter in Black Museum is just carrying around a clone of her mom in her head.\n\n* It also means Kelly's debate of whether to \"move\" to a San Junipero was foundationally flawed. There's no \"moving\" at all. The only decision is, \"Do I leave behind a copy of myself to live on, to please other copies of other people? Kelly is still going to die no matter what. But a copy of her will have the experience and memory of \"cheating death\".\n\nThere's not much to this, honestly. Only a few episodes dealt with it at all. And in many ways it's irrelevant. I can concede that the clone is 100% indistinguishable to the outsider, perfect in every way, no flaws. And I'll even concede that the reconstruction honestly \"believes\" it is real, to the degree that mistreating it would be cruel. However, I'll eat my shoe if Black Mirror season 5 doesn't borrow from SOMA and lean into this concept. It's too ripe a fruit not to pick.",

For some reason, the idea of VR lesbians just didn't grab me and I have eschewed it for the last two years; befuddled and bemused when it became an award-winner.\n\nHowever, I dipped my toe back into the water yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I found, to my initial shame, that I completely mistook the episode initially, missing out on so many vital points and emotions.\n\nSo, my point is this: Has anyone ever got the completely wrong impression of an episode the first time around and then after revision discovered it to be different?

        "text": "I wanted to get kind of a consensus idea of what Black Mirror episodes are generally the \"best\", as determined by consensus.\n\nI found these three articles:\n\n[pcmag](https://www.pcmag.com/feature/358305/every-episode-of-black-mirror-ranked-from-best-to-worst)\n\n[Vulture](http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/every-black-mirror-episode-from-worst-to-best.html)\n\n[Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a49919/black-mirror-episodes-ranked/)\n\nI expected that these rankings would totally confirm my bias that \"USS Callister\" is the best Black Mirror episode and \"National Anthem\" was the worst, but alas, it was not to be.\n\nThe best rated episode (with very little disagreement) was \"Be Right Back.\" Second best was \"San Junipero\", and third was \"National Anthem\" (to my puzzlement).\n\nI also ranked the episodes by \"controversy\". The most \"controversial\" episodes are the ones on which there is the most disagreement. The most \"controversial\" episode was \"White Christmas.\" Vulture ranks it 7th, PC Mag rates it 2nd, and Esquire ranks it 17th. The least \"controversial\" was \"Black Museum,\" which was rated 16th, 15th, and 16th, respectively (again, this was surprising to me: I would have put it in the top ten). \"Be Right Back\" is the 3rd least controversial, which tells me that it's a pretty strong consensus. My favorite, \"USS Callister,\" was the 4th most controversial - PC Mag and Vulture liked it, but Esquire did not.\n\n[Here is a link to the full results.](https://imgur.com/jIdwIyl)\n\nThis was an interesting exercise, but ultimately, I feel like a sample size of 3 is pretty small. I would be interested to see what the results would be if I got a much bigger sample size. So, I made a survey that the users of /r/blackmirror are invited to fill out. The format is a bit different - instead of ranking from your favorite to your least favorite, you just rank every episode from 1 to 10, 1 meaning you hated it and 10 meaning you loved it. Assuming this post gets any attention, I will make another post, complete with graphs, letting you guys know the consensus rankings, as well as the most controversial episodes.\n\n[Here is a link to the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GgSG7ST2-2AoNI21pvIHbBlUh8xshBgkpxce9iihMt8). If there's an episode you haven't seen, then you can just skip ranking that one.\n\nOf course you could go in there over and over again and rank your favorite episode with a 10 and all the others with a 1, but that would ruin the fun of the whole thing. I considered requiring everyone to sign in so that they can only vote once, but it's supposed to be fun, so hopefully everyone keeps it fun.",

        "text": "I wanted to get kind of a consensus idea of what Black Mirror episodes are considered the \"best\".\n\nI found these three articles:\n\n[pcmag](https://www.pcmag.com/feature/358305/every-episode-of-black-mirror-ranked-from-best-to-worst)\n\n[Vulture](http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/every-black-mirror-episode-from-worst-to-best.html)\n\n[Esquire](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a49919/black-mirror-episodes-ranked/)\n\nI expected that these rankings would totally confirm my bias that \"USS Callister\" is the best Black Mirror episode and \"National Anthem\" was the worst, but alas, it was not to be.\n\nThe best rated episode (with very little disagreement) was \"Be Right Back.\" Second best was \"San Junipero\", and third was \"National Anthem\" (to my puzzlement).\n\nI also ranked the episodes by \"controversy\". The most \"controversial\" episodes are the ones on which there is the most disagreement. The most \"controversial\" episode was \"White Christmas.\" Vulture ranks it 7th, PC Mag rates it 2nd, and Esquire ranks it 17th. The least \"controversial\" was \"Black Museum,\" which was rated 16th, 15th, and 16th, respectively (again, this was surprising to me: I would have put it in the top ten). \"Be Right Back\" is the 3rd least controversial, which tells me that it's a pretty strong consensus best. My favorite, \"USS Callister,\" was the 4th most controversial - PC Mag and Vulture liked it, but Esquire did not.\n\n[Here is a link to the full results.](https://imgur.com/jIdwIyl)\n\nThis was an interesting exercise, but ultimately, I feel like a sample size of 3 is pretty small. I would be interested to see what the results would be if I got a much bigger sample size. So, I made a survey that the users of /r/blackmirror are invited to fill out. The format is a bit different - instead of ranking from your favorite to your least favorite, you just rank every episode from 1 to 10, 1 meaning you hated it and 10 meaning you loved it. Assuming this post gets any attention, I will make another post, complete with graphs, letting you guys know the consensus rankings, as well as the most controversial episodes.\n\n[Here is a link to the survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GgSG7ST2-2AoNI21pvIHbBlUh8xshBgkpxce9iihMt8). If there's an episode you haven't seen, then you can just skip ranking that one.\n\nOf course you could go in there over and over again and rank your favorite episode with a 10 and all the others with a 1, but that would ruin the fun of the whole thing. I considered requiring everyone to sign in so that they can only vote once, but it's supposed to be fun, so hopefully everyone keeps it fun.",
