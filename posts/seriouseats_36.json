        "text": "I was wondering if any of you guys know of any good books, websites, or databases that would have a good amount of detail or information on the different individual varieties of hot chili peppers that are used in Chinese cuisine. I’d be fine with information on chili peppers used in any of the recognized regional cuisines although I’m assuming some such as Hunan and Sichuan would likely have more than others. \n\nI’m not sure if I’m just an idiot or terrible at searching for things online, but I’ve been pretty surprised at the lack of information that I’ve come across, with most sites referring simply to either the Tianjin (also spelled phonetically as ‘Tsin Tsin’ or ‘Tien Tsin’), the ‘facing heaven’ (chaotianjiao), or the Er Jing Tiao chili peppers. I’m not sure if the issue is that any relevant information would all be in Chinese (which I can’t speak or read) or what, but I’ve been getting foiled at just about every turn. I’ve checked online for what some English-language Chinese cuisine experts like Fuchsia Dunlop have to say and sites like http://themalaproject.com/ and http://thewoksoflife.com/ but I still haven’t found much and I’d love whatever info any of you might have! I keep reading articles that mention “the countless varieties of chilis used in Chinese cooking” so I just find it strange that I’ve only been abel to identify like 4 or 5. Anyway, I appreciate whatever help you have, thanks! \n",

They were soggier than wet pancakes reheated in a microwave! Has anyone else had success with these or am I crazy?\n\nI used all fresh ingredients, including recently purchased flour, baking powder, and baking soda. I weighed all of the ingredients according to the grams listed. I didn't substitute any of the ingredients, in fact, I went out to the grocery store to make sure I had the exact ingredients called for. I tried cooking on various temperatures on my waffle iron, I just could not get anything but limp, chewy, deflated texture. The exterior browned very nicely and the shape looked fine until I pulled it out of the iron, it immediately went limp like a tortilla in my tongs. I think that if I threw the waffle against the wall it would probably stick. \n\nI believe that my equipment and technique are fine, but with such a fail it's hard to not want to blame myself. Do flops exist on the Serious Eats website or does anyone have any suggestions for me? This is the second recipe I've tried from Serious Eats so I am pretty new to the site and the recipe authors. \n\nThanks!",

All the folks whose other recipes I loved seemed to love it, it was all over Serious Eats, Lucky Peach, etc. But I had a bottle at home and never used it. It tasted like sour nothing, not the umami bomb people talked about, just... nothing.\n\nAnd then one day, after having [Kenji's 30 Minute Pho](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/how-to-make-30-minute-pressure-cooker-pho-ga-vietnamese-chicken-noodle-soup.html) at a party, I was looking through the comments - my pressure cooker is lent out and I was hoping for info on making it in a normal pot. At the end of the first page of comments, there was [a comment from the author himself](http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/how-to-make-30-minute-pressure-cooker-pho-ga-vietnamese-chicken-noodle-soup.html) about fish sauce.\n\n&gt; [...] though for this particular recipe Iused the only one I could find in Bogotá: Squid brand. IT's not the best (actually **close to the worst**) but still ok.\n\nSquid Brand? That's what I've always used, that's what everybody around here sells. The next time we were out, I picked up a bottle of Marks and Spencer's Fish Sauce and WOW. It's worlds apart both in smell and taste, very umami, smelling slightly of mushrooms and parmesan cheese. Amazing, delicious, went perfectly with the pho I made today. Thanks, Kenji, you made a believer out of me.",

        "text": "Hi!\n\nI've been searching for a decent wok for a long time and figured maybe people in this subreddit could help. I love cooking in a wok, but I'm always having endless problems with the pans themselves.\n\nI'm trying to avoid pans with a PTFE (Tefal) coating, as it [will deteriorate at high heat and in doing so release poisonous polymer fumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene). This seems especially true for wok pans, given that proper wokking is done at very high heat.  \n\nI've tried several brands of ceramic pans, but inevitably the coating loses effectiveness after a few months and I get large spots of black soot wherever the coating has gone. Perhaps I should find a wok without any non-stick surface at all?  \n\nI would love to hear your experience and favorite pans. Preferably specific brands / models that you've been using for years and have been happy with. Thank you!  \n  \n Edit: I should mention that I currently have a gas stove but will probably opt for an induction furnace when moving in a few years, so I'm looking for a flat bottom wok.",

I hadn't ever seen crepes served this way after eating them once or twice a month since I was a kid. I made Kenji's recipe for breakfast on Valentines day with great success but it got me thinking though that there are probably lots of interesting crepe fillings out there. Here are the two ways that we generally have them at my house both when I was a kid and now as a dad. These are generally made ahead of time with the crepe slightly undercooked and crisped up in a pan for dinner the day of. \n\nhttp://www.olgasflavorfactory.com/appetizers/savory-crepes-with-meat-filling/\n\n\nhttp://natashaskitchen.com/2013/02/09/russian-crepes-with-cheese-a-video-tutorial/\n\nCurious to hear how other people like to fill their crepes?
