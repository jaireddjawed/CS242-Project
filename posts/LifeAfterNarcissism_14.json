After having my own family not care about my emotional and mental health, I've now joined a loving &amp; caring family who does! It's like starting over. I still have a lot of anger issues to work through from my past but other than that I feel like I'm finally moving on. \n\nI just wanted to share, because I don't have many friends.

They are SO SKILLED at putting you in that sentimental fog, so you're missing them and longing to hear from them, even though your sane side knows this is a terrible idea. \n\nI dumped my second N for the second time ten days ago. I sent him an email from a throwaway account, then blocked him on my phone and social media. \n\nThe only communication line still open to him was Facebook. After a couple of hoovers that I ignored, he has now deleted me as a friend.\n\nI know him. I know that this means no more hoovers. He is going to ignore me indefinitely, bc he's oh so good at that.\n\nObviously, no more hoovers is a good thing. It means freedom from having to worry about the N contacting you.\n\nNow all I have to worry about is myself.\n\nI've relapsed once before and gone back to him. I relapsed many times with my first N ex. I find that, with No Contact, the hardest battle is internal, not anything the N might do. You have to defeat that addiction in you, the trauma bond, that makes you want to go back. This can be very, very difficult.\n\nI've had two back to back N relationships spanning 4 years, and I am TIRED. My first N was malignant, a real psycho. \n\nThe second N was covert, and more sophisticated in his methods \\- he was all about ignoring and devaluing you with little silent treatments. He liked to make you feel invisible and just not that important. He would invalidate me continuously in a lot of sneaky, small ways, like reacting to my humor with cold silence. Talking to me on the phone in a cold, indifferent tone. Taking a long time to respond to texts or phone calls. Refusing to make conversation in restaurants. Always creating the perception that he has a million things going on and just doesn't have time for you. Then you'll see him on social media, liking a bunch of posts or pics but not yours. \n\nNo more Narcissists. I am DONE. ",

        "text": "Background:\n\n30M, severe Nmom, 6 ys NC, living alone since 19y/o, complete financial independence for the best part of the last decade.\n\nI'm always on a tight budget and I do everything alone, managing every detail of my life. One bedroom appartment, bulk cooking, minimum luxuries, go everywhere by bicycle. No girlfriend, no outside help in money, labor or emotional support. The thing is that such a system, although light and manoeuvrable, has very low damage tolerance.\n\nWhat I mean: I fell off my bicycle 2 months ago and banged my wrist pretty badly. Everything went down like dominoes: I now have to take the bus to work everyday, which means 50 bucks a month in bus fare, 2 hours longer commute time, which translates to less sleep and less time to clean and cook.\n\nNo money to fix the bike immediately, and very hard to save up because all my extra money go on public transport and the occasional takeout meal.\n\nLess energy and happiness because not only I love cycling but it's the only form of exercise I get. Gotten pudgy as a side effect.\n\nBike is 21 years old, too small for me, and breaks down every two months. I fix it myself with spare parts I find on ebay.\n\nIt's a carousel of \"disaster\": Cant' save up for a new bike because I have to spend surplus income to fix old bike, because I can't not have a bike for so long, but old bike is a sneeze away from crapping out at any given moment, and during downtime all other expenses grow because of no bike. So less sleep, worse food, more commute, less healthy, less happy, no time or money to do anything, see friends, have a little fun.\n\nTired, trapped, starting to get depressed about it.\n\nMy father's three sisters, who are not Ns or flying monkeys or anything, want to all sincerelly chip in and get me a new bike. They're no rich, but they know my position, they admire me for being self sufficient, and just want to help.\n\nFor the love of me just thinking about accepting a handout sends me immediately to panic mode. Fight or flight. I can't breathe. Severe PTSD reactions, Trojan Horse gifts by Nmom, oweing to people, fear of selling out etc etc\n\nI'm paralyzed.\n\n**TL,DR: In a tight financial spot, aunts offer to sincerelly help out, I jump to panic mode because I translate all external help as an attempt to control me due to years emotional abuse.**\n\nI know I shouldn't react like this, it would be a real life saver to accept this gift, a tremendous help, I would love it so much right now. And still I find myself unable to do it. I have hard wired myself to reject it. It has never been that bad.\n\nHow to overcome this? I'm starting to look like an huge idiot, making my situation worse every day, pushing them away by being stupidly proud.\n",

The family dynamic and culture has heart, excellent morality, thinking before you speak, treating people with kindness and respect, they have wealth they share, and a sense of humor. They're grounded. I mean sure, they do have some individual warts, but that family dynamic. They have a legacy they are passing on.\n\nI find myself constantly daydreaming because I don't have any frame of reference for that. What it would be like to have that or to marry into that. I love my husband and our little family, but I've cut off both my parents and all my loveable mentally ill friends just trying not to pass any of it on to my kids.

This does makes sense because why else would a 32 year old move back in with his narcissistic family who has done nothing but abuse and humiliate and disrespect him? My father passed away , but he was the most narcissistic among all and they all praise him and demonize me for standing up to him. \n\n.\n\nAnyway, right now, my goal is to make enough $ , probably save up for 6 months worth and then move out once and for all. I know I am getting old, but I still think that there is a better world out there without them or without these people being in my life ever again. I had to remove lots of negative brainwashing/gas lighting they have done to get to this point, but I am glad that I can finally see a glimmer of the light on the other end.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nI want to live a normal life with my \"authentic\" self and the only way is to cut them off. But I can't stand being lonely. The last time I left these narcissists, I was hit with a hurricane of feelings of loneliness . This led me down a really dark path of drug and alcohol addiction. I was able to overcome them, but I feel frozen just thinking about those days .\n\n\n\nAt the same time, I have to cut them off. If pathological loneliness is the withdrawal symptom that I have to go through to get to the other side, then so be it! This will be the final addiction I will be battling. No more. I don't have the energy to fight any more addictions. It's sad enough to come to the realization that my own narc family is like an addictive substance. Like a cigarette or alcohol or porn. But I will willing to go through the loneliness even though it'll test my will power one last time.\n\n\nHas anyone here gone through this feeling of deafening horrific lonely feeling when they initially left their narcissistic family ? I know this comes as a result of attachment trauma and core shame related to it(which works on a subconscious level) and which might require professional help to overcome, but how did you get to the other side?\n\nWhat kept you going even though you knew you were feeling the heavy burdens of pathological loneliness?\nI still have few more months left to save enough cash to move, but when I get to that point, I just want to be ready.

I've never spoken directly to these friends about my sister's charges against me, as they all live far away, and I feel mortified that they've bought into her smear campaign and are thinking these awful things about me.\n\nOne of the things she's said is that a married couple we've known for 20 years, were offended when the wife gave birth via C\\-section and I was \"hounding them\" afterwards to \"hang out.\" At that time I was living in the same city as them.\n\nI still have the old cell phone that I used when they had their baby back in 2015, so I powered it up and looked thru my texts with them, and phone records. Aside from congratulations, I texted the father the day after the birth, and said \"Let me know when it's a good time to come and meet \\[the baby\\]!\"\n\nWhat kind of numb skull would expect to to \"hang out\" with a new mom whose just had major surgery? My sister makes it sound like I was expecting them to entertain me. When I mentioned that I still have that old phone in my possession, she insisted on seeing it at some point so she can \"see the proof\" that I wasn't really being a nuisance to this couple, and then I can prove them all wrong.\n\nWhy do I have to prove anything to anyone? Why am I on trial in the first place?\n\nN sister loves to posture as though she's \"helping me,\" and is acting out of concern, by repeating to me the things that people are supposedly saying about me behind my back. And if I have no memory of these things, or if my memory of what happened is totally different, then she will flip it and say that I'm not being accountable and that I never think I do anything wrong. As though I'm the N!\n\nAnyway, it's very validating and helpful to bring the shit she says here, and get other people's feedback on it. It helps to invalidate her reality, which she's trying to impose on me.\n\nSo... is it a social faux pas to ask long time close friends if you can come and meet their baby? I always thought it would be rude to NOT express interest in meeting the new baby. I thought having friends &amp; family visit you at some point is just protocol.",

This partly led to my falling\\-out with our Narc Mother, who she's been imitating more lately.\n\nSaid sister recently left me a voicemail (I've now been NC with most of my family for several months, not that they've stopped trying to break that), saying she'd be leaving in 2 weeks and this was the last chance to \"buck up\" and reconcile with the whole family. \n\nMy NMum followed up with a bitter, angry email, crowing that my sister has handed in her notice, will be headed to the USA soon for a 4\\-month hiking trip with her sweetheart followed by marriage. She seems to believe that this will transition to citizenship and my sister being in the USA for the long\\-term.\n\nThe kicker is that my sister works at my relationship Partner's old workplace (my Partner got her the job), and recently this company has been in the news for making 15&amp;#37; of their staff redundant without notice period or exit interview. My sister is not an essential member of staff, having been there only a little longer than 6 months; and even in her initial tenure there they were required to extend her probation. \n\nIt is very likely she was made redundant as opposed to handing in notice. Which means either she lied to NMum, or NMum lied to me \\- and it's impossible to know which. In any case, it seems my sister is in trouble. She has been let go from a steady job and will be coming to the USA with just 6 months of savings, believing that she can gain citizenship as easy as 1\\-2\\-3.\n\nMy Partner has pointed out to me that, knowing this, we \\*could\\* check in on my sister, call her and find out if she's OK. Either she'll say \"Yes\" and possibly launch into some verbal abuse, at which point I can just say \"Cool, Bye\" and hang up, or she'll say \"No\", and I can listen to her and be there for her, slightly. And \\- more as one human being to another than as a sibling \\- I feel for her, if she's really in trouble.\n\n  \nThe one hitch is that whatever I do, it'll filter back to my NMum. And no matter what I do, her reaction will not be pretty.\n\nThoughts?",

Early last year, she finally plucked up the courage to leave the relationship and he blew up. Called him everything from a cheater to an abuser and started pinning all his problems on her. He accused her of making his mental illness worse, when he’s the one actively destroying his own life. When they had to meet again for a mutual event, he had to stay over for one night and he was forcing himself on her and took her rejection to his advances as “rude and abusive” because it hurt his feelings and he claimed that “as a survivor, I would never do anything to make you sexually uncomfortable” - yeah fucking right.\n\nShe’s moved in with me now, and it’s been a year, but he’s still a thorn at her side. My girlfriend’s an empath, someone way too kind for her own good. She remained in contact with him until about half a year ago because she wanted to stay friends and gain some closure, but every time she wrote out a long letter apologising (even though she had little to apologise for) and expressing how she felt, he would write back a long letter berating her and saying how he can’t accept her apology and saying how he won’t apologise for what he’s done because he thought it was right for him to act the way he did because she was so “abusive” (an example: he said that she was coercing him into drinking and overwhelming him when she was the one who didn’t want to drink because they had finals, and she said nothing and was just trying to stop him from hurting himself when he claimed to be “overwhelmed”). I finally convinced her that she shouldn’t have to stand for this shit, so she finally gave up and blocked him.\n\nLate last year, he fucking tried to kill himself.\n\nI can’t explain the pain he put her though, and how he tried to fucking frame her for his death by leaving shit about her in his laptop like 13 reasons why (his favourite show, of course). He survived, someone found him after he OD’d. The police were calling her and by now we’ve moved in and we’re living a few hours away by train and even after all the shit he put her and his friends through, when he came to she still decided to call him and talk to him all friendly as if nothing happened. \n\nShe said that she felt so much guilt and that if he ever successfully killed himself, she will never stop blaming herself for it.\n\nIt broke my heart to hear that. \n\nI hate him. I hate that he has this... Leash over her. I hate that he’s taking advantage of her good nature and exploiting it and making a huge fucking deal of it just because she broke up with him when I know he would have dumped her 3-5 years later when he got bored of her anyways (he even said so in one of his letters: “we could have had a good 3-5 years together” even though he claimed that she was the “love of his life”). I hate that anything that she associates with him now sets her off in panic attacks and I hate that her checking his twitter to see if he’s still alive or would ever apologise to her has become an OCD symptom for her because she gets anxiety attacks if she can’t know if he’s safe.\n\nShe’s undergoing therapy now, so I’m glad that she’s at least getting some closure from there. Everything felt like it was getting better.\n\nYesterday, after months of silence, he made a new email and sent her another message. It was like 10 pages long and started off saying some shit like how their souls are connected and how her “soul form” was hurting because of how selfish she acted, saying how he believes that she’s laughing at him, at his pains, saying how she’ll “always love him” (funny how it’s not the other way around, hm?) then went on to blame her for him trying to take his life, saying how she behaved made him do it, saying that he wasn’t responsible for trying to kill himself because she made his “soul hurt and his soul had to take action” all that bull. He then went on to say how she was the most abusive person ever and how she has ruined his life, when she’s done nothing but try and help him and it was him who shot her down again and again, became verbally abusive, gaslighting her at every turn by piling her with alcohol, abusing her, then wiping her memories of last night’s abuse and refused to talk about their problems unless she was drunk and he could gaslight her more.\n\nAfter reading the letter together, I could see all the light just drain from her eyes and she goes back into her shell of dissociation and obsessively checking his twitter. He apparently tweeted that he’s making a trip down to London where we live, and that’s setting her off even more and making me so fucking angry. A part of me wishes that he would show up at our door and I can finally beat the shit out of him, but our house is not very central london and most likely he won’t know where we live, just where she works, and I hate to think that he’d just invite himself to her work and start harassing her. \n\nI’m so sick and tired of this guy. I wish there was \n more that I could do but I don’t know what I can do. I don’t want to confront him for fear that he’ll just use this against her (he doesn’t dare get pissy with me because I can see through his shit, but he just ends up berating her more because of me as he’s done before because he knows she cares). He’s constantly threatening suicide against her and a part of me wish that someone would just lock him up already for all the threats he’s making. I’m fucking tired of seeing this piece of shit ruin the love of my life’s day and making her doubt how wonderful and loving she is and I hate that he’s broken her confidence down so much that she would much rather take his side and berate herself rather than listen to me remind her of how great she is. \n\nI don’t know what to do. We don’t know what to do. We don’t want him in our life anymore but it seems that as long as he wants to hold his own life over us, there’s nothing we can do to stop him from hurting her. Please, help. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.\n\nEdit: Spelling.\n",

I mean, when you have NO money, it's not a safe situation to be in, and I would never, ever, ask to borrow anything from friends. Even if I were dying. \n\nBasically, even though I have physical distance, I’m often broke &amp; run back to my parents (only Mom) to give me money, and then the codependency continues &amp; I can’t move on. Seeing them “take care” of me when I’m in trouble, and ten thousand miles away maintains the safety &amp; illusion of a Mom.\n\nI can’t break the cycle &amp; it’s the deepest shame. I’ve only just broken out of the thought and shame spiral that kept me from applying for jobs that were any way in my skill set &amp; related to my field and would pay enough for me to live on. \n\nThe situation’s desperate, because my my parent’s aren’t exactly rich. Fixing my life feels like picking up sand and it’s been going on years now. The constant threat of homeless looms, and I’m wondering why my classmates &amp; unit mates were all successful in some way, when I’m struggling with the basics. There’s no reason to go crying to my E Mom for cash, but I do it. It’s the only connection we have, which is truly pathetic. \n\nMaybe I just don’t want to admit there’s no one, after my N fathers abuse, grandparents death, moving countries that took me away from my home, brothers overdose &amp; behavioral issues, and other brothers absence/ignorance and distance/estrangement of his own. I can’t admit I’m alone, and I’m so deeply ashamed that I’d rather admit to everyone around me that I have a mom &amp; she’s just overseas than packing up my shot getting my life together and actually doing what’s right, because then I’d leave for good, and I know it’s terrible to use someone for money like that but I can’t help it. Why? Money was used to manipulate &amp; shame and proof of “love”. If I’m poor I guess I can still be small and taken care of &amp; in that world but I’m on my own and an adult &amp; need to make rent or be homeless\n\nHow do I do this? Not fuck up again?\n\nPlease help\n\n(EDIT: I guess this turned into a vent)",

My Nmom only passed the way she did by the selfish decisions of my Ngrandmother. I didn't have a very close relationship with Nmom, but even disliking her so much, I definitely didn't agree with the way she went and even fought to try to stop it. Unfortunately, Ngrandmother had power of attorney over those decisions so I could not do anything at all except watch her expire slowly.\n\n About half a year later my SO and I decided to move 21 hours away from there because now my Ngrandmother was starting to treat my two year old daughter the way she treated me and I was not going to let that happen. At that point we moved and it just dawned on me that I could just cut my Ngrandmother and my GC cousin and GC aunt out of the picture completely and never talk to them again. So I did.\n\nIt's been about two years now and I always play with the idea of writing to my Ngrandmother and telling her why I stopped all contact. I don't want contact at all. I've felt relieved and way happier than I ever was being connected with that part of my family. At the same time I don't think it would matter. My GC aunt tried to contact me through FB but blocked it. My Ngrandmother never once tried to reach out to me at all that I am aware of. So should I even really bother? Any tips or ideas that any of you have used to deal with this? ",

        "text": "I'm not really sure where to start with this. I told my parents in December 2017 that I would like them to stop contacting me, and that I would contact them when I'm ready. It didn't feel great, to be honest. I felt extremely guilty because I know that they can't comprehend the damage they caused when I was a child. Their abuse/ neglect has left me feeling broken, depressed, worthless, and with no real sense of self. I go to therapy, read books about trauma and abuse, and engage with people who are full of kindness and \"get it\" (don't abuse others, have self\\-awareness, empathetic, etc.) but it's so hard to accept that this is reality.\n\nI've been going to therapy for 6ish years total, and working on myself for even longer. It's been getting harder to maintain a grey rock type of relationship with them over the years since I moved out of their hellhole of a house. I would call/ answer their calls every few weeks but sometimes avoid it for a few months. It felt like such a chore to talk to them about my life and listen to them complain about theirs. They would send me guilt trips and ask why I don't want to talk to them, and I would just avoid the conversation for even longer. Talking to them on the phone would make me nauseous and make my entire body shake violently. I would feel a sort of ickyness for days afterward. I hated hearing about their complaints with other family members that seemed so petty and judgmental, and I hated having nothing to tell them about my own life because if I tossed them a bone and told them how I was really doing (spoiler: I was doing terrible), they would respond with something totally non\\-helpful or judge me. The progress I would make in therapy, and also the difficulties of being in therapy, weren't really something I could share with them because they think therapists judge and brainwash people. They also have no self\\-awareness or empathy, so they have nothing productive to say about the work I'm doing on myself. They'll never be proud of me for these accomplishments, and it sucks.  \n\nFor the first 5 and a half years I was in therapy, my mindset was that I needed to get over my depression and anxiety and \"succeed\" in life in order to have a normal relationship with my parents, since a common criticism growing up was that I was lazy, ungrateful, and going nowhere in life. In hindsight, I am pretty disappointed that it took me that long to realize that it wasn't my fault. That my parents were the problem. My parents treated my like a piece of property that they were stuck with and didn't want. Constant shame, humiliation, and never an ounce of empathy or affection. My therapists did not help me see this, they instead tried to tell me my thoughts were irrational and we should basically just get over it. \n\nMy current therapist, who I started seeing in August 2017, has changed my life. When I told him my story, he immediately sent me on a book reading assignment that opened up my eyes about the cycle of abuse in families. r/raisedbynarcissists and r/CPTSD have also been a great source of information and validation for my experiences. I KNOW that my parents are toxic, and I don't owe them shit, but after 6 months of having their numbers/ social media/ emails blocked I still have a lot of days where something will remind me of them and I'll think about how hurt they might be feeling. Especially my dad. They have no idea why I'm doing this, and nothing I say to them will help them understand because they can't look at themselves honestly. How do you get over the grief of realizing that you don't have a real family, and that putting yourself first and working on yourself is hurting others? I'm still working on self\\-compassion, and trying not to over\\-empathize with my parents, but goddam it's hard. \n\nCreating this boundary with my parents was a huge step for me. I did it on a leap of faith, knowing that it was best for me and my healing, but also scared and guilty for hurting my parents in the process. I keep telling myself that time will heal this wound, and it is in a lot of ways, but I still have days where it's hard to connect with the anger I feel toward them, and easier to feel empathy for them and their really sad and pathetic lives. I feel afraid that they're going to show up at my house and angrily pound on my door and yell at me. I feel afraid that if I move on with my life, something bad will happen. I can't quite put my finger on what that is, but it's just this feeling that I carry around all the time. Like they're still watching me and going to attack at any moment. \n\nI'm not really sure what I'm looking for with this post. I see a lot of people who have gone NC with their parents and seem totally 100&amp;#37; sure of their decision with a \"fuck that shit\" attitude, and I'm really envious of that. Will I get there with enough time and work? Because this feeling that the shoe is about to drop at any moment feels like it's suffocating me. ",

I just feel like no one ever really knows me and the funny thing is that I have bpd too so chances are when people are with me they are just seeing a personality cultivated for them. Everyone always thinks Im rude because I dislike most things that are considered etiquette but in order for me to explain then I'd have to tell them about the abuse and no one needs to hear that on a first encounter. Like im sorry I didn't want to hug you goodbye, I'm sorry I dont consider you my friend because we've only met a few times, I'm sorry i dont send kisses back, im sorry i dont say I love you too, im sorry I dont want to kiss you till the 4 th date. When I do these things people think up stories in their head that I was tortured or something and then they seem to be disappointed when I tell them it was emotional abuse with a little physical like 21 years of that is not enough to make me cold. My parents have to be drug lords and friends with satan to justify it. No one sticks around long enough for me to trust and I dont wanna feel like im punishing them for my past by making them wait but its bloody terrifying.

Day by day things get better and I know I'm healing even when I have lows sometimes.\n\nI blocked him from everywhere except email because we were arranging his refinancing of our place so it goes off my credit report. But even now even nearing a year he emails me every other day trying to convince me he changed, that he wants another chance, that he misses me. These types of emails \\(which by the way are always about him, no surprise\\) are also intercalated with hate mail where he says I never loved him, that I didn't try, that I used him...in all attempts to make me feel guilty, bad, pitiful. To get a reaction out of me, to get a response. Needless to say I know he hasn't changed at all. This week with the refi done I have blocked his emails too. Hard move but I've done it... \\[/context\\]\n\nI struggle with putting feelings/things that happened to me into words. A lot.

Makes me feel nothing ever happened and I'm making it or some of it up because for some reason I can't describe it, I can't put it into words, it even feels as if I have forgotten it. Like I can't describe a traumatic event in detail, the words just don't even occur to me. I end up describing things bare bones and it even doesn't sound so bad even to me. I end up thinking I AM exaggerating.\n\nSo when I've tried to explain to him how he made me feel when he verbally/sexually abused me, idk. He always has an answer for fckin everything! Or when I try to explain to him that just because he thinks something is not a big deal, it can really hurt another person, how would YOU explain that?\n\nI can only see this as me struggling with closure to be honest, which I am having trouble to accept I won't get from him, ever.\n\n... :/\n\nThanks if you've made it this far.",

I was living with an older brother at 15 already, yet I never enjoyed any independence. Everyone always expected from me to be able to make it out in one piece and by my own, and looked the other way at everything hinting the opposite was happening. The harder I failed at something, the less attention I received from friends or family.\n\nI never received help at any point of my studies, or at anything else at life, from anyone. I was never aware of this, not until my mid 20s, of how much of a handicap I was carrying by not being a capable, independent person, but someone dependant. While people praised me by my ability to make it out of unprobable scenarios, nobody was noticing or caring that I shouldn't be in such unprobable scenario in the first place.\n\nA little like praising a child for learning to properly cook at 10, there was never the thought \"but should he be cooking, at 10?\"\n\nI'm an evitative person. I think I'd make for the personality disorder. As of nowadays, things like making a phone call take me weeks or months to do, if I ever do them. But, it's not even fear, that prevents me to, but that I'm unable to make decisions. Most people have someone to ponder their decisions with, someone to talk to that has a little experience, but I was always alone at everything. I've never had security one single day of my life. I'm used to have nothing, which also doesn't help.\n\nSo, everything needs to be done from zero, and while that's good, the pace I go at isn't enough. I'm already a decade behind, if not more, and yet that distance only grows and grows. Lately, I've been trying to get my driver's license, and the only reason I've been able to make the theoric test on my own has been because everything was possible to be ordered online. Now I have to face the practical part, and I'm already two weeks in for making a phone call.\n\nI receive little to no sympathy because of having a place for my own, which all people have to work hard to earn. But I never wanted this. And most don't realise how damaging is to be living alone for more than a decade now, without a job or activites during the day. Nobody has lent a hand in this time, and so nobody will ever.",

In the end of the day, I still have something. But it turned into adversity when I was forced to be happy, be grateful, and saying a fake \"thank you\" for those things. Yes, those were gifts, from birthday gifts to a pen throughout growing up.  \n\nBut I never like any of them, however, I was forced to say \"thank you, mommy, for buying such a great pen\", be all happy about it.   That happy face was not happy at all... I wanted something different, but I've forgot how to express liking something, without feeling on edgy, or even... anxious about it.  \n\nIf this isn't suppressing a human being and taking away her natural instinct to like something, or to be herself. Then I don't know what is.  \n\nThere were people that wanted to understand what I like, and genuinely take the time to ask me.  It was sad, because they have came in a wrong time. I wasn't a kid anymore, I find difficulties in tell people what I really like, and that is sad, and also hard to admit. \n\nOne thing I realize is that, I have conflicted ideas in my head when it comes to choosing preferences of any kind. My critical voice will find.. so many faults to what I like. It was somehow confusing.  It's as if I was looking my reflection, and don't understand who I am, my identity,  what I like. \n\nThat's all I want to talk about. I wanna thank you for the people who made this place so safe for me to talk about these things. Thank you. ",

        "text": "I remember my ex would get so jealous of such simple normal things like for example:\n\nWhen I was at home one night and bored and couldn't sleep I took some selfies of me smiling in bed. He was looking through my phone months later which he insisted on doing just to keep an eye on my habits and he was like \"why are you smiling there, what were you smiling about, why were you so happy on your own, was there a man in your bed?\" I laughed at the time because it was so ridiculous, and thought maybe it was his weird sense of humour. In hindsight I think he was serious. How disturbing is that? \n\nI would talk to a guy maybe at a checkout or something, I mean friendly chit chat, being polite and friendly. When we would walk away and me thinking nothing other than where I was going he would say \" you really want his dick don't you\" It was so outrageous and just again ridiculous I would just laugh it off, but he became very annoyed by the way I communicated with men and say I come across as an easy girl with one thing on her mind and the impression I am giving out means I won't be respected or taken seriously and how I am embarrassing myself etc...( I became hyperaware of how I am potentially being perceived and being serious in public because of how stupid I am making myself look which caused tons of anxiety) He would also criticize the way I ate and say what a messy eater I am.\n\nHe would then try his best to incite jealousy in me. He would tell me stories like this girl in his class touched him today when he was giving her a lift home. I was like where? He would be like his leg or something. Then I would say well why didn't you stop her? And he would tell me to chill out and stop being so jealous.  \n\nHe also told me of this story which I believe is true, because he ended up trying his best to have sex with this older girl in his course I found out in the end. Before I knew about that he would openly say such inappropriate things like \" I was helping this girl with singing by playing guitar in her apartment we are going to be in a band together\".I felt I will trust him so thought it was innocent until he said \"she invited me into her room and she bent down infront of me and I saw her thong\" I didn't even know how to respond. I asked him why he went into her room and he had this smile that he enjoyed making me feel worried. He said to relax that it was probably a mistake, more and more things happened with this girl including her going to dinner in his alone which is what \" friends do\" he said and staying over but it was fine because \"they didnt touch in bed and didnt have sex \"  it was a mind fuck, and I wasn't allowed meet her. He said for a year while I felt I was losing it that nothing was happening and I was \"crazy\" that she thinks I am crazy too, he \" allowed \" me to meet her eventually after a year when I had to promise him I would come across as really calm and not voice any opinions or thoughts or I would look \"crazy\" most uncomfortable situation of my life, knowing all this in appropriate stuff that happened behind my back but him refusing me to open my mouth or I would look like the crazy person they all think I am. It was torture and I actually broke down afterwards and he goes see this is why you never met her \"your crazy and jealous thank god this melt down happened afterwards\".Obviously in hindsight I should have left him when all this began, it messed with my head and trust so badly. \n\nAnyway he would always big himself up then to me and say how lucky I was to have someone like him in my life who is apparently helping me, me at the time believing it and not seeing the damage he was slowly doing to my psyche. He said he was helping me be the best version if myself a more \" polished\" version. If I did well in anything he would say it was due to him or his influence on me. \n\nDoes any of this sound familiar?\n\nI feel so alone with these stories and situations I went through. \n\n\n\n",

While awareness of narcissism (the overt kind) has grown in the mainstream over the last few years, many people are still not aware of narcissistic abuse. \n\n&gt;I am a survivor of covert narcissistic abuse, which primarily took the form of emotional abuse and manipulation and control via religion and isolation. I have been on my healing journey for over a year and a half now, with the full support of my husband, my family of choice, and online support groups (Reddit played a huge part).\n\n&gt; As with many other NA abuse survivors, I have been subject to a smear campaign, gossip, public attacks, and people telling me to \"get over it\", \"forgive and forget\", and gaslighting over my decision to remove myself from a toxic situation. Those things do not concern me - the people around me everyday know who I am. \n\n&gt;I'm putting this out today in case this strikes a chord with someone on my friends list. The freedom I have felt, to finally be living as my authentic self and allowing my true personality to emerge has been exhilarating. With the FOG lifted, I am able to embrace life and actually look forward to the future with my husband and our furbabies.\n\nI have not spoken about my experience to anyone besides my husband, 2 friends and my therapist. I am an extremely private person, largely due to accusations of \"being secretive\" and having to stop writing in diaries (and writing in general) because Ndad would read them. It's extremely hard for me to trust anyone (something we all struggle with here I'm sure), so to put something so deeply personal out there without chickening out is a big step for me.\n\nHope you all have a great weekend!",

        "text": "In my post last week, I described how I was finally able to effectively dismiss a guy who was trying to manipulate me into having sex with him. Let me tell you, saying NO has changed **so much** for me since then. It's stark, almost unbelievable. I quit my job because it was causing me horrible distress, triggering my CPTSD and depression, and I realized it's ok to take care of myself by leaving. I've been setting healthy boundaries all week with people, friends and family alike. This includes telling a guy I like as a friend exactly what my physical and emotional boundaries are with him. I've been reaching out for help and connecting with friends and family instead of isolating myself to spare everyone but my dearest and saddest friends who need me most. I've been outspoken when a family member made comments that promoted thoughtless transphobia and rape culture. I've made the decision to volunteer doing something I care about. And I've made the decision to publicly out the creep. \n\n*I have stopped lying about being ok when something is wrong. I have begun to see and value my needs.*\n\nI'd like to tell you a bit about why and how this is all happening and how it relates to my N-ex. First of all, in the course of my mindfulness therapy it has come up several times that boundary-setting is a major obstacle for me. I was raised by an alcoholic mother and a very emotionally distant father and never felt particularly cared for by either throughout my childhood. Before the age of 18, there were 7 changes in who my caregivers were, due to carelessness, neglect, substance abuse, divorce, remarriage and general dysfunction. It has been extremely easy for me to look at this situation and say, \"it could have been worse - there are people who starve, there are people who are homeless, there are people with no one close to them who cares\" and so on ad infinitum. \n\nBut in point of fact, none of that matters. My experiences are my own and they have had profound effects on me. There has been a fundamental instability in my life. A parent and a child have very different approaches to boundaries. The parent is the one who sets them, period. A child is powerless and has no frame of reference for such things, no practical framework for discovering what their boundaries ought to be -- unless they are taught. I was not taught. \n\nThe closest I came to being taught about boundaries was the night my mother and I were left alone while my father and older sisters went out. I got a blister on my thumb from refilling Mom's wine glass from the boxed wine in the fridge. Later she was so inebriated she couldn't walk and had to drag herself, half crawling, across the house to the bathroom. I was terrified and thought she would die. I couldn't do anything to help her. We sat by the bathroom sink, her slumped against the cabinet in a t-shirt and panties. She told me that if anyone tries to touch me in a way I don't like, that I should kick them in the balls. She asked if I knew what balls were and I said no, so she pulled her panties aside and said, this is where the balls are on a man and that's where you kick them. I was embarrassed and confused and could only say, ok Mom, and promised her I would do as she said. I cried in terror all night, thinking she was dying, sitting with her until my siblings and dad came home. As soon as the front door opened, I ran away and sobbed into the arms of one of my sisters, leaving my mother to someone, anyone, elses's ministrations.\n\nIt turns out my mother was physically and probably sexually abused as a child by members of her own family. But I didn't know this at the time. I didn't know what rape was either. At one point later on, after my mother had committed to sobriety, she and a boyfriend put on a movie that had some really messed up scenes of rape in it, but I only sort of understood what was happening. There was a male character I thought was nice to the female main character and I said so. My mother just said, well he still raped her, so I had to ask what rape is. She only replied, you just saw it. Honestly, I don't remember exactly what the scenes were but I know for sure that no one under 17, maybe no one alive, should have been seeing that disgusting exploitation film. How could I tell her that I felt deeply disturbed and confused? It wasn't possible. How could I ask her not to show me things like that again? These boundaries would never occur to a kid of 9 years.\n\nWhat I'm coming around to saying is that these experiences of my childhood were traumatic and they sum up how it is that I have had no real tools to reject people and situations that hurt me. In fact my mother, as a parent, regretfully inflicted more pain than she helped prevent, by all of the above, followed by her suicide. And my father was incapable of discussing anything of personal importance, including grief. That's no model for a successful adulthood for me. That's nothing toward reassuring me that my needs and feelings are important. \n\n*And that is exactly how I fell into a relationship with my Nex!* I couldn't stand up for myself even though I knew he was being awful to me. I let him devalue me, gaslight me, punish me, isolate me and hurt me in so many ways, all because I was never taught my own power. I feared what would happen when I said no. The truth is that I should have feared what would happen if I kept saying yes.\n\nSo when I rejected that horny idiot via text last week, I was pissed off, I was sure of myself, and I knew what I was doing was warranted. I had recently read *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin de Becker and believed that my intuition is powerful and should not be ignored, that my safety should be valued. I had been in bed for two weeks avoiding going to work and after saying NO I was able to interpret this not as a failing but as self-preservation. And I quit my job.\n\nThere is finally room for my needs. I feel so free. Now that I know how it feels to successfully rebuff things I *know* will hurt me, I can do it again. I can do it all day! I can finally speak with conviction *and accept the consequences* because I believe my words and needs matter. I have found my voice. \n\n(And it's very verbose, yet again. Thanks for reading)",

I said \"not at this time.\" She responded, \"then I can't help you at this time.\" Fucking bitch. But I digress.

Or do I go specifically for closure of my traumas? \n\n\nA tiny bit of background: severely depressed for 25 of 29 years (probably a depressed baby but I have no distinct memories to support that). I suspect that I was sexually abused as a child and have suppressed the memories of it, because I show symptoms of it, have survived multiple instances of sexual assault as an adult, my older sister was sexually abused as a child by our nmom's ex-husband (who I have no memory of though I was old enough to have developed memory) and she one time drunkenly talked about how much she had to protect me when we were growing up but won't go into details.\n\nI'm wondering is it even worth trying to access regressed memories? Should I say screw the traumas and just go to therapy for my c-ptsd symptoms?

SDad went out and got me a new one, changed it in the freezing cold, and returned the old dead battery for the discount thing with batteries*\\).   \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I feel confident that we have helped give you the skills to be successful. \\(*hahaha..ha..ha...*\\) But there are some things you will need to learn on your own.  I know that you feel less of a need for \\(step\\)mom and I now that you don’t need us to pay for your rent or utilities. *\\(the fu..*.\\)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Nor do we feel threatened by \\(biomom\\) \\(*Can I curse? I kind of want to curse. Damn, he threw such tantrums with anything regarding my mom. That whole parent alienation? Oh yeah, he definitely tried it, but I didn't fall for it. Not sure why, but I'm glad I didn't. They would be pissed anytime we \\(siblings\\) came home from a weekend/day with my biomom, and make us clean or do chores as soon as we walked in the door. He threw away things my mom got us \\(like sweaters, toys, etc.\\) simply because they were from her\\), and he would bad mouth her anytime he could. He threatened to kick me out \\(highschool age\\) when I defended her one time*.\\)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  I do not hold any ill will toward bro and SIL. \\(*My bro stopped talking to them because he treated my SIL badly and bro demanded an apology that never came. From thence forward, Ndad and Nsmom would blame any rebellions of me or my sister on them. \"You're acting this way because SIL poisoned your mind\" I freaking have a mind of my own and you people are godawful, so maybe that's why I got mad at you or stopped talking to you?*\\)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We unconditionally love you. *\\(Guess where they got that line? From my letter because I told them their \"love\" always came with strings attached. I told them I didn't know what love was, and I didn't. I thought that people don't become friends to give, but instead to take. That love only existed when a person was useful to you. When I realized that wasn't the case...I realized I didn't know what it was and went through a phase of apathy. Now I'm married and have an amazing DH, but no thanks to them.*\\)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Love  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the Ns\n\nNow, the biggest things I wrote about in this letter are boundaries and my depression. I told them I had been cutting myself. I told them I was getting help via meds and a therapist, and that I didn't blame them for not realizing I had depression/had started to self harm. \n\nBut what pissed me off the most, is that response! First off, he never let my Nstepmom read it because the letter would hurt her feelings. So I ended up sending it to her directly and she never responded despite saying she would. \n\nSecondly, he doesn't even address the freaking depression/self\\-harm. And he also didn't really address the boundaries I had listed. \\(One of them had to do with me having a relationship with my mom and with my bro and SIL and they needed to accept that. There were four more\\). \n\nI don't know why, but...it makes me infuriated! I don't think I ever shared the exact response/letters with RBN or here \\(actually, this is my first post on LAN\\). I might've found RBN around the same time as getting his response. I don't know what I'm looking to get from posting this, but I want to get it off my chest to people that understand. \n\nTL;DR: NDad responds to letter detailing my feelings towards them, my depression and self\\-harm\\- particularly bad while living with them, and the things they screwed up as well as boundaries going forward, plus a threat that if needed, I will cut them out of my life. My NDad responded by calling me immature, not addressing any of the main things I said in the letter, and trying to sound like he loved me when he was using borrowed lines. I'm pissed he didn't respond to the depression/self\\-harm because don't parents do that?! And that later on he never tried to address it again and just rugswept the whole thing. I know it's an old exchange, but I've never gotten it off my chest before, so I wanted to share it here.",

        "text": "Okay. So. Hopefully this will be the last time I ever have to post in this sub but I did say I would update my situation with my father on here. As it turns out I can't proof read properly so when I tried to change all the names in my last post I missed some but fuck it I couldn't give a shit if anyone here finds out who I am any way or if people I know find my posts. \n\nTL;DR:  I had to cut contact with my man child father after he had a tantrum about me having a life that didn't revolve around him after 18 years. Fuck you Tony. \n\nSo after all the emails were sent and all the feelings got hurt and all things settled for a little bit, there was not much contact between me and him and I still have a lot of questions unanswered but that's okay and it's just too much effort to sift through lies. \n\nI did get the space that I needed eventually after talking to his wife. She is such a lovely woman, she can totally see where I'm coming from and where he is coming from but said to me she doesn't want to take sides as its not her place and that she wishes me the best for the future. She also said that she was so sorry about how things had gone between us and that one day we can work it out. \n\nMy “father” has since then been very passive aggressive on social media and more active than ever. He totally deleted everyone I knew except me from his social media page and made it so that the only thing I could see were pictures of us and his family, none of mine at all. \n\nHe promised me when we met again earlier this year that he would let nothing go wrong between us yet when I offered to meet him to try to fix things he declined telling me that he “does not want to meet the wrath of a 21year old girl and put her 50 year old father in his place” (I can't remember the exact thing he said but it was something like that and I really don't want to go and read the emails to find it.) \n\nHe sent me one last email after I threatened to cut contact if there were no boundaries set and if we could not follow them. They were boundaries for the both of us. His response? “I don't need boundaries, I am not your age” (again, can't quite remember what he said but it was that but worded differently) \n\nSo I cut contact, blocked him on everything I could. I have a large document full of all the emails texts and messages he sent me. I can't deal with someone trying to control me again. I did tell him only some of what my mother did to me but he still couldn't understand. It's like he didn't want to understand. \n\nHe wanted me to make me and my other half thank him and praise him for when he invited us over to dinner before Easter. He made such a big thing about it. Almost like everything we did he wanted us to over appreciate everything and he made it very dramatic. Yet where was he the last 18 years of my life?! \n\nThis year, we cut contact end of April. My birthday was early May and I have not heard a peep from him or his wife. He made me a promise he would ALWAYS be there for me and my SO and he would ALWAYS love us. And he will ALWAYS be there for my birthday. Not. \n\nHe told me so much, made me so many promises and so far he has broken everyone of them. I know that I am far better off without him and that if he ever does come knocking I will keep him at arms length. \n\nThank you to the users who gave me advise. I tried to set boundaries but he basically said no because he's an adult who shouldn't have to follow “some kid’s” rules. It's been almost a month and I'm still kinda hurt by it all. I feel so angry at him when I know I should just move on. \n\nWhen I cut off my bitch mother I went through what I am going through now. It's all the same emotions except much milder but it still hurts a little. \n\nThank you for reading, sorry it got so long. ",

        "text": "I've known for awhile now that my dad was going to die but we finally have a somewhat concrete idea of when that would be. He has liver failure. his stomach is bloated beyond belief and he regularly has to get liquid removed from his body. He can no longer support himself and he's staying in the hospital full time. Last time I saw him his limbs were so thin they were smaller then his joints. I can't stop thinking about this. \n\nIf he's left untreated for about a week the doctors say he would die (he's been refusing to take his meds for the longest time, he'd lie about whether he's taken his meds or not in front of the nurses)\n\nI'm pretty unreasonably worried about others being judgmental about my situation but there's a lot going on more then that and I'm completely depleted.\n\nI've accepted the fact i'm never going to get any apology from him. I'm more worried about healing from the damage he's caused. I'm anticipating a huge crash.  If anyone can relate to this; I would like some insight. Thank you. \n\n______\n\nEdit: I just wanted to update this thread. \n\nI went to see the doctors a few days ago and discovered his condition has rapidly decreased. Instead of months he only has a few weeks left; how many is undetermined. I wasn't clear that he has cirrhosis as well as hepatitis B in my original post. Its in it's fatal stages. My dad's liver has stopped working completely and because of scarring no toxins can be cleared. My sister currently has power of attorney. Me and my family are trying to send him to a hospice so that he can spend the last few days peacefully. \n\nI'm visiting him everyday right now. I only hope that he passes away sleeping because it's the only time he's not delirious with pain. My dad has permanently damaged me in many ways but right now; I take back all the times I wished pain upon him. No one deserves experiencing so much pain they become unable to make decisions for themselves.\n\nI know this is a lot I want to connect an reply to everyone individually. I hope to get back to you soon and thankyou for reading my post. \n\n\n\n",

My brother still accuses my parents of being traitors and tries not to talk to them. Okay there was a (to me) somewhat funny (I had adrenaline pumping) situation where he was screaming: I DO NOT EVER WISH TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN. My parents said nothing and he left. About 45 seconds later he came back to make sure that they understand that he doesn't want to talk to them anymore (which is the ironic part).\n\nI also showed my mother the documentary by Richard Grannon. She tried sugarcoating the behaviour of her first born son afterwards. \n\nSo today I was mowing the lawn. When I was done I entered the kitchen to get something to drink. While I was doing so, my brother entered the kitchen aswell and started eating out of a pan with his fingers like he always does. Shortly after, he left and I followed the same direction, but then he suddenly turned towards the kitchen (3&gt; meters away from me) and I was forced (nowhere to move) to have physical contact with him. Like he always does that: Meeting him on the stairs he would always shove me, but the stairs are no problem anymore. But he still continues to follow me into the kitchen, going over the leftovers and eating with his very own hands instead of using the instruments that my mother and I clean for usage. I am certain he does that on purpose as a way to establish some form of control or whatever.\n\nShould I scream at him to leave me alone? How can I get him to accept my wish to not have him in my vicinity at any given time?\n\nThere is no way of talking to him in a reasonable voice, but I probably don't need to mention that here. Please don't tell me to get an apartment, that's not helpful at all.\n\nThanks in advance",

But in spite of this i was doing a really good job of holding it together and not getting freaked out about wedding planning.\n\nAll was going well until I told my siblings, one of whom gets it, and the other one is still totally enmeshed. Maybe it would have been wiser not to invite her - but recently we’ve been getting on better and she’d been much more respectful of my NC decision.\n\nBut no, the flying monkey came out in force - I got a manipulative, emotional blackmail text from this sibling, telling me to reconsider inviting NMom to the wedding. I explained why I’m not going to do that, and she’s been radio silence for the past 3 days.\n\nI’m feeling petrified that somehow she’s going to tell NMom about the wedding, and the N will show up uninvited. Or somehow she’ll manage to ruin the wedding in some way. \n\nShe convinced me I was disgusting and unlovable. There’s a big part of me that’s now really scared that NMom will somehow reveal to SO and my friends and SOs family that I really am disgusting and unlovable, and then he’ll call the wedding off and my friends will reject me.\n\nI know that’s not logical - but I’m totally freaking out now.\n\nI’ve been doing really well, I had my PTSD under control and been feeling really good for about a year. But ive totally crumbled now and my PTSD has gone into overdrive.\n\nI can’t face work tomorrow. I can’t make any decisions. I want to curl up in a ball and hide in a cupboard.\n\nThere’s a part of me that wants to just get married ASAP without inviting anyone, before NMom has a chance to try to ruin my life again. \n\nHas anyone else been through this kind of thing with a wedding or some other kind of big celebration? Any tips or advice for getting through the wedding planning and dealing with flying monkeys? \n\nThnx \n\n",

I got into a specific university department that I'd been gunning for, for over a year. I was celebrating. But when I see blonde hair now on my sheets or my shirt or on my hairbrush, I have a moment of absolute panic. I guess I forgot my abuser. Whether that's good or bad, I don't know. But she too is blonde. And seeing what I think is her hair is sometimes still too much for me. \n\nIt's stuff like that- that always comes up the moment when I think I'm finally over it. \n\nHow do you recover from childhood abuse? The answer that I've found is that you don't. You heal a little, but there's still always a scar. It gets lightyears easier to be a normal human as you reintegrate yourself back into society.

My first instinct afterwords was to pull forward a few inches before somebody could come out and see it, which i did - the same time mom came out to see what happened. She immediately asked if i hit it and i just took a deep breath and said yes.\n\nIf this had happened a few years ago i would have blown up about how my brother should have pulled into the driveway correctly and if he hadnt been parked there i wouldnt have hit him and its all his fault. If it had happened just a few weeks ago i probably would have broke down crying, completely given up on going wherever i was going and would have hid in my room the rest of the day asking *why me*.\n\nIf it had been my dad who had come out of the house instead of mom (he hasnt lived with us for six years so no worries) he would have blown up with \"what were you thinking?! Why werent you paying attention?! Youve been driving for years! How could you be so reckless! Now im the one thats gonna have to fix this mess!\" (Even though as i just said, there is no mess).\n\nBut mom just said something like \"im glad you didnt break the brake lights. The small dent that i do see can probably just be polished out.\" She probably wont have it polished out. There a few other minor scratches on her otherwise nice car (which i was driving) and just isnt bothered by it enough to put money out on fixing something thats purely aesthetic.\n\nMy brother gave me a hard time about how his jeep is \"literally undriveable\" despite no visible marks whatsoever. That's okay, exaggerating things i think is his way of saying \"your reaction to this is way bigger than necessary.\" (Im an autist and have a hard time reading him sometimes, so he tends to exaggerate things way more than normally necessary to make sure i get the joke)\n\nI ended up crying for a few minutes on the way to my destination and just now typing this down, but otherwise i think im already over it.\n\nIts so nice not having to put my entire life on pause to to handle a meltdown from such a small thing.",

        "text": "I am about to disappear and start a new life at age 26. I have three-thousand dollars in savings, and a 1996 Camry with low miles that I've been working on. It's in excellent shape. I have an Airbnb already paid for, for my first two months in Washington. At the end of June, I am getting in my car and driving away.     \n\nI was raised Mormon in Utah, a stones throw from the Provo temple and BYU. I am a lesbian. Ending up gay in Provo, Utah was not ideal. My father is a diagnosed Narcissist (though he rejects the diagnosis) and many of my (14!) siblings have Cluster B disorders. My step-dad is awful emotionally abusive, with a dash of physical abuse every once in a while, and is about as mature as a 13 year old and incredibly manipulative. He's ruined many parts of my relationship with my mother (who's main flaw is her choice in men). My mother is my only family that I have a pretty good/close relationship with.     \n\nFrom age 2yo until 16yo or so, I was sexually abused by multiple family members (men and women, they don't know about each other doing it for the most part). I've been held against the wall and been spit in the face and screamed at, too. I have generalized anxiety, PTSD, and since age 23-ish social anxiety. I have several auto-immune related issues that seem to be caused by stress (unknown cure syndrome BS) on top of it.         \n\nI thought I had escaped once. I lived with a life partner for the 3 years before same-sex marriage was legalized. The week we broke up, gay marriage was legalized. Hurt like hell. I'm guessing she cheated on me... but I had to move back home. That was a mistake.         \n\nAt the end of June, I am driving to Washington and never coming back if I can help it. I can do my degree from anywhere (online). I should've done this years ago. I should've done this the second my ex left me. I should've got a job and moved out but I decided to \"sacrifice\" my mental/physical health to stay at home and study computer science full time. Bad decision. I'm trying not to beat myself up about it and get the Hell out of Dodge. I just hope it goes well for me. I really need it. I just want peace. I don't want much, just peace. I don't want to be scared to go upstairs to the kitchen and not know what my step-dad is gonna do today. I don't wanna feel like a black sheep for being non-mormon lesbian. ...    \n\nI'm scared leaving won't change anything and that I won't be able to let go or move on. I'm scared I won't get a job and will have to come \"crawling back to live in the basement.\" (as one parent put it). ... I'm scared of any outcome but I know I have to at least try to leave. I'm an adult. I can do it. I just need advice on how to move on once I get out there. I want to emotionally let go, but it's so hard to let go of these painful memories that surface all the time. The pain runs so deep in my heart... :( Do you have any advice or encouragement at all? I could really use some right now.        \n\n** TL;DR I'm running away from Narcissistic father-figures and mormon family at the end of June. I'm 26 but I feel like I don't know anything. How can I let go of the pain and just move on in my new life? Any advice? Any encouraging stories (\"it gets better\")? **    \n\nEDIT: typo and also this my first post in this sub. ",

        "text": "so I've been offline for a very long time to do some car accidents and actually I've gotten back in touch with some good cousins and friends.\n\n\nI've even met a fellow acon ...he's from another country so it's a bit long distance at the moment... but it's been quite positive even dare I say the healthiest relationship of my entire life so far. We support and trust and speak openly without shouting and resolve rationally and it actually works... weird! Splendidly weird.\n\nBoth brothers have gone LC or NC in the time I was away so it's even safe to speak with one of them now. Again it's been very much a conscious effort to break pattern but again, it actually works. Fight Club is long since physically over (probably in my RBN posts some years back) and although we disagreed on the N's antics and our LC/NC pacing, we all refer to the Ns as \"the biologicals\" now.\n\n\nSo I just wanted to say that yeah that took the entire time growing up knowing things were wrong to finding RBN to going NC about 5 years ago almost, and finally I have some functional and supportive relationships...and it's really weird\n\n\nBut weird in a good way ... because we all come from such damaged backgrounds and we've all spent varying amounts of time trying to deal with the N-uclear Family Fallout, but everybody's trying very hard to be a functional adults and have positive relationships, learning from friends and positive role models what to do/not to do ... and from watching the massive failures of the Ns and the Coabusers (Es) and the FMs, especially as they definitely lose control as they get older my goodness there's been antics... and now everyone's gotten quite good at flea-spotting politely, civilized disagreements, and supportive gestures... which is actually very nice even though we are still in the verdi earliest stages of trying to relate to one another in a normal way and we range from 25 so 41, we're all managing to be actual functional adults! :o\n\n now we just think it sad so few of us have escaped... but it looks like my boyfriend's brother may also have made his own kind of escape just without knowing the words and steps, so maybe our range will increase to age 55ish soon since they've gotten back in touch, so we may have one more escapee on \"team putting the fun in functional\" than we thought \n\nit's weird that life can actually be good and not a constant state of adrenaline or drama or violence. So yeah it finally seems to be working out all right.\n\n Thanks to everyone over at rbn and over here at Lan, I'll still drop in from time to time to be a knight of new, but  mainly I mainly I wanted to encourage the newer people to keep going... unfortunately all of us have lost a few friends or cherish relatives or relationships over this process but although it's distressing it's not so much a breakup or an ending as simply outgrowing those people and hoping they catch up now. I think it's called compersion in Psychology maybe one of the therapists folks here can correct me on that\n\n\n As for us,  actually does work... with some good therapists and a little of the Pete Walker books and some EMDR and paying very careful attention to transactional analysis during imteractions and some very difficult practise making boundaries and having those boundaries respected ( interesting Lee once we got to the topic of making boundaries, all the other people on team functional immediately understood and respected, and that's how we figure out which of our friends were going along with us and which we would have to leave behind until they learned better or growing a little more and hopefully they can come back but we don't go chasing after they're trying to help them or to rescue them anymore, we just let it go sometimes with a lot of sadness but we know it's the right thing we don't doubt that anymore) \n\n\nand actually having some good experiences, which really does reinforce the good patterns and it's really hard and really scary but now we're starting to see the results it's really worth it \n\n\nSo for all the people still stuck in it, it does get better \n\n\nI'm completely NC, I know many of you have chosen otherwise and I respect that too, but I hope your Journeys will be brief and easy or at least as brief and easy as possible thanks to the support from these subreddits and the resources. \n\nThanks especially to the mods /u/wordtoyourmother8 and /u/SeaTurtlesCanFly  for sending cards all those use ago when we did the first Christmas card exchange or holiday card and that was the first holiday that I'd escapes, that meant an awful lot. And to all the mud teams you kept the stalkers in the mindspoisoners and the Wormtongues out of the threads, you guys doing awesome job. \n\nHave a good weekend and keep up the fight, I didn't think it would get better but it's gotten better than I ever thought possible although it's still hard to see some time and all of this on team functional still have a lot of shame issues especially when we have to explain to a new service or like my cousin's boss why she needs a day to go to court to get rid of her parents, it's interesting how everyone reverse too but they're your parents or if we're helping people to whom were not related they automatically assume we're family... So I guess we're finally at least giving the world the impression that were normal even if it's family by choice and not biology, those comments don't stink so much we actually find them funny now \n\n\nanyway all the best from tartan\n\n\nPS sorry yes I am still using the broken talk text but another thing we do on team functional is if one person finds a local resource for something we all share it and keep a list so that as our needs change or as more people join team functional we know the social workers who get it and the police officers who get it and the judges who understands and the other service providers or doctors who won't make silly comments or minimize what we've gone through. It's been a lot better in the family of choice groups and trying to do it by myself your mileage may vary. But yes the phone will be fixed shortly and yes I did finally find housing and yes the stalkers did eventually wind up in jail because hands dig their own holes you just have to let them, and so yeah it looks like it might be a decent summer after all. Hope yours is too",

        "text": "What comes to mind today, in particular, is the fact that we had a piano in our house. Often he would almost command me to play as if he was Mozart’s dad and expected me to pull out a flawless sonata. Sometimes, unpredictably, he’d blow up at me for playing “too loudly” or too sloppily. My friends would want to play our piano, too, and whenever my dad walked into the room he’d give us a face and I’d do the policing for him, i.e. “Okay, guys, maybe try a different song” or “Let’s play something simple or gentle now.” One of my best friends in middle/high schools told me that even the amount of fun I was allowed to experience was restricted. I acknowledged that my dad was strict, but I didn’t realize that these examples played into all the other ones which reflected abuse.\n\nAnother thing just popped into my head: ndad used to bark orders at e/n-mom, gc sister, and (sg) me re: cleaning the house. He would “manage” or “supervise” the cleaning as if we were a little collective of Cinderellas. I will never forget cleaning the stove and having him look over my shoulder before he walked out of the kitchen; when I had finished cleaning, he would stick his head into my room and tell me in a stern tone that I had missed a spot and left a few grease stains on the stove (sometimes it’s hard to clean stoves even with the right cleaner, especially if they’re old).\n\nHe would threateningly come into my room and look around with an expression/gesture that would say “This isn’t clean enough, so why aren’t you doing something about it?” I was never allowed to put posters up in my room the way I wanted to, either, because it “didn’t look clean.” I should mention ndad has a textbook case of OCD, too.\n\nAll of these seemingly LITTLE moments, piled on top of one another for over two decades of my life, have resulted in a never-ending stream of rage that poisons my heart and mind. The anger never stops. I don’t know who I actually am or what I actually like. I spent years defending and making jokes about my ndad because I had nowhere else to go, because I literally couldn’t do anything about my situation. I was just a kid and it wasn’t my fault, but JESUS CHRIST I wasted so much time making excuses for this monster and the rest of my family/etc. who enabled him. I’m almost 30 and I’m a shell of a human being. My friends were completely right to feel uncomfortable.\n\nI swam competitively for almost 10 years because my ndad pushed me into that, too (he was never an athlete and wanted to feel athletic I guess). I thought I swam because *I* wanted to. He never even showed up to most of my meets. He didn’t give a shit about whether or not I was healthy. He just wanted to know the “results,” AKA my times and where I placed in races. I started swimming again recently but realized I really resent the fact that it makes me feel better because it was never something I voluntarily wanted. \n\nSame thing with report cards, by the way: zero shits given about INTERESTS and LEARNING. He just wanted to know the letters on the piece of paper so he could brag about it to whoever. Because that’s really what matters, isn’t it?\n\nWhen I look in the mirror, I’m filled with bitterness. I don’t know who I see, but I know I see tons of anger. The only things that have defined me are my nfamily and my anger. WHEN WILL I GET A TURN? ",

My ndad would always say im not got enough and blame me for things i did that im pretty sure are normal child behaviors. Well, its kind of hard to please an nparent when they never explain or show by example the correct way of doing something and find a way to invalidate a job well done no matter how perfect it is. Thanks a lot dad for all of your wonderful parenting and valuable life lessons. /s\n\nI think ive associated even the smallest degree of admitting fault with Something Bad. Im not even sure what that Bad Thing is, just that even when i realize ive done something wrong, my first instinct is to do something more wrong to cover it up instead of accepting whatever consequence will Definitely Absolutely Be Way Worse Than... im not even sure. At that point i usually realize this is stupid, but still i struggle with correcting the mistake while still wanting to hide it from as many people as possible.\n\nSo that brings me to today. I work with a handicapped mom to help her get her disabled kids ready for school in the morning. There was a misunderstanding between us this morning that i believe was my fault. After i realized this and got clarification on everything and fixed everything i had done wrong because of the misunderstanding, she apologized to *me* for not being clearer. And at that point i was like \"no wait this is my fault. I assumed you meant this when i wasnt sure and i should have asked for you to clarify at the beginning instead of having this huge mess.\" But she was still like \"thats okay, it got fixed anyway and i should have realized i needed to be clearer before you had to do any of that.\"\n\nThis was really refreshing for some reason? Like her goal was to fix the problem and assigning blame had nothing to do with that goal? And then that unconscious realization that there was no blame to be had made it easier for me to accept responsibility for it?\n\nIs this how problems are solved by healthy people? Because if it is then everybody should be a healthy person because this is a whole lot easier. Def recommend 10/10 would do it again.",

Many memories have resurfaced, and most don't seem as innocent or neutral as they used to. \nShe's diagnosed me with dissociative disorder, body dysmorphia, C PTSD, and (used to have) Stockholm syndrome, which I suspect most of us have (had). \n\nNo matter how many memories I seem to find, or be told that the things they did were abusive/strange/mean, I don't *feel* like it was abusive. In my head I still wonder whether I remember it correctly, if it's a misunderstanding, maybe they didn't mean it this way... a part if me still wonders if it's not normal parenting, or if I didn't have it coming. \n\nAt times I do well, and I am fierce in my belief that they were abusive, and other times I struggle to see it as anything else but the intense dislike of my parent leading me to go NC. I'd never go back, but I wish I felt more secure about the reasons why I left. I know I couldn't handle it anymore, but somehow I fail to see the abuse in it. I want to think they're abusive because it makes me feel justified about my feelings all these years and for leaving, but I am also very careful not to pick and choose things to fit what I want to hear (which makes me question things for myself).  \n\nI've told my psychologist this, and I think she said I wasn't there yet, but I would be at some point. And that they were abusive, though she thinks it was more due to stupidity than malice (her example: one mom puts her baby in the fire because she knows a baby needs to stay warm and it burns to death, another wants to hurt the child and throws it in: both babies die, but the intention was different). But that in the end, I wouldn't have ended up with chronic shame, self-loathing, hyper vigilance, dissociation, body dysmorphia, anxiety and depression problems and other issues that I seem to have, if I had a normal upbringing.\n\n\nIt just seems no matter how much my SO tells me, or my psychologist, I find it hard to believe, and I focus on the things that make them more \"human\". I really just wish I could/would accept and see it for what it is, and I don't know why I can't. \n\n\nI'd really like to hear you guys' feedback on this, thank you. ",

        "text": "A while ago I posted on r/raisedbynarcissists about how I felt I could not even begin the healing process because, being only 19 years old, I saw no way of cutting off contact with my narcissistic parents without setting myself up for homelessness. 2 months later, that has turned out to be completely false.\n\nI was able to land 2 different jobs for the summer \\(and possibly next school year, if all goes well\\) and sublease an apartment. I currently work 35 hours a week and make more than enough to pay my bills and stash some on the side because, being in the tech industry, I'm well\\-paid despite being entry\\-level/hourly. \n\nFor the next school year and in the foreseeable future 100&amp;#37; of my school and living expenses will be covered by scholarships or grants as long as I maintain a 3.0 GPA, which means that I can keep myself from having to ask my parents to cosign any loans or help me out with bills.\n\nAlthough they've recently been bugging me about wanting to come visit me where I live \\(\\~2 hours away\\) and I may have to stay with them for 2 weeks while I wait for my next lease to start, I can say with confidence that low\\-contact is working surprisingly well and I feel like it's not unrealistic to suppose that I could cut them off after graduation without great difficulty.\n\nI hope this won't fall under the \"no uplifting posts\" rule. I guess I just wanted to share my success with people to whom it might mean something more. Even though my friends are happy for me and everything I don't really think they understand what an immense relief this is for someone who was basically prevented from attaining any level of independence or maturity within my parents' household.\n\n I think this may demonstrate that the actual physical or financial hold that a narcissist has over their children is on a deadline and all the obsessive control and emotional manipulation they perpetrate is an attempt to push back that deadline indefinitely. And I think realizing that has really given me the strength to keep going.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. This paragraph will serve as the tl;dr but keep reading if you want to hear more of my story. Today I really need to celebrate a seemingly small, but hard-won victory. I deflected the advances of a guy who I knew didn't treat me with respect. It sounds so easy but most of us here know exactly how difficult it can be. Not only did I deflect him but I dissected his behavior, in the most freeing and honest text message I have ever composed. I am proud that I had the guts to say what I was thinking, shut down the guy's BS, and protect myself.  [Behold!](https://s9.postimg.cc/p2kcl2mpb/Screenshot_2018-05-22-08-10-36.png)\n\nWomen reject men every day so let me tell you why I feel this to be so significant. I was trapped in a relationship with my Nex for 3 years, followed by a period of hoovering that ended when I changed my phone number mid-conversation. That was another proud moment for me. :) In my opinion, the root of that situation lay in my own behavior - my inability to stand up for myself, self-advocate effectively, be proactive, and basically say no. This does not mean I blame myself for what happened, clearly the narcissist was the abuser and he is the one who directly harmed me. He is the one who chose to target me, seeing me as vulnerable right away, in a state of depression and grief. I was literally crying when we met and then for three years and more it seemed I would never stop. [Edit: More likely, he saw energy in me that he could try to slowly siphon away. People who cry in public are people who care about things and that's all simply narcissistic supply for him.]\n\nI saw his horrible nature on our first date. He made an awful racist joke ~~with no awareness of~~ with great enjoyment of how crass and vile he appeared to me. I attempted to end the date, we argued in the car driving away, I found him revolting and idiotic. And yet somehow there was a second date! *I lacked the skill of accepting the consequences for saying no.* Being with my Nex only exacerbated this, of course, damaging my self confidence to a point I thought for a time was beyond repair.\n\nNot saying no has led to innumerable preventable painful experiences for me. Not listening to my inner voice and intuition has hurt me again and again. But I think I may finally be learning. \n\nI will probably stick my foot in my mouth from time to time or be wrong about something or hurt someone else's feelings. But dammit, *my* feelings are important. I don't *need* to be right every time if I am putting my safety and my well-being first. I am worth protecting and I *will* say NO.\n\nI don't post much but I read in here once in a while and whenever I do I find some healing. Maybe this will help someone else.\n\nEdit 2: The strikethrough correction.",

        "text": "Hi all. Just a warning that this may be a bit long!\n\nShort intro about me: I'm a 30 yr old female ACoN with an nmom, enabler dad and possibly an nsister with borderline tendencies that is the Golden Child now. I currently see a trauma therapist, have a few friends and boyfriend to confide in, but don't understand the situation all that well and I live on my own. I have a steady full-time job and have been rigorously working on healing. I have improved a lot but it still takes me a long time to recover after a flashback/contact with nmom/triggers. I'm trying to learn and practice self-soothing techniques and self-validation since I have very little support.\n\nMy sister's wedding is in September of this year. We have not seen each other in over a year since I left my parents house. I've been on Very Low Contact with my mom and dad as well as my extended family, for whom all I know could be Flying Monkeys. However, it seems my parents are paying for part of the wedding since they kept haranguing me about being a bridesmaid. I kept telling them, \"No, I will not be a bridesmaid; I'll attend the wedding as a guest.\" It seemed like they ignored each and every one of my declinations since my sister ordered me a bridesmaid dress anyway (with no measurements or anything). \n\nSince October 2017 through April 2018, my sister and I have been emailing each other back and forth intermittently about her wedding. The emails I've sent to her have had a firm but friendly-ish &amp; open-minded tone. An example below:\n\n*'Congratulations on your engagement! Dad called me last week asking me (I'm assuming, on your behalf) if I would want to be a bridesmaid for your upcoming wedding next year.\n\nI'm reaching out to you personally because I want to make sure that we are on the same page regarding your wedding, and I don't want there to be any misunderstandings between us. The last thing I want would be to offend you surrounding such an important event.\n\nThat being said: Do you actually want me to be a part of your wedding...would it make you happy? If yes, I'd love to have a chance to mend the rift I've caused between us and be a part of your bridal party. Please let me know what your thoughts are.'*\n\nAll of the emails I've received back from her have been cold, business-like; example: \n\n*\"You were asked if you wanted to be a part of this wedding; therefore, this decision is entirely yours. If you want to partake in this because you actually want to join this celebration, go ahead. If you are solely doing this out of some sense of obligation, I do not recommend you attend.\"*\n\nThey've all seemed like they're only being sent on the account of our mom, who wants the both of us to repair our relationship \"just because we're sisters.\" Knowing how my sister really is after growing up with her 20+ years, I definitely get the sense that she hates my guts for moving out, cutting off contact with her and definitely doesn't want me to be a bridesmaid or even attend the wedding at all. \n\nThe last email exchange we had, I brought up questions that I truly wanted answers to and in her response, she ignored and didn't answer all of them. All that she said was, *\"You are my sister. Whatever you decide, I’ll respect.\"*\n\nI seriously do not have any idea on what to do. My boyfriend told me the other night that he won't be coming with me to the wedding because my sister immediately judged him when they first met and had very negative things to say about him. I admit that while I'm extremely disappointed about that, I get it. If I have to face my entire family, alone, my instinctual answer is: \"I changed my mind, I'm not going to the wedding after all.\"\n\nCan anyone shed any light on my situation and let me know what it sounds like from an outside perspective? Or even if anyone can tell me what they would do in this situation? I would just GREATLY appreciate any and all ideas. \n\nEdit: formatting &amp; spelling",

I was only successful once and she took me right home.\n\n\nSo when I recall my memories of growing up, and memories of her, I can't think of a single one that is positive.

They need me to be crazy so that they do not have to monitor their own behavior. That is the function of them telling me that I was and am crazy. \n\nThey seemed to enjoy setting up therapy for me, trying to get me on medication multiple times: it was like raising a campaign to get me on psychiatric medicine. \n\nThey once got me to attend a family therapy session where my narc mother and golden child sister ganged up on me, and the therapist, who was only a social worker and not a psychotherapist sat there and did nothing, and just let them rip into me for the full session while I cried. That was 22 years ago. And I kept giving them so many chances. But now when I think about the lack of respect and dignity they showed me, the only craziness I had was letting them back in my life time and time again. \n\nThis last and final time I went NC, my family members reached out to my husband, trying to “check up” on my mental health with him, they even went so far as to diagnose me as mentally ill, and told my husband they hope I can find an experienced therapist to help me deal with my “borderline personality disorder.” \n\nTo believe in yourself and love yourself, you must not let crazy people who would rather stick you in a mental institution than examine their own motives and behavior have any influence over you. \n\nFor too long I bought it, I felt crazy because they gaslighted me. They wore down my self esteem until I had no more inner monologue and felt like a ghost, drifting through life trying to succeed at making them happy with me, which you never, ever can. They enjoyed keeping me in a role which made them feel better about themselves. And even my littlest siblings did it too, because that’s all they ever knew. \n\nI got tired of being judged by those who have no right to judge me. \n\nThe amazing thing about going NC is that I am actually starting to think about what I want to do, and am making moves to change my life for the better. \n\nAs much as I still love my family I think it has been necessary for me to break entirely away. Sometimes that is just our path in this life. We grow up with people that show us how NOT to be. \n\nLove to all who are struggling today. It gets easier. The more intimacy and friendship and love you have with yourself, the more you begin to heal. \n\n\nTLDR: if you are wondering if I AM crazy, you see how easy it is for me to tell people about why I had to leave my family. First taboo, “You don’t see your family?!?” Second taboo, “Well have you ever CONSIDERED that you may be crazy? I mean, maybe your family is right.” ",

It came to light a few years ago that they were very serious about \"retiring\" and moving in with husband and I.  I was \\(naively and before realizing what the problems were\\) amenable to this until we went through a round of looking at houses with them.  It quickly came out that rather than \"all I want is to be near you!\" turned into \"all I want is this huge house with a nice in\\-law suite, a big yard, a great neighborhood, and all these things you can't even afford right now but you should provide me with.\"  Additionally, by \"retiring\" they mean doing absolutely nothing but living with and siphoning off us \\(their definition of \"being\" with us\\).  nDad has repeatedly asked me for an allowance, which I've said \"maybe\" and then never brought up again.  He keeps telling me that they're just not making enough on their own to keep living where they're at \\(but they've been \"not able\" to afford it for almost 4 years now...  right\\).\n\nWe ended up moving a few states away.  nDad has repeatedly said he is going to fix up their house and move them to be nearby, but of course there's a bunch of reasons why he can't fix the house and none of them are his fault.  \\(The painter won't call back, no one wants the job, oh my gosh how did he accumulate all this shit, why did I leave all my shit in their house, he can't do anything because I won't tell him if I want the shit I left behind and haven't ever inquired after, etc\\).  It's essentially the \"come do this for me, I can't manage to do it myself, HALP\" tactic.  We usually see them about once a year, when he will try to pull me off to one side and get me to promise to take care of nMom if anything should happen to him.  \\(Lately he's taken to telling me how his boss has adopted them and loves them like her parents.  Good for her.\\)\n\nSo essentially what I'm saying is that I don't know what to do with them, outside of just leaving them where they're at.  I don't necessarily feel obligated to care for them \\- they're adults and I won't sacrifice the wellbeing of my own family to fulfill their fantasies.  I'm telling myself that I may just have to leave them there and be completely hands\\-off.  And maybe that's the only answer that will work, because it's damned if you help and damned if you don't, but I would like to try and minimize the hassle and problems I will have to deal with later on.  As an only child, I don't have a golden child sibling they can cling to and leave me the hell alone.  I'm also not sure if it will be less hassle now to move them \\(they would still be at least an hour away and they don't know my actual address\\) rather than waiting until one of them dies and potentially having to deal with that shitstorm.  I don't want them closer, but am trying to determine what path may be less hassle or may be the best course of action.  Has anyone had something similar with aging nRents attempting to get you to float/take care of them?  Any suggestions are welcome.",

        "text": "People always refer to how an NPD parent really is on the recieving end of karma as they age. This does make sense, in terms of their false self and false reality moving further and further from the actuality of events. That cannot be in any way comfortable to deal with. \n\nBut people also refer to how they end up alone. Okay some people might comment that a Narc is always alone - has no real friends etc. So arguably old age for them is just a recycling over and over - just like it always was. \n\nBut I wonder, if there is a covert NM, and and overt ND - both of whom are very toxic, as is the case in my family - well they won't leave each other. So will happen with them? They have potentially another 20+ years left on planet earth. \n\nI just find it unclear, if an individual Narc really starts reap the nastiness of what they have sown over the years - how does it affect the dynamic between the two of them? It seems they still provide support for each other, in whatever twisted way they do. \n\nI guess the root of the reason I am questioning this is in seeking justice for the scapegoat. The Narcs have conditioned the Scapegoat to be unsure, frightened, anxious, all of these things - just to make them look strong. Additionally, they have put down the scapegoat to other family and friends to again make themselves look strong. And as a couple they can boulster the fable even more. I would simply like to see justice for the scapegoat. Maybe I am partially in victim-mode trying to seek justice in this fashion. I should just move on and aim at making my life a success. Yet I have been very unfairly treated throughout my life, and I honestly do hope these so called parents pay for how they have made it their pathetic business to hurt me. ",

I want to be closer to him and I think he wants the same, but I want nothing to do with his wife/my mom.\n\nBut I don't think he knows how to have a relationship that doesn't involve her. I don't think he has his own agency, I don't think he can make his own decisions.\n\nWe're long distance, and I'm not even sure how to aknowledge to him that I want nothing to do with his wife. I mean, I think he's read between the lines. He gave me advice on wording, for *if* I texted my mom on mother's day. But it's still.... If I say something about it, it gives him a chance to try and convince me to give my mom another chance. It also means he has to aknowledge he's in a position of drama. If we ignore it, no one has to talk about it and I don't get anyone more upset.\n\nIt just hurts because he was my favorite parent growing up and I don't know that I'll ever see him again, and I don't know if the parent I remember even ever existed. We had good road trips without my mom. Those are about it, and that's not happening again. He can't even go to a museum without her, he's so enmeshed and it hurts.\n\nI'm crying in a bathroom stall at work and everything is just so sad. I'm talking to my therapist on Monday about going back on venlafaxine/Effexor. I was on it a few years ago and it was great. I just don't want to try to handle all this anxiety and sadness without chemical supports. I've been a anxious mess for the last month and I don't see my anxiety or depression or whatever going away anytime soon. I've also been ignoring my suicidal ideation, but it's really annoying. It's like a [Clippy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant) pop-up that says \"I see you're sad. Want to think about killing yourself?\" and I keep clicking \"fuck off\", but instead of going away it says \"sure! I'll remind you again in 28 hours.\" because it was programmed by Microsoft. It's nowhere near as bad as the first time I was on venlafaxine, but it's not normal. But I'm ok and don't worry, **I'm not a suicide risk.** \n\nOh, and now I remember it's right before my period.

He is 34, has no friends, no job for years. He won't leave, he is inducing guilt and waiting for a good time for the cycle to repeat once again. He hasn't hugged them for several years and his illness got a lot worse in the last three years (he physically attacked my mother - standing in her way, she tried to get by, he pushed her and blamed her afterwards (happened to me several times). He also threatened to use physical force against her multiple times ; she was the only one not to be attacked physically until then. Currently I am on the look out to rent a house with two of my friends so I can terminate the last bit of contact I got to have (26, fucked up my studies and my apartment cause I went into a big depression). My parents are suckers for love and they still believe there is hope. I mean they just understood that he is seriously ill during this year. Looking at DSM-5 I am certain about 8/9 traits being present in him.\nI also underwent therapy for a short time and it really helped me but she was too esoteric so I left and right now I do not have the money for it.\n\nSo what now, will I be struck by a desperation attack or do I not have to worry?
