The only things you know is that the light bulb is currently off and that one switch will turn on the light bulb while the other two do nothing. You can flip any number of switches as many times as you would like before you go to check the light bulb. How can you guarantee that you will know which of the three switches controlled the light bulb the first time you go to check if the light bulb is on?\n\n\n-There is no way to see if the light bulb is on from your room. The light bulb room is completely light-proof.\n\n-The answer must work every time, no matter which switch would work. You cannot leave it up to chance.\n",

This means that instead of having paid $10 each, each of them had paid $9 (Due to the refund). $9 times 3 is $27.

The game consists of several players trying to eliminate the others by means of squirting them with water pistols in order to be the last survivor. Once hit, the player is out of the game. Game play is fair play at all times and all locations, and tends to last several days depending on the number of participants and their stealth. At Troyhill University, 5 students participated in a game that only lasted four days. Can you determine each player's first name, their color, their assassin alias, how they were eliminated, and their major?\n\nNames: Liam, Anabel, Bella, Oliver, Ethan\nColors: Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Black\nAlias: Captain Dawn, Night Stalker, Dark Elf, McStealth, Billy\nCapture: Caught at weekly study group, Caught helping friend with car trouble, Ambushed during sleep, Caught on the way to class, Winner\nMajor: Economics, Biology, Art History, Sociology, Psychology\n\nMONDAY: Liam, the girl named Captain Dawn, and the person in purple avoided any action that day. The psychology major was able to easily catch Ethan because she already had a study group meeting with him that day. Since it was a weekly engagement, he didn't suspect a thing. Goodbye red player.\n\nTUESDAY: Everyone tried to get in on the action today. The girl masquerading as the Dark Elf (who was wearing either black or red) and the sociology major lived to see another day. The purple player was able to catch the obliging yet naive green player by calling her and pretending he had car trouble.\n\nWEDNESDAY: The biology major (who was still \"alive\") was surprised to hear that the Psychology major, who wasn't Anabel the art history major, ambushed Night Stalker as he slept in his dorm.\n\nTHURSDAY: The black player was declared the victor after luckily spotting \"Billy\" on his way to Mammalian Physiology, a class required by his major.\n",

There are no scales, however there is a see saw.You can only use the see saw 3 times. How do you work out which one is heavier?\n\nMy solution:\n\n[spoiler](#s \"I labelled them 'a' through 'l' for clarity.\nWeight a,b,c,d,e,f against g,h,i,j,k,l. Let's say side a-f is heavier(if not, you apply the following logic  to g-l). This means that the heavier person is within the group a-f.So, then you weigh a,b,c against d,e,f, if a,b,c is heavier, you then weigh a against b(if not, you apply the following logic  to d,e,f). If either side is heavier, you can tell from the scales, if not, it means both are the same weight, therefore c is heavier by the process of elimination.\")\n\n[The Actual Solution can be found here](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/9979/brooklyn-99-riddle-weighing-islanders)\n\nWhere did I go wrong?",
