Most of the time, it is empty when the food gets to the table. More and more, it seems like my water either doesn't get filled or only gets filled once. I drink quite a bit of water and it really bugs me. I'm not the type to say anything, though. I just feel like this has become more of an industry standard lately, to not refill water since they usually don't charge for them, and it really drives me nuts.",

We don't do discounts, pay it fully \\*throws check on the table and leaves\\*  \n\n\nSome waiters we spoke to were also furious with the manager and said he was usually just as rude to customers and asked us to complain to upper management for them, they also said a ton of tables walked out and that they were planning on quitting because they were the ones dealing with the management overselling spots with only a small amount of staff, we ended up paying it fully but we aren't going back.",

They were talking the whole time, so after this, the girl just stared at him.

As I was writing out the tip on the receipt, the girl came up and said “I sit over there, can I just pay for my portion now ?” Her boyfriend was behind her, still asking “are you mad” but he wasn’t giggling this time.\n\nI couldn’t help but eavesdrop and slowly right my signature.

        "text": "This is a story about how a group of teenagers screwed over my favorite restaurant. I have a favorite Korean BBQ restaurant that serves the best food. They are pricey but the food is worth it. This weekend my best friend and I decided to go to the casino and we ended up winning a couple hundred dollars so we decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner at our favorite restaurant. We arrived and were seated and decided to order a whole bunch of food and try some new dishes. The waitress was new and shadowing but her trainer recognized us and asked if we were okay with her serving us alone because they were super busy and we are regulars.  We didn’t have an issue with it so we ordered our food.  A few minutes later a group of teenage boys sat down next to us. \n\nAbout five minutes later the waitress came out with the first part of our order.  As she was walking by their table they stopped her and demanded she take their drink order. She set the food down on the empty table next to them and wrote down what they wanted.  While her back was turned one of the boys started eating some of the food off the plate.  She finished taking the drink order and then turned around and picked up the plate and gave it to us and walked away before we could say anything.  We were appalled.  The boy who did it looked at us and laughed.  \n\nWe got up and went to find the waitress. While we were gone the rest of our food was dropped off.  We returned to find the other party had helped themselves to our food!  One was filming it with his phone. They had just grabbed forkfuls of food and when we came back they quickly sat back at their table and were doubled over laughing. The waitress didn’t know what to do and ran back to find the waiter.  Meanwhile the group grabbed a few more bites of our food and then ran out.  On the way out the last guy yelled “Thanks I really enjoyed dinner!”   The waiter and waitress came back and she was in tears and they apologized profusely.  The restaurant remade our food and gave us a discount because of what happened.  I still can’t believe it!  \n\nTl;dr: Went out for a nice dinner and it was ruined by a bunch of teenagers who thought it would be funny to steal.",

We arrived a little early so we we’re waiting on the bar and we we’re happy about it but they didn’t actually sit us until way longer than our reservation had actually started and there were visible empty tables. \n2. My husband had already tipped 20 percent for our drinks at the bar but they hadn’t finished our second round when they came to get us for the table so they made him stand there and wait for them and bring them himself to our table.\n3. While I was at the table waiting for my husband the waiter came twice to try to take drink orders and got annoyed when I said I wanted to wait for my husband to order.\n4. The waiter wouldn’t let us order appetizers without ordering entrees even though my husband was still deciding and he had given us less than a minute to decide so he got annoyed again. \n3. They didn’t list the ingredients and added their “ own fun twist” on a classic dish by adding an ingredient my husband is allergic to, we did mention it but the waiter seemingly got annoyed yet again so I said I’ll eat it, later someone else did come to offer to make another but we said it was ok.\n4. The entrees took a very long time to arrive for us and  everyone around us, the kitchen was open so we could see they were playing a game.\n5. They started to get pushy to getting us to order more drinks when we were on our 4th and 3rd cocktail respectively and they weren’t empty yet.\n6. We felt pressured to leave and we were already so full so we ordered dessert to go.\n7. We we’re actually not mad at all so far but my husband went to the bathroom as I was going to pay the check and the waiter kinda threw my card at me so that’s what made me kind of annoyed.",

No other checkers came out. He kept ranting and the cashier called again. She told the man that the next available checker would come out at 3:00 PM and it was only 2:30 PM. \n\nThe reason why I did not confront him or stand up for the cashier was because all the stuff he was saying was correct and plus my cashier was brash and not too nice anyways. My grandmother looked at him and did a fake laugh in agreement with him. At first I thought he was either a mentally ill transient person, rude, but then I realized he was SO correct and not really being that rude! Because ever since covid hit, I notice you have to wait in line forever at the grocery stores or the strip mall clothing stores and stores that do have staff available do not care about their customers. Everything that punk behind me said was all the stuff that goes through my imagination when I have to wait in long lines. \n\nAnd when I was done bagging my groceries, it was his turn, and then while he was bagging his own groceries he said to the cashier, \"See I am bagging my groceries, I am making the job get done faster, otherwise it would have been too slow with no bagger around!\"\n\nI'd say kudos to that guy, but at the same time be more polite to retail workers.

Which kept my three older brothers and me far from away the check. \n\nFast forward to when I was about 12, and my friends and I went out to eat without adults for the first time. It was an east coast chain with lots of things on a flat top and lots of ice cream. At the end, the bill was about $25. I’d never touched the check, which means I’d seen those extra couple bucks get thrown in, and understood the concept of a tip, but had no idea how to calculate it. Nobody else had any clue either so I added an extra $3. \n\nNext time I was in the car with my dad, I told him what happened and asked how to tip. From then on, every time the check was dropped, I got to grab it and estimate the tip (much to my brothers’ annoyance). And from then on, I figured out how to tip properly. \n\nMy dad and I still talk about and consult on tips (especially recently when he started getting delivery or using ride shares and I got to teach him). We were talking about it recently and I just learned that after that first snafu he actually went back to the restaurant to give the waitress the rest of her tip and a bit extra cause it was a place we went often enough, and he knew the waitress. He said, “it was my fault you didn’t know how to tip. Why should she be penalized for my mistake.”",

I hadn't had my hair cut since June this time and still an inch was too much. I'm thinking maybe next time (probably in june) I just ask for the exact hairstyle I have but a bit shorter?",

He said that unfortunately there was nothing he could do about it since it was displayed in the menus and on the host stand that gratuity was automatically added for tables of six or more, and there was 27 of us.

I just need to vent.\n\nNeed to know: I broke my ankle back in January; and spent longer than expected in rehab due to my mental illness bringing therapy screeching to a halt for about a week. My insurance assumed I was able to go home. I never informed SSI it was temporary because that's how my illness works: nothing to report because nothing was changing. I expected my mental health caseworker to be on top of it, since that kind of notification is part of her job. She didn't tell them, either. Therefore, after paying rent + utilities in February, March and April, I was wrongly deemed \"permanently institutionalized\" requiring only $30 p/mo in time to return home in May.\n\n\nA charity took over paying my rent and utilities in May. On the assumption it was short term.\n\n\n\"Short term.\" Right.\n\n\nApparently, the charity of the charity ran out in September. I'm not told the rent is no longer  being paid. I assume it is. Mental illness is a bitch.\n\n\nI now have a legal guardian, who was never told the true situation about my rent. They thought it was being taken care of.\n\n\nMy caseworker was beyond frustrated SSI is dragging its heels restoring my benefits, despite having been provided rent payment receipts by the rental office. At this point, I don't think they have the slightest intention of restoring my benefits coz my caseworker kept getting told an \"overpayment\" needs to be repaid! Do they mean just the 3 months they paid for my rent + utilities earlier this year; or are they including the eff up when my SSI started and my mothers Will paid an allowance, because her lawyer was too incompetent to admit he needed to research SSI benefit rules? They'd been withholding $10 p/mo to repay that the past several years.\n\n\nSo, anyway, I got an eviction notice after getting but not yet meeting my new caseworker. Who spoke to the rental office on my behalf; and was floored by the fact that A) my rent hasn't been paid for months, and B) my guardian was equally uninformed about the rent.\n\n\nThis close to Christmas, and we have a mad scramble. The manager's hands are tied: the order comes from her bosses.\n\n\nWth am I supposed to do? I was lied to by my former caseworker. I was put in this mess by a caseworker who let me down. I guess she was over her head, but...\n\n\nHelp?",

        "text": "I just want to preface this by saying that I am always a very easy going customer, I literally never complain, I order what's on the menu, and just quietly get on with my meal. I have sometimes found a hair in my food, and just took it out and carried on eating. Having worked in the food industry a few years back, I know it's a very demanding job, and sometimes people make mistakes, and that's perfectly fine. But that one restaurant meal, a few years back, was the most baffling experience of my life, and as I recently got reminded of it, I thought I would share it here!\n\nAs I mentioned, it was a valentine's meal, but we had decided not to celebrate it on the day, but rather the day before or after (I can't quite remember), just to avoid the crowds of people and have a quiet evening.\n\nMy then-boyfriend / now husband had booked a table for 7pm at this Italian restaurant. We arrived maybe 5 minutes earlier, and as planned, the restaurant was basically empty, there was maybe one or two other couples in a room of about 30 tables. The waiter who welcomed us confirmed our reservation, but then proceeded to say that we needed to sit down in a waiting area while they got our table ready. We then had to wait for about 25 mins there, even though every single table in the restaurant was already clean and dressed. The waiter kept going in and out of the kitchen, always empty handed, but never prepared a table for us. He eventually just came back for us and took us to a random table that had been ready since we arrived..\n\nHe then came back about 15 minutes later to see if we wanted any drinks, and we asked for two small glasses of red wine.\n\nA few minutes later, he comes back to take our food order, and about 15 minutes later, the food turns up, but we still don't have any drinks, so my boyfriend politely enquires about them, to which the waiter replies \"mmh yeah... I'll see how the wines are getting on...\", as if it needed to be cooked or something 😅 \n\nFrom where we were sitting, we could clearly see the bar area, empty, and the bartender, just casually leaning on the counter and chilling. We see them talk for a few minutes, before they actually bring us... two very large glasses of red wine. My boyfriend then tells the waiter that he can either give us the drinks but make us pay for the price of the small glasses, which is what we ordered, or take these back and give us two small glasses instead, whatever is easier for them. The waiter just had this very confused look on his face, and just said yes, while very obviously pretending to write something down on his notebook. Weird, but OK 🤪\n\nSeveral minutes later, the manager then comes to see us, and brings us another two large glasses of red wine. At this point, no one had taken away our first drinks, so we now had 4 untouched very large glasses of red wine. So we explain once again, that we only wanted two small glasses, not 4 large glasses. In the end, they take away two of the glasses and leave the other two for us to drink.\n\nAt this point, we are already half way into our meals, and we just finish eating and decide to not have desserts. We then ask for the bill, which again takes about 10 minutes, even though the restaurant is still completely dead, and lo and behold, we have 2 larges glasses of wine on the bill. So we ask the waiter to change the price for two small glasses, since that was our agreement. \n\nThe manager comes back with the amended bill, and we ask to split the bill in half, to which he replies \"romance is dead!\" We try and laugh it off, and my boyfriend is about to pay, when he realises that the manager put the full amount on the card and tried to trick him into paying the bill for me too.. He politely asks again to split the bill, and the manager reluctantly obeys, while adding comments saying that men should pay for women, and that his own wife, I quote, \"rapes his credit card, left, right and centre\".. He then proceeds to ask how long we've been together, to which we reply \"6 months\", and he just says \"I give your relationship 3 months\".\n\nSuffice to say we left and never came back! 😅\nAnd now that we have been together for 7 years, and married for one, it remains a fun weird restaurant story to tell people..!",

What should've been a simple sign up and verification process has turned into one of the most infuriating customer service experiences I've ever had.\n\n1-) I registered my personal information and it asked me for a credit card for verification. Okay, I've done this stuff before, should be easy and quick. Registered credit card number 1: verification went through on my side. On the website: \"unhelpfully vague error message, try again\". Okay, let me try credit card number 2. Same thing, billing goes through, but received an error with no feedback. I try again wit both cards a few more times, no success.\n\n2-) Strange, I check my bank and everything on my side checks out. Contacted first support link and explained the situation, asking for guidance. Received a reply with no solution, only saying that the problem has been solved and that the support ticket has been closed. \"Weird\", I think.\n\n3-) Try to register my card again. This time I'm directed to another support email address. Once again I explain my issue. They reply the exact following: \"We have reviewed your account/transaction and will not be able to offer services. No further information will be disclosed regarding this matter.\" Okay, not only this is the strangest customer support message I've ever received, but also this is getting infuriating now.\n\n4-) Maybe it's a system error, let's try to register again. Now I receive a pop-up: \"Upgrade cannot be performed. This expired, canceled, or suspended account cannot be reactivated\". Okay, now my account got canceled for some reason? And I can't try to register my email again, it says there's already an account registered with that address.\n\n5-) Okay, let's try to reactivate my account. I'm redirected to customer support and asked to log in. Oh no! I can't access customer support to solve the issue of my canceled account because I need to have a valid account to access customer support... At this point I'm done.\n\nIt sincerely baffles me how this is coming from this huge billion-dollar company. Seriously, if they just paid an intern to just build a customer-service chatbot using their own all-powerful AI Sherlock-Holmes-Sidekick this would be much easier. This just seems like something out of customer-service surrealistic dystopia,  I'm not expecting a solution at this point, I'll just take my business elsewhere.  \n\n\nTLDR: Interacting with a tech giant's customer service feels like having a fever dream.",

        "text": "This particular national brand pet store is well known for hiring people who don't know much about pets, despite claiming to be intelligent (or a mart for multiple pets depending on how you read the sign). And a lot of people have had horrible experiences at this store (myself included in a few cases), but I wanted to share the story of how an employee at this one particular store helped save the life of a lovebird.\n\nTo explain; this lovebird was one of two (no, they were not a mated pair; I strongly suspect that they were siblings) that belonged to one of the fellow members of my grandmother's church. Well, that member passed away and their family didn't want the birds, so they ended up getting passed from church member to church member as they tried to find someone who would take care of them. Grandma remembered that I used to have birds (two parakeets), and figured I'd be the best to take care of them.\n\nI was *woefully* unprepared for lovebirds. They are not like parakeets *at all*, but I did everything I could to try and be their forever home. A few months after they came into my care, one of the birds began obsessively plucking. The bird was clearly uncomfortable, constantly moving, feathers never fluffing, eyes pinning, and I had no idea what was wrong. Everything I could find online said *go to vet*. Only problem is that the majority of vets in my area cater to dogs, cats, horses, pigs, sheep, and cows. Birds aren't really on that list. I was driving past the animal shelter when I remembered that they sometimes get chickens turned over, so I went in and asked for what vet they take animals to. They sent me to their vet of choice.\n\nI went in, explained my situation to the young woman behind the counter, who nodded and began talking about the cremation fees and that I'd have to find my own \"cremation containment unit\" for my pet's ashes, because they didn't sell those. Bear in mind, they hadn't even *seen* the bird yet. Just a rough description of what was wrong with him. I was devastated. I was in shock.\n\nI made my way to the pet store (which happened to be near the vet) and was in bird supplies when I was hit with the overwhelming realization that *my bird was probably going to die*, which would lead to the other one dying, because birds need flocks and I had no access (or funds) to buy another lovebird. I'm standing there, quietly losing my mind, when an employee asks me what was wrong. The whole story spills out and the young man nods and says \"Sounds like your bird developed an allergy.\"\n\nRecord scratch. What? That's a *thing*? Birds can get allergies?\n\nYes, dear reader. Yes, they can. The employee recommended a specific, allergy free bird food (which, bonus, had less waste than the food they *had* been eating up to that point), so I bought it and took it home and switched their food (making sure to thoroughly dump, wash, and dry *everything* to avoid cross contamination in case that was the issue)--and the problems cleared up. My bird started relaxing, stopped picking at the skin (which was what happened next after the feathers on the chest were all plucked out) and calmed down. I had to be extra careful to make sure the bird didn't catch a chill (no feathers to insulate the chest), but it survived several more years.",

On their PayPal bill they “remind” me that separating shipments (I never asked them to) means higher shipping costs.\n\nSo I wrote this email but haven’t sent it yet:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Dear POP\\*,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Holy cow! $35.74 in new shipping costs? That’s more than the price of the item. I’m sorry, I thought the full price included shipping and handling, period. I didn’t know about the hidden tax on preorders.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But seriously, I think I’d talk to the owner and let him know about the policy. Has he thought it through? A good customer might think something like,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*“OK. If we’re keeping a tally of order-external and order-future shipping costs might put me ahead, balance wise. If you decide to not ship I can tally up my receipts from all my past returns on damaged items and tally them up.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*“Never mind! I just found out that your shipping cost surprise will end up saving me $70! The $953.26 order I placed with you last month is only $884.98 at BigBadToyStore. I wouldn’t have learned about them if you hadn’t told me about the floating shipping charges policy. Thanks!”*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Such thoughts really could happen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Well, it’s up to you. If you send it, that would be a high-integrity move and good for business. On the other hand, you do have a policy that explicitly lets you get away with it. One lost customer is just a drop in the bucket.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Please let me know your choice. Thanks for all your help in the past. I know you’re just following orders—no hard feelings. I already know that jacking up the shipping is SOP for a lot of eBay and Etsy type businesses. \\[\\[This is sarcasm—they’re a big company.\\]\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;P.S. — I just set up a sample order on your website and discovered that your shipping fee “tax,\" which in my case more than tripled my shipping cost, isn’t mentioned on *any* of your pre-order pages. Do you guys want to fix that yourselves before someone else exposes this on social media?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Because your 346% shipping tax is certain and systematic, it *will* occur on all mixed orders, minimal decency and PR sense says you should warn your customers about it on your website up front, not on a back page. Telling a customer he has to pay $87 for a $35 Aurora repop because his order *was necessarily separated*, and known in advance of the “final” price calculation, is shocking.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Since you know *in advance* that ***every*** order that contains a pre-order will ***necessarily*** be jacked up, your ***prices are systematically misleading all the time***. And it’s not even “in the small print”—the tax is not mentioned on the product or the order pages *at all*. Check it out for yourselves! And let the owner know about the pending PR disaster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. *Am I in the right, or are they?*\n2. *Is it really common knowledge these days that final payments for online purchases really aren’t final?*\n3. *Should I send the email? Or just pay the surprise shipping tax?*\n4. *Should I cancel my three additional pending orders, all of which include pre-orders?*\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n\\[\\* POP, not his real name, helped me a year ago after his co-workers tried to scam me after sending me a damaged item. An amazing story that I can paste later, if anyone is interested. Outline: Guy A screws up; I tell guy B; B says A could never do that, he’d be fired; I show evidence; A and B both driop off the map; I tell guy C—POP— and he fixes it immediately.\\]",

        "text": " My freshly 16 year old friend had just gotten her license, and I was still 15 at the time. Her parents planned a party/trip about a 4.5 hour drive from our hometown in California since now she could drive herself and me in our own car, and her brother could drive himself and his friends. It was supposed to be like a rite of passage or something since they did the same thing (planning a big driving trip) when her older brother/sister got their licenses. \n\nHer parents left a couple hours ahead of us, and we decided to get brunch on our way and stopped at a random restaurant during brunch hours, around 11am. It wasn't very packed but there were a few families with children eating there. At no point were we asked for ID.\n\nShe asked the waitress if they had iced tea, to which the waitress said they \"could do that for her\". I ordered an iced coffee. The waitress brought my friend her tea in a huge glass, umbrella, and cocktail spear with fruit on it, which both of us remarked as being \"fancy\", and the waitress laughed. My friend gave me the umbrella, which I put in my iced coffee.\n\nMy friend basically slammed it since it was summer and it was hot outside, and asked for a refill which the waitress got for her. About 25% of the way into the next iced tea she realized she was getting inebriated and asked if the iced tea had alcohol, to which the waitress became defensive and said \"it's a long island iced tea, which is what you asked for\". We told her that she just wanted a regular iced tea and that we were minors, so she just took the long island iced tea away and brought out a plain iced tea in a plain glass. When she returned with the iced tea, she said I had to take the umbrella out of my iced coffee because it was an alcohol marker and made me give it to her, which I felt was way overkill and also just not true in most restaurants.\n\nAt this point, my friend, who had no real previous experience with alcohol, was already kind of fucked up from the 1.25 long island iced teas and couldn't drive, basically trapping us at the restaurant as I did not even have my permit yet at the time. After this the waitress became pretty rude with us, not only taking away my drink umbrella but dropping off the food without saying anything and rushed away (she actually gave us opposite dishes and we had to swap) and refusing to come by again to bring napkins or refill water, which my friend needed to help sober up.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes, now around 12:15 pm, the waitress brought the bill unprompted and told us that the restaurant was closing in 15 minutes. The bill charged us like 24 dollars for 2 long island iced teas, which she refused to strike from the bill even when we said she only drank about a fourth of the refill and didn't ask for/want either drink. We called her dad and he said it wasn't worth it to fight her, so we just paid and tipped a very small amount, and the waitress basically immediately boxed up our food and kicked us out as soon as she returned, despite other people still sitting and eating unrushed.\n\nThe restaurant was off the highway and literally could not be exited or even crossed on foot without driving to exit. We had to go out to the car my friend still couldn't drive. Looking back I think the waitress realized she could get jail time/fired for serving minor alcohol and wanted us out of there asap and that's why she was rude and pushy with us, which she didn't even apologize once for.\n\nWe turned on the AC since we were now trapped in the car. Of course, we did not realize it because we were dumb kids, but by spending another hour waiting for my friend to sober up in the ac without turning the engine on we basically killed her battery, and the car wouldn't start when we tried to turn it on, fully trapping us in the parking lot. \n\nHer whole family was at the destination by this point, including her brother and his friends in their car, so I had to call MY dad who was at work at the time to come and jumpstart her car, which again was like a 45 minute drive out of town. We had to wait for him which took another hour and half since he didn't leave right away and were very late and in bad moods when we finally got to the destination after another 3 hour drive, and we probably shouldn't have driven there the whole way after just jumpstarting the battery but there were no further issues. \n\nIt's kind of just become one of those stories her family tells, but looking back I kind of think we should have tried to sue. This happened about 6 years ago so it's too late now, but in my opinion the waitress really should've been held accountable for basically spiking a minor's drink and stranding us, kicking us out early to seemingly cover her own ass. The whole experience made me scared of driving when I started driving and scared of alcohol for a time, and soured our vacation since she kind of failed the rite of passage driving trip through no fault of her own. \n\nI know there was that one case with a 5 year old who was served a long island iced tea and the mother got like 75,000 dollars, but what would've been the likely actual consequences if we had tried to take legal action as 16/15 year old's and not young children? Should the waitress have been fired or the restaurant fined/liquor license revoked? Is this one of those things that just kind of sucks for everyone and we were better off not trying to sue? Overall it was one of the worst dining experiences I’ve had, the food wasn’t even good. ",

It does stem from a nightmarish experience trying to get my phone number ported to a new carrier, whom we'll call \"CallFling XnLimited.\" I tried to activate a new phone, and the company ended up failing to port the number correctly, resulting in the phone number I've had for the past 15 years being lost to the ether. I'm now crawling back to my old provider and getting a brand new number, my first since I got my first cellphone in high school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nXnLimited has god-awful customer service. I suspect it's less the fault of the representatives on the other end of the phone and more to do with XnLimited's policies. Over the past three weeks in which I have not had a working phone, I've spent a lot of time interfacing with their customer service representatives. I know from my experiences working retail that usually it's the angriest customers who get compensated the most. I'm absolutely livid about my experience with , but I'm also sane enough not to take it out on the poor people this shitty company has put forth as sacrificial lambs to bear the brunt of their customers' justifiable anger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI googled around to try to find articles that talk about this before posting here, but I could only find tips on how to \"be a better customer service rep\" which just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Why should customer service reps have to work harder and take responsibility when it's their company with the terrible policies?",

It was close enough that it was less than a 5 min drive but far enough away that I couldn't walk and have hot food.\n\nI had been cleaning and was greasy and sweaty, plus the drive thru was always busy so I decided to order Mackies through Boober Beats. I ordered for both my partner and I, totalling around $20 or so worth of food plus 99 cent delivery fee and waited.\n\nThe driver comes and I meet him in the driveway where he hands me my food and I notice it's a little...light. Sure enough, I check the bag to find a single burger, nothing like my order. This had never happened to me before so I ran back to the driver and explained it wasn't my food.\n\nDriver: \"No madam, I grabbed the right code.\"\n\nMe: \"Bruh, I ordered 4 burgers and 2 fries. This isn't my food.\"\n\nDriver: \"Then they gave me the wrong bag.\"\n\nMe: \"You gonna go back and get my food then?\"\n\nDriver: *Starts backing out of my driveway* \"No madam, I delivered the food.\"\n\nMe: \"NO YOU FUCKING DIDN'T. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?\"\n\nDriver: \"Not my problem.\" \n\nAnd he fucking drives away.\n\nNow, I own a car and my order was out of being filthy and laziness but this was still ridiculous. I obviously gave the driver a 1 star, took back my tip and had to explain everything to Boober when I combed my hair and found pants.\n\nI made my way to Mackies, in all my sweaty glory and explained what happened. The cashier apologized and handed me the real bag explaining that they leave the orders on a seperate counter and the drivers are the ones who match with the # and take it. I check on my food which is now cold and ask sweetly if they could remake it. Which thank god they do. The cashier however, is now pissed. Not at me but it starts ranting about how now they have to remake 2 orders because of that idiot. I get my fresh food. They apologize again and I do as well. \n\nThe second I pull into my driveway I get a notification that I was refunded so...yay free food?\n\nTDLR; Boober Beats Driver is a boob",

Never mind. Cancel the order. She said it and MY PASTRIES were her treat and not to worry, she hoped I found my card 😭😭😭. I know that when the customer literally says \"never mind\" before the coffee is even made, they probably don't look sketch. But I still felt so skeezy and bad. And indebted to her kindness.\n\nThen Googled the local Italian restaurant with a bad feeling in my stomach because... I know the trend. Sure enough, \"Opens Tuesday at 5 pm.\" Not great news at 11:30 Monday morning. I got their voicemail but thank GOD for Facebook. My waitress must have either been co-owner or manager because she told me (via the page) who she was and they indeed had my card. I checked my funds every day so I knew it wasn't stolen (I hadn't planned Mayo to ask me to come back Monday, so while I had funds for a weekend I was watching my spending).\n\nThe staff were onsite making pizzas. All smiles when I knocked/walked in the back door the day they were CLOSED, even asked how my meal was the night before. \n\nI wish so bad I could break the rules here and \"name and shame\" both this wonderful bakery and Italian restaurant. My bf said of course they were nice because they want your service. But I had already paid and tipped. I know restauranters can be pretentious and they were within their right to tell me NO or add a convenience fee. It was up to them whether I drove home without a debit card today.\n\nSunday night there had been a 1 hr wait for dinner but I'd driven by a coffee shop that was obviously open with patrons, so I asked if I could come back. Between the coffee shop's cocktail menu, checking out a brewery before that and the bartender/barista mistakenly thinking I ordered a second drink (not like I said no) my buzzed ass DEFINITELY spent dinner trying to get my pasta to soak it uppppp. I felt better by the end of my meal but I obviously still left a tip and walked out without a card 🤦‍♀️.

        "text": "My partner has a Bloomingfail's account she rarely uses. I think she created it to order a single promotional item many months ago. Fast forward to yesterday. All of the sudden her inbox (email) is unexpectedly flooded with over 60 random \"thank you for subscribing\" to various spam mail services. Because she misses zero details, she sees (buried inside all these mails) a \"thank you for you order\" mail from Bloomingfail's, followed by another email shortly after notifying her that her email / account credentials had been updated in the Bloomingfail's system....\n\nShe opens the mail, and  sure enough, someone had just placed an $800 order, shipping to her name, at an unknown address, in another state. Obviously she tries to log into her account, but she is locked out as the perpetrator has migrated the account to themselves after order #1.  \n\nFirst call she makes is to American Express who immediately jumps into action and closes her card to minimize any further exposure considering these asshats have all of of information including name, address, phone, email, credit card info etc. \n\nNext call is Bloomingfail's. Not kidding the automated phone system is garbage. She is disconnected 6-7 times while also being forwarded to phone lines for unrelated departments across the mix. Zero exaggeration here. It took her almost an hour to find someone willing to help. Once she got someone, his first comment was to make an excuse that during holiday season, this type of fraud is \"common\" and to be \"expected.\" After that he asks some real questions. \n\nQuestion #1 from him: \"Was this fraud committed with \\[her\\] Bloomingfail's credit card?\" She does not have one, so the answer is \"NO.\" She informs him that they had used her personal credit card information that was stored in Bloominfail's system \\[tied to her account\\]. The tone to a huge turn at this point... He basically said, she was on her own and suggested she call American Express. She let him know that was already taken care of. Clearly this customer service agent did not give a f\\*ck as this fraud didn't seem to effect Bloomingfail's in any negative way.\n\nQuestion #2 form him: \"Is there anything else we can help you with?\"  She told him yes, I do need your help...\n\nFirst, she asked him if he could please get \\[her\\] back into \\[her\\] account so she can delete all her information as the account it is clearly not secure. He asked for her account information... Then told her, he could not get her into the account, as her email and login credentials no longer matched the account.  She explained to this dipsh\\*t that the thieves just changed all this providing details from the recent Bloomingfail's mail and order reference \\[previous and past\\] as evidence that someone had hacked their system and her account. Silence. He basically said he could not grant her access to an account she did not have access credentials for. I'm not making this shit up.\n\nSecond, she asked him to cancel the pending  \\[fraudulent\\] order that was shipping to her name. with some random stranger's address in another state. She expressed (he/they) \\[Bloomingfail's\\] have just been notified that the order in question was in FACT fraud. Silence. He would not cancel the order.\n\nWe hung up in disbelief. Clearly Bloomingfail's wanted to keep the order as they make the money here no mater what... Essentially partaking in a know fraudulent transaction with no reason to care otherwise. \n\nI mean, seriously we are not making any of this up.\n\nThe only upside is that Bloomingfail's did in fact ship the order today. Since the item was shipped in my partner's name \\[with appropriate billing information attached\\], she was able to log into UPS and redirect the package to a hold location \\[next to our house\\] that requires ID for retrieval... Plus we live about 3 states away. So these crooks can't get their hands on this order no matter what. Once we receive the order we will turn it over to the local police (or American Express) as stolen property.\n\nI'm also seriously contemplating shipping a box full of d\\*cks / dildos to the address with a big \"F\\*ck you!\" note inside. Just because. These thieves are nothing more than a box of d\\*cks. LOL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

After handing in a car, the leasing company always does a checkup and lists all the defects that are not due to what is considered \"common use\". Things like small scratches around the door handle are considered normal, but rips in the fabric are not. When the amount of damage goes over a certain threshold, you get charged for some of it.  \n\nToday, I received the overview of my damages and, amongst other minor things, they listed damage to my driver's side floor mat. The issue with it is that whenever I get into the car (which is pretty low), I put on foot on the mat and then slide in, which sometimes causes the mat to fold over. After 4 years of doing that, the mat was nearly ripped in 2 on that fold.  \n\nThe problem is that those are MY floor mats. The car initially came without mats and I bought them 4 years ago with my own money to make sure I don't fuck up the floor of the car from continuous use. I left them in the car because I had no use for them anymore. They were worn out and my new car is a different type and model.  \n\nAt first I thought they just made a mistake and thought the mats belonged to the car, but then I realized they also go over all accessories to make sure nothing is missing when you hand in a car, so they must have known the mats weren't theirs.  \n\nThis will probably be cleared out pretty easily, but I'm still a bit annoyed by it.",

Recently came back from the US (I’m from the UK) and was surprised by the experience I had in the airport\n\nSo I went to the famous red and yellow fast food restaurant as I was waiting for my flight yesterday. I was with my mum, we knew we’d be eating on the flight so we just got a cheeseburger each. They also gave us one ketchup tub. We asked for another ketchup (we both like dipping burgers into ketchup, which I thought was fairly normal) and they just completely refused. \n\nWe thought maybe they hadn’t realised they’d not given us two, but no, they literally wouldn’t give us one ketchup each because “it’s one ketchup per combo”. We hadn’t even ordered a combo to warrant the first ketchup so idek what logic the cashier was trying to follow. She offered me a BBQ sauce but I was literally just asking for one single ketchup. She was also super rude and combative. I’ve worked in hospitality and customer service, I know how hard it is, but I would have been reprimanded had I spoken to a customer like she did. Also, I’m always polite to waiters, cashiers etc, I’m not sure why she jumped straight into being rude when I was asking pretty meekly and nicely. I mean, I saw the box of ketchups and there were some there, it’s not like they didn’t have any to give me \n\nIn the UK I’ve never ever had this issue, if I go to the counter to ask for a sauce they always give me 2 or even 4 at times. I know it’s silly but I don’t get why they made such a big deal over one sauce. It’s not like I’m asking them to remake something, or do a special order. It’s one ketchup.",

For example; let's say the show you want \"offically\" premiers on Jan 1 2023 for cable. If you subscribe, you'll get the episode a week earlier on Dec 25.\n\nEverything was working normally until epsiode 6 was set to premier...and it didn't. No problem, must be a glitch. I wait a day. Still not up. I unistall Rainforrest and re-install. Nope. I wait another day. Nope. I check via laptop. Nope. I go on reddit and sure enough, others are having the same problem but the CHANNEL direct app has the episode up.\n\nI call Rainforrest and explain the situation to the lady who clearly won't deviate from the script.\n\nLady: \"M'am, I checked CHANNEL and it says the episode doesn't premier until X.\"\n\nMe: \"That's for cable. Subscribers get the episode a week early. I've been getting every episode a week early without problems until now.\"\n\nLady: \"They may have been uploading them early by mistake.\"\n\nMe: \"No. This is normal if you're subscribed. This is the ONLY episode that hasn't been uploaded. I'm not the only one with this problem.\"\n\nLady: \"M'am, I checked CHANNEL and it says the episode doesn't premier until X.\"\n\nMe: *getting frustrated* \"NO, that's the CABLE release date. If you're subscribed you get the episodes a week early. There's a problem on your end because CHANNEL has the episode up.\"\n\nLady: \"M'am, you have CHANNEL and episode is not up because it premiers on X date.\"\n\nThis agonizingly goes back and forth for some time.\n\nMe: \"I subscribed through YOU so I wouldn't have to make another account yet the new episode isn't on Rainforrest. The forum is saying that CHANNEL has the episode up so why isn't it up on YOUR end? It's the same damn app.\"\n\nLady: \"The episode is up directly through CHANNEL?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes.\"\n\nLady: *Sarcastic tone* \"Well then subscribe directly through them.\" \n\nShe then HANGS UP ON ME!\n\nI ended up unsubscribing and making a account directly through CHANNEL and WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT? THE EPISODE IS THERE. For WEEKS afterwords, Rainforrest STILL didn't have the episode up but loaded everything else.\n\nTDLR: Rainforrest rep says the same thing over and over and over.",

I go to this lady to get my eyebrows done, and a while ago she did a giveaway on her Instagram where she collaborated with another small business who does lashes, and her work looked good. \n\nI have a trip overseas in 4 days which is for my sisters wedding. In the beginning of October I decided that I should book with her and I told her I wanted to book for the end of November and I asked her what her availability was. She sent me a message saying that she's busy and will get back to me. Two days later she apologiesed for not getting back to me. No big deal, life happens. She gave me her available dates and I booked for the 27th of November (which is today now).\n\nAnyways, a while back (mid October) she sent me a message saying that she's going to have to charge me $15 more because I'm late for my appointment. I was confused because that wasn't the day I booked and then proceeded to tell her that I didn't book for that day, but instead I booked for the end of November. She apologised for that. Again I thought, it's okay, things happen. \n\nThen 2 weeks before my appointment she sends a message saying that she's depressed and she thinks she's going to take a break from doing her business and that she will refund me. I got worried that I wouldn't be able to find another appointment with someone else, and just decided not to do them at all. \n\nThen the next day following that, she sends another message saying she actually will do my eyelashes if I'm still interested and that she decided to not take a break from her business after all. I was kind of annoyed at this point, but because I was unsure if I'd find anywhere else to do them, I told her that I'll still go to her to do them.\n\nI was relieved that I was able to now go do my eyelashes. But now, the day of my appointment, she sends a message saying she has to cancel because her daughter is sick and that we can reschedule for next weekend if I'd like. I won't be in the country next weekend as I'm leaving overseas in 4 days. \n\nI was soooo annoyed and told that well I understand her daughter is sick and I hope her daughter is okay, I booked far in advance to make sure I would be able to do my eyelashes and that even if I wasn't leaving the country, that I don't want to reschedule because I'm unsure she'll just cancel on me again and that I want a refund. \n\nI get things happen and I try to understand and put myself in their shoes, but at this point it's just problem after problem. I'd assume that they'd care more about their small business than just constantly messing their clients around. Anyways, that really annoyed me because now I definitely won't be able to do them for my sisters wedding.",

It  made such a difference to her to just be treated like a human being that it's now an annual tradition. We go as a family and we DO NOT shop. We just give out candy and hugs. This is how we taught our children the right way to treat retail and food service staff with kindness and compassion. I highly recommend it to everyone.

The style choices were a little odd, having three different kinds of lamps in the room.\n\nThe door was really difficult to lock and unlock with the room keys. We had to lock the knob from the inside before shutting the door whenever we left. It's just weird to not be able to stand outside the door and lock it normally with a key. The doorknob would get stuck a lot too, which made getting out of the room an exercise in hell. Stuck to the point where it would feel locked even though it clearly wasn't, and good thing there wasn't a fire!\n\nWalls were paper thin and we could hear the people in the neighboring room, who also happened to be unnecessarily loud. We were repeatedly woken up late in the evening by their loud hollering, having the TV turned up way to loud at 3:00am, and then they'd be right outside on the patio above us at 6:30am loudly talking, shouting and even arguing. The front desk was never available when we'd call to complain.\n\nThe wifi connection was awful. The wifi kept going in and out repeatedly, making it unusable. I called the front desk to complain. They said they'd reset the wifi, and that did absolutely nothing to help, if they did in fact reset it.\n\nRoom service, or a guest, left dirty towels and a trash bag in the hallway on a table, and it was still there when we left.\n\nThey did not provide shampoo, body wash or conditioner. They provided us with these teeny tiny bars of soap to wash up with. I elected to just take a shower when we returned home, rather than use the one in our room. My mother thought the shower was okay. The water pressure in the toilet was awful.\n\nRestaurant was closed on the day we were there, and when we inquired why the front desk attendant gave us an attitude. They claimed to serve a gourmet breakfast. Day one, the breakfast was this very unappealing looking oatmeal. No thanks. Day two, the breakfast was cornflakes and cheerios, plus stale bagels. I also could have done without the woman who was using getting breakfast with her very young children as a time to teach them about \"miscommunication problems\" and I could have done without her youngest son creepily lurking behind me while I was making my mother's coffee.\n\nThere were some really weird people hanging around this hotel. Some random guy on a bike approached us in the parking lot asking for directions, which was fine until he tried to keep us in a conversation and kept saying to have a nice holiday multiple times. We said have a good day and high-tailed it to our room. We'd see other random people wandering around, not looking like they were staying there, and we had to keep the blinds down all the time to avoid being peered at by total strangers.\n\nAll things considered it was a disappointing stay.",

My grocery store still has the entrance nearest the pharmacy locked, as they'd started to do during the pandemic, thus necessitating using the main entrance, then rolling across half the store. No biggie, right? Well, usually... Today, however, we had one of those meetings of presumably management blocking half the width of the front corridor. The other half was blocked by a shopping cart.\n\n\nI'm in a wheelchair.\n\n\nSo, I asked if they could please move the cart from my way.\n\n\nNo acknowledgement. No glance in my direction. No pause in their oh-so-important conversation!\n\n\nSo, I shoved it out of the way with my foot.\n\n\nThe guy nearest the cart noted its movement from behind him before he noticed me. He glanced at me and reached for the moved cart.\n\n\nNo acknowledgement. No apology.\n\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure why I'm surprised! These conversing guys seem singularly unaware of customers around them! In the past, I've asked for help while dropping something, dropped it; even broke it. Standing in their line-of-sight. *Standing* in their line-of-sight! Apparently just as invisible.\n\n\nWhat's with these clueless, oblivious guys, anyway?",

She's been contemplating using the money on heating but has decided to continue to layer up &amp; have somewhere  comfortable to sit. \n\nSo today we went to a retail park that had 6 different furniture stores. She just wanted to go to one of them &amp; try out the 3 styles she'd seen online, that had the colours she wanted &amp; thought it would be sorted. \n\nThe sales woman who 'helped' her was clearly constantly looking around for people who wanted a whole sofa set, so more commission. She made a bit of effort initially, but when my mum was disappointed about the colours not looking like they did on the website &amp; the models (in her budget) she wanted to try not being in store, she knew it wasn't a guaranteed sale &amp; stopped bothering. \nI told my mum that she should have a think &amp; come back. Sales woman practically rolled her eyes. We walked out and my mum started telling me how guilty she felt, the woman is trying to make a living, times are tough for everyone, she should just get that one so the sales woman gets the commission.\nI told her she'd saved hard for her chair &amp; she shouldn't have to compromise &amp; let's have a look around the other shops to see if we can find the right one. \nWe go to 2 other shops, the sales people were all the same. As soon as they realised she wasn't 100%, they lost interest &amp; she felt more guilty. \nShe started crying when we got out of the 3rd shop. She felt guilty spending money on a luxury item when everyone else is struggling. \nI was torn, there were still 3 more shops to try, I didn't want her getting more upset but really wanted her to find 'her chair' &amp; have something to look forward to.\nSo i got her to agree to go to 1 more store. \nYou know those little moments in life, the ones you dont even realise at the time? The ones that end up making a big difference, this was one of those. \n\nThe next store not only had the chair she wanted, comfortable, in the right colour but the sales lady was wonderful. As was her colleague who chipped in with helpful info. At this point I was trying not to cry, she was so happy. \n\nWe're going back tomorrow to buy it.\n\nMy mum has always been there for me, she stood up for me &amp; she's championed me. I'm elated we've found the one she wants. Like I said the small things.",

And before I leave we'd fist bump, high five and wish each other a nice day. The other day I decided to leave the store without saying bye to him, and I saw him glance around the shop looking for me\n\nHe stares at me repeatedly when he sees that I'm in the queue\n\nHe use to squeal a bit when he saw that I was next in line\n\nHe would open the unmanned register and ask me to go to him\n\nAnd the biggest of all, everytime I go to his checkout and hand him my stuff, hed always touch my hands. I don't know since when that has started, but since June/July this year he hasnt been subtle about it.\n\nSo on saturday I wrote him a letter since its unprofessional on his side to take out his phone while working. I asked him to read it when hes alone. In the letter I said I wont be able to go to the shop so often and if hes interested in being friends, he can contact me via my number, but if he isnt, he doesnt need to contact me. I'll still treat him the same.\n\nI gave him that letter on saturday and now its monday and I havent heard from him. I feel like I should give up on expecting a response but a small part of me thinks I should wait longer.\n\nI really liked him and I thought due to his behaviour he would want to be friends. Doesnt seem like it now though:(",

        "text": "Well it’s almost Thanksgiving. I’ve been cleaning house and taking care of animals all day when my grandmother calls me. Her streaming service is acting weird. \n\nNow this part happened before she tried calling me so I only have her description to go on but here’s the gist. At first it had switched itself to Spanish. Then it turned back to English. Then her profile was deleted. She sets up a new profile. Profile doesn’t allow her to enter her age and kicks her out every time she tries to enter her DOB. She skips the DOB. (Does not tell me about this until much later.) The profile is created and she goes to watch her shows. Her shows aren’t there and all she can get are cartoons and shows/movies rated PG13 and under. \n\nNow she finally calls me. Tells me what’s been going on. She’s describing what she sees, what she doesn’t see, how how it won’t let her go up/down/left/right. Then there’s a red line over the language select. Eventually after an hour of trying to figure out what’s going on, what she’s describing, I figure out that she has somehow gotten herself into the kids profile. I have her go to profiles to switch. Which she does.\n\nShe says “All I see is (her name) and kids next to it. No edit, nothing.”\n\nMe: “ kids isn’t below it? There’s no add profile? Moms profile? No edit?”\n\nNope. My sweet completely technologically challenged grandmother somehow managed to set her new profile to mode. \n\nWe called my mom. She couldn’t remember grandma’s password and ended up accidentally changing the password to ours to something random by mistake. She gives up. But her friend finds the services’s customer support number for us.\n\nI call customer support. A man named who I will call dude —who is amazing by the way —had the issue fixed in less than 10 minutes. But my grandmother still had issues happening and human error. Her internet cut out and she had to be walked through things step by step. Which was me. I walked her through it and didn’t let the poor guy do his job. I just know how to talk to my grandma. She has a rainforest torchbranch and this is how I have to help her with things. In fact this is paraphrasing from our convo today:\n\nGrandma while trying to sign into Hulu: “ I see signup and login now.”\n\nMe: “okay, click login now.”\n\nGrandma: “I did but it took me to sign up! I don’t want to sign up, I already have an account. How do I get out of this?”\n\nMe: “alright press that sideways U button.”\n\nGrandma: “ okay I’m back to sign up and login.”\n\nMe: “now go right and click login now.”\n\nGrandma: “I did but it took me back to signup.”\n\nMe: “on the circle press the right button and make the login box all in white. You want the box in white.”\n\nAnd then she got it an the guy logged her in remotely. \n\nAfter this everything went fairly smoothly. I now have a new hero and right now I would absolutely marry him on the spot. \n\nDude I don’t know where you are in the world or if it was  even your real name, but if you see this you are incredible. I’m sorry I took over your job when explaining things to my grandmother, I just own how to explain tech things to her in a way she will understand, it’s habit. I think you deserve a raise for putting up with us and listening to us talk about squirrels. If it weren’t for you fixing it from your computer I would probably still be on the phone explaining it to her now.",

        "text": "I was at the pharmacy today to get some meds after my dentist visit. I dropped off my prescription and went into the corner out of the way to wait. \n\n\nThere was a guy talking to the pharmacist and he had his service dog with him. The dog was wearing his vest with tags, and he had tucked himself under the counter facing outwards, keeping careful watch on everybody nearby. \n\n\nOlder entitled lady is next in line behind them, and she starts trying to coax the dog out so she can pet it. The dog is having none of this and actively moves away from her because he's well trained and focused on his task. \n\n\nThis isn't enough for her. She then crouches down and scoots closer to the dog, extending her arm and calling \"her\" out. The guy was ignoring her and just trying to finish his business to leave as fast as possible. \n\n\nOne of the pharmacy techs spoke up at the same time as myself and another person in line. The guy in line told her to stop, she ignored him. The pharmacy tech told her not to bother the dog and she replied she just wanted to pet it. Now I've had my share of ableism directed at me, and I was feeling spicy after all the pain I was in from the dentist. \n\n\nI also told her to stop, it's a service dog. She replied oh \"she\" wants it! I said no that doesn't matter. This dog is considered a medical device, and he's performing a life-saving task. You are harassing this man.. stop!\n\n\nThen she finally stepped back, and said oh I see now \"she's\" wearing a vest. We went back and forth a bit more, and I told her that because this was inside of a grocery store, they sell food, only legitimate service animals are allowed inside. She responded saying she sometimes brings her chihuahua in the store tucked in her jacket. I just said you can't do that! \n\n\nBy that time my prescription was ready. The guy and his dog left, and he thanked me on the way out. I heard some of the pharmacy employees asking each other if the lady was standing in view of the camera. I left after that, so I don't know what else the pharmacist may have said to her. Hopefully she gets banned from the store for bringing her pet inside. They could get shut down for that! And they may be feeling spicy about somebody harassing a guy who may very well be one of their favorite customers.\n\n\nI worked in pharmacy for a number of years until recently, so I've been on both sides of an interaction like this. The dog was such a good boy, working hard and never losing focus on his job. And the guy just wanted to pick up his meds like anybody else can, he shouldn't have to defend his dog every second. He probably has to deal with entitled people like this every day. That's exhausting! I hope she learned something today, but I won't hold my breath.",

I’m afraid that next time I go, it’s going to be awkward because I didn’t respond. I wish I would have at least wrote thank you on the note, but I just felt so much anxiety at that moment that my first thought was to hide it and pretend that I didn’t see it.

Receptionist is always rude but the rest of the vet staff is usually nice. Plus I’m laid back and I’ve worked in customer service jobs before, so I know how much their jobs can suck. I’m extra patient with the staff.\n\nMy dog had his annual exam there four months ago with no issues. All the tests  came back negative. As usual, the vet tech asked if he was on any medication, I told them he was on medication for flea and heart worm. Then when the vet came in, we had a whole discussion about it because I was considering switching him to a different brand.\n\nFast forward to now, the vet clinic didn’t approve my Chewy.com for his heart worm refill. I called and asked the receptionist why.\n\nAfter pulling up his file, she said he had to come in and get tested again in order for him to get the refill because he wasn’t on meds at the time of the annual exam and they need to make sure he doesn’t have parasites.\n\nI explained to her that he’s always been on meds nonstop since I got him a few years ago. She counters that I didn’t tell them. I explained further that I did. She wouldn’t budge, which I understand, it’s a liability if it’s not on their records. I’m just annoyed at the fact that I did inform them of his medication status and they failed to document it. I’m also getting less patient with her attitude at this point.\n\nThat was the last straw. I took my dog there twice before that. I wonder if the receptionist is racist based on how she always treats me compared to the other customers she treats in front of me. It’s just suspicion and I don’t always suspect someone is racist when they are being rude.\n\nSince they’re requiring blood tests again, I’m just going to switch to a different clinic that’s nicer. They saw him recently because that clinic he usually goes to didn’t have availability at the time.",

Immediately thinking I left it unzipped or it broke, I checked the wallet, but it was closed, nothing seemed off, at least to me.\n\nWhen I asked the pharmacist what he meant, he pointed specifically to the pull tab on the zipper, which was a little leather bow, put his fingers in a cross symbol and again said “you need to be careful about that”. I was so confused and must have looked it, but by then he rolled his eyes, huffed, confirmed my order with a weirdly strong emphasis on my name and finished the transaction.\n\nIt took until I was halfway home that I finally guessed what may have happened. Pharmacist and I are both of South Asian descent, and we both have very Arabic sounding names, but I’m not Muslim, he may have assumed I was? It’s possible he may have thought the bow looked like a Christian cross, but so what? It just really bothers me that he decided to assume something personal about me and make a comment. \n\nI don’t plan on addressing or taking any action because 1) rampant islamophobia, 2) he was clearly paying attention to my personal details and has system access to records where my phone / address are stored and 3) I’m not trying to cause drama, impact someone’s livelihood because I’m feeling weird. \n\nIn a world full of micro aggressions against women of color, this one took me by surprise and took up a lot of headspace.\n\nI just wanted to let it out I guess. Will not entertain any islamophobic or racist  comments.",

        "text": "Tried to post in Talesfromretail but it wasn't allowed. Seems more fitting here anyways.\n\nThis happened in the Summer.\n\nI'm a shift-lead at my local liquor store. We're on mall property so we routinely work with mall security. They're pretty great people, except for this one guy...\n\nWhile I was working a child had a medical emergency outside. Mall security was already on it so no problem. A crowd is forming so one guy comes in to ask if they can use our backroom to get the kid of the heat. I say yes and they go back there. Ambulance comes, kid is taken to hospital (he'll be fine so thank god) and we move on.\n\nI decided to take my lunch and went to find my bag to get my wallet. I can't find it. There isn't a lot of places to put stuff in our backroom and sometimes people move others things to get boxes of liquor so I assumed someone just moved it.\n\nI look and look and look...it's gone. I can't even find my clothes. I get annoyed and look at the security cameras trying to figure out where my stuff was moved. Suddenly, my heart sinks.\n\nWhile the kid was being looked at, a security guard was standing there...clutching my bag and clothes. He then proceeds to walk out WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.\n\nNow...I don't take this very well. I call up security and through panicked breathes explain what happened and tell them I need it back. The keys to close the store are in there, my wallet is in there, my meds are in there, the keys to my house and car are in there. I need my bag back ASAP.\n\nThey tell me they'll can me back. When they do, they explain that the guard said they were the mothers things, that she said they were hers. Any ounce of calm I have goes right out the window and I start screaming.\n\n\"IT'S NOT HER FUCKING STUFF! IT'S MINE! GET MY SHIT BACK RIGHT FUCKING NOW! WHERE THE HELL IS IT???\"\n\nSecurity proceeds to tell me they'll find it. They'll call around, they don't know if it's with the lady or somene else.\n\nI start hyperventiating. My co-workers are on my side and trying to get me to calm down. I attempt to call the childrens hospital to get a hold of the woman, no dice. I'm extra freaking out because I have no idea who this lady is. Just because she has a child and a medical emergency, doesn't mean she's a good person. If she has my stuff, she may never give it back.\n\nEventually, security calls me back and explains what happened. The guard saw my stuff, asked the lady if it was hers and in her distress she said yes. Once they got into the ambulance, she said it wasn't hers. Paramedics had my stuff and would be bringing it back.\n\nAn hour and a half later, paramedics and the guard show up. I'm calmer now but seething with rage. I look through all my things slowly, making sure it's all there, gritting my teeth the entire time. Paramedics are snippy towards me, saying how it was an accident. To be fair, it wasn' THEIR fault but I still don't appreciate being talked down to. It wasn't THEIR stuff that was taken.\n\nAs for the guard, had he come up to me, apologising, hat in hand and admitting fault, I would have forgiven him, just a mistake. But no.\n\nHe proceeds to puff out his chest and smugly says that he did no wrong as a child's life was in danger. Talking down to me and smirking. Asshole is acting like taking my shit was crucial to the welfare of the child\n\nI ask for all his info, once again, he smirks and give it to me.\n\nI report him to his head office ans I even called police to report him for theft purely on principal. Not allowed. Oh well.\n\nFinally take my lunch and my co-worker says two security guards are there, wanting to talk to me. I tell him they can get fucked. They hear me and one of them implores me to come out. So I do.\n\nRight off the bat they apologise. Sincerely. That the guard is in huge shit and will be punished, that they understand this was a massive fuck-up. I calm down and start apologising as well. They tell me no need and they understand.\n\nThe guard who took my stuff came in later, looking like he'd been sobbing (I guess he got reemed out) he wanted to talk to me, I said no. He's avoided me ever since.\n\nThe kid ended up being fine. The mother actually forgot her shopping in our store and came to get it. So if she DID have my things, I would have gotten them back. She was very sweet.\n\nTDLR: Security takes my bag thinking it belongs to a mother of a child in distress, drama ensues.",

He says no, the road ended. I say no, just drive and turn left.\n\nThis goes back and forth until I get frustrated and raise my voice. \"If that was my house, wouldn't you see me? It's the WRONG HOUSE. DRIVE DOWN AND TURN LEFT!\"\n\nHe finally obliges and says, \"Oh...\"\n\nTo his credit, he apologized profusely. I got my food, still hot and tipped him.

        "text": "An unknown amount of time ago, I (20s f, although I tend to look androgynous) went to a store after some photography and decided to take my camera bag with me into the store as I didn’t want to leave such expensive equipment in my car. All I had on besides my bag was worn jeans, a black graphic tee, a black hat that had a cartoon panda bear with boxing gloves on that had the words rock it on it, and tennis shoes.\n\nI barely made it through the door when I was stopped by a store employee, the one meant to check for receipts and greet people coming in. Why? Well she told me I wasn’t allowed to bring backpacks into the store. \n\nNot only had I seen people go in and out of the store with backpacks all the time, but someone happened to come in with a larger bag than I had on as she was telling me this and that woman wasn’t stopped at all. I was so bewildered and annoyed by this I blurted out “since when?”\n\nShe refused to answer that and just repeated I wasn’t allowed. I told her this was my camera bag filled with camera equipment and that I didn’t want to leave it in my car. She insisted I show her, I guess to prove I wasn’t lying? It was kind of humiliating to do so as we had quite a few people looking our way but I didn’t want to have to drive all the way back to my place, back to the store, and then drive home a third time, so I did it.\n\nThe thing about proper camera bags is that they’re separated into all these little compartments to help store all of your equipment without risking anything getting jostled and potentially damaged. Mine was like this and it was almost full, like only had room for a candy bar full.\n\nThe woman didn’t seem too happy but she decided to let me in, but it didn’t end there. She had to warn me that she would definitely be checking my bag when I left, which pissed me off even further, but I didn’t say anything except “feel free to.”\n\nTime to leave, woman isn’t even there, so I didn’t get to make a show out of it, which might have been a petty idea but I had an entire shopping trip to stew and work myself up at being treated like a criminal.\n\nBonus moment was when I later looked up if there were any rules about backpacks in the store and there weren’t. As I had been profiled before because of my clothes before as a troublemaker, that accompanied by my age made me feel like I was profiled because of it.\n\nWhy am I bringing it up now? Because I went to the same store today wearing a similar outfit but without my photography bag, and I was treated like a thief again! They went through all my bags and was double checking my receipt with everything inside. I guess I just need to stop wearing clothes I’m comfortable in.",

Once again, I tell him there is no need and I do not want that and that he has to learn boundaries.\n\nThe drunk in him thinks he is being friendly a good customer and touches my shoulder/pat on the back and I lost it and told him that's wildly inappropriate  for some old fuck to be this pushy and buying a stranger drinks and give offering them a ride home right after i told him to back off and that he needs to respect my boundaries  that I had clearly set. This was over heard by the staff because I could see their heads turn.\n\nI had left at this point. I plan to follow up because I did not make a scene (loud venue) but he should have been cut off much earlier.\n\nTLDR\nIf you're  a customer, don't be fucking creepy. If I was more drunk I would have probably let him have it, and now wish I was louder when I told him to stop being a creepy old dude.\n\nYa, fuck...thanks for letting me vent.",

        "text": "Recently went out with my boyfriend and his friends and didn’t leave a tip. I have never done this and almost always tip over 20% as I have worked as a server.\n\nWe went out to a local restaurant earlier this week. While out I ordered two Dirty Shirley’s ( Shirley temple with vodka ) and they came in two 16oz glasses. When our server brought the bill it had 2 double shot dirty Shirley’s on the tab. When the server came back I politely made them aware I didn’t order double shots. They then asked in a sassy tone if I ‘specified’ I didn’t want double shots as that is how they always come. \n\nI live on the east coast. I have never had to specify that I didn’t want a double shot at any other bar or restaurant. Even if that really is “how they come” I felt I should have been made aware of that before ordering for a number of reasons. The amount of alcohol I am consuming as I could have been driving for one, as well as the cost.\n\nAlso worth noting all of us there were 22/23 years old and none of us were carded. Felt the server may have thought we were underage/young/dumb and could make a couple extra bucks\n\nI feel bad about not leaving a tip but almost felt tricked and was angry about it in the moment. The difference was $8 which I know isn’t alot but it was more about the principal of the situation. That was about what I was going to tip so I just signed the receipt and left.\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "This summer, my extended family on one side met for our every-other-year family reunion.  We move it around every time, and this year we were in a major midwestern city wih lots of interesting stuff to do and good food to eat.\n\nWe stayed att a mid-level hotel, part of a national chain.  This particular unit was five stories, and there were a lot of people there over the long weekend of the reunion.  Some of my family had actually been there a couple of days already.\n\nThere were aspects of the hotel service that were \"above,\" and maybe even \"above and beyond.\"\n\nThe first was the shuttle service.  When I first pulled up to the location, I had kind of a sinking feeling, because this was NOT a place that was \"walking distance\" to anything.  However, it turns out that there was a fleet of guest shuttle busses, and they were on-point all the time.  We basically got rides to where we wanted, when we wanted, and when we wanted to get back, we got back in a timely manner.  We worked with three-four drivers, and my favorite part about them, aside from the fact that they were helpful and friendly, is that they were making sure to take good care of my three surviving aunts.  I know I'm not the only one in our overall group who tipped them more than once.\n\nThe second was the crew that was in charge of the complimentary breakfast.  One woman in particular picked out my most elderly, frailest aunt, and pretty much acted as a waitress to my aunt the entire time she was there.  That was definitely above and beyond  her job description.\n\nBeyond that, generally the entire staff seemed to be on top of just about everything.  It was a busy weekend at this particular hotel; beyond  our family reunion, there were at least three large wedding parties there that weekend, and everyone seemed to be getting what they needed.\n\nOh, there was one thing that did go kind of wrong, but it caused a lot of laughter.  One of my cousins needed to change rooms, and he, along with another maile relative (having a hard tiem remembering just who) took the key card and keyed into their new room.  Only, there were already people in it.  Just as my cousin opened the door, a nude woman stepped out of the bathroom, followed immediately by a nude man.  The naked couple laughed as my cousin fled.  \"Sorry to flash you!\" she apparently said as he booked it down the hallway to the elevevator.\n\nSo, thank you friendly, competent, ethnically-diverse staff at a chain hotel right off the interstate highway in a major midwestern city!  Y'all were tops!",

        "text": "First time poster and on mobile so please forgive any formatting issues. \n\nI live in Australia and moved a few months ago from an area where my internet connection was ADSL2. The most expensive type of internet. My new location meant I was finally able to get connected to the NBN. Yay cheaper and faster internet! Or so I thought. \n\nI had my NBN box installed and no internet connection. Hmm odd. Various phone calls to my provider where I received a different story each time I got a different story. Outage in my area, unknown connection issue, etc. before they finally realised they hadn’t updated my hardware with the move. My modem was okay but the cable I had was for ADSL not WAN. \n\nTwo weeks after my NBN box was installed I received the correct cable. Still no internet connection. Call the provider and was told it was an outage in my area. At this point I gave up and got my dad (who works in IT) to have a look. The modem was configured incorrectly. He resolved the issue for me. \n\nA month later the internet cuts out. My provider is unable to figure out why and books an NBN technician. This appointment was canceled and marked as resolved without anyone informing me. \nTwo weeks without internet and I’m calling my provider again. They make another NBN technician appointment. Only I am unable to get the time off work to be home for the appointment so I call to reschedule for a day my dad could be at my place and let the technicians in. Only to find the appointment has been canceled and marked as resolved AGAIN. \n\nI’m frustrated to tears. Out of the last 3 months I’ve only had internet for one month. I live alone and am a student so I’m relying on my phone to connect to the internet and it’s not cheap. I’m seriously considering asking them to wave the cancellation fee and let me go to another provider ",

        "text": "Background: My wife and I are both weird. I am white as snow, but my parents were Japan freaks when I was little and it wasn’t the craze yet (1975 and up, before I was born). My aunt dated a Moroccan who helped me enjoy spicy foods. My uncle dated a Japanese woman while in China. My wife is quarter-Lebanese, got raised by South-Eastern asians, but is mostly white too (mostly because as soon as she’s blessed with some sun rays, she becomes a nice olive brown - lucky her!). Let’s just say we enjoy a very diverse selection of foods in our home, and we both love to cook!\n\nOne thing that’s the bane of our existence is our local asian market. As we are absolutely not fitting in the mould of the place, we get very condescending « touristic » service. Asking for banana leaves took 3 trials. Getting proper herbs is not funny. When we get clerks who are there to serve « business as usual », we have no issue whatsoever. But some cannot understand we want something. Yes, we want tripe. Yes, we want bird peppers.\n\nOne of these maddening recurring article is our 20lbs pouch of glutinous rice. We eat a lot of rice: sushi rice, jasmine rice, basmati rice, but especially glutinous rice. And every single time we are about to grab that pouch, we get every employee saying it’s not the good rice, and them bringing us a pouch of cheap sticky rice. Even the cashier, before ringing the pouch, every single time, we get a « No good rice! Not good bag! Not sticky! ». Every ... single ... time ... and we have to explain that we know how to cook it. We have even to read out loud what’s written in thai.\n\nNow I understand we don’t look their typical customer, and we understand we take things whiteys usually don’t take. And I wouldn’t even care a questioning « glutinous rice? Not sticky? ». But they flatly refuse to sell things, and we have to justify ourselves so they can sell us what we want.\n\nI understand they wish to protect us, and not needing to restock, but come on.\n\nTL;DR: our local asian market are convinced we never take the good things, and will not sell us what we want.\n\nRecipe for glutinous rice:\n\n- take some glutinous rice (1lb or more), gently wash it in cold water once or twice, and then generously cover with cold water in a bowl, room temperature. Leave the rice rehydrate itself at least a few hours. Change water twice per day up to 2-3 days if you wish.\n- Fill your thai/lao steamer pot with water. Filling means 3in of water. You want to steam the rice, not boil it. So it must not touch the bamboo basket.\n- Drain your rice completely! That water is not good! Don’t wash it again, though.\n- Put the rice directly in the steamer bamboo basket, flat. Put the basket in the pot.\n- Put over Max heat. Cover with a regular pan cover. The cover should not touch the rice.\n- Once the water boils and some steam escape the top, wait two more minutes.\n- Remove the lid (careful, hot! And water vapor can scald you!)\n- Take the longer sides of the basket, take the basket off of the pot, and make the rice jump while giving a slight motion. This will make the rice go in a big ball. Turn the rice approximately upside down.\n- Put back cover, put back on boiling pot, wait 5 more minutes (3m if you let your rice soak for a day or more)\n- Remove from heat, do yet another ball, and then drop it in a service bamboo basket. This will stick, so it’s best to wash a dish towel with an odourless baby detergent, without softener, and line the bamboo basket with it.\n\nYou can look up some vids on the Net Tube. There are good ones. But as much as it seems complex, it is incredibly easy and takes little time and effort to do. It’s really forgiving too, the leeway you gain is by letting the rice be fully hydrated, even if slightly under or overcooked, it will still be good! Just don’t eat uncooked rice ever! (Potentially very harmful due to bacteria)\n\nEat with whatever you would dip bread into.",

        "text": "Okay, I would like to start off that I have worked retail for many years and I used to see people intentionally misread a promotion to get free stuff all the time, but man I am trying to figure out if I am just stupid.\n\nA coffee shop I frequent (non chain just local) posted on their Instagram, “For national coffee day we’re selling mugs and small to-go drip coffees for $1 all day!” I thought to myself, “Sweet! I need a mug, plus for $1 you can’t go wrong!” So I show up and mention the promotion and they said, “Yup we have $1 drip coffee and we ACTUALLY meant you get coffee for $1 if you bring your mug, not a $1 mug.” I got my $1 coffee and left because complaining won’t make them sell it to me for a dollar and I know how annoying it is when customers do that.\n\nLike, am I in the wrong here? Does the promotion not say they are selling mugs for $1? I despise being this guy, but I really wanted a mug.\n\nEdit: grammar as well as an update. I ended up going to the grocery store and buying myself a mug for like $4 because they didn’t have anything cheaper :(",
