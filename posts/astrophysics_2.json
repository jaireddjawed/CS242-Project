        "text": "Recently, I was partaking in a discussion about Fermi's Paradox, and someone made the argument that because the universe is *so very old*, the fact that extra-terrestrial life has not shown itself is especially strong evidence of its non-existence. But this brought to my mind an issue of relative ages; something that has always struck me is that the Earth is ~1/3 the age of the universe based on current best understanding (4.5 Gya vs. 13.8 Gya), and while 8 billions years is certainly a long time, it's not even a full order of magnitude difference. Contrast this with the relative age of multicellular life on Earth (~2.2 Gya) and the earliest known mammals (~230 Mya), a full order of magnitude difference. Though certainly much less in absolute terms, the *relative* difference is much greater.\n\nWhile I can easily find information on the age of the Earth and solar system, the question that comes to mind is at what point in the evolution of the universe do we see solar systems forming anywhere? And to make it a bit simpler, what I mean is main-sequence stars with (potentially) rocky planets in stable orbits-- is the Earth (and solar system) especially young or old relative to what we know about the formation of other similar star systems and planets? Some additional questions spring from this as well: all other factors aside, how might this influence our judgment of the likelihood of ETL arising before or even after our own time? Have there been periods of more rapid star system formation, has this process been uniformly accelerating, decelerating, intermittent?\n\nWhile it's likely that we lie somewhere between the extreme positions of \"all planets harboring life evolve exactly like Earth has\" and \"Earth is entirely unique in its evolution\", I would think that comparing to the known evolutionary history of planets and stars in the universe at large would help inform this question at least somewhat.",

Obviously, we measure stars’ lifetimes from outside their gravitational field using (as I understand it) calculations made from its size and chemical makeup. Do astrophysicists also have to factor in a star’s mass in determining when a star will die? If a star is massive enough, you would think time on the inside is slower than it is from our perspective from the outside. Wouldn’t that mean stars would burn through a given amount of fuel more slowly than if it weren’t in such a strong gravitational field, or is time dilation so slight that even in the most massive stars, the difference negligible?",

I am pretty deep into the degree, but I just don’t know if I want to do it anymore. I try to pay attention in class and take notes, but to be honest I am completely lost. The only reason I can get by is cheat sheets we are allowed to take into tests where I just copy stuff down I wrote before. I still have most of EM and quantum to take, aswell as most of the actual astronomy classes. If I switch, I would switch to Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences. I spend every semester stressed out every day because I hardly understand the concepts, and have to hunt for the homework online or get help somewhere else. I thought when I got to astro it would get better, and I still am interested in broad spectrum astrophysics, but am starting to realize I don’t have the passion or drive for it that most of my peers do. \n\nHowever, I know astrophysics is (probably) a more valuable degree than atmospheric and oceanic sciences, and part of me wants to just try and stick it out if I can and maybe minor in atmospheric instead so I have more options outside of college. I don’t think I will pursue a grad education, I don’t have the grades, any research experience, and frankly I’m just not sure I can survive that much physics. \n\nI guess I’m looking for advice from people who were in a similar situation with astrophysics or know the degree well, I have been at an indecision for months and my mind changes literally by the day. I will take any and all advice that you guys have.\n\nThank you and sorry for the long read!\n\nTLDR: dilemma with my major, don’t know if I should leave astrophysics, need advice.",

Using an FTL drive as a method of communication. There is no way around it, no real way of masking the problem either. You either embrace the complete disregard for the law of causality, and have your world built around the fact that widespread time travel just happens (which implies a need to explain away all temporal paradoxes, like the Novikov principle, or the multiple universe theory), or you throw it under the rug and ignore the issue, like 99% of science fiction.\n\nI try to keep my sci-fi hard, and even more importantly, internally consistent. I made the hard decision of including FTL travel a long time ago, but have tried to give it realistic limitations and respect the physics of the travel method I have chosen (Alcubierre's warp drive, with some modifications). Since it is VERY far future science fiction, I have given myself liberties, such as gamma ray reflectors. From the beginning however, the causality breaking shenanigans that FTL drives cause have been a thorn in my side. I have reached an impasse, and I'm deciding whether to embrace time travel or come up with some sort of handwavium explanation as to why it doesn't happen.\n\nI have come to ask, and I am asking here as I expect you lot to be much more engaged with realism than the folks over at r/scifi or r/worldbuilding , does this bother you in sci-fi? Personally if the more general physics of the setting are spot on (looking at you WW2 dogfights in space), this specific inconsistency seen in a lot of scifi properties doesn't bother me too much, and I can suspend my disbelief adequately. Though movies like Interstellar that embrace the oddness of these high concepts do make me giggle like a little child.",

The massive gravity/heat of the hole should make it that nothing touches the accretion disk before the event horizon. \n\nAfter touching the event horizon everything becomes a part of the accretion disk, however it is also now a part of the hole, it cannot “escape” that disk and exit into space. \n\nThe Accretion disk exists within our space, however the actual disk has no space within it collapsing around the black hole. If life within such a landscape was possible, it would be in a 2 dimensional format with space not existing despite the disk existing in our space, Since these things are completely inaccessible to us the only way to access the disk is to go within the black hole yourself, at which point you become a part of the hole. \n\nSo does the accretion disk exist within our space, or is it within the space of the black hole, that is within our space? \n\n- Even longer question- \n\nGoing back to if life was possible on such a landscape , the concept of space within the accretion disk would be possible,( you could surmise from the immense gravity that something exists)  however they would be completely unable to access or use it. \n\nWhat’s to say we are not in a 4D black hole with time as outer bounds of our accretion disk? We can notice the effects of it, however we are completely unable to access it. \n\n\nKnow it may be a bit out there, so sorry for the lack of facts, but just want to hear some other opinions.",

As you approach the event horizon, time will slow for you relative to outside observers until it the moment you reach the event horizon, where time comes to a stop.\n\nOur theories suggest that once your inside the black hole, there is only one path, and that is directly to the singularity. If I brought a powerful rocket down with me, and fired it inside the event horizon, not only is escape impossible, but its impossible to even slow your descent. Within event horizons, the gravity overpowers even the nuclear bonds holding atoms together.\n\nNormally, we are free to move around in space freely, but we are forever traveling forward in time, unable or to resist.\n\nIn a black hole event horizon, the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, meaning any movement that isn’t following the geodesic straight to the singularity, any resistance to the decent will take an infinite amount of energy. Similar to how time flows In one direction only, within the event horizon, your geodesic path is now restricted one direction - Your forced to follow a single trajectory,\n\nNormally we can freely move in space, but inside the horizon, it’s time that becomes malleable. C I’m not sure if this is a correct characterization, and even then, we don’t know if our theories hold up in a event horizon anyways.",

The thought experiments involved in conceptualizing special relativity seem to be very non intuitive. I don’t claim this to be perfect, please correct any mistakes I make\n\n\nImagine a static universe entirely void of any motion - each particle sits stationary. Without any motion, there is no interaction between particles, and therefor there is no flow of information\nIn such a scenario, the concept of time loses all meaning. For time to become apparent, there must be some motion between the particles— there must be some flow of energy. In such a reference frame, the concept of time loses all meaning. \nNow let’s consider the speed of light - a fundamental constant inherent to our universe. \n\nI find it best to think of the speed of light not as an object traveling through space, but as the universal limit for how fast events in one region of space can affect events in other regions of space. Essentially, it represents the speed of causality.\n\nWith this in mind, let’s assume we’re traveling at the speed of light, meaning the information stored within our reference frame is already traveling at the speed of causality. Basic algebra tells us that any additional flow of information beyond light speed must break the laws of physics by exceeding the fundamental limit on the speed of causality.\n\nFor this reason, no information can flow, meaning the particles within the reference frame will be static and unchanging, and will therefor experience no passage of time.\n\nThis explanation is a lot more intuitive than the complicated thought experiments commonly used to conceptualize relativity\n\nWhen you see the connection between the flow of time and the flow of information within a reference frame, it becomes clear that paradoxes would arise as your reference frame  nears the speed of causality unless the inherent flow of time gives way .qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq",

Unfortunately, I struggle in formal learning environments (I got my GED when I was 16) and I'm worried that attempting to go the traditional college/masters/PhD route would be a more risky idea for me than the typical person.\n\nIn terms of experience, I was working in programming languages rather than something more obviously applicable like any kind of physical modeling software, or parallel/supercomputing, etc. I do have one published paper in a non-prestigious forum (a defensive copyright paper) and [one paper in the works that I believe is worthy of publication](https://github.com/MichaelRFairhurst/entropy-debugging/blob/master/paper/entropy-debugging.pdf) but I haven't made that happen. Maybe that's my first next step -- along with refreshing my math skills. Both papers are on algorithms not relevant to astrophysics.\n\nThanks in advance for those willing to read through this and help me consider my options.",

        "text": "I'd love to get your thoughts on these ideas I came up with for replication and teleportation:\n\nI understand that as we pass time, scientists are getting better at breaking down objects to the atomic levels and being able to manipulate them.  Without manipulating the atomic structures of an object, we could eventually be able to create a 3d map the entire atomic structure.  If we had that, along with the ability to manipulate atoms, we could essentially \"print\" the same object with different atoms in a different portion of space.  For example, you could take an apple and create a 3D mathematical map of it and then send it to a device that could manipulate atoms and recreate the same apple somewhere else. This would not destroy the original apple but create a duplicate apple of the same atomic structure.\n\nTaking that technology, we could turn that 3D Map into a linear representation of binary code (1s and 0s), we could stream the data from 1 location to another and rebuild the same object.\n\nFurthering that technology, we could increase bandwidth of the code from taking those 1s and 0s and turning the 3D Map into light and send that programmed message at the speed of light from 1 origin to the destination beacon in a fraction of the time that it took to send a linear binary code.  \n\nFurthering that technology, we could take a camera, convert to an atomic recipe, send it at light speed to a distant planet in space where a beacon awaits to receive that recipe and rebuilds it on the surface of that distant planet. It takes pictures according to the programming nature of the camera, and that beacon takes the pictures and sends them back at light speed to us on Earth to rebuild digitally.\n\nFurthering that technology, we could teleport ourselves through the same means to different planets, to space stations, to the moon, or to other parts of the Earth. The paradox this creates is that after 1 teleportation, 2 people of the same DNA, same personality and memories will exist at the same time in different parts of space and could duplicate even more, essentially \"cloning\" someone or something. The only way to ethically control multiplicity is to destroy the origin object, unless the machine to create the 3D Map would break the person apart (atomically-speaking) to get a snapshot of the atoms.\n\nIt's an interesting idea I've been thinking about for the past 2 hours now after watching YouTube on why we can't travel faster than light speed and why planets even less than 1 light year are out of our reach as humans unless we can warp space and create a channel/wormhole to traverse.",

I just wanna learn about and explore space, not work on spacecraft (or missiles) like many of my aerospace peers. I know a lot of coding is required and that's more than ok with me, but I want to know how \"deep\" I'll get into the astrophysics field. And what kind of career I would have for a CS major w/data sci concentration + astrophysics minor.",
