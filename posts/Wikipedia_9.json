        "text": "Fellow Wikipedians and Wikimedians:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt has long been practice to mass upload old photos to Commons tagged as public domain without providing the required information to demonstrate public domain status (usually a publication from 70+ years ago, although this varies significantly by country). Many people add photos with questionable public domain claims and insufficient sourcing information think they are helping Wikimedia, think their assumptions of copyright status are fine, and get greatly upset when asked to provide additional sourcing information. Many think \"What's the harm? These pictures look really old anyway? Who cares?\" But there are many harms to uploading photos with sketchy public domain claims. The first being that Commons is supposed to be a site for photos under FREE licenses so that they can be reused by anyone. Saturating Commons with non-PD photos defeats this purpose and makes it harder for people to know if the photo from Commons is truly free for reuse. The second issue is that a photo with an unverifiable public domain claim may result in deletion of a better-quality fair-use photo in a local wiki, followed by replacement of the photo with the \"public domain\" one, only for the \"public domain\" photo to later be deleted and leaving articles that once had photos in them photoless. The other reason that it is bad to add photos with unverifiable PD tags is that it results in mass confusion about what the standards for copyright on Commons actually are. When a few rogue users add troves of these kinds of photos to Commons, other users quickly follow them in their mass uploading of such photos, making it appear to the average user that they don't need to add the required publication information in the source section of their uploads.\n\nLong copyright terms SUCK. Retroactive copyright laws especially suck. But mass uploading non-PD photos to Commons doesn't fix this problem. Write to your politicians and demand an end to absurd copyright terms, extensions, and provisions. Explain to them that countdowns based on year of death of the author result in millions of orphaned works thanks to the fact that most photographers aren't famous and have unknown year of death. It's easy to find the year of death for a famous artist like Walt Disney or famous photographer like Max Penson. But works by authors like Mikhail Runov (1902-?), Aleksey Mezhuev (1909-?), and many others aren't easy to calculate the expiration dates of. Write to heirs of copyrighted photos and request releases under Wikimedia-compatible licenses. Write to the media agencies of your government (be it local, regional, or national levels) and ask them to release official photos under free licenses.\n\nBut please, don't slap a PD tag on a photo you don't if it was published early enough as required for PD status in the country of origin of said photo (when their copyright term countdowns factor publication date)",

You do not have a Wikipedia account to use this.\n\nYou can find the extension here: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/old-wiki/cphagceemhgokfclmbnkpfkmchbfnclb](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/old-wiki/cphagceemhgokfclmbnkpfkmchbfnclb)\n\nUnlike most of the other extensions I have seen, it uses declarativeNetRequests to append the query \"?useskin=vector\" to all Wikipedia URLs. The benefit from this is that it also works with URLs that already contain a query or an anchor. Also, declarativeNetRequest proves to be much faster than many other techniques, since it is evaluated by the browser itself and not by the extension.\n\nFor those interested, the code can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/adlerzei/old-wiki](https://github.com/adlerzei/old-wiki)\n\nI would really appreciate some users, feedback and of course positive reviews on the web store.",

It shouldn't close every time I click a new link, it should default to my preference.\n\nThere could also be a bit more of an obvious barrier between the sidebar and the main page, but that's a more minor gripe than anything. \n\nAnd also you should give it the treatment Youtube has given to their sidebar. Where I can scroll the sidebar itself, separately from the main page.\n\n2) The toggle on the bottom right of the page should remember what setting I chose from the previous page.

It should just remember my last used setting so that I can keep the one I prefer on.\n\n3) Why doesn't the top bar follow us as we scroll down the page? Seriously, if you're going for the modern look then why doesn't it follow me down as I scroll? The top left of the page that says wikipedia, the dropdown menu, and the search bar should follow me down the page as I scroll.\n\nWhy not have an option to hide the top bar if you want the website to look cleaner?

        "text": "As I've been invited to share my thoughts on Vector 2022 to the Wikimedia team, I thought I'd paste my opinion here. It seems my opinions echo the sentiment of many of you.\n\n&gt;Hi, I have used the new desktop experience (reluctantly at first) on the French and English Wikipedia, switching between it and the Timeless skin depending on my mood and device.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My biggest gripe about Vector 2022 definitely has to be the very low content density. I have seen a fullscreen/widescreen button appear at the bottom right this past month. It is a very welcome improvement and, when toggled on, I think I prefer Vector 2022 over Timeless. However, at the moment, the toggle seems to reset at each page change; which is a massive design flaw in my opinion, as, if the user switches to a widescreen view, they are likely to want to use this view for the whole session. The preference should be saved in a cookie so as to not be reset to the very narrow default view every time the user loads a new page. I also do not understand why this setting doesn't appear on my other screens. I am guessing the button is disabled if the screen seems too narrow, but I can assure you my MBP 14 and iPad Pro would welcome a wider Vector 2022 with open arms. Please make this button available everywhere, please.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My second gripe with it is how there is still no dark mode for Wikipedia. I have currently some script enabled for that but it is simply not as good as having a native dark mode; it does not auto-toggle depending on the system setting and when viewing more complex pages (such as ones with intricate tables), the colors can become unreadable.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Also, I do not understand why the language pop-up is so small. I have a 4K desktop screen, and the pop-up won't occupy more than what seems like 20% of my screen's vertical real-estate. This is, again, a density issue; it is not a design improvement if I lose information behind infinitely long scrollbars. Not only that but, the columns design inside the language pop-up could use some extra work. When I open the pop-up, I will always see the \"Suggested languages\" section but, because it doesn't contain enough languages to be displayed on multiple columns, only 1/4 of the horizontal space of the pop-up is used. Couple that with the small vertical size, and it makes for a, surprisingly, less intuitive and more time-consuming language discovery experience than before; in spite of the very welcome search feature.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lastly, there are still some inconsistencies between the desktop and mobile themes, but this is a lesser issue as Vector 2022 is a massive improvement compared to previous versions of the theme.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you to all of the Wikimedia teams all around the world for all of this hard work. Even though it is not perfect, I am glad to see Vector 2022 come to fruition.",

        "text": "Despite supposedly an update aimed at improving readability and feature accessibility, they've done the opposite by hiding so many items behind an extra click.\n\n1. The sidebar's existence is not intuitive, and it's absurd that opening it up replaces the Table of Contents. Realistically the sidebar should always be present as a one-stop shop for useful links you need. Also, when the sidebar is active... the ToC is hidden underneath it rather than being clearly visible at the top of the article. If they want the ToC to be so obvious, it should be at the top of the article, and then accessible via the floating title bar (that's only possible when you click 'hide table of contents).\n\n2. This also extends to languages. The claim it's now more obvious, but really it's now pushed to a small place where browsing languages is an extra step\n\n3. Opening menus will now result in content being hidden as they're in pop-outs. So not only are you having to click in-out of them, you lose some content to their existence.\n\nSo yeah, bit of a UX nightmare really. Glad those of us with accounts can return to the old one at least.",
