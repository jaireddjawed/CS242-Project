He’s sitting on a shelf that is same level as my head and he’s like 6 inches away from my face. I got a weirdly close-up look at his pale skin under its very thin body fuzz, and his little rat tail was wiggling. He was the size of a large cat. It was kind of cool but also very creepy. Why are you digging around in my yard storage area, opossum?",

You cant have it both ways while prices rise. You cant be annoyed by people who cant afford a place to stay while simultaneously being against living wages because you think it will somehow be harder on you.\n\nI currently work under a contract where basically i dont get full benefits while having the possibility of losing my job for no good reason or being laid off. Companies in the U.S. have lost their appreciation for workers and only see them as exploitable commodities. They work people literally to death, clean their desk, then hire someone new within a week just to do the same thing over again alll for scraps.",

I’ve let numerous managers know about the harassment/ bullying and nothing has been done. \n\nThis time they seemed supportive and told me they would be talking to people on the team and also gave me the number for HR. I spoke with the company’s HR rep and she is going to be doing an investigation.\n\nAfter two years of no action and me now being in severe mental distress, having crippling anxiety and a new found depression…Are there any laws that can protect me?

First it's waiting for his arrival to see who he is, what he looks like, what he's wearing and trying to figure out his personality and usually the guy is kinda awkward at first and i just love it. Idek what i like about this and it feels almost creepy bc i don't feel this way with meeting new girls. It was one of those nights tonight. I wish i was god so i could sit there and watch these people whenever i want and i'd be invisible so they wouldn't even know i'm watching them. I wonder if this guy i met tonight knows how fun it was seeing him. I wonder if he feels creeped out or flattered if he knew?",

        "text": " \n\nSo, there is a girl I met last semester in one of my classes, and I enjoyed talking to her. I looked forward to seeing her before every class. She was such a good person and such a joy to talk to. I then started developing romantic feelings for her, and I asked her out. She gave me an answer that resembled a \"not right now\", but it honestly could have been a no. I understood, and I admit I took it a bit hard, but I tried not to let that get between us. For the rest of the semester, we talked as normal before and after classes.\n\nThen, following the semester, we mostly talked over Snapchat, and I made a really stupid mistake. I just unadded her on Snap and removed her as a follower (and unfollowed her) on Instagram. This was because of me asking her a question on New Years, and her giving me what I first thought was a dry response (looking back it wasn't dry).\n\nI added her back on Snapchat and re-requested her on Instagram to apologize and explain myself. I miss having her around to talk to. As much as I hated the class I was in, I always looked forward to it because I could see her and speak with her. She lightened up my day.\n\nShould I say something along the lines of \"Hey, I'm sorry I unadded you on IG and on Snapchat. It was stupid and immature of me. The truth is, I still had feelings for you and still talking to you made those feelings stronger. You are so sweet and intelligent, and that's what made me attracted to you. If you don't feel the same way, I respect it. I want to be friends with you because talking to you and getting to know you was such a joy, and I looked forward to seeing you before class every time.\"\n\nI know it seems like infatuation to some people, but she literally made me feel feelings I haven't felt since high school. When I see cute girls, I often think to myself, \"she's cute.\" But with her, it's different. I am not attracted to her because of her body. I fell in love with her personality, her smile, and the energy she radiates. I could talk to her for hours and never get bored. Every time I see a message from her or I see her in person, I get giddy, and I feel happiness in my heart that no-one has ever given me before. \n\nIf this is creepy, please let me know! The last thing I want is for something to happen to me because of something dumb. I talked to 2 of my friends, and they said to not do it, and to forget about it. I also talked to a female friend, and she said to go for it, and that is is not creepy. \n\nAlso, I did unadd her on Snap before once, then I readded her back (I don't remember why, but I believe it was something with my Snap app, and not a personal issue). \n\nBTW, she hasn't added me back on either.",

        "text": "A little background. I haven't been in a romantic relationship for a long time now and am not planning on pursuing anything with anyone for a couple of years. I'm focusing on my career right now and that has always been my priority. My last relationship ended during COVID lockdown and it ended badly. I had to be the one to break-up with her whilst still having feelings for her. It sucked. I had been dumped before, but doing the dumping was just as bad. Anyway, it had to be done. We weren't compatible. She didn't understand it back then but she does now. We haven't talked or met at all since then. My feelings for her have also faded away and even though I've always been a romantic person, I no longer miss her and focusing on my work helps.\n\nFor a couple of months, I've had this girl visit me in my dreams multiple times. She's definitely not any of my exes. I can never recall, recognize or remember her face after waking up. I don't even know if I've already met her or will ever meet her some day. I just know that she's \"the one\". All my dreams that include her are not NSFW. They're just happy, sweet and lovely. I can't remember the last time I've felt this happy. All we do is talk, hangout, hold hands and walk through nature (I'm not a teenager, mid-20s). All I know about her is that when she's there, I feel happy beyond words. I wake up smiling whenever I dream about her. And I can describe everything about her, just not her face. These dreams have occurred multiple times for a couple of months and I just feel really weird. It's like my brain is coming up with an imaginary soulmate because I'm avoiding romantic encounters. It's beautiful and sad simultaneously. But man, she's beautiful as hell. Smart enough to understand my nerdy jokes too. I wish that she exists and we meet some day soon, but for now, I want these dreams to end. It's unhealthy and weird.\n\nAny of you guys relate? If yes, what'd you do about it?",

I got marked down on things that weren't mentioned in the handbook as well) \nToday I just received a 43%. I was really confident in my report too!\n\nMy module is very strict on deadlines so I don't expect to be able to redo it, but I'm going to try nonetheless, hopefully my demonstrator can laugh about it and give me a better grade.\n\nI know very little about education systems outside of my own. Do other countries leave their students so woefully unprepared for college? In such ways as this as well? \n\nAnother example, is that in 1st-3rd year science, we were actually taught a simplified, incorrect version of how electron levels work in the atom. We were even taught the wrong terminology. \n\nWhen you hit 5th year chemistry (4th year doesn't cover this), your teacher will say 'Ah, what you learned in the junior cert was simplified and wrong. This is how it actually works'.\n\nIsn't that ridiculous? I can't believe I spent 6 years having my brain wired by the Irish system just to find out that I could've been taught it wrong, just so that it's 'easier to learn/teach'. Like CMON, students aren't stupid, mostly just lazy.\n\nI'm starting to question what else I've learned and might be completely incorrect that will have my grade marked down. \n\nA bad grade won't ruin my life. But it is painful to think that stuff I dedicated years of my life to studying is potentially all wrong. Mandatory stuff too!",

        "text": "I bought my first ever non-junker 4 months ago, which is a 2011 Audi A4 Avant. It’s a gorgeous car with lots of nice features I never had from my past beaters, and I got it for half its market value because the turbo didn’t work and the engine light was on for some faulty sensors.\n\nI thought it was no big deal because it still gets up to 90mph no problem even without the turbo, and faulty sensors shouldn’t be THAT expensive…. Well boy was I wrong 😅\n\nAfter sending my car into a local mechanic shop that specializes in European cars yesterday, I got a call back with the quote to replace all the parts; the price was $6000 🙃\n\nThe turbo alone is worth more than what I spent on the car and if I go through with the quote, I’d end up paying $9000 for the car altogether 😭\n\nWhat’s most surprising is the previous owner said it shouldn’t cost more than $1500 to replace the turbo, because that was the quote (for the turbo only) he got when he had them inspect the car, but what he didn’t tell me was he got that information Pre-COVID!!\n\nSo earlier I was sitting in Starbucks trying to figure out if I really want to spend more than what the car is worth to fix it up.\n\nMy saving grace from this day becoming a full-blown bad day was when I decided to open my Starbucks app to order some coffee. My aunt bought me a Starbucks gift card years ago that I completely forgot about and I think this is her way of saying “MoistBrowntowel just chill out, you’re gonna be fine no matter what you decide so enjoy some coffee”\n\nSo that was a nice surprise and I even got my mom an iced tea so we can share the nice moment together ☺️\n\nThank Auntie! You saved my day from becoming an anxiety ridden disaster ❤️",

It definitely helps that I have been working on the field for a while, and I’ve always been pretty good at school, so I was looking into credit by exam options for that degree.  If I do that, combined with the accelerated program my college offers, I could potentially get a bachelor’s + masters degree in 3-4 years or so. I would probably be choosing a business/accounting degree with a path towards a MBA. \n\nTo me it sound really promising, but I’m not sure if it’ll be worth the time and dedication to do so. I’m already a lot older than the average college student and I have great experience on paper, but I’ve been struggling to move up the ladder as I’ve mentioned before.

Well! I didn't know what I was missing. The cost is down from a decade ago and WOW. My teeth feel so great. \n\nAnother one was buying a safety razor. I was looking for ways to reduce plastic waste and I struggled with really bad ingrown hairs. The single blade completely stopped all of that. And they are so easy to use. I buy a box of 1000 blades for like 10 dollars and they last me over a year. My husband even stopped spending 70 dollars on razors and steals mine to shave. I always recommend you upgrade to a safety razor. It is so much nicer and saves so much money!\n\nHave you tried something that's made a huge impact in your daily life? Using glass jars a Tupperware containers? Swapping paper towels for washable kitchen towels? Adding a bidet attachment?",

        "text": "When I was a kid, I had two beta fish. They were both in an empty small aquarium, with plastic rocks in the ground. One was very depressed and spent its days hiding behind the sticker on the glass. The other one, I fell in love with. It had a very cute personality. I did everything I knew I should so, I cleaned up the aquarium, I feed the fish, I took it to the fish shop when it started to suffer from fin rot. I saw it die slowly, and have its chirping personality wither. We bought special shrimp food to make it start eating again, but it didn’t impede its death. My extended family didn’t think I would care for a fish and jokingly asked if I feed it properly.\nNow, I accompany a lot of aquarium owners. I would love to maintain a little environment. To keep the nitrogen levels on the waters safe, to have a heater, a lamp, a filter, several plants, real rocks and bark, shrimp, several fish and make them all feel safe and happy. But I know it costs money, time and discipline. Now, I’m a college student and don’t know if I’ll ever be able to afford keeping a proper aquarium. I don’t want to mess up with fishes’ lives. \nSo, aquarium owners, did you one day think you would have such a beautiful aquarium? Did you make mistakes that you still regret? And does your friend and family not understand your attachment towards fish?",

It makes me feel soooo stressed out and then I just give up because I feel so tense, stressed, and overwhelmed. Is that normal or is it just me? Like I need to take a breathing break just to calm myself down from stress, I know I'm overthinking this but this is just how I am. I literally stress about everything I do. Yesterday I was playing guitar and I kept messing up the song and I felt so stressed I had to stop to breathe and I felt kinda achy in my body. My heart started pounding too. I even tried again today and the same thing, I messed up, needed to breathe and I got so mad at myself. I wish I could stop stressing out and enjoy things. I probably sound really weird but this is really how I react when I'm stressed. I wish I could just calm down for once, I also have OCD so my mind is always running and stressing out about something.",

A part of me is feeling super guilty about it but another is telling me it was fine and that it's not the end of the world. I could use some second opinions and advice.",
