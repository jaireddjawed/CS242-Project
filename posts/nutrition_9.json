She told me that I am killing myself by not eating meat even though I make good filling protein rich meals. I am trying my best to research how to stay healthy as a vegetarian and get full nutrition but every source I see is ultimately biased in one way or another. I stumbled upon r/ exvegan and they claim that veganism gave them autoimmune disorders and ruined their joints. I became very concerned by this but couldn't find any clearcut answer. \n\nSo can you not consume meat, milk, and eggs and stay healthy? Are you missing out on any nutrients and if yes then what is a way around it? Is there a correlation between veganism and autoimmune issues?",

Naturally this was in response to a question about whey and plant based proteins. \n\nI recall a similar discussion about the amino acid profile with respect to the Netflix documentary \"The Game Changers\", when some of the early critiques pointed out plant based protein and the lack of a full amino acid profile. \n\nI think it's a very reasonable position that a balanced diet will provide all the amino acids we need, but my question back then and my question after reading that discussion a few days ago is simply... for the average person, does the amino acid profile really matter? \n\nFor instance, for someone not trying to be an Olympic or elite athlete, would the amino acid profile actively work against somebody whose primary goal is just to maintain a healthy lifestyle? I can't help but wonder if some of the discussions I hear at the gym and with colleagues is a bit of splitting hairs?",

So, if not from the diet, where are the carbohydrates coming from in sugar burners if removed from the diet? \n\nSince muscle glycogen cannot mobilized unless contracting/exercising, how could the body continue to burn mostly carbs for several days on low carb diet with energy deficit? Liver glycogen stores are pretty modest at 400kcals - which could easily be burned through a night's sleep. \n\nMost text I have read suggests that the absorptive period is about 3-5 hours - do larger meals digest substantially beyond this period? Can a large meal with substantial CHO in the evening take 8-10 hours to digest and absorb? \n\nLet me know if I am missing something here! Thanks!",

Let me start by saying I know everyone has different nutritional needs, and what works for some might not work for others. \n\nDoes anyone have input or information on hitting a plateau after doing intermittent fasting for a long period of time? Such as: More tired than usual, lower libido, and so on. I know this can be caused by different things, but curious if the time restricted eating can contribute to this. I know I’m general, it’s good to mix things up, so maybe taking a “break” from intermittent fasting is necessary every few months?\n\nI also listened to a couple of podcasts this morning on the importance of a protein packed breakfast, and eating within an hour of waking. Any thoughts on this in conjunction to intermittent fasting? Maybe continuing time restricted eating, but moving the window earlier in the day to include breakfast? \n\nSorry this post is a bit all over the place, but I appreciate any input!",

Or do you use any of the extra coaching features, e.g. letting the app recommend how much you should eat?\n\nJust generally curious how most people use these so I can make sure the common use-cases are supported.

I'm curious if there's evidence for that link.\n\nAnd when digestion is happening, your HRV will be lower and RHR will be higher, so I'm curious about blood glucose and the effect of different macros, to the extent there's any good evidence on those questions.\n\nThanks in advance!",
